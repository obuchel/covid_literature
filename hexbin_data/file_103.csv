186,186,186,Multiorgan failure due to hemophagocytic syndrome: A case report,14.718973,9.615573,2008-10-03,"INTRODUCTION: Hemophagocytic syndrome (HFS) is a potentially lethal disorder due to an uncontrolled immune response to a triggering agent. Our objective is to raise the importance of HFS early diagnosis by presenting a representative case. CASE PRESENTATION: A sixteen-year-old girl with Still disease diagnosis developed a progressive multiorgan failure including acute respiratory distress (ARDS), anemia and thrombopenia, elevated liver enzymes, renal failure, coagulopathy with hypofibrinogenemia, and acute phase reactants elevation despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. A bone marrow puncture-biopsy was performed, and hemophagocytosis was found. Prolonged fever, splenomegaly, bicytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, hyperferritinemia and hypertriglyceridemia confirmed HFS diagnosis. She received intensive care support therapy including mechanical ventilation and specific therapy according to HLH 2004 protocol, with a very good response. CONCLUSION: Our case shows complexity of HFS diagnosis, due to septic shock-like manifestations. Early diagnosis is essential to start appropriate treatment achieving a better outcome.","Mayordomo-Colunga, Juan; Rey, Corsino; González, Soledad; Concha, Andrés",Cases J,103,0
352,352,352,Pneumonitis as A Consequence of (Peg)Interferon-Ribavirin Combination Therapy for Hepatitis C: a Review of the Literature,14.872479,9.742189,2009-04-28,"Combination of peginterferon and ribavirin is the current therapy for chronic hepatitis C infection (HCV). Interstitial pneumonitis is a rare side-effect of HCV therapy and is an important cause of dose reduction or discontinuation, impairing success of antiviral therapy. We performed a review of the literature in order to present diagnostic modalities and possible treatments for pneumonitis and to offer guidelines. We searched for cases where pneumonitis as a side-effect of HCV treatment was documented. First we performed a literature search via PubMed and Web of Science interface and second we searched three drug toxicity databases. We systematically analyzed all case reports with respect to clinical manifestations, type of treatment, and outcome. A literature search revealed 19 articles, containing 25 case descriptions, while we traced 33 cases from the drug toxicity databases. Pneumonitis presented with any of the combination of fever, dyspnea, and cough and can arise with any type of (conventional or pegylated) interferon. Mortality secondary to pneumonitis was seen in 7% of cases, exclusively with peginterferon α-2b. In most cases therapy was discontinued and steroids were started. Interferon-induced pneumonitis during HCV treatment is a severe complication and should be recognized in order to prevent further pulmonary damage and/or death.","Slavenburg, Serena; Heijdra, Yvonne F.; Drenth, Joost P.

654,654,654,A Chinese Herbal Formula to Improve General Psychological Status in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial on Sichuan Earthquake Survivors,14.836577,9.468448,2011-10-19,"Introduction. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is accompanied by poor general psychological status (GPS). In the present study, we investigated the effects of a Chinese herbal formula on GPS in earthquake survivors with PTSD. Methods. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial compared a Chinese herbal formula, Xiao-Tan-Jie-Yu-Fang (XTJYF), to placebo in 2008 Sichuan earthquake survivors with PTSD. Patients were randomized into XTJYF (n = 123) and placebo (n = 122) groups. Baseline-to-end-point score changes in the three global indices of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) and rates of response in the SCL global severity index (GSI) were the primary endpoints. A subanalysis of the nine SCL factors and the sleep quality score were secondary endpoints. Results and Discussion. Compared to placebo, the XTJYF group was significantly improved in all three SCL global indices (P = 0.001~0.028). More patients in the XTJYF group reported “much improved” than the placebo group (P = 0.001). The XTJYF group performed significantly better than control in five out of nine SCL factors (somatization, obsessive-compulsive behavior, depression, anxiety, and hostility (P = 0.001~0.036)), and in sleep quality score (P < 0.001). XTJYF produced no serious adverse events. These findings suggest that XTJYF may be an effective and safe treatment option for improving GPS in patients with PTSD.","Meng, Xian-Ze; Wu, Feng; Wei, Pin-Kang; Xiu, Li-Juan; Shi, Jun; Pang, Bin; Sun, Da-Zhi; Qin, Zhi-Feng; Huang, Yi; Lao, Lixing",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,103,22

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients with laboratory confirmed Penicilliummarneffei infection admitted to the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Hanoi, Vietnam, between July 2006 and September 2009. RESULTS: 127 patients with P. marneffei infection were identified. All were HIV-infected; median CD4+ T-cell count was 24 cells/μl (IQR:12-48); 76% were men. Common clinical features were fever (92.9%), skin lesions (82.6%), hepatomegaly (61.4%), lymphadenopathy (40.2%), weight loss (59.1%) and cough (49.6%). Concurrent opportunistic infections were present in 22.0%; half of those had tuberculosis. Initial treatment regimens were: itraconazole or ketoconazole capsule (77.2%), amphotericin B (20.5%), and fluconazole (1.6%). In-hospital mortality was 12.6% and showed no significant difference in patients treated with itraconazole (or ketoconazole) and amphotericin B (p = 0.43). Dyspnea, ascites, and increased LDH level were independent predictors of mortality. No seasonality was observed. CONCLUSION: The clinical features, treatments and outcomes of HIV-associated P. marneffei infection in northern Vietnam are similar to those reported in other endemic regions. Dyspnea was an important predictor of mortality. More patients were treated with itraconazole than amphotericin B and no significant difference in treatment outcome was observed. It would be of clinical value to compare the efficacy of oral itraconazole and amphotericin B in a clinical trial.","Larsson, Mattias; Nguyen, Lien Ha Thi; Wertheim, Heiman FL; Dao, Trinh Tuyet; Taylor, Walter; Horby, Peter; Nguyen, Trung Vu; Nguyen, Minh Ha Thi; Le, Thuy; Nguyen, Kinh Van",AIDS Res Ther,103,1

METHODS: The clinical progress in 18 H7N9-infected patients was monitored and recorded. The clinical features of H7N9 infection were noted and factors associated with treatment outcomes were analyzed by univariate analyses. RESULTS: The average ages of patients in recovered and critical conditions were 67.0±10.83 years and 72.75±12.0 years, respectively. Renal insufficiency developed more frequently in critically ill patients (P = 0.023). The duration of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) therapy was longer in recovered patients than in critically ill patients (P = 0.01). Laboratory tests showed that levels of C-reactive protein, serum creatinine, and myoglobin were significantly higher in critically ill patients than in recovered patients (P = 0.011, 0.04, and 0.016, respectively). Meanwhile, levels of all T cell subsets examined including total CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), and CD45(+) T cells were lower in critically ill patients than in recovered patients (P = 0.033, 0.059, 0.015, and 0.039, respectively). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that C-reactive protein level, myoglobin level and TCM therapy duration were likely associated with treatment outcomes of H7N9 infection (P = 0.032, 0.041 and 0.017, respectively). CONCLUSION: Elderly people may have increased risk for H7N9 virus infection. T cell-mediated responses play an important role in defense against the H7N9 virus. C-reactive protein level, myoglobin level and TCM duration may be associated with treatment outcomes of H7N9 infection.","Chen, Xiaorong; Yang, Zongguo; Lu, Yunfei; Xu, Qingnian; Wang, Qiang; Chen, Liang",PLoS One,103,28
1570,1570,1570,"Mimiviridae, Marseilleviridae, and virophages as emerging human pathogens causing healthcare-associated infections",14.875911,9.831856,2014-08-19,"Aim: During the last decade it became obvious that viruses belonging to Mimiviridae and Marseilleviridae families (order Megavirales), may be potential causative agents of pneumonia. Thus, we have performed a review of the association of Mimiviridae, Marseilleviridae, and virophages with pneumonia, particularly healthcare-associated pneumonia, and other infections of the respiratory tract. Results and discussion: According to the analysis of the published articles, viruses belonging to Mimiviridae family can be potential agents of both community-acquired and healthcare-associated pneumonia. In particular, these viruses may be associated with poor outcome in patients of intensive care units. The exact mechanism of their pathogenicity, however, still remains unclear. The discrepancies between the results obtained by serological and genomic methods could be explained by the high polymorphism of nucleotide sequences of Mimiviridae family representatives. Further investigations on the Mimiviridae pathogenicity and on the determination of Mimiviridae-caused pneumonia risk groups are required. However, the pathogenicity of the viruses belonging to Marseilleviridae family and virophages is unclear up to now.","Kutikhin, Anton G.; Yuzhalin, Arseniy E.; Brusina, Elena B.",GMS Hyg Infect Control,103,11

2964,2964,2964,Patterns of infectious complications in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes patients treated with 10‐day decitabine regimen,14.886211,9.569702,2017-10-23,"Decitabine has been explored as a reduced‐intensity therapy for older or unfit patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To better understand the risk of infections during decitabine treatment, we retrospectively examined the culture results from each infection‐related serious adverse event that occurred among 85 AML and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients treated in a prospective clinical study using 10‐day cycles of decitabine at Washington University School of Medicine. Culture results were available for 163 infection‐related complications that occurred in 70 patients: 90 (55.2%) events were culture‐negative, 32 (19.6%) were gram‐positive bacteria, 20 (12.3%) were gram‐negative bacteria, 12 (7.4%) were mixed, 6 (3.7%) were viral, 2 (1.2%) were fungal, and 1 (0.6%) was mycobacterial. Infection‐related mortality occurred in 3/24 (13%) of gram‐negative events, and 0/51 gram‐positive events. On average, nearly one third of patients experienced an infection‐related complication with each cycle, and the incidence did not decrease during later cycles. In summary, in patients receiving 10‐day decitabine, infectious complications are common and may occur during any cycle of therapy. Although febrile events are commonly culture‐negative, gram‐positive infections are the most frequent source of culture‐positive infections, but gram‐negative infections represent a significant risk of mortality in AML and MDS patients treated with decitabine.","Ali, Alaa M.; Weisel, Daniel; Gao, Feng; Uy, Geoffrey L.; Cashen, Amanda F.; Jacoby, Meagan A.; Wartman, Lukas D.; Ghobadi, Armin; Pusic, Iskra; Romee, Rizwan; Fehniger, Todd A.; Stockerl‐Goldstein, Keith E.; Vij, Ravi; Oh, Stephen T.; Abboud, Camille N.; Schroeder, Mark A.; Westervelt, Peter; DiPersio, John F.; Welch, John S.",Cancer Med,103,22

All cases were evaluated, and four controls that were matched by the epidemiological week of hospitalization of the case were randomly selected for each case. Cases and controls were selected from the National Disease Notification System-SINAN Influenza-web. The hospital records from 126 hospitals were evaluated, and home interviews were conducted using standardized forms. A total of 48 cases and 185 controls were investigated. Having had a previous health visit to a healthcare provider for an influenza episode before hospital admission was a risk factor for death (adjusted OR (OR(adj)) of 7.93, 95% CI 2.19–28.69). Although not significant in the multiple analysis (OR(adj) of 2.13, 95% CI 0.91–5.00), the 3(rd) trimester deserves attention, with an OR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.13–4.37 in the univariate analysis. Antiviral treatment was a protective factor when administered within 48 hours of symptom onset (OR(adj) = 0.16, 95% CI 0.05–0.50) and from 48 to 72 hours (OR(adj) = 0.09, 95% CI 0.01–0.87). There was a higher proportion of fetal deaths and preterm births among cases (p = 0.001) and live births with low weight (p = 0.019), compared to control subjects who gave birth during hospitalization. After discharge, control subjects had a favorable neonatal outcome. Early antiviral treatment during the presence of a flu-like illness is an important factor in reducing mortality from influenza in pregnant women and unfavorable neonatal outcomes. It is important to monitor pregnant women, particularly in the 3(rd) trimester of gestation, with influenza illness for diagnosis and early treatment.","Ribeiro, Ana Freitas; Pellini, Alessandra Cristina Guedes; Kitagawa, Beatriz Yuko; Marques, Daniel; Madalosso, Geraldine; Fred, Joao; Albernaz, Ricardo Kerti Mangabeira; Carvalhanas, Telma Regina Marques Pinto; Zanetta, Dirce Maria Trevisan",PLoS One,103,1

The home environment, particularly the kitchen and bathroom, serves as a reservoir of large numbers of microorganisms, particularly Enterobacteriacae,and infectious disease transmission has been demonstrated to occur in 6–60% of households in which one member is ill. Current food preparation and cleaning practices provide multiple opportunities for intra-household member spread. Routine cleaning is often sufficient, but in cases of household infection, may not adequately reduce environmental contamination. The effectiveness of disinfectants varies considerably and depends on how they are used as well as their intrinsic efficacy. The behavioral aspects of infection prevention in the home (e.g., foodhandling and cleaning practices) warrant increased public attention and education.","Kagan, Lori J.; Aiello, Allison E.; Larson, Elaine",J Community Health,103,1

METHODS: Prospective observational study comparing clinical and laboratory characteristics of Influenza A H1N1 positive and negative patients with influenza-like illness (ILI). RESULTS: From October 21, 2009 to February 14, 2010 196 ILI patients were admitted, of which 66 tested positive for Influenza A H1N1. The patients with H1N1 infection were younger (43 years vs. 65 years; P < 0.01), more patients were pregnant (P < 0.01), had allergies (P < 0.05) or, asthma (P < 0.01). H1N1 positive patients were more often febrile (91% vs. 72.9%; P < 0.01) and had a higher prevalence of headache (31.8% vs. 18.5%; P < 0.05).

RECENT FINDINGS: The existence of the brain RAS remains surprisingly controversial. New sensitive in situ hybridization techniques and novel transgenic animals expressing reporter genes have provided pivotal information of the expression of RAS genes within the brain. We discuss studies using genetically engineered animals combined with targeted viral microinjections to study molecular mechanisms implicated in the regulation of the brain RAS. We also discuss novel drugs targeting the brain RAS that have shown promising results in clinical studies and trials. SUMMARY: Over the last 50 years, several new physiological roles of the brain RAS have been identified. In the coming years, efforts to incorporate cutting-edge technologies such as optogenetics, chemogenetics, and single-cell RNA sequencing will lead to dramatic advances in our full understanding of how the brain RAS operates at molecular and neurophysiological levels.","Nakagawa, Pablo; Gomez, Javier; Grobe, Justin L.; Sigmund, Curt D.",Curr Hypertens Rep,103,1

The diagnosis was determined by confirming an increase of specific antibody. All patients were treated with minocycline, and all recovered, excluding one patient with a fulminant course. Fever and exanthema were observed in all patients, and an eschar was pointed out in 20 (71%) patients. The platelet count was 10 × 10(4)/μl or lower in 8 (28%) patients. The fibrin degradation product (FDP)-level was abnormally high, 10 μg/ml or more, in 16 (57%) patients. The creatine kinase (CK) value was high in 14 of 22 patients, suggesting the presence of myositis. The leukocyte count, FDP, C-reactive protein, and soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL2-R) levels were significantly higher in severe cases. In the group without concomitant steroid therapy, mean times of 54.7 h and 101.4 h were required to reduce the temperature to 38°C and 37°C or lower, respectively, after the initiation of tetracycline treatment. There were 6 severe cases: 1 with disseminated intravascular coagulation, 2 with multiorgan failure, 1 with acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 2 with meningoencephalitis. These severe cases formed a group that required 6 or more days to initiate therapy after the onset (P < 0.005 vs non-severe group), showing that delay in diagnosis and therapy is the major cause of aggravation. In the 2 patients complicated by multiorgan failure, the sIL2-R level, produced by activated lymphocytes, was 10 000 U/ml or higher, suggesting that an sIL2-R level of more than 10 000 U/ml can be used as a marker of poor prognosis. It may be better that moderate to severe cases are treated with minocycline plus short-term steroid therapy.","Kodama, Kazuya; Senba, Takanori; Yamauchi, Hayato; Nomura, Tetsuhiko; Chikahira, Yoshimi",J Infect Chemother,103,1

In addition to vaccine development and vector control, the search for antiviral agents that alleviate symptoms in patients are of considerable interest. Among others, the flaviviral protease NS2B-NS3 is a promising drug target to inhibit viral replication. Flaviviral proteases share a high degree of structural similarity and substrate-recognition profile, which may facilitate a strategy towards development of pan-flaviviral protease inhibitors. However, the success of various drug discovery attempts during the last decade has been limited by the nature of the viral enzyme as well as a lack of robust structural templates. Small-molecular, structurally diverse protease inhibitors have been reported to reach affinities in the lower micromolar range. Peptide-based, substrate-derived compounds are often nanomolar inhibitors, however, with highly compromised drug-likeness. With some exceptions, the antiviral cellular activity of most of the reported compounds have been patchy and insufficient for further development. Recent progress has been made in the elucidation of inhibitor binding using different structural methods. This will hopefully lead to more rational attempts for the identification of various lead compounds that may be successful in cellular assays, animal models and ultimately translated to patients.","Nitsche, Christoph",Dengue and Zika: Control and Antiviral Treatment Strategies,103,1

However, the cardiorespiratory physiology of these infants on each mode is unknown. METHODS: Prospective, randomized crossover study in infants with birth weight ≤1250 g undergoing their first extubation attempt. NCPAP and HFNC were applied randomly for 45 min each, while ribcage and abdominal movements, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) were recorded. Respiratory signals were analyzed using an automated method, and differences between NCPAP and HFNC features and changes in FiO(2) were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 30 infants with median [interquartile range] gestational age of 27 weeks [25.7, 27.9] and birth weight of 930 g [780, 1090] were studied. Infants were extubated at 5 days [2, 13] of life with 973 g [880, 1170] and three failed (10%). No differences in cardiorespiratory behavior were noted, except for longer respiratory pauses (9.2 s [5.0, 11.5] vs. 7.3 s [4.6, 9.3]; p = 0.04) and higher FiO(2) levels (p = 0.02) during HFNC compared to NCPAP. CONCLUSIONS: In extremely preterm infants studied shortly after extubation, the use of HFNC was associated with longer respiratory pauses and higher FiO(2) requirements.","Kanbar, Lara J.; Shalish, Wissam; Latremouille, Samantha; Rao, Smita; Brown, Karen A.; Kearney, Robert E.; Sant’Anna, Guilherme M.",Pediatr Res,103,1

Around one third of the variability in the risk of severe and complicated malaria is now explained by additive host genetic effects. Many individual variants have been identified that are associated with malaria protection, but the most important all relate to the structure or function of red blood cells. They include the classical polymorphisms that cause sickle cell trait, α-thalassaemia, G6PD deficiency, and the major red cell blood group variants. More recently however, with improving technology and experimental design, others have been identified that include the Dantu blood group variant, polymorphisms in the red cell membrane protein ATP2B4, and several variants related to the immune response. Characterising how these genes confer their effects could eventually inform novel therapeutic approaches to combat malaria. Nevertheless, all together, only a small proportion of the heritable component of malaria resistance can be explained by the variants described so far, underscoring its complex genetic architecture and the need for continued research.","Kariuki, Silvia N.; Williams, Thomas N.",Hum Genet,103,1

We present consensus list of prognostic factors for resolution of inflammation in TBU, by experts across the Asia-Pacific region. METHODS: We applied a modified Delphi technique to generate consensus on prognostic factors influencing the resolution of inflammation in TB-associated: anterior uveitis (AU), retinal vasculitis (RV), and multifocal serpiginoid choroiditis (MSC). The initial questionnaire was developed through a face-to-face meeting. Sixteen uveitis experts from eleven Asia-Pacific countries were included. A single investigator circulated the questionnaire electronically and received the responses. Participants scored each item on 4-point Likert scale, in three successive rounds. After each round, a number of items were reduced based on response, and summary of responses was provided to participants. At the end of Round 3, items were considered significant if they: (1) achieved a median ≥2, and interquartile range ≤1, and (2) ≥75% of the respondents agreed on whether the item was a positive or negative prognostic factor. RESULTS: Forty-two putative questionnaire items were considered. At the end of Rounds 3, 4, 9, and 8 items in AU, RV, and MSC, respectively, met significance criteria. These included duration of disease, previous corticosteroid/immunosuppressive therapy, co-existent HIV, disease-specific imaging features, multidrug resistant TB, and duration of anti-TB therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Consensus were achieved on multiple ocular and systemic factors that influence resolution of inflammation in TBU. These will form the groundwork for validation in prospective clinical trials.","Basu, Soumyava; La Distia Nora, Rina; Rao, Narsing A; Jiang, Xuejuan; Fuady, Ahmad",Eye (Lond),103,17

In this study, a biopolymer electrolyte inspired from natural materials was developed by using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as the core material and doped with varied ammonium carbonate (AC) composition. X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows the prepared CMC-AC electrolyte films exhibited low crystallinity content, X(c) (~30%) for sample AC7. A specific wavenumber range between 900–1200 cm(−1) and 1500–1800 cm(−1) was emphasized in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) testing, as this is the most probable interaction to occur. The highest ionic conductivity, σ of the electrolyte system achieved was 7.71 × 10(−6) Scm(−1) and appeared greatly dependent on ionic mobility, µ and diffusion coefficient, D. The number of mobile ions, η, increased up to the highest conducting sample (AC7) but it became less prominent at higher AC composition. The transference measurement, t(ion) showed that the electrolyte system was predominantly ionic with sample AC7 having the highest value (t(ion) = 0.98). Further assessment also proved that the H(+) ion was the main conducting species in the CMC-AC electrolyte system, which presumably was due to protonation of ammonium salt onto the complexes site and contributed to the overall ionic conductivity enhancement.","Sohaimy, Mohd Ibnu Haikal Ahmad; Isa, Mohd Ikmar Nizam Mohamad",Polymers (Basel),103,1

Symptoms of NASH become apparent when the disease has progressed significantly. Thus, there is a need to identify biomarkers of NASH in order to detect the disease earlier and to monitor disease severity. The inflammasome has been shown to play a role in liver diseases. Here, we performed a proof of concept study of biomarker analyses (cut-off points, positive and negative predictive values, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and likelihood ratios) on the serum of patients with NASH and healthy controls on apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), interleukin (IL)-18, Galectin-3 (Gal-3), and C-reactive protein (CRP). ASC, IL-18, and Gal-3 were elevated in the serum of NASH patients when compared to controls. The area under the curve (AUC) for ASC was the highest (0.7317) with an accuracy of 68%, followed by IL-18 (0.7036) with an accuracy of 66% and Gal-3 (0.6891) with an accuracy of 61%. Moreover, we then fit a stepwise multivariate logistic regression model using ASC, IL-18, and Gal-3 to determine the probability of patients having a NASH diagnosis, which resulted in an AUC of 0.71 and an accuracy of 79%, indicating that combining these biomarkers increases their diagnostic potential for NASH. These results indicate that ASC, IL-18, and Gal-3 are reliable biomarkers of NASH and that combining these analytes increases the biomarker potential of these proteins.","Cyr, Brianna; Keane, Robert W.; de Rivero Vaccari, Juan Pablo",Int J Mol Sci,103,17

Physical activity (PA) is part of a healthy lifestyle for diabetic patients; however, the role of PA in DN has not been clarified. Our aim was to conduct a meta-analysis to explore the association between PA and DN risk. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were systematically searched for articles examining PA in diabetic patients and its effect on renal function. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020191379). Results: A total of 38991 participants were identified from 18 studies. The results indicated that PA was associated with increases in the glomerular filtration rate (SMD = 0.01, 95% CI = [0.02–0.17]) and decreases in the urinary albumin creatinine ratio (SMD = −0.53, 95% CI: −0.72 to −0.34), rate of microalbuminuria (OR = 0.61, 95% CI = [0.46–0.81]), rate of acute kidney injury (OR = 0.02, 95% CI = [0.01–0.04]), rate of renal failure (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = [0.52–0.97]) and risk of DN in patients with Type 1 diabetes (OR = 0.67, 95% CI = [0.51–0.89]). Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicated that PA is effective for improving DN and slowing its progression; however, more high-quality randomized controlled trials are required on this topic.","Cai, Zixin; Yang, Yan; Zhang, Jingjing",Biosci Rep,103,28

A crucial element of the One Health includes preparation and response to influenza A virus (IAV) threats at the human-animal interface. The IAVs are characterized by extensive genetic variability, they circulate among different hosts and can establish host-specific lineages. The four main hosts are: avian, swine, human and equine, with occasional transmission to other mammalian species. The host diversity is mirrored in the range of the RT-qPCR assays for IAV detection. Different assays are recommended by the responsible health authorities for generic IAV detection in birds, swine or humans. In order to unify IAV monitoring in different hosts and apply the One Health approach, we developed a single RT-qPCR assay for universal detection of all IAVs of all subtypes, species origin and global distribution. The assay design was centred on a highly conserved region of the IAV matrix protein (MP)-segment identified by a comprehensive analysis of 99,353 sequences. The reaction parameters were effectively optimised with efficiency of 93–97% and LOD(95%) of approximately ten IAV templates per reaction. The assay showed high repeatability, reproducibility and robustness. The extensive in silico evaluation demonstrated high inclusivity, i.e. perfect sequence match in the primers and probe binding regions, established as 94.6% for swine, 98.2% for avian and 100% for human H3N2, pandemic H1N1, as well as other IAV strains, resulting in an overall predicted detection rate of 99% on the analysed dataset.

Critically ill SRD patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were studied to gain insight into their characteristics and outcomes. METHODS: This French monocenter, retrospective study included all SRD patients requiring venovenous (VV)- or venoarterial (VA)-ECMO admitted to a 26-bed ECMO-dedicated ICU from January 2006 to February 2020. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Ninety patients (male/female ratio: 0.5; mean age at admission: 41.6 ± 15.2 years) admitted to the ICU received VA/VV-ECMO, respectively, for an SRD-related flare (n = 69, n = 38/31) or infection (n = 21, n = 10/11). SRD was diagnosed in-ICU for 31 (34.4%) patients. In-ICU and in-hospital mortality rates were 48.9 and 51.1%, respectively. Nine patients were bridged to cardiac (n = 5) or lung transplantation (n = 4), or left ventricular assist device (n = 2). The Cox multivariable model retained the following independent predictors of in-hospital mortality: in-ICU SRD diagnosis, day-0 Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II score ≥ 70 and arterial lactate ≥ 7.5 mmol/L for VA-ECMO–treated patients; diagnosis other than vasculitis, day-0 SAPS II score ≥ 70, ventilator-associated pneumonia and arterial lactate ≥ 7.5 mmol/L for VV-ECMO–treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: ECMO support is a relevant rescue technique for critically ill SRD patients, with 49% survival at hospital discharge. Vasculitis was independently associated with favorable outcomes of VV-ECMO–treated patients.

We found shared alterations in aging-associated and infection-associated chronic inflammation including T cell memory inflation, up-regulation of intracellular signaling pathways of inflammation, and diminished sensitivity to cytokines in lymphocytes and myeloid cells. In the HIV cohort, these dysregulations were evident despite viral suppression for over 10 y. Viral clearance in the HCV cohort partially restored cellular sensitivity to interferon-α, but many immune system alterations persisted for at least 1 y posttreatment. Our findings indicate that in the HIV and HCV cohorts, a broad remodeling and degradation of the immune system can persist for a year or more, even after the removal or drastic reduction of the pathogen load and that this shares some features of chronic inflammation in aging.","Lopez Angel, Cesar J.; Pham, Edward A.; Du, Huixun; Vallania, Francesco; Fram, Benjamin J.; Perez, Kevin; Nguyen, Thai; Rosenberg-Hasson, Yael; Ahmed, Aijaz; Dekker, Cornelia L.; Grant, Philip M.; Khatri, Purvesh; Maecker, Holden T.; Glenn, Jeffrey S.; Davis, Mark M.; Furman, David",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,103,22

OBJECTIVES: To determine the epidemiology (incidence, nature and root causes) of PSIs at a long-term rehabilitative hospital between April 2011 and March 2016. METHOD: Data were collected through a review and analysis of routinely collected hospital information on patient records and from the PSI register, as well as minutes of adverse health events meetings, quality assurance reports and patient complaints register. RESULTS: A total or 4.12 PSIs per 10 000 inpatient days were reported. Approximately 52% of the adverse health events occurred in females with most of the adverse health events occurring in the 50–59 years category: 96% being reported during the day and 33% within the shift change. Pressure ulcers, falls, injury, hospital acquired infections and medication error were the most commonly reported PSIs. Patient factors were listed as the most common root cause for the PSIs. CONCLUSION: The study shows a low reporting rate of PSIs whilst showing a diverse pattern of PSIs over a period of 5 years. There is a need for active change management in order to establish a blame-free culture and learning environment to improve reporting of PSI.

The need for increased dairy beef integration has assumed a greater importance in Ireland in recent years due to a rapid expansion in dairy production, and associated increase in numbers of male dairy calves born on Irish farms. The objective of this study was to explore beef farmers' views on a broad range of issues related to dairy beef integration, using a survey methodology. The survey was distributed to approximately 4,250 beef farmers via email and 1,203 participated in the study. Results: The sample was composed almost entirely of beef farmers, although a very small proportion also had a dairy enterprise on their farm. Eighty percent of the farmers were concerned with the increase in the number of male dairy calves in recent years. Fifty seven percent of farmers responded that they were not willing to rear dairy bred calves for beef. Limousin, Aberdeen Angus and Hereford were the breeds farmers would be most willing to rear for beef. Good health, breed, and conformation were ranked as the main factors calf rearers consider when buying calves. Expectation of poor profit margin, expectation of poor-quality calves, and price volatility/market uncertainty were the top ranked factors dissuading farmers from rearing dairy calves for beef. The main themes arising from the qualitative question related to beef price/ability to make a profit, breed, and calf quality. Conclusions: While it is concerning that the majority of respondents expressed an unwillingness to rear dairy bred calves for beef, approximately a quarter of beef farmers indicated a willingness to rear beef-sired dairy calves for beef. In the qualitative responses, farmers described how their concerns about calf quality and their ability to make a profit from dairy bred calves would make it difficult for them to rear these calves for beef. Future strategy will have to consider how these challenges can be overcome and the issues of who bears the risks and costs associated with greater integration will have to be carefully considered.","Maher, James W.; Clarke, AnneMarie; Byrne, Andrew William; Doyle, Rob; Blake, Martin; Cromie, Andrew; Barrett, Damien",Front Vet Sci,103,13

We aimed to compare the parenteral nutrition (PN) regimen with the current guidelines, evaluate weight gain and explore the correlation of parenteral macronutrient and energy intakes with weight gain outcome in preterm infants with birth weight less than 1500 g. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted. Parenteral macronutrients and energy intakes were described. Weight gain during PN was assessed. Nutritional factors associated with weight gain outcome after PN were identified using a cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: A total of 163 infants were included in this study, in which 41 were extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants and 122 were very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. Average glucose, amino acid, lipid, and energy during the first postnatal week were 7.5 g/kg/d, 2.4 g/kg/d, 0.8 g/kg/d, 48 kcal/kg/d. Median maximum glucose, amino acid, lipid, and energy were 11.1 g/kg/d, 3.5 g/kg/d, 3 g/kg/d, 78 kcal/kg/d. Median days to maximum glucose, amino acid, lipid, and energy were 10, 9, 12, 11 days. The proportion of appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants was 76.9%. The ratio of infants without poor weight gain outcome after PN was 38%. With every 0.1 g/kg/d decrease of maximum amino acid and average lipid during the first postnatal week, the probability of appropriate weight gain outcome decreased by 77.6 and 74.4% respectively. With each additional day to maximum glucose and energy, the probability of appropriate weight gain outcome decreased by 5.6 and 6.1% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Most preterm infants with birth weight less than 1500 g remain below the latest recommended nutrition goals. The poor weight gain outcome of these infants after PN is related to insufficient parenteral macronutrient and energy intakes.

However, the high dimensionality of the collected data from these applications has the largest influence on the quality of the HAR model. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient HAR system using a lightweight feature selection (FS) method to enhance the HAR classification process. The developed FS method, called GBOGWO, aims to improve the performance of the Gradient-based optimizer (GBO) algorithm by using the operators of the grey wolf optimizer (GWO). First, GBOGWO is used to select the appropriate features; then, the support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify the activities. To assess the performance of GBOGWO, extensive experiments using well-known UCI-HAR and WISDM datasets were conducted. Overall outcomes show that GBOGWO improved the classification accuracy with an average accuracy of 98%.","Helmi, Ahmed Mohamed; Al-qaness, Mohammed A.

This paper proposes design rules for register shifts in βαβ-motifs, which have not been reported previously, but are necessary for determining a target structure of de novo design of αβ-proteins. By analyzing naturally occurring protein structures in a database, we found preferences for register shifts in βαβ-motifs, and derived the following empirical rules: (1) register shifts must not be negative regardless of torsion types for a constituent loop in βαβ-motifs; (2) preferred register shifts strongly depend on the loop torsion types. To explain these empirical rules by physical interactions, we conducted physics-based simulations for systems mimicking a βαβ-motif that contains the most frequently observed loop type in the database. We performed an exhaustive conformational sampling of the loop region, imposing the exclusion volume and hydrogen bond satisfaction condition. The distributions of register shifts obtained from the simulations agreed well with those of the database analysis, indicating that the empirical rules are a consequence of physical interactions, rather than an evolutionary sampling bias. Our proposed design rules will serve as a guide to making appropriate target structures for the de novo design of αβ-proteins.","Murata, Hiroto; Imakawa, Hayao; Koga, Nobuyasu; Chikenji, George",PLoS One,103,1

The main treatment for NSCLC is based on Western medicine; however, the overall effect is unsatisfactory. This study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic targets and pharmacological mechanisms of action of the traditional Chinese medicine Corydalis decumbens (Thunb.) Pers. in NSCLC based on network pharmacology and bioinformatics. The overlapping genes between Corydalis decumbens (Thunb.) Pers. and NSCLCs were screened using Venn analysis. Cytoscape 3.7.1 software was used to analyze the overlapping target protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomics database were performed to exploring biological functions of the overlapping genes. The gene expression profiling interactive analysis dataset was used to analyze the correlation between hub gene expression and disease. This study revealed 38 nodes with 191 edges, which may be therapeutic targets for NSCLC. PPI network analysis showed that the most likely association was between the genes AR and NCOA2, NCOA2, and RXRA and ESR1 and NCOA2. These overlapping genes were mainly enriched in the estrogen signaling pathway, calcium signaling pathway, cholinergic synapse, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. ESR2 mRNA levels were signiﬁcantly downregulated in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) getting worse, and KDR levels were lower in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) than those in normal tissue. PTGS2 expression was correlated with the median survival time of LUAD, and ESR1 expression was correlated with the median survival time of LUSC. The application of network pharmacology revealed the potential mechanism underlying the effects of Corydalis decumbens (Thunb.) Pers. in NSCLC treatment and provided a theoretical basis for further in-depth research in this field.","Liu, Jun; He, Zhibo; Li, Shan; Huang, Wenan; Ren, Zhongjie",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,103,7

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of A. hierochuntica ethanolic (KEE), and aqueous (KAE) extracts on CCl(4)-induced oxidative stress and nephrotoxicity in rats using the biochemical markers for renal functions and antioxidant status as well as histopathological examinations of kidney tissue. A. hierochuntica contained 67.49 mg GAE g(−1) of total phenolic compounds (TPC), 3.51 µg g(−1) of total carotenoids (TC), and 49.78 and 17.45 mg QE g(−1) of total flavonoids (TF) and total flavonols (TFL), respectively. It resulted in 128.71 µmol of TE g(−1) of DPPH-RSA and 141.92 µmol of TE g(−1) of ABTS-RSA. A. hierochuntica presented superior antioxidant activity by inhibiting linoleic acid radicals and chelating oxidation metals. The HPLC analysis resulted in 9 and 21 phenolic acids and 6 and 2 flavonoids in KEE and KAE with a predominance of sinapic and syringic acids, respectively. Intramuscular injection of vit. E + Se and oral administration of KEE, KAE, and KEE + KAE at 250 mg kg(−1) body weight significantly restored serum creatinine, urea, K, total protein, and albumin levels. Additionally, they reduced malondialdehyde (MOD), restored reduced-glutathione (GSH), and enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. KEE, KAE, and KEE + KAE protected the kidneys from CCl(4)-nephrotoxicity as they mainly attenuated induced oxidative stress. Total nephroprotection was about 83.27%, 97.62%, and 78.85% for KEE, KAE, and KEE + KAE, respectively. Both vit. E + Se and A. hierochuntica extracts attenuated the histopathological alteration in CCl(4)-treated rats. In conclusion, A. hierochuntica, especially KAE, has the potential capability to restore oxidative stability and improve kidney function after CCl(4) acute kidney injury better than KEE. Therefore, A. hierochuntica has the potential to be a useful therapeutic agent in the treatment of drug-induced nephrotoxicity.","Almundarij, Tariq I.; Alharbi, Yousef M.; Abdel-Rahman, Hassan A.; Barakat, Hassan",Nutrients,103,1

As the traditional detection method based on the thread’s tension has the disadvantages of high cost and low reliability, this paper proposes a technology that installs a camera on a mobile robot and uses computer vision to detect the thread roll‘s margin. Before starting, we define a thread roll‘s margin as follows: The difference between the thread roll‘s radius and the bobbin’s radius. Firstly, we capture images of the thread roll‘s end surface. Secondly, we obtain the bobbin’s image coordinates by calculating the image’s convolutions with a Circle Gradient Operator. Thirdly, we fit the thread roll and bobbin’s contours into ellipses, and then delete false detections according to the bobbin’s image coordinates. Finally, we restore every sub-image of the thread roll by a perspective transformation method, and establish the conversion relationship between the actual size and pixel size. The difference value of the two concentric circles’ radii is the thread roll’s margin. However, there are false detections and these errors may be more than 19.4 mm when the margin is small. In order to improve the precision and delete false detections, we use deep learning to detect thread roll and bobbin’s radii and then can calculate the thread roll’s margin. After that, we fuse the two results. However, the deep learning method also has some false detections. As such, in order to eliminate the false detections completely, we estimate the thread roll‘s margin according to thread consumption speed. Lastly, we use a Kalman Filter to fuse the measured value and estimated value; the average error is less than 5.7 mm.","Shi, Zhiwei; Shi, Weimin; Wang, Junru",Sensors (Basel),103,1

Its spatial and temporal distribution is found ubiquitous. Though the sponges have simple morphology and anatomy, they show symbiotic association with several microorganisms, which are the main source of secondary metabolites and are capable of producing many biologically active compounds. So there is a good debate going on among the researchers that the source of such biologically active compounds/substances is either the sponge itself or the microorganism residing in the sponges. But unfortunately most of these symbiotic microorganisms are non-culturable. Anyhow the sponges as a whole are the good source of several substances covering the polyketides, alkaloids, terpenes, etc. This chapter deals with the variety of such chemical substances present in the sponges and their biological activities.","Shanmugam, A.; Vairamani, S.",Marine Sponges: Chemicobiological and Biomedical Applications,103,12

These three female travelers had stayed at the Metropole Hotel on the same floor as a Chinese physician later diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Hsu et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003). After returning to Singapore, one of the travelers (index A) who developed fever on February 25 was hospitalized at Tan Tock Seng Hospital on March 1, and was managed initially for straightforward community-acquired pneumonia. The other two travelers were also admitted with similar symptoms. Shortly thereafter, clusters of cases emerged in three separate wards, all traceable to the first imported case. By the time index A was isolated on March 6, she had already infected 22 persons, comprising ten health care workers, two inpatients, seven visitors, and three family members. One of the infected health care workers (index case B), with onset of symptoms on March 7 and a provisional diagnosis of dengue fever, was later admitted on March 10 to Ward 8A. At the ward she in turn infected 21 persons, including an inpatient with ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus, before she was isolated on March 13 (Wilder-Smith et al., 2004b). The inpatient (index case C) had been admitted on March 10 with fever, community-acquired pneumonia, and gramnegative bacteremia. When she developed heart failure on March 12, she was transferred to Ward 6A (the coronary care unit) and mechanically ventilated. However, she was isolated only on March 20 when SARS was suspected. By that time, 21 health care workers and 5 family members had become infected (Wilder- Smith et al., 2004b). A total of 109 cases were epidemiologically linked to index A. Intra-hospital transmission at Tan Tock Seng Hospital was interrupted by April 12, the date of onset of the hospital’s last case.

It provides a review of Taiwan’s bidding strategies for the World Health Organization between 1997 and 2009. The country’s participation in the World Health Assembly (WHA) and the International Health Regulations (IHR) network since 2009 was a significant improvement, but this experience failed to extend to other governing bodies. The chapter goes on to discuss the global public health risk of excluding Taiwan from cross-national health cooperation, and why such a conundrum remains difficult to resolve. Taiwan’s compliance regarding health governance relies heavily on self-regulation and the help of its allies. The United States has played a key role in enforcing global health regulations on Taiwan. Unlike other sources of threat in health governance, Taiwan currently does not represent a high health risk to other countries. As a result, Taiwan finds it difficult to persuade WHO members to manifest “universal participation” by including Taiwan in various intergovernmental health networks. This pattern of governance, however, lacks transparency. Other countries will find it difficult to monitor or intervene in the event Taiwan’s health authority is unable to deal with a transnational health emergency.","Chen, Ping-Kuei",Asia-Pacific Security Challenges,103,8

By obtaining a focused clinical history from the patient, they can identify patients who need to be referred to their physician or to the emergency room, as well as which patients can be managed at home. Red flags that prompt referral include severe systemic illness, respiratory distress, hemoptysis, and altered level of consciousness. Patients with underlying chronic illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and heart failure who present with cough should be assessed for possible exacerbation of their illness and should be referred if this is suspected. Determining the duration of cough is an important step, as this helps identify possible etiologies. Cough <3-week duration is categorized as acute, 3- to 8-week duration is subacute, and > 8-week duration is a chronic cough. Patients with cough lasting >3 weeks should generally be referred for further evaluation and management. Acute cough is often infectious but can also be due to exacerbation of underlying illness or could be medication-related. Upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) is one of the most common causes of subacute and chronic cough. Several different etiologies lead to UACS, which is thought to be caused by postnasal drip ± sensitization of cough receptors in the respiratory tract. First-generation antihistamines or decongestants are therapeutic options when UACS is suspected. It is important to note that antitussive medications such as dextromethorphan can actually prolong illness in patients with a productive cough and are thus not recommended. Monitoring parameters and frequency of follow-up depend on underlying cause, severity of illnesses, past medical history, as well as medication changes.","Glashan, Elizabeth; Mahmoud, Sherif Hanafy",Patient Assessment in Clinical Pharmacy,103,17

The infection of plants by Agrobacterium rhizogenes results in a hairy root (HR) phenotype characterized by rapid growth in hormone-free medium, an unusual ageotropism and extensive lateral branching. These genetically transformed root cultures (hairy roots) can produce levels of secondary metabolites comparable to that of intact plants. Hairy root cultures offer promise for high production and productivity of valuable secondary metabolites in many plants. High stability and productivity features allow the exploitation of HRs as valuable biotechnological tool for the production of plant secondary metabolites. While these chemical compounds are employed by plants for interactions with their environment, humans have long since explored and exploited plant secondary metabolites for medicinal and practical uses. The main constraint for commercial exploitation of hairy root cultivations is the development and scaling up of appropriate reactor vessels (bioreactors) that permit the growth of interconnected tissues normally unevenly distributed throughout the vessel. Emphasis has focused on designing appropriate bioreactors suitable to culture the delicate and sensitive plant hairy roots. To this end, hairy root culture presents an excellent platform for producing valuable secondary metabolites.

This led to the assumption that infectious disease has been defeated by medicine. In 1969 the United States Surgeon General actually claimed that “we can close the book on infectious diseases”. However, today we know that this assumption was naïve, not taking into account that evolution is a constant motor in adapting the existing organisms to changing environmental conditions, including the adaptation of pathogens to changes in the host. Today nearly 25% of the annual deaths world-wide are directly related to pathogens (Morens et al. 2004). This can be attributed to the appearance of new diseases, like HIV, SARS or West Nile Virus, but also to an increase of resistance to antibiotics in pathogens thought to be defeated, like Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Staphylococcus and Enterococcus strains. In addition the progress in medical care results in a large proportion of immune-deficient patients and consequently in an increase in opportunistic infections. Especially fungi have gained an infamous reputation during recent decades as being highly detrimental to patients with haematologiconcologic diseases, neutropenia or after organ transplantation. A review of the current literature identified 1415 species as known to be pathogenic to humans, including 538 bacteria and 307 fungi (Cleaveland et al. 2001). The fungi are a large group of diverse eukaryotic organisms. Only about 74 000 to 120 000 of the estimated 1.5×10(6) existing species of fungi have been described. Of the approximately 300 fungal species that are known to cause human infections, the most commonly observed live threatening systemic infections are caused by opportunistic infections of Candida species or Aspergilli. Therefore the major scientific interest with regard to fungal pathomechanisms has focused on these organisms in the past decade. The early availability of the genome sequence of Candida albicans (the first assembly of the genome sequence was publicly available in 2000, at http://www-sequence.stanford.edu/group/candida),the availability of molecular tools and the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model for many characteristics of C. albicans relevant for pathogenesis (including morphogenesis and signalling pathways involved in stress response) resulted in a major body of work concerning this opportunistic fungal pathogen (Berman and Sudbery 2002; Braun et al. 2005; Jones et al. 2004). Until 2004 C. albicans was actually the only fungal pathogen on which genome-wide transcriptomics using arrays had been published. The sequences of other pathogenic fungi or the tools required for genome-wide transcriptomics had not been available to the public until then. However, a major body of molecular work has been performed on other opportunistic fungal pathogens, including C. glabrata, C. parapsylosis, C. tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus species, where Aspergillus fumigatus is leading the clinically relevant species, as well as on the genera of primary fungal pathogens, including Blastomyces, Coccidioides, Histoplasma and Paracoccidioides. Due to the advancement of Candida albicans transcriptomics this chapter mainly focuses on this organism and only briefly touches the current work on other fungal pathogens.","Rupp, Steffen",Human and Animal Relationships,103,1

She became interested in service development for airlines while employed as a member of the cabin crew by an airline (here called H), which while based in Europe flies to Japan. Based on that experience combined with subsequent fieldwork, the research reported here explores changes in the culture of cabin service, paying particular attention to the personal agency exercised by a subset of cabin crew members who are Regional Flight Attendants responsible for providing local language and culturally sensitive service to passengers from their homelands, as they have responded to a changing airline industry environment. Today’s airlines are deeply embedded in the global circulation of people, goods, and capital. They have also been primary actors in promoting changes in their own global culture. As the process of creating a global “airline civilization” has unfolded, they have been forced repeatedly to restructure their organizations in response to changes in their business environment. These changes have strongly influenced both the nature of cabin service and the working conditions of cabin crew members. On the one hand, their jobs have become more demanding. On the other, they have, through service design, maintained a certain distance from their work and continue to enjoy the freedom it offers. They face increasingly stiff demands but remain grateful to the airline for providing the opportunities they enjoy.","Yamaki, Keiko",Enterprise as an Instrument of Civilization,103,5

However, few studies have investigated the circulation of clade 2.3.4.4c viruses after 2015. Here, we describe Gs/GD clade 2.3.4.4c and Mexican-like H5N2 viruses that were isolated in Taiwan during active surveillance conducted in chicken farms from February to March 2019. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated two distinct genome constellations of the clade 2.3.4.4c H5 viruses, with the internal genes of one of the new genotypes closely related to a virus isolated from a pintail (Anas acuta) in Taiwan, providing the first direct evidence that migratory birds play a role in importing viruses into Taiwan. Our study also confirmed the co-circulation of Gs/GD clade 2.3.4.4c and Mexican-like H5 lineage viruses in Taiwan, presenting a rare case where Gs/GD viruses developed sustained transmission alongside another enzootic H5 lineage, raising the possibility that homosubtypic immunity may mask virus transmission, potentially frustrating detection, and the implementation of appropriate control measures. To eradicate H5 viruses from poultry in Taiwan, further studies on the effect of co-circulation in poultry of low pathogenic avian influenza and HPAI viruses are needed. Furthermore, only with continued surveillance efforts globally can we fully discern dispersal patterns and risk factors of virus transmission both to and within Taiwan.","Li, Yao-Tsun; Chen, Chen-Chih; Chang, Ai-Mei; Chao, Day-Yu; Smith, Gavin J D",Virus Evol,103,0

These included the establishment of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) as a national human rights institution, Ministry of Women’s Affairs, Departments of Women’s Affairs and Gender, Human Rights Units in various ministries and the passing of the Law on Elimination of Violence against Women (EVAW Law) through a Presidential Decree in 2009. Afghanistan is a signatory to several international human rights instruments, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). International treaties and Conventions to which Afghanistan is a signatory forbid all types of discrimination against girls and women and oblige Afghanistan to eliminate all types of discrimination, violence and other possible detrimental practices against women. This paper aims to critically analyse the international obligations of Afghanistan concerning violence against women and the necessary legal and institutional amendments for providing better protection for such victims. This paper has pursued a reformist agenda to eliminate violence against women, which is largely caused by weaknesses in Afghanistan’s legal, institutional and policy frameworks regarding women. The existing legal environment in Afghanistan comprises three incoherent sources of law—State legal code, customary practices and Islamic sharia law. Adopting and implementing the recommendations are likely to contribute significantly to the emancipation of women in Afghanistan. Thus, as part of the reformist agenda adopted by this paper, violence against women warrants urgent legal, institutional and policy reforms.","Qazi Zada, Sebghatullah",Indian Journal of International Law,103,0

In this work, different SLNs were developed, by combination of cationic and ionizable lipids, for delivery of mRNA and pDNA. The influence of formulation factors on transfection efficacy, protein expression and intracellular disposition of the nucleic acid was evaluated in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19) and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293). A long-term stability study of the vectors was also performed. The mRNA formulations induced a higher percentage of transfected cells than those containing pDNA, mainly in ARPE-19 cells; however, the pDNA formulations induced a greater protein production per cell in this cell line. Protein production was conditioned by energy-dependent or independent entry mechanisms, depending on the cell line, SLN composition and kind of nucleic acid delivered. Vectors containing 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) as unique cationic lipid showed better stability after seven months, which improved with the addition of a polysaccharide to the vectors. Transfection efficacy and long-term stability of mRNA vectors were more influenced by formulation-related factors than those containing pDNA; in particular, the SLNs containing only DOTAP were the most promising formulations for nucleic acid delivery.","Gómez-Aguado, Itziar; Rodríguez-Castejón, Julen; Vicente-Pascual, Mónica; Rodríguez-Gascón, Alicia; del Pozo-Rodríguez, Ana; Solinís Aspiazu, María Ángeles",Molecules,103,1

A vast majority of these tests detect only SARS-CoV-2 which causes symptoms similar to those caused by other respiratory pathogens. Hence, other etiologies or co-infections requiring a different therapy may be missed. The prototype BioFire® Respiratory Panel 2.1 (RP2.1) continues the syndromic approach of the FDA-cleared BioFire® Respiratory Panel 2 (RP2), to provide the ability to simultaneously detect 22 common respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, from nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens. The goal of this study was to rapidly develop a RP2.1 prototype that contains high-performing SARS-CoV-2 assays and maintains the performance of assays retained from RP2. METHODS: Twelve assays designed for four SARS-CoV-2 genes were tested for compatibility with the RP2 assays and conditions. All retained RP2 assays were evaluated to verify established RP2 performance. The sensitivity of novel SARS-CoV-2 assays was estimated with nucleic acids at BioFire and contrived live virus NPS samples at MRIGlobal. Primer homology of SARS-CoV-2 assays to > 15,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from accessible databases was assessed for in silico inclusivity RESULTS: A prototype multiplexed PCR panel containing assays for 22 pathogens was developed in a 5-week period. Of the 12 SARS-CoV-2 assays, 7 were compatible with the RP2 conditions; 2 were selected for the prototype. No false positive results due to cross-reactivity with unintended analytes or non-specific amplification in negative samples were observed for any assays. All retained RP2 assays were detected at or near their established LoD. The SARS-CoV-2 LoD was estimated at 10(3) -10(2) genomes/mL with both nucleic acid and live virus spiked into NPS. Together, the assays are 100% inclusive for all 15,370 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes assessed in silico for reactivity. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate a strong potential for RP2.1 to serve as a sensitive comprehensive syndromic option to aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19 as well as respiratory syndromes caused by other pathogens, including co-infections. This study was performed with a test not cleared for diagnostic use.

The training of such networks involves carefully trading off entropy of the latent representation against reconstruction quality. The term quality crucially depends on the observer of the images which, in the vast majority of literature, is assumed to be human. In this paper, we aim to go beyond this notion of compression quality and look at human visual perception and image classification simultaneously. To that end, we use a family of loss functions that allows to optimize deep image compression depending on the observer and to interpolate between human perceived visual quality and classification accuracy, enabling a more unified view on image compression. Our extensive experiments show that using perceptual loss functions to train a compression system preserves classification accuracy much better than traditional codecs such as BPG without requiring retraining of classifiers on compressed images. For example, compressing ImageNet to 0.25 bpp reduces Inception-ResNet classification accuracy by only 2%. At the same time, when using a human friendly loss function, the same compression system achieves competitive performance in terms of MS-SSIM. By combining these two objective functions, we show that there is a pronounced trade-off in compression quality between the human visual system and classification accuracy.

This posed significant and specific challenges to hands‐on, practical‐based subjects. In this paper, we evaluated the effectiveness of delivering a 2(nd)year physiology practical subject in a fully‐online environment. The subject consisted of a weekly 1 hr lecture, and 3 hour Zoom workshop, where the students worked in breakout rooms in small groups of 4‐6. Videos of the practical experiments, together with the experimental recordings and additional data, were deployed through the Learning Management System, Canvas. The student could analysis the recordings using Biopac Student Laboratory and GraphPad Prism which provide autonomy to the students during classes online and offline. The student groups collaborated synchronously, and asynchronously, through the online electronic notebook, LabArchives. To promote further collaborative work across the whole class, we utilised an online discussion board (Edstem.org), and Padlet for co‐operation between students. The integration of this suite of online tools and offline software provided students with autonomy while facilitating and promoting teamwork in the online learning environment. At the end of the semester, students were surveyed on their perception of different aspects of the subject using Qualtrics on a 5 point‐Likert scale. The completion of the survey was voluntary. Responses ranked either Agree or Strongly Agree were grouped as positive responses. From the 40 responses received, the impact of transition to online practical classes was clearly mixed for students with an even distribution across responses. While 35% of respondents found it difficult to adjust to online learning, and only 45% of the students found online practicals classes in Zoom breakout rooms to be an engaging learning space, 60% still enjoyed the weekly practical classes. This difference is likely due to the positive effect of working with the same group throughout the semester (85% positive responses) and the majority of students (97%) found their team to be cohesive throughout the semester. The breakout rooms were also viewed as an important part of the subject, with the inclusion of webcam videos in the breakout rooms to be important for team cohesion (93% positive responses). Majority of students found the videos of the experiments useful and important to understand the procedures (90%), and most felt that the videos were essential for the online practicals (71%). Nearly all the students (94%) reported to have watched the videos, and interestingly, 60 preferred to watch the videos with their teams in the breakout rooms during the Zoom sessions. Despite some challenges with LabArchives, 62% of students found LabArchives to be an effective collaboration tool for online practical classes. In addition, 65% of students reported that they regularly used the online discussion board to aid their learning, and more than half (55%) prefer a subject wide discussion board, than private forums. In conclusion, the experience of online practical learning is challenging to some students. The results of this study indicate factors such as instructional videos, working with the same team and online collaborative tools can improve the student experience for online practical learning.","Fong, Angelina; Hammond, Andrew",FASEB J,103,1

For analysis of the microbiome, workflows typically begin with taxonomic classification of the microorganisms that are present in a given environment. Additional investigation is then required to uncover the functionality of the microbial community, in order to characterize its currently or potentially active biological processes. Such functional analysis of metagenomic data can be computationally demanding for high-throughput sequencing experiments. Instead, we can directly compare sequencing reads to a functionally annotated database. However, since reads frequently match multiple sequences equally well, analyses benefit from a hierarchical annotation tree, e.g. for taxonomic classification where reads are assigned to the lowest taxonomic unit. RESULTS To facilitate functional microbiome analysis, we re-purpose well-known taxonomic classification tools to allow us to perform direct functional sequencing read classification with the added benefit of a functional hierarchy. To enable this, we develop and present a tree-shaped functional hierarchy representing the molecular function subset of the Gene Ontology annotation structure. We use this functional hierarchy to replace the standard phylogenetic taxonomy used by the classification tools and assign query sequences accurately to the lowest possible molecular function in the tree. We demonstrate this with simulated and experimental datasets, where we reveal new biological insights. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrate that improved functional classification of metagenomic sequencing reads is possible by re-purposing a range of taxonomic classification tools that are already well-established, in conjunction with either protein or nucleotide reference databases. We leverage the advances in speed, accuracy and efficiency that have been made for taxonomic classification and translate these benefits for the rapid functional classification of microbiomes. While we focus on a specific set of commonly used methods, the functional annotation approach has broad applicability across other sequence classification tools.

Macrophages are a key innate immune cell population responsible for the cytokine storm that has been shown, in T2D, to promote excess inflammation in response to infection. Using peripheral monocytes and sera from human patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and a murine hepatitis coronavirus (MHV-A59) (an established murine model of SARS), we identified that coronavirus induces an increased Mφ-mediated inflammatory response due to a coronavirus-induced decrease in the histone methyltransferase, SETDB2. This decrease in SETDB2 upon coronavirus infection results in a decrease of the repressive trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) at NFkB binding sites on inflammatory gene promoters, effectively increasing inflammation. Mφs isolated from mice with a myeloid-specific deletion of SETDB2 displayed increased pathologic inflammation following coronavirus infection. Further, IFNβ directly regulates SETDB2 in Mφs via JaK1/STAT3 signaling, as blockade of this pathway altered SETDB2 and the inflammatory response to coronavirus infection. Importantly, we also found that loss of SETDB2 mediates an increased inflammatory response in diabetic Mϕs in response to coronavirus infection. Treatment of coronavirus-infected diabetic Mφs with IFNβ reversed the inflammatory cytokine production via up-regulation of SETDB2/H3K9me3 on inflammatory gene promoters. Together, these results describe a potential mechanism for the increased Mφ-mediated cytokine storm in patients with T2D in response to COVID-19 and suggest that therapeutic targeting of the IFNβ/SETDB2 axis in T2D patients may decrease pathologic inflammation associated with COVID-19.","Melvin, William J; Audu, Christopher O; Davis, Frank M; Sharma, Sriganesh B; Joshi, Amrita; DenDekker, Aaron; Wolf, Sonya; Barrett, Emily; Mangum, Kevin; Zhou, Xiaofeng; Bame, Monica; Ruan, Alex; Obi, Andrea; Kunkel, Steven L; Moore, Bethany B; Gallagher, Katherine A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,103,16

Treatment of homologous recombination deficient (HRD)-tumors with PARP inhibitors generates significant levels of DNA damage, which has the potential to further increasing tumor mutational burden, promoting neoantigen release, and upregulating both interferons and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression, suggesting a potential complementary and synergistic role with immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer treatment. Here we present the design and rationale of a prospective, phase II, single-arm study aiming to investigate the safety and antitumor activity of the combination of niraparib and dostarlimab in patients with HRD-positive and PD-L1 ≥ 1% advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and/or malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Considering the prevalence of pathogenetic germline mutations in DNA repair genes, reported to be around 5% to 10% in patients with MPM and NSCLC, a total of 700 to 1000 cases will be screened to identify 70 patients who are HRD-positive/PD-L1 ≥ 1% (N = 35 NSCLC; N = 35 MPM) to be included. Patients will receive the combination of niraparib orally once daily and dostarlimab intravenously. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints are objective response, duration of response, overall survival, and safety. The results of this study will provide evidence on the safety and antitumor activity of niraparib and dostarlimab combination in patients with advanced, HRD-positive and PD-L1 ≥ 1% NSCLC and/or MPM.","Passiglia, Francesco; Bironzo, Paolo; Righi, Luisella; Listì, Angela; Arizio, Francesca; Novello, Silvia; Volante, Marco; Scagliotti, Giorgio Vittorio",Clinical lung cancer,103,31

METHODS A prospective cohort study enrolled 108 patients with Rutherford category 2-3 ischemia who had successful primary unilateral angioplasty and self-expanding bare metal stent implantation for superficial femoral artery (SFA) stenosis. The primary endpoint was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke or transient ischemic attack, cardiovascular death, or >80% target lesion restenosis within 2 years after peripheral angioplasty. Target lesion restenosis (restenosis endpoint) and the composite of the aforementioned atherothrombotic events (atherothrombotic endpoint) within 2-year follow-up were defined as secondary endpoints. RESULTS CHE levels were not available in 4 patients due to technical problems and 4 patients were lost to follow-up. The remaining 100 patients (median age 65 years; 62 men) met the minimum sample size requirement for statistical analysis. Median CHE levels were significantly lower in patients who subsequently experienced the primary endpoint compared with patients without ischemic events [7.1 (IQR 6.3-8.1) vs 8 (IQR 7-9.3) kU/L, p=0.007]. A CHE level <8.3 kU/L was identified as the best cutoff value to predict the primary endpoint, providing an 82.1% sensitivity and 44.3% specificity. The primary endpoint occurred significantly more often in patients with low CHE <8.3 kU/L than in patients with higher CHE levels (32 vs 7 patients, p=0.01). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, low CHE was associated with a 2.6-fold increased risk (95% CI 1.1 to 5.9, p=0.03) of the primary endpoint. Moreover, patients who suffered the secondary restenosis endpoint had significantly lower median CHE levels than patients without restenosis [7.1 (IQR 6.3-8.2) vs 7.9 (IQR 7-8.9) kU/L, p=0.02], and restenosis occurred more frequently in patients with low CHE compared with those with higher CHE levels (27 vs 7 patients, p=0.04). CONCLUSION Low CHE is associated with an increased risk of long-term adverse ischemic events following SFA angioplasty with stent implantation for PAD.","Gremmel, Thomas; Wadowski, Patricia P; Mueller, Markus; Kopp, Christoph W; Koppensteiner, Renate; Panzer, Simon",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,103,1

In Condition B, which consisted of 12 instead of 7 180° familiarization trials, the 4-month-olds looked significantly longer at the 112° test events than the 180° test events; there was a novelty preference. In Condition C, which was similar to Condition A except that there were 112° familiarization trials, the infants showed a familiarity preference. Thus, 4-month-olds experiencing 7 familiarization trials exhibited a familiarity preference, and those experiencing 12 familiarization trials showed a novelty preference. In Condition D, 6-month-olds experienced 7 180° familiarization trials; there was no preferential looking to either familiar (180°) test events or novel (112°) test events. Therefore, looking behavior during the test trials was a function of the type of familiarization experience and age and not necessarily an inferred violation of physics.","Schilling, Thomas H",Infancy : the official journal of the International Society on Infant Studies,103,12

Decapod crabs have transitioned from marine to terrestrial environments at least ten times, occupy diverse habitats, and display varying degrees of terrestriality. Previous attempts to categorize land crab diversity relied on single traits, did not explicitly distinguish between brachyuran and anomuran lineages, and did not separate lineages that colonized land via freshwater or marine environments. As a result, critical phylogenetic and ecological constraints were missing from these earlier classifications. In this paper, I reclassify terrestriality in the land crabs by designating four transition pathways that reflect deep phylogenetic relationships between the two decapod crab infraorders and the route-specific nature of this transition. I then describe the adaptive traits that evolved in response to six primary terrestrial selective challenges. I conclude by proposing six grades of terrestriality in this system that describe observable trait-by-environment associations, and propose studies that can test the hypothetical sequence of trait evolution and the nature of convergence in the land crabs using phylogenomic and transcriptomic tools.","Watson-Zink, Victoria M",Arthropod structure & development,103,24

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the most commonly performed procedure for VBG revision. So we aimed at reporting our experience in conversional RYGB for a failed VBG. MATERIAL AND METHODS Analyzing follow-up records of 102 patients who underwent revisional RYGB after failed VBG in the period from April 2014 to January 2018. RESULTS A total of 102 laparoscopic revisions of failed VBGs to RYGB were performed. The mean operating time was 161.9 min ±29.2 and the mean length of the hospital stay was 1.5 days ±1.2. Fourteen patients (13%) developed early post-operative complications (gastrojejunostomy leak 5; bleeding 9). Four patients (4.7%) developed late complications (Port site hernia 2; internal hernia 1; Stomal ulcer 1). The mean BMI pre-RYGB was 46.6 ± 5.9 kg/m2, and the mean %EBWL (percent excess body weight lost) of the patients at 12 and 24 months post-revision were 56.2% and 64.3%, respectively. Our patients had immediate post-revision resolution of VBG-related complications like dysphagia and vomiting. We also report improvement in all obesity-related health problems with (75.7%) complete remission rate and (24.3%) partial remission or improvement rate of diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION Conversion of VBG to RYGB is a feasible procedure and is associated with acceptable early morbidity rates and reduced lengths of hospitalization also it provides acceptable weight loss and improvement in obesity-related health problems.

Currently, there are no universal standards for this testing and methods vary greatly within the literature. A scoping review of relevant studies was undertaken to analyse the methodologies used for in vivo mesh testing. METHODS Medline and Embase databases were searched for relevant studies. 513 articles were identified and 231 duplicates excluded. 126 papers were included after abstract and full text review. The data extraction was undertaken using standardised forms. RESULTS Mesh is most commonly tested in rats (53%). 78% of studies involve the formation of a defect; in 52% of which the fascia is not opposed. The most common hernia models use mesh to bridge an acute defect (50%). Tensile strength testing is the commonest form of mechanical testing (63%). Testing strip widths and test speeds vary greatly (4-30 mm and 1.625-240 mm/min, respectively). There is little consensus on which units to use for tensile strength testing. Collagen is assessed for its abundance (54 studies) more than its alignment (18 studies). Alignment is not measured quantitatively. At least 21 histological scoring systems are used for in vivo mesh testing. CONCLUSIONS The current practice of in vivo mesh testing lacks standardisation. There is significant inconsistency in every category of testing, both in methodology and comparators. We would call upon hernia organisations and materials testing institutions to discuss the need for a standardised approach to this field.","Whitehead-Clarke, T; Karanjia, R; Banks, J; Beynon, V; Parker, S; Sanders, D; Mudera, V; Windsor, A; Kureshi, A",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,103,30

We found that these two cell types from both human and pig showed comparable susceptibilities to initial infection with a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus (A/turkey/Turkey/1/05) and a moderately pathogenic human influenza H1N1 virus (A/USSR/77), but there were contrasting differences in host innate immune responses. Human cells mounted vigorous cytokine (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) and chemokine (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11) responses to H5N1 virus infection. However, pig epithelial cells and macrophages showed weak or no TNF-α and chemokine induction with the same infections. The apparent lack of a strong proinflammatory response, corroborated by the absence of TNF-α induction in H5N1 virus-challenged pigs, coincided with greater cell death and the reduced release of infectious virus from infected pig epithelial cells. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), a protein suppressor of the JAK-STAT pathway, was constitutively highly expressed and transcriptionally upregulated in H5N1 virus-infected pig epithelial cells and macrophages, in contrast to the corresponding human cells. The overexpression of SOCS3 in infected human macrophages dampened TNF-α induction. In summary, we found that the reported low susceptibility of pigs to contemporary Eurasian HPAI H5N1 virus infections coincides at the level of innate immunity of respiratory epithelial cells and macrophages with a reduced output of viable virus and an attenuated proinflammatory response, possibly mediated in part by SOCS3, which could serve as a target in the treatment or prevention of virus-induced hypercytokinemia, as observed for humans.","Nelli, Rahul K; Dunham, Stephen P; Kuchipudi, Suresh V; White, Gavin A; Baquero-Perez, Belinda; Chang, Pengxiang; Ghaemmaghami, Amir; Brookes, Sharon M; Brown, Ian H; Chang, Kin-Chow",Journal of virology,103,1

METHODS This study is a prospective, nationwide study in patients with solid cancer and SARS-CoV-2 infection included between 10 March to 15 June 2020. Patient's baseline characteristics were collected. The study's primary outcome was overall survival within 30 days of verified SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondary outcomes were hospital admission, admission to an ICU, and need for supplemental oxygen. RESULTS A total of 112 patients with a cancer diagnosis and verified SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified. After one month of follow up, hospitalization was required for 54% (n = 61) and 21% of the patients had died and 14 of the 23 deceased cancer patients were ≥70 years. Most patients were classified with mild COVID-19 symptoms (66%, n = 74); however, 48% (n = 23) of the ≥70-year-olds patients were classified with severe or critical COVID-19 symptoms.

METHODS Three prospectively followed cases are described, and all 30 previously published minimally invasive cases of fetal therapy for hydropic lung masses are reviewed. RESULTS Three hydropic fetuses with large intrathoracic lung masses presented at 17, 25 and 21 weeks of gestation, respectively. An aortic feeding vessel was identified in each case and thus a bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS) was suspected. Under ultrasound guidance, the feeding vessel was successfully occluded with interstitial laser (Case 1), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) (Case 2) and thrombogenic coil embolization (Case 3). Complete (Cases 1 and 2) or partial (Case 3) resolution of the lung mass and hydrops was observed. A healthy infant was born at term after laser therapy (Case 1), and the involved lung lobe was resected on day 2 of postnatal life. In Case 2, hydrops resolved completely following RFA, but an iatrogenic congenital diaphragmatic hernia and abdominal wall defect became apparent 4 weeks later. The neonate died from sepsis following spontaneous preterm labor at 33 weeks. In Case 3, despite technical success in complete vascular occlusion with coils, a stillbirth ensued 2 days after embolization. CONCLUSIONS The prognosis of large microcystic or echogenic fetal chest masses associated with hydrops is dismal. This has prompted attempts at treatment by open fetal surgery, with mixed results, high risk of premature labor and consequences for future pregnancies. We have demonstrated the possibility of improved outcome following ultrasound-guided laser ablation of the systemic arterial supply. Despite technical success, RFA and coil embolization led to procedure-related complications and need further evaluation.","Baud, D; Windrim, R; Kachura, J R; Jefferies, A; Pantazi, S; Shah, P; Langer, J C; Forsey, J; Chaturvedi, R R; Jaeggi, E; Keating, S; Chiu, P; Ryan, G",Ultrasound in obstetrics & gynecology : the official journal of the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology,103,31

Using an exploratory approach, this study aimed to evaluate sex differences in neuromuscular responses and motor variability during a repetitive task performed on 3 days. METHODS Thirty women and 27 men performed the non-fatiguing, repetitive, 1-h screwing task. For neuromuscular responses, the mean and difference values of static, median, and peak percentile muscle activity levels (normalized to a reference voluntary contraction force) and, for motor variability, the mean and difference values of relative and absolute cycle-to-cycle variability across days were compared between both sexes for each muscle. A mixed-design analysis of variance was used to assess differences between both sexes. RESULTS The non-fatiguing character of the screwing task was confirmed by the absence of decreased force levels in maximal voluntary contractions performed before and after the task and by absence of electromyographic signs of muscle fatigue. The static and median muscle activity levels tended to be higher among women (on average 7.86 and 27.23 %RVE) than men (on average 6.04 and 26.66 %RVE). Relative motor variability of the flexor and biceps muscles and absolute motor variability of both upper arm muscles were lower in women (on average 0.79 and 29.70 %RVE) than in men (on average 0.89 and 37.55 %RVE). The median activity level of both upper arms muscles tended to decrease within days among women (on average - 2.63 %RVE) but increase among men (on average + 1.19 %RVE). Absolute motor variability decreased within days among women (on average - 5.32 to - 0.34%RVE), whereas it tended to decrease less or increase within days among men (on average - 1.21 to + 0.25 %RVE). CONCLUSION Women showed higher levels of muscle activity and lower initial relative and absolute motor variability than males when performing the same occupational task, implying women may have a higher risk for developing disorders and point to both sexes using different intrinsic motor control strategies in task performance.

An early assessment of illness severity is important for the stratification of patients. We analysed the predictive value of National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) for intensive care unit admission (ICU) in patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.Methods: Data of 71 patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted from 1 March to 20 April 2020, to the Clinic of Infectious Diseases of Perugia Hospital, Italy, were retrospectively reviewed. NEWS2 at hospital admission, demographic, comorbidity and clinical data were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to establish the correlation between each variable and ICU admission.Results: Among 68 patients included in the analysis, 27 were admitted to ICU. NEWS2 at hospital admission was a good predictor of ICU admission as shown by an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis of 0.90 (standard error 0.04; 95% confidence interval 0.82-0.97). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, NEWS2 was significantly related to ICU admission using thresholds of 5 and 7. No other clinical variables included in the model were significantly correlated with ICU admission.A NEWS2 threshold of 5 had higher sensitivity than a threshold of 7 (89% and 63%). Higher specificity, positive likelihood ratio and positive predictive value were found using a threshold of 7 than a threshold of 5.Conclusions: NEWS2 at hospital admission was a good predictor for ICU admission. Patients with severe COVID-19 were correctly and rapidly stratified.","Gidari, Anna; De Socio, Giuseppe Vittorio; Sabbatini, Samuele; Francisci, Daniela",Infectious diseases,103,7

This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of porcine dermal collagen (PDC) as a closing aid in giant hernias after OLT in a prospective trial. If direct closure (DC) was not feasible due to the hernia size and abdominal wall constitution, a PDC mesh was implanted. All patients from the PDC and DC groups were followed prospectively for 24 months. IH recurrence rates served as the primary endpoint, and the development of infections and wound healing disorders served as the secondary endpoints. Recurrence rate was 21% (4/19) in DC patients and 12% (2/16) in PDC patients (P = 0.045). Implant site infections occurred in five of PDC and one of DC patients (P < 0.05). All of them were managed with antibiotics; two of the PDC patients required surgical drainage. Histological analysis of PDC mesh biopsies indicated good angiogenesis and integration of the PDC into the abdominal wall. PDC was effective in our study for incisional hernia repair, and our results compared favourably with those of patients in whom direct hernia closure was feasible.","Werkgartner, Georg; Cerwenka, Herwig; Rappl, Thomas; Kniepeiss, Daniela; Kornprat, Peter; Iberer, Florian; Bacher, Heinz; Wagner, Mathias; Mischinger, Hans J; Wagner, Doris",Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation,103,12

The timing and utility of ultrasonographic features of HUS D+ were analyzed. The aim of the study was to determine factors that could aid in the early diagnosis of this disease. A total of 13 children with HUS D+ were identified out of 23 patients with HUS diagnosed during this time period. Evidence of Escherichia coli 0157:H7 was found in 9 cases (70%). Ultrasound studies were ordered in 10 patients (71%), all of which showed renal sonographic findings compatible with HUS. Ultrasound was performed at a mean of 13 days after onset of the diarrhea. Of note, 2 patients whose ultrasounds were performed at the beginning of their diarrheal illness manifested ultrasonographic features suggestive of HUS when there was only a mild increase in serum creatinine and no decrease in hemoglobin or platelets, suggesting that ultrasonography can identify renal involvement early in the course of the disease before other systemic signs appear. Early renal ultrasound may be a useful adjunct in the initial evaluation in children with bloody diarrhea. Evidence of increased renal echogenicity in a patient with bloody diarrhea could aid in early recognition of HUS when other diagnoses such as intussusceptions are being entertained, potentially allowing early intervention.","Glatstein, Miguel; Miller, Elka; Garcia-Bournissen, Facundo; Scolnik, Dennis",Clinical pediatrics,103,1

LANCET figured out that the 2019-nCoV is closely related to ""cytokine storm"". ""Cytokine storm"" is an excessive immune response of the body to external stimuli such as viruses and bacteria. As the virus attacking the body, it stimulates the secretion of a large number of inflammatory factors: interleukin(IL), interferon(IFN), C-X-C motif chemokine(CXCL) and so on, which lead to cytokine cascade reaction. With the exudation of inflammatory factors, cytokines increase abnormally in tissues and organs, interfering with the immune system, causing excessive immune response of the body, resulting in diffuse damage of lung cells, pulmonary fibrosis, and multiple organ damage, even death. Arachidonic acid(AA) metabolic pathway is principally used to synthesize inflammatory cytokines, such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1(MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor(TNF), IL, IFN, etc., which is closely related to the occurrence, development and regression of inflammation. Therefore, the inhibition of AA metabolism pathway is benefit for inhibiting the release of inflammatory factors in the body and alleviating the ""cytokine storm"". Based on the pharmacophore models of the targets on AA metabolic pathway, the traditional Chinese medicine database 2009(TCMD 2009) was screened. The potential herbs were ranked by the number of hit molecules, which were scored by pharmacophore fit value. In the end, we obtained the potential active prescriptions on ""cytokine storm"" according to the potential herbs in the ""National novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan(trial version sixth)"". The results showed that the hit components with the inhibitory effect on AA were magnolignan Ⅰ, lonicerin and physcion-8-O-β-D-glucopy-ranoside, which mostly extracted from Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Scutellariae Radix, Gardeniae Fructus, Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Arctii Fructus, Dryopteridis Crassirhizomatis Rhizoma, Paeoniaeradix Rubra, Dioscoreae Rhizoma.

There are limited data on the comparative performance of mechanical thrombectomy devices. This study aimed to analyse the efficacy and safety of the stent retriever device (Solitaire stent) by comparing procedure time, angiographic outcome, complication rate and long term clinical outcome with previous chemical thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy using penumbra system. METHODS A retrospective single-center analysis was undertaken of all consecutive patients who underwent chemical thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy using Penumbra or Solitaire stent retriever from March 2009 to March 2014. Baseline characteristics, rate of successful recanalization (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score 2b-3), symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, procedure time, mortality and independent functional outcomes (mRS ≤2) at 3 month were compared across the three method. RESULTS Our cohort included 164 patients, mechanical thrombectomy using stent retriever device had a significant impact on recanalization rate and functional independence at 3 months. In unadjusted analysis mechanical thrombectomy using Solitaire stent retriever showed higher recanalization rate than Penumbra system and chemical thrombolysis (75% vs. 64.2% vs. 49.4%, p=0.03) and higher rate of functional independence at 3 month (53.1% vs. 37.7% vs. 35.4%, p=0.213). In view of the interrelationships between all predictors of variables associated with a good clinical outcome, when the chemical thrombolysis was used as a reference, in multiple logistic regression analysis, the use of Solitaire stent retriever showed higher odds of independent functional outcome [odds ratio (OR) 2.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-7.17; p=0.061] in comparison with penumbra system (OR 1.57, 95% CI 0.63-3.90; p=0.331). CONCLUSION Our initial data suggest that mechanical thrombectomy using stent retriever is superior to the mechanical thrombectomy using penumbra system and conventional chemical thrombolysis in achieving higher rates of reperfusion and better outcomes. Randomized clinical trials are needed to establish the actual benefit to specific patient populations.","Choi, Jae-Hyung; Park, Hyun-Seok; Kim, Dae-Hyun; Cha, Jae-Kwan; Huh, Jae-Taeck; Kang, Myongjin",Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,103,1

While safe vaccines were developed, tested and approved at an extraordinary pace, concerns were raised regarding the public's response in accepting the vaccine on the population level. Israel was among the first countries to roll out a massive national campaign for COVID-19 vaccination, positioning Israel as the global lead in vaccine uptake. Priority for vaccination was given to high-risk groups: older and middle-age adults, healthcare workers, senior home residents and caregivers, people with chronic conditions, followed by teachers and soldiers. Contributing to the success of the operation thus far has been a systems approach beyond nationwide accessibility: building public trust through an integrated and familiar health system, a familiar technology (vaccine), transparency regarding vaccine safety information, culturally appropriate messages in digital and offline media, acknowledging diverse health literacy needs, and active participation and role-modeling by political/religious opinion leaders. Vaccine resistance and hesitancy may be encountered as the campaign progresses, and younger groups targeted.

The trials offer definite evidence that in acute ischemia recanalization is a powerful predictor of good outcome. However, even in the era of rapid and effective recanalization using endovascular approaches, the percentage of patients with good outcomes varies between 33 and 71 %. In addition, the number of patients who are eligible for endovascular thrombectomy is small and usually based on having salvageable tissue on imaging. There is therefore room for improvement to both enhance the effectiveness of current practice and expand treatment to a larger subset of stroke patients.

Detecting COVID-19 at early stage is essential to deliver proper healthcare to the patients and also to protect the uninfected population. To this end, we develop a dual-sampling attention network to automatically diagnose COVID-19 from the community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in chest computed tomography (CT). In particular, we propose a novel online attention module with a 3D convolutional network (CNN) to focus on the infection regions in lungs when making decisions of diagnoses. Note that there exists imbalanced distribution of the sizes of the infection regions between COVID-19 and CAP, partially due to fast progress of COVID-19 after symptom onset. Therefore, we develop a dual-sampling strategy to mitigate the imbalanced learning. Our method is evaluated (to our best knowledge) upon the largest multi-center CT data for COVID-19 from 8 hospitals. In the training-validation stage, we collect 2186 CT scans from 1588 patients for a 5-fold cross-validation.

Participants (n = 25) were adults, with overweight/obesity and elevated BP, and performed seated desk work for 7.5 h. BP and PWV were measured in seated and supine postures at baseline (7:15 a.m.), midday (12:05 p.m.), and afternoon (4:45 p.m.). Generalized linear mixed models evaluated the effects of prolonged sitting on BP and PWV within each posture and interactions by posture and sex. In the recommended postures, seated BP and supine carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and carotid-ankle pulse wave velocity (caPWV), but not carotid-radial pulse wave velocity (crPWV), significantly increased over the simulated seated workday (all p < 0.05; effect sizes [d] ranged from 0.25 to 0.44). Whilst no posture-by-time interactions were observed (p > 0.05), BP, caPWV, and crPWV were higher when seated versus supine (main effects of posture p < 0.05; d ranged from 0.30 to 1.04). Exploratory analysis revealed that females had greater seated BP responses (p for interaction <0.05); seated PWV and supine BP and PWV responses were similar by sex (p for interaction >0.05). A simulated workday of prolonged sitting increased seated BP and supine cfPWV and caPWV, and posture minimally influenced these responses. These results add to the evidence suggesting a deleterious effect of prolonged sitting on cardiovascular health.","Alansare, Abdullah Bandar; Kowalsky, Robert J; Jones, Melissa A; Perdomo, Sophy J; Stoner, Lee; Gibbs, Bethany Barone",Journal of vascular research,103,8

Serial screening pulmonary function test (PFT) is recommended after transplantation for early diagnosis of BOS. However, little is known about the value or the optimum methods of serial PFT in this context. One hundred and 10 consecutive patients of 6 to 17 years of age at the time of transplantation who underwent allogeneic HSCT were recruited for this study. Screening PFTs were performed 1 week before transplantation and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after transplantation. When findings of obstructive lung disease were found on PFT, chest high-resolution computed tomography was performed. Of the 110 patients, 5 (4.5%) developed BOS. Of the 5 patients who developed BOS, 2 patients were diagnosed early by screening PFT. However, screening PFT did not allow for early diagnosis of BOS in the other 3 patients because BOS developed after 12 months of transplantation, which is beyond the PFT screening period. In conclusion, trimonthly PFTs performed through 12 months after transplantation in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT helped in the early diagnosis of BOS; however, there are some limitations to this screening protocol. Future studies will aid in the development of a new screening protocol that can subsequently be evaluated.","Yoon, Jong-Seo; Chun, Yoon Hong; Lee, Jae Wook; Chung, Nack Gyun; Cho, Bin",Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,103,17

We aimed to describe the incidence, reasons for and outcomes of use of alternative prophylactic agents (APAs) across SOT programs in our high volume centers. METHODS SOT recipients (SOTRs) at our centers from 1/2015-12/2016 were identified. Pharmacy records identified APA (pentamidine, atovaquone, or dapsone) use within one year. Records were reviewed for allergies, laboratory values at APA initiation, diagnostic tests for TMP-SMX -preventable opportunistic infections (OIs), and APA side effects. RESULTS An APA was initiated in 105/1173 (8.9%) SOTRs. Of these, 51 (48.6%) were due to sulfonamide allergy recorded pre- SOT, mostly rash/hives (58.8%). The remaining 54 (51.4%) had TMP-SMX discontinued post-SOT, mostly for neutropenia (48%) and renal effects (34%). Differences occurred across programs, with kidney transplant never stopping TMP-SMX for renal issues. Of those changed to APAs post-transplant, 19 (35%) were later successfully re-challenged with TMP-SMX. With thresholds in mind, 67 (64%) received an APA unnecessarily, accounting for up to $100,000/year excess cost. Potential TMP-SMX -preventable OIs occurred in 7 (5 Nocardia; 2 PJP). APA side effects occurred in 14/105 (13.3%). CONCLUSIONS Use of APAs for PJP prophylaxis after SOT is less than previously reported but often unwarranted. Such decisions require scrutiny to avoid TMP-SMX -preventable OIs, cost and important APA side effects. Use of reasonable thresholds for cessation of TMP-SMX and data-driven approaches to re-challenge would substantially reduce APA use.","Lum, Jessica; Echenique, Ignacio; Athans, Vasilios; Koval, Christine E",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,103,22

LIVHR is connected to a relatively rare but dangerous complication, enterotomy, especially in cases with complex adhesiolysis. Closure of the fascial defect and extirpation of the hernia sack may reduce the risk of seromas and other hernia-site events. Our aim was to evaluate whether hybrid operation has a lower rate of the early complications compared to the standard LIVHR. METHODS This is a multicenter randomized-controlled clinical trial. From November 2012 to May 2015, 193 patients undergoing LIVHR for primary incisional hernia with fascial defect size from 2 to 7 cm were recruited in 11 Finnish hospitals. Patients were randomized to either a laparoscopic (LG) or to a hybrid (HG) repair group. The outcome measures were the incidence of clinically and radiologically detected seromas and their extent 1 month after surgery, peri/postoperative complications, and pain. RESULTS Bulging was observed by clinical evaluation in 46 (49%) LG patients and in 27 (31%) HG patients (p = 0.022). Ultrasound examination detected more seromas (67 vs. 45%, p = 0.004) and larger seromas (471 vs. 112 cm3, p = 0.025) after LG than after HG. In LG, there were 5 (5.3%) enterotomies compared to 1 (1.1%) in HG (p = 0.108). Adhesiolysis was more complex in LG than in HG (26.6 vs. 13.3%, p = 0.028). Patients in HG had higher pain scores on the first postoperative day (VAS 5.2 vs. 4.3, p = 0.019). CONCLUSION Closure of the fascial defect and extirpation of the hernia sack reduce seroma formation. In hybrid operations, the risk of enterotomy seems to be lower than in laparoscopic repair, which should be considered in cases with complex adhesions.

HBV origins are enigmatic, and no zoonotic reservoirs are known. Here, we screened 3,080 specimens from 54 bat species representing 11 bat families for hepadnaviral DNA. Ten specimens (0.3%) from Panama and Gabon yielded unique hepadnaviruses in coancestral relation to HBV. Full genome sequencing allowed classification as three putative orthohepadnavirus species based on genome lengths (3,149-3,377 nt), presence of middle HBV surface and X-protein genes, and sequence distance criteria. Hepatic tropism in bats was shown by quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization. Infected livers showed histopathologic changes compatible with hepatitis. Human hepatocytes transfected with all three bat viruses cross-reacted with sera against the HBV core protein, concordant with the phylogenetic relatedness of these hepadnaviruses and HBV. One virus from Uroderma bilobatum, the tent-making bat, cross-reacted with monoclonal antibodies against the HBV antigenicity determining S domain. Up to 18.4% of bat sera contained antibodies against bat hepadnaviruses. Infectious clones were generated to study all three viruses in detail. Hepatitis D virus particles pseudotyped with surface proteins of U. bilobatum HBV, but neither of the other two viruses could infect primary human and Tupaia belangeri hepatocytes. Hepatocyte infection occurred through the human HBV receptor sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide but could not be neutralized by sera from vaccinated humans. Antihepadnaviral treatment using an approved reverse transcriptase inhibitor blocked replication of all bat hepadnaviruses. Our data suggest that bats may have been ancestral sources of primate hepadnaviruses. The observed zoonotic potential might affect concepts aimed at eradicating HBV.","Drexler, Jan Felix; Geipel, Andreas; König, Alexander; Corman, Victor M; van Riel, Debby; Leijten, Lonneke M; Bremer, Corinna M; Rasche, Andrea; Cottontail, Veronika M; Maganga, Gael D; Schlegel, Mathias; Müller, Marcel A; Adam, Alexander; Klose, Stefan M; Carneiro, Aroldo José Borges; Stöcker, Andreas; Franke, Carlos Roberto; Gloza-Rausch, Florian; Geyer, Joachim; Annan, Augustina; Adu-Sarkodie, Yaw; Oppong, Samuel; Binger, Tabea; Vallo, Peter; Tschapka, Marco; Ulrich, Rainer G; Gerlich, Wolfram H; Leroy, Eric; Kuiken, Thijs; Glebe, Dieter; Drosten, Christian",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,103,1

The rapid development and miniaturization of physiologging (i.e. logging of physiological variables such as heart rate, blood oxygen content, lactate, breathing frequency and tidal volume on devices attached to animals) technologies in recent times (e.g. devices that weigh less than 2 g mass that can measure electrical biopotentials for days to weeks) has provided astonishing insights into the physiology of free-living animals to document how and why wild animals undertake these extreme feats. Now, physiologging, which was traditionally hindered by technological limitations, device size, ethics and logistics, is poised to benefit enormously from the on-going developments in biomedical and sports wearables technologies.

Influenza A(H1N1), commonly called 'swine flu', is a novel influenza virus made up of porcine, avian and human genes, and preferentially infects younger people. Although Influenza A(H1N1) does not appear to be likely to cause as many fatalities as previous influenza pandemics, attempts to contain it are necessary because people whose health is already compromised through underlying chronic medical conditions are at risk of death if they contract the virus. In addition, pregnant women who become infected are at increased risk of complications. This paper provides figures on the number of cases of Influenza A(H1N1) and deaths associated with this virus in Australia (using World Health Organization and Australian Government figures) and discusses infection control measures that optometrists should put in place for themselves, their staff and their patients, in the event that there is suspicion of Influenza A(H1N1) infection. Measures include isolating those who display symptoms indicative of influenza, use of surgical masks (P2 [N95]) by the infected person, frequent hand-washing, appropriate cough and sneeze etiquette, disposal of used tissues and rescheduling of non-urgent appointments for those thought to be infected. Any staff members who need to be closer than one metre to the infected person should also use personal protective equipment (for example, surgical masks, goggles or safety spectacles, gowns and gloves). The current evidence indicates that Influenza A(H1N1) should be treated by optometrists as another type of flu. As with other forms of influenza, following basic infection control guidelines will help reduce the spread of infection in optometric practices and within the community.","Kiely, Patricia M; Lian, Ka-Yee; Napper, Genevieve; Lakkis, Carol",Clinical & experimental optometry,103,1

A common technique used in SILC is a 3-channel method. However, exposure of Calot's triangle is limited in conventional 3-channel SILC. Therefore, we herein report the adequacy and feasibility of 4-channel SILC using a snake retractor. METHODS Four hundred and fifteen SILC cases were performed between April 2010 and February 2013. We performed 326 SILC cases between April 2010 and September 2012 using the 3-channel method. We introduced a snake retractor for liver traction in October 2012, and 89 cases of 4-channel SILC using snake retractor have been performed since. RESULTS Thirty patients (9.2%) in the 3-channel SILC group, and 23 patients (25.8%) in the 4-channel SILC group, were treated with percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage insertion because of acute inflammation of the gallbladder (GB) before operation (P < 0.001). The mean operating time was 53.0 ± 25.8 minutes in the 3-channel SILC group and 51.9 ± 18.6 minutes in the 4-channel SILC group (P = 0.709). In the 3-channel SILC group, mean hospital stay was 3.0 ± 3.3 days whereas it was 2.6 ± 0.9 days in the 4-channel SILC group (P = 0.043). There were a total 9 cases (2.1%) of additional port usages, 6 cases (1.8%) in the 3-channel SILC group and 3 cases (3.4%) in the 4-channel SILC group (P = 0.411), due to cystic artery bleeding and bile leakage from gallbladder bed, but there were no open conversions. CONCLUSION Benign diseases of the GB can be operated on using SILC with the 4-channel method using a snake retractor.","Sung, Nak Song; Choi, In Seok; Moon, Ju Ik; Ra, Yu Mi; Lee, Sang Eok; Choi, Won Jun",Annals of surgical treatment and research,103,11

We have shown that exercise stress can increase susceptibility to infection. Quercetin, a flavonoid present in a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, has been reported to inhibit infectivity and replication of a broad spectrum of viruses and may offset the increase in susceptibility to infection associated with stressful exercise. This study examined the effects of quercetin feedings on susceptibility to the influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) following stressful exercise. Mice were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: exercise-placebo, exercise-quercetin, control-placebo, or control-quercetin. Exercise consisted of a run to fatigue (approximately 140 min) on a treadmill for 3 consecutive days. Quercetin (12.5 mg/kg) was administered via gavage for 7 days before viral challenge. At 30 min after the last bout of exercise or rest, mice (n=23-30) were intranasally inoculated with a standardized dose of influenza virus (0.04 hemagglutinating units). Mice were monitored daily for morbidity (time to sickness), symptom severity, and mortality (time to death) for 21 days. Exercise stress was associated with an increased susceptibility to infection [morbidity, mortality, and symptom severity on days 5-7 (P<0.05)]; quercetin offset the increase in susceptibility to infection [morbidity, mortality, and symptom severity on days 5-7 (P<0.05)] that was associated with stressful exercise. These data suggest that short-term quercetin feedings may prove to be an effective strategy to lessen the impact of stressful exercise on susceptibility to respiratory infection.","Davis, J M; Murphy, E A; McClellan, J L; Carmichael, M D; Gangemi, J D","American journal of physiology.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of VUS using a second-generation ultrasound (US) contrast agent and compare it with standard fluoroscopic voiding cystourethrography (VCUG). A total of 183 children with 366 kidney-ureter units (KUUs) underwent VUS and VCUG in the same session with the same catheterization. VUS was performed after intravesical administration of 1 ml of a second-generation ultrasound contrast agent (UCA; SonoVue, Bracco, Italy). VUR was detected in 140 out of 366 cases (38%); in 89 (24.3%) by both methods, in 37 (10.1%) by VUS only, and in 14 (3.8%) by VCUG only. Although there was considerable agreement in the diagnosis of VUR by VUS and VCUG (κ=0.68, standard error [κ]=0.04), the difference in the detection rate of reflux between VUS and VCUG was significant (p<0.00001). The grade of VUR detected with VUS showed moderate agreement with grading by VCUG. Our findings suggest that contrast-enhanced harmonic VUS using a second-generation contrast agent is superior to VCUG in the detection and grading of VUR, and it should be the method of choice for this clinical indication.","Kis, Eva; Nyitrai, Anna; Várkonyi, Ildikó; Máttyus, István; Cseprekál, Orsolya; Reusz, György; Szabó, Attila",Pediatric nephrology,103,1

METHODS Levels of physical activity (daily steps) were measured for 15 consecutive days using pedometers in 90 consecutive patients (prior to admission). Outcomes measured were cardiac and respiratory complications, length of stay, and 30-day re-admission rate. RESULTS A total of 78 patients' datasets were analysed (12 patients were excluded due to non-compliance). Based on steps performed they were divided into quartiles; 1 (low physical activity) to 4 (high physical activity). There were no significant differences in age, smoking history, COPD, BMI, percentage predicted FEV1 and KCO and cardiovascular risk factors between the groups. There were significantly fewer total complications in quartiles 3 and 4 (high physical activity) compared to quartiles 1 and 2 (low physical activity) (8 vs 22; P = .01). There was a trend (P > .05) towards shorter hospital length of stay in quartiles 3 and 4 (median values of 4 and 5 days, respectively) compared to quartiles 1 and 2 (6 days for both groups). CONCLUSIONS Preoperative physical activity can help to predict postoperative outcome and can be used to stratify risk of postoperative complications and to monitor impact of preoperative interventions, ultimately improving short term outcomes.","Billé, Andrea; Buxton, James; Viviano, Alessandro; Gammon, David; Veres, Lukacs; Routledge, Tom; Harrison-Phipps, Karen; Dixon, Allison; Minetto, Marco A",Integrative cancer therapies,103,1

Statistical models to evaluate the different outcomes of the study-arms will include study-arm as a factor along with any covariate that might affect the results. To ensure that the effects of the covariates are confounded to the least possible extent with the effects of the arms, stratified randomization can be applied. However, there is at present no clear-cut procedure when there are multiple covariates. METHODS For parallel study designs with simultaneous enrollment of all subjects prior to intervention, we propose a D-optimal blocking procedure to allocate subjects with known values of the covariates to the study arms. We prove that the procedure minimizes the variances of the baseline differences between the arms corrected for the covariates. The procedure uses standard statistical software. RESULTS We demonstrate the potential of the method by an application to a human parallel nutritional intervention trial with three arms and 162 healthy volunteers. The covariates were gender, age, body mass index, an initial composite health score, and a categorical indicator called first-visit group, defining groups of volunteers who visit the clinical centre on the same day (17 groups). Volunteers were allocated equally to the study-arms by the D-optimal blocking procedure. The D-efficiency of the model connecting an outcome with the study-arms and correcting for the covariates equals 99.2%. We simulated 10,000 random allocations of subjects to arms either unstratified or stratified by first-visit group. Intervals covering the middle 95% of the D-efficiencies for these allocations were [82.0, 92.0] and [93.2, 98.4], respectively. CONCLUSIONS Allocation of volunteers to study-arms with a D-optimal blocking procedure with the values of the covariates as inputs substantially improves the efficiency of the statistical model that connects the response with the study arms and corrects for the covariates.

However, the cervicocephalic circulatory bed offers more challenges to recanalization interventions. The historical development of reperfusion interventions has not previously been systematically compared. METHODS Medline search identified all multi-arm, controlled trials of coronary revascularization for acute myocardial infarction and multicenter trials of cerebral revascularization for acute ischemic stroke reporting angiographic reperfusion rates. RESULTS Thirty-seven trials of coronary reperfusion enrolled 10 908 patients from 1983 to 2009, and 10 trials of cerebral reperfusion enrolled 1064 patients from 1992 to 2009. Coronary reperfusion trials included 10 of intravenous fibrinolysis alone, 8 combined intravenous fibrinolysis and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with or without stenting, 3 intra-arterial fibrinolysis, and 16 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with or without stenting. Cerebral reperfusion trials included 1 of intravenous fibrinolysis alone, 3 intra-arterial fibrinolysis, 3 endovascular device alone, and 3 of endovascular treatment ± intravenous fibrinolysis. In both circulatory beds, endovascular treatments were more efficacious at achieving reperfusion than peripherally administered fibrinolytics. In the coronary bed, rates of achieved reperfusion began at high levels in the 1980s and improved modestly over the subsequent 3 decades. In the cerebral bed, reperfusion rates began at modest levels in the early 1990s and increased more slowly. Most recently, in 2005 to 2009, cardiac reperfusion rates substantially exceeded cerebral, partial reperfusion 86.1% versus 61.1%, complete reperfusion 78.6% versus 23.4%. CONCLUSIONS Reperfusion therapies developed more slowly and remain less effective for cerebral than cardiac ischemia. Further, cerebral circulation-specific technical advances are required for physicians to become as capable at safely restoring blood flow to the ischemic brain as the ischemic heart.","Patel, Richa D; Saver, Jeffrey L",Stroke,103,1

Antiinflammatory corticosteroids targeting the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) are the current standard of care but drive adverse side effects such as deleterious bone loss. Through subtle modification to a steroidal backbone, a recently developed drug, vamorolone, appears to preserve beneficial efficacy but with significantly reduced side effects. We use combined structural, biophysical, and biochemical approaches to show that loss of a receptor-ligand hydrogen bond drives these remarkable therapeutic effects. Moreover, vamorolone uniformly weakens coactivator associations but not corepressor associations, implicating partial agonism as the main driver of its dissociative properties. Additionally, we identify a critical and evolutionarily conserved intramolecular network connecting the ligand to the coregulator binding surface. Interruption of this allosteric network by vamorolone selectively reduces GR-driven transactivation while leaving transrepression intact. Our results establish a mechanistic understanding of how vamorolone reduces side effects, guiding the future design of partial agonists as selective GR modulators with an improved therapeutic index.","Liu, Xu; Wang, Yashuo; Gutierrez, Jennifer S; Damsker, Jesse M; Nagaraju, Kanneboyina; Hoffman, Eric P; Ortlund, Eric A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,103,1

Additionally, the windrow temperature exceeded 55 °C for >5 days, indicating that the composting products from both facilities were safe. These results were supported by 4 days aerobic static respiration rate tests. The emissions were low enough to avoid any impact on nearby communities (distance <100 m).

However, low solubility limits its clinical usage. OBJECTIVES To improve the efficacy of icaritin treatment, a micelle system was designed for targeted delivery of drugs to OSCC cells. METHODS In the present study, the micelles loaded with icaritin were self-assembled from the amphipathic polymer via film dispersion. Nanoparticles were characterized with the transmission electron microscope and dynamic light scattering. The cytotoxicity of icaritin nanoparticles was analyzed by CCK-8, and in vitro target-selective intracellular uptake behaviors were observed using a laser confocal microscope. RESULTS The micelles were spherical with the mean diameter of 121.2 nm. In vitro studies revealed that icaritin was stablely and slowly released from micelles. Cytotoxicity analysis demonstrated that icartin-loaded micelles exhibited better therapeu-tic efficacy compared with free icaritin. Cellular uptake and intracellular release results revealed that micelles efficiently de-livered icaritin into OSCC cells.

Benefits may include improved teamwork, staff well-being and identification of learning opportunities. Existing literature indicates that while staff value HoD following significant events, it is infrequently undertaken in practice. Internationally, several frameworks for HoD have been developed, although none are widely adopted for use in the ED. A quality improvement project was conducted to introduce HoD into a single UK ED in North West England, between January and March 2019. Following stakeholder consultation, the 9-item 'TAKE STOCK' tool was developed. Implementation of the tool increased the number of HoD (0-2.2 HoD episodes/week). Findings from the first plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycle are presented, which revealed the key strengths and limitations of this model. Staff perceptions of the tool were evaluated using a self-administered short questionnaire designed by the authors. Satisfaction with TAKE STOCK was assessed using 10-point numerical scales. Across respondents (n-15), average satisfaction scores exceeded 9 out of 10 concerning patient care, staff self-care, decision-making, education, teamwork and identification of equipment issues. Implementation of HoD into the ED is feasible and viewed as beneficial by staff. Implementation toolkits for TAKE STOCK have been requested by 42 additional UK hospitals and ambulance trusts, demonstrating significant interest in its use.

In this study, to ascertain the anticancer potential of the molecule, we screened it against different cell lines and compared the activity against the standard drug doxorubicin. The molecule showed promising activity at a low concentration against almost all cell lines used in the study. Apart from that, the molecule was characterized for its pKa and a precise reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography bioanalytical method has been developed. The method was validated according to the United States of Food and Drug Administration bioanalytical guideline and was found to produce linear response over the calibration range of 0.8-25 μg/mL. Inter- and intra-day accuracy were found to be in the range of 93.44-99.74%, whereas precision [% coefficient of variation (CV)] for inter- and intra-day was ranged between 1.63 and 5.79%, and 0.87 and 6.96%, respectively. The bioanalytical stability testing was carried out in different conditions including 8 h benchtop, 12 h autosampler and three freeze-thaw cycles. The analyte was stable in all the tested stability conditions. Finally, an in vitro metabolite identification study was conducted using quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometer, and two metabolites have been identified.","Zagade, Aarati Dilip; Shard, Amit; Shinde, Shital; Sahu, Amit Kumar; Sengupta, Pinaki",Journal of chromatographic science,103,1

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed data for 311 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery at a single institute. The mean age at time of treatment was 60 years (range 23-86 years), and the median Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score was 90 (range 60-100). Using a new prognostic index, the prognostic index for brain metastases (PIBM), the patients were categorized into 3 groups according to the primary tumor status and KPS score. We performed survival analysis and compared the prognostic ability of the PIBM with other published indices. RESULTS During the median follow-up duration of 8.2 months (range 0.1-109 months), the median overall survival time was 9.1 months. Stable primary tumor status (hazard ratio [HR] 0.497, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.321-0.769, p = 0.002) and KPS score ≥90 (HR 1.407, 95% CI 1.018-1.946, p = 0.039) significantly predicted longer overall survival. The PIBM showed the lowest Akaike information criterion value and the highest integrated area under the curve value compared with other prognostic indices. CONCLUSIONS The PIBM may be a more accurate prognostic indicator than other published indices. Although this new and practical prognostic index requires further validation in larger cohort studies, we suggest that the PIBM could be useful to predict survival time and inform appropriate management of patients with brain metastases.","Lee, Sang Ryul; Roh, Tae Hoon; Jeong, Dong Hwan; You, Namkyu; Jang, Ae Hwa; Seo, Mi Ra; Choung, Jin Hee; Park, Bumhee; Kim, Se-Hyuk",Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery,103,6

The monitoring of splanchnic oximetry through the use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an emerging method used to assess tissue oxygenation status. Splanchnic tissue oxygenation (SrSO2) is thought to be potentially of high value in critically ill patients because gastrointestinal organs can often be the first to suffer ischemic injury. During conditions of hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction, or decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, blood flow is diverted toward vital organs, such as the brain and the heart at the expense of the splanchnic circulation. While monitoring SrSO2 has great potential benefit, there are limitations to the technology and techniques. SrSO2 has been found to have a relatively high degree of variability that can potentially make it difficult to interpret. In addition, because splanchnic organs only lie near the skin surface in children and infants, and energy from currently available sensors only penetrates a few centimeters deep, it can be difficult to use clinically in a noninvasive manner in adults. Research thus far is showing that splanchnic oximetry holds great promise in the ability to monitor patient oxygenation status and detect disease states in humans, especially in pediatric populations.","Bailey, Sean M; Mally, Pradeep V",Journal of biomedical optics,103,26

IPH rates are high with the current standard of care, forced air warming (FAW). Our hypothesis is that a prototype thermal compression device that heats the popliteal fossa and soles of the feet, with lower leg compression, increases perioperative temperatures and reduces IPH compared to the current standard of care. METHODS Thirty six female breast surgery patients, at a tertiary academic hospital, were randomized to the device or intraoperative FAW (stage I) with a further 18 patients randomized to the device with a single heating area only (stage II, popliteal fossa or sole of the feet). Stage I: 37 patients recruited (final 36). Stage II: 18 patients recruited (final 18). INCLUSION CRITERIA general anesthesia with esophageal monitoring for over 30 min, legs available and able to fit the device and no contraindications to leg heating or compression. The intervention was: Stage I: Investigational prototype thermal compression device (full device group) or intraoperative FAW. Stage II: Device with only a single heating location. Primary outcomes were perioperative temperatures and incidence of IPH. Secondary outcomes were local skin temperature, general and thermal comfort scores and presence of perioperative complications, including blood loss. RESULTS Mean temperatures in the full device group were significantly higher than the FAW group in the pre-operative (36.7 vs 36.4 °C, p < 0.001), early intraoperative (36.3 vs 35.9 °C, p < 0.001), intraoperative (36.6 vs 36.2 °C, p < 0.001) and postoperative periods (36.8 vs 36.5 °C, p < 0.001). The incidence of IPH in the device group was also significantly lower (16.7% vs 72.0%, p = 0.001). Thermal comfort scores were significantly higher in the full device group and hypothermia associated wound complications were higher in the FAW group. CONCLUSIONS The thermal compression device is feasible and has efficacy over the FAW. Further studies are recommended to investigate clinically significant outcomes.

DATA SOURCES PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception until January 2013 using the following keywords in various combinations: ARDS, treatment, nitric oxide, heliox, steroids, surfactant, etanercept, prostaglandin therapy, inhaled beta adrenergic receptor agonists, N-acetylcysteine, ipratroprium bromide, dornase, plasminogen activators, fibrinolytics or other anticoagulants, and children. No language restrictions were applied. References from identified articles were searched for additional publications. STUDY SELECTION All clinical studies pertaining to pulmonary-specific therapeutic approaches to pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome were reviewed. If clinical pediatric data were sparse or unavailable, the findings from studies of adult acute respiratory distress syndrome and animal models that might be relevant to pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome were examined. DATA EXTRACTION All relevant studies were reviewed and pertinent data abstracted. DATA SYNTHESIS Over the course of three international meetings, the pertinent findings of the literature review were discussed by a panel of 24 experts in the field representing 21 academic institutions and 8 countries. Recommendations developed and the supporting literature were distributed to all panel members without a conflict of interest and were scored by using the Research ANd Development/University of California, Los Angeles Appropriateness method. The modified Delphi approach was used as the methodology to achieve consensus among the panel. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the routine use of surfactant, inhaled nitric oxide, glucocorticoids, prone positioning, endotracheal suctioning, and chest physiotherapy cannot be recommended. Inhaled nitric oxide should only be used for patients with documented pulmonary hypertension and/or right ventricular failure. Prone positioning may be considered in patients with severe pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. Future studies are definitely warranted to establish the role, if any, of these ancillary treatment modalities in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Tamburro, Robert F; Kneyber, Martin C J",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,103,1

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has emerged as an important alternative to simplify the diagnostics of infectious diseases. In addition, an advantage of LAMP is that it allows for easy reading of the final result through visual detection. However, this step must be performed with caution to avoid contamination and false-positive results. LAMP performed on microfluidic platforms can minimize false-positive results, in addition to having potential for point-of-care applications. Here, we describe a polystyrene-toner (PS-T) centrifugal microfluidic device manually controlled by a fidget spinner for molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-LAMP, with integrated and automated colorimetric detection. The amplification was carried out in a microchamber with 5 μL capacity, and the reaction was thermally controlled with a thermoblock at 72 °C for 10 min. At the end of the incubation time, the detection of amplified RT-LAMP fragments was performed directly on the chip by automated visual detection. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to detect COVID-19 in reactions initiated with approximately 10-3 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Clinical samples were tested using our RT-LAMP protocol as well as by conventional RT-qPCR, demonstrating comparable performance to the CDC SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay. The methodology described in this study represents a simple, rapid, and accurate method for rapid molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 in a disposable microdevice, ideal for point-of-care testing (POCT) systems.","de Oliveira, Kézia Gomes; Estrela, Paulo Felipe Neves; Mendes, Geovana de Melo; Dos Santos, Carlos Abelardo; Silveira-Lacerda, Elisângela de Paula; Duarte, Gabriela Rodrigues Mendes",The Analyst,103,12

Modeling stent and FD deployment in patient-specific aneurysms and its flow modification results prior to the actual intervention can potentially predict the patient outcome and treatment optimization. We present a clinically focused, streamlined virtual stenting workflow that efficiently simulates stent and FD treatment in patient-specific aneurysms based on expanding a simplex mesh structure. The simplex mesh is generated using an innovative vessel-specific initialization technique, which uses the patient's parent artery diameter to identify the initial position of the simplex mesh inside the artery. A novel adaptive expansion algorithm enables the acceleration of deployment process by adjusting the expansion forces based on the distance of the simplex mesh from the parent vessel. The virtual stenting workflow was tested by modeling the treatment of two patient-specific aneurysms using the Enterprise stent and the Pipeline Embolization Device (commercial FD). Both devices were deployed in the aneurysm models in a few seconds. Computational fluid dynamics analyses of pre- and post-treatment aneurysmal hemodynamics show flow reduction in the aneurysmal sac in treated aneurysms, with the FD diverting more flow than the Enterprise stent. The test results show that this workflow can rapidly simulate clinical deployment of stents and FDs, hence paving the way for its future clinical implementation.","Paliwal, Nikhil; Yu, Hongyu; Xu, Jinhui; Xiang, Jianping; Siddiqui, Adnan; Yang, Xinjian; Li, Haiyun; Meng, Hui",Computer methods in biomechanics and biomedical engineering,103,16

While contraceptive use has increased significantly over the past decade, discontinuation and gaps in use remain common. Although women cite side effects as the reason for discontinuing or stopping methods, little is known about the specific ways in which contraception affects women's sexual experiences. This systematic scoping review aimed to understand how contraceptive-induced side effects relating to women's sexual experiences have been measured, classified, and explored in the literature, specifically in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were peer-reviewed, English-language articles published between 2003 and 2018 that examined women's sexual experiences related to their use of modern contraception, including sexual satisfaction, arousal, sexual dysfunction, discomfort, vaginal dryness, sexual frequency, and relationship or partner dynamics. Study populations were restricted to women of reproductive age in LMICs. Twenty-two studies were deemed eligible for inclusion, comprising a range of methods and geographies. Emergent sexual experience themes included: menstrual issues impacting sexual experience; libido; lubrication; sexual pleasure; dyspareunia; and female sexual function. Results highlight the variability in measures used, lack of a women-centred perspective, and void in research outside of high-income countries to study the influence of contraception on women's sexual experiences. Very few studies focused on women's sexual experiences as the primary outcome or predictor. Providers should adopt woman-centred contraceptive counselling that considers women's relationships. Further research is needed to disentangle the nuanced effects of contraception on women's sex lives, contraceptive decision-making, and method continuation.","Wood, Shannon N; Karp, Celia; Zimmerman, Linnea",Sexual and reproductive health matters,103,1

Without attempting to provide an exhaustive list of ways in which this might be done, I identify four broad measures that I believe many, if not most, states ought to take. These require states to (i) help ensure that people have affordable access to the internet, as well as opportunities for learning how to use this medium so as that they can digitally connect to others; (ii) help people to have harmonious and rewarding intimate relationships; and try to make (iii) non-human companionship as well as (iv) various non-social solutions to loneliness widely available.","de Vries, Bouke",Kennedy Institute of Ethics journal,103,11

DESIGN AND METHODS The effects of intestinal bypass alone (duodenal-jejunal bypass -DJB) and gastric resection alone (SG) in Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats were compared. Additional animals underwent a combination procedure (SG + DJB). Outcome measures included changes in weight, food intake (FI), oral glucose tolerance (GT) and gut hormones. RESULTS DJB did not substantially affect weight and FI, whereas SG significantly reduced weight gain and food consumption. DJB rats showed weight-independent improvement in GT, which improved less after SG. Furthermore, SG significantly suppressed plasma ghrelin and increased insulin, glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and peptide YY response to oral glucose whereas DJB had no effects on postprandial levels of these hormones. DJB restored postprandial glucagon suppression in diabetic rats whereas SG did not affect glucagon response. The combination procedure (SG + DJB) induced greater weight loss and better GT than SG alone without reducing food intake further. CONCLUSIONS These findings reveal a dominant role of the stomach in the regulation of body weight and incretin response to oral glucose whereas intestinal bypass primarily affects glucose homeostasis by a weight-, insulin- and incretin-independent mechanism.","Patel, Rajesh T; Shukla, Alpana P; Ahn, Soo Min; Moreira, Marlus; Rubino, Francesco",Obesity,103,33

The primary outcome was the percentage of BIS values between 40 and 60 (BIS(40-60)). METHODS This randomized controlled phase II trial in the intensive care unit (ICU) was conducted in adults with multiorgan failure. Thirty-one patients were assigned to receive sedation with propofol or remifentanil either by an automated or a manual system, both targeting BIS(40-60). Performance and feasibility of an automated administration were assessed. RESULTS The study groups were well balanced in terms of demographic characteristics. Study duration averaged 18 [8-24] h in the automated group and 14 [9-21] h in the manual group (p = 0.81). Adequate sedation (BIS(40-60)) was significantly more frequent in the automated group 77 [59-82] % than in the manual group 36 [22-56] %, with p = 0.001. Propofol consumption was reduced by a factor of 2 in the automated group with a median change of infusion rates of 39 ± 9 times per hour. In contrast, there were only 2 ± 1 propofol and 1 ± 1 remifentanil dose changes per hour in the manual group compared to 40 ± 9 for remifentanil in the automated group (p < 0.001). Vasopressors were more often discontinued or reduced in the automated group than in the manual control group (36 [6-40] vs. 12 [4-20] modifications, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Continuous titration of propofol and remifentanil sedation with an automatic controller maintains deep sedation better than manual control in severely ill patients. It is associated with reduced sedative and vasopressor use.","Le Guen, Morgan; Liu, Ngai; Bourgeois, Eric; Chazot, Thierry; Sessler, Daniel I; Rouby, Jean-Jacques; Fischler, Marc",Intensive care medicine,103,31

Such surveys are of importance in determining the potential for novel viruses to emerge in humans, and for optimal management of bats and their habitats. To enhance our knowledge of the viral diversity present in bats, we initially surveyed 415 sera from African and Central American bats. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing revealed the presence of a highly diverse group of bat-derived viruses related to hepaciviruses and pegiviruses within the family Flaviridae. Subsequent PCR screening of 1,258 bat specimens collected worldwide indicated the presence of these viruses also in North America and Asia. A total of 83 bat-derived viruses were identified, representing an infection rate of nearly 5%. Evolutionary analyses revealed that all known hepaciviruses and pegiviruses, including those previously documented in humans and other primates, fall within the phylogenetic diversity of the bat-derived viruses described here. The prevalence, unprecedented viral biodiversity, phylogenetic divergence, and worldwide distribution of the bat-derived viruses suggest that bats are a major and ancient natural reservoir for both hepaciviruses and pegiviruses and provide insights into the evolutionary history of hepatitis C virus and the human GB viruses.","Quan, Phenix-Lan; Firth, Cadhla; Conte, Juliette M; Williams, Simon H; Zambrana-Torrelio, Carlos M; Anthony, Simon J; Ellison, James A; Gilbert, Amy T; Kuzmin, Ivan V; Niezgoda, Michael; Osinubi, Modupe O V; Recuenco, Sergio; Markotter, Wanda; Breiman, Robert F; Kalemba, Lems; Malekani, Jean; Lindblade, Kim A; Rostal, Melinda K; Ojeda-Flores, Rafael; Suzan, Gerardo; Davis, Lora B; Blau, Dianna M; Ogunkoya, Albert B; Alvarez Castillo, Danilo A; Moran, David; Ngam, Sali; Akaibe, Dudu; Agwanda, Bernard; Briese, Thomas; Epstein, Jonathan H; Daszak, Peter; Rupprecht, Charles E; Holmes, Edward C; Lipkin, W Ian",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,103,27

Bacterial biofilms and encrustation cause significant complications in patients with urinary catheters. The objective of the study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an anti-microbial and anti-encrustation silver nanoparticle (AgNP) coating on silicone urinary catheter in two different animal models. METHODS Antifouling coating (P3) was prepared with alternate layers of polydopamine and AgNP and an outermost antifouling layer. Sixteen C57BL/6 female mice and two female PWG Micropigs® were used to perform the experiments. In mice, a 5 mm long silicone catheter with or without P3 was transurethrally placed into the urinary bladder. Micropigs were transurethrally implanted - one with P3 silicone catheter and the other with commercially available silver coated silicone catheter. Both models were challenged with E. coli. Bacteriuria was evaluated routinely and upon end of study (2 weeks for mice, 3 weeks for micropigs), blood, catheters and bladders were harvested and analysed for bacterial colonization and encrustation as well as for toxicity. RESULTS Lower bacterial colonization was seen on P3 catheters as well as in bladders of animals with P3 catheter. Bacteriuria was consistently less in mice with P3 catheter than with uncoated catheters. Encrustation was lower on P3 catheter and in bladder of micropig with P3 catheter. No significant toxicity of P3 was observed in mice or in micropig as compared to controls. The numbers were small in this proof of concept study and technical issues were noted especially with the porcine model. CONCLUSIONS Antifouling P3 coating reduces bacterial colonization on catheter and in animal bladders without causing any considerable toxicity for 2 to 3 weeks.

We present our initial experience using a simple retraction device to reduce these problems. MATERIAL AND METHODS In January 2012 a novel lifter was introduced at our department and subsequently used in SPLC for suspension of the gallbladder. Perioperative data were collected prospectively. In addition, all videos were reviewed to assess any adverse events caused by the lifter. RESULTS Thirty (20 female and 10 male) patients at a median age of 48.4 years (range: 23-83) were operated using this novel retraction device. Median BMI accounted for 26.0 kg/m(2) (median; range: 14.0-36.9). Retraction of the gallbladder using the lifter was possible in all patients. In four cases (13.3 %) spillage of bile caused by the lifter was recorded. In addition, perforation of the gallbladder was seen once (3.3 %), caused by electrocautery. No inflammation, induration or visible scars were seen in the right upper quadrant at six weeks postoperatively in any patient. CONCLUSIONS Gallbladder retraction in SPLC using this novel device is feasible and safe without leaving any apparent scar. Rate of bile spillage is (at least) comparable to that reported for conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","Dauser, Bernhard; Ghaffari, Shahbaz; Herbst, Friedrich",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,103,23

This is the first study to investigate mental health, i. e. adjustment disorder, depression, stress symptoms, Corona related fears as well as coping mechanisms in this group in a German-speaking country. MATERIAL AND METHODS In April 2020, N=100 subjects were recruited that currently are engaged in a hospital. A series of standardized assessments were included: adjustment disorder (ADNM-20), depression (PHQ-9), stress symptoms and coping strategies (SCI). Currently, cross-sectional data are analyzed, because the study is still going on and longitudinal data is not yet assessed. RESULTS Frequencies of adjustment disorder and depression are 8 and 15%, respectively. Two hierarchical regression models were run to predict adjustment disorder and depression; predictive power was higher for the first (41 vs. 35%). Fear of infection was reported to be higher regarding one's family than oneself. Nursing staff, those with preloads, and women were found to report more mental health problems. Those with direct contact to people that fell ill with COVID-19 did not differ from those with no direct contact. DISCUSSION Currently, medical staff has a high risk for being mentally stressed. China, being epidemically experienced, has published principles for psychiatric interventions in January 2020. This might be relevant for Switzerland, too. Specific psychotherapeutic interventions, targeting at cognitive restructuring and sensitizing regarding dealing with alcohol and cigarettes, may be needed in order to protect this vulnerable group of person during and after the Corona pandemic.","Krammer, Sandy; Augstburger, Roland; Haeck, Martina; Maercker, Andreas","Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik, medizinische Psychologie",103,1

Failure to identify adverse drug reactions (ADRs) can lead to prescribing cascades and the unnecessary use of over-the-counter products. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to explore and quantify the frequency and severity of ADRs associated with amitriptyline vs. placebo in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults with any indication, as well as healthy individuals. METHODS A systematic search in six electronic databases, forward/backward searches, manual searches, and searches for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval studies, will be performed. Placebo-controlled RCTs evaluating amitriptyline in any dosage, regardless of indication and without restrictions on the time and language of publication, will be included, as will healthy individuals. Studies of topical amitriptyline, combination therapies, or including < 100 participants, will be excluded. Two investigators will screen the studies independently, assess methodological quality, and extract data on design, population, intervention, and outcomes ((non-)anticholinergic ADRs, e.g., symptoms, test results, and adverse drug events (ADEs) such as falls). The primary outcome will be the frequency of anticholinergic ADRs as a binary outcome (absolute number of patients with/without anticholinergic ADRs) in amitriptyline vs. placebo groups. Anticholinergic ADRs will be defined by an experienced clinical pharmacologist, based on literature and data from Martindale: The Complete Drug Reference. Secondary outcomes will be frequency and severity of (non-)anticholinergic ADRs and ADEs. The information will be synthesized in meta-analyses and narratives. We intend to assess heterogeneity using meta-regression (for indication, outcome, and time points) and I2 statistics. Binary outcomes will be expressed as odds ratios, and continuous outcomes as standardized mean differences. Effect measures will be provided using 95% confidence intervals. We plan sensitivity analyses to assess methodological quality, outcome reporting etc., and subgroup analyses on age, dosage, and duration of treatment. DISCUSSION We will quantify the frequency of anticholinergic and other ADRs/ADEs in adults taking amitriptyline for any indication by comparing rates for amitriptyline vs. placebo, hence, preventing bias from disease symptoms and nocebo effects. As no standardized instrument exists to measure it, our overall estimate of anticholinergic ADRs may have limitations.

For many people, this involves the necessity of adapting to new conditions, uncertainty about the future and a tremendous mental burden. It was investigated whether there were any differences between the 2 measures (before and during the COVID-19 pandemic) in the levels of perceived stress, anxiety, life satisfaction and experienced emotions. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study, conducted in Poland and the Netherlands, involved 168 people. The metric, the Positive and Negative Experience Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, the and the Satisfaction With Life Scale were used. The subjects were divided into 3 groups: non-immigrants living in Poland (N = 50), Dutch citizens (N = 56), and Polish immigrants living in the Netherlands (N = 62). RESULTS The level of stress and negative emotions was higher in the groups of Poles living in Poland and Poles living in the Netherlands than in the group of Dutch citizens. Therefore, access to psychological care should be improved during the pandemic, especially for immigrants, due to the increased risk of developing stress-induced mental disorders. CONCLUSIONS In the groups of Poles, there was an increase in perceived stress and trait anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. The group of Dutch citizens experienced a reduction in the anxiety level during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the group of Polish immigrants, there was an increase in life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bujek-Kubas, Iwona Celina; Mojs, Ewa",International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,103,27

It is a cytoplasmic stain that detects a melanocyte-specific cytoplasmic protein involved in the formation of stage II melanosomes. Clinically, Melan-A is primarily used to detect and confirm melanocytic tumors although it is also positively expressed in adrenal cortical tumors and sex cord stromal tumors. We found that Melan-A also detected and highlighted Henderson-Patterson bodies of molluscum poxvirus. To determine if other melanocytic markers detect molluscum contagiosum bodies, S-100, HMB-45, MITF, and SOX-10 were also tested. In 15 tested molluscum cases, Melan-A stains were positive in all cases, whereas the other tested melanocytic markers were negative. Our results confirm that Melan-A is very sensitive in detecting molluscum contagiosum bodies and could be clinically useful to supplement the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) in cases that are very inflamed or only have limited biopsy material.","Vincek, Erik; Rudnick, Eric",Journal of histotechnology,103,9

However, LUS remains limited to the visual inspection of ultrasound data, thus negatively affecting the reliability and reproducibility of the findings. Moreover, many different imaging protocols have been proposed, most of which lacked proper clinical validation. To address these problems, we were the first to propose a standardized imaging protocol and scoring system. Next, we developed the first deep learning (DL) algorithms capable of evaluating LUS videos providing, for each video-frame, the score as well as semantic segmentation. Moreover, we have analyzed the impact of different imaging protocols and demonstrated the prognostic value of our approach. In this work, we report on the level of agreement between the DL and LUS experts, when evaluating LUS data. The results show a percentage of agreement between DL and LUS experts of 85.96% in the stratification between patients at high risk of clinical worsening and patients at low risk. These encouraging results demonstrate the potential of DL models for the automatic scoring of LUS data, when applied to high quality data acquired accordingly to a standardized imaging protocol.","Mento, Federico; Perrone, Tiziano; Fiengo, Anna; Smargiassi, Andrea; Inchingolo, Riccardo; Soldati, Gino; Demi, Libertario",The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,103,31

Objective To investigate the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the environmental surfaces of an ophthalmology examination room after visits by patients who were asymptomatic and had passed COVID-19 triage. Design, Setting, and Participants This is a quality improvement study conducted 1 week after the first officially confirmed COVID-19 case in İzmir Tepecik Training and Research Hospital, İzmir, Turkey, on March 20, 2020. A triage system was used to determine the risk of COVID-19 from patients who were asymptomatic and presented for examination in an ophthalmology clinic. Real-time polymerase chain reaction testing was used to detect the presence of viral RNA material in samples from the biomicroscope stage, slitlamp breath shield, phoropter, tonometer, and door handles. The first group of samples was taken before the beginning of the examinations, and the second group of the samples was taken after the last patient had left the room. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was the presence of viral material on surfaces in 5 circular zones with a diameter of 1 m each around where the patients sat. Results Thirty-one persons visited the room, of whom 22 underwent ophthalmic examination and 9 were companions. The mean (SD) examination time was 9 (4) minutes (range, 5-13 minutes). Seven samples were taken before examinations and 7 after examinations. Two samples that were taken after examinations were found to be positive for COVID-19, 1 from the slitlamp breath shield and 1 from the phoropter. Conclusions and Relevance This study showed the presence of COVID-19 viral material in a circle 1 m in diameter around where the patients sat. However, real-time polymerase chain reaction could only detect viral material, not the infectivity of these virus samples.","Aytogan, Hasan; Ayintap, Emre; Özkalay Yilmaz, Nisel",JAMA ophthalmology,103,12

This is the first known reported invasive Haemophilus influenzae serotype A from Saudi Arabia. CASE PRESENTATION A ten-month-old and three-month-old male not known to have any past history of any medical illness and who had received H. influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine presented to our hospital mainly with fever of few days' duration. A provisional diagnosis of meningitis with sepsis was made and laboratory tests were requested. The chest radiograph was normal. The laboratory results revealed leukocytosis, but leukopenia was noticed in the younger infant. Blood culture and cerebrospinal fluid specimens yielded a pure culture of Haemophilus influenzae and serotyping showed the isolates to be serogroup A. Both patients were started on vancomycin and third-generation cephalosporin. On receiving the blood culture result, vancomycin was stopped. Fever subsided after 48 hours, while in the second case, it continued for 12 days from the admission date. The repeat blood cultures were negative. Antibiotic therapy was given for 10 days for the first case with an unremarkable hospital course, while the second case was complicated by seizure and received a longer duration of antibiotics. Both infants were discharged home in good condition. CONCLUSIONS Invasive non-typeable H. influenzae strains are emerging and there is a need for surveillance of this disease. This has implications in future vaccine development.","Roaa, Zailaie; Abdulsalam, Alawfi; Shahid, Ghazi; Kamaldeen, Baba; Tariq, Al Fawaz",Journal of infection in developing countries,103,1

We present preliminary clinical and angiographic results of an experimentally optimized Surpass flow diverter for treatment of intracranial aneurysms in a prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized, single-arm study. MATERIALS AND METHODS At 24 centers, 165 patients with 190 intracranial aneurysms of the anterior and posterior circulations were enrolled. The primary efficacy end point was the percentage of intracranial aneurysms with 100% occlusion on 6-month DSA. The primary safety end point was neurologic death and any stroke through a minimum follow-up of 6 months. RESULTS Successful flow-diverter delivery was achieved in 161 patients with 186 aneurysms (98%); the mean number of devices used per aneurysm was 1.05. Clinical follow-up (median, 6 months) of 150 patients (93.2%), showed that the primary safety end point occurred in 18 subjects. Permanent neurologic morbidity and mortality were 6% and 2.7%, respectively. Morbidity occurred in 4% and 7.4% of patients treated for aneurysms of the anterior and posterior circulation, respectively. Neurologic death during follow-up was observed in 1.6% and 7.4% of patients with treated intracranial aneurysms of the anterior and posterior circulation, respectively. Ischemic stroke at ≤30 days, SAH at ≤7 days, and intraparenchymal hemorrhage at ≤7 days were encountered in 3.7%, 2.5%, and 2.5% of subjects, respectively. No disabling ischemic strokes at >30 days or SAH at >7 days occurred. New or worsening cranial nerve deficit was observed in 2.7%. Follow-up angiography available in 158 (86.8%) intracranial aneurysms showed 100% occlusion in 75%. CONCLUSIONS Clinical outcomes of the Surpass flow diverter in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms show a safety profile that is comparable with that of stent-assisted coil embolization. Angiographic results showed a high rate of intracranial aneurysm occlusion.","Wakhloo, A K; Lylyk, P; de Vries, J; Taschner, C; Lundquist, J; Biondi, A; Hartmann, M; Szikora, I; Pierot, L; Sakai, N; Imamura, H; Sourour, N; Rennie, I; Skalej, M; Beuing, O; Bonafé, A; Mery, F; Turjman, F; Brouwer, P; Boccardi, E; Valvassori, L; Derakhshani, S; Litzenberg, M W; Gounis, M J",AJNR.

There is consensus that the patient that would benefit most has early-stage DD, with a predicted deterioration in the near future. To identify this patient, the aim of this study was to identify prognostic factors for progression of DD. Study design Systematic review. Methods A systematic search was performed on studies evaluating one or more prognostic factor(s) in the progression of DD. The criteria for inclusion were (a) patients diagnosed with DD on MRI, (b) progression of DD at follow-up, and (c) reporting of one or more prognostic factor(s) in progression of DD. Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. Due to heterogeneity in DD determinants and outcomes, only a best-evidence synthesis could be conducted. Results The search generated 3165 references, of which 16 studies met our inclusion criteria, involving 2.423 patients. Within these, a total of 23 clinical and environmental and 12 imaging factors were identified. There was strong evidence that disc herniation at baseline is associated with progression of DD at follow-up. There is limited evidence that IL6 rs1800795 genotype G/C male was associated with no progression of DD. Some clinical or environmental factors such as BMI, occupation and smoking were not associated with progression. Conclusions Disc herniation is strongly associated with the progression of DD. Surprisingly, there was strong evidence that smoking, occupation, and several other factors were not associated with the progression of DD. Only one genetic variant may have a protective effect on progression, otherwise there was conflicting or only limited evidence for most prognostic factors. Future research into these prognostic factors with conflicting and limited evidence is not only needed to determine which patients should be targeted by regenerative therapies, but will also contribute to spinal phenotyping.","Rustenburg, Christine M E; Faraj, Sayf S A; Ket, Johannes C F; Emanuel, Kaj S; Smit, Theodoor H",JOR spine,103,24

We aimed to analyze the risk factors for this problem, and to identify the methods used for its prevention and management. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 716 consecutive patients who underwent curative gastrectomy with a duodenal stump for gastric cancer between 2008 and 2013. RESULTS A duodenal stump fistula occurred in 16 patients (2.2%) and there were 2 deaths in this group. Univariate analysis revealed age >60 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-9.66), multiple comorbidities (OR, 4.23; 95% CI, 1.50-11.92), clinical T stage (OR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.045-8.10), and gastric outlet obstruction (OR, 8.64; 95% CI, 2.61-28.61) to be significant factors for developing a duodenal stump fistula.

Models for plasma exchange with either veno-arterial or veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are considered. Two classes of models are derived for each case, one in the form of an algebraic delay equation and another in the form of a system of delay differential equations. In special cases, our models reduce to single compartment ones for plasma exchange that have been validated with experimental data (Randerson et al., 1982, Artif. Organs, 6, 43-49). We also show that the algebraic differential equations are forward Euler discretizations of the delay differential equations, with timesteps equal to transit times through model compartments. Numerical simulations are performed to compare different model types, to investigate the impact of plasma device port switching on the efficiency of the exchange process, and to study the sensitivity of the models to their parameters.","Puelz, Charles; Danial, Zach; Raval, Jay S; Marinaro, Jonathan L; Griffith, Boyce E; Peskin, Charles S",Mathematical medicine and biology : a journal of the IMA,103,33

METHODS One hundred forty-seven consecutive patients scheduled for laparoscopic surgery for sigmoid colon and rectal cancer between April 2010 and December 2010 were classified into one of the two groups according to the site of the minilaparotomy: a transumbilical incision group (n = 92) and a left lower transverse incision group (n = 55). RESULTS Demographic data, operation time, estimated blood loss, frequency of transfusion, size of the tumor, number of harvested lymph nodes, distal resection margins, time to first flatus, and length of hospital stay were similar between the two groups. Postoperative pain scores were also similar between the two groups. The length of the minilaparotomy incision was shorter in the transumbilical group than the left lower transverse group at operation (mean, 4.6 vs. 6.2 cm, p = 0.000). The postoperative mean satisfaction score was higher in the transumbilical group, but this was not statistically significant (7.6 vs. 7.1, p = 0.224). Fourteen patients in the transumbilical group and 7 patients in the left lower transverse group developed wound-related complications (p = 0.810), including two cases of incisional hernia, both in the transumbilical group. High body mass index (≥25 kg/m(2)) and longer operative time (≥180 min) were risk factors for wound complications on univariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS Transumbilical minilaparotomy in laparoscopic colorectal surgery is a good alternative approach with acceptable wound complications.","Lim, S W; Huh, J W; Kim, Y J; Kim, H R",Techniques in coloproctology,103,28

Successful recanalization was achieved in 74.5% of endocarditis patients compared to 87.5% of controls (p=0.039). Intracranial hemorrhage rates were comparable (30.9% versus 21.6%, p=0.175). Good functional outcome was 20.0% in patients with IE compared to 43.3% in matched patients (p=0.006) with a significantly higher mortality (60.0% versus 28.8%, p<0.001). IE was strongly associated with poor outcome (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11-0.87, p=0.03 for good outcome) and mortality (OR 4.49, 95% CI 1.80-10.68, p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS Although MT results in high successful recanalization rates with acceptable safety profile, patients with LVO stroke due to IE have a poor outcome.","Feil, Katharina; Küpper, Clemens; Tiedt, Steffen; Dimitriadis, Konstantinos; Herzberg, Moriz; Dorn, Franziska; Liebig, Thomas; Dieterich, Marianne; Kellert, Lars",European journal of neurology,103,16

A homodimeric flavoprotein of 216 residues, it catalyses the reduction of nitroaromatics to cytotoxic hydroxylamines by NADH and NADPH and also the reduction of quinones to hydroxyquinones. Its role in vivo is not known but it is postulated to be involved in reducing oxidative stress. The crystal structures of the wild type protein and several homologues have been determined in the absence and presence of ligands, including nicotinate as a mimic of the headpiece of the nicotinamide cofactors. There is little effect on the overall structure of the protein on binding ligands, but, from the B factors, there appears to be a decrease in mobility of 2 helices near the active site. As a first step towards examining the dynamics of the protein in solution with and without ligand, we have assigned the backbone 13C, 15N, and 1HN resonances of NfsB and examined the effect of the binding of nicotinate on the amide 15N, and 1HN shifts.","Hyde, Eva I; Chau, Alex Ka-Wing; Smith, Lorna J",Biomolecular NMR assignments,103,17

Material and Methods A total of 240 patients who underwent elective, primary, unilateral inguinal hernia operation between April 2011 and September 2012 were divided into two randomized groups. The first group underwent MIP repair and the second group underwent TEP repair. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Sheffield Scale (SS) were used to evaluate chronic pain. Results In all, 225 (95%) of the patients completed follow-up and were included in analyses. A significant difference was not detected between groups in terms of demographics, operative time, or intraoperative, early, or late complications. Length of time before return to work was significantly shorter in the TEP group (p <0.001). Recurrence was seen in 1 (0.88%) patient in the MIP group and 1 (0.89%) patient in the TEP group (p= 0.993). Evaluation of chronic pain revealed no significant difference between groups in VAS and SS values at postoperative 6th, 12th, and 24th months. Conclusion In conclusion, it was observed that MIP repair for inguinal hernia has all of the advantages of preperitoneal repair and eliminates disadvantages of TEP repair. MIP technique is as safe as TEP repair and has similar qualities in terms of chronic pain, even though it is an open intervention.","Aksoy, Nergis; Arslan, Kemal; Doğru, Osman; Karahan, Ömer; Eryılmaz, Mehmet Ali",Turkish journal of surgery,103,6

METHODS Retrospective cohort study using ambulance electronic patient care records from rural-dwelling older adults (≥65 years old) who requested emergency ambulance attendance during 2017. RESULTS A total of 84 785 older adults requested emergency ambulance attendance, representing a rate of 278 per 1000 population aged ≥65 years. More than 10% of calls were to residential aged care homes. Medical complaints and trauma accounted for 69% and 18% of attendances, respectively. The predominant cause of trauma was ground-level falls. Common reasons for call-outs were for pain (17.5%), respiratory problems (9.7%) and cardiovascular problems (8.5%). Increased demand was associated with increasing age and winter months.

Few data regarding factors that increase the risk of infection are available. Our study aimed to evaluate all people living in retirement homes (PLRNH) and identify factors that could increase infection risk in a close community. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective study enrolling all PLRNH, where at least one SARS-CoV-2 infected person was present. Variables were compared with Student's t-test or Pearson chi-square test as appropriate. Uni- and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate variables' influence on the infection. RESULTS We included 452 PLRNH; 144 (31.7%) were male, with a mean age of 82.2±8.6 years. People with a positive swab for SARS-CoV-2 were 306 (67.4%). A significant difference between SARS-CoV-2 infected and not infected was observed in the percentage of those receiving chronic treatment with Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (18.6% vs. 9.5%, p=0.012). On the contrary, there was no difference in the proportion of those receiving ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) (21.2% vs. 23.6%, p=0.562). At multivariate analysis, people with mental illness and cancer had an increased risk of being infected. Furthermore, receiving ARBs as a chronic treatment was an independent predictor of infection risk [OR 1.95 (95% CI 1.03-3.72) p=0.041]. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that, in close communities, such as retirement nursing homes, the receipt of ARBs increased the risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, before changing an important chronic treatment in a fragile population, such as the elderly living in retirement nursing homes, clinicians should carefully evaluate the risk-benefit ratio.","De Vito, A; Geremia, N; Princic, E; Fanelli, C; Panu Napodano, C M; Muredda, A A; Fiore, V; Maida, I; Fois, A G; Babudieri, S; Madeddu, G",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,103,1

In rodents, jararhagin induces nociceptive behaviors that correlate with an increase in peripheral cytokine levels. However, the role of the spinal cord glia in pain processing after peripheral stimulus of jararhagin has not been investigated. Aiming to explore this proposal, mice received intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of jararhagin and the following parameters were evaluated: hyperalgesia, spinal cord TNF-α, IL-1β levels, and CX3CR1, GFAP and p-NFκB activation. The effects of intrathecal (i.t.) injection of TNF-α soluble receptor (etanercept), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), and inhibitors of NFκB (PDTC), microglia (minocycline) and astrocytes (α-aminoadipate) were investigated. Jararhagin inoculation induced cytokine production (TNF-α and IL-1β) in the spinal cord, which was reduced by treatment with PDTC (40% and 50%, respectively). Jararhagin mechanical hyperalgesia and cytokine production were inhibited by treatment with etanercept (67%), IL-1Ra (60%), PDTC (70%), minocycline (60%) and α-aminoadipate (45%). Furthermore, jararhagin induced an increase in p-NFκB, CX3CR1 and GFAP detection in the spinal cord indicating activation of NFκB, microglia and astrocytes. These results demonstrate for the first time that jararhagin-induced mechanical hyperalgesia is dependent on spinal cord activation of glial cells, consequent NFκB activation, and cytokine production in mice.","Ferraz, Camila R; Carvalho, Thacyana T; Fattori, Victor; Saraiva-Santos, Telma; Pinho-Ribeiro, Felipe A; Borghi, Sergio M; Manchope, Marília F; Zaninelli, Tiago H; Cunha, Thiago M; Casagrande, Rubia; Clissa, Patricia B; Verri, Waldiceu A",International journal of biological macromolecules,103,24

One of the first steps in this field is the need to study telepractice among Speech and Language Pathologists (SLPs). However, there is currently no specific instrument to measure telepractice in SLP to achieve this aim. The present study was conducted to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of a questionnaire to investigate telepractice among SLPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study comprised of two stages: (1) development of the questionnaire according to an in-depth literature review and (2) evaluation of the validity and reliability of the questionnaire. The content validity of the instrument was determined by 10 experts in the field of SLP. To check the face validity of the questionnaire, 10 SLPs were interviewed and their opinions were incorporated in the questionnaire. A total of 221 SLPs completed the questionnaire to determine the construct validity and the internal consistency. To evaluate the test-retest reliability, 30 SLPs completed the questionnaire twice with two weeks of interval. RESULTS The final version of the questionnaire comprised of three sections and 31 items. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients for different sections of the questionnaire ranged between 0.902 and 0.92 and the Intra-class Correlation coefficients of the sections were found to be between 0.9 and 0.96 in the test-retest reliability. CONCLUSIONS The questionnaire developed in the study is a valid and reliable scale to measure telepractice among SLPs for educational or research purposes.","Mansuri, Banafshe; Tohidast, Seyed Abolfazl; Choubineh, Mehran; Bagheri, Rasool; Azimi, Hadi","Logopedics, phoniatrics, vocology",103,28

BACKGROUND Nurses are on the front lines of disaster and emergency response; however, they report not feeling confident about their disaster preparedness. METHODS Participants included 234 nurses working at a general hospital in Korea. Emergency code awareness was measured by recognition of and self-confidence in eight emergency codes, and disaster nursing competencies were measured using the Disaster Nursing Preparedness Response Competency Scale. Data were collected from October 17-23, 2019. RESULTS The recognition rate of emergency codes was 87.4%, whereas the level of self-confidence was 3.30 out of 5. Nurses scored 2.98 out of 5 on disaster preparedness competencies and 3.37 out of 5 on disaster response competencies. Emergency code recognition was positively correlated with self-confidence and disaster nursing competencies (p < .05). CONCLUSION Higher recognition of emergency codes among clinical nurses was associated with higher self-confidence and disaster nursing competencies. Further studies need to develop strategies to improve nurses' awareness and confidence concerning emergency codes. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT Nurse managers should pay attention to provide more opportunities for disaster education to improve nurses' self-confidence and disaster nursing competencies.","Jeong, Suhee; Lee, Ogcheol",Journal of nursing management,103,28

We aimed to develop predictive equations for estimating fat-free mass (FFM) from bioelectrical impedance (BIA) and anthropometry using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as reference method using data from 99 healthy 3-year-old Danish children. Predictive equations were derived from two multiple linear regression models, a comprehensive model (height(2)/resistance (RI), six anthropometric measurements) and a simple model (RI, height, weight). Their uncertainty was quantified by means of 10-fold cross-validation approach. Prediction error of FFM was 3.0% for both equations (root mean square error: 360 and 356 g, respectively). The derived equations produced BIA-based prediction of FFM and FM near DXA scan results. We suggest that the predictive equations can be applied in similar population samples aged 2-4 years. The derived equations may prove useful for studies linking body composition to early risk factors and early onset of obesity.","Ejlerskov, Katrine T; Jensen, Signe M; Christensen, Line B; Ritz, Christian; Michaelsen, Kim F; Mølgaard, Christian",Scientific reports,103,1

The study aimed to identify therapeutic approaches and drugs that can potentially be used as interventions in Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) management. A systematic scoping review was conducted. Articles reporting clinical evidence of therapeutic management of COVID-19 were selected from three different research databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct). From the database search, 31 articles were selected based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. This review paper showed that remdesivir and ivermectin significantly reduced viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) activity. On the other hand, convalescent plasma (CP) significantly improved COVID-19 clinical symptoms. Additionally, the use of corticosteroid increased survival rates in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Findings also indicated that both hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir were effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, lopinavir-ritonavir combination was not effective against COVID-19. Finally, ribavirin, galidesivir, and sofosbuvir showed potential therapeutic benefit in treating COVID-19, but there is a lack of clinical evidence on their effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2.

HFNC has a number of physiological effects. Although FIO2 is considered to be constant, because HFNC is an open system, FIO2 varies according to inspiratory flow, tidal volume (VT), and HFNC gas flow. We investigated the influence of HFNC gas flow and other respiratory parameters on FIO2 during HFNC. METHODS We evaluated an HFNC system and, for comparison, a conventional oxygen therapy system. The HFNC apparatus was composed of an air/oxygen blender, a heated humidifier, an inspiratory limb, and small, medium, and large nasal prongs. HFNC gas flow was set at 20, 40, and 60 L/min, and FIO2 was set at 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7. We measured FIO2 for 1-min intervals using an oxygen analyzer and extracted data for the final 3 breaths of each interval. Spontaneous breathing was simulated using a mechanical ventilator connected to the muscle compartment of a model lung. The lung compartment passively moved with the muscle compartment, thus inspiring ambient air via a ventilator limb. With a decelerating flow waveform, simulated VT was set at 300, 500, and 700 mL, breathing frequency at 10 and 20 breaths/min, and inspiratory time at 1.0 s. RESULTS With HFNC gas flow of 20 and 40 L/min, at all set FIO2 values, inspiratory oxygen concentration varied with VT (P < .001). As the set value for FIO2 increased, the difference between set FIO2 and measured FIO2 increased. Neither breathing frequency nor prong size influenced FIO2 . CONCLUSIONS During HFNC with simulated spontaneous breathing, when HFNC gas flow was 60 L/min, measured FIO2 was similar to set FIO2 at 0.3 and 0.5, whereas at 0.7, as VT increased, measured FIO2 decreased slightly. However, at 20 or 40 L/min, changes in VT related with deviation from set FIO2 .","Chikata, Yusuke; Onodera, Mutsuo; Oto, Jun; Nishimura, Masaji",Respiratory care,103,24

Methods: Cross-sectional population-based study comprising 643 adults (39.6 ± 11.1 years, 44.9% men) from Florianópolis, Southern Brazil. Muscle strength was assessed by handgrip strength. Health variables included were systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), waist circumference (WC), carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), total cholesterol (CHOL), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TRG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR). Participants were grouped into three health status categories: 1) healthy (without CVD and risk for CVD); 2) at risk for CVD (obesity, high blood pressure and hyperglycemia); 3) with CVD. Multiple linear regression adjusted for confounding factors was used. Results: Muscle strength was inversely associated with IMT (β = -0.02, SE: 0.03), CHOL (β = -0.14, SE: 0.02) and HbA1c (β = -0.01, SE: 0.10), and directly associated with SBP (β = 0.16, SE: 0.06) and WC (β = 0.02, SE: 0.03). Among adults with CVD, muscle strength was inversely associated with IMT (p < 0.05). Higher muscle strength was directly associated with SBP among healthy adults (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The main finding of the present study indicated that among individuals with CVD, muscle strength was associated with lower IMT values.","de Lima, Tiago Rodrigues; González-Chica, David Alejandro; Franco Moreno, Yara Maria; Santos Silva, Diego Augusto",The Physician and sportsmedicine,103,7

Drug repurposing offers an innovative approach in this context. We report here new findings on the in silico potential of several antimalarial drugs for repurposing against COVID-19. We conducted analyses by docking the compounds against two SARS-CoV-2-specific targets: (1) the receptor binding domain spike protein and (2) the main protease of the virus (MPro) using the Schrödinger software. Importantly, the docking analysis revealed that doxycycline (DOX) showed the most effective binding to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, whereas halofantrine and mefloquine bound effectively with the main protease among the antimalarial drugs evaluated in the present study. The in silico approach reported here suggested that DOX could potentially be a good candidate for repurposing for COVID-19. In contrast, to decipher the actual potential of DOX and halofantrine against COVID-19, further in vitro and in vivo studies are called for.

Postoperative pain is an undesirable clinical outcome impairing daily activity of 22.5% of patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate postoperative acute and chronic pain via inflammatory markers as an objective assessment following tacks or glue mesh fixation in TEP repair. METHODS Sixty-six (66) patients with unilateral uncomplicated inguinal hernia were randomized into 34 patients in the tacker and 32 patients in cyanoacrylate glue mesh fixation in TEP repair. The extent of surgical trauma was evaluated by measuring inflammatory markers of C-reactive protein, white blood cell count at 48 h, and ESR at 3 months postoperatively. Postoperative acute and chronic pain was assessed by recording the visual analogue scale scores and surgical complications were recorded over 3 months of the study period. RESULTS The median CRP and WBC levels at postoperative 48 h in both groups raised significantly from the baseline values (p < 0.05), however, did not differ significantly between the two study groups at 48 h (p > 0.05). The median ESR level increased significantly at 3 months postoperatively from baseline in the glue mesh fixation group only (p < 0.05), however, did not differ significantly between the two study groups (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference for VAS scores at all timelines between the tacker and glue mesh fixation group (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION Cyanoacrylate glue mesh fixation technique as an alternative method to mechanical fixation in TEP repair is comparable to tacker and can be considered to be safe and feasible.","Liew, W; Wai, Y Y; Kosai, N R; Gendeh, H S",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,103,16

Here, we tested the hypothesis that changes in fixation stability induced by peripheral viewing contribute to crowding in peripheral vision by increasing positional uncertainty. We first assessed whether fixation was less stable during peripheral versus central (foveal) viewing for both crowded and uncrowded stimuli. We then tested whether fixation stability during peripheral viewing was associated with the extent of crowding. Fourteen participants performed a tumbling E orientation discrimination task at three different eccentricities (0°, 5°, 10°). The target was presented with or without flankers. Fixational eye movements were measured using an infrared video-based eyetracker. A central fixation cross was provided for the two peripheral viewing conditions, and optotype size was scaled for each eccentricity. Discrimination of appropriately scaled uncrowded stimuli was unaffected by eccentricity, whereas discrimination of crowded stimuli deteriorated dramatically with eccentricity, despite scaling. Both crowded and uncrowded peripheral stimuli were associated with reduced fixation stability, increased microsaccadic amplitude, and a greater proportion of horizontal microsaccades relative to centrally presented stimuli. However, these effects were not associated with the magnitude of crowding. This suggests that reduced fixation stability due to peripheral viewing does not contribute to crowding in peripheral vision.","Raveendran, Rajkumar Nallour; Krishnan, Arun Kumar; Thompson, Benjamin",Journal of vision,103,19

As obligate intracellular parasites, many viruses acquire m6A methylation in their RNAs. However, the biological functions of viral m6A methylation are poorly understood. Here, we found that viral m6A methylation serves as a molecular marker for host innate immunity to discriminate self from nonself RNA and that this novel biological function of viral m6A methylation is universally conserved in several families in non-segmented negative-sense (NNS) RNA viruses. Using m6A methyltransferase (METTL3)-knockout cells, we produced m6A-deficient virion RNA from the representative members of the families Pneumoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae and found that these m6A-deficient viral RNAs triggered significantly higher levels of type I interferon compared to the m6A-sufficient viral RNAs, in a RIG-I dependent manner. Reconstitution of the RIG-I pathway revealed that m6A-deficient virion RNA induced higher expression of RIG-I, bound to RIG-I more efficiently, enhanced RIG-I ubiquitination, and facilitated RIG-I conformational rearrangement and oligomerization. Furthermore, the m6A binding protein YTHDF2 is essential for suppression of type I interferon signaling pathway included by virion RNA. Collectively, our results suggest that several families in NNS RNA viruses acquire m6A in viral RNA as a common strategy to evade host innate immunity.IMPORTANCE The non-segmented negative-sense (NNS) RNA viruses share many common replication and gene expression strategies. There is no vaccine or antiviral drugs for many of these viruses. We found that representative members in the families of Pneumoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae in NNS RNA viruses acquire m6A methylation in their genome and antigenome as a means to escape the recognition by host innate immunity via a RIG-I dependent signaling pathway. Viral RNA lacking m6A methylation induces a significantly higher type I interferon compared to m6A sufficient viral RNA. In addition to uncovering m6A methylation as a common mechanism for many NNS RNA viruses to evade host innate immunity, this study discovered a novel strategy to enhance type I interferon responses, which may have important applications in vaccine development, as a robust innate immunity will likely promote the subsequent adaptive immunity.","Lu, Mijia; Xue, Miaoge; Wang, Hai-Tao; Kairis, Elizabeth L; Ahmad, Sadeem; Wei, Jiangbo; Zhang, Zijie; Zhang, Yuexiu; Gao, Youling; Garcin, Dominique; Peeples, Mark E; Sharma, Amit; Hur, Sun; He, Chuan; Li, Jianrong",Journal of virology,103,16

The aim of our investigation was to assess different surgical approaches for LESS, stratifying by weight. SUBJECTS AND METHODS From March 2010 to April 2012 LESS was performed in 42 children. Children weighing below 10 kg underwent LESS through an umbilical incision using two 3-mm trocars and one 5-mm trocar. Patients above 10 kg were operated on using a metal multiuse single-site single port (X-Cone; Karl Storz Endoskope, Tuttlingen, Germany). Conventional straight laparoscopic instruments were used in all cases. RESULTS Mean age at operation was 100 months (range, 0.25-207 months), and mean weight was 27 kg (range, 3.1-82 kg). Median operating time was 74 minutes (range, 36-300 minutes). Eighteen children underwent LESS using two 3-mm trocars and one 5-mm trocar; 1 case required two 5-mm trocars and one 10-mm trocar. Twenty-three patients were operated on with the multiuse device. All operations were carried out safely in a standard laparoscopic transperitoneal technique with full achievement of the surgical target. In none of the patients was an intraoperative complication noticed. Postoperatively two complications were noted, which resolved spontaneously. CONCLUSIONS LESS for pediatric patients can be done safely and efficiently with even less trauma than in conventional laparoscopy irrespective of age and weight. However, different surgical approaches have to be considered as disposable single-site ports are not available for infants and small children. To decrease operative expenses, conventional multiuse trocars and a multiuse single-site port were used with conventional laparoscopic instruments.","Szavay, Philipp O; Luithle, Tobias; Nagel, Carmen; Fuchs, Joerg",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Here, we conducted diagnostic multiplex PCR assay and meta-omics analysis (16S rRNA gene-based metataxonomics and untargeted transcriptional profiling) of rectal content of normal and diarrheic beef calves (n = 111). In the diarrheic calf gut, we detected both microbial compositional dysbiosis (i.e., increased abundances of the family Enterobacteriaceae members and their lytic bacteriophages) and functional dysbiosis (i.e., elevated levels of aerobic respiration and virulence potential). The calf diarrheic transcriptome mirrored the gene expression of the bovine host and was enriched in cellular pathways of sulfur metabolism, innate immunity, and gut motility. We then isolated 12 nontoxigenic Enterobacteriaceae strains from the gut of diarrheic calves.

Although the exact etiopathogenesis of SLE is still enigmatic, it has been well demonstrated that a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors trigger a disturbance in immune responses and thereby participate in the development of this condition. Almost all available therapeutic strategies in SLE are primarily based on the administration of immunosuppressive drugs and are not curative.

Rubicon induces antimicrobial responses upon Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation and functions as a feedback inhibitor to prevent unbalanced proinflammatory responses depending on dectin-1 signaling. However, the role played by Rubicon during antiviral immune responses, particularly the type I interferon (IFN) responses, remains largely unknown. Here, we report that Rubicon acts as a negative regulator for virus-triggered IFN signaling. Knockdown of Rubicon promoted type I interferon signaling and inhibited virus replication, while overexpression of Rubicon had the opposite effect. Rubicon specifically interacts with the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) association domain (IAD) of IRF3, and this interaction leads to inhibition of the dimerization of IRF3, which negatively regulates IFN-mediated antiviral response. Thus, our findings suggest the novel additional role of Rubicon as a negative regulator that inhibits the IFN signaling and cellular antiviral responses, providing a novel cellular mechanism of IRF3 inhibition.IMPORTANCE The type I IFN system is a critical innate immune response that protects organisms against virus infection. However, type I IFN signaling must be tightly regulated to avoid excessive production of IFNs. Hence, negative regulatory mechanisms for type I IFN signaling are important, and to date, several related molecules have been identified. Here, we show that Rubicon is a major negative regulator of type I IFN signaling, and unlike previous reports of cellular molecules that inhibit IRF3 activation via proteasomal degradation or dephosphorylation of IRF3, we show that Rubicon interacts with IRF3 and that ultimately this interaction leads to inhibition of the dimerization of IRF3. Thus, we identified a novel negative regulator of type I IFN signaling pathways and a novel cellular mechanism of IRF3 inhibition. The results of this study will increase our understanding of the role of negative-feedback mechanisms that regulate type I IFN signaling and maintain immune homeostasis.","Kim, Jae-Hoon; Kim, Tae-Hwan; Lee, Hyun-Cheol; Nikapitiya, Chamilani; Uddin, Md Bashir; Park, Min-Eun; Pathinayake, Prabuddha; Lee, Eun Seo; Chathuranga, Kiramage; Herath, Thilina U B; Chathuranga, W A Gayan; Lee, Jong-Soo",Journal of virology,103,5

A parallel development toward less invasive approaches has occurred in the field of surgery, interventional radiology, and endoscopy. Minimally invasive techniques provide unquestionable benefits to patients in terms of postoperative outcome. However, those techniques are not intuitive, and extensive training is required to overcome the inherent challenges and to be proficient and consequently to achieve a steep learning curve. Technologies have been developed by computer science and robotics departments, which might improve minimally invasive techniques. A new concept of cyber therapies is emerging through the development of computer and robotic sciences aiming at human-machine integration. Additionally, the convergence of surgery, endoscopy, and interventional radiology toward a hybrid therapeutic modality, namely image-guided minimally invasive procedures, holds promises insofar as they could well maximize benefits in terms of efficacy and iatrogenic impact. In the present manuscript, the mainstays of these new paradigm developments are briefly outlined in light of our experience and vision of the future.","Marescaux, Jacques; Diana, Michele",World journal of surgery,103,1

Currently, no reference values exist for ROTEM assays in full-term and pre-term neonates. Our aim was to establish reference ranges for standard extrinsically activated ROTEM assay (EXTEM) in arterial blood samples of healthy full-term and pre-term neonates. METHODS In the present study, EXTEM assay was performed in 198 full-term (≥37 weeks' gestation) and 84 pre-term infants (<37 weeks' gestation) using peripheral arterial whole blood samples. RESULTS Median values and reference ranges (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) for the following main parameters of EXTEM assay were determined in full-term infants: clotting time (seconds), 41 (range, 25.9-78); clot formation time (seconds), 70 (range, 40-165.2); maximum clot firmness (mm), 66 (range, 41-84.1); lysis index at 60 min (LI60, %), 97 (range, 85-100). The only parameter with a statistically significant difference between full-term and pre-term neonates was LI60 (p=0.006). Furthermore, it was inversely correlated with gestational age (p=0.002) and birth weight (p=0.016) in pre-term neonates. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, an enhanced fibrinolytic activity in pre-term neonates was noted. For most EXTEM assay parameters, reference ranges obtained from arterial newborn blood samples were comparable with the respective values from studies using cord blood. Modified reagents, small size samples, timing of sampling, and different kind of samples might account for any discrepancies among similar studies. Reference values hereby provided can be used in future studies.","Sokou, Rozeta; Foudoulaki-Paparizos, Leontini; Lytras, Theodore; Konstantinidi, Aikaterini; Theodoraki, Martha; Lambadaridis, Ioannis; Gounaris, Antonis; Valsami, Serena; Politou, Marianna; Gialeraki, Argyri; Nikolopoulos, Georgios K; Iacovidou, Nicoletta; Bonovas, Stefanos; Tsantes, Argirios E",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,103,1

Heart transplantation and ventricular assist device (VAD) support represent the only available lifelines for end stage disease. In the context of donor organ shortage, the future role of VAD as destination therapy is emerging. Yet, major drawbacks are connected to the long-term implantation of current devices. Poor VAD hemocompatibility exposes the patient to life-threatening events, including haemorrhagic syndromes and thrombosis. Here, we introduce a new concept of artificial support, the Hybrid Membrane VAD, as a first-of-its-kind pump prototype enabling physiological blood propulsion through the cyclic actuation of a hyperelastic membrane, enabling the protection from the thrombogenic interaction between blood and the implant materials. The centre of the luminal membrane surface displays a rationally-developed surface topography interfering with flow to support a living endothelium. The precast cell layer survives to a range of dynamically changing pump actuating conditions i.e., actuation frequency from 1 to 4 Hz, stroke volume from 12 to 30 mL, and support duration up to 313 min, which are tested both in vitro and in vivo, ensuring the full retention of tissue integrity and connectivity under challenging conditions. In summary, the presented results constitute a proof of principle for the Hybrid Membrane VAD concept and represent the basis for its future development towards clinical validation.","Ferrari, Aldo; Giampietro, Costanza; Bachmann, Björn; Bernardi, Laura; Bezuidenhhout, Deon; Ermanni, Paolo; Hopf, Raoul; Kitz, Sarah; Kress, Gerald; Loosli, Christian; Marina, Vita; Meboldt, Mirko; Pellegrini, Giovanni; Poulikakos, Dimos; Rebholz, Mathias; Schmid Daners, Marianne; Schmidt, Tanja; Starck, Christoph; Stefopoulos, Georgios; Sündermann, Simon; Thamsen, Bente; Zilla, Peter; Potapov, Evgenij; Falk, Volkmar; Mazza, Edoardo",Annals of biomedical engineering,103,1

Both pre- and postsynaptic forms of homeostasis are important, but their relative impact on fidelity is unknown. To address this issue, we studied auditory nerve synapses onto bushy cells in the cochlear nucleus of mice of both sexes. These synapses undergo bidirectional pre- and postsynaptic homeostatic changes with increased and decreased acoustic stimulation. We found that both young and mature synapses exhibit similar activity-dependent changes in short-term depression. Experiments using chelators and imaging both indicated that presynaptic Ca2+ influx decreased after noise exposure, and increased after ligating the ear canal. By contrast, Ca2+ cooperativity was unaffected. Experiments using specific antagonists suggest that occlusion leads to changes in the Ca2+ channel subtypes driving neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, dynamic-clamp experiments revealed that spike fidelity primarily depended on changes in presynaptic depression, with some contribution from changes in postsynaptic intrinsic properties. These experiments indicate that presynaptic Ca2+ influx is homeostatically regulated in vivo to enhance synaptic fidelity.Significance StatementHomeostatic mechanisms in synapses maintain stable function in the face of different levels of activity. Both juvenile and mature auditory nerve synapses onto bushy cells modify short-term depression in different acoustic environments, which raises the question of what the underlying presynaptic mechanisms are and the relative importance of pre- and postsynaptic contributions to the faithful transfer of information. Changes in short-term depression under different acoustic conditions were a result of changes in presynaptic Ca2+ influx. Spike fidelity was affected by both presynaptic and postsynaptic changes after ear-occlusion and was only affected by presynaptic changes after noise-rearing. These findings are important for understanding regulation of auditory synapses under normal conditions and also in disorders following noise exposure or conductive hearing loss.","Zhuang, Xiaowen; Wong, Nicole F; Sun, Wei; Xu-Friedman, Matthew A",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,103,16

Fluid dynamics and large molecule distribution were described by the coupling of mass conservation's and Fick's laws with continuity and momentum equations for a Newtonian incompressible fluid in a 3D unsteady analysis. Two injection sites were analyzed, in both the mixing effect of a 50° periodic saccade leads to uniform drug distribution in 30 s of simulation, the initial bolus site being left after 3 s of simulation. In absence of saccadic movements, the dominant transport contribution is the diffusive one and large molecules hardly reach their uniform distribution inside the vitreous cavity. A model describing the intravitreal distribution of large molecules in presence of saccades was developed, improving the understanding of drug transport mechanism after an intravitreal injection and highlighting how advection contribution enhances its distribution in the vitreous chamber.","Ferroni, Marco; De Gaetano, Francesco; Cereda, Matteo Giuseppe; Boschetti, Federica",Medical engineering & physics,103,5

Many studies have modeled the efficiency gains of specimen pooling, but few have systematically evaluated the dilution effect of pooling on the sensitivity of tests. Using the frequency distribution of Ct values of our first 838 SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens, we modeled 100 specimens on the same frequency distribution. Given this distribution, we then tested dilutions of 1:5, 1:10, and 1:50 to find the percentage of specimens positive at each Ct value with each pool size. Using the frequency distribution and the percentage of specimens positive at each Ct value, we estimate that pools of 5 lead to 93% sensitivity, pools of 10 lead to 91% sensitivity, and pools of 50 lead to 81% sensitivity. Pools of 5 and 10 lead to some specimens with Ct values of ≥32 becoming negative, while pools of 50 lead to some specimens with Ct values of ≥28 becoming negative. These sensitivity estimates can inform laboratories seeking to implement pooling approaches as they seek to balance test efficiency with sensitivity. This article is protected by copyright.

The authors hypothesized that even though children have highly vasoreactive arteries, because of a robust cerebral collateral blood flow, they rarely develop symptomatic CV. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed their university hospital's neurointerventional database for children (that is, patients ≤ 18 years) who were examined or treated for aneurysmal or traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) during the period 1990-2013. Images from digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were analyzed for the extent of CV and collateralization of the cerebral circulation. Results from transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography were correlated with those from DSA. Cerebral vasospasm on TCD ultrasonography was defined according to criteria developed for adults. Clinical outcomes of CV were assessed with the pediatric modified Rankin Scale (mRS). RESULTS Among 37 children (21 boys and 16 girls ranging in age from 8 months to 18 years) showing symptoms of an aneurysmal SAH (comprising 32 aneurysms and 5 traumatic pseudoaneurysms), 17 (46%) had CV confirmed by DSA; CV was mild in 21% of these children, moderate in 50%, and severe in 29%. Only 3 children exhibited symptomatic CV, all of whom had poor collateralization of cerebral vessels. Among the 14 asymptomatic children, 10 (71%) showed some degree of vessel collateralization. Among 16 children for whom TCD data were available that could be correlated with the DSA findings, 13 (81%) had CV according to TCD criteria. The sensitivity and specificity of TCD ultrasonography for diagnosing CV were 95% and 59%, respectively. The time to CV onset detected by TCD ultrasonography was 5 ± 3 days (range 2-10 days). Twenty-five (68%) of the children had good long-term outcomes (that is, had mRS scores of 0-2). CONCLUSIONS Children have a relatively high incidence of angiographically detectable, moderate-to-severe CV. Children rarely develop symptomatic CV and have good long-term outcomes, perhaps due to robust cerebral collateral blood flow. Criteria developed for detecting CV with TCD ultrasonography in adults overestimate the prevalence of CV in children. Larger studies are needed to define TCD ultrasonography-based CV criteria for children.","Moftakhar, Parham; Cooke, Daniel L; Fullerton, Heather J; Ko, Nerissa U; Amans, Matthew R; Narvid, Jared A; Dowd, Christopher F; Higashida, Randall T; Halbach, Van V; Hetts, Steven W",Journal of neurosurgery.

In general, most species have developed mechanisms to minimize inbreeding such as dispersal and kin avoidance behavior. In the eusocial Hymenoptera, related individuals typically share a common nest and have relatively short mating periods, this could lead to inbreeding, and because of their single-locus complementary sex determination system, it may generate diploid males that could result in infertile triploid progeny representing a cost for the colony. Vespula germanica, is an eusocial wasp that has invaded many parts of the world, despite likely facing a reduced genetic pool during the arrival phases. We ask whether male wasp display specific aggregation behavior that favors genetic diversity, key to reduce inbreeding. Through a set of laboratory experiments, we investigated the effects of drone nestmateship and density on the aggregation behavior of V. germanica drones. We show that drones avoid aggregating with their nestmates at all densities while non-nestmates are avoided only at high densities. This suggests that lek genetic diversity and density could be regulated through drone behavior and in the long run minimize inbreeding favoring invasion success.","Masciocchi, Maité; Angeletti, Bárbara; Corley, Juan C; Martínez, Andrés S",Scientific reports,103,23

In the present study, the effects of lentivirus‑mediated transfection of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) with microRNA (miR)‑26a on bone regeneration were investigated in a mouse bone defect repair model. Marker of proliferation Ki67 (Ki67) staining was employed to detect the cell proliferation capacity and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining was used to investigate osteogenic differentiation. A mouse model of cranial bone defects was established. β‑tricalcium phosphate biomaterials co‑cultured with the transfected BMSCs were implanted into the defect areas of mouse models. Micro‑computed tomography, and hematoxylin and eosin and toluidine blue staining, were used to detect bone regeneration in the defect areas and the degradation of scaffolds. miR‑26a expression, and the mRNA and protein expression of osteogenesis‑associated cytokines, were detected using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. Separated and cultured BMSCs highly expressed CD29 and CD105, but not CD34 and CD45, as determined by flow cytometry. miR‑26a expression and the positive cell rate of Ki67 and ALP staining in BMSCs transfected with pLVTHM‑miR‑26a were increased. The BMSC and negative control‑transfected BMSC groups exhibited increased bone regeneration in the defect areas, increased bone volume of newly formed bones, and elevated mRNA and protein expression of runt‑related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and osteocalcin (OC), compared with the blank group. However, the miR‑26a‑transfected BMSC group exhibited further increases in bone regeneration and the volume of newly formed bones, and further elevations of the mRNA and protein expression levels of Runx2 and OC. The present findings demonstrated that lentivirus‑mediated modification of BMSCs enhanced bone regeneration during the repair of cranial bone defects in mice.","Liu, Zhi; Chang, Hong; Hou, Yihong; Wang, Yu; Zhou, Zhiqiang; Wang, Ming; Huang, Zhidong; Yu, Bin",Molecular medicine reports,103,24

This paper reports a survey that was undertaken by the European Association for Palliative Care Task Force on mapping palliative care provision for prisoners in Europe. The Task Force was established to begin to address the gap in research knowledge by exploring prison systems and care provision across different countries. METHODS The survey, developed by the Task Force Steering Committee, consisted of 40 questions in six sections. It was completed through online searches; only data that were publicly available on the internet were included. Numerical data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and thematic comparisons were made of free-text data. FINDINGS The survey was completed for eight countries: Australia, Belgium, Czech Republic, England and Wales, France, Portugal, Scotland and Slovakia. Three main findings are reported here: healthcare and palliative care provision in prisons, deaths in custody and compassionate release. Despite increasing numbers of older prisoners, relatively few prisons provide inpatient care, and only one country has any prisons that provide dedicated palliative care services. Early release on compassionate grounds is extremely rare in most countries. CONCLUSION For the principle of equivalence to be adhered to, facilities for sick and dying prisoners need to be improved, or many more people need to be released on compassionate grounds at the end of life. This mapping study has identified key issues in relation to palliative care in prison and provides the basis for further international research.","Turner, Mary; Chassagne, Aline; Capelas, Manuel Luis; Chambaere, Kenneth; Panozzo, Stacey; Teves, Carla Marinho; Riegler, Edith",BMJ supportive & palliative care,103,1

A successful match into an ophthalmology residency was achieved by 144 (83.7%) applicants. Applicants applied to (mean ± SD) 79.7 ± 22.8 ophthalmology residency programs, received 13.1 ± 8.9 invitations to interview, and attended 11.1 ± 5.8 interviews. Most applicants (N = 126; 71.2%) and PDs (N = 22; 78.6%) expressed a preference for in-person interviews over virtual interviews. If given a choice regarding the future direction for interviews, most applicants were unsure (N = 68; 38.4%) or would prefer to hold interviews virtually (N = 62; 35.0%); PDs felt that interviews should go back to being in-person (39.3%) or were unsure (28.6%). Most PDs (N = 21; 72.4%) reported an increased number of applications received by their respective programs this year compared to previous years. While applicants (N = 108; 61.0%) mostly felt that there should not be a cap on the number of applications, 19 (67.9%) PDs supported a limit on application numbers. Applicants spent an average (SD) of $2320.96 ($1172.86) on the application process this year, which is significantly less than 2018-2019 data.Conclusions: The ophthalmology residency application process was especially complex during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although many applicants and PDs were glad that interviews were held virtually this year, they were less certain regarding future years. The virtual format led to a significantly lower financial burden for applicants and may lead some to prefer this format in the future; if a hybrid model is offered for virtual/in-person interviews, these two interview modes should be compared equally.","Venincasa, Michael J; Steren, Benjamin; Young, Benjamin K; Parikh, Ankur; Ahmed, Bilal; Sridhar, Jayanth; Kombo, Ninani",Seminars in ophthalmology,103,29

Recent studies have shown that COVID-19 associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) can present with neurological signs and symptoms. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we have reviewed neurological involvement in these patients. METHODS A comprehensive electronic literature search was done on PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Cochrane database, and SCOPUS for the published English language articles from December 1, 2019, to February 28, 2021. A meta-analysis of the proportion was expressed as a pooled proportion with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Representative forest plots showing individual studies and the combined effect size were generated to provide an overview of the results. RESULTS This systematic review and meta-analysis analyzed 15 published MIS-C studies with a total of 785 patients. Neurological manifestations in patients with MIS-C was found in 27.1%. We found that 27% developed headaches, 17.1% developed meningism/meningitis and 7.6 % developed encephalopathy. Other uncommon neurological manifestations of MIS-C includes anosmia, seizures, cerebellar ataxia, global proximal muscle weakness and bulbar palsy. In MIS-C patients with neurological feature, neuroimaging showed signal changes in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Electroencephalography showed slow wave pattern and nerve conduction studies and electromyography showed mild myopathic and neuropathic changes. CONCLUSIONS Our study revealed that neurological manifestations are not uncommon in patients with MIS-C.

As a result, the fetal survival period was significantly prolonged (60.4 ± 3.8 vs. 18.2 ± 3.2 h, P < 0.01), and circuit resistance and minimal blood lactate levels were significantly lower in the parallel circuit group, compared with our previous single circuit group. Fetal physiological parameters remained stable until the conclusion of the experiments. In summary, parallelization of the AP system was associated with reduced circuit resistance and lactate levels and allowed preterm lamb fetuses to survive for a significantly longer period when compared with previous studies.","Miura, Yuichiro; Matsuda, Tadashi; Usuda, Haruo; Watanabe, Shimpei; Kitanishi, Ryuta; Saito, Masatoshi; Hanita, Takushi; Kobayashi, Yoshiyasu",Artificial organs,103,2

CASE DESCRIPTION A 41-year-old woman reported blurry vision OS 1 month after a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Left eye fundus examination revealed multiple peripapillary atrophic lesions, adjacent to a larger diffuse, ill-defined, yellow-whitish deep amoeboid-like patch, involving the peripapillary region and extending temporally to the fovea. Multimodal imaging including fluorescein angiography, indocyanine-green angiography, fundus autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography was consistent with serpiginous choroiditis. A complete systemic work-up was performed to exclude potential infectious or inflammatory etiologies. The active choroidal lesions responded to high dose corticosteroids, with functional improvement. Immunomodulatory therapy with methotrexate was initiated for long-term management. CONCLUSION Serpiginous choroiditis is a rare but important sight-threatening condition that has been previously associated to viral infections, which seem to have a role in the induction and/or perpetuation of choroidal inflammation.

Lowering the body mass index (BMI) threshold for bariatric surgery to those with moderate obesity might be one way to lower the burden of this disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding (LAGB) in moderately obese subjects with or without obesity-related co-morbidities. METHODS Thirty-four patients with BMI between 30 and 35 kg/m(2) (5 males/29 females, mean age 36 ± 10 years, mean preoperative weight 87.9 ± 7.1 kg, mean BMI 32.6 ± 1.6 kg/m(2) and mean percentage excess weight 48.7 ± 9 %) who underwent LAGB via pars flaccida between June 1, 2002 and August 31, 2010 were included. Good response was defined as BMI <30 kg/m(2) or percentage estimated weight loss (%EWL) >50. Poor response was defined as BMI >30 kg/m(2) or %EWL less than 50 after a minimum of 1 year. RESULTS Mean weight, BMI and %EWL were recorded at 1, 3, 5 and 7 years and were 77.4 ± 7.6, 69.9 ± 10.8, 70.9 ± 9.3 and 73.3 ± 12.0 kg; 28.8 ± 2.9, 26.4 ± 3.2, 26.5 ± 3.4 and 27.4 ± 5.0 kg/m(2); and 36 ± 23, 46.1 ± 33.8, 58.6 ± 31.5 and 45 ± 57, respectively (p < 0.01). Co-morbidities were diagnosed in 17/34 (50 %) patients at baseline and underwent remission or improvement in all cases after 1 year.

Canonical responses are composed of a short wave of plasmablasts (PBs) arising from EF sites, followed by GC producing somatically mutated memory B cells (MBC) and long-lived plasma cells. However, somatic hypermutation (SHM) and affinity maturation can take place at both sites, and a substantial fraction of MBC are produced prior to GC formation. Infection responses range from GC responses that persist for months to persistent EF responses with dominant suppression of GCs. Here, we review the current understanding of the functional output of EF and GC responses and the molecular switches promoting them. We discuss the signals that regulate the magnitude and duration of these responses, and outline gaps in knowledge and important areas of inquiry. Understanding such molecular switches will be critical for vaccine development, interpretation of vaccine efficacy and the treatment for autoimmune diseases.","Elsner, Rebecca A; Shlomchik, Mark J",Immunity,103,31

Major barriers to the implementation of screening are physician and system related-the requirement for a detailed smoking history, including pack-years, to determine eligibility. We conducted this pilot to determine the feasibility of lung cancer screening (LCS) promotion that would offer screening to eligible persons and patient completion of smoking history to estimate the size of the population of former smokers who may be eligible for LCS in a single health care system. PATIENTS AND METHODS Two hundred participants were randomly selected from former smokers who were seen at the University of Minnesota Health in the past 2 years and assigned to control (usual care) and electronic promotion, stratified by age. Electronic messages to promote LCS were sent to an intervention group, including a link to complete a detailed smoking history in the electronic health record. RESULTS Of 99 participants, 66 (67%) in the intervention group read the message, 24 (36%) of 66 responded, and 19 (79%) of 24 respondents completed the smoking history. Ten intervention participants and 13 usual care participants were eligible for screening on the basis of pack-year history. Four eligible participants underwent screening in the intervention group compared with one participant in the usual care group. CONCLUSION Electronic promotion may help identify patients who are eligible for LCS but will not reliably reach all patients because of low response rates. In this sample of former smokers, the majority are ineligible for LCS on the basis of pack-year history. Electronic methods can improve documentation of smoking history.","Begnaud, Abbie L; Joseph, Anne M; Lindgren, Bruce R",JCO clinical cancer informatics,103,5

Described using the Wilkins modification of the Gartland Classification system, current practice guidelines give moderate evidence for closed reduction and percutaneous pinning of type 2 and 3 injuries, but little evidence exists regarding the appropriate surgical setting for fixation. The goal of this study was to evaluate the perioperative complication profile of type 3 fractures with maintained metaphyseal contact and determine their suitability for outpatient surgery. METHODS Skeletally immature patients with type 2 and 3 SCH fractures treated at a single, Level-1 trauma institution from March 2019 to January 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 1126 subjects were identified. Open, concomitant injuries, incomplete physical examination, initial neurovascular compromise, flexion-type fractures, ecchymosis, skin compromise, and those managed nonoperatively were excluded. Type 3 fractures were categorized as either ""3M"" versus type ""3"" (""M"" denoting metaphyseal bony contact). Demographic data, neurovascular changes, and postoperative complications were collected. Categorical variables were evaluated using χ2 or Fisher exact tests, and continuous variables analyzed using analysis of variance, with significance defined as a P-value <0.05. RESULTS A total of 485 patients (189 type 2, 164 type 3M, 132 type 3) met inclusion criteria. Sex and length of stay did not differ among groups. The incidence of neurovascular change between initial presentation and surgical fixation was significantly greater for type 3 fractures compared with other groups (P=0.02). No child in the 3M group had preoperative neurovascular examination changes, compared with 3 patients with type 3 injuries. When directly compared with the 3M group, type 3 fractures had a higher incidence of neurovascular examination changes that trended towards significance (P=0.08). There was no difference in postoperative complication rate between groups (P=0.61). CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate that Gartland type 3 SCH fractures lacking metaphyseal bony contact, compared with types 3M and 2, are more likely to experience neurovascular examination changes between initial presentation and definitive surgical fixation. Type 3M fractures clinically behaved like type 2 injuries and, accordingly, could be considered for treatment on an outpatient basis.

This case series addresses cognition in post-COVID-19 patient by describing three patients in acute rehabilitation to inform a model of cognitive sequelae of COVID-19. Methods: Three English-speaking inpatients with severe symptoms and long-term intensive care unit (ICU) treatment are described. All patients had a premorbid history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and experienced delirium and hypoxemia when hospitalized. Patient 1 is a 62-year-old male with 15 years of education with additional history of obstructive sleep apnea and type 2 diabetes. Patient 2 is a 73-year-old female with 12 years of education with a premorbid medical history of alcohol use disorder and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Patient 3 is a 75-year-old male with 14 years of education. No patients had premorbid psychiatric histories. Results: The three patients demonstrated deficits on formal neuropsychological testing, particularly with encoding and verbal fluency. Memory measures improved with a more structured story memory task compared to a less-structured verbal list-learning task, suggesting executive dysfunction impacted learning. None of the patients demonstrated rapid forgetting of information. Two patients endorsed new depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: The results suggest evidence for neurocognitive deficits after severe COVID-19 infection, particularly in encoding and verbal fluency. These results were interpreted with caution given the limited number of patients and the telephone-based battery. The specific mechanism that caused these cognitive deficits in these individuals remains unclear. A proposed three-stage model of cognitive dysfunction is described to help guide future research.","Whiteside, Douglas M; Oleynick, Victoria; Holker, Erin; Waldron, Eric J; Porter, James; Kasprzak, Michael",The Clinical neuropsychologist,103,8

METHODS The sources of information used by the epidemiological surveillance of the municipality for COVID-19 were identified and the temporal distribution and interval for detection of confirmed cases of the disease were analyzed. RESULTS The city's epidemiological surveillance uses outpatient, hospital, public and private laboratory notifications as data sources. For reporting COVID-19 cases in official information systems, there is also an active search of laboratory results linked to suspected deaths investigated. From January to April 2020, 1,449 hospitalized cases of COVID-19 were reported, the first case being detected in late February 2020. Of the total 1,025 laboratory samples of cases hospitalized after the 8th epidemiological week, 87 (8.5%) of COVID-19 cases were confirmed. The median time between the onset of symptoms and the release of laboratory results was 12 days for the analyzed period. CONCLUSION Epidemiological surveillance uses several data sources to monitor and analyze the transmission of COVID-19. The timeliness of this system to detect cases of the disease is compromised by the delay in the release of laboratory results, which has been a considerable challenge for adequate surveillance.","Corrêa, Paulo Roberto Lopes; Ishitani, Lenice Harumi; Abreu, Daisy Maria Xavier de; Teixeira, Renato Azeredo; Marinho, Fatima; França, Elisabeth Barboza",Revista brasileira de epidemiologia = Brazilian journal of epidemiology,103,25

For this, 108 patients were enrolled in an open-label, randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups based on use of the Macintosh laryngoscope, McGrath video laryngoscope, or Pentax Airway Scope. Time to intubation, the intubation difficulty, and the quality of navigation were compared among groups. The median nasotracheal intubation time [interquartile range] in the Macintosh group (33.5 [28.3-39.8] s) was significantly shorter than those of the McGrath (39.0 [32.0-43.0] s) and Pentax groups (43.0 [35.0-52.0] s). The difficulty of nasotracheal intubation was similar among all groups. When navigating and aligning the tube from the oropharynx into the glottic inlet, the cuff inflation method was required in significantly fewer patients for the Macintosh group (11.1%) than for the McGrath (48.6%) and Pentax (51.4%) groups. Thus, compared to the McGrath video laryngoscope and Pentax Airway Scope, the Macintosh laryngoscope allowed shorter nasotracheal intubation times and better facilitated tracheal navigation, requiring less use of the cuff inflation method to navigate the tracheal tube into the glottic inlet.","Yoo, Ji Young; Chae, Yun Jeong; Lee, Young Bok; Kim, Sujin; Lee, Jaemoon; Kim, Dae Hee",Scientific reports,103,1

We evaluated the effects of manual hyperinflation and ventilator hyperinflation on mucus clearance, gas exchange, pulmonary mechanics, and hemodynamics. METHODS Six mechanically ventilated pigs with severe Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia randomly received either 12 manual hyperinflation breaths over a period of 2 min (through a gradual manual compression of a resuscitation bag within 4 s to achieve 40 cm H2O of airway pressure), or 12 ventilator hyperinflation over 2 min to achieve the same ventilatory end points as in manual hyperinflation. Mucus clearance rate was measured through fluoroscopic tracking of tracheal markers. Prior to each maneuver and 15 min thereafter, we assessed arterial and mixed gas exchange, pulmonary mechanics, and hemodynamics. RESULTS Both manual hyperinflation and ventilator hyperinflation significantly decreased inspiratory flow by approximately 16 L/min (P < .001) and increased peak expiratory flow by roughly 44 L/min (P < .001). The median (interquartile range) mucus clearance rate was 1.31 (0.84 -2.30) prior to the interventions, and 0.70 (0.00 -2.58) and 0.65 (0.45-1.47) during manual hyperinflation and ventilator hyperinflation, respectively (P = .09). Hyperinflations, whether delivered manually or through the ventilator, did not significantly modify pulmonary or hemodynamic parameters. CONCLUSIONS In an animal model of severe P. aeruginosa pneumonia, neither manual hyperinflation nor ventilator hyperinflation improved mucus clearance. If confirmed in comprehensive clinical experimentations, these findings should promote reappraisal of indications for both manual hyperinflation and ventilator hyperinflation as a therapeutic technique for mucus clearance and atelectasis reversal.","Li Bassi, Gianluigi; Martí, Joan Daniel; Comaru, Talitha; Aguilera-Xiol, Eli; Rigol, Montserrat; Ntoumenopoulos, George; Terraneo, Silvia; De Rosa, Francesca; Rinaudo, Mariano; Fernandez-Barat, Laia; Battaglini, Denise; Meli, Andrea; Ferrer, Miguel; Pelosi, Paolo; Chiumello, Davide; Torres, Antoni",Respiratory care,103,1

OBJECTIVE To investigate the moderation effect of education on this relationship and which brain structures support health numeracy. METHODS We examined 70 healthy older persons (66% females; mean ± SD: age, 75.73 ± 4.52 years; education, 12.21 ± 2.94 years). The participants underwent a T1-weighted 3-T MRI and a neuropsychological assessment including a health numeracy task. Statistical parametric mapping was applied to identify focal changes in cortical thickness throughout the entire brain and to correlate image parameters with behavioral measures. RESULTS Executive functions and mental calculation emerged as predictors of health numeracy (B = 0.22, p < 0.05, and B = 0.38, p < 0.01). An interaction was found between education and executive functions (B = -0.16, p = 0.01) and between education and mental calculation (B = -0.11, p < 0.05). Executive functions and mental calculation had an impact on health numeracy in participants with a low to intermediate edu-cation (≤12 years) but not in those with a higher education (>12 years). Health numeracy scores were associated with cortical thickness in the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and the right superior temporal gyrus (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Older people with a higher education perform better in health numeracy tasks than those with a lower education. They have access to previously acquired knowledge about ratio concepts and do not need to rely on executive functions and computational skills. This is highly relevant when decisions about health care have to be made.","Zamarian, Laura; Lenhart, Lukas; Nagele, Melanie; Steiger, Ruth; Gizewski, Elke Ruth; Benke, Thomas; Scherfler, Christoph; Delazer, Margarete",Gerontology,103,24

Previous studies have shown that older age, female gender, and some comorbid conditions are associated with chronic CHIKV arthritis. However, the factors associated with acute arthralgia and arthritis are not well known. Thus, we studied the clinical manifestations associated with acute peripheral joint involvement in a group of CHIKV patients from Puerto Rico. Patients with a history of fever for < 7 days evaluated at the emergency department of a university-based hospital were tested for several pathogens including CHIKV. All patients with laboratory-positive CHIKV infection were studied. Demographic features, clinical manifestations, and comorbidities were determined. Patients with and without peripheral joint involvement were compared using bivariable and multivariable analyses. In total, 172 patients with CHIKV fever were evaluated; 52.9% were women. The mean (standard deviation) age was 21.1 years (19.3). Peripheral arthralgia and/or arthritis were seen in 156 (90.7%) patients. In the multivariable analysis adjusted for age and gender, peripheral joint involvement was associated with myalgia (odds ratio [OR] = 4.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.48-14.72), back pain (OR = 16.77, 95% CI = 3.07-313.82), ocular pain (OR = 8.88, 95% CI = 1.65-165.19), headache (OR = 3.63, 95% CI = 1.06-12.53), anorexia (OR = 5.68, 95% CI = 1.87-18.97), and nausea (OR = 6.88, 95% CI = 2.05-31.49).

These fields can tap energy and angular momentum from spinning black holes through superradiant instabilities, during which a macroscopic bosonic condensate develops around the black hole. Striking features of this phenomenon include gaps in the spin-mass distribution of astrophysical black holes and a continuous gravitational-wave (GW) signal emitted by the condensate. So far these processes have been studied in great detail for scalar fields and, more recently, for vector fields. Here we take an important step forward in the black hole superradiance program by computing, analytically, the instability timescale, direct GW emission, and stochastic background, in the case of massive tensor (i.e., spin-2) fields. Our analysis is valid for any black hole spin and for small boson masses. The instability of massive spin-2 fields shares some properties with the scalar and vector cases, but its phenomenology is much richer, for example, there exist multiple modes with comparable instability timescales, and the dominant GW signal is hexadecapolar rather than quadrupolar. Electromagnetic and GW observations of spinning black holes in the mass range M∈(1,10^{10}) M_{⊙} can constrain the mass of a putative spin-2 field in the range 10^{-22}≲m_{b} c^{2}/eV≲10^{-10} . For 10^{-17}≲m_{b} c^{2}/eV≲10^{-15} , the space mission LISA could detect the continuous GW signal for sources at redshift z=20, or even larger.","Brito, Richard; Grillo, Sara; Pani, Paolo",Physical review letters,103,33

This study investigated the advantages of three-dimensional (3D) stereoscopic visualization for laparoscopic gastrectomy over a conventional two-dimensional (2D) planar screen. The primary outcome of this study was operative time. Ninety-four consecutive cases of gastric cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) (25 cases) or laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) (69 cases) were enrolled in this study before and after the introduction of the 3D system. Operative time was significantly shorter in the 3D groups for both LTG (351 vs. 406 min, P = 0.026) and LDG (269 vs. 344 min, P < 0.01). During intracorporeal procedures, dissection time was significantly shorter in the 3D groups for both LTG (183 vs. 232 min, P = 0.011) and LDG (161 vs. 213 min, P < 0.01), although the time needed for anastomosis was similar between the groups. However, operators preferred intracorporeal knot-tying as a ligature for anastomosis under 3D (LTG, P = 0.012; LDG, P < 0.01). These data suggest that 3D stereoscopic visualization shortens the operative time of laparoscopic gastrectomy by reducing the intracorporeal dissection time.","Itatani, Yoshiro; Obama, Kazutaka; Nishigori, Tatsuto; Ganeko, Riki; Tsunoda, Shigeru; Hosogi, Hisahiro; Hisamori, Shigeo; Hashimoto, Kyoichi; Sakai, Yoshiharu",Scientific reports,103,1

However, only 1 in 5 ACS patients are referred for cardiac rehabilitation nationally, and even fewer at our institution. We sought to improve the number of referrals to cardiac rehabilitation for post-ACS patients admitted to our inpatient cardiology service, and ultimately their participation in the program. We designed a quality improvement initiative that included education of patients and housestaff, automated referral order, and participation of cardiac rehabilitation staff members on multidisciplinary rounds. We compared the number of patients who received a referral to cardiac rehabilitation, had the first appointment scheduled prior to hospital discharge, and attended the program before and after our intervention. Six months after initiation of the project, the proportion of ACS patients referred to cardiac rehabilitation prior to hospital discharge increased from 10% to 43% (p <0.001). The mean number of patients with a cardiac rehabilitation appointment scheduled prior to discharge was 2 before and 5 after the intervention (p<0.001), and the mean number of patients who attended their scheduled appointment was 1 before and 3 after the intervention (p=0.001). Run charts demonstrated that the number of referrals and number of scheduled appointments remained above the median following the intervention. In conclusion, an initiative that included education, automated referrals, and direct one-on-one contact with cardiac rehabilitation staff prior to discharge increased the number of cardiac rehabilitation referrals, and appointments scheduled and attended in post-ACS patients.","Matthia, Eldon L; Mohadjer, Ashley; Randall, Morgan H; Canha, Catarina; Warren, Elizabeth; Ashraf, Hassan M; Plasschaert, Jeffrey M; Winchester, David E; Keeley, Ellen C",Critical pathways in cardiology,103,6

Despite this, these strategies are often not implemented. The aim of this study was to assess a closed-loop fluid administration system in a surgical cohort and compare the results with those for matched patients who received manual management. Our hypothesis was that the patients receiving closed-loop assistance would spend more time in a preload-independent state, defined as percentage of case time with stroke volume variation less than or equal to 12%. METHODS Patients eligible for the study were all those over 18 years of age scheduled for hepatobiliary, pancreatic or splenic surgery and expected to receive intravascular arterial blood pressure monitoring as part of their anesthetic care. The closed-loop resuscitation target was selected by the primary anesthesia team, and the system was responsible for implementation of goal-directed fluid therapy during surgery. Following completion of enrollment, each study patient was matched to a non-closed-loop assisted case performed during the same time period using a propensity match to reduce bias. RESULTS A total of 40 patients were enrolled, 5 were ultimately excluded and 25 matched pairs were selected from among the remaining 35 patients within the predefined caliper distance. There was no significant difference in fluid administration between groups. The closed-loop group spent a significantly higher portion of case time in a preload-independent state (95 ± 6% of case time versus 87 ± 14%, P =0.008). There was no difference in case mean or final stroke volume index (45 ± 10 versus 43 ± 9 and 45 ± 11 versus 42 ± 11, respectively) or mean arterial pressure (79 ± 8 versus 83 ± 9). Case end heart rate was significantly lower in the closed-loop assisted group (77 ± 10 versus 88 ± 13, P =0.003). CONCLUSION In this case-control study with propensity matching, clinician use of closed-loop assistance resulted in a greater portion of case time spent in a preload-independent state throughout surgery compared with manual delivery of goal-directed fluid therapy.

Although epigenetic regulation including miR-21-3p associated with autophagy process has been reported in many cancer types, nevertheless, the mechanism of miR-21-3p in bovine ovary is poorly understood. In the present study, bovine ovarian granulosa cells (BGCs) were used as a model to elucidate the autophagy and role of miR-21-3p in a cattle ovary. The results from gene expression and tagged autophagosomes showed the autophagy in BGCs and miR-21-3p was identified as an important miRNA regulating autophagy of BGCs. The current results indicated that FGF2 was a validated target of miR-21-3p in autophagy regulation of BGCs according to the results from FGF2 luciferase reporter assays and FGF2 overexpression (oe-FGF2) or small interference (si-FGF2). Transfection of miR-21-3p mimic and si-FGF2 plasmids resulted in decreasing phosphorylated AKT and mTOR, while transfection of miR-21-3p inhibitor and oe-FGF2 increased the phosphorylated level of AKT and mTOR in BGCs. These data indicate that regulation of miR-21-3p on BGCs autophagy through AKT/mTOR pathway. In summary, this study suggests that miR-21-3p targets FGF2 to inhibit BGCs autophagy by repressing AKT/mTOR signaling.","Ma, Lizhu; Tang, Xiaorong; Guo, Shun; Liang, Mingyue; Zhang, Bin; Jiang, Zhongliang",Theriogenology,103,19

Areas covered: This review provides an overview of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) and their mechanisms of effect in ARDS and sepsis. The preclinical and clinical evidence to support MSC therapy in ARDS and sepsis is discussed. The potential for MSC therapy in COVID-19 ARDS is discussed with insights from respiratory viral models and early clinical reports of MSC therapy in COVID-19. Strategies to optimise the therapeutic potential of MSCs in ARDS and sepsis are considered including preconditioning, altered gene expression, and alternative cell free MSC derived products, such as extracellular vesicles and conditioned medium. Expert opinion: MSC products present considerable therapeutic promise for ARDS and sepsis. Preclinical investigations report significant benefit and early phase clinical studies have not highlighted safety concerns. Optimisation of MSC function in preclinical models of ARDS and sepsis has enhanced their beneficial effects. MSC derived products, as cell free alternatives, may provide further advantages in this field.

However, medical information regarding the urogenital involvement in recovered COVID-19 patients is limited or unknown. OBJECTIVES To comprehensively evaluate urogenital involvement in recovered COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Men aged between 20 years and 50 years who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovered when the study was conducted were enrolled in our study. Demographic, clinical characteristics and history of hospitalization were collected and analyzed. Urine, expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) and semen samples were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Semen quality and hormonal profiles were analyzed. RESULTS Among 74 male recovered COVID-19 patients, 11 (14.9%) were asymptomatic, classified into mild type, and 31 (41.9%) were classified into moderate type. The remaining patients (32/74, 43.2%) had severe pneumonia. No critically ill recovered COVID-19 patient was recruited in our cohort. The median interval between last positive pharyngeal swab RT-PCR test and semen samples collection was 80 days (IQR, 64-93). The median age was 31 years (IQR, 27-36; range, 21-49) and the median body mass index (BMI) was 24.40 (IQR, 22.55-27.30). Forty-five (61.6%) men were married, and 28 (38.4%) were unmarried. Fifty-three (72.6%) patients denied cigarette smoking, 18 (24.7%) were active smokers, and 2 of them were past smokers. The majority of our participants (53/74, 72.6%) did not consume alcohol. Fever occurred in most of the patients (75.3%) and 63 of them had abnormal chest CT images. Only one patient complained of scrotal discomfort during the course of COVID-19, which was ruled out orchitis by MRI (data not shown). A total of 205 samples were collected for SARS-CoV-2 detection (74 urine samples, 70 semen samples and 61 EPS samples). However, viral nucleic acid was not detected in body fluids from the urogenital system. In terms of hormonal profiles, levels of FSH, LH, testosterone and estradiol were 5.20 [4.23] mIU/mL, 3.95 [1.63] mIU/mL, 3.65 [1.19] ng/mL, 39.48 [12.51] pg/mL, respectively. And these values were within the normal limits. The overall semen quality of recovered COVID-19 patients was above the lower reference limit released by the WHO. While compared with healthy-control, sperm concentration, total sperm count and total motility were significantly declined. In addition, different clinical types of COVID-19 have no significant difference in semen parameters, but total sperm count showed a descending trend. Interestingly, subjects with a longer recovery time showed worse data for sperm quality. Small sample size and lacking semen parameters before the infection are the major limitations of our study. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest cohort study with longest follow-up for urogenital evaluation comprehensively so far. Direct urogenital involvement was not found in the recovered COVID-19 male patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was undetectable in the urogenital secretions, and semen quality declined slightly while hormonal profiles remained normal. Moreover, patients with a long time (≥ 90 days) since recovery had lower total sperm count. Great attention and further study should be conducted and follow up on the reproductive function in the following months.","Ruan, Yajun; Hu, Bintao; Liu, Zhuo; Liu, Kang; Jiang, Hongyang; Li, Hao; Li, Rui; Luan, Yang; Liu, Xiaming; Yu, Gan; Xu, Shengfei; Yuan, Xiaoyi; Wang, Shaogang; Yang, Weimin; Ye, Zhangqun; Liu, Jihong; Wang, Tao",Andrology,103,19

If it occurs reproducibly, PRF applied to peripheral nerves should provoke neurolysis because the impairment of mitochondria is known as the primary cause of apoptosis. Methods Human monocytic cells THP-1 loaded with 100 nM tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), a fluorescent dye that proves the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), were exposed to the electric field of continuous radiofrequency (CRF) or PRF current. The TMRM-related fluorescence from THP-1 cells was measured by flow cytometry. Results The exposure of THP-1 cells to a PRF electric field generated by NeuroTherm NT500 for 15 min with maximum power did not decrease MMP in these cells, nor did it cause the induction of apoptosis. By contrast, the application of CRF current at 70 °C for 3 min significantly decreased MMP and induced apoptosis within 10 min after CRF application. Conclusion We conclude from these findings that PRF application does not provoke mitochondrial injury in various types of mammalian cells because the size and the subcellular structure of the plasma membrane or mitochondria are similar among those. However, the present results cannot address the effect of PRF current on organic structure around the nervous system. Further study is required to solve the question of whether PRF current causes neurolysis or not.","Nishioka, Akira; Kimura, Maiko; Sakamoto, Eriko; Nagasaka, Hiroshi; Azma, Toshiharu",Journal of pain research,103,16

Despite the conserved structures of the glycans involved in docking, they are still considered ""undruggable"", meaning these glycans are beyond the scope of conventional pharmacological strategies. Recent advances in the development of synthetic carbohydrate receptors (SCRs), small molecules that bind carbohydrates, could bring carbohydrate-receptor interactions within the purview of druggable targets. Here we discuss the role of carbohydrate-receptor interactions in viral infection, the evolution of SCRs, and recent results demonstrating their ability to prevent viral infections in vitro. Common SCR design strategies based on boronic ester formation, metal chelation, and noncovalent interactions are discussed. The benefits of incorporating the idiosyncrasies of natural glycan-binding proteins-including flexibility, cooperativity, and multivalency-into SCR design to achieve nonglucosidic specificity are shown. These studies into SCR design and binding could lead to new strategies for mitigating the grave threat to human health posed by enveloped viruses, which are heavily glycosylated viroids that are the cause of some of the most pressing and untreatable diseases, including HIV, Dengue, Zika, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2.","Bravo, M Fernando; Lema, Manuel A; Marianski, Mateusz; Braunschweig, Adam B",Biochemistry,103,5

Unrelated benefits to resident education have accrued from those efforts, but, despite rigorous study of the issue, there is little evidence of a positive impact on patient safety resulting from trainee duty hours adjustments. Moreover, the discussion has become worrisomely myopic in its singular preoccupation with the impact of postgraduate medical education duty hours on safe patient care. The author argues that patient safety efforts should focus instead on the three essential elements of capacity, of which a discussion of duty hours and fatigue are an important part, commitment, and competence. Commitment requires altruism and professionalism, which are discouraged by a shift-work orientation. Competence is essential for safe patient care; as duty hours are constricted in the name of reducing fatigue-related medical error, it must be remembered that a certain amount of time is required to both acquire a knowledge base and attain proficiency in needed technical skills. Until a competency-based educational system can be implemented, the profession and patients would be well served by a heightened awareness of the increased number of years required in a constrained work hours environment to achieve proficiency in the independent practice of medicine, especially when procedural competence is required. Such a realization will inevitably result in voluntary lengthening of some residency training programs, particularly in surgical disciplines and those medical specialties with a prominent procedural component.","Pellegrini, Vincent D",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,103,1

METHODS This study evaluated 14 meshes including bare polypropylene, macroporous polytetrafluoroethylene, absorbable barrier, partially absorbable mesh, and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene materials. Each mesh provided 15 specimens, which were prepared in 7.5 × 7.5-cm squares. Of these, 5 ""undamaged"" specimens were subjected to ball-burst testing to determine their biomechanical properties before application of helical titanium tacks (ProTack). To 10 ""damaged"" specimens 7 tacks were applied 1 cm apart in a 3.5-cm-diameter circle using a tacking force of 25 to 28 N. The tacks were removed from five of the specimens before ball-burst testing and left intact in the remaining five specimens. RESULTS The application of tacks had no effect on the tensile strength of Dualmesh, ProLite Ultra, Infinit, Ultrapro, C-QUR Lite (<6 in.), Prolene Soft, or Physiomesh, but the tensile strengths were reduced for Bard Mesh, C-QUR, ProLite, and C-QUR Lite (>6 in.). Most of the meshes did not exhibit significantly different tensile strengths between removal of tacks and tacks left intact. Exceptions included C-QUR, Prolene, Ultrapro, and Bard Soft Mesh, which were weaker with removal of tacks than with tacks left intact during the test. Damage due to the application of helical titanium tacks also caused increased strain at a stress of 16 N/cm for all the meshes except C-QUR Lite (>6 in.) and Physiomesh. CONCLUSIONS Many of the meshes evaluated in this study exhibited damage in the form of reduced tensile strength and increased extensibility after the application of tacks compared with the corresponding ""undamaged"" meshes. Meshes with smaller interstices and larger filaments were influenced negatively by the application of helical titanium tacks, whereas mesh designs with larger interstices and smaller filaments tended to maintain their baseline mechanical properties.","Lerdsirisopon, Sopon; Frisella, Margaret M; Matthews, Brent D; Deeken, Corey R",Surgical endoscopy,103,28

We found that work rates were unachievable (ie, exceeded 1 hour of scheduled work per hour of available labor) for 75% of scheduled due times, despite presumed achievable average work load. OBJECTIVE To determine the optimal strategy for creating work assignments based on work rate. METHODS A focus group used root-cause analysis to identify ways to balance assignments based on work rate. We surveyed employees to assess their willingness to start earlier. We determined the ratio of scheduled to unscheduled work during a 12-month period. The scheduled work comprised administering small-volume nebulizer, metered-dose inhaler, noninvasive ventilation, and mechanical ventilation. The unscheduled work consisted of all other modalities. We also developed a spreadsheet model to assess the effect of shifting the start time on work-rate distribution in a representative 24-hour period. RESULTS The focus group determined that starting treatments 1 hour earlier would help. Fifteen of the 24 clinicians surveyed responded, and 13 of the respondents were willing to start earlier. The scheduled work load averaged approximately 55% of the total work load, but there was high variability per assignment area (range 0-99%). The spreadsheet model showed that shifting treatment start times improved the distribution of work rate throughout the day, but did not guarantee that labor demand never outstrips supply. CONCLUSIONS Our studies to date suggest that: basing assignments on average work load leads to periods of unachievable work rate, resulting in missed treatments and staff dissatisfaction. We have only limited ability to reduce peaks in work rate, but staggering treatment times is effective. Fair assignment of work should differentiate scheduled from unscheduled work.","Chatburn, Robert L; Gole, Susan; Schenk, Philip; Hoisington, Edward R; Stoller, James K",Respiratory care,103,31

Those who wished to proceed with surgery had a mean age of 68.5 years while those who did not had a mean age of 72.4 years (P = 0.03). Within the matched subgroups, patients under the age of 70 years were more willing to proceed with primary hip arthroplasty surgery (87.9%) compared with primary knee arthroplasty surgery (57.1%; P = 0.007); 75% of the patients who did not wish to proceed with surgery expressed concerns about perioperative COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION There is a significant proportion of arthroplasty patients on waiting lists who would be willing to accept the increased risks associated with COVID-19 to undergo surgery on an urgent basis. The subgroup of younger patients awaiting hip arthroplasty is more willing than those awaiting knee arthroplasty to proceed with surgery.","Madanipour, S; Al-Obaedi, O; Ayub, A; Iranpour, F; Subramanian, P",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,103,1

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for maintaining peripheral tolerance, preventing autoimmune diseases, and limiting chronic inflammatory diseases. However, they also limit beneficial immune responses by suppressing anti-infectious and anti-tumor immunity. Mounting evidence suggests that Tregs are involved, at least in part, in the low effectiveness of immunization against various diseases where it has been difficult to obtain protective vaccines. Interestingly, increased activity of Tregs is associated with aging, suggesting a key role for these cells in the lower vaccine effectiveness observed in older people. In this review, we analyze the impact of Tregs on vaccination, with a focus on older adults. Finally, we address an overview of current strategies for Tregs modulation with potential application to improve the effectiveness of future vaccines targeting older populations.","Batista-Duharte, Alexander; Pera, Alejandra; Aliño, Salvador F; Solana, Rafael",International immunopharmacology,103,31

INTRODUCTION Nausea is one of the most bothersome symptoms in patients with migraine. The most bothersome symptom is part of the outcomes explored in clinical trials. METHODS Published clinical trials for this project were identified via searches of 4 bibliographic databases: PubMed (includes MEDLINE), Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Individual search strategies included terms related to calcitonin gene-related peptide, nausea, and vomiting. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the overall efficacy of gepants for nausea treatment. Heterogeneity, publication bias, small-study bias, and potential confounders were explored using Galbraith plot, sensitivity analysis, meta-regression, and Egger's regression tests. Cumulative meta-analysis was done to detect temporal trend from accumulating trials. RESULTS The meta-analysis involved 23,008 participants in 65 clinical trials from 14 published articles; 10,770 subjects participated in gepant treatment arms while 12,238 subjects participated in placebo or non-gepant arms (85% females, mean age 41 years in both arms). Nearly all studies used a 2-hour incidence of nausea as an outcome measure. An overall combined effect size with an odds ratio of 1.29 (95% CI 1.18, 1.40, P = .001; I2 = 42.8%) showed the efficacy of gepants for the treatment of nausea in episodic migraine. Galbraith plot demonstrated that 98.4% of studies were within 2 standard deviations from the regression line, indicating lack of significant heterogeneity and outliers. Meta-analysis results were robust to sensitivity analysis, small-study bias, and publication bias (Kendall's Tau -0.09, P = .29; Egger's regression P = .67). Meta-regression showed that both age and sex ratio were not confounding the meta-analysis (omnibus P = .69). Cumulative meta-analysis indicated that the effect size remained stable for studies conducted after 2011, with accumulating evidence continuing to favor efficacy of gepants for the treatment of nausea in episodic migraine. CONCLUSION There is sufficient evidence to support the efficacy of gepants for the treatment of nausea in episodic migraine. Future research may focus on examining this efficacy in under-represented patient populations (males, older age groups) and in chronic migraine.","Chan, Tommy Lik Hang; Cowan, Robert P; Woldeamanuel, Yohannes W",Headache,103,16

In this study, we performed 3-channel or 4-channel SILC without the use of inverse triangulation. We evaluated the adequacy and feasibility of SILC using our surgical method. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our series of 309 SILCs performed between March 2014 and February 2015. RESULTS Among 309 SILCs, male were 148 and female were 161 patients, mean age was 48.7 ± 15.3 years old and mean body mass index was 24.8 ± 3.8 kg/m(2). Forty patients had previously undergone abdominal surgery including 6 cases of upper abdominal surgery. SILC after percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder (GB) drainage was completed in 8.7% of cases. There were 10 cases of emergency SILC. SILC was performed for noncomplicated GB including symptomatic GB stone and polyp in 66.7% of cases, acute cholecystitis in 33.3%. Overall, 96.8% of procedures were successfully completed without additional port. The reason for addition of an extra port or open conversion included technical difficulties due to severe adhesion and bleeding. The mean operating time was 60.7 ± 22.3 minutes. The overall complication rate was 4.8%: 9 patients of wound seroma, 1 case of bile leakage from GB bed, 4 cases of intra-abdominal abscess or fluid collection, and 1 case of incisional hernia were developed. There was no case of common bile duct injury. CONCLUSION Our surgical method of SILC without the use of inverse triangulation is safe, feasible and effective technique.","Ryu, Yun Beom; Lee, Jung Woo; Park, Yo Han; Lim, Man Sup; Cho, Ji Woong; Jeon, Jang Yong",Annals of surgical treatment and research,103,2

Here, we use deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) and deactivated Cas12a (dCas12a) to construct dynamic RNA ring oscillators that cycle continuously between states over time in bacterial cells. While our dCas9 circuits using 103-nt guide RNAs showed irregular fluctuations with a wide distribution of peak-to-peak period lengths averaging approximately nine generations, a dCas12a oscillator design with 40-nt CRISPR RNAs performed much better, having a strongly repressed off-state, distinct autocorrelation function peaks, and an average peak-to-peak period length of ∼7.5 generations. Along with free-running oscillator circuits, we measure repression response times in open-loop systems with inducible RNA steps to compare with oscillator period times. We track thousands of cells for 24+ h at the single-cell level using a microfluidic device. In creating a circuit with nearly translationally independent behavior, as the RNAs control each others' transcription, we present the possibility for a synthetic oscillator generalizable across many organisms and readily linkable for transcriptional control.","Kuo, James; Yuan, Ruoshi; Sánchez, Carlos; Paulsson, Johan; Silver, Pamela A",Nucleic acids research,103,20

BACKGROUND The trend towards higher levels of automation in industry is increasing. Consequently, manufacturing operators often monitor automated process for long periods of their work shift. Prolonged monitoring work requires sustained attention, which is a cognitive process that humans are typically poor at and find stressful. As sustained attention becomes an increasing requirement of manufacturing operators' job content, the resulting stress experienced could contribute to the onset of many health problems, including work related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs). METHODS The SART attention test was completed by a group of participants before and after a breathing intervention exercise. The effects of the abdominal breathing intervention on breathing rate, upper trapezius muscle activity and end-tidal CO₂ were evaluated. RESULTS The breathing intervention reduced the moderation effect of end-tidal CO₂ on upper trapezius muscle activity. CONCLUSIONS Abdominal breathing could be a useful technique in reducing the effects of sustained attention work on muscular activity. APPLICATION This research can be applied to highly-automated manufacturing industries, where prolonged monitoring of work is widespread and could, in its role as a stressor, be a potential contributor to WRMSDs.","Wixted, Fiona; O'Riordan, Cliona; O'Sullivan, Leonard",International journal of environmental research and public health,103,1

In principle, this approach could account even for nonadditive genetic interactions, which underlie the synergistic combinations of mutations often linked to complex diseases. Here, we analyze a large-scale, human gene functional interaction network (dubbed HumanNet). We show that candidate disease genes can be effectively identified by GBA in cross-validated tests using label propagation algorithms related to Google's PageRank. However, GBA has been shown to work poorly in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), where many genes are somewhat implicated, but few are known with very high certainty. Here, we resolve this by explicitly modeling the uncertainty of the associations and incorporating the uncertainty for the seed set into the GBA framework. We observe a significant boost in the power to detect validated candidate genes for Crohn's disease and type 2 diabetes by comparing our predictions to results from follow-up meta-analyses, with incorporation of the network serving to highlight the JAK-STAT pathway and associated adaptors GRB2/SHC1 in Crohn's disease and BACH2 in type 2 diabetes. Consideration of the network during GWAS thus conveys some of the benefits of enrolling more participants in the GWAS study. More generally, we demonstrate that a functional network of human genes provides a valuable statistical framework for prioritizing candidate disease genes, both for candidate gene-based and GWAS-based studies.","Lee, Insuk; Blom, U Martin; Wang, Peggy I; Shim, Jung Eun; Marcotte, Edward M",Genome research,103,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS Sixty-one patients with COVID-19 were divided into two groups: an improvement/stabilization group (n = 53) and a progression group (n = 8). Clinical data were collected to analyze and compare the differences between the two groups. RESULTS Of the sixty-one patients, thirty-one were male (50.8%), and thirty were female (49.2%), with a median age of 53 years. On admission, significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to the levels of Creatine Kinase (CK), lymphocytes, D-dimer and creatinine, and prothrombin time (PT). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocytes, Mean platelet volume to lymphocyte ratio (MPVLR), CK, White Blood count to mean platelet volume ratio (WMR), Lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), and serum creatinine were important factors for disease progression. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that PLR was an independent factor for disease progression in COVID-19 patients. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve revealed that the best predictor of disease progression was CK. Dynamic changes in the laboratory indicators of patients were tracked, and significant differences were found in the variation trends of white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and WMR, which gradually increased in the progression group, but gradually decreased in the improvement/stabilization group. CONCLUSIONS Risk factors for disease progression included PLR, lymphocytes, MPVLR, CK, WMR, LMR, and creatinine, among which, PLR is an independent risk factor for disease progression in COVID-19 patients.","Xing, Y; Wang, H; Yao, X-H; Li, Y; Huang, J-T; Tang, J; Zhu, S; Liu, Y-Q; Xiao, J",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,103,1

For many, wet-lab demonstrations using animal tissues have been reduced or replaced with student-led investigations where students are both subjects and researchers. Despite these changes, expectations remain that physiology courses should include a practical component to encourage deeper and higher-order learning. Wet-lab tissue experiments and student-based group research formats can be expensive to run, associated with various ethical constraints, and, as discovered in these times of COVID-19, difficult to operate while adhering to physical distancing. We address the proposition that online and/or remote delivery of laboratory classes using digital technologies may provide a solution to both financial and ethical constraints of on-campus laboratory classes. Our discussions, as an international group of 10 physiologists from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, revealed that although some of the financial and ethical constraints of using animal tissues and student-led investigations were addressed by the introduction of online alternatives, the construction and maintenance of online delivery modes could also be expensive and ethical issues, not previously considered, included digital equity and student data security. There was also a collective perception that if face-to-face laboratory classes were changed to an entirely virtual mode there was a risk that some intended learning outcomes would not be met. It was concluded that the ""ideal"" approach is likely a hybrid model whereby student attendance in face-to-face, on-campus classes is supported with interactive digital content either developed in house or obtained through third-party providers.","Gaganis, Voula; Beckett, Elizabeth; Choate, Julia; Aguilar-Roca, Nancy; Etherington, Sarah; Haigh, Charlotte; Scott, Derek; Sweeney, Terrence; Zubek, John; French, Michelle",Advances in physiology education,103,1

METHODS Fifty-six consecutive patients with SCOS were included. Patients were classified into two groups on the basis of the diameter of seminiferous tubules measured against 5/0 surgical suture (≥100 µm or <100 µm). RESULTS The sperm retrieval rate (SRR) in men with a tubule diameter ≥100 µm was significantly lower than that in those with <100 µm (3.1% vs. 25.0%). The SRR from the contralateral testis in men with a tubule diameter ≥100 µm was lower than that in those with <100 µm (0% vs. 14.3%). Men with a tubule diameter ≥100 µm had a significantly larger testis and lower follicle-stimulating hormone levels than did men with <100 µm (8.1 ± 2.4 vs. 5.3±1.8 mL, 19.9 ± 9.7 vs. 25.9 ± 7.1 mIU/mL, respectively).

METHODS Eighty-four patients with grade III and IV hemorrhoids were randomized into two groups of 42 patients each; group 1 patients underwent LH whereas group 2 patients underwent OH. Data regarding patient demographics, operative details, postoperative pain score, amount of parenteral analgesics required, length of hospital stay, and time until return to work or normal physical activity were all prospectively collected. Postoperative complications and recurrence of prolapse were also recorded. All patients had regular follow-ups every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks postoperatively, and at 2-month intervals thereafter, for a total period of 12 months. RESULTS Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and length of hospital stay were similar in both groups (P > 0.05). The mean operative time, postoperative pain score (up to 48 h), amount of parenteral analgesics required, time off work, and time needed for complete wound healing were significantly less in patients who underwent LH (P < 0.001). Both groups had similar postoperative complications except for delayed wound healing that was observed at 4 weeks postoperatively, in seven patients (16.67%) in the LH group compared to 17 patients (40.48%) in the OH group (chi(2) = 5.83, P = 0.016). Although hemorrhoid recurrence, at 1 year, was also lower among the LH group compared to the OH group (2.38 vs. 9.14%, respectively), the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.167). CONCLUSIONS LH is a better alternative than conventional OH in treating prolapsed hemorrhoids (grades III and IV) since it reduces operating time, postoperative pain, and time off work, and allows surgical wounds to heal faster, with minimal comparable side effects and a low recurrence rate.","Sakr, M F",Techniques in coloproctology,103,1

The effects of workplace violence can be psychologically and physically devastating. Supportive resources are not always available or fully utilized when available. Aims: The purpose of this study is to explore the true impact of workplace violence toward psychiatric mental health nurses, as well as their personal perspectives on the types of supportive resources necessary for future implementation. Additionally, this study strives to identify the facilitators and barriers to acquiring supportive resources. Methods: A qualitative descriptive study design was utilized. The theory of cognitive adaptation provided an underlying conceptual framework. Data were collected using REDCap software to identify the nature and extent of workplace violence in the study setting (Survey 1) and solicit detailed responses to focus group questions designed to address the study aims (Survey 2). RESULTS: Six pertinent themes were discovered: frequent exposure to workplace violence, attempt to understand workplace violence, the need for supportive means, barriers to accessing supportive means, increase administrative support, and workplace violence has a detrimental impact on various aspects of life. CONCLUSIONS: Although psychiatric mental health nurses express a desire for more psychological support postassault, the underlying meaning and cognitive adaptation following the workplace violence experience is not well understood, and there are barriers to the acquisition of services. The findings from this study are being used to inform a multifaceted program to effectively support psychiatric mental health nurses experiencing workplace violence.","Dean, Lyndsay; Butler, Amanda; Cuddigan, Janet",Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association,103,4

The purpose of this study was to assess the short-term safety of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine in patients with high-risk submucosal invasive rectal cancer after local resection. METHODS This single-arm, multicenter, phase II trial included patients undergoing local resection for high-risk submucosal invasive rectal cancer within 12 weeks prior to enrollment. High-risk submucosal invasive rectal cancer was defined as the presence of at least one of the following factors: poor differentiation of adenocarcinoma, submucosal invasion depth > 1 mm, presence of lymphovascular invasion and grade-2 or -3 tumour budding. Protocol treatment comprised 45.0 Gy radiotherapy with conventional fractionation and 1650 mg/m2 capecitabine given twice daily until radiotherapy completion. The primary endpoint was treatment completion rate with an expected rate of 95% and a threshold of 80%. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients from six institutions were enrolled between May 2015 and February 2018. One patient was ineligible. Twenty-three patients completed treatment, with a completion rate of 82% (80% confidence interval, 69-91%); the remaining five patients completed treatment with protocol deviation. The median relative dose intensity of capecitabine was 100% (range, 58-100%). Common adverse events included radiation dermatitis (54%), anal pain (39%) and anal mucositis (29%).

In this study , repeated cross-sectional data were collected from 376 randomly selected globally located respondents over two periods. Participants perceived COVID-19 as severe as Tumor and AIDS (F (2,722) = 2.347; p = .096), and as more severe than other 14 illnesses; e.g. Diabetes and High blood pressure.

In addition, the magnitude of severity perception was found to be dependent on the different stages of the outbreak in the respondents' corresponding countries. In a gap of a month time, depression surpassed COVID-19 to be perceived as more severe. Majority of respondents attributed COVID-19 as a physical (vs mental) illness, thus considered it as more severe (vs less severe).

Current biopsy regimens recommend uniformly spaced random biopsies. We assessed the distribution of dysplasia in BE to develop evidence-based biopsy regimens. METHODS We performed analysis of the distribution of dysplasia within BE using pretreatment biopsy data from two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of radiofrequency ablation for dysplastic BE: the SURF (Surveillance vs. Radiofrequency Ablation) trial and the AIM Dysplasia (Ablation of Intestinal Metaplasia (AIM) Containing Dysplasia) trial. We used generalized linear models with generalized estimating equations (GEE) to estimate prevalence differences for dysplasia depending on the standardized location of biopsies. We performed Monte Carlo simulation of biopsy regimens to estimate their yield for any dysplasia within segments. RESULTS Dysplasia preferentially resides in the proximal-most half of the BE segment that is almost twice as likely to demonstrate dysplasia as the distal-most quartile. In pooled analysis, compared with the distal-most quarter, the prevalence difference in the proximal-most quarter was 22.6%, in the second proximal-most quarter 23.1%, and in the second distal-most quarter 15.3%. The best performing biopsy regimen in simulation studies acquired 8 biopsies in the most proximal cm of BE, 8 biopsies in the second cm, and 2 biopsies in each cm thereafter (q1cm: 8, 8, 2, 2…). A slightly simpler q2cm (every 2 cm) regimen (q2cm: 12, 12, 4…) was nearly as effective. CONCLUSIONS The post hoc analysis of two RCTs reveals a substantially increased prevalence of dysplasia proximally in BE segments. Our simulations suggest an altered biopsy regimen could increase sensitivity of biopsies in short-segment BE by >30%.","Cotton, Cary C; Duits, Lucas C; Wolf, W Asher; Peery, Anne F; Dellon, Evan S; Bergman, Jacques J; Shaheen, Nicholas J",The American journal of gastroenterology,103,27

To this end, three times per week, mice were injected intraperitoneally with TAA (200 mg/kg) for 8 weeks to induce liver fibrosis. After the fourth week of treatment, histological changes, the serum biochemical index, inflammation, and hepatocyte apoptosis factors (e.g., caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma 2 [Bcl-2], Bcl-2-associated X [Bax]) were detected to clarify its underlying mechanism. The results clearly indicated that ABA improves TAA-induced hepatic injury and collagen accumulation in mice. Otherwise, ABA significantly reduced liver fibrosis by regulating caspase-3 and Bcl-2, α-smooth muscle actin, and collagen I. ABA inhibited the nuclear factor kappa B pathway, significantly alleviating oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, ABA may be a potential therapeutic agent for preventing liver damage.","Chen, Xueyan; Ding, Chuanbo; Liu, Wencong; Liu, Xinglong; Zhao, Yingchun; Zheng, Yinan; Dong, Ling; Khatoon, Sadia; Hao, Mingqian; Peng, Xiaojuan; Zhang, Yue; Chen, Huiying",European journal of pharmacology,103,1

To date, 3 bocaviruses, canine bocaviruses 1 to 3 (CBoV-1-3), have been shown to affect dogs with different disease manifestations reported for infected animals. We used next-generation sequencing to identify a novel strain of canine CBoV-2 (CBoV TH-2016) in a litter of puppies that died in Thailand from acute dyspnea and hemoptysis, for which no causal pathogen could be identified in routine assays. Analysis of the complete coding sequences of CBoV TH-2016 showed that this virus was most closely related to a strain previously identified in South Korea (isolate 14D193), with evidence of genetic recombination in the VP2 gene with related strains from South Korea and Hong Kong. Use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed the presence of CBoV TH-2016 in several tissues, suggesting hematogenous virus spread, while only intestinal tissue was found to be positive by in situ hybridization and electron microscopy. Histologic small intestinal lesions associated with CBoV TH-2016 infection were eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies within villous enterocytes without villous atrophy or fusion, similar to those previously considered pathognomonic for CBoV-1 infection. Therefore, this study provides novel insights in the pathogenicity of canine bocavirus infections and suggests that a novel recombinant CBoV-2 may result in atypical findings of CBoV infection. Although the specific cause of death of these puppies remained undetermined, a contributory role of enteric CBoV TH-2016 infection is possible.","Piewbang, Chutchai; Jo, Wendy K; Puff, Christina; Ludlow, Martin; van der Vries, Erhard; Banlunara, Wijit; Rungsipipat, Anudep; Kruppa, Jochen; Jung, Klaus; Techangamsuwan, Somporn; Baumgärtner, Wolfgang; Osterhaus, Albert D M E",Veterinary pathology,103,17

METHODS 60 consecutive patients underwent gastric bypass surgery (34 female, 26 male; mean age 45.1 +/- 10.2 years). Mean preoperative BMI was 53.7 +/- 8.7 kg/m2. Selection criteria were age > 40, male sex,BMI > 50, metabolic syndrome, and/or reduced compliance. RESULTS 42 patients (70%) were >40 years old, 26 patients(43%) were male, 42 patients (70%) had a BMI > 50, and 28 patients had a metabolic syndrome (47%). 10 out of these 60 patients were reoperated after failed gastric banding. Overall weight loss was 43.7 +/- 18.7 kg, BMI loss was 15.0 +/- 6.4 kg/m2,and excess body weight loss (EBWL) was 54.3 +/- 19.7%. There were 34 patients with an EBWL of > or = 50%. Age, sex, and presence or absence of metabolic syndrome were irrelevant for postoperative weight loss. Although the EBWL was slightly higher in patients with a BMI < 50, patients with a BMI > 50 lost significantly more weight. DISCUSSION The indication for a gastric bypass may be substantiated by the higher weight reduction in patients with a BMI > 50.

Individually adjusting the NAN balance to prevent somatic responses to noxious stimulation remains a challenge. OBJECTIVES To assess whether guiding remifentanil administration according to the SPI response to a calibrated noxious stimulus (NANCAL) can blunt the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation and surgical incision. DESIGN Randomised multicentre study. SETTING Two Belgian university hospitals from January 2014 to April 2015. PATIENTS After ethic review board approval and informed consent, 48 American Society of Anesthesiologists I or II adult patients scheduled for surgery under general anaesthesia were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to a SPI group, where remifentanil effect-site concentration was adjusted according to NANCAL, or a control group, where it was fixed at 4 ng ml. Propofol concentration was always adjusted to maintain the bispectral index close to 40. NANCAL consisted of a 100 Hz, 60 mA electrical tetanic stimulation during 30 s at the wrist before tracheal intubation and before surgical incision. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary endpoint was the efficacy of the NANCAL-guided remifentanil administration to prevent the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation and surgical incision. The secondary aim was to compare the ability of SPI, analgesia nociception index, pupil diameter and mean arterial pressure response to NANCAL to predict the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation and surgical incision. RESULTS Our SPI response to NANCAL-based correcting scheme for remifentanil administration was not superior to a fixed remifentanil concentration at blunting the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation or surgical incision. Among all tested NAN balance indices, only mean arterial pressure had significant predictive ability with regard to the haemodynamic response to surgical incision. CONCLUSION Further research is needed to define the best NANCAL stimulus and the best remifentanil correcting scheme to help individualised tailoring of antinociception for each specific subpopulation of surgical patients.

METHODS Patients with symptomatic epigastric hernias that were deemed to be too far superior to be repaired with an open technique through an umbilical incision were selected for SIPES repair. Two trocars (5 and 3 mm) were introduced through a single umbilical incision and the hernia repair was performed using looped 4-0 polypropylene sutures introduced through a 17-gage spinal needle in a lasso technique. RESULTS Five girls (age 4.4-12.6, median 6.4 years) underwent single-incision endosurgical epigastric hernia repair. The mean operative time was 25 ± 6 min, and there were no intraoperative complications. All patients were discharged home from the recovery room on the day of surgery. All patients were followed up 2-3 weeks after the operation, with no recurrence and excellent cosmetic results. CONCLUSIONS The described SIPES technique offers a virtually scarless, quick, and simple option for the repair of symptomatic epigastric hernias that can be performed with standard laparoscopic equipment.","Babsail, A A; Abelson, J S; Liska, D; Muensterer, O J",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,103,27

However, few studies have systematically characterized the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in U.S. households (1). Previously reported transmission rates vary widely, and data on transmission rates from children are limited. To assess household transmission, a case-ascertained study was conducted in Nashville, Tennessee, and Marshfield, Wisconsin, commencing in April 2020. In this study, index patients were defined as the first household members with COVID-19-compatible symptoms who received a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result, and who lived with at least one other household member. After enrollment, index patients and household members were trained remotely by study staff members to complete symptom diaries and obtain self-collected specimens, nasal swabs only or nasal swabs and saliva samples, daily for 14 days. For this analysis, specimens from the first 7 days were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using CDC RT-PCR protocols.† A total of 191 enrolled household contacts of 101 index patients reported having no symptoms on the day of the associated index patient's illness onset, and among these 191 contacts, 102 had SARS-CoV-2 detected in either nasal or saliva specimens during follow-up, for a secondary infection rate of 53% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 46%-60%). Among fourteen households in which the index patient was aged <18 years, the secondary infection rate from index patients aged <12 years was 53% (95% CI = 31%-74%) and from index patients aged 12-17 years was 38% (95% CI = 23%-56%). Approximately 75% of secondary infections were identified within 5 days of the index patient's illness onset, and substantial transmission occurred whether the index patient was an adult or a child. Because household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is common and can occur rapidly after the index patient's illness onset, persons should self-isolate immediately at the onset of COVID-like symptoms, at the time of testing as a result of a high risk exposure, or at the time of a positive test result, whichever comes first. Concurrent to isolation, all members of the household should wear a mask when in shared spaces in the household.§.","Grijalva, Carlos G; Rolfes, Melissa A; Zhu, Yuwei; McLean, Huong Q; Hanson, Kayla E; Belongia, Edward A; Halasa, Natasha B; Kim, Ahra; Reed, Carrie; Fry, Alicia M; Talbot, H Keipp",MMWR.

Leukoencephalopathy with microbleeds is increasingly seen in patients with COVID-19. New information is needed to delineate better the clinical implications of this infectious disease. Case report: A 46-year-old man with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe COVID-19. After transfer to the general wards, the patient was noted drowsy, disorientated, with slow thinking and speech. A brain MRI showed bilateral symmetrical hyperintense lesions in the deep and subcortical whiter matter, involving the splenium of the corpus callosum, as well as multiple microhemorrhages implicating the splenium and subcortical white matter. No contrast-enhanced lesions were observed in brain CT or MRI. CSF analysis showed no abnormalities, including a negative rtRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. An outpatient follow-up visit showed near-complete clinical recovery and resolution of the hyperintense lesions on MRI, without microbleeds change. Conclusion: We present the case of a survivor of severe COVID-19 who presented diffuse posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy, and microbleeds masquerading as acute necrotizing encephalopathy. We postulate that this kind of cerebral vasogenic edema with microbleeds could be the consequence of hypoxia, inflammation, the prothrombotic state and medical interventions such as mechanical ventilation and anticoagulation.","Tristán-Samaniego, Dioselina Panamá; Chiquete, Erwin; Treviño-Frenk, Irene; Rubalcava-Ortega, Johnatan; Higuera-Calleja, Jesús Antonio; Romero-Sánchez, Griselda; Espinoza-Alvarado, Lissett; Barrera-Vargas, Ana; Flores-Silva, Fernando; González-Duarte, Alejandra; Vega-Boada, Felipe; Cantú-Brito, Carlos",The International journal of neuroscience,103,12

We also examined how demographics, political partisanship, and skepticism about COVID-19 were associated with the perceived trustworthiness of information sources and decreased trustworthiness over time. At baseline, the majority of respondants reported high trust in COVID-19 information from state health departments (75.6%), the CDC (80.9%), and a university (Johns Hopkins, 81.1%). Mainstream media was trusted by less than half the respondents (41.2%), and the White House was the least trusted source (30.9%). At the 4-month follow-up, a significant decrease in trustworthiness in all five sources of COVID-19 information was observed. The most pronounced reductions were from the CDC and the White House. In multivariate analyses, factors associated with rating the CDC, state health department, and a university as trustworthy sources of COVID-19 information were political party affiliation, level of education, and skepticism about COVID-19. The most consistent predictor of decreased trust was political party affiliation, with Democrats as compared to Republicans less likely to report decreased trust across all sources.","Latkin, Carl A; Dayton, Lauren; Strickland, Justin C; Colon, Brian; Rimal, Rajiv; Boodram, Basmattee",Journal of health communication,103,1

The availability and quality of water will be severely affected, and public health threats from the lack of this valuable resource will be great unless water-scarce nations are able to adapt. Saudi Arabia provides a good example of how the climate and unsustainable human activity go hand in hand in creating stress on and depleting water resources, and an example for adaptation and mitigation. METHOD A search of the English literature addressing climate change, water scarcity, human health, and related topics was conducted using online resources and databases accessed through the University at Albany, State University of New York library web page. RESULTS Water scarcity, which encompasses both water availability and water quality, is an important indicator of health. Beyond drinking, water supply is intimately linked to food security, sanitation, and hygiene, which are primary contributors to the global burden of disease. Poor and disadvantaged populations are the ones who will suffer most from the negative effects of climate change on water supply and associated human health issues. Examples of adaptation and mitigation measures that can help reduce the strain on conventional water resources (surface waters and fossil aquifers or groundwater) include desalination, wastewater recycling and reuse, and outsourcing food items or ""virtual water trade."" These are strategies being used by Saudi Arabia, a country that is water poor primarily due to decades of irresponsible irrigation practices. The human and environmental health risks associated with these adaptation measures are examined. Finally, strategies to protect human health through international collaboration and the importance of these efforts are discussed. CONCLUSION International, multidisciplinary cooperation and collaboration will be needed to promote global water security and to protect human health, particularly in low-income countries that do not have the resources necessary to adapt on their own.","DeNicola, Erica; Aburizaiza, Omar S; Siddique, Azhar; Khwaja, Haider; Carpenter, David O",Annals of global health,103,33

As PPROM is strongly associated with ascending vaginal infection, prophylactic antibiotics are widely used. The evolution of vaginal microbiota compositions associated with PPROM and the impact of antibiotics on bacterial compositions are unknown. METHODS We prospectively assessed vaginal microbiota prior to and following PPROM using MiSeq-based sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons and examined the impact of erythromycin prophylaxis on bacterial load and community structures. RESULTS In contrast to pregnancies delivering at term, vaginal dysbiosis characterised by Lactobacillus spp. depletion was present prior to the rupture of fetal membranes in approximately a third of cases (0% vs. 27%, P = 0.026) and persisted following membrane rupture (31%, P = 0.005). Vaginal dysbiosis was exacerbated by erythromycin treatment (47%, P = 0.00009) particularly in women initially colonised by Lactobacillus spp. Lactobacillus depletion and increased relative abundance of Sneathia spp. were associated with subsequent funisitis and early onset neonatal sepsis. CONCLUSIONS Our data show that vaginal microbiota composition is a risk factor for subsequent PPROM and is associated with adverse short-term maternal and neonatal outcomes. This highlights vaginal microbiota as a potentially modifiable antenatal risk factor for PPROM and suggests that routine use of erythromycin for PPROM be re-examined.","Brown, Richard G; Marchesi, Julian R; Lee, Yun S; Smith, Ann; Lehne, Benjamin; Kindinger, Lindsay M; Terzidou, Vasso; Holmes, Elaine; Nicholson, Jeremy K; Bennett, Phillip R; MacIntyre, David A",BMC medicine,103,1

Therein, this study intends to decode the mechanism of miR-149 in RM. METHODS miR-149 and RUNX2 expression in the chorionic tissues of normal pregnant women and RM patients were first examined, and the correlation between miR-149 and RUNX2 was analyzed. Subsequently, miR-149 was upregulated in HTR-8 cells or downregulated in BEWO cells, and then the changes in biological functions of trophoblasts in RM were detected. Furthermore, the expression of PTEN/Akt signaling pathway-related factors in trophoblasts was detected by western blot analysis. RESULTS miR-149 expression was increased while RUNX2 expression was suppressed in RM patients, and miR-149 was negatively correlated with RUNX2. Overexpressed miR-149 induced cell apoptosis and inhibited cell activity, while reduced miR-149 in trophoblasts contributed to opposite experimental results. Moreover, miR-149 promoted the expression of PTEN and inhibited Akt phosphorylation by targeting RUNX2, thereby inhibiting trophoblast activity and promoting their apoptosis. CONCLUSION Our study demonstrates that miR-149 knockdown halted the RM development through upregulating RUNX2 and activation of the PTEN/Akt signaling pathway.","Wang, Peng; Chen, Xu; Chang, Ying; Wang, Yanping; Xu, Xinran; Guo, Yuling; Cui, Hongyan",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,103,1

Within 14 days after their injuries 22 cases received single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (SB group), while 19 were treated with double-bundle medial collateral ligament reconstruction (DB group). Physical statuses were estimated based on International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and Lysholm scores, Lachman, pivot shift and manual valgus test, and range of motion (ROM), while side-to-side difference was estimated through KT 2000 arthometer.Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction accompanied by conservative treatment showed significantly improved anteroposterior, rotational and valgus stability, and IKDC and Lysholm scores (in comparison to pre-operative status, P < .05). Incidence of pivot shift was dramatically lower in DB group (2/19) than in SB group (7/22 and 2/22; P = .028). No substantial dissimilarity existed between DB and SB groups either in Lachman and valgus tests, KT 2000, ROM, IKDC, or Lysholm scores.Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction accompanied by conservative treatment could achieve outstanding stability and functional manifestations for cases facing anterior cruciate ligament injury accompanied by grade 2 medial collateral ligament injury. Moreover, double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is superior to single-bundle operation in treating rotational instability of the knee.Level of evidence: Retrospective comparative study, Level III.","Chen, Lian-Xu; Wang, Hong-Hong",Medicine,103,1

METHODS AIS patients with LVO who underwent EVT in the period of January 1st to April 30th between 2015 and 2020 from our stroke center. The baseline characteristics, working flow time, safety and efficacy outcome and the hospitalization status were retrospectively reviewed, compared and analyzed. RESULTS There is significant decline in the number of AIS patients with LVO treated compared with the previous year (36 Vs 72 patients) during the epidemic period. The door to puncture time was significantly prolong (225 minutes versus 115 minutes) as well as the length of hospital stay with increase of the hospitalization costs (P < 0.05 for all). There is no significant difference on the safety and efficacy outcome, such recanalization rate, incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, functional independence and mortality during the epidemic (P > 0.05 for all).

METHODS A retrospective analysis of 207 neurosurgical patients using intraoperative MRI was performed. A group of 86 patients was treated with the additional use of intraoperative and postoperative pneumatic compression until mobilization out of bed. One hundred twenty-one patients were treated without the use of additional pneumatic compression. Postoperatively the patients were screened for deep venous thrombosis by ultrasound and pulmonary embolism by CT-scan if suspicious. Statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS The development of deep venous thrombosis was reduced from 9.9% to 3.5% in our patients with the additional use of intraoperative and postoperative pneumatic compression. That is a 64.6% relative risk reduction to develop deep venous thrombosis with the use of intraoperative and postoperative pneumatic compression. An additional 52% relative risk reduction was found for the chance of developing pulmonary embolism. In the 15 patients with detected deep venous thrombosis, the OR-time was more than 100 min longer than in the 192 patients without detected deep venous thrombosis. The difference between both groups was significant. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates the benefit of pneumatic compression with a risk reduction for the development of thromboembolic complications. OR-time is another risk factor that attributes to a significant risk for the development of thromboembolic complications.","Frisius, Jobst; Ebeling, Marcel; Karst, Matthias; Fahlbusch, Rudolf; Schedel, Ingolf; Gerganov, Venelin; Samii, Amir; Lüdemann, Wolf",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,103,29

OBJECTIVES To estimate the prevalence of deficiency or insufficiency of vitamins C and E and associated factors among women of childbearing age, in Brazil. DESIGN AND SETTING Systematic review and meta-analysis conducted at a Brazilian public university. METHODS A search from index inception until May 2020 was conducted. Meta-analyses were performed using inverse variance for fixed models, with summary proportions calculation using Freeman-Tukey double arcsine (base case). Reporting and methodological quality were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool for prevalence studies. RESULTS Our review identified 12 studies, comprising 1,316 participants, especially breastfeeding women. There was at least one quality weakness in all studies, mainly regarding sampling method (i.e. convenience sampling) and small sample size. The prevalence of vitamin C deficiency ranged from 0% to 40%. Only vitamin E deficiency was synthetized in meta-analyses, with mean prevalences of 6% regardless of the alpha-tocopherol cutoff in plasma, and 5% and 16% for cutoffs of < 1.6-12.0 mmol/l and < 16.2 mmol/l, respectively. The cumulative meta-analysis suggested that a trend to lower prevalence of vitamin E deficiency occurred in recent studies. CONCLUSIONS Although the studies identified in this systematic review had poor methodological and reporting quality, mild-moderate vitamin C and E deficiencies were identified, especially in breastfeeding women. Thus, designing and implementing policies does not seem to be a priority, because the need has not been properly dimensioned among women of childbearing age in Brazil.

Health outcomes in pediatric diabetes are currently poor, with trends indicating that they are worsening. Minority racial/ethnic groups are disproportionately affected by suboptimal glucose control and have a higher risk of acute and chronic complications of diabetes. Correct clinical management starts with timely and accurate classification of diabetes, but in children this is becoming increasingly challenging due to high prevalence of obesity and shifting demographic composition. The growing obesity epidemic complicates classification by obesity's effects on diabetes. Since the prevalence and clinical characteristics of diabetes vary among racial/ethnic groups, migration between countries leads to changes in the distribution of diabetes types in a certain geographical area, challenging the clinician's ability to classify diabetes. These challenges must be addressed to correctly classify diabetes and establish an appropriate treatment strategy early in the course of disease for all.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Each 50 consecutive patients with totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with RY and BI were enrolled in this study. Technical safety and surgical outcomes of RY were evaluated in comparison with BI. RESULTS In all patients, RY gastrectomy using linear staplers was safely performed without any events during surgery. The mean operation time and anastomosis time were 177.0±37.6 min and 14.4±5.6 min for RY, respectively, which were significantly longer than those for BI (150.4±34.0 min and 5.9±2.2 min, respectively). There were no differences in amount of blood loss, time to flatus passage, diet start, length of hospital stay, and postoperative inflammatory response between the two groups. Although there was no significant difference in surgical complications between RY and BI (6.0% and 14.0%), the RY group showed no anastomosis site-related complications. CONCLUSION The double stapling method using linear staplers in totally laparoscopic RY reconstruction is a simple and safe procedure.","An, Ji Yeong; Cho, In; Choi, Yoon Young; Kim, Yoo Min; Noh, Sung Hoon",Yonsei medical journal,103,1

There are strong demands for new and safe therapies to control resistant hypertension while addressing its common causes, specifically poor compliance to lifelong polypharmacy, lifestyle modifications, and physician inertia. The sympathetic nervous system plays a significant pathophysiological role in hypertension. Surgical sympathectomy for blood pressure reduction is an old but extremely efficacious therapeutic concept, now abandoned with the dawn of a safer contemporary pharmacology era. Recently, clinical studies have revealed promising results for safe and sustained blood pressure reduction with percutaneous renal sympathetic denervation. This is a novel, minimally invasive, device-based therapy, specifically targeting and ablating the renal artery nerves with radiofrequency waves without permanent implantation. There are also reported additional benefits in related comorbidities, such as impaired glucose metabolism, renal impairment, left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and others. This review focuses on how selective renal sympathetic denervation works, its present and potential therapeutic indications, and its future directions.","Leong, Kui Toh Gerard; Walton, Antony; Krum, Henry",Annual review of medicine,103,26

They are associated with mortality or lower growth rate and induce treatment costs. Enteric and respiratory pathogens can be transmitted via contacts between calves, which depend on calf housing systems and management. This study aimed at describing the main calf housing systems across Europe and at assessing the consequences of such housing facilities in terms of risk for calf infectious diseases. This was done through the use of a questionnaire distributed to experts in epidemiology and cattle farming systems in each European country. A literature review was performed on the risk factors associated with calf infectious diseases transmission and targeted in the questionnaire. Answers from 14 countries were obtained. A wide range of housing systems were described. However, four main systems could be identified and ranked in ascending order of risk for neonatal diarrhoea and respiratory infectious diseases: individual pen until weaning, individual pen for 4 weeks, individual pen for 2 weeks, and collective pen from the separation of the calf with its dam. Although the housing systems are known to play a role in disease transmission, they are currently not fully described in literature concerning risk factors for calf infectious diseases. In a given farm, the risk assessment for calf infectious diseases should consider classical risk factors such as hygiene, feeding practices and air conditioning, on top of a precise description of the housing system.","Marcé, C; Guatteo, R; Bareille, N; Fourichon, C",Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,103,27

Its major disadvantage is a laparotomy incision with potential bowel injury, adhesions, or hernia. Over the past 20 years, the authors' technique has evolved to use a transdiaphragmatic opening for omental harvest when possible. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 140 consecutive patients undergoing omental flap harvest for treatment of sternal wounds following median sternotomy. Patients were divided into two groups by access incision: laparotomy incision (n = 80) versus a transdiaphragmatic opening (n = 60). RESULTS The authors found that both techniques provided reliable closure of sternal wounds, but the transdiaphragmatic approach was faster, with less blood loss. There was no significant difference in rates of ventral hernias. We had only one bowel injury (laparotomy group) and no postoperative abdominal bleeding or small bowel obstruction. CONCLUSION Transdiaphragmatic omental harvest provides safe and efficient coverage of deep sternal wounds without a laparotomy incision.","Vyas, Raj M; Prsic, Adnan; Orgill, Dennis P",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,103,27

Few studies have reported COVID-19 specific tracheotomy outcomes, and the optimal timing and patient selection criteria for tracheotomy remains undetermined. We delineate our outcomes for tracheotomies performed on COVID-19 patients during the peak of the pandemic at a major epicenter in the United States. METHODS This is a retrospective observational cohort study. Mortality, ventilation liberation rate, complication rate, and decannulation rate were analyzed. RESULTS 64 patients with COVID-19 underwent tracheotomy between April 1, 2020 to May 19, 2020 at two tertiary care hospitals in Bronx, New York. The average duration of intubation prior to tracheotomy was 20 days (IQR 16.5-26.0). The mortality rate was 33% (n = 21), the ventilation liberation rate was 47% (n = 30), the decannulation rate was 28% (n = 18), and the complication rate was 19% (n = 12). Tracheotomies performed by Otolaryngology were associated with significantly improved survival (p < 0.05) with 60% of patients alive at the conclusion of the study compared to 9%, 12% and 19% of patients undergoing tracheotomy performed by Critical Care, General Surgery, and Pulmonology, respectively. CONCLUSION To date this is the second largest study describing tracheotomy outcomes in COVID-19 patients in the United States. Our early outcomes demonstrate successful ventilation liberation and decannulation in COVID-19 patients. Further inquiry is necessary to determine the optimal timing and identification of patient risk factors predictive of improved survival in COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheotomy.

The specific recognition of DNA modifications by the transcriptional protein machinery is thought to be a potential mechanism for epigenetic-driven gene regulation, and many modified DNA-specific binding proteins have been uncovered. However, the panoramic view of the roles of DNA modification readers at the proteome level remains largely unclear. Here, a recently developed concatenated tandem array of consensus transcription factor (TF) response elements (catTFREs) approach is employed to profile the binding activity of TFs at DNA modifications. Modified DNA-binding activity is quantified for 1039 TFs, representing 70% of the TFs in the human genome. Additionally, the modified DNA-binding activity of 600 TFs is monitored during the mouse brain development from the embryo to the adult stages. Readers of these DNA modifications are predicted, and the hierarchical networks between the transcriptional protein machinery and modified DNA are described. It is further demonstrated that ZNF24 and ZSCAN21 are potential readers of 5fC-modified DNA. This study provides a landscape of TF-DNA modification interactions that can be used to elucidate the epigenetic-related transcriptional regulation mechanisms under physiological conditions.","Bai, Lin; Yang, Guojian; Qin, Zhaoyu; Lyu, Jiacheng; Wang, Yunzhi; Feng, Jinwen; Liu, Mingwei; Gong, Tongqing; Li, Xianju; Li, Zhengyang; Li, Jixi; Qin, Jun; Yang, Wenjun; Ding, Chen",Advanced science,103,15

Increasing evidence shows that exosomes (Exos) secreted by adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) can be used to deliver circular RNAs (circRNAs) to treat liver fibrosis. To explore the uses of circRNA, circRNA expression profiles of hepatic tissue from normal and CCl4-induced mice were analyzed using high-throughput circRNA microarrays. The result showed that mmu_circ_0000623 expression was downregulated in CCl4-induced mice. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferin reporter experiments showed that mmu_circ_0000623 interacted with and regulated miR-125/ATG4D. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that Exos from ADSCs, especially from mmu_circ_0000623-modified ADSCs, significantly suppressed CCl4-induced liver fibrosis by promoting autophagy activation. Autophagy inhibitor treatment significantly reversed the treatment effects of Exos. Proteins involved in autophagy and autophagy plaques positive for ATG4D expression were regulated by mmu_circ_0000623/miR-125.

A new true two-resolution imaging X-ray detector system features a 194 µm pixel conventional flat-panel detector (FPD) mode and a 76 µm pixel high-resolution high-definition (Hi-Def) zoom mode in one detector panel. The Hi-Def zoom mode was developed for use in interventional procedures requiring superior image quality over a small field of view (FOV). We report successful use of this imaging system during intracranial aneurysm treatment in 1 patient with a Pipeline-embolization device and 1 patient with a low-profile visualized intramural support (LVIS Blue) device plus adjunctive coiling. METHODS A guide catheter was advanced from the femoral artery insertion site to the proximity of each lesion using standard FPD mode. Under magnified small FOV Hi-Def imaging mode, an intermediate catheter and microcatheters were guided to the treatment site, and the PED and LVIS Blue plus coils were deployed. Radiation doses were tracked intraprocedurally. RESULTS Critical details, including structural changes in the PED and LVIS Blue and position and movement of the microcatheter tip within the coil mass, were more readily apparent in Hi-Def mode. Skin-dose mapping indicated that Hi-Def mode limited radiation exposure to the smaller FOV of the treatment area. CONCLUSIONS Visualization of device structures was much improved in the high-resolution Hi-Def mode, leading to easier, more controlled deployment of stents and coils than conventional FPD mode.","Setlur Nagesh, Swetadri Vasan; Vakharia, Kunal; Waqas, Muhammad; Fennell, Vernard S; Atwal, Gursant S; Shallwani, Hussain; Bednarek, Daniel R; Davies, Jason M; Snyder, Kenneth V; Mokin, Maxim; Rudin, Stephen; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,103,1

However, concerns exist that this strategy may lead to more crowded hospitals, longer wait times and poorer service, adversely impacting health outcomes for clients with severe disease. We assessed how UTT was related to markers of disease progression in PLHIV overall and specifically among clients with low CD4 count/high World Health Organization (WHO) stage. METHODS The analysis was conducted using data from a stepped-wedge trial of UTT in 14 government-managed health facilities in Eswatini from 2014 to 2017. Disease progression was defined as CD4 count falling below 200 cells/µL or baseline value, > 10% weight loss, body mass index (BMI) dropping below 18.5, incident tuberculosis (TB) or HIV-related death; these outcomes also were assessed individually. We assessed multivariate Cox proportional hazard models overall and specifically among clients with CD4 count < 350 cells/μL or WHO stage 3-4 at enrolment. RESULTS Eight hundred and seven of 3176 clients demonstrated at least one marker of disease progression over 2339 person-years of follow-up. Overall, 62.4% of clients were female; 57.2% were < 35 years old. Compared to clients not exposed to UTT, those exposed to UTT had a lower rate of disease progression overall [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.60; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-0.78] and a lower rate of CD4 decline (aHR 0.40; 95% CI 0.27-0.58). When the analysis was limited to clients with CD4 count < 350 cells/μL or WHO stage 3-4, UTT was not associated with disease progression (aHR 0.92; 95% CI 0.66-1.29). CONCLUSIONS UTT reduced HIV disease progression overall and was not detrimental for clients with more severe disease.","Boeke, C E; Khan, S; Walsh, F; Hettema, A; Lejeune, C; Spiegelman, D; Okello, V; Harwell, J; Mazibuko, S; Bärnighausen, T",HIV medicine,103,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 117 patients who received RE for HCC from 2 academic centers were reviewed and stratified by ALBI grade, C-P class, and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage. The overall survival (OS) according to these 3 criteria was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The utilities of C-P class and ALBI grade as prognostic indicators were compared using the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify additional predictive factors. RESULTS Patients with ALBI grade 1 (n=49) had superior OS than those with ALBI grade 2 (n=65) (P=0.01). Meanwhile, no significant difference was observed in OS between C-P class A (n=100) and C-P class B (n=14) (P=0.11). For C-P class A patients, the ALBI grade (1 vs. 2) was able to stratify 2 clear and nonoverlapping subgroups with differing OS curves (P=0.03). Multivariate Cox regression test identified alanine transaminase, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage, and ALBI grade as the strongest prognostic factors for OS (P<0.10). CONCLUSIONS ALBI grade as a prognosticator has demonstrated clear survival discrimination that is superior to C-P class among HCC patients treated with RE, particularly within the subgroup of C-P class A patients. ALBI grade is useful for clinicians to make decisions as to whether RE should be recommended to patients with HCC.","Gui, Bin; Weiner, Ashley A; Nosher, John; Lu, Shou-En; Foltz, Gretchen M; Hasan, Omar; Kim, Seung K; Gendel, Vyacheslav; Mani, Naganathan B; Carpizo, Darren R; Saad, Nael E; Kennedy, Timothy J; Zuckerman, Darryl A; Olsen, Jeffrey R; Parikh, Parag J; Jabbour, Salma K",American journal of clinical oncology,103,31

It seems that the number of infected people has subsided, however, the increasing human activities again in the resumption of economy may lead to the second wave of infections. Here, we analyzed the major factors behind the success control of the first outbreak in Japan and the potential risk of the second wave. Methods Employing a localized stochastic transition model, we analyze the real data and the results of simulation in Tokyo from March 1 to July 31. In the model, population is divided into three compartments: susceptible, infected, and removed; and area into three zones: crowded, mid and uncrowded. Different zones have different infection probabilities characterized by the number of people gathered there. The flow of the infection simulation in one day consists of three steps: (I) intercity movement of population, (II) isolating infected people, and (III) zone shifting following group behavioral patterns. Results The major cause for the success of controlling the first outbreak in Tokyo is demonstrated through our simulation to be the early request of self-restraint as well as the early detection of infected people. Meanwhile, the observation that the increasing human activities again in the resumption of economy will lead to the second wave of infections is also found in the simulation with an extended period. Based on the analysis of intercity movement and behavioral pattern on Tokyo where normally about 2.9 million people come from the surrounding cities to the central area by using the public railway system every day, results showed that turning the workstyle of 55% of working people ranging in age from 20 to 64 years old into teleworking (remote work) may control the spread of infection without significant economic damage. Meanwhile, to keep about 75% of the normal activity level and to advocate the shift to telework are indispensable because a sudden resumption of activity from the lockdown sate can rapidly spread infection. Conclusions As a new normal in face of COVID-19 for Tokyo and other cities that with a high population density, shifting the workstyle of 55% of working people to teleworking and to reduce 25% time staying in the high infection risk area could be an effective measure to control the spread of infection while maintaining a certain level of economic activity.","Karako, Kenji; Song, Peipei; Chen, Yu; Tang, Wei",Annals of translational medicine,103,1

OBJECTIVES We aimed to study whether the hemostatic status in ACLF is merely an exaggeration from the status in patients with compensated and acutely decompensated cirrhosis, or whether sepsis-associated hemostatic changes contribute. METHODS We performed extensive hemostatic profiling in 31 adult patients with ACLF, 20 patients with sepsis without underlying CLD, and 40 healthy controls. RESULTS We found similarly elevated plasma levels of the platelet adhesive protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) and decreased levels of the VWF-regulating protease ADAMTS13 in both groups compared to healthy controls. In vivo markers of activation of coagulation (TAT, D-dimer) were similarly elevated in both groups compared to controls, but ex vivo thrombin generating capacity was similar between patients and controls, despite a much more profound INR elevation in ACLF. Plasma fibrinogen levels were much higher in septics, which was accompanied by a decreased ex vivo clot permeability and an increased in ex vivo resistance to clot lysis. All hemostatic parameters were remarkably stable over the first 10 days after admission. CONCLUSIONS We have found hemostatic changes in ACLF to partially overlap with that of patients with sepsis, and evidence of preserved hemostatic capacity in both patient groups. The notable difference was a profound hyperfibrinogenemia, associated with a thrombogenic clot structure and a marked ex-vivo resistance to fibrinolysis in patients with sepsis.","Lisman, Ton; Arefaine, Bethlehem; Adelmeijer, Jelle; Zamalloa, Ane; Corcoran, Eleanor; Smith, John G; Bernal, William; Patel, Vishal C",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,103,1

METHODS One hundred seven consecutive pneumonectomies performed at an experienced center from January 2002 to December 2012 were studied retrospectively. Forty cases were open, and 50 successful VATS and 17 conversions were combined (intent-to-treat [ITT] analysis). RESULTS The VATS cohort had more preoperative comorbidities (three vs two, P = .003), women (57% vs 30%, P = .009), and older ages (65 years vs 63 years, P = .07). Although advanced clinical stage was less for VATS (26% vs 50% stage III, P = .035), final pathologic staging was similar (25% vs 38%, P = .77). Pursuing a VATS approach yielded similar complications (two vs two, median, P = .73) with no catastrophic intraoperative events like bleeding. Successful VATS pneumonectomy rates rose from 50%-82% by the second half of the series (P < .001). Completion pneumonectomy cases (13.4% VATS, 7.5% open) had similar outcomes. Having similar initial discomforts as patients undergoing open surgery, more patients undergoing VATS were pain-free at 1 year (53% vs 19%, P = .03). Conversions resulted in longer ICU stays (4 days vs 2 days, P = .01). Advanced clinical stage (III-IV) ITT VATS had longer median overall survival (OS) (42 months vs 13 months, log-rank P = .042).

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 who had been discharged or expired were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into corticosteroid group and non-corticosteroid group according to the systemic corticosteroid use or not. Clinical data were collected, and hospital mortality, hospital length of stay, time of viral clearance, time of mechanical ventilation, and duration from illness onset to symptom resolution were compared between the two groups. RESULTS A total of 72 inpatients who were diagnosed with severe and critical COVID-19 were enrolled, in which 47 patients were divided into corticosteroid group and 25 were involved as the non-corticosteroid group. Baseline characteristics were generally similar between the two groups. Four (5.6%) patients died during hospitalization, and 68 (94.4%) were discharged. Among survivors, the mean duration time from admission to discharge was 19.5d (SD 7.05 d). The mean time of viral clearance among survivors was 17.5d (SD 7.67 d), with a maximum of 37 d, and a minimum of 5 d. Hospital mortality (4.3% vs. 8.0%), length of hospital stay (18.7d vs. 21.0d), and time of viral clearance (16.1d vs. 19.4d) had no significant difference between two groups (p>0.05). The duration of symptoms suffering was shorter in the corticosteroid group than non-corticosteroid group, with statistically significant difference (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Corticosteroid therapy in patients with severe COVID-19 cannot reduce the hospital mortality, and is not associated with delayed viral clearance, but it could relieve the inflammatory storm and improve clinical symptoms in brief. Patients with severe COVID-19 could benefit from low-dose corticosteroid treatment.","Ma, Q; Qi, D; Deng, X-Y; Yuan, G-D; Tian, W-G; Cui, Y; Yan, X-F; Wang, D-X",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,103,0

Concerns have been expressed that, at their most extreme, these consequences could manifest as increased suicide rates. We aimed to assess the early effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates around the world. METHODS We sourced real-time suicide data from countries or areas within countries through a systematic internet search and recourse to our networks and the published literature. Between Sept 1 and Nov 1, 2020, we searched the official websites of these countries' ministries of health, police agencies, and government-run statistics agencies or equivalents, using the translated search terms ""suicide"" and ""cause of death"", before broadening the search in an attempt to identify data through other public sources. Data were included from a given country or area if they came from an official government source and were available at a monthly level from at least Jan 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020. Our internet searches were restricted to countries with more than 3 million residents for pragmatic reasons, but we relaxed this rule for countries identified through the literature and our networks. Areas within countries could also be included with populations of less than 3 million. We used an interrupted time-series analysis to model the trend in monthly suicides before COVID-19 (from at least Jan 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020) in each country or area within a country, comparing the expected number of suicides derived from the model with the observed number of suicides in the early months of the pandemic (from April 1 to July 31, 2020, in the primary analysis). FINDINGS We sourced data from 21 countries (16 high-income and five upper-middle-income countries), including whole-country data in ten countries and data for various areas in 11 countries). Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs based on the observed versus expected numbers of suicides showed no evidence of a significant increase in risk of suicide since the pandemic began in any country or area. There was statistical evidence of a decrease in suicide compared with the expected number in 12 countries or areas: New South Wales, Australia (RR 0·81 [95% CI 0·72-0·91]); Alberta, Canada (0·80 [0·68-0·93]); British Columbia, Canada (0·76 [0·66-0·87]); Chile (0·85 [0·78-0·94]); Leipzig, Germany (0·49 [0·32-0·74]); Japan (0·94 [0·91-0·96]); New Zealand (0·79 [0·68-0·91]); South Korea (0·94 [0·92-0·97]); California, USA (0·90 [0·85-0·95]); Illinois (Cook County), USA (0·79 [0·67-0·93]); Texas (four counties), USA (0·82 [0·68-0·98]); and Ecuador (0·74 [0·67-0·82]). INTERPRETATION This is the first study to examine suicides occurring in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple countries. In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, suicide numbers have remained largely unchanged or declined in the early months of the pandemic compared with the expected levels based on the pre-pandemic period. We need to remain vigilant and be poised to respond if the situation changes as the longer-term mental health and economic effects of the pandemic unfold.

However, many problems have arisen concerning the quality and identity of materials sold in the market under these two names. Thus, the identification of Daqingye and Banlangen has drawn public attention. In this work, transverse sections of Daqingye and Banlangen from I. indigotica Fort. and two easily confused species, namely Baphicacanthus cusia (Nees) Bremek. and Clerodendrum cyrtophyllum Turcz., were investigated with normal light and fluorescence microscopy. The distinguishing features were 7-9 vascular bundles, cystoliths and nonglandular hairs in the leaves of I. indigotica, B. cusia, and C. cyrtophyllum, respectively. The Banlangen could be distinguished according to the characteristics of parenchymous cells, cystoliths, and stone cells. Moreover, the fluorescence features of Daqingye and Banlangen investigated in this study can provide direct points for differentiating those samples. Importantly, whether the crude drugs were decocted could be easily identified by their different fluorescence features, which can ensure their quality in clinical application. This is the first report to distinguish the three species that are commonly found in the market sold as Daqingye and Banlangen by normal light and fluorescence microscopy. This work indicates that the combination of normal light and fluorescence microscopy could be powerful, convenient, and economical for authenticating Daqingye and Banlangen from the three species, including crude drugs and decoction dregs.","Xiaojing, Wan; Liang, Zhitao; Chen, Hu-Biao; Zhao, Zhongzhen; Li, Ping",Microscopy research and technique,103,19

We aimed to determine whether APOL1 genotype status (high risk = 2 risk alleles; low risk = 0-1 risk alleles) and self-reported race (Black; White) are associated with number of hospitalizations, incident chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and mortality among older adults participating in a community-based cohort study. DESIGN Observational longitudinal cohort study. SETTING The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. PARTICIPANTS Community-dwelling older adults (mean age = 75.8 years; range = 66-90 years). RESULTS Among 5,564 ARIC participants (78.2% White, 19.1% APOL1 low-risk Black, and 2.7% APOL1 high-risk Black), the proportion with creatinine and cystatin C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFRCrCys ) below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline was 40.6%, 34.8%, and 43.2%, respectively. Over a mean follow-up of 5.1 years, APOL1 high-risk Blacks had a 2.67-fold higher risk for ESRD compared with low-risk Blacks (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-6.79) in models adjusted for age and sex. This association was no longer significant upon further adjustment for baseline eGFRCrCys and albuminuria (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.08; 95% CI = .39-2.96). Rate of hospitalizations and risks of mortality and incident CKD did not differ significantly by APOL1 genotype status. Compared with Whites, Blacks had 1.85-fold and 3.45-fold higher risks for incident CKD and ESRD, respectively, in models adjusted for age, sex, eGFRCrCys , and albuminuria. These associations persisted after additional adjustments for clinical/socioeconomic factors and APOL1 genotype (incident CKD: HR = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.06-1.81; ESRD: HR = 3.20; 95% CI = 1.16-8.86). CONCLUSION Among older Black adults, APOL1 high-risk genotypes were associated with lower kidney function and therefore higher risk of ESRD. Racial disparities in incident kidney disease persisted in older age and were not fully explained by APOL1.","Chen, Teresa K; Coresh, Josef; Daya, Natalie; Ballew, Shoshana H; Tin, Adrienne; Crews, Deidra C; Grams, Morgan E",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,103,12

MATERIALS AND METHODS This single center, retrospective review of prospectively collected data was conducted for obese patients that underwent LGCP or LSG from March 2013 to February 2016. These two patient groups were compared in terms of demographics, perioperative outcomes, weight loss [percent excess weight loss (%EWL)], comorbidity resolution, and immediate and long-term complications. RESULTS A total of 149 patients were eligible for the study. Seventy-five patients underwent LGCP (group A) and 74 LSG (group B). These two groups were matched for age, gender, and baseline BMI. Three patients in each group were readmitted for complications within 30 days postoperatively. %EWL in groups A and B were 51.1±16.9 and 47.8±20.8 at 3 months (p=0.084), 71.1±20.2 and 74.5±21.8 at 6 months (p=0.165), 77.1±18.4 and 87.8±25.1 at 12 months (p=0.002), 70.5±18.5 and 83.4±28.7 at 24 months (p=0.005), and 67.3±15.3 and 78.6±31.7 at 36 months (p=0.054), respectively. Intergroup differences in resolution rates of metabolic comorbidities between the two groups were not significant. CONCLUSION Although mean weight loss after LGCP was inferior to that after LSG, especially after six months postoperatively, it was acceptable, and LGCP had an excellent metabolic comorbidity resolution rate in patients with BMIs, ranging from 30 to 35 kg/m².","Park, Yeon Ho; Kim, Seong Min",Yonsei medical journal,103,16

Our purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this suture for renorrhaphy during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN). PATIENTS AND METHODS Thirteen consecutive patients underwent LPN using V-Loc™ 180 (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) suture, and a nonconsecutive control group of 24 patients, matched according to tumor size and R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score, underwent LPN using absorbable polyglactin suture. All 37 patients underwent LPN performed by a single surgeon. Perioperative and postoperative indicators of morbidity, estimated blood loss, and warm ischemia time (WIT) were compared between the groups. RESULTS Baseline characteristics including age, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, tumor size, laterality, and R.E.N.A.L nephrometry score were identical between the groups. On multivariable analysis, there were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to operative time, estimated blood loss, transfusion rates, rates of surgical complications, and length of hospital stay. However, mean WIT was significantly shorter in the V-Loc group compared with the control group (24.5±5.3 minutes versus 31.9±8.9 minutes, P=.01). CONCLUSIONS The use of V-Loc sutures for renorrhaphy during LPN is safe and feasible and, in our series, significantly reduces WIT. Further studies are needed to corroborate these findings, but these results indicate a promising development in reducing WIT during minimally invasive partial nephrectomy.","Jeon, Seung Hyun; Jung, Saebin; Son, Hee-Seo; Kimm, Simon Y; Chung, Benjamin I",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

We describe our experience of using the V-Y principle in advancement flaps designed around a distinct perforator to reconstruct soft tissue defects of the upper limb. The shortcomings of fasciocutaneous and fascial flaps requiring skin grafting can be eliminated. METHODS This was a 10-year retrospective review of patients who had V-Y flaps based on a distinct perforator for defects of the shoulder, axilla, arm, elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand. Defects of the digits and thumb were excluded. RESULTS There were 59 flaps in 52 patients with an average age of 44 years (18-72 years). Skin malignancy was the most common primary etiology. The average defect size was 35 cm (9-80 cm). There were no total flap failures; however, there were 4 partial losses, which healed by secondary intention. Seven flaps had to be explored for the hematoma evacuation. CONCLUSIONS The use of V-Y flaps based on distinct perforators in the upper limb retains limb aesthetics, allows early mobility and is a safe and reliable technique.","Kennedy, Anne-Marie; Lloyd, Mark Sheldon; Niranjan, Niri S",Annals of plastic surgery,103,1

Following Jaques's work, the midlife crisis became a popular means of describing how-and why-men and women around the age of 40 became disillusioned with work, disenchanted with relationships and detached from family responsibilities. Post-war sociological and psychological studies of middle age regarded the midlife crisis as a manifestation of either biological or psychological change, as a moment in the life course when-perhaps for the first time-people felt themselves to be declining towards death. Although the midlife crisis has often been dismissed as a myth or satirized in novels and films, the concept has persisted not only in stereotypical depictions of rebellion and infidelity at midlife, but also in research that has sought to explain the particular social, physical and emotional challenges of middle age. In the spirit of the pioneering research of John Wilkins, John Bernal and Peter Medawar, each of whom in different ways emphasized the complex interrelations between science and society, I want to argue that the emergence of the midlife crisis-as concept and experience-during the middle decades of the twentieth century was not coincidental. Rather it was the product of historically specific demographic changes and political aspirations-at least in the Western world-to keep alive the American dream of economic progress and material prosperity.","Jackson, Mark",Notes and records of the Royal Society of London,103,10

We evaluated CyMol, an alcohol-based transport medium, for its ability to maintain specimen integrity for up to 21 days of storage at various temperatures; for its ability to inactivate virus; and for its compatibility with antigen- or nucleic acid-based diagnostics for respiratory viruses in clinical samples. In mock-infected samples, both universal transport medium (UTM-RT) and CyMol maintained equivalent viral quantities for at least 14 days at room temperature or colder, whereas a dry swab collection maintained viral quantities only if refrigerated or frozen. CyMol inactivated influenza virus within 5 min of sample immersion. UTM-RT- and CyMol-collected nasal swab specimens from 73 symptomatic students attending a campus health clinic were positive for a respiratory virus in 56.2% of subjects by multiplex PCR testing, including influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus/enteroviruses, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, metapneumovirus, and adenovirus. Detection by PCR was equivalent in UTM-RT- and CyMol-collected specimens and in self- and staff-collected swabs. Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing was substantially less sensitive (23.3%) than multiplex PCR, and DFA testing from UTM-RT-collected swabs was more sensitive than that from CyMol-collected swabs. These data indicate that an alcohol-based transport medium such as CyMol preserves respiratory virus integrity, rapidly inactivates viruses, and is compatible with PCR-based respiratory diagnostics.","Luinstra, Kathy; Petrich, Astrid; Castriciano, Santina; Ackerman, Mona; Chong, Sylvia; Carruthers, Susan; Ammons, Brenna; Mahony, James B; Smieja, Marek",Journal of clinical microbiology,103,24

METHODS This retrospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study examined data from JMDC Inc., an administrative claims database. Patients with HbA1c value of at least 6.5% at routine annual check, aged 20 years or older, and prescribed at least one antidiabetic drug were included. This cohort was classified into early physician visit and delayed physician visit groups based on the timing of the first physician visit relative to the median. Patients were monitored from the date of first HbA1c checkup of at least 6.5% to the date of first physician visit with an HbA1c test, and from the date of the first physician visit to the date of prescription of first-line and second-line T2DM treatments. The time to first prescription of antidiabetic treatment for the two groups was then compared. RESULTS Of 4798 eligible patients, 54.8% were prescribed first-line T2DM therapy less than 2 months from the first physician visit for T2DM diagnosis. A lower percentage of the early group compared with the delayed group required T2DM pharmacological therapy in less than 2 months (46.1% vs. 63.4%). The early group had a longer median time to prescription of first-line therapy [92 days vs. 15 days, p < 0.0001; hazard ratio (HR) 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24, 1.39] and second-line therapy (1599 days vs. 1315 days, p < 0.0001; HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.11, 1.34) compared with the delayed group.

This study aimed to review the clinical features of VBA involvement in trigeminal neuralgia and evaluate surgical decompression techniques in the long term. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the surgical outcomes of 26 patients (4.4%) with VBA involvement in 585 consecutive MVDs for TGN using a Teflon roll for repositioning the VBA. The final operative status of the nerve decompression was categorized into two groups: the separation group and the contact group. Separation of the VBA from the nerve root was completed in 13 patients in the separation group, and slight vascular contact remained in the remaining 13 patients of the contact group. The clinical features of VBA-related TGN were investigated and the operative results were analyzed. RESULTS Multiple arteries are involved in neurovascular compression (NVC) in most cases. The anterior inferior cerebellar artery was the most common concomitant artery (69%). The site of the NVC varies from the root entry zone to the distal portion of the root. All patients were pain-free immediately after surgery and maintained medication-free status during the follow-up period, except for one patient (3.8%) who had recurrent facial pain 8 years after surgery. Postoperative facial numbness was observed in six patients (23%). Of these, one patient showed improvement within 3 months and the other five patients had persistent facial numbness (19.2%). Other neurological deficits include one dry eye, one diplopia due to trochlear nerve palsy, two decreased hearing (< 50 db), two facial weaknesses, and two cerebellar ataxia. Although most of them were transient, one dry eye, two hearing impairments, and one cerebellar ataxia became persistent deficits. Statistical analyses revealed no difference in surgical efficacy or complications in the long term between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Slightly remaining vascular contact does not affect pain relief in the long term. Our study indicated that once the tense trigeminal nerve is loosened, further attempts to mobilize the VBA are not necessary.","Inoue, Takuro; Shitara, Satoshi; Goto, Yukihiro; Prasetya, Mustaqim; Fukushima, Takanori",Acta neurochirurgica,103,1

In this paper, structured as a literature review, we describe the current knowledge and the technical improvements currently employed in the field of thyroid surgery, focusing on the contribution of energy based devices in relation with the reduction of the operating time and the odds of possible complication. Materials and methods: a relevant systematic literature search on Pubmed was carried out including works from 2004 through 2019, selecting studies providing information on the energy based devices employed in surgeries and statistic data concerning RNL (transient and permanent) injury and operative time. Results: Nineteen studies were reviewed, dealing with 4468 patients in total. The operative variables considered in this study are: employed device, number of patients, pathological conditions affecting the patients, surgical treatment, RNL injury percentage and the operating time, offering an insight on different patient conditions and their relative operative outcomes. A total of 1843 patients, accounting to the 41.2% of the total pool, underwent the traditional technique operation, while 2605 patients (58.3%) were treated employing the energy based devices techniques. Thyroidectomy performed by approaches different from traditional (for example robotic, MIVAT (Mini Invasive Video Assisted thyroidectomy)) were excluded from this study. Conclusions: The energy-based vessel sealing devices in study, represent a safe and efficient alternative to the traditional clamp-and-tie hand technique in the thyroidal surgery scenario, granting a reduction in operating time while not increasing RNL injury rates. According to this information, a preference for energy based devices techniques might be expressed, furthermore, a progressively higher usage rate for these devices is expected in the near future.","Pacilli, Mario; Tartaglia, Nicola; Gerundo, Alberto; Pavone, Giovanna; Fersini, Alberto; Ambrosi, Antonio",Medicina,103,7

OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety at 5 years and beyond. SETTING Tertiary referral hospital between April 2007 and March 2015. METHODS A retrospective review of 76 patients who underwent LSG at the senior author's institution between April 2007 and March 2010. RESULTS Mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 42.8±7.1 kg/m2. Follow-up rates were 90.4%, 86.3%, and 77.8% at 5, 6, and 7 years, respectively. Percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was 69.8%±28.7% at 5 years, 70.6%±32.7% at 6 years, and 76.6%±21.2% at 7 years, respectively. Mean total weight loss was 26.5%±8.7%, 24.9%±8.8%, and 26.6%±6.0% at 5, 6, and 7 years, respectively. %EWL at 5-years was significantly higher for patients with a preoperative BMI<45 kg/m2 (83.1% versus 46.3%, P<.0001). LSG improved or resolved diabetes, hypertension, and asthma in 87.5%, 68%, and 81.7% of patients, respectively. New onset gastroesophageal acid reflux disease developed in 21.2% of patients. Long-term complications included hiatal hernias necessitating repair (1.4%), incisional hernias (2.7%), and symptomatic gallstones (9.6%), as well as depression necessitating admission (4.1%). CONCLUSION In the present patient population, LSG resulted in satisfactory %EWL and co-morbidity resolution after 5 years. The results were excellent for patients with a BMI<45 kg/m2. De novo acid reflux symptoms developed in 1 of 5 patients. Cholelithiasis necessitating cholecystectomy was the most common long-term complication.","Dakour Aridi, Hanaa; Alami, Ramzi; Tamim, Hani; Shamseddine, Ghassan; Fouani, Tarek; Safadi, Bassem",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,103,1

A consensus statement on the preferred clinical pathway in the perioperative treatment of patients undergoing septorhinoplasty has yet to be approached formally. OBJECTIVES To investigate the perioperative treatment of patients undergoing septorhinoplasty and to identify common practice patterns based on the preferences of leading facial plastic surgeons. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We distributed an online survey to members of the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. Specifically, fellowship directors and academic contact members were anonymously polled and stratified by the number of septorhinoplasties performed annually. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE A cohesive clinical guide to perioperative treatment after rhinoplasty. RESULTS Of the 92 members surveyed, 67 (73%) successfully completed the survey. The distribution of respondents included 43 academicians (64%) and 24 physicians in private practice (36%). Twenty-eight surgeons (42%) performed fewer than 50 rhinoplasties a year and 39 (58%), more than 50, representing 3510 to 4549 septorhinoplasties in total among respondents. Forty-four surgeons (66%) refrained from using any packing, and 41 (61%) used intranasal splints, with polymeric silicone splints the most popular of these (n = 24 [59%]). Sixty-six surgeons (99%) used external nasal splints, including 49 (74%) who used a thermoplastic splint and 49 (74%) who left the external nasal splint in place for 7 days or longer. The most common postoperative interventions to reduce edema and ecchymosis were elevation of the head of bed by 62 (93%), ice packs by 50 (75%), and Arnica montana by 33 (49%). Only 12 surgeons (18%) used postoperative corticosteroids to reduce edema. Fifty-six respondents (84%) prohibited participation in contact sports until at least 6 weeks after surgery. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Perioperative care and practices after nasal surgery vary among the most highly trained and leading rhinoplasty surgeons. No published communication or consensus on perioperative practices has been disseminated in this setting. Given the results from those surgeons performing the most rhinoplasties in our field, some surgeons may choose to vary their practices to coincide with those of experienced surgeons. These guidelines could facilitate future studies of patient outcomes.","Shadfar, Scott; Deal, Allison M; Jarchow, Andrea M; Yang, Hojin; Shockley, William W",JAMA facial plastic surgery,103,12

Our study tested the hypothesis that a novel, nonselective inhaled PDGF receptor inhibitor, PK10453, would decrease pulmonary hypertension both in the rat monocrotaline (MCT) model and the rat MCT plus pneumonectomy (MCT+PN) model of PAH. PK10453, delivered by inhalation for 4 (D4)- and 8 (D8)-minute exposures 3 times a day for 2 weeks, decreased right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) in both the rat MCT and rat MCT+PN models: RVSP was 80.4 ± 2.6 mmHg in the vehicle MCT group (n = 6), 44.4 ± 5.8 mmHg in the D4 MCT group (n = 6), and 37.1 ± 4.5 mmHg in the D8 MCT group (n = 5; P < 0.001 vs. vehicle); RVSP was 75.7 ± 7.1 mmHg in the vehicle MCT+PN group (n = 9), 40.4 ± 2.7 mmHg in the D4 MCT+PN group (n = 10), and 43.0 ± 3.0 mmHg in the D8 MCT+PN group (n = 8; P < 0.001). In the rat MCT+PN model, continuous telemetry monitoring of pulmonary artery pressures also demonstrated that PK10453 prevented the progression of PAH. Imatinib given by inhalation was equally effective in the MCT model but was not effective in the MCT+PN model. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased activation of the PDGFβ receptor compared to the PDGFα receptor in neointimal and perivascular lesions found in the MCT+PN model. We show that imatinib is selective for the PDGFα receptor, whereas PK10453 has a lower half-maximal inhibitor concentration (IC50) for inhibition of kinase activity of both the PDGFα and PDGFβ receptors compared to imatinib. In conclusion, PK10453, when delivered by inhalation, significantly decreased the progression of PAH in the rat MCT and MCT+PN models. Nonselective inhibition of both the PDGFα and PDGFβ receptors may have a therapeutic advantage over selective PDGFα receptor inhibition in PAH.","Medarametla, Venkatrao; Festin, Stephen; Sugarragchaa, Chuluunbaatar; Eng, Alexander; Naqwi, Amir; Wiedmann, Timothy; Zisman, Lawrence S",Pulmonary circulation,103,1

A Case Report.,14.717904,9.696708,2021-09-01,"Background Psychological factors are associated with an increased risk of developing ischemic heart disease ( IHD ). Women more often report psychological factors, and sex and gender differences are present in IHD . In this meta-analysis we examine the risks of psychological factors for IHD incidence in women and men. We hypothesize that a broad range of psychological factors are related to a higher risk for incident IHD , with a higher risk for women. Methods and Results PubMed, EMBASE , and Psyc INFO were searched for studies assessing the risk between psychological factors and incident IHD . Psychological factors included depression, anxiety or panic disorder, social support, hostility, anger, personality (type D), type A behavior pattern, posttraumatic stress disorder, and psychological distress. In the primary analyses, 62 studies (77 separate reports) that included 2 145 679 women and 3 119 879 men and reported confounder-adjusted hazard ratios or relative risks were included. Pooled effect confounder-adjusted estimates from random-effects models showed that psychological factors (all combined) were associated with incident IHD in women (hazard ratio: 1.22; 95% CI , 1.14-1.30) and men (hazard ratio: 1.25; 95% CI , 1.19-1.31). No sex and gender differences were found for these pooled effect estimates ( P=0.547). Conclusions Psychological factors are associated with incident IHD in both women and men, but no significant differences were observed between women and men. IHD is predominantly being studied as obstructive coronary artery disease, which is more prevalent in men. Data are needed on psychological predictors and other manifestations of IHD such as coronary microvascular disease, which is more common in women.","Smaardijk, Veerle R; Lodder, Paul; Kop, Willem J; van Gennep, Bente; Maas, Angela H E M; Mommersteeg, Paula M C",Journal of the American Heart Association,103,1

We aimed to understand transition to telehealth, stress, and if self-care and emotion regulation were related to stress level. Participants (N = 207) were mental health providers in independent practice. Participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen et al., 1983);Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (Gross & John, 2003);and Self-Care Assessment for Psychologists (Dorociak, Rupert, Bryant, et al., 2017) in alternating order, and answered questions about personal and professional demographics, type of independent practice, and stressors and supports during COVID-19 (closed-ended and open-ended questions). Results indicated that participants rarely used telehealth prior to COVID 19 (with 46.80% stating they never used it and 42.36% stating they used it less than a quarter of their time) and had a rapid shift to telehealth provision (with 72.91% exclusively using telehealth shortly before or after the declaration of the pandemic). Most participants reported only moderate stress during the early months of COVID-19. For emotion regulation, increased use of cognitive reappraisal was associated with less stress, but increased use of expressive suppression was associated with increased stress. All facets of self-care were associated with less stress-having professional support, engaging in professional development, having life balance, utilizing cognitive strategies, and aiming for daily balance. Participants indicated a wide variety of stressors, some related to practice and some to the pandemic, as well as sources of support, including colleagues and professional organizations.

Kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (KNDy neurons) are considered the main regulator of GnRH output. GnRH and KNDy neurons are surrounded by astrocytes, which can modulate neuronal activity and communicate over distances. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), synthesized primarily by astrocytes, increases GnRH neuron activity and downstream pituitary release of luteinizing hormone (LH). We hypothesized GFAP-expressing astrocytes play a role regulating GnRH and/or KNDy neuron activity and LH release. We used adenoassociated viruses to target designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) to GFAP-expressing cells to activate Gq or Gi-mediated signaling. Activating Gq signaling in the preoptic area, near GnRH neurons, but not in the arcuate, increases LH release in vivo and GnRH firing in vitro via a mechanism in part dependent upon PGE2. These data suggest astrocytes can activate GnRH/LH release in a manner independent of KNDy neurons.","Vanacker, Charlotte; DeFazio, R. Anthony; Sykes, Charlene M.; Moenter, Suzanne M.",bioRxiv,103,26

Methods Individuals with AF and a CHA2DS2-VASc score>=2 on January 1st 2020 were identified using pseudonymised, linked electronic health records for 56 million people in England and followed-up until May 1st 2021. Factors associated with pre-existing AT use were analysed using logistic regression. Differences in COVID-19 related hospitalisation and death were analysed using logistic and Cox regression for individuals exposed to pre-existing AT use vs no AT use, anticoagulants (AC) vs antiplatelets (AP) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) vs warfarin. Results From 972,971 individuals with AF and a CHA2DS2-VASc score>=2, 88.0% (n=856,336) had pre-existing AT use, 3.8% (n=37,418) had a COVID-19 related hospitalisation and 2.2% (n=21,116) died. Factors associated with no AT use included comorbidities that may contraindicate AT use (liver disease and history of falls) and demographics (socioeconomic status and ethnicity). Pre-existing AT use was associated with lower odds of death (OR=0.92 [0.87-0.96 at 95% CI]), but higher odds of hospitalisation OR=1.20 [1.15-1.26 at 95% CI]). The same pattern was observed for AC vs AP (death (OR=0.93 [0.87-0.98]), hospitalisation (OR=1.17 [1.11-1.24])) but not for DOACs vs warfarin (death (OR=1.00 [0.95-1.05]), hospitalisation (OR=0.86 [0.82-0.89]). Conclusions Pre-existing AT use may offer marginal protection against COVID-19 death, with AC offering more protection than AP. Although this association may not be causal, it provides further incentive to improve AT coverage for eligible individuals with AF.","Handy, A.; Banerjee, A.; Wood, A.; Dale, C.; Sudlow, C.; Tomlinson, C.; Bean, D.; Thygesen, J.

We evaluated the use of the Tasso OnDemand™, a device that facilitates relatively painless self-collection of enough blood for HIV, creatinine, and quantitative rapid plasma reagin testing.From May 2020 – January 2021, we recruited subjects for two studies of the Tasso device and HBPM preferences. First, we sent invitations to English-speaking clients enrolled in an online messaging platform and receiving PrEP through the Sexual Health Clinic (SHC) in Seattle, WA, asking them to view a Tasso device video and complete a survey. In a second study, we recruited SHC PrEP clients and persons with known/suspected syphilis or living with HIV. After brief instruction in clinic, clients used the Tasso device and completed a survey about their experience.Of 509 clients offered participation online and 46 in clinic, 102 (20%) and 46 (100%), respectively, completed surveys. Most participants were cisgender men (132, 90%) of median age 34 years who identified as non-Hispanic White (78, 52.7%). Thirty-seven (45%) reported a history of syphilis. Given current COVID restrictions, 124 (89.2%) participants were interested in self-collecting PrEP laboratory samples at home. Many felt home sampling kits would increase their likelihood of staying on PrEP (61/135, 45.2%). Of the 46 participants who self-collected blood specimens in clinic, 42 (93.3%) felt the process was easy and 35/36 (97.2%) PrEP-eligible participants felt they could similarly self-collect blood at home.Self-collection of blood specimens using the Tasso device is feasible and acceptable to persons using PrEP. Future studies will assess how often individuals will use this device rather than come to the SHC for PrEP care and the impact of HBPM on PrEP retention.","Cannon, C.; Malinski, C.; Golden, M.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,103,33

The aim of this study was to create a novel multidimensional mobility index to capture the complexity of human interaction and evaluate its utility as an early indicator of surges in COVID-19 cases. Methods: We used publicly available anonymous cell phone data compiled by SafeGraph, from all counties in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana between January 1st to December 8, 2020. Six metrics of mobility were extracted for each county. Changes in mobility were defined as a time-updated 7-day rolling average. We used an unsupervised machine learning method known as functional principal component analysis (fPCA) to construct the latent mobility index (MI) using the six metrics of mobility. Associations between our MI and COVID-19 cases were estimated using a quasi-Poisson hierarchical generalized additive model adjusted for population density and the COVID-19 community vulnerability index. Results: Individual mobility metrics varied significantly by counties and by calendar time. More than 50% of the variability in the data was explained by the first principal component by each state, indicating good dimension reduction. Following the expiration of stay-at-home orders, mobility increased across all counties and this was particularly evident on weekends. While an individual metric of mobility was not associated with surges of COVID-19, our MI was independently associated with COVID-19 cases in all four states given varying time-lags. Conclusion: Following the expiration of stay-at-home orders, a single metric of mobility was not sensitive enough to capture the complexity of human interactions. Monitoring mobility can be an important public health tool, however, it should be modelled as a multidimensional construct.","Her, P. H.; Saeed, S.; Tram, K. H.; Bhatnagar, S. R.",,103,24

Many learning providers were obliged to move to fully online learning from March 2020 with some adopting hybrid approaches in line with government and health advice. Many university programmes were rapidly redesigned to be delivered online but this is not just a matter of providing resources in digital format. While there is no agreed definition of higher order thinking (HOT) it is generally understood that HOT elevates thinking to levels beyond restating the facts. HOT involves understanding of the knowledge, inference from them, connections to other facts and concepts, categorisation, manipulation of the knowledge and finally, reconstructing them into new or novel ways to provide solutions to unique problems. We discuss the challenges of achieving HOT within the online environment but also the import of providing opportunities for students to engage fully with the entire range of learning levels. In this paper we consider HOT within the context of a pyramid learning structure with lower order thinking at the base and higher order thinking dominating the apex;building from remembering to understanding, applying, analysing, evaluating to creating. We provide a review of our experiences of experimentation with a range of different learning activities such as discussions, quizzes and assignments delivered on a VLE (Canvas) for an undergraduate cohort studying Computing and Information Technology related course of degree study. We review the impact of different curriculum items and educational activities to promote HOT on student experience and the achievement of learning outcomes.We reflect on how students learn via online content delivery and we propose how the learning experience can be enhanced to promote higher categories of cognitive thinking. We demonstrate how a pyramid model of curriculum activities facilitates the learner scaling from knowledge to the more challenging skills of creation and how this effective learning environment facilitates higher order thinking practice. We propose practical examples of the application of a pyramid learning structure within e-learning environments to deepen student learning, student access and engagement with leading to successful students' workplace experience in the future. © 2021 IEEE.","Pishchukhina, O.; Watson, E.

While the state of COVID-19 research reveals it is currently in an early stage of developing knowledge, a comprehensive and in-depth overview is still missing. Accordingly, the paper’s main aim is to provide an extensive bibliometric analysis of COVID-19 research across the science and social science research landscape, using innovative bibliometric approaches (e.g., Venn diagram, Biblioshiny descriptive statistics, VOSviewer co-occurrence network analysis, Jaccard distance cluster analysis, text mining based on binary logistic regression). The bibliometric analysis considers the Scopus database, including all relevant information on COVID-19 related publications (n = 16,866) available in the first half of 2020. The empirical results indicate the domination of health sciences in terms of number of relevant publications and total citations, while physical sciences and social sciences and humanities lag behind significantly. Nevertheless, there is an evidence of COVID-19 research collaboration within and between different subject area classifications with a gradual increase in importance of non-health scientific disciplines. The findings emphasize the great need for a comprehensive and in-depth approach that considers various scientific disciplines in COVID-19 research so as to benefit not only the scientific community but evidence-based policymaking as part of efforts to properly respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ravšelj, Dejan Umek Lan",Sustainability,103,1

The results of the analyses showed that:1) the pandemic control measures and the re-allocation of market resources are the short-term factors unbalancing the supply and demand for automotive chips. 2) the global shortage of Chips of the automotive industry may continue and the risk of breaking the industrial chain is increasing. Because it is a long industry chain which relies on efficient cross-border collaboration, but it is lack of international prevention and control cooperation mechanism altogether.

Despite this belief, whether HE produces certificates/qualifications or job-ready graduates—this debate remains unsettled. To date, the current COVID-19 pandemic which erupted in late 2019 continues to create much economic, social and political dislocation throughout the world. Consequently, one outcome for HE during this crisis is the much greater dependence on online/digital technology to deliver courses and programs. Although it is not considered to be a complete substitute, critics argue that education delivered through online technology has expended the ‘diploma disease’ crisis and subsequently may pose a threat to the viability of producing HE graduates. It has been suggested that this can result in significant long-term problems that may be impossible to recover from. This study was based on a ‘empirical survey’ where the sample incorporated 240 people in two groups (before and during COVID-19, for a total of 120 in each), and the objective was to examine academic and job-readiness of graduates in greater depth. Findings demonstrate that pre-pandemic students scored poorly academically compared to their post-pandemic classmates. Pre-pandemic graduates, on the other hand, had higher work readiness scores in terms of both aptitude and practical aspects. Furthermore, both groups outperformed their job-readiness scores in terms of learning performance. This raises the question: is it the job of higher education to promote sustainable production of graduates or deliver certificates and degrees? COVID-19 appears to have been utilised by the HE system as an excuse to exacerbate the “diploma disease crisis,” a scenario that must be resolved by developing a proper policy framework that allows HE to play the necessary role in an emergency. Meaningful measures should be taken so that online technology is employed properly in this situation.","Alam, Gazi Mahabubul",Technology in Society,103,28
185661,185661,185661,Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis: an update.,14.830262,9.298157,2005,"Background: Digital medicine describes a field concerned with the use of technologies as tools for measurement, and intervention in the service of human health. Digital medicine products are driven by high-quality hardware and software that support the practice of medicine broadly, including treatment, recovery, disease prevention, and health promotion for individuals and across populations. Digital medicine products can be used independently or in concert with pharmaceuticals, biologics, devices, or other products to optimize patient care and health outcomes. Digital medicine empowers patients and healthcare providers with intelligent and accessible tools to address a wide range of conditions through high-quality, safe, and effective measurements and data-driven interventions. As a discipline, digital medicine encapsulates both broad professional expertise and responsibilities concerning the use of these digital tools. Digital medicine focuses on evidence-generation to support the use of these technologies. In the digital era of medicine, a number of processes, best practices, and ethical norms have started to shift as we learn how to develop trustworthy technologies. Methods: Medic Assistant is the digital cloud solution supporting healthcare personnel in its everyday work with patients. The core of the system is an intuitive and responsive online application that helps to manage patients, their examinations, and images taken during the examination. It provides users with multilevel communication channels based on eg. doctor doctor, doctor patient relationships. Results: Collected data are cleared from sensitive information in terms of GDPR regulations and stored in cloud databases. The internationalization of Medic Assistant is so far made by two enabled languages: English and Polish. However, the system was designed to allow adding new translations easily and without any technical skills. The structure of stored data and access to them are designed to be easily utilized by any Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning system. The main results of Medic Assistant is to create an ecosystem where data are collected by healthcare personnel society. The ability to use them in order to create new IT solutions is open to any innovators. Conclusions: Digital solutions and medical innovations supporting the fight against the coronavirus, in the reality of overburdened health care, have become widely used almost overnight. Medic Assistant is a application for monitoring skin cancers as well as the effects of undesirable oncological drugs. Medic Assistant improves the two-way communication of the diagnostician-doctor-patient. Medical assistant is a sensible and efficient way to deliver healthcare while implementing social distancing to combat the spread of COVID-19. Legal entity responsible for the study: The author.

Thus, understanding the propagation of fake news and implementing countermeasures has become exceedingly important to the well-being of society. To assist this cause, we produce a valuable dataset called FibVID (Fake news information-broadcasting dataset of COVID-19), which addresses COVID-19 and non-COVID news from three key angles. First, we provide truth and falsehood (T/F) indicators of news items, as labeled and validated by several fact-checking platforms (e.g., Snopes and Politifact). Second, we collect spurious-claim-related tweets and retweets from Twitter, one of the world’s largest social networks. Third, we provide basic user information, including the terms and characteristics of “heavy fake news” user to present a better understanding of T/F claims in consideration of COVID-19. FibVID provides several significant contributions. It helps to uncover propagation patterns of news items and themes related to identifying their authenticity. It further helps catalog and identify the traits of users who engage in fake news diffusion. We also provide suggestions for future applications of FibVID with a few exploratory analyses to examine the effectiveness of the approaches used.","Kim, Jisu Aum Jihwan Lee SangEun Jang Yeonju Park Eunil Choi Daejin",Telematics and Informatics,103,24

Understanding the health consequences of these impacts will be increasingly important in the 'recovery' phase. This article contributes to this understanding by exploring the relationship between unemployment and cardiovascular disease (CVD)-a major contributor to health loss in Aotearoa New Zealand. We reviewed the literature about the impact of unemployment on CVD. The totality of the evidence suggested that increased unemployment arising from economic shocks is associated with increased CVD incidence, particularly for middle-aged men. Continued monitoring and active policy responses are required to prevent increases in CVD (and other health outcomes) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic response. For example, quantifying the CVD-related health loss from pandemic-associated unemployment, along with the health costs and impact on health inequalities, could help with government decision-making to reduce CVD burdens. This could be via intensifying tobacco control, regulating the food supply (eg, to reduce salt/sodium levels), and improving uptake of CVD preventive medications such as statins and anti-hypertensives.","Nghiem, Nhung; Mizdrak, Anja; Wilson, Nick",The New Zealand medical journal,103,1

We previously revealed that UV-inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virions (UV-V) elicited high levels of humoral immunity and a weak Th0 response in mice immunized subcutaneously. To ensure the safety of such a whole inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine, we additionally treated the UV-V vaccine with formalin, resulting in the UV-F-V vaccine. Analysis of the immunogenicity of the UV-F-V+alum vaccine in mice revealed that it generated comparable neutralizing serum anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibody levels as the UV-V+alum vaccine. Moreover, both vaccines induced similar frequencies of anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibody-producing cells in bone marrow. Interestingly, the UV-F-V vaccine induced fewer IgG(2a) subtype antibodies and higher interleukin-4 production in vaccinated mice than did UV-V. Thus, UV-F-V imposes a Th2-type bias on the immune response, unlike UV-V. We propose here that doubly-inactivated SARS-CoV virions by UV and formalin constitute a safe vaccine that may effectively induce neutralizing antibodies in humans.","Tsunetsugu-Yokota, Yasuko; Ato, Manabu; Takahashi, Yoshimasa; Hashimoto, Shu-ichi; Kaji, Tomohiro; Kuraoka, Masayuki; Yamamoto, Ki-ichi; Mitsuki, Yu-ya; Yamamoto, Takuya; Oshima, Masamichi; Ohnishi, Kazuo; Takemori, Toshitada",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,103,1

In this article, through an analysis of Australian legislation and international case law, we address these questions, considering the potential impact of CDSSs on doctors' liability in negligence. We conclude that the appropriate use of a well-designed CDSS should minimise, rather than heighten, doctor's potential liability. It should support optimal patient care without diminishing the capacity of the doctor to make individualised decisions about recall, testing and treatment for each patient. We foreshadow that in the future doctors in Australia may have a duty to use available well-established software systems in patient care.","Prictor, Megan; Taylor, Mark; Kaye, Jane; Emery, Jon; Nelson, Craig; Manski-Nankervis, Jo-Anne",Journal of law and medicine,103,28

To determine whether the 3'-end sequence is also involved in subgenomic mRNA transcription, we have constructed MHV defective interfering (DI) RNAs which contain a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene placed behind an intergenic sequence and a 3'-end sequence with various degrees of internal deletions. The DI RNAs were transfected into MHV-infected cells, and CAT activities, which represent subgenomic mRNA transcription from the intergenic site, were determined. The results demonstrated that the deletions of sequence upstream of the 350 nt at the 3'-end, which include the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), of MHV genomic RNA did not affect subgenomic mRNA transcription. However, deletions that reduced the 3'-end sequences to 270 nt or less completely abolished the mRNA transcription despite the fact that all of these clones synthesized minus-strand RNAs. These results indicated that mRNA transcription from an intergenic site in the MHV DI RNA requires most of the 3'-UTR as a cis-acting signal, which likely exerts its effects during plus-strand RNA synthesis. A substitution of the corresponding bovine coronavirus sequence for the MHV sequence within nt 270 to 305 from the 3'-end abrogated the CAT gene expression, suggesting a very rigid sequence requirement in this region. The deletion of a putative pseudoknot structure within the 3'-UTR also abolished the CAT gene expression. These findings suggest that the 3'-UTR may interact with the other RNA regulatory elements to regulate mRNA transcription.","Lin, Y J; Zhang, X; Wu, R C; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,103,29

In this study, 829 serum specimens were collected from 643 patients initially reported to be infected with SARS-CoV. The sera were tested for the N protein of SARS-CoV by using an antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on monoclonal antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV and compared to 197 control serum samples from healthy donors and non-SARS febrile patients. The results of the N protein detection analysis were directly related to the serological analysis data. From 27 SARS patients who tested positive with the neutralization test, 100% of the 24 sera collected from 1 to 10 days after the onset of symptoms were positive for the N protein. N protein was not detected beyond day 11 in this group. The positive rates of N protein for sera collected at 1 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, and 16 to 20 days after the onset of symptoms for 414 samples from 298 serologically confirmed patients were 92.9, 69.8, 36.4, and 21.1%, respectively. For 294 sera from 248 serological test-negative patients, the rates were 25.6, 16.7, 9.3, and 0%, respectively. The N protein was not detected in 66 patients with cases of what was initially suspected to be SARS but serologically proven to be negative for SARS and in 197 serum samples from healthy donors and non-SARS febrile patients. The specificity of the assay was 100%. Furthermore, of 16 sera collected from four patients during the SARS recurrence in Guangzhou, 5 sera collected from 7 to 9 days after the onset of symptoms were positive for the N protein. N protein detection exhibited a high positive rate, 96 to 100%, between day 3 and day 5 after the onset of symptoms for 27 neutralization test-positive SARS patients and 298 serologically confirmed patients. The N protein detection rate continually decreased beginning with day 10, and N protein was not detected beyond day 19 after the onset of symptoms.

A novel coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of SARS. This report summarizes the hematological findings in SARS patients and proposes a hypothesis for the pathophysiology of SARS coronavirus related abnormal hematopoiesis. Hematological changes in patients with SARS were common and included lymphopenia (68% - 90% of adults; 100% of children, n = 10), thrombocytopenia (20% - 45% of adults, 50% of children), and leukopenia (20% - 34% of adults, 70% of children). The possible mechanisms of this coronavirus on blood system may include (1) directly infect blood cells and bone marrow stromal cells via CD13 or CD66a; and/or (2) induce auto-antibodies and immune complexes to damage these cells. In addition, lung damage in SARS patients may also play a role on inducing thrombocytopenia by (1) increasing the consumption of platelets/megakaryocytes; and/or (2) reducing the production of platelets in the lungs.

With the emergence of more efficient immune therapies, severe sometimes even fatal central nervous system infections were observed. This review will address the role of the systemic immune system in central nervous system immune surveillance and discuss implications for the development of novel immunotherapies in multiple sclerosis. RECENT FINDINGS In the last decade, a number of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents have been approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, based on the results of double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease has prompted exploration of the therapeutic utility of new drugs that more potently disrupt the pathophysiological cascade of events that culminates in central nervous system tissue damage. One potential side-effect of these newer therapies is their interference with the control of central nervous system infections by the immune system. SUMMARY Any increase in potency of multiple sclerosis therapies could well interfere with protective immunosurveillance of the central nervous system. One possible outcome is an increased incidence of opportunistic infections. A heightened vigilance for central nervous system infections in the setting of immunosuppression is necessary to prevent serious side-effects in the future.","Hemmer, Bernhard; Frohman, Eiliot; Hartung, Hans Peter; Stüve, Olaf",Current opinion in neurology,103,1

METHODS We tested a nonmyeloablative regimen of mAb S5 and 200 cGy TBI with postgrafting MMF/CSP in 44 DLA-haploidentical recipients using eight different regimens. Ten dogs also received escalating doses of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) alone or with pentostatin to convert to complete donor chimerism. RESULTS All dogs achieved initial engraftment between one to two weeks after HCT with peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) donor chimerism ranging from 2% to 98% (median 37%) on day +35. Twenty-five (57%) dogs rejected their donor grafts at a median of seven (range; 1-19) weeks after HCT. Low levels of PBMC donor chimerism at three weeks predicted graft rejection. DLI neither facilitated conversion to full donor chimerism after HCT nor prevented rejection. Higher total nucleated cells, CD4+, CD8+, and CD14+ cell subset numbers in the PBMC graft were associated with stable full donor engraftment. Dogs given higher cell subset doses of infused PBMC achieved longer duration of mixed chimerism. CONCLUSIONS Nonmyeloablative conditioning with 200 cGy TBI and anti-CD44 mAb was sufficient for initial uniform engraftment across DLA haplotype-mismatched barriers. However, sustained donor engraftment was seen in only 43% of recipients. Graft composition and donor-dominant chimerism early after HCT may be the most important factors for sustained donor engraftment.","Fukuda, Takahiro; Kerbauy, Fabio R; Gooley, Theodore; Santos, Erlinda B; Storb, Rainer; Sandmaier, Brenda M",Transplantation,103,9

In mammalian cells, the kinetochore is a highly differentiated trilaminar structure situated at the surface of the centromeric heterochromatin. CENP-C is a basic, DNA-binding protein that localizes to the inner kinetochore plate, the region that abuts the heterochromatin. Microinjection experiments using antibodies specific for CENP-C have demonstrated that this protein is required for the assembly and/or stability of the kinetochore as well as for a timely transition through mitosis. From these observations, it has been suggested that CENP-C is a structural protein that is involved in the organization or the kinetochore. In this report, we wished to identify and map the functional domains of CENP-C. Analysis of CENP-C truncation mutants expressed in vivo demonstrated that CENP-C possesses an autonomous centromere-targeting domain situated at the central region of the CENP-C polypeptide. Similarly, in vitro assays revealed that a region of CENP-C with the ability to bind DNA is also located at the center of the CENP-C molecule, where it overlaps the centromere-targeting domain.","Yang, C H; Tomkiel, J; Saitoh, H; Johnson, D H; Earnshaw, W C",Molecular and cellular biology,103,17

The present study provides a strategy to rapidly identify SARS-CoV-derived antigenic peptides recognized by HLA-A2-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Forty-three candidate peptides having HLA-A2-binding motifs were selected in silico and HLA-A2/Db chimeric MHC class I-transgenic mice were immunized with these peptides and a new derivative of muramyl dipeptide that can induce upregulation of HLA-DR, CD80, CD86, and CD40 in human CD14+ antigen presenting cells, was administered as an adjuvant. Six HLAA2-restricted mouse CTL epitopes were identified, including two new epitopes which have never been reported before. One of the novel peptides was naturally processed and successfully induced HLAA2-restricted specific CTLs in both HLA transgenic mice and healthy donors. The method was useful, convenient and efficient for rapid identification of CTL epitopes derived from SARS-CoV proteins and will be possibly applicable for other pathogens to develop a peptide-based vaccine.","Chen, Y-Z; Liu, G; Senju, S; Wang, Q; Irie, A; Haruta, M; Matsui, M; Yasui, F; Kohara, M; Nishimura, Y",International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology,103,12

This mutant exhibits hyperactive behavior and paralysis following a mechanical ""bang"" or electrical shock. Electrophysiological analyses have shown that this mutant is much more prone to seizure episodes than normal flies because it has a drastically lowered seizure threshold. Through genetic mapping, molecular cloning, and RNA interference, we have demonstrated that the sda phenotype can be attributed to a mutation in the Drosophila homolog of the human aminopeptidase N (APN) gene. Furthermore, using mRNA in situ hybridization and LacZ staining, we have found that the sda gene is expressed specifically in the central nervous system at particular developmental stages. Together, these results suggest that the bang sensitivity in sda mutants is caused by a defective APN gene that somehow increases seizure susceptibility. Finally, by using the sda mutation as a sensitized background, we have been able to identify a rich variety of sda enhancers and other independent BS mutations.","Zhang, HaiGuang; Tan, Jeff; Reynolds, Elaine; Kuebler, Daniel; Faulhaber, Sally; Tanouye, Mark",Genetics,103,17

To date, over forty million people have officially been identified to be infected with this virus with less than 3% death rate. Since many more people are expected to have been infected with this virus without the official diagnosis, the number of people who have recovered from the SARS-CoV-2 infection should be substantial. Given the large number of people recovered from either the mild SARS-CoV-2 infection or more severe COVID-19 conditions, it is critical to understand the long-term consequences of the infection by this virus. Our histological evaluations revealed that patients died of COVID-19 exhibited thickened pulmonary vascular walls, one important hallmark of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). By contrast, such pulmonary vascular remodeling lesions were not found in patients died of SARS-CoV-1 during the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak or due to the infection by H1N1 influenza. The advancement in the treatment for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been remarkable that HIV-infected individuals now live for a long time, in turn revealing that these individuals become susceptible to developing PAH, a fatal condition. We herein hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 is another virus that is capable to triggering the increased susceptibility of infected individuals to developing PAH in the future. Given the large number of people being infected with SARS-CoV-2 during this pandemic and that most people recover from severe, mild or asymptomatic conditions, it is imperative to generate scientific information on how the health of recovered individuals may be affected long-term. PAH is one lethal consequence that should be considered and needs to be monitored.

Data reporting a viral intra-host and inter-host evolution favouring the appearance of mild SARS-CoV-2 strains are since being accumulating. To better understand the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and its adaptation to the host, it is therefore crucial to investigate the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating lately in the epidemic. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs have been analyzed for viral load in the early (March 2020) and late (May 2020) phases of epidemic in Brescia, Italy. Isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from 2 high viral load specimens identified on March 9 (AP66) and on May 8 (GZ69) was performed on Vero E6 cells. Amount of virus released was assessed by quantitative PCR. Genotypic characterization of AP66 and GZ69 was performed by next generation sequencing followed by an in-depth in silico analysis of nucleotide mutations. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 strain, isolated in May from an asymptomatic healthcare worker, showed an unprecedented capability of replication in Vero E6 cells in the absence of any evident cytopathic effect. Vero E6 subculturing, up to passage 4, showed that SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 infection was as productive as the one sustained by the cytopathic strain AP66. Whole genome sequencing of the persistently replicating SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 has shown that this strain differs from the early AP66 variant in 9 nucleotide positions (C2939T; C3828T; G21784T; T21846C; T24631C; G28881A; G28882A; G28883C; G29810T) which lead to 6 non-synonymous substitutions spanning on ORF1ab (P892S; S1188L), S (K74N; I95T) and N (R203K, G204R) proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of the peculiar SARS-CoV-2 GZ69 strain in the late Italian epidemic highlights the need to better characterize viral variants circulating among asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic individuals. The current approach could unravel the ways for future studies aimed at analyzing the selection process which favours viral mutations in the human host.","Caccuri, Francesca; Zani, Alberto; Messali, Serena; Giovanetti, Marta; Bugatti, Antonella; Campisi, Giovanni; Filippini, Federica; Scaltriti, Erika; Ciccozzi, Massimo; Fiorentini, Simona; Caruso, Arnaldo",J Transl Med,103,24

While multiple tools are available to aid oxygenation, data supporting immune biomarkers for monitoring the host-pathogen interaction across disease stages and for titrating immunomodulatory therapy is lacking. METHODS: In this single-center cohort study, we used an immunoassay platform that enables rapid and quantitative measurement of interferon Î³-induced protein 10 (IP-10), a host protein involved in lung injury from virus-induced hyperinflammation. A dynamic clinical decision support protocol was followed to manage patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and examine the potential utility of timely and serial measurements of IP-10 as tool in regulating inflammation. RESULTS: Overall, 502 IP-10 measurements were performed on 52 patients between 7 April and 10 May 2020, with 12 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. IP-10 levels correlated with COVID-19 severity scores and admission to the intensive care unit. Among patients in the intensive care unit, the number of days with IP-10 levels exceeding 1,000 pg/mL was associated with mortality. Administration of corticosteroid immunomodulatory therapy decreased IP-10 levels significantly.

The occurrence of ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a serious cardiac manifestation of COVID-19; the intrinsic mechanism of coronary thrombosis appears to still be unknown. Objective: To determine the role of NETs in coronary thrombosis in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a consecutive series of patients with COVID-19 at an academic tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain, who underwent primary coronary interventions for STEMI in which coronary aspirates were obtained in the catheterization laboratory using a thrombus aspiration device. Patients with COVID-19 who experienced a STEMI between March 23 and April 11, 2020, from whom coronary thrombus samples were aspirated during primary coronary intervention, were included in the analysis. These patients were compared with a series conducted from July 2015 to December 2015 of patients with STEMI. Main Outcomes and Measures: The presence and quantity of NETs in coronary aspirates from patients with STEMI and COVID-19. The method for the analysis of NETs in paraffin-embedded coronary thrombi was based on the use of confocal microscopy technology and image analysis for the colocalization of myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes and citrullinated histone H3. Immunohistochemical analysis of thrombi was also performed. Clinical and angiographic variables were prospectively collected. Results: Five patients with COVID-19 were included (4 men [80%]; mean [SD] age, 62 [14] years); the comparison group included 50 patients (44 males [88%]; mean [SD] age, 58 [12] years). NETs were detected in the samples of all 5 patients with COVID-19, and the median density of NETs was 61% (95% CI, 43%-91%). In the historical series of patients with STEMI, NETs were found in 34 of 50 thrombi (68%), and the median NET density was 19% (95% CI, 13%-22%; P < .001). All thrombi from patients with COVID-19 were composed of fibrin and polymorphonuclear cells. None of them showed fragments of atherosclerotic plaque or iron deposits indicative of previous episodes of plaque rupture. Conclusions and Relevance: In this small case series of patients with COVID-19 and myocardial infarction, NETs seem to play a major role in the pathogenesis of STEMI in COVID-19 disease. Our findings support the idea that targeting intravascular NETs might be a relevant goal of treatment and a feasible way to prevent coronary thrombosis in patients with severe COVID-19 disease.","Blasco, Ana; Coronado, María-José; Hernández-Terciado, Fernando; Martín, Paloma; Royuela, Ana; Ramil, Elvira; García, Diego; Goicolea, Javier; Del Trigo, María; Ortega, Javier; Escudier, Juan M; Silva, Lorenzo; Bellas, Carmen",JAMA cardiol.

For the first time at great scale, Chinese college students had their educational activities moved online in spring 2020. Due to this unexpected isolation and unconventional learning method, their mental health following returning to school is worth investigating. METHODS: Between June 1 and June 15, 2020, a total of 8,921 returning college students' mental health status were assessed using instruments designed for psychiatric disorders, namely the 9-Item Patient Heath Questionnaire (PHQ-9), 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), 6-Item Impact of Event Scale (IES-6), Youth Self Rating Insomnia Scale (YSIS), and self-developed questionnaire. RESULTS: Our results showed that 8.7%, 4.2%, 10.5%, and 6.1% of the participants experienced depression, anxiety, acute stress, and insomnia, respectively, with a total of 19.8% reporting having at least one psychiatric symptom following their return to school. Sophomore and Senior year, and presence of previous psychiatric conditions contribute to the increased occurrence of psychiatric issues. The level of impact by COVID-19 on one's daily functioning is also positively associated with poor mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested no significant increase in the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms, following the first batch of students' return to school. These findings aim to complement the current understanding of the psychiatric impact of COVID-19 on students and assist school principals to plan their return-to-school approaches in a mental-health sensitive way.","Wang, Dongfang; Chen, Huilin; Zhai, Shuyi; Zhu, Zhiyi; Huang, Shuiqing; Zhou, Xiuzhu; Pan, Ye; Meng, Dongjing; Yang, Zheng; Zhao, Jingbo; Fan, Fang; Liu, Xianchen",J Affect Disord,103,24

There is currently a lot of effort being placed in identifying molecules that could act as putative drugs or blockers of viral molecules. In this work, we computationally explore the importance in antiviral activity of a less studied class of molecules, namely surfactants. We employ all-atoms molecular dynamics simulations to study the interaction between the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the phospholipid lecithin (POPC), in water. Our microsecond simulations show a preferential binding of lecithin to the receptor-binding motif of SARS-CoV-2 with binding energies significantly larger than kBT. Furthermore, hydrophobic interactions in- volving lecithin non-polar tails dominate these binding events, which are also accompanied by dewetting of the receptor binding motif. Through an analysis of fluctuations in the radius of gyra- tion of the receptor-binding domains, its contact maps with lecithin molecules, and distributions of water molecules near the binding region, we elucidate molecular interactions that may play an important role in interactions involving surfactant-type molecules and viruses. We discuss our minimal computational model in the context of lecithin-based liposomal nasal sprays as putative mitigating therapies for COVID-19.","Muhammad Nawaz, Qaisrani Jawad Ur Rehman Roman Belousov Elham Moharramzadeh Goliaei Ivan Girotto Ricardo Franklin Oriol Güell Ali Hassanali Edgar Roldan",,103,29

Our aim was to compare the outcome of hospitalized coronavirus disease 219 (COVID-19) patients in low and high SES group. Prospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in three acute hospitals. Electronic case notes were analyzed for baseline characteristics and admission investigations. Scottish index for multiple deprivation (SIMD) was used to divide patients into two groups: more deprived (SIMD 1-5) and less deprived (SIMD 6-10) and results compared. Poor outcome was defined as either need for intubation and/or death. One hundred and seventy-three patients were identified, one was excluded. One hundred and eight (62.8%) were males, mean age was 68.5 ± 14.7 years. Commonest comorbidity was hypertension 87 (50.6%). One hundred and seventeen (68.0%) patients were in more deprived group. Baseline characteristics, admission blood profile and reason for admission were evenly matched in both groups. Outcomes were comparable in both groups: transfer to critical care (27.4% vs 27.3%; P = .991), intubation (18.8% vs 20.2%; P = .853), 30-day all-cause mortality (19.7% vs 14.5%; P = .416) and overall poor outcome (30.8% vs 30.9%; P = .985).

METHODS: This study was designed as a prospective cohort and nested case-control study. A total of 96 eligible patients with COVID-19 in convalescence were enrolled from Beijing Youan Hospital and Beijing Huimin Hospital and followed up from the hospital discharged day. Patients were divided into the CM (64 cases) and the control groups (32 cases) based on the treatment with or without CM and followed up at 14, 28, 56, and 84 days after discharge. In the CM group, patients received the 28-day CM treatment according to two types of CM syndrome. Improvements in clinical symptoms, CM syndrome, and absorption of lung inflammation were observed. RESULTS: All the 96 patients completed the 84-day follow-up from January 21 to March 28, 2020. By the 84th day of follow-up, respiratory symptoms were less than 5%. There was no significant difference in the improvement rates of symptoms, including fatigue, sputum, cough, dry throat, thirst, and upset, between the two groups (P>0.05). Totally 82 patients (85.42%) showed complete lung inflammation absorption at the 84-day follow-up. On day 14, the CM group had a significantly higher absorption rate than the control group (P<0.05) and the relative risk of absorption for CM vs. control group was 3.029 (95% confidence interval: 1.026-8.940). The proportions of CM syndrome types changed with time prolonging: the proportion of the pathogen residue syndrome gradually decreased, and the proportion of both qi and yin deficiency syndrome gradually increased. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 in convalescence had symptoms and lung inflammation after hospital discharge and recovered with time prolonging. CM could improve lung inflammation for early recovery. The types of CM syndrome can be transformed with time prolonging.

The effects of protracted social isolation, and media related misinformation's about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulting in increased fear/stress related to the insufficiently known illness. The aim was to assess the influence of the COVID-19 health crisis on patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). METHODS: A cross-sectional study on 29 adult CIDP patients was performed. The Medical Research Council scale was used to evaluate muscle strength. The degree of functional disability was measured using the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment disability scale. The overall quality of life (QoL) was self-estimated on a 0-100 numeric rating scale. We also used a specifically designed 22-question-survey about COVID-19. RESULTS: Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, 62% of CIDP patients were concerned. The daily activities of 55% of patients were negatively influenced by the pandemic. During the COVID-19 outbreak, 21% of patients reported their CIDP got worse. In 39% of CIDP patients, the influence of the pandemic on CIDP therapy was reported (reducing the dose or time interval or even discontinuation). The mean value of the self-estimated QoL was 64 ± 19. Independent predictors of worse QoL were age of patients (beta = -0.35, p < 0.05) and fear of the COVID-19 (beta = -0.34, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on CIDP patients. Besides the direct influence of the virus and fear of the virus, restrictive measures can indirectly harm the patients with CIDP.","Stojanov, Aleksandar; Bozovic, Ivo; Stojanov, Jelena; Palibrk, Aleksa; Djordjevic, Gordana; Basta, Ivana; Malobabic, Marina; Arsic, Ana Azanjac; Peric, Stojan",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,103,1

Neutral electrolyzed saline solution that contains reactive chlorine and oxygen species may be an effective therapeutic. In the present study, the treatment efficacy of intravenous and/or nebulized neutral electrolyzed saline combined with usual medical care vs. usual medical care alone was evaluated in ambulatory patients with COVID-19. A prospective, 2-arm, parallel-group, randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase I-II clinical trial including 214 patients was performed. The following two outcomes were evaluated during the 20-day follow-up: i) The number of patients with disease progression;and ii) the patient acceptable symptom state. Serial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 naso/oro-pharyngeal detection by reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q) PCR was performed in certain patients of the experimental group. Biochemical and hematologic parameters, as well as adverse effects, were also evaluated in the experimental group. The experimental treatment decreased the risk of hospitalization by 89% [adjusted relative risk (RR)=0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03-0.37, P<0.001] and the risk of death by 96% (adjusted RR=0.04, 95% CI: 0.01-0.42, P=0.007) and also resulted in an 18-fold higher probability of achieving an acceptable symptom state on day 5 (adjusted RR=18.14, 95% CI: 7.29-45.09, P<0.001), compared with usual medical care alone. Overall, neutral electrolyzed saline solution was better than usual medical care alone. Of the patients analyzed, >50% were negative for the virus as detected by RT-qPCR in naso/oro-pharyngeal samples on day 4, with only a small number of positive patients on day 6. Clinical improvement correlated with a decrease in C-reactive protein, aberrant monocytes and increased lymphocytes and platelets. Cortisol and testosterone levels were also evaluated and a decrease in cortisol levels and an increase in the testosterone-cortisol ratio were observed on days 2 and 4. The experimental treatment produced no serious adverse effects. In conclusion, neutral electrolyzed saline solution markedly reduced the symptomatology and risk of progression in ambulatory patients with COVID-19.

This is often accompanied by infrastructure modifications, ward redesignations, as well as healthcare staff redeployments and changes to infection prevention and control (IPC) practices. We review the potential for both negative and positive impacts these major changes can have on nosocomial transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). RECENT FINDINGS: Healthcare facilities around the world have report outbreaks of MDROs during the COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast some centres have reported a decrease in baseline rates due to a number of possible factors. SUMMARY: While implementing crucial preventive measures for COVID-19, is it important to consider any collateral effects of changes in IPC and antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) practices. The disruption caused to IPC and ASP practices during the pandemic are likely to see a counter intuitive increase in transmission of MDROs.","Sun Jin, Louisa; Fisher, Dale",Curr. opin. infect. dis,103,16

News about the number of deaths and cases shared on social media has also increased the anxiety. Anxiety is described as an emotional state in which a feeling of weakness is experienced during preparation for perceived risk;it also includes fear. In our study, the occupational anxiety levels of emergency medicine professionals were compared based on various variables (institution, years of experience, number of daily emergency patient cases in the institution, etc.). Methods: The study was conducted with 168 emergency medical professionals from 5 different countries. The COVID-19 outbreak was ongoing while data was being collected, and the study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee provided that the data were collected online. Research data were obtained in June, July, and August 2020. One of the two sub-factors in the scale is physical, physical, and life anxiety factor. Them are 12 items in this sub-factor: The lowest possible score is 12, and the highest score is 60. The other sub-factors are the work environment, employees, equipment, and environmental factors. Results: Accessibility to personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic caused a difference in bodily, physical, and vital anxiety levels (P &lt; 0.05). Gender, chronic disease before COVID-19 status. marital status. years of experience, overtime work during the COVID-19 pandemic, and SARS-COV-2 contagion status during the treatment process did not cause any difference in bodily. physical, and vital anxiety levels (P &gt; 0.05). The place of work caused a significant difference in the level of bodily. physical and vital anxiety (P &lt; 0.05). Years of experience in the profession caused a significant difference in the level of anxiety regarding work atmosphere, employee, PPE, and environmental factors (P &lt; 0.05). During the COVID-19 pandemic, overtime work during the COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant difference in the level of anxiety related to work atmosphere, employee, equipment, and environmental factors (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergency service working hours caused a significant difference in the anxiety levels related to work atmosphere, employees, equipment. and environmental factors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to personal protective equipment caused a difference in anxiety levels. As a result, the anxiety level of the emergency medicine professionals who are in the front line in the hospitals should be treated, and they should be provided psychological and behavioural support.","Akman, C.; Cetin, M.; Toraman, C.",Signa Vitae,103,16

Teachers' responses are important in the management of the outbreak in schools. The purpose of this study is to examine teachers' risk perception, self-efficacy, response efficacy, and approach to disease prevention during the COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional online survey was completed by 344 teachers across four levels of education. Pearson correlations between major variables were calculated. General linear model with a posthoc test was used to estimate the least squares means for each level of the independent variables and test the mean differences between the response scores. RESULTS: The teachers with a higher risk perception showed a stronger adoption of disease prevention measures, but they also showed lower self-efficacy. In addition, teachers with higher self-efficacy had higher response efficiency. Female teachers had relatively stronger adoption of disease prevention measures than their male colleagues, and age was associated with a 0.040 point increase in adoption scores. Elementary school teachers were significantly stronger in this regard than teachers at junior high schools, high schools and universities in terms of behavior scores. CONCLUSIONS: High implementation rate of Taiwanese teachers' disease prevention measures came from their higher risk perceptions. Among them, older female teachers, especially those who teach at elementary schools, are key to implementing disease prevention measures.","Tang, Jing-Shia; Chen, Chien-Liang; Lin, Chih-Hao; Feng, Jui-Ying",J Infect Public Health,103,26

Due to their advanced age and numerous underlying diseases, the inhabitants of long-term care facilities represent a vulnerable population that should benefit from additional protective measures against contamination. Recently, multiple countries such as France, Spain, Belgium, Canada, and the United States of America reported that an important fraction from the total number of deaths due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection emerged from nursing homes. The scope of this paper was to present the latest data regarding the COVID-19 spread in care homes worldwide, identifying causes and possible solutions that would limit the outbreaks in this overlooked category of population. It is the authors' hope that raising awareness on this matter would encourage more studies to be conducted, considering the fact that there is little information available on the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on nursing homes. Establishing national databases that would register all nursing home residents and their health status would be of great help in the future not only for managing the ongoing pandemic but also for assessing the level of care that is needed in this particularly fragile setting.","Thompson, Dana-Claudia; Barbu, Madalina-Gabriela; Beiu, Cristina; Popa, Liliana Gabriela; Mihai, Mara Madalina; Berteanu, Mihai; Popescu, Marius Nicolae",Biomed Res Int,103,19

Throughout history, pathogens have accompanied human populations and caused various epidemics. One of the most significant outbreaks was the Black Death, which occurred in the 14th century and caused the death of one-third of Europe's population. Pathogens have also been studied for their use as biological warfare agents by the former Soviet Union, Japan, and the USA. Among bacteria and viruses, there are high priority agents that have a significant impact on public health. Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Variola virus, Filoviruses (Ebola, Marburg), Arenoviruses (Lassa), and influenza viruses are included in this group of agents. Outbreaks and infections caused by them might result in social disruption and panic, which is why special operations are needed for public health preparedness. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria that significantly impede treatment and recovery of patients are also valid threats. Furthermore, recent events related to the massive spread of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are an example of how virus-induced diseases cannot be ignored. The impact of outbreaks, such as SARS-CoV-2, have had far-reaching consequences beyond public health. The economic losses due to lockdowns are difficult to estimate, but it would take years to restore countries to pre-outbreak status. For countries affected by the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), their health systems have been overwhelmed, resulting in an increase in the mortality rate caused by diseases or injuries. Furthermore, outbreaks, such as SARS-CoV-2, will induce serious, wide-ranging (and possibly long-lasting) psychological problems among, not only health workers, but ordinary citizens (this is due to isolation, quarantine, etc.). The aim of this paper is to present the most dangerous pathogens, as well as general characterizations, mechanisms of action, and treatments.","Janik, Edyta; Ceremuga, Michal; Niemcewicz, Marcin; Bijak, Michal",Medicina (Kaunas),103,12

There are two groups of tests, which are in widespread use to identify patients who have contracted the virus. The commonly used reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test becomes negative once viral shedding ceases by approximately 2-3weeks. Antibody tests directed to viral antigens become positive after the second week of infection. IgG antibody responses to the virus are muted in children, pregnant females, and those with mild symptoms. IgA and IgM antibodies rapidly wane, although IgG antibodies directed to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein are more durable. Current data show variability in the sensitivity of commercial and in-house antibody tests to SARS-CoV-2.Areas covered: The role of T cells in acute illness is uncertain, but long-term protection against the virus may rely on memory T cell responses. Measuring memory T cell responses is important for retrospective confirmation of cases, who may have been infected early in the pandemic before reliable RT-qPCR tests were available and whose SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may have become undetectable. Relevant peer-reviewed published references from PubMed are included up to 15 March 2021.Expert opinion: After surveying the literature, the authors present the case for urgent development of diagnostic T cell assays for SARS-CoV-2 by accredited laboratories.","Ameratunga, Rohan; Woon, See-Tarn; Jordan, Anthony; Longhurst, Hilary; Leung, Euphemia; Steele, Richard; Lehnert, Klaus; Snell, Russell; Brooks, Anna E S",Expert Rev Clin Immunol,103,1

To ascertain whether it is necessary to treat these patients in hospitals, especially in asymptomatic cases, we summarize and analyze the clinical and treatment characteristics of patients re-admitted to hospital with a second COVID-19 infection. Methods: Of the 141 COVID-19 cases admitted to the Wenzhou Central Hospital between January 17, 2020, to March 5, 2020, which were followed until March 30, 2020, 12 patients were re-admitted with a second COVID-19 infection. Data was collected and analyzed from their clinical records, lab indexes, commuted tomography (CT), and treatment strategies. Results: Most of the 141 patients had positive outcomes from treatment, with only 12 (8.5%) being re-admitted. In this sub-group: one (8.3%) had a fever, a high white blood cell count (WBC), and progressive CT changes; and one (8.3%) had increased transaminase. The PCR tests of these two patients returned negative results. Another 10 patients were admitted due to a positive PCR test result, seven of which were clinically asymptomatic. Compared to the CT imaging following their initial discharge, the CT imaging of all patients was significantly improved, and none required additional oxygen or mechanical ventilation during their second course of treatment. Conclusions: The prognoses of the re-admitted patients were good with no serious cases. We conclude that home treatment with concentrated medical observation is a safe and feasible course of treatment if the patient returns a positive PCR test result but does not display serious clinical symptoms. During medical observation, patients with underlying conditions should remain a primary focus, but most do not need to be re-admitted to the hospital.","Ye, Xinchun; Yuan, Yuping; Huang, Risheng; Cheng, Aiqiong; Yu, Zhijie; Huang, Ziyang; Chen, Rongrong; Jiang, Xiangao; Zheng, Yuanliang; Shi, Jichan",Front Public Health,103,26

METHODS: Retrospective review was performed to identify intensive care unit (ICU) patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 with computed tomography (CT) between March 20 and December 31, 2020. ICU patients without COVID-19 diagnosis with CT between March 20 and May 10, 2020 were also identified. CT image findings of colitis or terminal ileitis as well as supportive treatment including ventilator, vasopressors, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were recorded. Statistical analysis was performed to determine if clinical factors differed in patients with and without positive CT finding. RESULTS: Total 61 ICU patients were selected, including 32 (52%) COVID-19-positive patients and 29 (48%) non-COVID-19 patients. CT findings of colitis or terminal ileitis were identified in 27 patients (44%). Seventy-four percent of the patients with positive CT findings (20/27) received supportive therapies prior to CT, while 56% of the patients without abnormal CT findings (19/34) received supportive therapies. Vasopressor treatment was significantly associated with development of colitis and/or terminal ileitis (p = 0.04) and COVID-19 status was not significantly different between these groups (p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, there was significant correlation between prior vasopressor therapy and imaging findings of colitis or terminal ileitis in ICU patients, independent of COVID-19 status. Our observation raises a possibility that the reported COVID-19-related severe gastrointestinal complications and potential poor outcome could have been confounded by underlying severe critically ill status, and warrants a caution in diagnosis of gastrointestinal complication.","Martin, Sooyoung; Pierce, Jonathan; Kikano, Elias G; Vos, Derek; Tirumani, Sree Harsha; Ramaiya, Nikhil",Emerg Radiol,103,15

The research was conducted based on the keywords ""Coronavirus,"" ""COVID-19,"" and ""quarantine."" The references of the papers were also reviewed to find the ones not found in the databases. The guidelines published by reputable organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were used in this study. RESULTS: Although quarantine is applied as an important and primary solution in the outbreak of epidemics, in cases of pandemics, it may not be free of negative effects on individuals and public health. However, because of the need to reopen and restart social and economic activities, some changes should be made in lifestyles and work activities. Using cyberspace and telework can be helpful. As the findings showed, COVID-19 bubbles can be used to restore social communications. CONCLUSION: Using masks, avoiding unnecessary gatherings, complying with personal and social hygiene, and respecting social distancing can be valuable solutions that, if implemented properly, can decrease the rate of the disease significantly. It is also emphasized that quarantine is still necessary and important as the best solution for sick people and individuals who are suspected carriers of the disease.","Feiz Arefi, Maryam; Babaei-Pouya, Amin; Poursadeqiyan, Mohsen",Work,103,16

Autosomal recessive disorder of the Zellweger spectrum (ZSD) is a major subset of peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) that can be caused by mutations in any of the 14 PEX genes. Zellweger syndrome (ZS) is the foremost common and severe phenotype within the heterogeneous ZSD. However, missense mutations encode proteins with residual functions, which are associated with phenotypes that are milder than ZS. Mutations in the PEX1 gene are among the most prevalent. PEX1 and PEX6 proteins, belonging to the AAA family of ATPases, form a hexameric complex, which is associated with peroxisome membranes and essential for peroxisome biology. In this study, a two-month-old Iranian boy with hypotonia, poor feeding, and difficulty in breathing was diagnosed with Zellweger syndrome. The parents of the patient were second cousins and healthy and no similar cases were observed in the parents' family. The PEX1 gene was sequenced in the patient and his parents. The compound heterozygous mutations, p. Arg949Trp and p. Gly970Ala, were identified in the patient, while the parents were heterozygous for these alleles. Sequence analysis of the mutant PEX1 D2 domain revealed that mutation p. Arg949Trp precisely occurred in a conserved arginine residue (P4 Arg), which hinders the substrate processing of the complex. Several database records have reported mutation p. Arg949Trp(R949W) but its clinical significance is given as uncertain. We report here a novel mutation, p. Gly970Ala, which is not recorded before and may prevent proper interaction of PEX1 and PEX6 proteins. In summary, the clinical findings and peroxisome profile of the patient suggested that compound heterozygosity for these two missense mutations resulted in a nonfunctional PEX1/PEX6 complex causing the severe ZS phenotype.","Alamatsaz, Marzieh; Jalalypour, Farzaneh; Hashemi, Motahare-Sadat; Shafeghati, Yousef; Nasr-Esfahani, Mohammad Hossein; Ghaedi, Kamran",J. cell. biochem,103,14

However, with the new passage procedure, there was a significant increase in wettability of the surface. With the proposition of the chamber with 12 nozzles, the suspended droplet concentration in different regions increased, with an average increase of 266%.

An understanding of current and developing testing methods is important for interpreting test results. METHODS: We performed a literature review of current evidence surrounding SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing highlighting its utility, limitations, and implications for otolaryngologists. RESULTS: The currently accepted RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 has varying sensitivity according to which subsite of the aerodigestive tract is sampled. Nasal swab sensitivities appear to be about 70%. Chest CT imaging for screening purposes is not currently recommended. CONCLUSION: Due to the current sensitivity of RT-PCR based testing for SARS-CoV-2, a negative test cannot rule out COVID-19. Full PPE should be worn during high-risk procedures such as aerosol generating procedures even if testing is negative. Patients who test positive during screening should have their surgeries postponed if possible until asymptomatic and have tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.","Vinh, Daniel B; Zhao, Xiao; Kiong, Kimberley L; Guo, Theresa; Jozaghi, Yelda; Yao, Chris; Kelley, James M; Hanna, Ehab Y",Head Neck,103,16

To achieve this objective, it has been proposed to examine the distance learning experience of Jordanian Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) after the universities institution suspended face-to-face (traditional) courses delivery owing to novel Coronavirus’ (COVID-19) fears. Design/methodology/approach: This study expands upon unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 by incorporating contextual variables such as trust (TR), autonomy (AUT) and compatibility (CMP). Data collection has been carried out through an online survey, which targeted participants at public and private universities during the crisis time of coronavirus. Structural equation modelling has been used to validate the proposed research model. Findings: The outcomes revealed that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, TR and AUT were the significant predictors of distance learning acceptance in both samples. By identifying the factors affecting the acceptance of distance learning systems, it will be more useful to offer better services of distance learning. This will also help to demonstrate that distance learning will be capable of delivering the educational aims of HEIs to areas where a pandemic outbreak in the Middle East. Originality/value: Distance learning provides university students with quality education, engaging platforms and most significantly a safe teaching environment.

However, due to the intrinsic random fluctuations of the viral signal in the wastewater (due to e.g., dilution; transport and fate processes in sewer system; variation in the number of persons discharging; variations in virus excretion and water consumption per day) the subsequent prevalence analysis may result in misleading conclusions. It is thus helpful to apply data filtering techniques to reduce the noise in the signal. In this paper we investigate 13 smoothing algorithms applied to the virus signals monitored in four wastewater treatment plants in Austria. The parameters of the algorithms have been defined by an optimization procedure aiming for performance metrics. The results are further investigated by means of a cluster analysis. While all algorithms are in principle applicable, SPLINE, Generalized Additive Model and Friedman Super Smoother are recognized as superior methods in this context (with the latter two having a tendency to over-smoothing). A first analysis of the resulting datasets indicates the influence of catchment size for wastewater-based epidemiology as smaller communities both reveal a signal threshold before any relation with infection dynamics is visible and also a higher sensitivity towards infection clusters.","Arabzadeh, Rezgar; Gruenbacher, Daniel Martin; Insam, Heribert; Kreuzinger, Norbert; Markt, Rudolf; Rauch, Wolfgang",,103,16

Traditionally successful countermeasures such as synthetic over-sampling have had limited success with complex, structured data handled by deep learning models. In this work, we propose to use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) equipped with a generator network G, a discriminator network D and a classifier network C to remove the class-imbalance in visual data sets. The generator network is initialized with auto-encoder to make it stable. The discriminator D ensures that G adheres to class distribution of imbalanced class. In conventional methods, where Generator G competes with discriminator D in a min-max game, we propose to further add an additional classifier network to the original network. Now, the generator network tries to compete in a min-max game with Discriminator as well as the new classifier that we have introduced. An additional condition is enforced on generator network G to produce points in the convex hull of desired imbalanced class. Further the contention of adversarial game with classifier C, pushes conditional distribution learned by G towards the periphery of the respective class, compensating the problem of class imbalance. Experimental evidence shows that this initialization results in stable training of the network. We achieve state of the art performance on extreme visual classification task on the FashionMNIST, MNIST, SVHN, ExDark, MVTec Anomaly Detection dataset, Chest X-Ray dataset and others.","Deepshikha, Kumari; Naman, Anugunj",,103,11

SARS-CoV-2, a ß-coronavirus, is a highly contagious respiratory pathogen that causes a disease that has been termed the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Clinical experience thus far indicates that COVID-19 is highly heterogeneous, ranging from being asymptomatic and mild to severe and causing death. Host factors including age, sex, and comorbid conditions are key determinants of disease severity and progression. Aging itself is a prominent risk factor for severe disease and death from COVID-19. We hypothesize that age-related decline and dysregulation of immune function, i.e., immunosenescence and inflammaging play a major role in contributing to heightened vulnerability to severe COVID-19 outcomes in older adults. Much remains to be learned about the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We need to begin partitioning all immunological outcome data by age to better understand disease heterogeneity and aging. Such knowledge is critical not only for understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis but also for COVID-19 vaccine development.","Chen, Yiyin; Klein, Sabra L; Garibaldi, Brian T; Li, Huifen; Wu, Cunjin; Osevala, Nicole M; Li, Taisheng; Margolick, Joseph B; Pawelec, Graham; Leng, Sean X",Ageing Res Rev,103,16

The CWS causes significant distress and disability. While the relationship between CUD and psychosis has been extensively studied, the potential connection between CWS and psychosis has not received as much attention. CASE PRESENTATION: The CARE guideline's methodology is followed in the presentation of this case report. During the national lockdown decreed by the Spanish government for the containment of the CoronaVirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, a 29-year-old man suffers a CWS and a subsequent psychotic episode. He is admitted to a psychiatric unit, obtaining a rapid and complete response to treatment. DISCUSSION: Clinical and pathophysiological data that support the hypothesis of CWS-induced psychosis are discussed. Due to the increasing use of cannabis worldwide, we believe that more research is needed on the mental disturbances associated with CUD, including CWS and psychosis. On the other hand, the confinement and social distancing measures adopted in the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic could have restricted the availability and consumption of certain drugs, precipitating the emergence of withdrawal syndromes such as CWS.","Marín, Julen; Pérez de Mendiola, Xabier; Fernández, Sergio; Chart, Juan Pablo",J Addict Dis,103,1

However, studies on the association between methamphetamine use and adherence to antiretroviral treatment (ART) are limited and had inconsistent findings. This study aimed to determine the impact of methamphetamine use on adherence to ART among MSM living with HIV. From December 2018 to October 2019, MSM living with HIV were recruited (N = 351) and non-adherence to ART was defined as a Medication Adherence Report Scale score of <23. Overall, 16.0% of the participants reported methamphetamine use in the prior three months and 13.4% of the participants had non-adherence to ART. The proportion of non-adherence to ART among HIV-positive MSM were 28.6% and 10.5% with and without methamphetamine use, respectively. After controlling for demographics, illicit drug use, and co-morbidities, methamphetamine use during the prior three months was associated with a higher risk of non-adherence to ART (adjusted odds ratio = 3.08; 95% confidence intervals: 1.24-7.69). Compared with HIV-positive MSM with non-adherence to ART, HIV-positive MSM with good adherence to ART had a higher CD4 counts and were more likely to achieve an undetectable viral load. Since poor adherence to ART is associated with an increased HIV viral load and the risk of HIV transmission to others, our study suggests that it is imperative to screen HIV-positive patients for methamphetamine use and to provide effective therapy to reduce methamphetamine use and the associated non-adherence to ART.","Lai, Hsin-Hao; Kuo, Yen-Chun; Kuo, Chian-Jue; Lai, Yun-Ju; Chen, Marcelo; Chen, Yi-Tui; Chen, Chu-Chieh; Yen, Muh-Yong; Hu, Bor-Shen; Wang, Teng-Ho; Wang, Chien Chun; Kuo, Li-Lan; Yen, Tsen-Fang; Chuang, Pei-Hung; Yen, Yung-Feng",Sci Rep,103,20

Freshly collected autologous adipose tissue injected into perianal fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease seems to promote healing. We investigated this technique in patients with non-healing wounds after cleft-lift surgery for pilonidal sinus disease (PSD). METHOD: In a prospective interventional pilot study conducted at our institution autologous adipose tissue from the abdominal wall was harvested, and injected into chronic non-healing PS wounds after surgical revision, healing rate being the primary outcome. The wounds were left open. Patients were followed every 2 to 3 weeks until complete healing (skin coverage, no undermining). RESULTS: 7 male patients were included (mean age 24 ± 0,6 SD years) and complete healing was achieved in 6 patients (86%). Median time to healing was 90 days (range 36-403 days ) and mean follow-up time was 388± 45 days. All patients reported major symptom relief shortly after the procedure.

This is probably the first study from India on the knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward COVID-19. Presently, there is only 1 similar study from China. Methods A cross-sectional observational study was performed in a tertiary care hospital in India to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the participants toward COVID-19 during the pandemic. The participants had to answer a questionnaire in the language well understood by them. It pertained to their basic knowledge about this disease, their attitudes, and correct practices. The participants were either doctors, staff, patients, or relatives visiting the hospital. Results Among the various age groups, the highest proportion (57.21%) of very good knowledge was in the 20 to 30 years age group. Among the respondents, poor knowledge was seen in the patients. Overall, 47.99% participants had an extremely optimistic attitude, whereas &lt;50% doctors had extremely correct practices toward COVID-19. This is unacceptable during the ongoing pandemic and reveals scope for improvement.

The first wave of COVID-19 may have affected people in lower socioeconomic groups worse than the affluent. The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and the specificity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests in South Africa is not known. METHODS: We tested 405 volunteers representing all socioeconomic strata from the workforce of a popular shopping and tourist complex in central Cape Town with the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. We assessed the association between antibody positivity and COVID-19 symptom status, medical history, and sociodemographic variables. We tested 137 serum samples from healthy controls collected in Cape Town prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, to confirm the specificity of the assay in the local population. RESULTS: Of the 405 volunteers tested one month after the first peak of the epidemic in Cape Town, 96(23.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive. Of those who tested positive, 46(47.9%) reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in the previous 6 months. Seropositivity was significantly associated with living in informal housing, residing in a subdistrict with low income-per household, and having a low-earning occupation. The specificity of the assay was 98.54%(95%CI 94.82%-99.82%) in the pre-COVID controls. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high background seroprevalence in Cape Town, particularly in people of lower socioeconomic status. Almost half of cases are asymptomatic, and therefore undiagnosed by local testing strategies. These results cannot be explained by low assay specificity.","Shaw, Jane Alexandra; Meiring, Maynard; Cummins, Tracy; Chegou, Novel N; Claassen, Conita; Du Plessis, Nelita; Flinn, Marika; Hiemstra, Andriette; Kleynhans, Léanie; Leukes, Vinzeigh; Loxton, Andre G; MacDonald, Candice; Mtala, Nosipho; Reuter, Helmuth; Simon, Donald; Stanley, Kim; Tromp, Gerard; Preiser, Wolfgang; Malherbe, Stephanus T; Walzl, Gerhard",PLoS One,103,16

Methods: A 25-item questionnaire designed to assess the components of the objectives was tele-administered between October 2020 and January 2021 to the patients enrolled in the Indian Progressive Systemic Sclerosis Registry. Results: Of the 428 patients in the registry, 336 took part in the study. A scheduled outpatient visit was missed by 310 (92.3%) patients, and 75 (22.3%) skipped prescription drugs. During the pandemic, 75 (22.3%) had a family member lose a job. Financial difficulties were reported by 155 (46.1%), with 116 (34.5%) patients having to spend an additional INR 4000 (2000-10 000) [USD 54.9 (27.0-137.4)] to continue treatment. Although 35 patients (10.4%) had at least one symptom suggestive of COVID-19, infection was confirmed in only 4. None of them needed hospitalization or had adverse outcomes. Worsening of scleroderma was seen in 133 (39.6%) individuals, with 15 (4.5%) requiring hospitalization. Most (96%) of the patients were aware of infection prevention measures, and 91 (27.1%) had taken unproven prophylactic medications. Conclusion: Individuals with scleroderma in India have been affected during the pandemic owing to closure of hospital services, lack of transport, loss of jobs and the additional financial burden. Health-care providers should continue to educate patients to stay on their medications and encourage them to be vaccinated for COVID-19.","Kavadichanda, C.; Shobha, V.; Ghosh, P.; Wakhlu, A.; Bairwa, D.; Mohanan, M.; Janardana, R.; Sircar, G.; Sahoo, R.

However, paediatric data are scarce. METHODS: This paper contains a case report of five Swedish children and the long-term symptoms reported by their parents. It also includes a systematic literature review of the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science databases and the medRxiv/bioRxiv pre-print servers up to 2 November 2020. RESULTS: The five children with potential long COVID had a median age of 12 years (range 9-15) and four were girls. They had symptoms for 6-8 months after their clinical diagnoses of COVID-19. None were hospitalised at diagnosis, but one was later admitted for peri-myocarditis. All five children had fatigue, dyspnoea, heart palpitations or chest pain, and four had headaches, difficulties concentrating, muscle weakness, dizziness and sore throats. Some had improved after 6-8 months, but they all suffered from fatigue and none had fully returned to school. The systematic review identified 179 publications and 19 of these were deemed relevant and read in detail. None contained any information on long COVID in children. CONCLUSION: Children may experience similar long COVID symptoms to adults and females may be more affected.","Ludvigsson, Jonas F",Acta paediatr. scand,103,19

METHODS: A longitudinal study of 20 consecutive critically ill, delirious COVID-19 inpatients, assessed with the Charlson Comorbidity Index-Short Form (CCI-SF), COVID-19 Clinical Severity Scale (CCSS), Delirium Etiology Checklist, Delirium Motor Subtype Scale-4, and Delirium Diagnostic Tool-Provisional (DDT-Pro), was conducted. Correlational analysis of delirium severity (DDT-Pro) with each measure of clinical severity (CCI-SF and CCSS) and comparison of baseline DDT-Pro scores between patients who were living and those who were deceased at follow-up were conducted. RESULTS: Participants were 50-90 years old (male, 75%; hypertension, 60%). The prevalence of preexisting medical comorbidities (CCI-SF) was low and not correlated with delirium severity (p=0.193). Eighteen patients were on mechanical or high-flow noninvasive ventilation at baseline in the intensive care unit (ICU; CCSS scores 2-4). Delirium severity (DDT-Pro scores 0-6) correlated with COVID-19 severity (0.459, p=0.021). Delirium motor subtype was hyperactive in 75% of patients. There were three to four etiologies for delirium in each patient, most commonly organ insufficiency (100%), systemic infection (100%), and metabolic and endocrine disturbances (95%). The baseline DDT-Pro score was &#8804;4 for five (25%) patients who died before the final assessment, with a trend of being lower than that for survivors (&#967;2=3.398, p=0.065). CONCLUSIONS: Among inpatients with COVID-19, at least three different etiological categories were identified for delirium. ICU staff treating patients with severe cases of COVID-19 should anticipate a greater severity of delirium. Although multivariate analyses with larger study samples are needed, more severe delirium may herald greater risk of death among COVID-19 patients.","Velásquez-Tirado, Juan D; Trzepacz, Paula T; Franco, José G",J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci,103,16

Investigations are ongoing in the search for effective therapeutics, with clinical approaches evolving based upon such evidence. RECENT FINDINGS: The antiviral agent, remdesivir, and the immunomodulator, dexamethasone, are the first therapeutics for which there is evidence of efficacy from randomized trials. Subgroup analyses suggest remdesivir is beneficial in hospitalized patients whose severity of illness falls at the lower end of the spectrum, while dexamethasone is more beneficial in hospitalized patients whose severity of illness falls at the higher end of the spectrum. We recommend that inpatients who require supplemental oxygen but are not mechanically ventilated receive both remdesivir and dexamethasone, and inpatients who require mechanical ventilation receive dexamethasone monotherapy. Additional evidence regarding anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, convalescent plasma, and a variety of antiinterleukin therapies is forthcoming. SUMMARY: The body of evidence related to COVID-19 therapeutics continues to evolve and, as a result, management is likely to change with time. As new evidence is generated and published, the optimal approach to managing patients with COVID-19 should be reconsidered.","Wilson, Kevin C",Curr Opin Pulm Med,103,24

CONCLUSIONS.­: The HIV and other viral pandemics have been associated with a variety of hematologic complications that often cause significant morbidity and mortality in affected patients. HIV infection is associated with multiple hematologic disorders, many of which have a lower incidence in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy but still represent a major clinical problem for HIV-infected patients. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV-related hematologic complications, including HIV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders, has evolved in recent years. Other viral pandemics, including H1N1 influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, and COVID-19, have also been associated with hematologic complications of varying severity.

DESIGN: This cross-sectional survey study collected responses from 13 April 2020 until 30 April 2020. Students at US allopathic medical schools completed the survey online. RESULTS: 1,668 responses were analyzed. A total of 337 (20.2%) respondents thought the pandemic would affect their choice of specialty, with differences across class years: 15.2% (53) of first-years (MS1s), 26.4% (92) of second-years (MS2s), 23.7% (162) of third-years (MS3s), and 9.7% (22) of fourth-years (MS4s) (p < 0.0001). Among all classes, the most common reason chosen was inability to explore specialties of interest (244, 72.4%), and the second was inability to bolster their residency application (162, 48.1%). Out of the MS3s who chose the latter, the majority were concerned about recommendation letters (68, 81.0%) and away rotations (62, 73.8%). As high as 17.4% (119) of MS3s said they were more likely to take an extra year during medical school as a result of the pandemic. Region of the US, number of local COVID cases, and number of local COVID deaths had no effect on whether respondents thought the pandemic would affect their specialty choice. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that about one-fifth of surveyed medical students currently believe that the COVID-19 pandemic will affect their choice of specialty, with many of these citing concerns that they cannot explore specialties or obtain recommendation letters. With prolonged suspension of clinical rotations, targeted efforts by medical schools to address these concerns through enhanced virtual curriculum development and advising strategies will become increasingly important. Further study is needed to explore whether these cross-sectional student perspectives will manifest as changes in upcoming National Residency Matching Program data.","Byrnes, Yasmeen M; Civantos, Alyssa M; Go, Beatrice C; McWilliams, Tara L; Rajasekaran, Karthik",Med Educ Online,103,6

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to study factors associated with COVID-19 and AC in HCWs of a COVID-19 academic medical center. METHODS: This is a case-control study. Cases were either symptomatic or asymptomatic HCWs with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result between March 16 and May 21 of 2020. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated by means of multivariable logistic regression. In addition, each subject was followed for 14 days to inform outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred thirty of 249 (52.2%) symptomatic HCWs had COVID-19; 10 were hospitalized but none died. Of 987 asymptomatic HCWs,37 (3.7%) were AC; 6 of the remaining 950 asymptomatic HCWs with a negative PCR test result were found to be presymptomatic COVID-19 cases the following 14 days. Nurses were more frequently present in the COVID-19 group (51.5% vs. 37.0%), but multivariable analysis rendered non-significant results. After adjustment for age, comorbidities, and working place, factors found to be associated with AC were: working in wards as a nurse (aOR = 9.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-80.22, p = 0.045), kitchen personnel (aOR = 4.09, 95% CI = 1.55-10.83, p = 0.005), and being a physician (aOR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.03-0.54, p = 0.006).

These conditions may affect the course of many diseases, including migraine. Although it is possible that the quarantine measures for the current COVID-19 pandemic affect migraine burden, no information is currently available on this issue. Aim: In this study, we aimed to: (1) explore the possible changes in migraine frequency, severity, and days with acute medication intake during quarantine period; (2) evaluate possible differences in migraine outcomes in consideration of lifestyle changes, emotions, pandemic diffusion, and COVID-19 infection. Methods: We interviewed patients who were included in the observational Italian Headache Registry (Registro Italiano Cefalee, RICE), retrospectively collecting information on main headache features, lifestyle factors, emotions, individual infection status, and perception of COVID-19 for 2 months before (pre-quarantine) and after the beginning of the quarantine (quarantine). Inclusion criteria were: age > 18, diagnosis of migraine without aura, migraine with aura and chronic migraine, last in-person visit more than 3 months preceding the beginning of quarantine. Results: A total of 433 migraine subjects agreed to be interviewed. We found an overall reduction in headache frequency (9.42 ± 0.43 days with headache vs. 8.28 ± 0.41) and intensity (6.57 ± 0.19 vs. 6.59 ± 0.21) during the quarantine, compared to pre-quarantine. There was a correlation between improvement and number of days of stay-at-home. When results were stratified for geographic area, we found a tendency toward worsening of headache frequency in northern Italy. Disgust regarding viral infection corresponded to a minor improvement in migraine. Conclusions: Migraine patients showed a mild improvement of migraine features, probably attributable to resilient behavior toward pandemic distress. Disgust regarding the contagion whereas potentially favoring defensive behavior, could potentially worsen migraine. The spontaneous limitation of migraine burden during quarantine could favor patient follow-up via the use of telemedicine visits, reliable diaries, and frequent remote contacts.","Delussi, Marianna; Gentile, Eleonora; Coppola, Gianluca; Prudenzano, Addolorata Maria Pia; Rainero, Innocenzo; Sances, Grazia; Abagnale, Chiara; Caponnetto, Valeria; De Cesaris, Francesco; Frattale, Ilaria; Guaschino, Elena; Marcinnò, Andrea; Ornello, Raffaele; Pistoia, Francesca; Putortì, Alessia; Roca, Maria Elena; Roveta, Fausto; Lupi, Chiara; Trojano, Maria; Pierelli, Francesco; Geppetti, Pierangelo; Sacco, Simona; de Tommaso, Marina",Front Neurol,103,16

This study aims to strengthen global health in undergraduate medical education in Germany. Major objectives include: to review the current situation, explore changing demand for global health and introduce innovative teaching models and the drivers for change. Mixed methods and an explorative approach were applied, comprising a scoping review, online surveys carried out at Hanover Medical School, March/April 2020. Target groups were undergraduate medical students (n = 384) and additionally lecturers (n = 172), and finally new multiprofessional teaching courses initiated by students and developed collaboratively. The results reveal only slow pace of change on the level of the education system, while demand for global health education has increased markedly in all actor groups, but strongest in the group of students in the preclinical phase. Implementation of global health programmes illustrates how students can become change agents and enhance institutional innovation bottom-up. However, in order to achieve wider transformative potential, these efforts must be flanked by macro-level policy changes and integrated in future pandemic preparedness strategies.","Kreitlow, Annika; Steffens, Sandra; Jablonka, Alexandra; Kuhlmann, Ellen",Int. j. health plann. manage,103,20

Although unique in its transmission and virulence, COVID-19 is similar to zoonotic diseases, including other SARS variants (e.g., SARS-CoV) and MERS, in exhibiting severe flu-like symptoms and acute respiratory distress. Even at the molecular level, many parallels have been identified between SARS and COVID-19 so much so that the COVID-19 virus has been named SARS-CoV-2. These similarities have provided several opportunities to treat COVID-19 patients using clinical approaches that were proven to be effective against SARS. Importantly, the identification of similarities in how SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 access the host, replicate, and trigger life-threatening pathological conditions have revealed opportunities to repurpose drugs that were proven to be effective against SARS. In this article, we first provided an overview of COVID-19 etiology vis-à-vis other zoonotic diseases, particularly SARS and MERS. Then, we summarized the characteristics of droplets/aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients and how they aid in the transmission of the virus among people. Moreover, we discussed the molecular mechanisms that enable SARS-CoV-2 to access the host and become more contagious than other betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV. Further, we outlined various approaches that are currently being employed to diagnose and symptomatically treat COVID-19 in the clinic. Finally, we reviewed various approaches and technologies employed to develop vaccines against COVID-19 and summarized the attempts to repurpose various classes of drugs and novel therapeutic approaches.","Salian, Vrishali S; Wright, Jessica A; Vedell, Peter T; Nair, Sanjana; Li, Chenxu; Kandimalla, Mahathi; Tang, Xiaojia; Carmona Porquera, Eva M; Kalari, Krishna R; Kandimalla, Karunya K",Mol. pharm,103,4

Their education incorporates practice-based training in the role of the IC in different scenarios, using live simulation (LS) on a physical training ground, but also virtual simulation (VS) in dedicated simulation facilities. LS is considered as the most valuable simulation method, and even though added values of VS have been shown and the possibility of remote virtrual simulation (RVS) has been discussed, there have been hesitations towards VS and RVS implementation. In March 2020, all IC training onsite was stopped by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), due to the Covid-19 restictions on no gathering of people. At the same time the need for IC final exams forced the decision to conduct these using RVS for one IC class. This was the first RVS IC examination in its kind, to our recent knowledge. This paper aims to examine enablers for the implementation of RVS in IC's education. The study behind it was conducted in two steps, a pilot study during the development of the RVS scenarios and a field study conducted during the IC examination using RVS. The results describe the opportunities opening up for RVS, and necessary prerequisites at the responsible organizations. The possibilities for the implementation are shown by discussing acceptance of the RVS as a substitute for LS in the current IC educational curriculum.","Wijkmark, C.

The corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exerted unique physical and emotional demands on healthcare workers, however little is known about the emotional wellbeing of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in resource-restricted settings. This study investigated the prevalence of psychological distress, and sleep problems in healthcare workers in a COVID-19 referral hospital in Nigeria. METHODS: A total of 303 healthcare workers were interviewed with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to evaluate psychological distress, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to assess multidimensional aspects of sleep, including quality, latency, duration, habitual efficiency, disturbances, use of sleeping medications and daytime dysfunction. RESULTS: The participants were mostly males, 183(60.4%) and mean age was 38.8(SD = 8.9) years. Most of the participants were married (70.3%), had spent less than 10 years in service (72.9%), and had no medical comorbidity (92.1%). The prevalence of psychological distress was 23.4%, and six in every ten participants reported sleep problems. The largest proportion of participants reported difficulty in sleep latency (81.5%), duration (71.3%), and daytime dysfunction (69.6%), while approximately one third (32%) each reported using sleep medication, and had difficulty with sleep quality. Psychological distress was inter-related with poor sleep problems (p = 0.001; effect size = 0.2). CONCLUSION: The prevalence rates of psychological distress and sleep problems during the COVID-19 pandemic were several folds the rates previously reported in similar contexts. Preventative psychosocial support services for healthcare workers are indicated. The creation of a culturally-sensitive interdisciplinary blueprint for locally-viable actions model are strongly suggested ahead of future emergency situations.","Olagunju, Andrew T; Bioku, Ayodeji A; Olagunju, Tinuke O; Sarimiye, Foluke O; Onwuameze, Obiora E; Halbreich, Uriel",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,103,1

Orthodox (Haredi) Jewish neighbourhoods in England experienced high incidences of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020-21 and measles outbreaks (2018-19) due to suboptimal childhood vaccination coverage. The objective of our study was to explore how the coronavirus vaccination programme (CVP) was co-delivered between public health services and an Orthodox Jewish health organisation. Methods included 28 semi-structured interviews conducted virtually with public health professionals, community welfare and religious representatives, and household members. We examined CVP delivery from the perspectives of those involved in organising services and vaccine beneficiaries. Interview data was contextualised within debates of the CVP in Orthodox (Haredi) Jewish print and social media. Thematic analysis generated five considerations: i) Prior immunisation-related collaboration with public health services carved a role for Jewish health organisations to host and promote coronavirus vaccination sessions, distribute appointments, and administer vaccines ii) Public health services maintained responsibility for training, logistics, and maintaining vaccination records; iii) The localised approach to service delivery promoted vaccination in a minority with historically suboptimal levels of coverage; iv) Co-delivery promoted trust in the CVP, though a minority of participants maintained concerns around safety; v) Provision of CVP information and stakeholders response to situated (context-specific) challenges and concerns. Drawing on this example of CVP co-delivery, we propose that a localised approach to delivering immunisation programmes could address service provision gaps in ways that involve trusted community organisations. Localisation of vaccination services can include communication or implementation strategies, but both approaches involve consideration of investment, engagement and coordination, which are not cost-neutral. Localising vaccination services in collaboration with welfare groups raises opportunities for the on-going CVP and other immunisation programmes, and constitutes an opportunity for ethnic and religious minorities to collaborate in safeguarding community health.","Kasstan, Ben; Mounier-Jack, Sandra; Letley, Louise; Gaskell, Katherine M; Roberts, Chrissy h; Stone, Neil; Lal, Sham; Eggo, Rosalind M; Marks, Michael; Chantler, Tracey",,103,1

However, the imaging risk factors for poor clinical outcomes remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to assess the imaging characteristics and risk factors associated with adverse composite endpoints in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: This retrospective cohort study enrolled patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 24 designated hospitals in Jiangsu province, China, between 10 January and 18 February 2020. Clinical and initial CT findings at admission were extracted from medical records. Patients aged < 18 years or without available clinical or CT records were excluded. The composite endpoints were admission to ICU, acute respiratory failure occurrence, or shock during hospitalization. The volume, density, and location of lesions, including ground-glass opacity (GGO) and consolidation, were quantitatively analyzed in each patient. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify the risk factors among age and CT parameters associated with the composite endpoints. Results: In this study, 625 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled; among them, 179 patients without an initial CT at admission and 25 patients aged < 18 years old were excluded and 421 patients were included in analysis. The median age was 48.0 years and the male proportion was 53% (224/421). During the follow-up period, 64 (15%) patients had a composite endpoint.

Meteorological parameters are reportedly crucial factors affecting respiratory infectious disease epidemics; however, the effect of meteorological parameters on COVID-19 remains controversial. This study investigated the effects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19, which has useful implications for policymakers and the public. Daily data on meteorological conditions, new cases and new deaths of COVID-19 were collected for 166 countries (excluding China) as of March 27, 2020. Log-linear generalized additive model was used to analyze the effects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19, with potential confounders controlled for, including wind speed, median age of the national population, Global Health Security Index, Human Development Index and population density. Our findings revealed that temperature and relative humidity were both negatively related to daily new cases and deaths. A 1 °C increase in temperature was associated with a 3.08% (95% CI: 1.53%, 4.63%) reduction in daily new cases and a 1.19% (95% CI: 0.44%, 1.95%) reduction in daily new deaths, whereas a 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 0.85% (95% CI: 0.51%, 1.19%) reduction in daily new cases and a 0.51% (95% CI: 0.34%, 0.67%) reduction in daily new deaths. The results remained robust when different lag structures and the sensitivity analysis were used. These findings provide preliminary evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic may be partially suppressed with temperature and humidity increases. However, active measures must be taken to control the source of infection, block transmission and prevent further spread of COVID-19.","Wu, Yu; Jing, Wenzhan; Liu, Jue; Ma, Qiuyue; Yuan, Jie; Wang, Yaping; Du, Min; Liu, Min",Sci Total Environ,103,33

We investigate UK cardiac surgery outcomes during the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included all adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery between 1st March and 30th April 2020 in nine UK centres. Data was obtained and linked locally from the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Adult Cardiac Surgery database, the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre database and local electronic systems. The anonymised datasets were analysed by the lead centre. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, propensity score matching (PSM), conditional logistic regression and hierarchical quantile regression. RESULTS: Of 755 included individuals, 53 (7.0%) had Covid-19. Comparing those with and without Covid-19, those with Covid-19 had increased mortality (24.5% v 3.5%, p < 0.0001) and longer post-operative stay (11 days v 6 days, p = 0.001), both of which remained significant after PSM. Patients with a pre-operative Covid-19 diagnosis recovered in a similar way to non-Covid-19 patients. However, those with a post-operative Covid-19 diagnosis remained in hospital for an additional 5 days (12 days v 7 days, p = 0.024) and had a considerably higher mortality rate compared to those with a pre-operative diagnosis (37.1% v 0.0%, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: To mitigate against the risks of Covid-19, particularly the post-operative burden, robust and effective pre-surgery diagnosis protocols alongside effective strategies to maintain a Covid-19 free environment are needed. Dedicated cardiac surgery hubs could be valuable in achieving safe and continual delivery of cardiac surgery.","Sanders, Julie; Akowuah, Enoch; Cooper, Jackie; Kirmani, Bilal H; Kanani, Mazyar; Acharya, Metesh; Jeganathan, Reuben; Krasopoulos, George; Ngaage, Dumbor; Deglurkar, Indu; Yiu, Patrick; Kendall, Simon; Oo, Aung Ye",J Cardiothorac Surg,103,28

Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted using EMBASE, PubMed/Medline, and Google Scholar from January 2020 to 7 January 2021 to identify all studies describing clinical profile, outcome and mortality rates regarding DKA, HHS, DKA/HHS and EDKA cases in COVID-19 patients. The appropriate Joanna Briggs Institute tools were used for quality assessment; quality of evidence was approached using GRADE. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess correlations between clinical characteristics and outcome based on case reports. Combined mortality rates (CMR) were estimated from data reported in case report series, cross-sectional studies, and meta-analyses. The protocol was submitted to PROSPERO (ID: 229356/230737). Results: From 312 identified publications, 44 were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Critical COVID-19 necessitating ICU (P = 3 × 10-8), DKA/HHS presence (P = 0.021), and AKI (P = 0.037) were independently correlated with death. Increased COVID-19 severity (P = 0.003), elevated lactates (P < 0.001), augmented anion gap (P < 0.001), and AKI (P = 0.002) were associated with DKA/HHS. SGLT-2i were linked with EDKA (P = 0.004) and negatively associated with AKI (P = 0.023). CMR was 27.1% (95% CI 11.2-46.9%) with considerable heterogeneity (I 2 = 67%). Conclusion: Acute diabetes-related metabolic emergencies in COVID-19 patients lead to increased mortality; key determinants are critical COVID-19 illness, coexistence of DKA/HHS and AKI. Previous SGLT-2i treatment, though associated with EDKA, might preserve renal function in COVID-19 patients.

A recent experimental study has suggested an increased toxicity of hydroxychloroquine in association with metformin in mice. OBJECTIVE: The present study was undertaken to investigate the reality of this putative drug-drug interaction between hydroxychloroquine and metformin using pharmacovigilance data. METHODS: Using VigiBase®, the WHO pharmacovigilance database, we performed a disproportionality analysis (case/non-case study). Cases were reports of fatal outcomes with the drugs of interest and non-cases were all other reports for these drugs registered between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2019. Data with hydroxychloroquine (or metformin) alone were compared with the association hydroxychloroquine + metformin. Results are reported as ROR (reporting odds ratio) with their 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Of the 10,771 Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR) involving hydroxychloroquine, 52 were recorded as 'fatal outcomes'. In comparison with hydroxychloroquine alone, hydroxychloroquine + metformin was associated with an ROR value of 57.7 (23.9-139.3). In comparison with metformin alone, hydroxychloroquine + metformin was associated with an ROR value of 6.0 (2.6-13.8). CONCLUSION: Our study identified a signal for the association hydroxychloroquine + metformin that appears to be more at risk of fatal outcomes (particularly by completed suicides) than one of the two drugs when given alone.","Montastruc, Jean-Louis; Toutain, Pierre-Louis",Drug Saf,103,24

The so-called 'exponential growth bias' is of new relevance in the context of COVID-19, because it explains why humans have fundamental difficulties to grasp the magnitude of a spreading epidemic. Here, we addressed the question, whether logarithmic scaling and contextual framing of epidemiological data affect the anticipation of exponential growth. Our findings show that underestimations were most pronounced when growth curves were linearly scaled and framed in the context of a more advanced epidemic progression. For logarithmic scaling, estimates were much more accurate, on target for growth rates around 31%, and not affected by contextual framing. We conclude that the logarithmic depiction is conducive for detecting exponential growth during an early phase as well as resurgences of exponential growth.","Hutzler, F.; Richlan, F.; Leitner, M.

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of 4-342 primary and secondary school students from Shanghai, China was conducted during March 13-23, 2020. Besides demographic information, psychological distress (including depression, anxiety, and stress), life satisfaction, perceived impact of home quarantine, and parent-child discussions on COVID-19 were assessed. RESULTS: The three most prevalent symptoms were: anxiety (24.9%), depression (19.7%), and stress (15.2%). Participants were generally satisfied with life and 21.4% became more satisfied with life during school closures. Senior grades were positively correlated with psychopathological symptoms and negatively associated with life satisfaction, whereas the perceived benefit from home quarantine and parent-child discussions on COVID-19 were negatively correlated with psychopathological symptoms and positively correlated with life satisfaction. Among participants who perceived no benefit from home quarantine, those who had discussions with their parents about COVID-19 experienced less depression, anxiety, and stress. LIMITATIONS: Limitations included the inability to infer the casual relationship, no parental report for mental health of children aged 6 to 9, and the inadequate measurement of parent-child discussion. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health problems and resilience co-existed in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak. Given the important role of parent-child discussions, open communication between parents and children about the pandemic should be encouraged to help children and adolescents cope with mental health problems in public health crisis.","Tang, Suqin; Xiang, Mi; Cheung, Teris; Xiang, Yu-Tao",J Affect Disord,103,16

Results: Eleven patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were included. CT findings assessed at the three time points showed that all patients had ground-glass opacities (GGO) and consolidation and mixed pattern at intubation. Consolidation and mixed pattern disappeared in most of the patients whereas GGO persisted in all patients at 1-month follow-up. In addition to GGO, a subpleural line and bronchus distortion and bronchial dilatation were frequent findings. The degree of resolution of GGO varied depending on each patient. The GGO score correlated significantly with the time from symptoms onset to initiation of steroid therapy (rho = 0.707, p = 0.015). Conclusions: At 1-month follow-up after discharge, non-GGO lesions were absorbed almost completely, and GGO were a predominant CT manifestation. Starting steroid therapy earlier after onset of symptoms in severe COVID-19 pneumonia may reduce the extent of GGO at 1-month follow-up.","Irizato, N.; Matsuura, H.; Okada, A.; Ueda, K.; Yamamura, H.",Bulletin of the National Research Centre (Cairo),103,10

Here, we studied humoral and cellular immune responses to wild type SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of concern in a cohort of 121 BNT162b2 mRNA-vaccinated health care workers (HCW). Twenty-three HCW recovered from mild COVID-19 disease and exhibited a recall response with high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific functional antibodies and virus-specific T cells after a single vaccination. Specific immune responses were also detected in seronegative HCW after one vaccination, but a second dose was required to reach high levels of functional antibodies and cellular immune responses in all individuals. Vaccination-induced antibodies cross-neutralized the variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, but the neutralizing capacity and Fc-mediated functionality against B.1.351 was consistently 2- to 4-fold lower than to the homologous virus. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with peptide pools spanning the mutated S regions of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 to detect cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells with variants. Importantly, we observed no differences in CD4+ T-cell activation in response to variant antigens, indicating that the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 S proteins do not escape T-cell-mediated immunity elicited by the wild type S protein. In conclusion, this study shows that some variants can partially escape humoral immunity induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or BNT162b2 vaccination, but S-specific CD4+ T-cell activation is not affected by the mutations in the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants.","Geers, Daryl; Shamier, Marc C; Bogers, Susanne; den Hartog, Gerco; Gommers, Lennert; Nieuwkoop, Nella N; Schmitz, Katharina S; Rijsbergen, Laurine C; van Osch, Jolieke A T; Dijkhuizen, Emma; Smits, Gaby; Comvalius, Anouskha; van Mourik, Djenolan; Caniels, Tom G; van Gils, Marit J; Sanders, Rogier W; Oude Munnink, Bas B; Molenkamp, Richard; de Jager, Herbert J; Haagmans, Bart L; de Swart, Rik L; Koopmans, Marion P G; van Binnendijk, Robert S; de Vries, Rory D; GeurtsvanKessel, Corine H",Sci. immunol,103,20

Classes were moved online, students had to leave dorms and move; they had to forgo regular meetings with their peers. Subsequently, a vital demand for examining students' mental health emerged. The data were collected at a time when universities in Poland were under lockdowns. Participants represented students of many different fields of study. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) was used. Student's subjective evaluation of online learning and their adaptation to academic life shifts were reviewed. A total of 1123 participants took part in this study. Relationship analysis included tests, such as U Mann-Whitney, appropriate for specific variables. The impact of variables connected with the pandemic on the GHQ scores was tested using multivariate regression analysis. The results were considered significant at a p-value set at 0.05. Overall, 76.96% of the participants manifested psychopathological symptoms measured by the GHQ. Four demographical variables were possibly associated with the GHQ scores: female sex, living in a big city, necessity to move back home, and being in a relationship. Negative correlations between subjective evaluation of variables concerning e-learning, such as its efficiency or quality, and the GHQ scores were found. Some variables were found to be potential protective factors, whereas others could have contributed to worsened mental health. The study provides data on students' worsened mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the shifts in academic life it caused. Therefore, recommendations for early psychosocial interventions among students are strongly advised.","Wieczorek, Tomasz; Kolodziejczyk, Agata; Ciulkowicz, Marta; Maciaszek, Julian; Misiak, Blazej; Rymaszewska, Joanna; Szczesniak, Dorota",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),103,1

Multiple vaccine candidates are under development, and several vaccines are currently available. Efforts need to be undertaken to counter the threat of the global COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We generated a Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, EBY100/pYD1-RBD, in which the full-length receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was expressed on the surface of yeast. Mice vaccinated orally with unadjuvanted EBY100/pYD1-RBD could produce significant humoral and mucosal responses as well as robust cellular immune responses. Notably, EBY100/pYD1-RBD elicited a mixed Th1/Th2-type cellular immune response with a Th1-biased immune response in a mouse model. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the importance of the RBD as a key target to design and develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and provide evidence of oral administration of a S. cerevisiae-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine eliciting significant immune responses. Most importantly, the S. cerevisiae surface display system can serve as a universal technology platform and be applied to develop other oral viral or bacterial vaccines.","Gao, Tong; Ren, Yi; Li, Shuangqin; Lu, Xin; Lei, Han",Microb Cell Fact,103,23

The analysis was descriptive. RESULTS: We mailed 1390 packages between May 2016 and September 2020. Of the 83% (1157/1390) of abortions for which we obtained outcome information, 95% (1103/1157) were completed without a procedure. Participants made 70 unplanned visits to emergency rooms or urgent care centers for reasons related to the abortion (6%), and 10 serious adverse events occurred, including 5 transfusions (0.4%). Enrollment increased substantially with the onset of COVID-19. Although a screening ultrasound was required, sites determined in 52% (346/669) of abortions that occurred during COVID that those participants should not get the test to protect their health. Use of urine pregnancy test to confirm abortion completion increased from 67% (144/214) in the 6 months prior to COVID to 90% (602/669) in the 6 months during COVID. Nearly all satisfaction questionnaires (99%, 1013/1022) recorded that participants were satisfied with the service. CONCLUSIONS: This direct-to-patient telemedicine service was safe, effective, and acceptable, and supports the claim that there is no medical reason for mifepristone to be dispensed in clinics as required by the Food and Drug Administration. In some cases, participants did not need to visit any facilities to obtain the service, which was critical to protecting patient safety during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chong, Erica; Shochet, Tara; Raymond, Elizabeth; Platais, Ingrida; Anger, Holly A; Raidoo, Shandhini; Soon, Reni; Grant, Melissa S; Haskell, Susan; Tocce, Kristina; Baldwin, Maureen K; Boraas, Christy M; Bednarek, Paula H; Banks, Joey; Coplon, Leah; Thompson, Francine; Priegue, Esther; Winikoff, Beverly",Contraception,103,10

Cancer patients are more susceptible to infection and tumor history is defined as an important factor of poor prognosis, which challenges both doctors and patients. For metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, maintenance therapy is the optimal choice. The patients with tumor progression or poor biological behavior should receive or continue combination chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy should reduce the intensity of treatment and shorten the therapy time. Fever patients during chemotherapy need to receive differential diagnosis and screening according to national standards.

Although recent research has supported the effectiveness of telehealth delivery of a variety of interventions for children, the literature has focused very little on childhood posttraumatic stress disorder. This pilot study examined the feasibility and potential effectiveness of trauma-focused cognitive- behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) delivered via telepsychotherapy in community-based locations of either schools or patient homes. Telepsychotherapy treatment was delivered to 70 traumaexposed youth in 7 underserved communities. Of these, 88.6% completed a full course of TF-CBT and 96.8% of these treatment completers no longer met diagnostic criteria for a trauma-related disorder at posttreatment. Results demonstrated clinically meaningful symptom change posttreatment, with large effect sizes evident for both youthand caregiver-reported reduction in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. The results observed in this pilot evaluation are promising and provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility and effectiveness of this novel treatment format. The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented need to rethink how mental health services are delivered, which is particularly applicable to high base rate conditions related to posttraumatic stress. Given the existing network of nationally certified TF-CBT therapists, and many international TF-CBT therapists, these findings suggest the potential for providing effective and accessible telepsychotherapy intervention during this public health crisis (as well as those that will occur in the future).","Stewart, Regan W.; Orengo-Aguayo, Rosaura; Young, John; Wallace, Megan M.; Cohen, Judith A.; Mannarino, Anthony P.; de Arellano, Michael A.",J.

Our goal was to develop a strategy to predict high titers of nAbs based on the results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays and the clinical characteristics of CP donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 214 CP donors were enrolled and tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG) using two commercial immunoassays: EUROIMMUN (ELISA) and Abbott (Chemiluminescence). Quantification of nAbs was performed using the Cytopathic Effect-based Virus Neutralization test. Three criteria for identifying donors with nAbs &#8805; 1:160 were tested: - C1: Curve ROC; - C2: Conditional decision tree considering only the IA results and - C3: Conditional decision tree including both the IA results and the clinical variables. RESULTS: The performance of the immunoassays was similar referring to both S/CO and predictive value for identifying nAbs titers &#8805;1:160. Regarding the studied criteria for identifying CP donors with high nAbs titers: (a) C1 showed 76.1% accuracy if S/CO = 4.65, (b) C2 presented 76.1% accuracy if S/CO &#8805;4.57 and (c) C3 had 71.6% accuracy if S/CO was &#8805;4.57 or if S/CO was between 2.68-4.57 and the last COVID-19-related symptoms were recent (within 19 days). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays (S/CO) can be used to predict high anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAbs titers. This study has proposed different criteria for identifying donors with &#8805;1:160 nAbs titers, all with high efficacy.","Mendrone-Junior, Alfredo; Dinardo, Carla Luana; Ferreira, Suzete Cleuza; Nishya, Anna; Salles, Nanci Alves; de Almeida Neto, Cesar; Hamasaki, Debora Toshei; Facincani, Tila; de Oliveira Alves, Lucas Bassolli; Machado, Rafael Rahal Guaragna; Araujo, Danielle Bastos; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Rocha, Vanderson; Sabino, Ester Cerdeira",Transfusion,103,15

There is anecdotal evidence of reduction in organ donation and transplantation activity across the world. METHODS: The weekly organ donation and liver transplant numbers over a 3-month period (Feb 17, 2020, till May 17, 2020) for the United States, United Kingdom, and India were compared with their previous year's activity. Liver transplant activity in 6 centers from these countries with varying local COVID-19 caseload was also compared. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant contraction in organ donation and liver transplantation in all 3 countries. Peak reduction ranged from 25% in the United States to over 80% in the United Kingdom and India. The reduction was different for deceased donor and living donor liver transplantation and varied between centers within a country. There was early evidence of recovery of deceased donation in the United States and United Kingdom and resumption of living donor liver transplantation activity in India toward the end of the study period. A number of policy changes were undertaken at national and transplant center levels to ensure safe transplantation despite significant redirection of resources to combat the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: There was a substantial reduction in organ donation and liver transplantation activity across the 3 countries with signs of recovery toward the end of the study period. Multiple factors including COVID-19 severity, stress on resources and influence of regulatory agencies and local factors are responsible for the reduction and recovery.","Reddy, Mettu S; Hakeem, Abdul R; Klair, Tarunjeet; Marcon, Francesca; Mathur, Abhishek; Samstein, Benjamin; Mohanka, Ravi; Mathur, Surendra K; Prachalias, Andreas; Menon, Krishna V; Muiesan, Paolo; Rela, Mohamed; Emond, Jean C",Transplantation,103,21

We registered consultations and telephone contacts and the proportion of these that were supplied with diagnostic codes for respiratory infections and three non-specific diagnostic codes. RESULTS: The number of consultations per year increased from 1 402 452 in 2008 to 1 417 395 in 2019, a relative increase of 1 %. The number of telephone contacts per year increased from 286 515 in 2008 to 684 773 in 2019, a relative increase of 139 %. Out-of-hours contacts coded with non-specific diagnoses increased nearly thirteenfold, from 40 280 to 514 715.

Thus, information on the sero-status of nephrology personnel might be crucial for patient protection; however, limited information exists about the presence of SARS-CoV­2 antibodies in asymptomatic individuals. METHODS: We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV­2 IgG and IgM antibodies among healthcare workers of a tertiary care kidney center during the the first peak phase of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis in Austria using an orthogonal test strategy and a total of 12 commercial nucleocapsid protein or spike glycoprotein-based assays as well as Western blotting and a neutralization assay. RESULTS: At baseline 60 of 235 study participants (25.5%, 95% confidence interval, CI 20.4-31.5%) were judged to be borderline positive or positive for IgM or IgG using a high sensitivity/low specificity threshold in one test system. Follow-up analysis after about 2 weeks revealed IgG positivity in 12 (5.1%, 95% CI: 2.9-8.8%) and IgM positivity in 6 (2.6%, 95% CI: 1.1-5.6) in at least one assay. Of the healthcare workers 2.1% (95% CI: 0.8-5.0%) showed IgG nucleocapsid antibodies in at least 2 assays. By contrast, positive controls with proven COVID-19 showed antibody positivity among almost all test systems. Moreover, serum samples obtained from healthcare workers did not show SARS-CoV­2 neutralizing capacity, in contrast to positive controls. CONCLUSION: Using a broad spectrum of antibody tests the present study revealed inconsistent results for SARS-CoV­2 seroprevalence among asymptomatic individuals, while this was not the case among COVID-19 patients.

However, there is limited evidence as to whether nursing home residents, who account for a disproportionate share of COVID-19 deaths and are often managed conservatively in the nursing home instead of being admitted to the hospital, have experienced similar mortality reductions. In this study we examined changes in thirty-day mortality rates between March and November 2020 among 12,271 nursing home residents with COVID-19. We found that adjusted mortality rates significantly declined from a high of 20.9 percent in early April to 11.2 percent in early November. Mortality risk declined for residents with both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections and for residents with both high and low clinical complexity. The mechanisms driving these trends are not entirely understood, but they may include improved clinical management within nursing homes, improved personal protective equipment supply and use, and genetic changes in the virus.","Kosar, Cyrus M; White, Elizabeth M; Feifer, Richard A; Blackman, Carolyn; Gravenstein, Stefan; Panagiotou, Orestis A; McConeghy, Kevin; Mor, Vincent",Health Aff (Millwood),103,23

METHODS: We evaluated 11 risk stratification scores in a binational retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia in Sao Paulo and Barcelona: Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), CURB, CURB-65, qSOFA, Infectious Disease Society of America and American Thoracic Society Minor Criteria, REA-ICU, SCAP, SMART-COP, CALL, COVID GRAM and 4C. The primary and secondary outcomes were 30-day in-hospital mortality and seven-day intensive-care unit (ICU) admission respectively. We compared their predictive performance using the area under the ROC curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, calibration plots and decision curve analysis. RESULTS: Of 1363 patients, the mean (SD) age was 61 (16) years. The 30-day in-hospital mortality rate was 24.6% (228/925) in Sao Paulo and 21.0% (92/438) in Barcelona. For in-hospital mortality, we found higher AUROCs for PSI (0.79, 95%CI 0.77-0.82), 4C (0.78, 95%CI 0.75-0.81), COVID GRAM (0.77, 95%CI 0.75-0.80), and CURB-65 (0.74 95%CI 0.72-0.77). Results were similar for both countries. For most 1-20% threshold range in decision curve analysis, PSI would avoid a higher number of unnecessary interventions, followed by the 4C score. All scores had poor performance (AUROC&lt;0.65) for seven-day ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Recent clinical COVID-19 assessment scores had comparable performance to standard pneumonia assessment tools. Because it is expected that new scores outperform older ones during development, external validation studies are needed before recommending their use.","Neto, F. L.; Marino, L.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalized in two COVID Centers were enrolled. All patients performed blood gas analysis and lung ultrasound (LUS) at admission. The LUS acquisition was based on standard sequence of 14 peculiar anatomic landmarks with a score between 0-3 based on impairment of LUS picture. Total score was computed with their sum with a total score ranging 0 to 42, according to Soldati LUS score. We evaluated the course of hospitalization until either discharge or death, the ventilatory support and the transition in intensive care if needed. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-six patients were included in the final analysis. Most of patients presented moderate-to-severe respiratory failure (FiO2 <20%, PaO2 <60 mmHg) and consequent recommendation to invasive mechanic ventilation (CPAP/NIV/OTI). The median ultrasound thoracic score was 28 (IQR 18-36) and most of patients could be ascertained either in a score 2 (40%) or score 3 pictures (24.4%). The bivariate correlation analysis displayed statistically significant and high positive correlations between the LUS score and the following parameters: ventilation (rho=0.481, p<0.001), lactates (rho=0.464, p<0.001), dyspnea (rho=0.398, p=0.001) mortality (rho=0.410, p=0.001). Conversely, P/F (rho= -0.663, p<0.001), pH (rho = -0.363, p=0.003) and pO2 (rho = -0.400 p=0.001) displayed significant negative correlations. CONCLUSIONS: LUS score improve the workflow and provide an optimal management both in early diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 related lung pathology.","Lugara, M; Oliva, G; Pafundi, P C; Tamburrini, S; Nevola, R; Gjeloshi, K; Ricozzi, C; Imbriani, S; Padula, A; Aprea, C; Meo, L; Cozzolino, D; Cuomo, G; Marrone, A; Romano, C; Fiorini, V; Coppola, M G; Corvino, M; Perrella, A; Ponti, G; Nunnari, G; Ranieri, R; Ruosi, C; Sasso, F C; Adinolfi, L E; Rinaldi, L",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,103,22

In this study, trained volunteers providing befriending for residents with symptoms of depression, anxiety and loneliness switched to remote befriending during COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to gauge volunteer perceptions of the switch. Methods: A qualitative phenomenological approach was used to understand how switching to remote befriending impacted on volunteers and residents. A convenience sample of 18 participants responded to questions either in individual or group interviews. Results: Volunteers adapted their befriending visits, switching from face to face visits to remote options. The format was decided collaboratively. Hearing impairments hindered phone calls. Residents sometimes felt uncomfortable with digital technology but on the whole, the change to remote ""visiting"" was accepted. Conclusions: Further research is being conducted to gauge mental health outcomes for residents. Most volunteers and residents accepted the switch to remote befriending as better than no contact. Clinical implications: Volunteers can provide valuable support for residents living with social isolation during COVID-19. The format for social support needs to be decided collaboratively between volunteer and resident.","Fearn, Marcia; Harper, Robin; Major, Georgia; Bhar, Sunil; Bryant, Christina; Dow, Briony; Dunt, David; Mnatzaganian, George; O039,; Connor, Daniel; Ratcliffe, Julie; Samuel, Sarah; Bagnall, Anne Marie; Doyle, Colleen",Clin Gerontol,103,25

Three categories of samples were used: pre-pandemic, pandemic-RT-PCR-negative and pandemic-RT-PCR-positive. Pre-pandemic sera tested on the Abbott, in-house ELISA, cPASS and Euroimmun S1 protein assays were from healthy volunteers and patients with respiratory infections and/or symptoms (n=113). Pre-pandemic sera tested on the Euroimmun N protein, EDI IgG and Roche assays were archived blood bank sera (n=40). Pandemic samples from patients at Auckland City Hospital and Middlemore Hospital, March to May 2020, were tested on all platforms (n=103), with the exception of the Euroimmun N protein and EDI assays on which only Auckland City Hospital samples were tested (n=90). Due to volume constraints, all pandemic samples were not tested on the Abbott assay. This evaluation demonstrates that the IgG, total antibody (IgG plus IgM) and surrogate viral neutralisation assays are broadly comparable with sensitivities between 77.8-100% and specificities of 94.2-100%. In contrast, the IgA and IgM assays demonstrated poor specificity and sensitivity, respectively. This study presents a local evaluation of nine serological assays, with results specific to the epidemiological context of New Zealand. The IgG, the total antibody and surrogate viral neutralisation assays demonstrated high specificity and reasonable sensitivity. The application of these assays needs to incorporate local laboratory workflow and logistics, with respect to anticipated testing volume. These data support deployment of serological assays in New Zealand for testing high-risk groups to assist contact tracing and public health investigations.","Fox-Lewis, S.; Whitcombe, A.; McGregor, R.; Carlton, L.; Hwang, YuLia Austin P.; Aspin, L.; Raill, B.; Webb, R.; Taylor, S.; Morpeth, S.; Roberts, S.; Moreland, N.

The spectroscopic properties of the chromophores carrying the triplet state have been interpreted on the basis of a delved analysis of the recently solved crystallographic structures of FCP. The results point toward a photoprotective role for two fucoxanthin molecules exposed to the exterior of the FCP monomers. This shows that FCP has adopted a structural strategy different from that of related light-harvesting complexes from plants and other microalgae, in which the photoprotective role is carried out by two highly conserved carotenoids in the interior of the complex.","Agostini, Alessandro; Büchel, Claudia; Di Valentin, Marilena; Carbonera, Donatella",Biochim Biophys Acta Bioenerg,103,23

Many students volunteered to provide clinical support. Volunteering to work in a clinical capacity was a unique medical education opportunity; however, it is unknown whether this was a positive learning experience or which volunteering roles were of most benefit to students. METHODS: The COVIDReady2 study is a national cross-sectional study of all medical students at medical schools in the United Kingdom. The primary outcome is to explore the experiences of medical students who volunteered during the pandemic in comparison to those who did not. We will compare responses to determine the educational benefit and issues they faced. In addition to quantitative analysis, thematic analysis will be used to identify themes in qualitative responses. DISCUSSION: There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that service roles have potential to enhance medical education; yet, there is a shortage of studies able to offer practical advice for how these roles may be incorporated in future medical education. We anticipate that this study will help to identify volunteer structures that have been beneficial for students, so that similar infrastructures can be used in the future, and help inform medical education in a non-pandemic setting.

After a systematic search of the Chinese and English language literature on COVID-19, 75 studies were used to conduct a series of meta-analyses on the relationship of individuals with obesity-COVID-19 over the full spectrum from risk to mortality. A systematic review of the mechanistic pathways for COVID-19 and individuals with obesity is presented. Pooled analysis show individuals with obesity were more at risk for COVID-19 positive, >46.0% higher (OR = 1.46; 95% CI, 1.30-1.65; p < 0.0001); for hospitalization, 113% higher (OR = 2.13; 95% CI, 1.74-2.60; p < 0.0001); for ICU admission, 74% higher (OR = 1.74; 95% CI, 1.46-2.08); and for mortality, 48% increase in deaths (OR = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.22-1.80; p < 0.001). Mechanistic pathways for individuals with obesity are presented in depth for factors linked with COVID-19 risk, severity and their potential for diminished therapeutic and prophylactic treatments among these individuals. Individuals with obesity are linked with large significant increases in morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. There are many mechanisms that jointly explain this impact. A major concern is that vaccines will be less effective for the individuals with obesity.","Popkin, Barry M; Du, Shufa; Green, William D; Beck, Melinda A; Algaith, Taghred; Herbst, Christopher H; Alsukait, Reem F; Alluhidan, Mohammed; Alazemi, Nahar; Shekar, Meera",Obes Rev,103,16

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has generated a lot of controversies whether it is effective in prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Current report presents a 63-year-old woman who has taken HCQ for many years but still infected by COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: A patient with rheumatoid arthritis came to the clinic with fever and sore throat. The patient has been treated with 200 mg HCQ per day since 2016. Laboratory tests showed that the patient had lymphopenia, increased levels of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and serum Interleukin-6 (IL-6). Chest radiography showed that the patient had pneumonia. Throat swab test confirmed COVID-19 positive. On admission, she was treated with nebulized interferon alfa-2b, oral Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and ceftriaxone sodium for the COVID-19 in addition to HCQ. The patient stayed in hospital for 18 days, recovered from oxygen intake, and eventually discharged from hospital. Follow up investigation showed the patient developed antibody against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term application of HCQ could not prevent COVID-19 infection, but whether HCQ exerts benefit to alleviation of clinical symptoms and duration of hospital stays remains to be further investigated.","Zhu, Yin; Chen, Yongping; Gong, Yuewen; Pan, Aijun; Ding, Huijie; Fang, Jianjiang; Yu, Biyun; Wang, Boding; Ke, Chunhai; Xu, Lanman",J Infect Dev Ctries,103,16

During the course of the pandemic, the originally identified SARS-CoV-2 variant has been widely replaced by various mutant versions, which showed enhanced fitness due to increased infection and transmission rates [3, 4]. In order to find an explanation, why SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging mutated versions showed enhanced transfection efficiency as compared to SARS-CoV 2002, an improved binding affinity of the spike protein to human ACE has been proposed by crystal structure analysis and was identified in cell culture models [5-7]. Kinetic analysis of the interaction of various spike protein constructs with the human ACE2 was considered to be best described by a Langmuir based 1:1 stoichiometric interaction. However, we demonstrate in this report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interaction with ACE2 is best described by a two-step interaction, which is defined by an initial binding event followed by a slower secondary rate transition that enhances the stability of the complex by a factor of [~]190 with an overall KD of 0.20 nM. In addition, we show that the secondary rate transition is not only present in SARS-CoV-2 wt but is also found in B.1.1.7 where its transition rate is five-fold increased.","Sevenich, Marc; Heuvel, Joop van den; Gering, Ian; Mohrlueder, Jeannine; Willbold, Dieter",,103,1

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of azithromycin to treat suspected COVID-19 among people in the community who had an increased risk of complications. METHODS: In this UK-based, primary care, open-label, multi-arm, adaptive platform randomised trial of interventions against COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course (PRINCIPLE), we randomly assigned people aged 65 years and older, or 50 years and older with at least one comorbidity, who had been unwell for 14 days or less with suspected COVID-19, to usual care plus azithromycin 500 mg daily for three days, usual care plus other interventions, or usual care alone. The trial had two coprimary endpoints measured within 28 days from randomisation: time to first self-reported recovery, analysed using a Bayesian piecewise exponential, and hospital admission or death related to COVID-19, analysed using a Bayesian logistic regression model. Eligible participants with outcome data were included in the primary analysis, and those who received the allocated treatment were included in the safety analysis. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN86534580. FINDINGS: The first participant was recruited to PRINCIPLE on April 2, 2020. The azithromycin group enrolled participants between May 22 and Nov 30, 2020, by which time 2265 participants had been randomly assigned, 540 to azithromycin plus usual care, 875 to usual care alone, and 850 to other interventions. 2120 (94%) of 2265 participants provided follow-up data and were included in the Bayesian primary analysis, 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group, 823 in the usual care alone group, and 797 in other intervention groups. 402 (80%) of 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group and 631 (77%) of 823 participants in the usual care alone group reported feeling recovered within 28 days. We found little evidence of a meaningful benefit in the azithromycin plus usual care group in time to first reported recovery versus usual care alone (hazard ratio 1·08, 95% Bayesian credibility interval [BCI] 0·95 to 1·23), equating to an estimated benefit in median time to first recovery of 0·94 days (95% BCI -0·56 to 2·43). The probability that there was a clinically meaningful benefit of at least 1·5 days in time to recovery was 0·23. 16 (3%) of 500 participants in the azithromycin plus usual care group and 28 (3%) of 823 participants in the usual care alone group were hospitalised (absolute benefit in percentage 0·3%, 95% BCI -1·7 to 2·2). There were no deaths in either study group. Safety outcomes were similar in both groups. Two (1%) of 455 participants in the azothromycin plus usual care group and four (1%) of 668 participants in the usual care alone group reported admission to hospital during the trial, not related to COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: Our findings do not justify the routine use of azithromycin for reducing time to recovery or risk of hospitalisation for people with suspected COVID-19 in the community. These findings have important antibiotic stewardship implications during this pandemic, as inappropriate use of antibiotics leads to increased antimicrobial resistance, and there is evidence that azithromycin use increased during the pandemic in the UK.

Antenatal ZIKV exposure causes brain anomalies, yet the full spectrum has not been delineated. Objective: To characterize the clinical features of ZIKV infection at a pediatric referral center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, among children with antenatal ZIKV exposure. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study conducted from May to July 2019 of a prospective cohort of 296 infants with antenatal ZIKV exposure followed up since December 2015 at a tertiary maternity-pediatric hospital. Exposures: Zika virus infection during pregnancy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Characterization of clinical features with anthropometric, neurologic, cardiologic, ophthalmologic, audiometric, and neuroimaging evaluations in infancy and neurodevelopmental assessments (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition) from 6 to 42 months of age, stratified by head circumference at birth (head circumference within the reference range, or normocephaly [NC] vs microcephaly [MC]). Results: Antenatal exposure to ZIKV was confirmed for 219 of 296 children (74.0%) referred to Instituto Fernandes Figueira with suspected ZIKV infection through positive maternal or neonatal polymerase chain reaction analysis or IgM serology results. Of these children, 110 (50.2%) were boys, ages ranged from 0 to 4 years, and 53 (24.2%) had congenital microcephaly. The anomalies observed in ZIKV-exposed children with MC or NC were failure to thrive (MC: 38 of 53 [71.7%]; NC: 73 of 143 [51.0%]), cardiac malformations (MC: 19 of 46 [41.3%]; NC: 20 of 100 [20.0%]), excess nuchal skin (MC: 16 of 22 [72.7%]; NC: 35 of 93 [37.6%]), auditory abnormalities (MC: 13 of 50 [26.0%]; NC: 14 of 141 [9.9%]), and eye abnormalities (MC: 42 of 53 [79.2%]; NC: 28 of 158 [17.7%]). Although they experienced fewer neurologic abnormalities than children born with MC, those with NC also had frequent neurologic abnormalities (109 of 160 [68.1%]), including hyperreflexia (36 of 136 [26.5%]), abnormal tone (53 of 137 [38.7%]), congenital neuromotor signs (39 of 93 [41.9%]), feeding difficulties (15 of 143 [10.5%]), and abnormal brain imaging results (44 of 150 [29.3%]). Among 112 children with NC with Bayley-III evaluations, 72 (64.3%) had average or above-average scores; 30 (26.8%) scored 1 SD below average in at least 1 domain; and 10 (8.9%) scored 2 SD below average in at least 1 domain. Among 112 children with NC, a smaller head circumference at birth was significantly associated with subsequent below-average cognitive scores (U = 499.5; z = -2.833; P = .004) and language scores (U = 235.5; z = -2.491; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance: Children without MC who were exposed to ZIKV in utero had a high frequency of anatomical and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. The head circumference at birth for children with NC was associated with neurocognitive development. Recognition of the wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes is critical to ensure early referral to rehabilitative interventions.","Cranston, Jessica S; Tiene, Sophia Finn; Nielsen-Saines, Karin; Vasconcelos, Zilton; Pone, Marcos V; Pone, Sheila; Zin, Andrea; Salles, Tania Saad; Pereira, Jose Paulo; Orofino, Dulce; Brasil, Patricia; Kerin, Tara; Adachi, Kristina; Soares, Fernanda Mendes; Dunshee de Abranches, Andrea; da Costa, Ana Carolina C; Lopes Moreira, Maria Elisabeth",JAMA Netw Open,103,16

AREAS COVERED: While Asian countries started using masks early during the epidemic, most Western countries were slow to do so. To avoid such situations, clear guidelines, need to be established, not only regarding the use of masks but also the type of mask to suit different situations. In this article, we will examine the types of masks and review the recommendations for their use based on the available evidence for each type of mask. EXPERT OPINION: We explore future needs in research-related mask use in COVID-19 pandemic, improvements to be made in mask design, adopting guidelines for the use of masks and the psycho-social aspects of widespread and prolonged mask use.","De Silva, Arjuna P; Niriella, Madunil A; de Silva, H Janaka",Expert Rev Respir Med,103,16

Physical distancing measures, for instance, may affect sexual health, impacting access to HIV prevention supplies and changing sexual behaviour, as well as mental health, increasing feelings of unsafety and weakening community support ties. These effects can be worsened among socially marginalised groups, such as men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW). Brazil is among the countries most affected by COVID-19 in the world, where control measures have been inconsistently implemented. We aim to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sexual and mental health of adolescent and adult MSM and TGW in Brazil. METHODS: Convergent mixed-method prospective cohort study, nested in two ongoing HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) cohorts in Brazil, named PrEP1519 and Combina. Participants will be invited to answer, at baseline and after 6 months, a questionnaire about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual behaviour, HIV prevention and mental health. Data on HIV infection and sexually transmitted infections (STI) will be collected as part of routine follow-up from the cohorts. Main outcome measures (HIV infection, STI and depression symptoms) will be observed within 12 months after baseline. Sample size is estimated at 426 participants. Complementarily, 50 participants will be invited to in-depth interviews through video calls or interactive voice response, and 20 will be invited to chronicle their lives during the pandemic through digital diaries. Triangulation will be done across qualitative methods and with the quantitative data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by Research Ethics Committees from the Brazilian Universities coordinating the study. Findings will be published in scientific journals and presented at meetings. Informative flyers will be elaborated to communicate study findings to participants and key stakeholders.","Ferraz, Dulce; Dourado, Inês; Zucchi, Eliana Miura; Mabire, Xavier; Magno, Laio; Grangeiro, Alexandre D; Couto, Márcia Thereza; Ferguson, Laura; Westin, Mateus; Alves Dos Santos, Lorruan; Préau, Marie",BMJ Open,103,10

For non-severe COVID-19 patients affected by neurovascular diseases, the prevalence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is unknown. The aim of our study was to report data obtained after systematic Doppler ultrasound scanning (DUS) of lower limbs in such patients. METHODS: Between March 20 and May 2, 2020, the deep venous system of 13 consecutive patients diagnosed with neurovascular diseases and non-severe COVID-19 was investigated with a systematic bedside DUS. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled in the study including 9 acute ischaemic strokes, 1 occlusion of the ophthalmic artery, 1 transient ischaemic attack, 1 cerebral venous thrombosis and 1 haemorrhagic stroke. On admission, the median National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was of 6 (IQR, 0-20). During the first week after admission, and despite thromboprophylaxis, we found a prevalence of 38.5% of asymptomatic calves' DVT (n = 5). One patient developed a symptomatic pulmonary embolism and 2 other patients died during hospitalization. The outcome was positive for the other patients with a discharge median NIHSS score of 1 (IQR, 0-11). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Despite thromboprophylaxis, systematic bedside DUS showed a high prevalence (38.5%) of asymptomatic DVT in non-severe COVID-19 patients suffering from a neurovascular disease. In the absence of a reliable marker of DVT, we suggest that this non-invasive investigation could be an interesting tool to monitor peripheral venous thrombotic complications in such patients.","Rouyer, Olivier; Pierre-Paul, Irène Nora; Balde, Amadou Talibe; Jupiter, Damaris; Bindila, Daniela; Geny, Bernard; Wolff, Valérie",Cerebrovasc Dis Extra,103,21

The World Health Organization published a guideline as a way of supporting mental health and psychosocial well-being of different groups during this pandemic. The impact of the pandemic has pushed governments to put measures in place to curb not only the physical health of individuals but their mental health and psychosocial well-being as well. The aim of our paper was to review mental health guidelines of some Sub Saharan African (SSA) countries: (i) to assess their appropriateness for the immediate mental health needs at this time, (ii) to form as a basis for ongoing reflection as the current pandemic evolves. Guidelines were retrieved openly from internet search and some were requested from mental health practitioners in various SSA countries. The authors designed a semi structured questionnaire, as a self-interview guide to gain insight on the experience of COVID-19 from experts in the mental health sector in the various countries. While we used a document analysis approach to analyze the data, we made use of the Mental Health Preparedness and Action Framework to discuss our findings. We received health or mental health guidelines from 10 SSA countries. Cameroon, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda all had mental health guidelines or mental health component in their health guidelines. Our experts highlight that the mental health needs of the people are of concern during this pandemic but have not been given priority. They go further to suggest that the mental health needs are slightly different during this time and requiring a different approach especially considering the measures taken to curb the spread of disease. We conclude that despite the provision of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support guidelines, gaps still exist making them inadequate to meet the mental health needs of their communities.","Molebatsi, K.; Musindo, O.; Ntlantsana, V.; Wambua, G.

Although the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are dominated by respiratory symptoms, some patients present other severe damage such as cardiovascular, renal and liver injury or/and multiple organ failure, suggesting a spread of the SARS-CoV-2 in blood. Recent ultrasensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology now allows absolute quantification of nucleic acids in plasma. We herein intended to use the droplet-based digital PCR technology to obtain sensitive detection and precise quantification of plasma SARS-CoV-2 viral load (SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Fifty-eight consecutive COVID-19 patients with pneumonia 8 to 12 days after onset of symptoms and 12 healthy controls were analyzed. Disease severity was categorized as mild-to-moderate in 17 patients, severe in 16 patients and critical in 26 patients. Plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia was quantified by droplet digital Crystal Digital PCR&#8482; next-generation technology (Stilla Technologies, Villejuif, France). RESULTS: Overall, SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia was detected in 43 (74.1%) patients. Prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia correlated with disease severity, ranging from 53% in mild-to-moderate patients to 88% in critically ill patients (p=0.036). Levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia were associated with severity (p=0.035). Among nine patients who experienced clinical deterioration during follow-up, eight had positive SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia at baseline while only one critical patient with undetectable SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia at the time of analysis died at day 27. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 RNAaemia measured by droplet-based digital PCR constitutes a promising prognosis biomarker in COVID-19 patients.","Veyer, David; Kernéis, Solen; Poulet, Geoffroy; Wack, Maxime; Robillard, Nicolas; Taly, Valérie; L039,; Honneur, Anne-Sophie; Rozenberg, Flore; Laurent-Puig, Pierre; Bélec, Laurent; Hadjadj, Jérôme; Terrier, Benjamin; Péré, Hélène",Clin. infect. dis,103,24

The formula is in terms of the fraction of positive test results and test parameters, i.e., probability of true positives (sensitivity) and the probability of true negatives (specificity). The motivation of this work arises in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in which estimating the number of infected individuals depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the tests. In this context, it is shown that approximating the prevalence ratio by the ratio between the number of positive tests and the total number of tested individuals leads to dramatically high estimation errors, and thus, unadapted public health policies. The relevance of estimating the prevalence ratio using the formula presented in this work is that precision increases with the number of tests. Two conclusions are drawn from this work. First, in order to ensure that a reliable estimation is achieved with a finite number of tests, testing campaigns must be implemented with tests for which the sum of the sensitivity and the specificity is sufficiently different than one. Second, the key parameter for reducing the estimation error is the number of tests. For a large number of tests, as long as the sum of the sensitivity and specificity is different than one, the exact values of these parameters have very little impact on the estimation error.","Altman, Eitan; Mounir, Izza; Najid, Fatim-Zahra; Perlaza, Samir M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),103,1

The aim of this meta-analysis was to combine the results of clinical studies of different designs to investigate the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in severely-to-critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Scopus, and preprint servers up to 26 December 2020. Since a substantial heterogeneity was expected, a random-effects model was applied to calculate the pooled effect size (ES) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each study outcome. RESULTS: Forty-five comparative studies involving 13,189 patients and 28 single-arm studies involving 1,770 patients were analyzed. The risk of mortality (RR of 0.76 [95%CI 0.65 to 0.89], P < 0.01) and intubation (RR of 0.48 [95%CI 0.24 to 0.97], P = 0.04) were lower in tocilizumab patients compared with controls. We did not find any significant difference in secondary infections, length of hospital stay, hospital discharge before day 14, and ICU admission between groups. CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab can improve clinical outcomes and reduce mortality rates in severe to critical COVID-19 patients.

Unfortunately, false negative test results are often reported. In this study, we attempted to determine the principal causes leading to false negative results of RT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in respiratory tract specimens. Multiple sputum and throat swab specimens from 161 confirmed COVID-19 patients were tested with a commercial fluorescent RT-PCR kit targeting the ORF1ab and N regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome. The RNA level of a cellular housekeeping gene ribonuclease P/MRP subunit p30 (RPP30) in these specimens was also assessed by RT-PCR. Data for a total of 1052 samples were retrospectively re-analyzed and a strong association between positive results in SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests and high level of RPP30 RNA in respiratory tract specimens was revealed. By using the ROC-AUC analysis, we identified Ct cutoff values for RPP30 RT-PCR which predicted false negative results for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR with high sensitivity (95.03%-95.26%) and specificity (83.72%-98.55%) for respective combination of specimen type and amplification reaction. Using these Ct cutoff values, false negative results could be reliably identified. Therefore, the presence of cellular materials, likely infected host cells, are essential for correct SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by RT-PCR in patient specimens. RPP30 could serve as an indicator for cellular content, or a surrogate indicator for specimen quality. In addition, our results demonstrated that false negativity accounted for a vast majority of contradicting results in SARS-CoV-2 RNA test by RT-PCR.","Zhang, Yafei; Wang, Changtai; Han, Mingfeng; Ye, Jun; Gao, Yong; Liu, Zhongping; He, Tengfei; Li, Tuantuan; Xu, Mengyuan; Zhou, Luping; Zou, Guizhou; Lu, Mengji; Zhang, Zhenhua",Virol Sin,103,2

There are currently no data regarding aerosol generation during this procedure. Given the ongoing debate regarding the potential for aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, we aimed to quantify and characterize aerosol generation during peak flow testing. METHODS: Five healthy volunteers performed peak flow maneuvers in a particle-free laboratory space. Two devices continuously sampled the ambient air during the procedure. One device can detect ultrafine particles 0.02-1 µm in diameter, while the second device can detect particles 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10 µm in diameter. Five different peak flow meters were compared to ambient baseline during masked and unmasked tidal breathing. RESULTS: Ultrafine particles (0.02-1 µm) were generated during peak flow measurement. There was no significant difference in ultrafine particle mean concentration between peak flow meters (P = .23): Respironics (1.25 ± 0.47 particles/mL), Philips (3.06 ± 1.22), Clement Clarke (3.55 ± 1.22 particles/mL), Respironics Low Range (3.50 ± 1.52 particles/mL), and Monaghan (3.78 ± 1.31 particles/mL). Ultrafine particle mean concentration with peak flow testing was significantly higher than masked (0.22 ± 0.29 particles/mL) and unmasked tidal breathing (0.15 ± 0.18 particles/mL, P = .01), but the ultrafine particle concentrations were small compared to ambient particle concentrations in a pulmonary function testing room (89.9 ± 8.95 particles/mL). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, aerosol generation was present during peak flow testing, but concentrations were small compared to the background particle concentration in the ambient clinical environment. Surgical masks and eye protection are likely sufficient infection control measures during peak expiratory flow testing in asymptomatic patients with well controlled respiratory symptoms, but COVID-19 testing remains prudent in patients with acute respiratory symptoms prior to evaluation and peak expiratory flow assessment while the community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 cases remains high.","Subat, Yosuf W; Guntupalli, Siva Kamal; Sajgalik, Pavol; Hainy, Matthew E; Torgerud, Keith D; Helgeson, Scott A; Johnson, Bruce D; Allison, Thomas G; Lim, Kaiser G; Niven, Alexander S",Respir. care,103,16

Sarcopenia is an age-related disorder that increases hospitalization, dependencies, and mortality in older adults. It starts to develop in midlife or even earlier as a result of unbalanced diet/poor nutrition and low levels of physical activity, in addition to chronic disorders such as obesity and diabetes mellitus. Given that social isolation is adopted as the most protective measure against COVID-19, the level of physical activity and the intake of adequate diet have considerably declined, especially among older adults—denoting an increased possibility for developing sarcopenia. Research also shows a higher vulnerability of sarcopenic people to COVID-19 as well as the development of wasting disorders such as sarcopenia and cachexia in a considerable proportion of symptomatic and recovering COVID-19 patients. Muscular wasting in COVID-19 is associated with poor prognosis. Accordingly, early detection and proper management of sarcopenia and wasting conditions in older adults and COVID-19 patients may minimize morbidity and mortality during the current COVID-19 crisis. This review explored different aspects of screening for sarcopenia, stressing their relevance to the detection of altered muscular structure and performance in patients with COVID-19. Current guidelines recommend prior evaluation of muscle strength by simple measures such as grip strength to identify individuals with proven weakness who then would be screened for muscle mass loss. The latter is best measured by MRI and CT. However, due to the high cost and radiation risk entailed by these techniques, other simpler and cheaper techniques such as DXA and ultrasound are given preference. Muscle loss in COVID-19 patients was measured during the acute phase by CT scanning of the pectoralis muscle simultaneously during a routine check for lung fibrosis, which seems to be an efficient evaluation of sarcopenia among those patients with no additional cost. In recovering patients, muscle strength and physical performance have been evaluated by electromyography and traditional tests such as the six-minute walk test. Effective preventive and therapeutic interventions are necessary in order to prevent muscle loss and associated physical decline in COVID-19 patients.

However, most early warning systems are centralized and isolated, thus there are potential risks of single evidence bias and decision-making errors. In this paper, we tackle this issue via proposing a novel framework of collaborative early warning for COVID-19 based on blockchain and smart contracts, aiming to crowdsource early warning tasks to distributed channels including medical institutions, social organinzations, and even individuals. Our framework supports two surveillance modes, namely, medical federation surveillance based on federated learning and social collaboration surveillance based on the learning markets approach, and fuses their monitoring results on emerging cases to alert. By using our framework, medical institutions are expected to obtain better federated surveillance models with privacy protection, and social participants without mutual trusts can also share verified surveillance resources such as data and models, and fuse their surveillance solutions. We implemented our proposed framework based on the Ethereum and IPFS platforms. Experimental results show that our framework has advantages of decentralized decision-making, fairness, auditability, and universality, and also has potential guidance and reference value for the early warning and prevention of unknown infectious diseases.","Ouyang, Liwei; Yuan, Yong; Cao, Yumeng; Wang, Fei-Yue",Information sciences,103,33

Identity politics around ‘race’ is used to legitimise ‘expressive’ or reprisal-oriented violence against ‘Hamitic’ or ‘Tutsi’ minorities. The case of the Banyamulenge of South Kivu is examined in this article. Following Autesserre, we show that one-dimensional narratives – in this case of ‘race’ – tend to over-simplify the dynamics of political violence. Anti-Hamitic racism is derived from colonial ideas around race hierarchies, and has resulted in systematic killings of Banyamulenge civilians in what resembles a ‘slow genocide’. Expressive violence has, in turn, produced a lack of concern for the plight of Banyamulenge civilians among the military, humanitarians, media, scholars and NGOs. Given armed alliances between local Maimai forces, Burundian and Rwandan opposition and the DRC army, such ‘race’ narratives cruelly legitimise violence against civilians from ‘Tutsi’ communities, associated by neighbouring communities with Rwanda. Resultant displacement, starvation and killing of Banyamulenge civilians in this context amount to an on-going, slow-moving genocide. As the COVID-19 crisis unrolls, the decolonisation of identity politics in Eastern DRC, and in South Kivu in particular still seems very remote.

Increased loneliness and social isolation are associated with adverse health outcomes, yet there is a gap in brief interventions that specifically target loneliness. This article introduces a brief intervention to strengthen connectedness, LOVE. In a systematic way, this solution-focused approach encourages openness and sharing of current struggles with the existing circle of support. There are four steps in LOVE: List people in one's life, Organise them on the helpfulness-availability matrix, Verify what they know to map them onto circles of trust and Engage them through self-disclosure. CONCLUSION: The article details each concept, its importance, the pragmatics involved and top tips to guide practice. The memorable acronym provides logical sequence and structure. It is time efficient in training and delivery, with no former mental health knowledge required so there is potential for wide application. It facilitates collaboration between health professionals and people in distress and promotes empowerment and self-resilience. Adapted from the safety planning component of PROTECT, a pre-existing suicide prevention framework, LOVE has to be fine-tuned as a brief intervention in the wider context of the pandemic.","Kar Ray, Manaan; Chow, Ka Ki; Theodoros, Theo; Wyder, Marianne; Steginga, Anne; Sorrensen, Rosemary; Hickey, Paul; Lau, Geoff; Kinsella, Kieran; Lombardo, Chiara",Australas Psychiatry,103,24

Early into the pandemic, reports of CoV-2 diagnoses in pets and other animals emerged, including dogs, cats, farmed mink and some large felids (tigers and lions) from various countries. While most CoV-2 positive animals were confirmed to have been in close contact with CoV-2 positive humans, there has been a paucity of published evidence to-date describing risk factors associated with CoV-2 transmission among humans and domestic and wild animals. The COVID-19 Human-Animal Interactions Survey (CHAIS) was developed through a cross-CEIRS Center collaboration to provide a standardized survey describing human-animal interaction during the pandemic and to evaluate behavioral, spatiotemporal, and biological risk factors associated with bi-directional zoonotic transmission of CoV-2 within households and other shared environments. CHAIS measures four broad domains of transmission risk; 1) intensity and risk of infection among human hosts, 2) spatial characteristics of shared environments, 3) behaviors and human-animal interactions, and 4) animal susceptibility to infection and propensity for onward spread. Following the development of CHAIS, with a One Health approach, a multidisciplinary group of experts (n=20) was invited to review and provide feedback on the survey for content validity. Expert feedback was incorporated into two final survey formats-a long-form and an abridged version for which specific core questions addressing zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmission were identified. Both forms are modularized, with each section having the capacity to serve as independent instruments, allowing researchers to customize the survey based on context and research-specific needs. Further adaptations for studies seeking to investigate other zoonotic pathogens with similar routes of transmission (i.e. respiratory, direct contact) are also possible. The CHAIS instrument is a standardized human-animal interaction survey developed to provide important data on risk factors that guide transmission of CoV-2 from humans to animals, with great utility in capturing information of zoonotic transmission risk factors for CoV-2 and other similar pathogens. ImpactsO_LIWe present a standardized survey instrument for evaluating risk factors associated with bi-directional zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other similarly transmitted pathogens in household and other settings where humans and animals share close contact. C_LIO_LIThe CHAIS instrument evaluates behavioral, spatiotemporal, and host determinants of transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 and is highly adaptable for use in studies seeking to investigate other zoonotic pathogens such as influenza viruses.

In the present study, we aimed to develop a real-time RT-PCR method for detection of BVDV-1 in aerosol samples. METHODS: A pair of primers specific for highly conserved regions of the BVDV-1 5'-UTR was designed. The standard curve and sensitivity of the developed assay were assessed based on 10-fold serial dilutions of RNA molecular standard. The specificity of the assay was evaluated with other pestiviruses and infectious bovine viruses. The clinical performance was examined by testing 169 aerosol samples. RESULTS: The results showed that a good linear relationship existed between the standard curve and the concentration of template. The lowest detection limit was 5.2 RNA molecules per reaction. This assay was specific for detection of BVDV-1, and no amplification was found for other pestiviruses such as classical swine fever virus (CSFV), border disease virus (BDV), and common infectious bovine viruses, including BVDV-2, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV), bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV-3), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) and bovine coronavirus (BcoV). The assay was highly reproducible with low variation coefficient values (CVs) for intra-assay and inter-assay. A total of 169 aerosol samples collected from six dairy herds were tested using this method. The results showed that the positive detection rate of BVDV-1 was 17.2% (29/169), which was significantly higher compared with the conventional RT-PCR. Additionally, the positive samples (n = 29) detected by real-time RT-PCR were verified by BVDV RPA-LFD, and a concordance rate of 100% was obtained between them. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we developed a real-time RT-PCR assay for quantitative analysis of BVDV-1 in aerosol samples, and our finding provided valuable insights into the risk on aerosol transmission of BVDV-1.","Hou, Peili; Xu, Yaru; Wang, Hongmei; He, Hongbin",BMC Vet Res,103,21

METHODS: Peripheral blood samples of the child and his parents were collected for the extraction of genomic DNA. The 5 exons and exon/intronic boundaries of the CD40L gene were subjected to PCR amplification and sequencing. Suspected variants were analyzed by using bioinformatic software. The JCV gene was amplified from genomic DNA by nested PCR and sequenced. RESULTS: The child was found to harbor a hemizygous c.506 A>C (p.Y169S) missense variant in exon 5 of the CD40L gene. The variant may affect the TNFH domain of the CD40L protein and result in structural instability and loss of hydrophobic interaction between CD40L and CD40. As predicted by PolyPhen2 and SIFT software, the variant was probably damaging (score = 1.00) and deleterious (score= -8.868). His mother was found to be a heterozygous carrier, while the same variant was not found in his father. Gel electrophoresis of the nested PCR product revealed presence of target JCV band, which was confirmed to be 99% identical with the JCV gene by sequencing. CONCLUSION: The patient was diagnosed with co-commitment XHIGM and PML based on the testing of the CD40L gene and JCV infection.","Li, Dongjun; Li, Qiang",Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,103,21

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Henry Ford Health System Multidisciplinary ICU, a total of 156 beds spread throughout the hospital in Detroit, MI. PATIENTS: We obtained data from the electronic medical record of all adult severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2-positive patients managed in the ICU of Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, MI, between March 13, 2020, and July 31, 2020. Included patients were divided into two groups: people of color (including Black, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, and Arab) and White. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 365 patients were evaluated: 219 were Black (60.0%), 129 were White (35.3%), two were Asian (0.6%), eight were Hispanic/Latino (2.2%), and seven were Arab (1.9%). People of color were younger (62.8 vs 67.1; p = 0.007), with equal distribution of sex. People of color had less coronary artery disease (34 [14.4%] vs 35 [27.1%]; p =0.003) and less self-reported use of regular alcohol consumption (50 [21.2%] vs 12 [9.3%]; p = 0.004) than Whites, with no differences in diabetes (125 [53.0%] vs 66 [51.2%]; p = 0.742), hypertension (188 [79.7%] vs 99 [76.8%]; p = 0.516), congestive heart failure (41 [17.4%] vs 32 [24.8%]; p = 0.090), or chronic kidney disease (123 [54.1%] vs 55 [42.6%]; p = 0.083).There was no difference in ICU length of stay between people of color (18 d [CI, 7-47 d]) and Whites (18 d [CI, 6-48 d]; p = 0. 0.979). Neither frequency (72.5% vs 71.3%; p = ns) nor median time to mechanical ventilation between people of color (9 d [CI, 6-15 d]) and Whites (10 d [CI, 5-16 d]; p = 0.733) was different. Overall, 188 patients (51.5 %) died in the hospital. The 28-day mortality was lower in people of color (107/236; 45.3%) versus Whites (73/129; 56.6%) (adjusted odds ratio 0.60; p = 0.034), and there was an increased median survival time in people of color (20 d) versus Whites (13.5 d; hazard ratio 0.62; p = 0.002). The inhospital mortality was lower in people of color versus White, but the difference was not statistically significant (113 [47.9%] vs 75 [58.1%], respectively; p = 0.061). Finally, there was no significant difference in days of symptoms prior to admission, frequency of presenting symptoms, or frequency or severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019, people of color had a lower 28-day mortality than Whites with no difference in hospital mortality, ICU length of stay, or rates of intubation.

Some countries proposed universal mask wearing as a protection measure of public health to strengthen national prevention efforts and to limit the wider spread of the epidemic. In order to reveal the epidemic prevention efficacy of masks, this paper systematically evaluates the experimental studies of various masks and filter materials, summarises the general characteristics of the filtration efficiency of isolation masks with particle size, and reveals the actual efficacy of masks by combining the volume distribution characteristics of human exhaled droplets with different particle sizes and the SARS-CoV-2 virus load of nasopharynx and throat swabs from patients. The existing measured data show that the filtration efficiency of all kinds of masks for large particles and extra-large droplets is close to 100%. From the perspective of filtering the total number of pathogens discharged in the environment and protecting vulnerable individuals from breathing live viruses, the mask has a higher protective effect. If considering the weighted average filtration efficiency with different particle sizes, the filtration efficiencies of the N95 mask and the ordinary mask are 99.4% and 98.5%, respectively. The mask can avoid releasing active viruses to the environment from the source of infection, thus maximising the protection of vulnerable individuals by reducing the probability of inhaling a virus. Therefore, if the whole society strictly implements the policy of publicly wearing masks, the risk of large-scale spread of the epidemic can be greatly reduced. Compared with the overall cost of social isolation, limited personal freedoms and forced suspension of economic activities, the inconvenience for citizens caused by wearing masks is perfectly acceptable.","Wei, Jincheng; Guo, Shurui; Long, Enshen; Zhang, Li; Shu, Bizhen; Guo, Lei",Epidemiol Infect,103,33

This strategy allowed for a feasible, swift and dynamic expansion of ED capacity without the need for external tent facilities. This report details on the technical execution and discusses the pearls and potential pitfalls of this expansion strategy.

COMPARISON BETWEEN COVID AND NON-COVID PNEUMONIA,14.583111,9.718612,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the various psychosocial factors associated with reverse migration among migrant workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown in India. METHODS: A cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted at 4 sites in Northwest India. The migrant workers were recruited from various shelter homes, and information was gathered from reverse migrant workers and controls using various tools including a sociodemographic profile; knowledge, attitudes, and practices questionnaire; and reasons for migration and reverse migration questionnaires. A total of 275 reverse migrant workers and 276 controls participated in the study. RESULTS: There was a considerable difference between reverse migrant workers and controls regarding the question of whether it was safe to travel during lockdown (76.0% vs 26.4%, respectively). The most common route of spread of COVID-19 infection was through touching and sneezing, and symptoms were fever, dry cough, and sore throat in both groups. Reverse migrant workers had low self-esteem and were reluctant to participate in customs of their migration city. A large number of reverse migrant workers reported that they had no money to survive, worried about family back home at their village, felt pressured by family members to come back to the village, and had been terminated from their job. CONCLUSIONS: Reverse migrant workers had the attitude that it was safe to travel during the lockdown. About one-fifth of the reverse migrant workers reported no place to live and fear of getting an infection. The reverse migrant workers also reported feeling low and gloomy, restless, and uncertain about the future and fear of death. Lack of jobs was a major factor driving migrant workers from their native homes.","Chavan, B S; Sidana, Ajeet; Arun, Priti; Rohilla, Ravi; Singh, Gurvinder Pal; Solanki, R K; Aneja, Jitender; Murara, Mankirat Kaur; Verma, Madhur; Chakraborty, Saikat; Singh, Chitra; Sharma, Himanshu; Sharma, Raviprakash; Bahri, Sanjay; Bhanwra, Dushant",Prim. care companion CNS disord.

Antibody testing has been used to identify staff members who have been previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, and has been rolled out rapidly in the United Kingdom. a number of published comment and editorial articles raising concerns about antibody testing in this context. We present perceptions of NHS healthcare workers in relation to SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. METHODS: Electronic survey regarding perceptions towards SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing which was distributed to all healthcare workers at a major NHS tertiary hospital following implementation of antibody testing. RESULTS: In total, 560 healthcare workers completed the survey (80% female; 25% of BAME background; 58% from frontline clinical staff). Exploring whether they previously had COVID-19 was the primary reported reason for choosing to undergo antibody testing (85.2%). In case of a positive antibody test, 72% reported that they would feel relieved, whilst 48% felt that they would be happier to work in a patient-facing area. Moreover, 12% responded that a positive test would mean ""social distancing is less important"", with 34% of the responders indicating that in this case they would be both less likely to catch COVID-19 and happier to visit friends/relatives. CONCLUSIONS: NHS staff members primarily seek out SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing for an appropriate reason. Based on our findings and given the lack of definite data regarding the extent of immunity protection from a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody test, significant concerns may be raised regarding the reported interpretation by healthcare workers of positive antibody test results.

Transient non-severe increased insulin requirement in patients hospitalized for medical conditions such as sepsis or myocardial infarction is a well-known phenomenon. However, extremely high-dose insulin requirement remains a very rarely reported entity. Here, we report the case of an extreme and transitory insulin requirement episode in a type 2 diabetic patient presenting an acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old man resident in Geneva, Switzerland, previously known for type 2 diabetes for 3 years was admitted for an aggravation of his dyspnea. His type 2 diabetes was treated only with metformin and his latest Hb1Ac was 6.1%. Chest CT SCAN showed a bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification. Twenty-four hours after his admission he presented a worsening of dyspnea and severe hypoxemia requiring a transfer to the intensive care unit rapidly followed by oro-tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation support. A bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and test of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR assay was positive. At day 3, he presented a rapidly progressive insulin requirement at a rate of up to 50 units/hour intravenous insulin aspart. Despite the high insulin doses, he maintained an elevated plasma glucose level at 270 mg/dL on average. His extremely high-dose insulin requirement ""resolved"" at day 9, and the insulin infusion rate was rapidly reduced. CONCLUSIONS: This case may reflect a specific and profound impact of SARS-CoV-2 on metabolic homeostasis, in particular in diabetic patients that appear more prone to complications of COVID-19 infection. Yet, the mechanisms behind this remain to be elucidated. The optimal management of hyperglycemia of diabetic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has yet not be defined, however insulin remain the mainstay of treatment approach. Report of extreme dysregulation of chronic conditions such as diabetes in patients with COVID-19 may help clinicians to better take care of patients during the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2. To the best of our knowledge this is the first description of extremely high-dose insulin requirement in patient with COVID-19.","Jornayvaz, François R; Assouline, Benjamin; Pugin, Jérôme; Gariani, Karim",BMC Endocr Disord,103,16

In April 2020, the nation was shocked by the death by suicide of New York City emergency physician Dr. Lorna Breen, who died while recovering from COVID-19. She joins an unknown number of clinicians who have taken their lives over the past year. The authors introduce Dr. Breen, a highly talented physician working on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, and examine how pervasive distress and suicide are in clinicians. Then they explain the lived experience movement and highlight how clinicians speaking openly about their mental illness and treatment are making it easier for their colleagues to seek lifesaving help, despite the stigma still surrounding mental illness and treatment in medicine. The authors sort through the science of clinician distress, critique how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the lives of clinicians, and describe existing national initiatives to address clinician stress, burnout, and suicide. Finally, they recommend evidence-based actions to prevent clinician suicide that multiple stakeholder groups can take, including regulatory agencies, licensing boards, and hospital privileging boards; specialty boards, professional associations, and continuing education organizations; medical educators; and individual clinicians. Suicide is a complex but generally preventable cause of death. Those in medicine must forge ahead with collective momentum. Dr. Breen, so many other clinicians, and those they have left behind deserve nothing less.","Moutier, Christine Yu; Myers, Michael F; Feist, Jennifer Breen; Feist, J Corey; Zisook, Sidney",Acad. med,103,2

However, the epidemiology, management, and associated outcomes have varied greatly between studies. The pathophysiology remains unclear. Summary: The etiology of AKI in the setting of COVID-19 appears multifactorial. Systemic effects of sepsis, inflammation, and vascular injury likely play some role. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, highly expressed in the kidney, providing a route for direct infection. Older age, baseline comorbidities, and respiratory failure are strong risk factors for the development of AKI. Regardless of etiology, AKI carries a significantly increased risk for in-hospital mortality, especially in those with critical illness. Currently, management of AKI in patients with COVID-19 remains supportive. Key Messages: AKI is common in patients with COVID-19. Future studies are needed to examine the response to anti-viral treatment as well as long-term renal outcomes in patients with AKI.","Lynch, Matthew R; Tang, Jie",R I Med J (2013),103,24

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: All CCP data from our first day of collection on March 26th through July 7th, 2020 are included in this retrospective analysis. Donor and donation data were extracted from NYBC electronic databases. SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing was initially performed by the NY State Department of Health, and later by NYBC using Ortho and Abbott platforms. RESULTS: CCP donor age and ABO distributions were consistent with reported lower COVID-19 susceptibility in O blood types. CCP versus whole blood donors had similar on-site deferrals, but higher post-donation deferral rates. CCP versus routine plasmapheresis donations had higher vasovagal reactions but similar product rejection rates. Changes in antibody (Ab) test platforms resulted in significant changes in the percent of donors regarded as antibody positive. Donor correlates with higher anti-spike total Ig S/CO ratios were Hispanic ethnicity, overweight body mass index, and longer symptom duration; and with higher anti-nucleocapsid IgG S/CO ratios were male gender, older age, Hispanic ethnicity, and fewer days between symptom onset and first donation. DISCUSSION: We identify donor characteristics not previously reported to correlate with Ab titer. Our analysis should assist with donor outreach strategies, blood center operating logistics, and recruitment of high titer donors.","Jain, Saagar; Garg, Keshav; Tran, Sabrina M; Rask, Isabel L; Tarczon, Michael; Nandi, Vijay; Kessler, Debra A; Strauss, Donna; Sachais, Bruce S; Yazdanbakhsh, Karina; Rehmani, Shiraz; Luchsinger, Larry; Shi, Patricia A",Transfusion,103,16

Comorbidities such as chronic degenerative diseases are frequently associated with complications in COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate inflammatory and procoagulant biomarkers in COVID-19 patients from a public hospital in Mexico. Blood was sampled within the first 48 h after admission in 119 confirmed COVID-19 patients that were classified in 3 groups according to oxygen demand, evolution and the severity of the disease as follows: 1) Non severe: nasal cannula or oxygen mask; 2) Severe: high flow nasal cannula and 3) Death: mechanical ventilation eventually leading to fatal outcome. Blood samples from 20 healthy donors were included as a Control Group. Analysis of inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers including D-dimer, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, PAI-1, P-selectin and VWF was performed in plasma. Routine laboratory and clinical biomarkers were also included and compared among groups. Concentrations of D-dimer (14.5 ± 13.8 µg/ml) and PAI-1 (1223 ± 889.6 ng/ml) were significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 patients (P < 0.0001).

Computer-generated scaffolds were either built around an ACE2 helix that interacts with the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) or docked against the RBD to identify new binding modes, and their amino acid sequences were designed to optimize target binding, folding, and stability. Ten designs bound the RBD, with affinities ranging from 100 picomolar to 10 nanomolar, and blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells with median inhibitory concentration (IC50) values between 24 picomolar and 35 nanomolar. The most potent, with new binding modes, are 56- and 64-residue proteins (IC50 ~ 0.16 nanograms per milliliter). Cryo-electron microscopy structures of these minibinders in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain trimer with all three RBDs bound are nearly identical to the computational models. These hyperstable minibinders provide starting points for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.","Cao, Longxing; Goreshnik, Inna; Coventry, Brian; Case, James Brett; Miller, Lauren; Kozodoy, Lisa; Chen, Rita E; Carter, Lauren; Walls, Alexandra C; Park, Young-Jun; Strauch, Eva-Maria; Stewart, Lance; Diamond, Michael S; Veesler, David; Baker, David",Science,103,30

Cuvier, 1798) is considered one of the less known Neotropical carnivore species. In the present study we analyzed the diet of P. cancrivorus in a peat forest and in an estuarine island in southernmost Brazil. Fruits of the gerivá palm tree Syagrus romanzoffiana were the most consumed item in the peat forest, followed by insects and mollusks. Small mammals, followed by Bromelia antiacantha (Bromeliaceae) fruits and brachyuran crustaceans were the most frequent items in the estuarine island. Other items found in lower frequencies were Solanum sp., Psidium sp., Smilax sp. and Dyospiros sp. fruits, diplopods, scorpions, fishes, anuran amphibians, reptiles (black tegu lizard and snakes), birds and medium-sized mammals (white-eared opossum, armadillo and coypu). Levins index values (peat forest: 0.38; estuarine island: 0.45) indicate an approximation to a median position between a specialist and a well distributed diet. Piankas index (0.80) showed a considerable diet similarity between the two systems. Procyon cancrivorus presented a varied diet in the studied areas and may play an important role as seed disperser on coastal environments in southernmost Brazil.(AU)","Quintela, Fernando M; Iob, Graziela; Artioli, Luiz G S",Iheringia.

We then convened regular meetings with clinic leadership and frontline providers to receive feedback and implement new practices. These rapid meeting cycles allowed for a nimble response to a changing landscape. We optimised our video-conferencing and telehealth services, reached out to our most vulnerable patients and engaged other providers and medical students who were not engaged in patient care due to social isolation practices.

METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured with the Elecsys® assay and the EDITM ELISAs (IgM and IgG) in 64 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients with serial blood samples (n = 104) collected at different time points from symptom onset. Blood samples from 200 healthy blood donors and 256 intensive care unit (ICU) patients collected before the COVID-19 outbreak were also used. RESULTS: In COVID-19 patients, the percentage of positive results rose with time from symptom onset, peaking to positivity rates after 15-22 days of 100% for the Elecsys® assay, of 94% for the EDITM IgM-ELISA and of 100% for the EDITM IgG ELISA. In the 104 blood samples, the agreement between positive/negative classifications of the Elecsys® assay and the EDITM ELISAs (IgM or IgG) was 90%. The false positivity rates in the healthy blood donors and the ICU patients were < 1% for the Elecsys® assay and < 3% for the EDITM ELISAs.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein trimer mediates virus entry into host cells and cytopathic effects (syncytium formation). We studied the contribution of several S glycoprotein features to these functions, focusing on those that differ among related coronaviruses. Acquisition of the furin cleavage site by the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein decreased virus stability and infectivity, but greatly enhanced syncytium-forming ability. Notably, the D614G change found in globally predominant SARS-CoV-2 strains increased infectivity, modestly enhanced responsiveness to the ACE2 receptor and susceptibility to neutralizing sera, and tightened association of the S1 subunit with the trimer. Apparently, these two features of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, the furin cleavage site and D614G, have evolved to balance virus infectivity, stability, cytopathicity and antibody vulnerability. Although the endodomain (cytoplasmic tail) of the S2 subunit was not absolutely required for virus entry or syncytium formation, alteration of palmitoylated cysteine residues in the cytoplasmic tail decreased the efficiency of these processes. As proteolytic cleavage contributes to the activation of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, we evaluated the ability of protease inhibitors to suppress S glycoprotein function. Matrix metalloprotease inhibitors suppressed S-mediated cell-cell fusion, but not virus entry. Synergy between inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases and TMPRSS2 suggests that both host proteases can activate the S glycoprotein during the process of syncytium formation. These results provide insights into SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein-host cell interactions that likely contribute to the transmission and pathogenicity of this pandemic agent.IMPORTANCE The development of an effective and durable SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is essential for combating the growing COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein is the main target of neutralizing antibodies elicited during virus infection or following vaccination. Knowledge of the spike glycoprotein evolution, function and interactions with host factors will help researchers to develop effective vaccine immunogens and treatments. Here we identify key features of the spike glycoprotein, including the furin cleavage site and the D614G natural mutation, that modulate viral cytopathic effects, infectivity and sensitivity to inhibition. We also identify two inhibitors of host metalloproteases that block S-mediated cell-cell fusion, a process that contributes to the destruction of the virus-infected cell.","Nguyen, Hanh T; Zhang, Shijian; Wang, Qian; Anang, Saumya; Wang, Jia; Ding, Haitao; Kappes, John C; Sodroski, Joseph",J. virol,103,0

METHODS: This cross-sectional, web-based study included Saudi adult patients with T1DM who attended at least one virtual phone visit with the diabetes clinic at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, between August 1 and December 31, 2020. Patients anonymously answered a Google form-created Arabic questionnaire. Information about patient characteristics, outcome, and perception of the virtual phone visit were obtained. Data were presented using descriptive statistics, chi-square, one-way ANOVA, independent t-, and Welch's t-tests. RESULTS: The questionnaire was sent to 281 patients, of whom 201 completed it. 59.2% patients were satisfied with their overall virtual phone clinic experience, and 75.6% preferred to continue attending the virtual phone clinics in the future. The average perception value of patients toward virtual phone clinics was 67.76 ± 19.9, suggesting good perception among the majority. Negative or neutral views of current health, asking to be physically seen, and missing a virtual appointment were associated with significantly lower average patient perception value (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Most Saudi patients with T1DM have adapted to virtual phone consultations, exhibiting good satisfaction and perception, and high preference to continue using this system in the future. The utilization of the service to assist patients with diabetes is highly encouraged, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The cyclic peptide inhibitor is designed to mimic the conformation of a substrate at a C-terminal autolytic cleavage site of Mpro. The cyclic peptide contains a [4-(2-aminoethyl)phenyl]-acetic acid (AEPA) linker that is designed to enforce a conformation that mimics a peptide substrate of Mpro. In vitro evaluation of the cyclic peptide inhibitor reveals that the inhibitor exhibits modest activity against Mpro and does not appear to be cleaved by the enzyme. Conformational searching predicts that the cyclic peptide inhibitor is fairly rigid, adopting a favorable conformation for binding to the active site of Mpro. Computational docking to the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro suggests that the cyclic peptide inhibitor can bind the active site of Mpro in the predicted manner. Molecular dynamics simulations provide further insights into how the cyclic peptide inhibitor may bind the active site of Mpro. Although the activity of the cyclic peptide inhibitor is modest, its design and study lays the groundwork for the development of additional cyclic peptide inhibitors against Mpro with improved activities.","Kreutzer, Adam G; Krumberger, Maj; Diessner, Elizabeth M; Parrocha, Chelsea Marie T; Morris, Michael A; Guaglianone, Gretchen; Butts, Carter T; Nowick, James S",Eur J Med Chem,103,1

The need for establishing evidence for the effectiveness of vaccines, therapeutic treatments and policies that could resolve or control the crisis has resulted in development of efficient designs for clinical trials that can be concluded with smaller sample sizes in a shorter time period. Design of Bayesian adaptive trials, however, requires extensive simulation studies that is considered a disadvantage in time-sensitive settings such as the pandemic. In this paper, we propose a set of methods for efficient estimation and uncertainty quantification for the design operating characteristics of Bayesian adaptive trials.

However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV–host interactome and drug targets in the human protein–protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV–host interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the “Complementary Exposure” pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV–host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.","Zhou, Yadi; Hou, Yuan; Shen, Jiayu; Huang, Yin; Martin, William; Cheng, Feixiong",Cell Discov.,103,23

In total we report more than 900 alternatively spliced mRNAs produced from the Ad2 transcriptome whereof more than 850 are novel mRNAs. A surprising finding was that more than 50% of all E1A transcripts extended upstream of the previously defined transcriptional start site. The novel start sites mapped close to the inverted terminal repeat (ITR) and within the E1A enhancer region. We speculate that novel promoters or enhancer driven transcription, so-called eRNA transcription, is responsible for producing these novel mRNAs. Their existence was verified by a peptide in the Ad2 proteome that was unique for the E1A ITR mRNA. Although we show a high complexity of alternative splicing from most early and late regions, the E3 region was by far the most complex when expressed at late times of infection. More than 400 alternatively spliced mRNAs were observed in this region alone. These mRNAs included extended L4 mRNAs containing E3 and L5 sequences and readthrough mRNAs combining E3 and L5 sequences. Our findings demonstrate that the virus has a remarkable capacity to produce novel exon combinations, which will offer the virus an evolutionary advantage to change the gene expression repertoire and protein production in an evolving environment.IMPORTANCE Work in the adenovirus system led to the groundbreaking discovery of RNA splicing and alternative RNA splicing in 1977. These mechanisms are essential in mammalian evolution by increasing the coding capacity of a genome. Here, we have used a long-read sequencing technology to characterize the complexity of human adenovirus pre-mRNA splicing in detail. It is mindboggling that the viral genome, which only houses around 36,000 bp, not being much larger than a single cellular gene, generates more than 900 alternatively spliced mRNAs. Recently, adenoviruses have been used as the backbone in several promising SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Further improvement of adenovirus-based vaccines demands that the virus can be tamed into an innocent carrier of foreign genes. This requires a full understanding of the components that govern adenovirus replication and gene expression.","Westergren Jakobsson, Amanda; Segerman, Bo; Wallerman, Ola; Lind, Sara Bergström; Zhao, Hongxing; Rubin, Carl-Johan; Pettersson, Ulf; Akusjärvi, Göran",J. virol,103,24

Good leadership image in times of a health emergency is paramount to ensure public confidence towards government's ability to manage the crisis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify types of image repair strategies utilized by the Malaysian government in their communication about COVID-19 in the media. The study then analyzes public responses toward these messaging on social media. METHODS: A content analysis was employed to analyze 120 media statements and 382 comments retrieved from Facebook pages of two mainstream newspapers, Berita Harian and The Star. These media statements and comments were collected within a span of 6 weeks prior to and during the first implementation of Movement Control Order by the Malaysian Government. The media statements were analyzed according to Benoit's Image Repair Theory to categorize strategies employed in government's communication related to COVID-19 crisis. Public opinion responses were measured using modified lexicon-based VADER sentiment analysis to categorize positive, negative and neutral statements. RESULTS: The Malaysian government employed all 5 Image Repair Theory strategies in their communications in both newspapers. The strategy most utilized was the reduce offensiveness strategy (62.5%), followed by corrective action (25.0%), evading responsibilities (8.3%), denial (3.3%) and mortification (0.8%). This study also found multiple sub-strategies in government's media statements including denial, shifting blame, provocation, defeasibility, accident, good intention, bolstering, minimization, differentiation, transcendence, attacking accuser, resolve problem, prevent recurrence, admit wrongdoing and apologize. This study also found that 64.7% of public opinion was positive towards media statements made by the Malaysian government. This study also revealed a significant positive association between Image Repair Strategies utilized by the Malaysian government and public opinion. CONCLUSIONS: Communication in the media may assist the government to foster positive support from the public.

Here, using next-generation sequencing (NGS) short-read and Nanopore long-read poly(A) RNA sequencing in two cell types at multiple time points after infection with SARS-CoV-2, we identified hundreds of template switches and constructed the dynamic landscapes of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomes. Interestingly, template switching could occur in a bidirectional manner, with diverse SARS-CoV-2 subgenomes generated from successive template-switching events. The majority of template switches result from RNA-RNA interactions, including seed and compensatory modes, with terminal pairing status as a key determinant. Two TRS-independent template switch modes are also responsible for subgenome biogenesis. Our findings reveal the subgenome landscape of SARS-CoV-2 and its regulatory features, providing a molecular basis for understanding subgenome biogenesis and developing novel anti-viral strategies.","Wang, Dehe; Jiang, Ao; Feng, Jiangpeng; Li, Guangnan; Guo, Dong; Sajid, Muhammad; Wu, Kai; Zhang, Qiuhan; Ponty, Yann; Will, Sebastian; Liu, Feiyan; Yu, Xinghai; Li, Shaopeng; Liu, Qianyun; Yang, Xing-Lou; Guo, Ming; Li, Xingqiao; Chen, Mingzhou; Shi, Zheng-Li; Lan, Ke; Chen, Yu; Zhou, Yu",Mol Cell,103,10

This study evaluated immunity over time. Design, setting, participants, and measurementsThis retrospective cohort study included maintenance dialysis patients from a midsize national dialysis provider who received a complete SARS-CoV-2 vaccine series and had at least one antibody titer checked after full vaccination. Immunoglobulin G spike antibodies (SAb-IgG) titers were assessed monthly with routine labs beginning after full vaccination and followed over time; the semiquantitative SAb-IgG titer reported a range between 0 and [≥] 20 U/L. Descriptive analyses compared trends over time by prior history of COVID-19 and type of vaccine received. Time-to-event analyses were conducted for the outcome of loss of seroresponse (SAb-IgG < 1 U/L or development of COVID-19). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to adjust for additional clinical characteristics of interest. ResultsAmong 1898 maintenance dialysis patients, 1567 (84%) had no prior history of COVID-19. Patients without a history of COVID-19 had declining titers over time. Among 441 BNT162b2/Pfizer recipients, median [IQR] SAb-IgG titer declined from 20 [5.99-20] U/L in month 1 to 1.30 [0.15-3.59] U/L by month 6. Among 779 mRNA-1273/Moderna recipients, median [IQR] SAb-IgG titer declined from 20 [20-20] in month 1 to 6.20 [1.74-20] by month 6. The 347 Ad26.COV2.S/Janssen recipients had a lower titer response than mRNA vaccine recipients over all time periods. In time-to-event analyses, Ad26.COV2.S/Janssen and mRNA-1273/Moderna recipients had the shortest and longest time to loss of seroresponse, respectively. The maximum titer reached in the first two months after full vaccination was predictive of the durability of the SAb-IgG seroresponse; patients with SAb-IgG titer 1-19.99 U/L were more likely to have loss of seroresponse compared to patients with SAb-IgG titer [≥] 20 U/L (HR 23.9 [95% CI: 16.1-35.5]). ConclusionsVaccine-induced seroresponse wanes over time among maintenance dialysis patients across vaccine types. Early titers after full vaccination predict the durability of seroresponse.","Hsu, Caroline M; Weiner, Daniel E; Manley, Harold J; Aweh, Gideon N; Ladik, Vladimir; Frament, Jill; Miskulin, Dana; Agyropoulos, Christos; Abreo, Kenneth; Chin, Andrew; Gladish, Reginald; Salman, Loay; Johnson, Doug; Lacson, Eduardo K",,103,12

The overall theme of these reports was that 'electricity use has decreased during the pandemic, but the power grid is still reliable' - mostly due to reduced economic activity. In this paper, we analyze electricity data until the end of May 2020, examining both electricity demand and variables that can indicate stress on the power grid. We limit this study to three states in the U.S. California, Florida and New York. The results indicate that the effect of the pandemic on electricity demand is not a simple reduction, and there are noticeable differences among regions analyzed. The variables that can indicate stress on the grid (e.g., daily peak and trough of the hourly demand, demand ramp rate, demand forecast error, and net electricity interchange) also conveyed mixed messages: some indicate an increase in stress, some indicate a decrease, and some do not indicate any clear difference. A positive message is that some of the changes that were observed around the time stay-at-home orders were issued appeared to revert back by May 2020. A key challenge in ascribing any observed change to the pandemic is correcting for weather as it can be challenging to accurately define it for large geographic regions. We provide a weather-correction method, apply it to a small city-wide area in North Central Florida, and discuss the implications of the estimated changes in demand. The results indicate that a 10% (95% CI [2%, 18%]) increase in electricity demand is likely to have occurred due to COVID-19 for the city analyzed.","Agdas, Duzgun; Barooah, Prabir",IEEE Access,103,16

We analyzed the COVID-19 data from the nationwide health insurance claims of South Korea. Data on demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and mortality records of patients with COVID-19 were extracted from the database. The odds ratios of mortality according to comorbidities in these patients with and without adjustment for age and sex were calculated. The predictive value of the original Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and the age-adjusted CCI (ACCI) for mortality in these patients were investigated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Among 7590 patients, 227 (3.0%) had died. After age and sex adjustment, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, liver disease, renal disease, and cancer were significant risk factors for mortality. The ROC curve analysis showed that an ACCI threshold > 3.5 yielded the best cut-off point for predicting mortality (area under the ROC 0.92; 95% confidence interval 0.91-0.94). Our study revealed multiple risk factors for mortality in patients with COVID-19. The high predictive power of the ACCI for mortality in our results can support the importance of old age and comorbidities in the severity of COVID-19.","Cho, Soo Ick; Yoon, Susie; Lee, Ho-Jin",Sci Rep,103,24

A total of 139 patients with COVID-19 were investigated at Siirt State Hospital. According to the disease severity, the patients were categorized as three groups (moderate: 85, severe: 54, and critical: 20). Then, patients were divided into two groups: nonsevere (moderate) and severe (severe and critical). Demographic, clinical data, and routine blood parameters were analyzed. In multivariate model adjusted for potential confounders BUN/Cr ratio (odds ratio [OR] = 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-2.40; P = .002) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (OR = 2.21; 95% CI: 1.20-4.30; P < .001) were independent predictive factors for disease severity. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard model BUN/Cr ratio (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.05; P = .030), and NLR (HR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.06-1.30; P = .020) were independent predictors for survival of COVID-19 disease. The optimal thresholds of the BUN/Cr ratio at 33.5 and 51.7 had the superior possibility for severe disease and mortality, area under the curve (AUC) were 0.98 and 0.95, respectively. The optimal thresholds of NLR at 3.27 and 5.72 had a superior possibility for severe disease and mortality, AUC were 0.87 and 0.85, respectively. BUN/Cr and NLR are independent predictors for COVID-19 patient severity and survival. Routine evaluation of BUN/Cr and NLR can help identify high-risk cases with COVID-19.","Ok, Fesih; Erdogan, Omer; Durmus, Emrullah; Carkci, Serkan; Canik, Aggul",J. med. virol,103,21

Here, we present a computational model that considers both drug characteristics and membrane properties for the rapid assessment of drugs permeability through the coronavirus envelope and various cellular membranes. We analyze 79 drugs that are considered as potential candidates for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and determine their time of permeation in different organelle membranes grouped by viral baits and mammalian processes. The computational results are correlated with experimental data, present in the literature, on bioavailability of the drugs, showing a negative correlation between fast permeation and most promising drugs. This model represents an important tool capable of evaluating how permeability affects the ability of compounds to reach both intended and unintended intracellular targets in an accurate and rapid way.

However, the evidence to support this guidance is lacking. There have been relatively few cases reported about direct breastfeeding an infant by a mother with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the safety of breastfeeding and the possible protective effects of breast milk on infants. CASE PRESENTATION: This report analyzes the case of a mother who continued breastfeeding her 13 month-old child when both were diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. We describe the clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was determined in maternal serum, breast milk, nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and feces, and in infant serum, NP swabs and feces. IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were assessed in maternal serum and breast milk and in infant serum. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was not detected in the breast milk, and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in the mother's serum and milk. CONCLUSIONS: The present case further confirms that the possibility of mother-to-child transmission about SARS-CoV-2 via breast milk alone was very small, and breast milk is safe for direct feeding of infants.","Yu, Yuanyuan; Li, Youjiang; Hu, Yingying; Li, Bin; Xu, Jian",Int Breastfeed J,103,20

DESIGN: A cross-sectional population-based online survey. SETTINGS: The study was conducted in 22 provinces of the DRC. Five provinces with a satisfactory number of respondents were included in the analysis: Haut Katanga, Kasaï-Central, Kasaï-Oriental, Kinshasa and North Kivu. PARTICIPANTS: The participants were people aged &#8805;18 years, living in the DRC. A total of 3268 participants were included in the study analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Both convenience sampling (surveyors themselves contacted potential participants in different districts) and snowball sampling (the participants were requested to share the link of the questionnaire with their contacts) methods were used. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We computed adherence scores using responses to 10 questions concerning COVID-19 preventive measures recommended by the WHO and the DRC Ministry of Health. We used logistic regression analysis with generalised estimating equations to identify factors of poor adherence. We also asked about the presence or absence of flu-like symptoms during the preceding 14 days, whether a COVID-19 test was done and the test result. RESULTS: Data from 3268 participants were analysed. Face masks were not used by 1789 (54.7%) participants. Non-adherence to physical distancing was reported by 1364 (41.7%) participants. 501 (15.3%) participants did not observe regular handwashing. Five variables were associated with poor adherence: lower education level, living with other people at home, being jobless/students, living with a partner and not being a healthcare worker. CONCLUSION: Despite compulsory restrictions imposed by the government, only about half of the respondents adhered to COVID-19 preventive measures in the DRC. Disparities across the provinces are remarkable. There is an urgent need to further explore the reasons for these disparities and factors associated with non-adherence.","Ditekemena, John Dinanga; Nkamba, Dalau Mukadi; Muhindo, Hypolite Mavoko; Siewe, Joseph Nelson Fodjo; Luhata, Christophe; Van den Bergh, Rafael; Tshefu Kitoto, Antoinette; Van Damme, Wim; Muyembe, Jean Jacques; Colebunders, Robert",BMJ Open,103,24

Current sampling practice risks loss of sample to the attached negative flow, aerosolisation, or spillage, due to repeated circuit breaks, when replacing sample containers. Such concerns were highlighted during the recent coronavirus pandemic. OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of an alternative integrated sampling solution, with the Ambu Bronchosampler with aScope 4, by an experienced bronchoscopist in ICU. METHODS: An observational study of 20 sequential bronchoscopic diagnostic sampling procedures was performed on mechanically ventilated patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. Mixed methods assessment was done. The predefined outcome measures were (1) ease of set up, (2) ease of specimen collection, (3) ease of protecting specimen from loss or spillage, and (4) overall workflow. The duration of the procedure and the % volume of sample retrieved were recorded. RESULTS: The mean (±standard deviation [SD]) time for collecting 1 sample was 2.5 ± 0.8 min. The mean (±SD) specimen yield for instilled miniBAL was 54.2 ± 17.9%. Compared with standard sampling, the set-up was much easier in 18 (90%), or easier in 2 (10%) of procedures, reducing the connection steps. It was much more intuitive to use in 14 (70%), more intuitive in 4 (20%), and no more intuitive to use in 2 (10%). The overall set-up and workflow was much easier in 69% of the 13 intraprocedural connections and easier or as easy in the remaining 31% procedures. All procedures where pre connection was established were much easier (7, 100%). The Ambu Bronchosampler remained upright in all procedures with no loss or spillage of sample. Obtaining a sample was much easier in 60%, easier in 10%, no different in 20%, and worse in 10%. The ability to protect a sample from start to finish compared to standard procedures was much easier in 80%, easier in 15%, and no different in 5% of procedures. Overall workflow was much easier in 14 (70%), easier in 4 (20%), and no different in 2 (10%) of procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The Ambu Bronchosampler unit was a reliable, effective, and possibly safer technique for diagnostic sampling in ICU. It may improve safety standards during the coronavirus pandemic. A randomized control trial against the standard sampling technique is warranted.","Singh, Suveer; Shah, Pallav L",Respiration,103,29

We explore a possibility to generate such low-frequency gravitational waves from a dark sector phase transition. Assuming that the dark sector is completely decoupled from the visible sector except via the gravitational interaction, we find that some amount of dark radiation should remain until present. The NANOGrav data implies that the amount of dark radiation is close to the current upper bound, which may help mitigate the so-called Hubble tension. If the existence of dark radiation is not confirmed in the future CMB-S4 experiment, it would imply the existence of new particles feebly interacting with the standard model sector at an energy scale of O(1-100) MeV.","Nakai, Yuichiro; Suzuki, Motoo; Takahashi, Fuminobu; Yamada, Masaki",,103,16

We provide a practical strategy to reorganize pathways of emergency and elective colorectal surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: The authors, all from areas affected by the COVID-19 emergency, brainstormed remotely to define the key-points to be discussed. Tasks were assigned, concerning specific aspects of colorectal surgery during the pandemic, including the administrative management of the crisis in Italy. The recommendations (based on experience and on the limited evidence available) were collated and summarized. RESULTS: Little is known about the transmission of COVID-19, but it has shown a rapid spread. It is prudent to stop non-cancer procedures and prioritize urgent cancer treatment. Endoscopy and proctological procedures should be performed highly selectively. When dealing with colorectal emergencies, a conservative approach is advised. Specific procedures should be followed when operating on COVID-19-patients, using dedicated personal protective equipment and adhering to specific rules. Some policies are described, including minimally-invasive surgery. These policies outline the strict regulation of entry/ exit into theatres and operating building as well as advice on performing procedures safely to reduce risk of spreading the virus. It is likely that a reorganization of health system is required, both at central and local levels. A description of the strategy adopted in Italy is provided. CONCLUSION: Evidence on the management of patients needing surgery for colorectal conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic is currently lacking. Lessons learnt from healthcare professionals that have managed high volumes of surgical patients during the pandemic could be useful to mitigate some risks and reduce exposure to other patients, public and healthcare staff.","Di Saverio, S; Pata, F; Gallo, G; Carrano, F; Scorza, A; Sileri, P; Smart, N; Spinelli, A; Pellino, G",Colorectal Dis,103,1

Lockdown measures have substantial societal effects, including a significant impact on parents with (young) children. Given the existence of persistent gender inequality prior to the pandemic, particularly among parents, it is crucial to study the societal impact of COVID-19 from a gender perspective. The objective of this paper is to use representative survey data gathered among Dutch parents in April 2020 to explore differences between mothers and fathers in three areas: paid work, the division of childcare and household tasks, and three dimensions of quality of life (leisure, work-life balance, relationship dynamics). Additionally, we explore whether changes take place in these dimensions by comparing the situation prior to the lockdown with the situation during the lockdown. METHOD: We use descriptive methods (crosstabulations) supported by multivariate modelling (linear regression modelling for continuous outcomes; linear probability modelling (LPM) for binary outcomes (0/1 outcomes); and multinomial logits for multinomial outcomes) in a cross-sectional survey design. RESULTS: Results show that the way in which parents were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic reflects a complex gendered reality. Mothers work in essential occupations more often than fathers, report more adjustments of the times at which they work, and experience both more and less work pressure in comparison to before the lockdown. Moreover, mothers continue to do more childcare and household work than fathers, but some fathers report taking on greater shares of childcare and housework during the lockdown in comparison to before. Mothers also report a larger decline in leisure time than fathers. We find no gender differences in the propensity to work from home, in perceived work-life balance, or in relationship dynamics. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we find that gender inequality in paid work, the division of childcare and household work, and the quality of life are evident during the first lockdown period. Specifically, we find evidence of an increase in gender inequality in relation to paid work and quality of life when comparing the situation prior to and during the lockdown, as well as a decrease in gender inequality in the division of childcare and household work. We conclude that the unique situation created by restrictive lockdown measures magnifies some gender inequalities while lessening others. DISCUSSION: The insights we provide offer key comparative evidence based on a representative, probability-based sample for understanding the broader impact of lockdown measures as we move forward in the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the limitations in this study is the cross-sectional design. Further study, in the form of a longitudinal design, will be crucial in investigating the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gender inequality.","Yerkes, Mara A; André, Stéfanie C H; Besamusca, Janna W; Kruyen, Peter M; Remery, Chantal L H S; van der Zwan, Roos; Beckers, Debby G J; Geurts, Sabine A E",PLoS One,103,24

Lower incidence associated with prophylactic administration of Ivermectin,14.712841,9.560286,2020,"Estimating the unreported cases of Covid-19 in a region/country is a complicated problem. We propose a new mathematical model that, combined with a deterministic model of the total growth of cases, describes the time evolution of the unreported cases for each reported Covid-19 case. The new model considers the growth of unreported cases in plateau periods and the decrease towards the end of an epidemic wave. We combined the new model with a Gompertz-growth model, a generalized logistic model, and a susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model; and fitted them via Bayesian methods to data from Cuba and Spain. The combined-model fits yielded better Bayesian-Information-Criterion values than the Gompertz, logistic, and SIR models alone. This suggests the new model can achieve improved descriptions of the evolution of a Covid-19 epidemic wave. The new model is also able to provide reliable predictions of the epidemic evolution in a short period of time. We include in the paper the steps that researchers should take to use the new model for predictions with other data.","Ramirez-Torres, Erick E.; Castaneda, Antonio R.

SUMMARY: Compounded drugs may serve an important medical need for patients who cannot be treated with medications approved by FDA; however, compounded drugs are not approved by FDA and are not subject to premarket review for safety, efficacy, or manufacturing quality; thus, they may pose safety risks to patients. Prompt reporting of adverse events or complaints related to compounding is important in identifying these risks and implementing safeguards to protect the public. FDA's Compounding Incidents Program consists of a team of pharmacists dedicated to the surveillance and review of adverse events and complaints and follow-up actions related to safety risks associated with compounded drugs. Pharmacists are a vital component of FDA's Compounding Incidents Program, utilizing their clinical skill set and regulatory knowledge to review and act on safety issues that affect public health. CONCLUSION: As FDA continues to expand the Compounding Incidents Program and its efforts to protect the public against poor-quality compounded drugs, we encourage the continued submission of adverse event reports by healthcare professionals and consumers to FDA's MedWatch reporting system in addition to adverse event reporting compliance by outsourcing facilities.","Janusziewicz, Ashlee N; Glueck, Shannon N; Park, Sophia Y; Nguyen, Dien N; Rimmel, Susan C; Cascio, Laurelle A; Doh, Gina Y; Martin-Yeboah, Garrette F",Am J Health Syst Pharm,103,20

METHODS: The validation, in addition to the evaluation of precision and accuracy, included the analysis of the effects of the main procedures that are currently being used for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation in saliva and a pilot study to evaluate the possible changes in salivary tADA and isoenzymes in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The automated assay proved to be accurate and precise, with intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation below 8.2%, linearity under dilution linear regression with R2 close to 1, and recovery percentage between 80 and 120% in all cases. This assay was affected when the sample is treated with heat or SDS for virus inactivation but tolerated Triton X-100 and NP-40. Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=71) and who recovered from infection (n=11) had higher mean values of activity of tADA and its isoenzymes than healthy individuals (n=35). CONCLUSIONS: tADA and its isoenzymes ADA1 and ADA2 can be measured accurately and precisely in saliva samples in a rapid, economical, and reproducible way and can be analyzed after chemical inactivation with Triton X-100 and NP-40. Besides, the changes observed in tADA and isoenzymes in individuals with COVID-19 open the possibility of their potential use as non-invasive biomarkers in this disease.","Franco-Martínez, Lorena; Tecles, Fernando; Torres-Cantero, Alberto; Bernal, Enrique; San Lázaro, Indra; Alcaraz, María José; Vicente-Romero, María R; Lamy, Elsa; Sánchez-Resalt, Cristina; Rubio, Camila P; Tvarijonaviciute, Asta; Martínez-Subiela, Silvia; Cerón, José J",Clin. chem. lab. med,103,17

Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the early variation in the SARS-CoV-2 genome was still intra-species, with no evolution to other coronaviruses. There were one to seven nucleotide variations (SNVs) in each genome and all SNVs were distributed in various fragments of the genome. The Spike protein bound with human receptor, an amino acid salt bridge and a potential furin cleavage site were found in the SARS-CoV-2 using molecular modeling.

While fever, cough, and respiratory distress are typical first symptoms, a fraction of those affected present instead with neurological symptoms suggestive of central nervous system compromise. This review summarizes the potential contribution of coronavirus disease 2019 to hemorrhagic stroke in the elderly and proposes possible mechanisms. Reports show that the most affected patients have underlying chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, which are two key risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is the main host cell surface receptor interacting with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike glycoprotein to allow viral entry and infection. We speculate that ensuing downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression may compound the risk conferred by pre-existing comorbidities and critically influence the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic stroke by elevating blood pressure and impairing cerebrovascular endothelial function. Additionally, both age- and/or disease-related immune dysfunction and enhanced catecholamine release secondary to anxiety and stress may also aggravate central nervous system symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Thus, assessment of systemic inflammatory biomarkers and tight control of hemodynamic parameters upon admission are crucial to minimize mortality and morbidity in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with central nervous system symptoms suggestive of incipient stroke.","Wang, Haili; Tang, Xiaojia; Fan, Hongyang; Luo, Yuhan; Song, Yuxia; Xu, Yao; Chen, Yingzhu",Aging (Albany NY),103,16

We aimed to investigate factors associated with prolonged and intermittent viral RNA shedding in a retrospective cohort of symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Methods: Demographic, clinical and laboratory data from hospitalised COVID-19 patients from a single centre with two consecutive negative respiratory reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results were extracted from electronic medical records. Kaplan–Meier survival curve analysis was used to assess the effect of clinical characteristics on the duration and pattern of shedding. Plasma levels of immune mediators were measured using Luminex multiplex microbead-based immunoassay. Results: There were 201 symptomatic patients included. Median age was 49 years (interquartile range 16–61), and 52.2% were male. Median RNA shedding was 14 days (IQR 9–18). Intermittent shedding was observed in 77 (38.3%). We did not identify any factor associated with prolonged or intermittent viral RNA shedding. Duration of shedding was inversely correlated with plasma levels of T-cell cytokines IL-1β and IL-17A at the initial phase of infection, and patients had lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines during intermittent shedding. Conclusions: Less active T-cell responses at the initial phase of infection were associated with prolonged viral RNA shedding, suggesting that early immune responses are beneficial to control viral load and prevent viral RNA shedding. Intermittent shedding is common and may explain re-detection of viral RNA in recovered patients.","Lee, Pei Hua; Tay, Woo Chiao; Sutjipto, Stephanie; Fong, Siew-Wai; Ong, Sean Wei Xiang; Wei, Wycliff Enli; Chan, Yi-Hao; Ling, Li Min; Young, Barnaby E; Toh, Matthias Paul HS; Renia, Laurent; Ng, Lisa FP; Leo, Yee-Sin; Lye, David C; Lee, Tau Hong",Clin.

Irrespective of where care is received, maternal safety and wellbeing should be preserved. Despite ongoing efforts, however, this is not the case. Large gaps exist between spending and clinical outcomes. Segmented health care, coupled with poor planning and inadequate resource distribution, results in failure to provide essential life-saving treatment.

One age-associated defect in human T cells is the reduced expression of miR-181a. miR-181ab1 deficiency in peripheral murine T cells causes delayed viral clearance after infection, resembling human immune aging. Here we show that naive T cells from older individuals as well as miR-181ab1-deficient murine T cells develop excessive replication stress after activation, due to reduced histone expression and delayed S-phase cell cycle progression. Reduced histone expression was caused by the miR-181a target SIRT1 that directly repressed transcription of histone genes by binding to their promoters and reducing histone acetylation. Inhibition of SIRT1 activity or SIRT1 silencing increased histone expression, restored cell cycle progression, diminished the replication-stress response, and reduced the production of inflammatory mediators in replicating T cells from old individuals.

Our intervention examines how governmental social media health promotion in India played a key role in shaping the ‘outbreak narrative’ during the lockdown across different levels of social and economic privilege. Through a combination of quantitative data analysis and qualitative interview methods, this article analyzes the circulation and impact of official publicity in online and offline spaces, during the COVID-19 lockdown in India. Resultant findings allow for a comprehensive assessment of whether such publicity contributed to democratized citizen science discourses: enabling social protection measures for vulnerable majorities or potentially reified the existing privileges of the economically and socially affluent minority. We find that health promotion campaigns during a pandemic must focus on reaching the widest possible audience in the most efficient manner. Specifically, in the Indian context, health promotion through mass-media like Television and Radio, and participatory media platforms needed to be implemented in tandem with new media platforms, to achieve required engagement with vulnerable communities on key health issues.","Roy, Dibyadyuti; Das, Madhurima; Deshbandhu, Aditya",Health Promot Int,103,16

However, its ubiquitous presence in human life does not allow the study of social touch deprivation ‘in the wild’.

In this study, 1746 participants completed an online survey to examine intimate, friendly and professional touch experiences during COVID-19-related restrictions, their impact on mental health and the extent to which touch deprivation results in craving touch. We found that intimate touch deprivation during COVID-19-related restrictions is associated with higher anxiety and greater loneliness even though this type of touch is still the most experienced during the pandemic. Moreover, intimate touch is reported as the type of touch most craved during this period, thus being more prominent as the days practising social distancing increase. However, our results also show that the degree to which individuals crave touch during this period depends on individual differences in attachment style: the more anxiously attached, the more touch is craved; with the reverse pattern for avoidantly attached. These findings point to the important role of interpersonal and particularly intimate touch in times of distress and uncertainty.","von Mohr, Mariana; Kirsch, Louise P.; Fotopoulou, Aikaterini",Royal Society open science,103,26

Multiple studies have reported high rates of post-operative mortality and pulmonary complications. We present 30-day outcomes on an initial cohort of patients undergoing elective foot and ankle surgery at 3 central London hospitals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective review of the first 63 patients undergoing surgery following the first UK surge via a modified treatment pathway, based on published national guidelines, designed to minimise the risks to patients and staff associated with COVID-19. RESULTS: 90% of patients were ASA 1 or 2, with an average age of 46. All tested negative for COVID-19 pre-operatively and all but one underwent a general anaesthetic. 10 patients required one night hospital stays and 1 was admitted for four nights. 52 were day case procedures. 2 complications were identified, not relating to COVID-19 infection. No 30-day mortalities or pulmonary complications were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: With a community prevalence of COVID-19 of between 1 in 1500 and 1 in 1700, elective foot and ankle surgery was safe following the first surge of the pandemic in the UK. This data can guide elective service planning in countries with pandemic curves behind the UK’s or in the event of further surges in national cases.","Groom, William D.; Garner, Madeleine; Chan, Oliver; Latif, Ahmed; Francis, Randhir; Singh, Sam; Abbasian, Ali",Foot (Edinb),103,20

Despite significant advances in in silico design and structure-based assembly, most engineered NPs are refractory to soluble expression and fail to assemble as designed, presenting major challenges in the manufacturing process. The failure is due to a lack of understanding of the kinetic pathways and enabling technical platforms to ensure successful folding of the monomer antigens into regular assemblages. Capitalizing on a novel function of RNA as a molecular chaperone (chaperna: chaperone + RNA), we provide a robust protein-folding vehicle that may be implemented to NP assembly in bacterial hosts. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was fused with the RNA-interaction domain (RID) and bacterioferritin, and expressed in Escherichia coli in a soluble form. Site-specific proteolytic removal of the RID prompted the assemblage of monomers into NPs, which was confirmed by electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The mutations that affected the RNA binding to RBD significantly increased the soluble aggregation into amorphous structures, reducing the overall yield of NPs of a defined size. This underscored the RNA-antigen interactions during NP assembly. The sera after mouse immunization effectively interfered with the binding of MERS-CoV RBD to the cellular receptor hDPP4. The results suggest that RNA-binding controls the overall kinetic network of the antigen folding pathway in favor of enhanced assemblage of NPs into highly regular and immunologically relevant conformations. The concentration of the ion Fe(2+), salt, and fusion linker also contributed to the assembly in vitro, and the stability of the NPs. The kinetic “pace-keeping” role of chaperna in the super molecular assembly of antigen monomers holds promise for the development and delivery of NPs and virus-like particles as recombinant vaccines and for serological detection of viral infections.","Kim, Young-Seok; Son, Ahyun; Kim, Jihoon; Kwon, Soon Bin; Kim, Myung Hee; Kim, Paul; Kim, Jieun; Byun, Young Ho; Sung, Jemin; Lee, Jinhee; Yu, Ji Eun; Park, Chan; Kim, Yeon-Sook; Cho, Nam-Hyuk; Chang, Jun; Seong, Baik L.",Front Immunol,103,16

Matériel et méthodes Tous les patients ont été contactés par téléphone entre le 1er et le 10 juin 2020 et interrogés sur leurs symptômes cliniques éventuellement apparus depuis le 11 mars 2020. Résultats Quatre cent quatre-vingt-cinq patients psoriasiques traités par biothérapies ont été interrogés. L’âge moyen des patients était de 54,5 ans±10 et 320 (66 %) étaient de sexe masculin.

Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed.

While this virus primarily targets the alveoli in the lungs, multiple authors have described an increased rate of thrombo-embolic events in affected patients. We present this case of a myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary atherosclerosis in an otherwise healthy 48-year-old patient. CASE SUMMARY: A 48-year-old female, presenting with chest pain radiating to her left shoulder with no cardiovascular risk factors other than genetic predisposition, was screened for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and tested positive. Although computed tomography angiography excluded obstructive coronary heart disease, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed an acute myocardial infarction with no obstructive coronary arteries of the inferior wall. The patient was treated with dual anti-platelet therapy, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor and a statin, and assigned to a cardiac rehabilitation program. CONCLUSION: We report a serious thrombo-embolic event during an oligosymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in a healthy, young patient. While these two diseases may have occurred simultaneously, by chance, it is possible that the pro-thrombotic effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection facilitated the infarction. This case further demonstrates the significant cardiovascular morbidity potentially caused by SARS-CoV-2.","Burkert, Francesco Robert; Niederreiter, Lukas; Dichtl, Wolfgang; Mayr, Agnes; Virgolini, Irene; Klauser, Andrea; Weiss, Günter; Bellmann-Weiler, Rosa",Eur Heart J Case Rep,103,30

Design: The data consist of 41 thematic one-on-one interviews conducted during May–December 2020 with family members of nursing home residents. Convenience sampling was utilized by asking several nursing homes in different parts of Finland to relay a contact request from the researchers to the residents’ family members. The main themes of the interviews were lockdown and visiting restrictions. Subthemes included the frequency of visits, other means of interaction, changes in the relationships of family members with their loved ones and with nursing home staff, and the feelings aroused by the situation. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, resulting in 794 pages of data. Method: The qualitative study uses inductive content analysis. NVivo12 software facilitated the systematic coding of the data. Results: According to the family members, distancing aggravated the residents’ pre-existing conditions: they reported a sudden progression in memory disorders and significant deterioration in physical abilities, for example. Both residents and family members experienced anxiety, grief, and severe stress, and family members expressed concern that residents might die due to a lack of social contact and activity. Family members were also frustrated about not being able to touch their relatives or participate in their care, and therefore sometimes thought that their visits were useless. New forms of interaction with family members, introduced by the nursing homes, were appreciated. However, some family members perceived the interactional protocols as unfair and complained about insufficient information. Conclusions: The findings underline the need for nursing homes to implement a good interactional protocol. Overall, the results show that the measures taken to protect residents’ health during the Covid-19 outbreak were short-sighted in terms of the social dimension of well-being. It is therefore important to continue developing safe and humane solutions for interaction when social restrictions are in place. Tweetable abstract: Covid-19-related distancing has caused anxiety, grief, and severe stress for nursing home residents and their family members.","Paananen, Jenny; Rannikko, Johanna; Harju, Maija; Pirhonen, Jari",Int J Nurs Stud Adv,103,26

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 435 inpatients at a hospital in the Campania Region of Southern Italy using the PMOS-30 questionnaire and two other questions to assess patient feedback about the overall perception of safety. Results: The item “I was always treated with dignity and respect” showed the greatest percentage of agreement (agree/strongly agree = 89.2%; mean = 4.24). The least agreement was associated with the four “Staff Roles and Responsibilities” items (agree/strongly agree ranged from 31.5 to 40.0%; weighted mean = 2.84). All other 25 items had over 55.0% agreement, with 19 items over 70%. Moreover, 94.5% of the patients considered the safety of the ward sufficient/good/very good, and 92.8% did not notice situations that could cause harm to patients. Conclusion: Patient perception of safety was found to be satisfactory. The results were presented to the hospital decision makers for suggesting appropriate interventions.

In addition, individuals were encouraged to adopt personal health measures such as social isolation. Information regarding the disease and recommended avoidance measures were distributed through a variety of channels including social media, news websites, and emails. Previous research suggests that the vast amount of available information can be confusing, potentially resulting in overconcern and information overload. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the impact of online information on the individual-level intention to voluntarily self-isolate during the pandemic. Using the protection-motivation theory as a framework, we propose a model outlining the effects of cyberchondria and information overload on individuals’ perceptions and motivations. METHODS: To test the proposed model, we collected data with an online survey (N=225) and analyzed it using partial least square-structural equation modeling. The effects of social media and living situation were tested through multigroup analysis. RESULTS: Cyberchondria and information overload had a significant impact on individuals’ threat and coping perceptions, and through them on self-isolation intention. Among the appraisal constructs, perceived severity (P=.002) and self-efficacy (P=.003) positively impacted self-isolation intention, while response cost (P<.001) affected the intention negatively. Cyberchondria (P=.003) and information overload (P=.003) indirectly affected self-isolation intention through the aforementioned perceptions. Using social media as an information source increased both cyberchondria and information overload. No differences in perceptions were found between people living alone and those living with their families. CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19, frequent use of social media contributed to information overload and overconcern among individuals. To boost individuals’ motivation to adopt preventive measures such as self-isolation, actions should focus on lowering individuals’ perceived response costs in addition to informing them about the severity of the situation.","Farooq, Ali; Laato, Samuli; Islam, A K M Najmul",J Med Internet Res,103,24

METHODS: Using a retrospective, longitudinal cohort study design on consecutive patients with severe COVID-19, we used an extensive biochemical dataset of serial data and time-series design to estimate the occurrence of organ dysfunction and the severity of the inflammatory reaction and their association with acute respiratory failure (ARF) and death. FINDINGS: On the 162 studied patients, 1151 biochemical explorations were carried out for up to 59 biochemical markers, totaling 15,260 biochemical values. The spectrum of biochemical abnormalities and their kinetics were consistent with a multi-organ involvement, including lung, kidney, heart, liver, muscle, and pancreas, along with a severe inflammatory syndrome. The proportion of patients who developed an acute kidney injury (AKI) stage 3, increased significantly during follow-up (0·9%, day 0; 21·4%, day 14; P<0·001). On the 20 more representative biochemical markers (>250 iterations), only CRP >90 mg/L (odds ratio [OR] 6·87, 95% CI, 2·36–20·01) and urea nitrogen >0·36 g/L (OR 3·91, 95% CI, 1·15–13·29) were independently associated with the risk of ARF. Urea nitrogen >0·42 g/L was the only marker associated with the risk of COVID-19 related death.

However, liking can be influenced by mood, with people feeling more uncomfortable, or more unhappy reporting lower liking ratings than those in a higher affect. Though consumer testing typically takes place as a central location test (CLT, usually in a set of standardized sensory booths), the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global pivot to home use tests (HUTs), where panelists can taste and smell samples unmasked more safely while in their own homes. Unfortunately, as this situation differs in many ways to a central location test, this puts the validity of longitudinal comparisons of liking scores under question. Further, as people across the globe report feelings of worry, unease, and stress during the pandemic, this may present a second source of variation in affect with previous years. We tested a set of snack bar samples both at home and in a central location, in repeated measures with the same panel, to test the validity of comparisons across locations. We further compared CLT results to those when testing the same samples in a previous year. Finally, we performed a meta-analysis of existing data on this subject. While liking behavior in CLTs did not differ between years, panelists rated some samples higher when in their own homes, in line with results from the meta-analysis of previous reports. Interestingly, panelists in the study also assigned fewer penalties in the HUT, implying a less analytical mindset when in the home. Results suggest that care should be taken when comparing results taken at home during the COVID-19 pandemic to those taken previously in a central location. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Consumer testing is applied in the food industry to evaluate a panelist's liking for a food product or stimulus. However, liking is also dependent on factors extrinsic to the samples tested. Thus, with the switch to in-home testing due to COVID-19, we compared liking scores from in-home and central locations testing, with higher scores common in HUTs.","Shi, Menghan; Stelick, Alina; Licker, Susan; Dando, Robin",Journal of food science,103,20

However, in the reduction of system complexity, the intricacies of vasculature are an often-overlooked aspect of MPS design. The growing library of pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cell and perivascular cell protocols have great potential to improve the physiological relevance of vasculature within MPS, specifically for in vitro disease modeling. Three strategic categories of vascular MPS are outlined: self-assembled, interface focused, and 3D biofabricated.

We have previously shown that self-collected nasal swabs (NS) are feasible and as sensitive as clinician-collected nasal washes for detection of RV, but the additive benefit of self-collected throat swabs is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the added yield of self-collected nasal to throat swabs for detection of RV by PCR in patients with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: Patients with URTI symptoms self-collected paired polyurethane foam NS and nylon flocked throat swabs and completed a symptom survey. Swabs were tested for 12 RV by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Descriptive, McNemar's, and Wilcoxon signed rank statistical tests were used. RESULTS: 115 paired nasal and throat swabs were collected from 63 individuals, with 71/115 (62%) positive for a RV by at least one specimen, including 51 positive by both, 17 positive by NS only, and 3 positive by throat swab only. The sensitivity of NS was 96% (95%CI: 88-99) versus 76% (95% CI: 65-85) in throat swabs, p<0.001. The median PCR cycle threshold (Ct) in 51 concordant samples was lower (indicating higher viral concentration) in NS (25.1) versus throat swabs (32.0). The three samples positive only by throat swab had high Ct values (33.8, 36.2, and 38.8, all rhinovirus). CONCLUSION: Self-collection of NS was significantly more sensitive than self collection of throat swabs for detection of RV by RT-PCR.

Extensive efforts have been made in the past decade to elucidate the relationship between resource allocation and phenotypic patterns of microorganisms. Despite these exciting developments, there is still a lack of explicit comparison between potentially competing propositions and a lack of synthesis of inter-related proposals and findings. RESULTS: In this work, we have reviewed resource allocation-derived principles, hypotheses and mathematical models to recapitulate important achievements in this area. In particular, the emergence of resource allocation phenomena is deciphered by the putative tug of war between the cellular objectives, demands and the supply capability. Competing hypotheses for explaining the most-studied phenomenon arising from resource allocation, i.e. the overflow metabolism, have been re-examined towards uncovering the potential physiological root cause. The possible link between proteome fractions and the partition of the ribosomal machinery has been analysed through mathematical derivations. Finally, open questions are highlighted and an outlook on the practical applications is provided. It is the authors' intention that this review contributes to a clearer understanding of the role of resource allocation in resolving bacterial growth strategies, one of the central questions in microbiology. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown the importance of resource allocation in understanding various aspects of cellular systems. Several important questions such as the physiological root cause of overflow metabolism and the correct interpretation of 'protein costs' are shown to remain open. As the understanding of the mechanisms and utility of resource application in cellular systems further develops, we anticipate that mathematical modelling tools incorporating resource allocation will facilitate the circuit-host design in synthetic biology.","Zeng, Hong; Rohani, Reza; Huang, Wei E; Yang, Aidong",BMC Bioinformatics,103,21

Recent reports suggest that bacterial co-infection at time of presentation is uncommon in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, estimates were based on microbiology tests alone. We sought to develop and apply consensus definitions, incorporating clinical criteria to better understand the rate of co-infections and antibiotic use in COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 1016 adult patients admitted to 5 hospitals in the Johns Hopkins Health System between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020, with COVID-19 were evaluated. Adjudication of co-infection using definitions developed by a multidisciplinary team for this study was performed. Both respiratory and common nonrespiratory co-infections were assessed. The definition of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (bCAP) included proven (clinical, laboratory, and radiographic criteria plus microbiologic diagnosis), probable (clinical, laboratory, and radiographic criteria without microbiologic diagnosis), and possible (not all clinical, laboratory, and radiographic criteria met) categories. Clinical characteristics and antimicrobial use were assessed in the context of the consensus definitions. RESULTS: Bacterial respiratory co-infections were infrequent (1.2%); 1 patient had proven bCAP, and 11 (1.1%) had probable bCAP. Two patients (0.2%) had viral respiratory co-infections. Although 69% of patients received antibiotics for pneumonia, the majority were stopped within 48 hours in patients with possible or no evidence of bCAP. The most common nonrespiratory infection was urinary tract infection (present in 3% of the cohort). CONCLUSIONS: Using multidisciplinary consensus definitions, proven or probable bCAP was uncommon in adults hospitalized due to COVID-19, as were other nonrespiratory bacterial infections. Empiric antibiotic use was high, highlighting the need to enhance antibiotic stewardship in the treatment of viral pneumonias.","Karaba, Sara M; Jones, George; Helsel, Taylor; Smith, L Leigh; Avery, Robin; Dzintars, Kathryn; Salinas, Alejandra B; Keller, Sara C; Townsend, Jennifer L; Klein, Eili; Amoah, Joe; Garibaldi, Brian T; Cosgrove, Sara E; Fabre, Valeria",Open Forum Infect Dis,103,1

We aimed to compare anxiety levels of quarantined and non-quarantined people and investigate factors affecting anxiety during the second COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1837 participants were included in this cross-sectional study. Anxiety was measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Participants were divided into the quarantined group (QG) and non-quarantined group (Non-QG). The mean STAI-S score in the QG was significantly higher than Non-QG (41.8±11.2 vs 40.01±9.9), so was the proportion of severe state anxiety (11.6% vs 5.5%). Males in the QG were significantly more anxious than females evaluated by both STAI-S and STAI-T. High income was independent protective factors while moderate or bad health status and high trait anxiety level were independent risk factors for severe state anxiety. In conclusion, the COVID-19 confinement could significantly increase anxiety of quarantined people. Males were more vulnerable to the quarantine of COVID-19 with significantly increased anxiety level than females.

However, to date, there is an only a limited effective treatment for this disease. Human placenta hydrolysate (hPH) has previously been shown to be safe and to improve the health condition in patients with hyperferritinemia and COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to determine the antiviral effects of hPH against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo models and compared with Remdesivir, an FDA-approved drug for COVID-19 treatment. To assess whether hPH inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, we determined the CC(50), EC(50), and selective index (SI) in Vero cells by infection with a SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.01. Further, groups of ferrets infected with 10(5.8) TCID(50)/ml of SARS-CoV-2 and treated with hPH at 2, 4, 6 dpi, and compared their clinical manifestation and virus titers in respiratory tracts with PBS control-treated group. The mRNA expression of immune-related cytokines was determined by qRT-PCR. hPH treatment attenuated virus replication in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. In a ferret infection study, treatment with hPH resulted in minimal bodyweight loss and attenuated virus replication in the nasal wash, turbinates, and lungs of infected ferrets. In addition, qRT-PCR results revealed that the hPH treatment remarkably upregulated the gene expression of type I (IFN-α and IFN-β) and II (IFN-γ) IFNs in SARS-CoV-2 infected ferrets. Our data collectively suggest that hPH has antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and might be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Kim, Eun-Ha; Kim, Young-il; Jang, Seung-Gyu; Im, Minju; Jeong, Kyeongsoo; Choi, Young Ki; Han, Hae-Jung",J Microbiol,103,20

Together with the quest for an effective treatment, the question of the post-infectious evolution of affected patients in healing process remains uncertain. Krebs von den Lungen 6 (KL-6) is a high molecular weight mucin-like glycoprotein produced by type II pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells. Its production is raised during epithelial lesions and cellular regeneration. In COVID-19 infection, KL-6 serum levels could therefore be of interest for diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response evaluation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study retrospectively compared KL-6 levels between a cohort of 83 COVID-19 infected patients and two other groups: healthy subjects (n = 70) on one hand, and a heterogenous group of patients suffering from interstitial lung diseases (n = 31; composed of 16 IPF, 4 sarcoidosis, 11 others) on the other hand. Demographical, clinical and laboratory indexes were collected. Our study aims to compare KL-6 levels between a COVID-19 population and healthy subjects or patients suffering from interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). Ultimately, we ought to determine whether KL-6 could be a marker of disease severity and bad prognosis. RESULTS: Our results showed that serum KL-6 levels in COVID-19 patients were increased compared to healthy subjects, but to a lesser extent than in patients suffering from ILD. Increased levels of KL-6 in COVID-19 patients were associated with a more severe lung disease. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that KL-6 could be a good biomarker to assess ILD severity in COVID-19 infection. Concerning the therapeutic response prediction, more studies are necessary.","Frix, AN; Schoneveld, L.; Ladang, A.; Henket, M.; Duysinx, B.; Vaillant, F.; Misset, B.; Moutschen, M.; Louis, R.; Cavalier, E.; Guiot, J.",Respir Res,103,6

Many people do not have the opportunity to express their wishes and die in their preferred place of death. Advance care planning (ACP) involves discussion, decisions and documentation about how an individual contemplates their future death. Recording end-of-life preferences gives patients a sense of control over their future. Coordinate My Care (CMC) is London’s largest electronic palliative care register designed to provide effective ACP, with information being shared with urgent care providers. The aim of this study is to explore determinants of dying in hospital. Understanding advance plans and their outcomes can help in understanding the potential effects that implementation of electronic palliative care registers can have on the end-of-life care provided. Retrospective observational cohort analysis included 21,231 individuals aged 18 or older with a Coordinate My Care plan who had died between March 2011 and July 2019 with recorded place of death. Logistic regression was used to explore demographic and end-of-life preference factors associated with hospital deaths. 22% of individuals died in hospital and 73% have achieved preferred place of death. Demographic characteristics and end-of-life preferences have impact on dying in hospital, with the latter having the strongest influence. The likelihood of in-hospital death is substantially higher in patients without documented preferred place of death (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.26–1.62, p<0.001), in those who prefer to die in hospital (OR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.60–3.30, p<0.001) and who prefer to be cared in hospital (OR = 2.77, 95% CI 1.94–3.96, p<0.001). “Not for resuscitation” individuals (OR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.37–0.50, p<0.001) and who preferred symptomatic treatment (OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.33–0.40, p<0.001) had a lower likelihood of in-hospital death. Effective advance care planning is necessary for improved end-of-life outcomes and should be included in routine clinical care. Electronic palliative care registers could empower patients by embedding patients’ wishes and personal circumstances in their care plans that are accessible by urgent care providers.","Orlovic, Martina; Callender, Tom; Riley, Julia; Darzi, Ara; Droney, Joanne",PLoS One,103,11

After such individuals have cleared the virus, only the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunological memory can reveal the exposure, and hopefully the establishment of immune protection. With most viral infections, the presence of specific serum antibodies has provided a reliable biomarker for the exposure to the virus of interest. SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, does not reliably induce a durable antibody response, especially in sub-clinically infected individuals. Consequently, it is plausible for a recently infected individual to yield a false negative result within only a few months after exposure. Immunodiagnostic attention has therefore shifted to studies of specific T cell memory to SARS-CoV-2. Most reports published so far agree that a T cell response is engaged during SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they also state that in 20-81% of SARS-CoV-2-unexposed individuals, T cells respond to SARS-CoV-2 antigens (mega peptide pools), allegedly due to T cell cross-reactivity with Common Cold coronaviruses (CCC), or other antigens. Here we show that, by introducing irrelevant mega peptide pools as negative controls to account for chance cross-reactivity, and by establishing the antigen dose-response characteristic of the T cells, one can clearly discern between cognate T cell memory induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection vs. cross-reactive T cell responses in individuals who have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Lehmann, Alexander A.; Kirchenbaum, Greg A.; Zhang, Ting; Reche, Pedro A.; Lehmann, Paul V.",Front Immunol,103,30

It has been postulated that BCG protection against SARS-CoV-2 has a potential role in the pandemic, through the presence of homologous amino acid sequences. To identify a possible link between BCG vaccination coverage and COVID-19 cases, we used official epidemic data and Ecuadorian Ministry of Health and Pan American Health Organization vaccination information. BCG information before 1979 was available only at a national level. Therefore, projections based on the last 20 years were performed, to compare by specific geographic units. We used a Mann–Kendall test to identify BCG coverage variations, and mapping was conducted with a free geographic information system (QGIS). Nine provinces where BCG vaccine coverage was lower than 74.25% show a significant statistical association (χ(2) Pearson’s = 4.800, df = 1, p = 0.028), with a higher prevalence of cases for people aged 50 to 64 years than in younger people aged 20 to 49 years. Despite the availability of BCG vaccination data and the mathematical models needed to compare these data with COVID-19 cases, our results show that, in geographic areas where BCG coverage was low, 50% presented a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases that were young; thus, low-coverage years were more affected.","Garzon-Chavez, Daniel; Rivas-Condo, Jackson; Echeverria, Adriana; Mozo, Jhoanna; Quentin, Emmanuelle; Reyes, Jorge; Teran, Enrique",Vaccines (Basel),103,19

Limited data are available in China to describe the epidemiology of viral respiratory infections, especially in small–medium cities and rural areas. OBJECTIVES: To determine the viral etiology and seasonality of acute respiratory infections in hospitalized children, a 3-year study was conducted in Shenzhen, China. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates from eligible children were collected. Influenza and other respiratory viruses were tested by molecular assays simultaneously. Data were analyzed to describe the frequency and seasonality. RESULTS: Of the 2025 children enrolled in the study, 971 (48·0%) were positive for at least one viral pathogen, in which 890 (91·7%) were <4 years of age. The three most prevalent viruses were influenza A (IAV; 35·8%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; 30·5%) and human rhinovirus (HRV; 21·5%). Co-infections were found in 302 cases (31·1%), and dual viral infection was dominant. RSV, HRV and IAV were the most frequent viral agents involved in co-infection. On the whole, the obvious seasonal peaks mainly from March to May were observed with peak strength varying from 1 year to another. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a basic profile of the epidemiology of acute respiratory viral infection in hospitalized children in Shenzhen. The spectrum of viruses in the study site is similar to that in other places, but the seasonality is closely related to geographic position, different from that in big cities in northern China and neighboring Hong Kong.","He, Ying; Lin, Guang-Yu; Wang, Qiong; Cai, Xiao-Ying; Zhang, Yin-Hui; Lin, Chuang-Xing; Lu, Chang-Dong; Lu, Xue-Dong",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,103,24

One of the most urgent demands affects the diagnostic tests. The growing need for rapid and accurate laboratory diagnostic tests requires the development of biotechnological processes aimed at producing reagents able to cope with this demand in a scalable, cost-effective manner, with rapid turnaround times. This is particularly applicable to the antigens employed in serological tests. Recombinant protein expression using plants as biofactories is particularly suitable for mass production of protein antigens useful in serological diagnosis, with a neat advantage in economic terms. METHODS: We expressed a large portion of the nucleoprotein (N) derived from SARS-CoV-2 in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. After purification, the recombinant N protein obtained was used to develop an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human sera. To validate the ELISA, a panel of 416 sera from exposed personnel at essential services in Madrid City Council were tested, and the results compared to those obtained by another ELISA, already validated, used as reference. Furthermore, a subset of samples for which RT-PCR results were available were used to confirm sensitivity and specificity of the test. RESULTS: The performance of the N protein expressed in plants as antigen in serologic test for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection was shown to be highly satisfactory, with calculated diagnostic sensitivity of 96.41% (95% CI: 93.05–98.44) and diagnostic specificity of 96.37 (95% CI: 93.05–98.44) as compared to the reference ELISA, with a kappa (K) value of 0.928 (95% CI:0.892–0.964). Furthermore, the ELISA developed with plant-derived N antigen detected SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 84 out of 93 sera from individuals showing RT-PCR positive results (86/93 for the reference ELISA). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the N protein part derived from SARS-CoV-2 expressed in plants performs as a perfectly valid antigen for use in COVID-19 diagnosis. Furthermore, our results support the use of this plant platform for expression of recombinant proteins as reagents for COVID-19 diagnosis. This platform stands out as a convenient and advantageous production system, fit-for-purpose to cope with the current demand of this type of biologicals in a cost-effective manner, making diagnostic kits more affordable.","Williams, Laura; Jurado, Silvia; Llorente, Francisco; Romualdo, Alberto; González, Sara; Saconne, Ana; Bronchalo, Isabel; Martínez-Cortes, Mercedes; Pérez-Gómez, Beatriz; Ponz, Fernando; Jiménez-Clavero, Miguel Ángel; Lunello, Pablo",Front Plant Sci,103,4

The disease has baffled scientists and doctors worldwide in terms of its presentation, behaviour, and treatment options till now. A low mortality rate is the only relief we get so far from COVID-19 in terms of numbers. Treatment options have gradually streamlined to steroids and very few FDA approved antiviral as well as plasma therapy and supportive treatment. Monoclonal antibodies are used to tide over any impending cytokine storm but are not equally effective in all patients. Ventilation support is invariably required for moderate to severe disease varying from a simple High Flow non-rebreathing mask to BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) and HFNO (High-Flow Nasal Oxygen) extending to full-fledge ventilation via a Mechanical Ventilator. Because of the non-availability of satisfactory treatment so far, many researchers from different biomedical fields are looking for alternative therapeutic strategies to manage the pandemic. One such therapeutic approach showing a ray of hope to combat COVID-19 infection is Mesenchymal stem cell therapy. Mesenchymal cells have immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory as well as regenerative properties and various preliminary studies have shown that MSCs can reverse the lung damage and overcome the cytokine storm incited by COVID-19 infection.

To understand the influence of cross-reactive T cell responses, we used IEDB (Immune epitope database) and NetMHCpan (ver. 4.1) to identify candidate CD8(+) T cell epitopes, restricted through HLA-A and B alleles. Conservation analysis was carried out for these epitopes with HCoVs, OC43, HKU1, and NL63. 12/18 the candidate CD8(+) T cell epitopes (binding score of ≥0.90), which had a high degree of homology (>75%) with the other three HCoVs were within the NSP12 and NSP13 proteins.

The psychological mechanisms that determine stress, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures, are not yet clear. In a survey during the lockdown in Switzerland (n=1565), we found substantially increased levels of stress in the population. In particular, individuals who did not agree with the containment measures, as well as those who saw nothing positive in the crisis, experienced even higher levels of stress. In contrast, individuals who are part of a risk group or who are working in healthcare or in essential shops experienced similar stress levels as the general public. We conducted a path analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the psychological mechanisms during lockdown. Experiencing fear of the disease is a key driver for being worried. Our model further shows that worries about the individual, social, and economic consequences of the crisis, strongly boost stress. The infection rate in the canton (i.e. state) of residence also contributes to stress. Positive thinking and perceived social, organizational, and governmental support mitigate worries and stress. To prevent stress, authorities should explain containment measures well, highlight positive aspects of the crisis, address worries, and facilitate support.","Wissmath, B.; Mast, F.

METHODS: We described all adults with COVID-19 or influenza discharged from inpatient medical services and medical–surgical intensive care units (ICUs) between Nov. 1, 2019, and June 30, 2020, at 7 hospitals in Toronto and Mississauga, Ontario. We compared patient outcomes using multivariable regression models, controlling for patient sociodemographic factors and comorbidity level. We validated the accuracy of 7 externally developed risk scores to predict mortality among patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: There were 1027 hospital admissions with COVID-19 (median age 65 yr, 59.1% male) and 783 with influenza (median age 68 yr, 50.8% male). Patients younger than 50 years accounted for 21.2% of all admissions for COVID-19 and 24.0% of ICU admissions. Compared with influenza, patients with COVID-19 had significantly greater in-hospital mortality (unadjusted 19.9% v. 6.1%, adjusted relative risk [RR] 3.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.56–4.68), ICU use (unadjusted 26.4% v. 18.0%, adjusted RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.25–1.80) and hospital length of stay (unadjusted median 8.7 d v. 4.8 d, adjusted rate ratio 1.45, 95% CI 1.25–1.69).

Furthermore, we introduce evolutionary information search dynamics and study the dynamics of population search strategies. For each value of searching for information, we compute evolutionarily stable information (ESI) search strategies (occurring in non-cooperative environments), which are the attractors of the information search dynamics, and the optimal information (OI) search strategy (occurring in (eventually forced) cooperative environments) that maximizes the expected information payoff for the population. For rumors that are advantageous or harmful to the population (positive or negative impact), we show the existence of distinct scenarios that depend on the value of searching for truthful information. We fully discuss which evolutionarily stable information (ESI) search strategies and which optimal information (OI) search strategies eradicate (or not) the rumor and the corresponding expected payoffs. As a corollary of our results, a recommendation for legislators and policymakers who aim to eradicate harmful rumors is to make the search for truthful information free or rewarding.","Martins, José; Pinto, Alberto",Entropy (Basel),103,20

METHODS: We conducted a combined assessment of the changes in neutralising antibody levels and SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific T‐cell responses over time in 27 patients up to 7 months after infection. RESULTS: The neutralising antibody remained detectable in 96.3% of the patients at their second visit at about 7 months post‐onset of symptoms. However, their humoral responses, including titres of the spike receptor‐binding domain IgG and neutralising antibody, decreased significantly compared with those at first clinic visit. By contrast, the proportions of spike‐specific CD4(+) T cells, but not CD8(+) T cells, in COVID‐19 patients after recovery were persistently higher than those in healthy controls. No significant change was observed in the proportion of spike‐specific CD4(+) T cells in patients who had recovered from COVID‐19 within 7 months. CONCLUSION: The SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific T‐cell immune responses persisted, while the neutralising antibodies decayed. Further studies are needed to extend the longevity of neutralising antibodies and to evaluate whether these T cells are sufficient to protect patients from reinfection.","Chen, Jun; Liu, Xiaomin; Zhang, Xinyu; Lin, Yixiao; Liu, Danping; Xun, Jingna; Wang, Zhenyan; Gu, Ling; Li, Qian; Yin, Dan; Yang, Junyang; Lu, Hongzhou",Clin Transl Immunology,103,18

The ability of the plant umbravirus, groundnut rosette virus, to move long distances through the phloem, the specialized plant vascular system, has been shown to strictly depend on the interaction of one of its proteins, the ORF3 protein (protein encoded by open reading frame 3), with fibrillarin. This interaction is essential for several stages in the groundnut rosette virus life cycle such as nucleolar import of the ORF3 protein via Cajal bodies, relocalization of some fibrillarin from the nucleolus to cytoplasm, and assembly of cytoplasmic umbraviral ribonucleoprotein particles that are themselves required for the long-distance spread of the virus and systemic infection. Here, using atomic force microscopy, we determine the architecture of these complexes as single-layered ringlike structures with a diameter of 18–22 nm and a height of 2.0 ± 0.4 nm, which consist of several (n = 6–8) distinct protein granules. We also estimate the molar ratio of fibrillarin to ORF3 protein in the complexes as approximately 1:1. Based on these data, we propose a model of the structural organization of fibrillarin–ORF3 protein complexes and discuss potential mechanistic and functional implications that may also apply to other viruses.","Canetta, Elisabetta; Kim, Sang Hyon; Kalinina, Natalia O.; Shaw, Jane; Adya, Ashok K.; Gillespie, Trudi; Brown, John W.S.; Taliansky, Michael",J Mol Biol,103,21

The average number of new cases per day fell to 6.4 in the first week of May and currently 90% of all confirmed cases have fully recovered after a massive outbreak in February 29. First, South Korea has flattened the curve of COVID-19 by combining testing, early isolation, and free treatment of positive cases combined with digital technologies without taking to “lockdown” measures. Second, South Korea has been holding press briefings twice a day and disclosed all information on COVID-19 to the public in an open and transparent manner. Third, South Korea has worked to secure the civic participation and voluntary engagement of citizens and businesses. The South Korean approach to COVID-19 may be difficult to emulate even for countries like the U.S. and U.K., but provides important policy implications for developing countries and needs for strengthening three core competencies against the outbreak of an epidemic: digital technology, efficient health governance, and civic partnership. It is a great challenge for developing countries to fight alone against COVID-19.

During the infection process, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein plays a crucial role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process by interacting with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. However, new variants of these spike proteins emerge as the virus passes through the disease reservoir. This poses a major challenge for designing a potent antigen for an effective immune response against the spike protein. Through a normal mode analysis (NMA) we identified the highly flexible region in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, starting from residue 475 up to residue 485. Structurally, the position S477 shows the highest flexibility among them. At the same time, S477 is hitherto the most frequently exchanged amino acid residue in the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 mutants. Therefore, using MD simulations, we have investigated the role of S477 and its two frequent mutations (S477G and S477N) at the RBD during the binding to hACE2. We found that the amino acid exchanges S477G and S477N strengthen the binding of the SARS-COV-2 spike with the hACE2 receptor.","Singh, Amit; Steinkellner, Georg; Köchl, Katharina; Gruber, Karl; Gruber, Christian C.",Sci Rep,103,1

Nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples are generally collected for serial viral load screening of respiratory contagions, but temporal profiles of these samples are not completely clear in patients with COVID-19. We performed an observational cohort study at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, which involved 31 patients with confirmed COVID-19 with or without underlying diseases. We obtained samples from each patient, and serial viral load was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We found that the viral load in the sputum was inclined to be higher than samples obtained from the nasopharyngeal swab at disease presentation. Moreover, the viral load in the sputum decreased more slowly over time than in the nasopharyngeal group as the disease progressed. Interestingly, even when samples in the nasopharyngeal swab turned negative, it was commonly observed that patients with underlying diseases, especially hypertension and diabetes, remained positive for COVID-19 and required a longer period for the sputum samples to turn negative. These combined findings emphasize the importance of tracking sputum samples even in patients with negative tests from nasopharyngeal swabs, especially for those with underlying conditions. In conclusion, this work reinforces the importance of sputum samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection to minimize transmission of COVID-19 within the community.","Liu, R.; Yi, S.; Zhang, J.; Lv, Z.; Zhu, C.; Zhang, Y.",J Dent Res,103,16

Despite male infertility being a serious global issue, “bits and pieces” of its complex etiopathology still remain missing. During inflammation, levels of proinflammatory mediators in the male reproductive tract are greater than usual. According to epidemiological research, in numerous cases of male infertility, patients suffer from acute or chronic inflammation of the genitourinary tract which typically occurs without symptoms. Inflammatory responses in the male genital system are inextricably linked to oxidative stress (OS). OS is detrimental to male fertility parameters as it causes oxidative damage to reproductive cells and intracellular components. Multifarious male infertility causative factors pave the way for impairing male reproductive functions via the common mechanisms of OS and inflammation, both of which are interlinked pathophysiological processes, and the occurrence of any one of them induces the other. Both processes may be simultaneously found in the pathogenesis of male infertility. Thus, the present article aims to explain the role of inflammation and OS in male infertility in detail, as well as to show the mechanistic pathways that link causative factors of male reproductive tract inflammation, OS induction, and oxidant-sensitive cellular cascades leading to male infertility.","Dutta, Sulagna; Sengupta, Pallav; Slama, Petr; Roychoudhury, Shubhadeep",Int J Mol Sci,103,1

Aim: In this study, we aimed to measure and evaluate the level of awareness and knowledge of the prevention, symptoms, and transmission control of COVID-19 before and after quarantine among the residents of Rabigh city and adjacent villages in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in two stages: the first stage took place before quarantine and the second stage took place after quarantine. The survey was filled out electronically. Results: A total of 448 participants responded and filled out the questionnaires. Females (73.70%) formed the largest number of participants for both stages. The majority of the participants were <30 years old (50.90%) and had a high education level in various sectors and levels (97.1%). It was noticeable that during the first stage, the participants' awareness of COVID-19 symptoms was not very high: 13.62% did not know about the symptoms. However, by the second stage, awareness about symptoms had increased (9.6%).

COVID-19 pandemic poses a burden on hospital resources and intensive care unit (ICU) occupation. The study aimed to derive a scoring system that, assessed upon patient first-contact evaluation, predicts the need for admission to ICU. Methods. All consecutive patients admitted to a COVID-19 reference center were prospectively assessed. Patients were segregated into a group that required admission to ICU during their hospitalization and a group that never required ICU admission and was already discharged from hospitalization. Three models including clinical, laboratory and imaging findings were derived by logistic regression analysis and internally validated. A score, defined as the ABC-GOALS score was created by assigning values based on the variables weighted odd ratios. Results. The study comprised 329 patients, 115 (35%) required ICU admission and 214 (65%) were hospitalized and discharged from general wards. The clinical prediction model (ABC-GOALSc) included sex, obesity, the Charlson comorbidity index, dyspnea, arterial pressure and respiratory rate at triage evaluation. The clinical plus laboratory model (ABC-GOALScl) added serum albumin, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase and S/F ratio to the clinical model. The model that included imaging (ABC-GOALSclx) added the CT scan finding of >50% lung involvement. All three models outperformed other pneumonia-specific scores with area under the curve of 0.79 (0.74-0.83), 0.86 (0.82-0.90) and 0.88 (0.84-0.92) for the clinical, laboratory and imaging model, respectively. Conclusion. The ABC-GOALS score is a tool to evaluate patients with COVID-19 at admission to the emergency department that allows to timely predict their risk of admission to an ICU and may help optimize healthcare capacities.","Mejia-Vilet, J.

This longitudinal study aimed to clarify the association between these and non-monetary incentives to vaccination in the UK. METHOD: Data were collected at three points: (1) before and (2) after the development of a vaccine and (3) after the vaccination programme was underway. At Time 1, participants completed measures of general and COVID-19-specific concerns about vaccination and belief in conspiracy theories. At times 2 and 3, participants reported their intentions whether or not to have the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Those who were hesitant provided qualitative comments about what might change their decision. RESULTS: Vaccination hesitancy decreased between times 1 (54%) and 3 (13%). There were small effects of conspiracy beliefs on vaccine hesitancy, but only at time 1. Most concerns and reported incentives were related to safety, although at time 2, incentives included endorsement by trusted public figures. By time 3, only a minority of participants (N = 18) were adamantly against vaccination, stating that nothing would change their minds. CONCLUSION: Vaccination hesitancy declined in the UK during the course of the study. However, concerns about vaccine safety remained and could jeopardise the vaccination programme should any adverse effects be reported. Conspiracy beliefs seem to play only a minor role in hesitancy and may continue to decrease in importance with a successful vaccination programme. Understanding motivations behind vaccination hesitancy is vital if we are to achieve population immunity.","Bacon, Alison M.; Taylor, Steven",Int J Behav Med,103,24

As such, there are numerous players involved to ensure that the proteins are properly localized. Overall, transport requires vesicle budding, recognition of the vesicle by the target membrane and fusion of the vesicle with the target membrane resulting in delivery of its contents. The initial interaction between the vesicle and the target membrane has been referred to as tethering. Because this is the first contact between the two membranes, tethering is critical to ensuring that specificity is achieved. It is therefore not surprising that there are numerous ‘tethering factors’ involved ranging from multisubunit complexes, coiled-coil proteins and Rab guanosine triphosphatases. Of the multisubunit tethering complexes, one of the best studied at the molecular level is the evolutionarily conserved TRAPP complex. There are two forms of this complex: TRAPP I and TRAPP II. In yeast, these complexes function in a number of processes including endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi transport (TRAPP I) and an ill-defined step at the trans Golgi (TRAPP II). Because the complex was first reported in 1998 (1), there has been a decade of studies that have clarified some aspects of its function but have also raised further questions. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in our understanding of yeast and mammalian TRAPP at the structural and functional levels and its role in disease while trying to resolve some apparent discrepancies and highlighting areas for future study.","Sacher, Michael; Kim, Yeon-Gil; Lavie, Arnon; Oh, Byung-Ha; Segev, Nava",Traffic,103,16

METHOD: A survey of 788 U.S. adults was conducted to explore the relationships between demographics and psychosocial predictors of intent to get a future COVID-19 vaccine as well as willingness to get such a vaccine under EUA. RESULTS: Significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake intentions were education, having insurance, scoring high on subjective norms, a positive attitude toward the vaccine, as well as high perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, high perceived benefits of the vaccine, scoring low on barriers to the vaccine, and scoring high on self-efficacy. Predictors of willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine under EUA were age, race/ethnicity, positive subjective norms, high perceived behavioral control, positive attitudes toward the vaccine, as well as high perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, high perceived benefits of the vaccine, low barriers to the vaccine, and scoring high on self-efficacy for getting the vaccine. Concerns about rushed vaccine development appear to reduce vaccine uptake intent, as well as willingness to get the vaccine under EUA. IMPLICATIONS: COVID-19 vaccine-related messages should both address concerns about the vaccine and its development and reinforce benefits of the vaccine (both factors significant in both models). Vaccine efforts may need to go beyond just communications campaigns correcting misinformation about a COVID-19 vaccine to also focus on re-establishing public trust in government agencies.","Guidry, Jeanine P.D.; Laestadius, Linnea I.; Vraga, Emily K.; Miller, Carrie A.; Perrin, Paul B.; Burton, Candace W.; Ryan, Mark; Fuemmeler, Bernard F.; Carlyle, Kellie E.",Am J Infect Control,103,1

Mechanistic studies and drug discovery have focused on RNA synthesis by the highly conserved RdRp. The second active site, which resides in a Nidovirus RdRp-Associated Nucleotidyl transferase (NiRAN) domain, is poorly characterized, but both catalytic reactions are essential for viral replication. One study showed that NiRAN transfers NMP to the first residue of RNA-binding protein nsp9; another reported a structure of nsp9 containing two additional N-terminal residues bound to the NiRAN active site but observed NMP transfer to RNA instead. We show that SARS-CoV-2 RdRp NMPylates the native but not the extended nsp9. Substitutions of the invariant NiRAN residues abolish NMPylation, whereas substitution of a catalytic RdRp Asp residue does not.

In Australia, human, animal and ecological health are managed by separate sectors with limited communication. This study aims to explore how professionals in these fields perceive a One Health approach to zoonotic disease surveillance, aiming to identify the challenges to the implementation of an integrated system in Australia. Using a qualitative research method, ten semistructured interviews were conducted with academic experts to gain insight into the possibility of developing an integrated surveillance system in Australia. A thematic analysis of the data was undertaken. Findings showed the absence of a clear definition and subsequent vision for the future of One Health act as a barrier to interdisciplinary collaboration, and that siloed approaches by different sectors restrict the ability for professionals to work collaboratively across disciplines. An understanding of disease transmission was considered by participants to be a necessary requirement for a successful One Health approach. Finally, participants considered political will an essential requirement for the integration of surveillance systems. This study demonstrates that for a One Health approach to be implemented in an Australian setting, those working in the fields of human, animal and ecological health must agree on several aspects. The establishment of a formal governance body with representatives from each sector could assist in overcoming long‐standing barriers of privacy and distrust. Further, developing interdisciplinary training in One Health concepts for medical, environmental and veterinary students may encourage cross‐disciplinary collaboration. Finally, demonstrating to policymakers the economic benefit of improved and timely detection of zoonoses may help in facilitating a structured One Health approach to disease surveillance in Australia.","Johnson, I.; Hansen, A.; Bi, P.",Zoonoses Public Health,103,24

Here, we compare 24-hour composite samples from the influents of two different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in South Carolina, USA: Columbia and Rock Hill. The sampling intervals span the months of July 2020 and January 2021, which cover the first and second waves of elevated SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 clinical cases in these regions. We identify four signature mutations in the surface glycoprotein (spike) gene that are associated with the following variants of concern, or VOC (listed in parenthesis): S477N (B.1.526, Iota), T478K (B.1.617.2, Delta), D614G (present in all VOC as of May 2021), and H655Y (P.1, Gamma). The N501Y mutation, which is associated with three variants of concern, was identified in samples from July 2020, but not detected in January 2021 samples. Comparison of mutations identified in viral sequence databases such as NCBI Virus and GISAID indicated that wastewater sampling detected mutations that were present in South Carolina, but not reflected in the clinical data deposited into databases.","Swift, Candice L.; Isanovic, Mirza; Correa Velez, Karlen E.; Norman, R.

Here, we report for the first time a case of a 45-year-old female patient with known FOP recovering from COVID-19 with disease progression potentially linked with the viral illness. In December 2020 the patient contracted a mild form of COVID-19 infection without need for hospital admission. Since January 2021, the patient felt unwell, with occasional abdominal pain which progressively intensified. In March 2021 she presented with new onset of HO, complaining of pain, swelling and thickening sensation in the lower abdomen and left part of the neck. Computerized tomography (CT) and cytokine analysis were performed. CT scan revealed new heterotopic bone formation in multiple soft tissue areas of the neck indicating clear radiological progression. Radiotherapy, which has proven to be an efficient tool to control HO in this patient, was not able to halt HO formation after COVID-19 infection. Cytokine analysis of a plasma sample obtained during a flare-up after COVID-19 infection showed a significantly elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to a flare-up panel prior to infection. Of the 23 analyzed levels of cytokines, a staggering number of 21 were above normal levels.

There is substantial concern that the use of existing ICU triage protocols to allocate scarce ventilators and critical care resources—most of which are designed to save as many lives as possible—may compound these inequities. As governments and health systems revisit their triage guidelines in the context of impending resource shortages, scholars have advocated a range of alternative allocation strategies, including the use of a random lottery to give all patients in need an equal chance of ICU treatment. However, both the save-the-most-lives approach and random allocation are seriously flawed. In this Perspective, we argue that ICU triage policies should simultaneously promote population health outcomes and mitigate health inequities. These ethical goals are sometimes in conflict, which will require balancing the goals of maximizing the number of lives saved and distributing health benefits equitably across society. We recommend three strategies to mitigate health inequities during ICU triage: introducing a correction factor into patients’ triage scores to reduce the impact of baseline structural inequities; giving heightened priority to individuals in essential, high-risk occupations; and rejecting use of longer-term life expectancy and categorical exclusions as allocation criteria. We present a practical triage framework that incorporates these strategies and attends to the twin public health goals of promoting population health and social justice.","White, Douglas B.; Lo, Bernard",Am J Respir Crit Care Med,103,16

It is commonly believed that, within a matter of weeks, telemedicine was widely and successfully implemented and that medicine is forever changed. The experience on the ground, however, is more nuanced, with both positive and negative experiences for patients and clinicians. Advanced models of team-based care with in-room support (aTBC) have developed over the past decade, with strategic delegation of tasks to uptrained support staff, allowing physicians to provide undivided attention to their patients and greater access to care for their populations. Herein, we describe our initial experiences with telemedicine in the context of many years practicing in aTBC models. Our experience demonstrates that when implementing telemedicine visits, it is important to avoid a reflex reversion to the outmoded model of the physician alone in the room with the patient and instead bring forth the safety, quality, and satisfaction advantages associated with aTBC.

The impact of delayed treatment and the differences in decline and recovery should inform approaches for the ongoing treatment of patients both during and post pandemic. PURPOSE: We examined changes in urological care delivery due to COVID-19 in the U.S. based on patient, practice, and local/regional demographic and pandemic response features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed real-world data from the American Urological Association Quality (AQUA) Registry collected from electronic health record systems. Data represented 157 outpatient urological practices and 3,165 providers across 48 U.S. states and territories, including 3,297,721 unique patients, 12,488,831 total outpatient visits and 2,194,456 procedures. The primary outcome measure was the number of outpatient visits and procedures performed (inpatient or outpatient) per practice per week, measured from January 2019 to February 2021. RESULTS: We found large (>50%) declines in outpatient visits from March 2020 to April 2020 across patient demographic groups and states, regardless of timing of state stay-at-home orders. Nonurgent outpatient visits decreased more across various nonurgent procedures (49%-59%) than for procedures performed for potentially urgent diagnoses (38%-52%); surgical procedures for nonurgent conditions also decreased more (43%-79%) than those for potentially urgent conditions (43%-53%). African American patients had similar decreases in outpatient visits compared with Asians and Caucasians, but also slower recoveries back to baseline. Medicare-insured patients had the steepest declines (55%), while those on Medicaid and government insurance had the lowest percentage of recovery to baseline (73% and 69%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides real-world evidence on the decline in urological care across demographic groups and practice settings, and demonstrates a differential impact on the utilization of urological health services by demographics and procedure type.","Lee, Daniel J; Shelton, Jeremy B; Brendel, Paul; Doraiswami, Rahul; Makarov, Danil; Meeks, William; Fang, Raymond; Roe, Matthew T; Cooperberg, Matthew R",J Urol,103,11

Significant activity against leukemia in mice was demonstrated for extracts of Cephalotaxus. Cephalotaxine (CET) (1), the major alkaloid of this series was isolated from Cephalotaxus drupacea species by Paudler in 1963. The subsequent discovery of promising antitumor activity among new Cephalotaxus derivatives reported by Chinese, Japanese, and American teams triggered extensive structure elucidation and biological studies in this family. The structural feature of this cephalotaxane family relies mainly on its tetracyclic alkaloid backbone, which comprises an azaspiranic 1-azaspiro[4.4]nonane unit (rings C and D) and a benzazepine ring system (rings A and B), which is linked by its C3 alcohol function to a chiral oxygenated side chain by a carboxylic function alpha to a tetrasubstituted carbon center. The botanical distribution of these alkaloids is limited to the Cephalotaxus genus (Cephalotaxaceae). The scope of biological activities of the Cephalotaxus alkaloids is mainly centered on the antileukemic activity of homoharringtonine (HHT) (2), which in particular demonstrated marked benefits in the treatment of orphan myeloid leukemia and was approved as soon as 2009 by European Medicine Agency and by US Food and Drug Administration in 2012. Its exact mechanism of action was partly elucidated and it was early recognized that HHT (2) inhibited protein synthesis at the level of the ribosome machinery. Interestingly, after a latency period of two decades, the topic of Cephalotaxus alkaloids reemerged as a prolific source of new natural structures. To date, more than 70 compounds have been identified and characterized. Synthetic studies also regained attention during the past two decades, and numerous methodologies were developed to access the first semisynthetic HHT (2) of high purity suitable for clinical studies, and then high grade enantiomerically pure CET (1), HHT (2), and analogs.","Pérard-Viret, Joëlle; Quteishat, Laith; Alsalim, Rana; Royer, Jacques; Dumas, Françoise",Alkaloids Chem Biol,103,1

In the present study, we evaluated the antiviral activities and the mechanism of action of an aqueous extract of Angelica tenuissima Nakai both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, an effective dose of Angelica tenuissima Nakai markedly inhibited the replication of Influenza A virus (PR8), Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Coxsackie virus, and Enterovirus (EV-71) on epithelial (HEK293T/HeLa) and immune (RAW264.7) cells. Such inhibition can be described by the induction of the antiviral state in cells by antiviral, IFNrelated gene induction and secretion of IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vivo, Angelica tenuissima Nakai treated BALB/c mice displayed higher survivability and lower lung viral titers when challenged with lethal doses of highly pathogenic influenza A subtypes (H1N1, H5N2, H7N3, and H9N2). We also found that Angelica tenuissima Nakai can induce the secretion of IL-6, IFN-λ, and local IgA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of Angelica tenuissima Nakai treated mice, which correlating with the observed prophylactic effects. In HPLC analysis, we found the presence of several compounds in the aqueous fraction and among them; we evaluated antiviral properties of ferulic acid.

To allow the diagnosis of COVID-19 infections, several assays based on the real-time PCR technique have been proposed. The requests for diagnosis are such that it was immediately clear that the choice of the most suitable method for each microbiology laboratory had to be based, on the one hand, on the availability of materials, and on the other hand, on the personnel and training priorities for this activity. Unfortunately, due to high demand, the shortage of commercial diagnostic kits has also become a major problem. To overcome these critical issues, we have developed a new qualitative RT-PCR probe. Our system detects three genes—RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N)—and uses the β-actin gene as an endogenous internal control. The results from our assay are in complete agreement with the results obtained using a commercially available kit, except for two samples that did not pass the endogenous internal control. The coincidence rate was 0.96. The LoD of our assay was 140 cp/reaction for N and 14 cp/reaction for RdRp and E. Our kit was designed to be open, either for the nucleic acid extraction step or for the RT-PCR assay, and to be carried out on several instruments. Therefore, it is free from the industrial production logics of closed systems, and conversely, it is hypothetically available for distribution in large quantities to any microbiological laboratory. The kit is currently distributed worldwide (called MOLgen-COVID-19; Adaltis). A new version of the kit for detecting the S gene is also available.","Favaro, Marco; Mattina, Walter; Pistoia, Enrico Salvatore; Gaziano, Roberta; Di Francesco, Paolo; Middleton, Simon; D’Angelo, Silvia; Altarozzi, Tullio; Fontana, Carla",Sci Rep,103,5

Methods and Materials: We retrospectively collected 56 COVID-19 cases from two institutions in Hunan province, China. The basal clinical characteristics, detail imaging features and follow-up CT changes were evaluated and the relationship with the viral load was analyzed. Results: GGO (48, 85.7%) and vascular enlargement (44, 78.6%) were the most frequent signs in COVID-19 patients. Of the lesions, 64.3% of the margins were uneasily differentiated. However, no significant correlations were found in terms of leucocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, and C-reactive protein (all P > 0.05). In contrast, the uneasily differentiated margin was negatively correlated with the Ct value (r = −0.283, P = 0.042), that is, an uneasily differentiated margin indicated a lower Ct value (P = 0.043). Patients with a lower Ct value were likely to present a progress follow-up change (P = 0.022). The Ct value at baseline could predict a progress follow-up change with an AUC of 0.685 (Cut-off value = 29.48). All four patients with normal CT findings presented new lesion(s) on follow-up CT scans. Conclusion: The viral load of COVID-19 is negatively correlated with an uneasily differentiated lesion margin on initial CT scan images and the Ct value should noted when making a diagnosis.

We found that movement between different regions appears to have a relatively small overall effect on the total increase in HIV cases in Kenya. However, the most important consequence of movement patterns was transmission of the disease from high infection to low prevalence areas. Mobility slightly increases HIV incidence rates in regions with initially low HIV prevalences and slightly decreases incidences in regions with initially high HIV prevalence.

As an in-hospital preparation, JZ-1 has been used in Tongji Hospital for many years to treat various infectious diseases of the lower female genital tract, including cervicitis, vaginitis, genital herpes and condyloma acuminatum. Our previous studies have shown that JZ-1 has curative effects on Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis and Ureaplasma urealyticum infections. AIM OF THE STUDY: Genital herpes is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) worldwide and is mainly caused by herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2). Current therapies can relieve symptoms in patients but do not cure or prevent the spread of the virus. This study was designed to investigate the effect of JZ-1 on HSV-2 infection and its mechanism, which is based on autophagy induction, to provide new ideas and a basis for the study of antiviral drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Evaluation of the antiviral activity of JZ-1 was conducted by MTT assay and western blotting. Then, Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, observations through transmission electron microscopy and experiments with the recombinant lentivirus vector mRFP-GFP-LC3B were used to monitor autophagic flux in VK2/E6E7 cells. To explore the mechanism by which JZ-1 regulates autophagy, western blotting and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to determine the expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR pathway proteins and to detect changes in critical molecules in the pathway after the application of a PI3K inhibitor. Additionally, the mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, namely, IL-6, IFN-α, IFN-β and TNF-α, were measured with qRT-PCR. RESULTS: HSV-2 infection inhibited autophagy in the VK2/E6E7 cells. Further study revealed that the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway induced by HSV-2 infection may result in the blocked autophagic flux and inhibited autophagosome and autolysosome formation. JZ-1 exhibited significant antiviral activity in the VK2/E6E7 cells, which showed increased cell vitality and reduced viral protein expression, namely, earliest virus-specific infected cell polypeptides 5 (ICP5) and glycoprotein D (gD). We found that JZ-1 treatment inhibited the upregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway proteins and promoted autophagy to combat HSV-2 infection, while PI3K inhibitor pretreatment prevented the enhanced autophagy induced by JZ-1. Moreover, JZ-1 attenuated the increase in inflammatory cytokines that had been induced HSV-2 infection.

To find predictive effects of cognitive emotion regulation on psychological problems. Methodology: Convenient sampling technique was used to obtain the sample of 500 participants (Male = 239, Female = 261). Research instrument consists of four parts. First part comprised of consent form, second part was about demographic profile, third part was Depression, Anxiety and Stress scale (DASS-21) while Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire was the last part of the instrument. Results: SPSS 23.0 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version was used for study analysis. Descriptive statistics used to summarize the raw data. The inferential statistics such as regression, correlation and t-test were used to calculate the findings according to research objectives. Results indicated that 33%, 40% and 27% individuals were experiencing Depression, Anxiety and Stress respectively during Covid-19 pandemic. Among these participants, 48% (N = 242) were experiencing normal level of all these targeted psychological problems while remaining 52% (N = 258) respondents have mild to very severe level of all these disorders. Furthermore, findings of linear regression analysis illustrated that cognitive emotion regulation significantly predicts psychological problems [R(2)=.216; F = 51.223, p < .01] and 21% variation in psychological problems is due to cognitive emotion regulation. Conclusion: This study recommended that policy makers must develop and implement some necessary programmes to prevent and cure people from devastating psychological and mental health consequences of covid-19 on priority basis.","Riaz, Maryam; Abid, Mueen; Bano, Zaqia",Annals of medicine,103,1

For this reason, it is important to examine studies that address the mental health of parents in order to adapt to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. AIM: To determine the mental health status of parents with children diagnosed with ASD in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study, which is a systematic review, was conducted between December 15, 2020 and December 30, 2020 by scanning articles in English. The Scopus, Science Direct, PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were used for scanning. The keywords COVID-19 AND (“autism” OR “autistic” OR “autism spectrum disorder”) AND parent AND (“mental health” OR “anxiety” OR “stress”) were used in the search process. The inclusion criteria in the study were findings regarding the mental health of parents with children diagnosed with ASD in the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing their anxiety and stress situations, being a research article, and accessing the full text of the article. RESULTS: In the study, a total of 6389 articles were reached, and the full texts of 173 articles were evaluated for eligibility. After the articles excluded by the full-text search were eliminated, 12 studies involving 7105 parents were included in the analysis. The findings obtained from the articles containing data on mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic of parents with children with autism spectrum disorder were discussed in three groups. These were findings on the experiences of parents with children with ASD in the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the areas where parents with children with ASD need support in the COVID-19 pandemic and methods of coping with the COVID-19 pandemic for parents with children with ASD. In the systematic review, it was determined that the anxiety and stress of the parents increased, they needed more support compared to the pre-pandemic period, and they had difficulty coping. CONCLUSION: In this systematic review, it was concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the mental health of the parents of children with ASD.","Yılmaz, Büşra; Azak, Merve; Şahin, Nevin",World J Psychiatry,103,23

Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 antagonist, may have a role as adjunctive immune-modulating therapy. METHODS: This was an observational, retrospective study of hospitalized adult patients with confirmed COVID-19. The intervention group comprised patients who received tocilizumab; the comparator arm was drawn from patients who did not receive tocilizumab. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality censored at 28 days; secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality at discharge, time to clinical improvement, and rates of secondary infections. Marginal structural Cox models via inverse probability treatment weights were applied to estimate the effect of tocilizumab. Time-dependent propensity score matching method was used to generate a 1:1 match for tocilizumab recipients; infectious diseases experts then manually reviewed these matched charts to identify secondary infections. RESULTS: This analysis included 90 tocilizumab recipients and 1669 controls. Under the marginal structural Cox model, tocilizumab was associated with a 62% reduced hazard of death (aHR 0.38, 95% CI: 0.21-0.70) and no change in time to clinical improvement (aHR: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.68-1.87). The 1:1 matched dataset also showed a lower mortality rate (27.8% vs. 34.4%) and reduced hazards of death (aHR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.25-0.88). Elevated inflammatory markers were associated with reduced hazards of death among tocilizumab recipients compared to controls. Secondary infection rates were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab may provide benefit in a subgroup of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who have elevated biomarkers of hyperinflammation, without increasing the risk of secondary infection.","Ignatius, Elisa H; Wang, Kunbo; Karaba, Andrew; Robinson, Matthew; Avery, Robin K; Blair, Paul; Chida, Natasha; Jain, Tania; Petty, Brent G; Siddiqui, Zishan; Melia, Michael T; Auwaerter, Paul G; Xu, Yanxun; Garibaldi, Brian T",Open Forum Infect Dis,103,11

The exact route of virus entry into the blood and CNS invasion has not been clearly defined. The present study was undertaken to assess the population in PBMC that supports the growth of virus and to detect active virus replication in PBMC as well as its subsets. METHODS: PBMC subsets viz.: CD3(+), CD14(+), CD19(+), CD56(+)cells were separated and infected with CHPV. The infected cells were then assessed for transcription (N gene primer) and replication (NP gene primer) of CHPV by PCR. The supernatant collected from infected cells were titrated in Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells to assess virus release. The cytokine and chemokine expression was quantified by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Amplification of N and NP gene was detected in CD14(+) (monocyte) and CD19(+) (B cell), significant increase in virus titre was also observed in these subsets. It was observed that, although the levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were elevated in CD14(+) cells as compared to CD19(+)cells, the differences were not significant. However the levels of TNFα and IL-8 were significantly elevated in CD14(+) cells than in CD19(+)cells. The levels of chemokine (CXCL9, CCL5, CCL2, CXCL10) were significantly elevated in CHPV infected PBMC as compared to uninfected cells. CCL2 and CXCL9 were significantly increased in CHPV infected CD14(+)cells as compared to CD19(+) cells. CONCLUSION: CD14(+)and CD19(+)cells support active replication of CHPV. High viral load was detected in CD14(+) cells infected with CHPV hence it might be the primary target cells for active replication of CHPV. An elevated levels of cytokines and chemokines observed in CD14(+) cells may help in predicting the pathogenecity of CHPV and possible entry into the central nervous system.","Roy, Soumen; Pavitrakar, Daya; Gunjikar, Rashmi; Ayachit, Vijay M.; Bondre, Vijay P.; Sapkal, Gajanan N.",BMC Infect Dis,103,1

We aimed to evaluate the role of chromogenic anti–factor Xa (anti-Xa) assays in the emergency department (ED) in the setting of patients with an acute bleed or requiring emergent procedures. METHODS: A retrospective review of anti-Xa levels obtained in the ED between June 1, 2019, and April 30, 2020, was completed. Data were collected to describe the clinical setting of anti-Xa level collection, oral FXaIs used before admission, administration of reversal agents, and patient disposition to further characterize the role of anti-Xa levels in the management of rivaroxaban and apixaban reversal. RESULTS: Thirty anti-Xa levels were included in the final analysis. The median time from sample collection to anti-Xa assay result was 45.9 minutes (interquartile range, 35.3-54.7 minutes). Eleven patients (37%) received anticoagulation reversal after their anti-Xa levels were determined. Anticoagulation reversal agents included either activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCCs) or prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs). Anti-Xa levels were collected in 2 patients who had received PCCs before arrival at our ED. Of the patients with anti-Xa levels below 30 ng/mL, none received aPCCs or PCCs after their anti-Xa levels were determined. Anti-Xa assays were used to rule out the presence of FXaIs in 3 patients. CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the novel role of anti-Xa levels in managing patients with an emergent need for reversal in the ED. The assay may be used to rule out the presence of oral FXaIs and avoid unnecessary administrations of anticoagulation reversal agents.","Zepeski, Anne E; Faine, Brett A; Merrill, Anna E; Sutamtewagul, Grerk; Bhagavathi, Sharathkumar",Am J Health Syst Pharm,103,24

METHODS: Cardiovascular procedures performed at 30 hospitals across six Western states in two large, non-profit healthcare systems (Providence St. Joseph Health and Stanford Healthcare) from December 2018-June 2020 were analyzed for changes over time. Risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality was compared across pandemic phases with multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 36,125 procedures (69% percutaneous coronary intervention, 13% coronary artery bypass graft surgery, 10% transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and 8% surgical aortic valve replacement), weekly volumes changed in two distinct phases after the initial inflection point on February 23, 2020: an initial period of significant deferral (COVID I: March 15 to April 11) followed by recovery (COVID II: April 12 onwards). Compared to pre-COVID, COVID I patients were less likely to be female (p=0.0003), older (p<0.0001), Asian or Black (p=0.02), or Medicare insured (p<0.0001), and COVID I procedures were higher acuity (p<0.0001), but not higher complexity. In COVID II, there was a trend towards more procedural deferral in regions with a higher COVID-19 burden (p=0.05). Compared to pre-COVID, there were no differences in risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality during both COVID phases. CONCLUSIONS: Significant decreases in cardiovascular procedural volumes occurred early in the COVID-19 pandemic, with disproportionate impacts by race, gender, and age. These findings should inform our approach to future healthcare disruptions.","Yong, Celina M.; Spinelli, Kateri J.; Chiu, Shih Ting; Jones, Brandon; Penny, Brian; Gummidipundi, Santosh; Beach, Shire; Perino, Alex; Turakhia, Mintu; Heidenreich, Paul; Gluckman, Ty J.",Am Heart J,103,1

L’objectif de notre travail était de décrire la présentation clinique, biologique et radiologique des patients de plus de 70 ans hospitalisés dans un service de maladies infectieuses et tropicales d’un ESR métropolitain pour une infection à Sars-CoV-2, et de déterminer le taux de mortalité 4 semaines (S4) après l’admission dans le service. Matériels et méthodes Étude observationnelle monocentrique ayant inclus tous les patients ≥ 70 ans admis dans le service du 01/03 au 15/04/2020, pour un COVID-19 confirmée biologiquement. Critère de jugement principal : statut vital à S4 après l’admission dans le service. Critères de jugement secondaires : durée d’hospitalisation, plus haut débit d’oxygène administré, lieux de vie à S4 pour les survivants, facteurs clinicobiologiques associés au décès à S4. Résultats Cent patients furent inclus pour l’analyse, dont 59 % d’hommes, avec un âge médian (IQR) de 79 ans (74–85). Cinquante-six pour cent avaient un score de Charlson ≥ 5 et 71 % avaient au moins 2 comorbidités [HTA (56 %), insuffisance cardiaque (31 %), démence (25 %), diabète (24 %) et/ou un cancer actif (21 %)]. Onze patients étaient sous immunosuppresseur et/ou corticoïde au long cours. Soixante-dix pour cent étaient admis avant le 7e jour des symptômes, 55 % avaient un score NEWS-2 ≥ 3, et 22 % nécessitaient une oxygénothérapie ≥ 3 litres/min à l’admission. Les symptômes les plus fréquents étaient fièvre (57 %), toux (50 %), dyspnée (36 %) et diarrhée (16 %). Une lymphopénie était présente dans 80 % de cas et une insuffisance rénale aiguë à l’admission dans 32 %. Parmi les 41 patients ayant eu un scanner thoracique, 68 % présentaient une atteinte parenchymateuse modérée à sévère (≥25 %), 57 % une atteinte bilatérale.

The virus spread quickly, particularly in the North of Italy, with three regions (Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna) being the most severely affected. These three regions accounted for >80% of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases when the tight lockdown was established (March 8). These regions include one of Europe's areas of heaviest air pollution, the Po valley. Air pollution has been recently proposed as a possible risk factor of SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to its adverse effect on immunity and to the possibility that polluted air may even carry the virus. We investigated the association between air pollution and subsequent spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection within these regions. We collected NO2 tropospheric levels using satellite data available on the European Space Agency before the lockdown. Using a multivariable restricted cubic spline regression model, we compared NO2 levels with SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence rate at different time points after the lockdown, namely March 8, 22 and April 5, in the 28 provinces of Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna. We found little association of NO2 levels with SARS-CoV-2 prevalence up to about 130 μmol/m2, while a positive association was evident at higher levels at each time point. Notwithstanding the limitations of the use of aggregated data, these findings lend some support to the hypothesis that high levels of air pollution may favor the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Filippini, Tommaso; Rothman, Kenneth J.; Goffi, Alessia; Ferrari, Fabrizio; Maffeis, Giuseppe; Orsini, Nicola; Vinceti, Marco",Sci Total Environ,103,16

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In May 2020, in the midst of work-safe policies in the state and stabilizing COVID-19 case numbers, the Qualtrics-based MiniZ burnout survey was amended to include questions related to COVID-19 and working from home and was emailed to all radiation oncology employees across 3 departments: radiation oncology, radiation physics, and experimental radiation oncology. Descriptive and χ(2) statistics were calculated within Qualtrics using StatIQ to evaluate factors associated with burnout and positive work from home experience. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-five employees completed the survey. Aggregating 3 responses that indicate having some degree of burnout, the rate of burnout across the cohort was 32%. For the same survey questions administered a year earlier, burnout rate was reported to be 40%. In the current survey, radiation oncology faculty and therapists had the highest reported burnout rates, at 47% and 44%, respectively (P = .031). The majority of employees working from home at least part of the time reported the experience was positive (74%, 323/436), and feeling positive about working from home was associated with reduced burnout (P = .030). Qualitative data review suggested the main drivers of unfavorable work-from-home responses were child/family care issues and information technology issues. CONCLUSIONS: Burnout was not increased during the emerging COVID-19 period compared with pre-COVID data. The shift to working from home was positive for most of the workforce and a potential benefit in reducing burnout for many staff groups. Maintaining work-from-home options post COVID-19 may help reduce burnout long term. It is important to personalize options for those unable to work effectively from home and to resolve information technology challenges to ensure functionality.","Hoffman, Karen E.; Garner, Desmond; Koong, Albert C.; Woodward, Wendy A.",Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,103,1

Previously, two critical biological parameters of the pathogen and the host–pathogen interaction—incubation period and broadly protective, relative immunogenicity—were proposed to account for much of the past successes in vaccine development, and to be useful in estimating the “certainty of success” of developing an effective vaccine for viral pathogens for which a vaccine currently does not exist. In considering the “certainty of success” in development of human coronavirus vaccines, particularly SARS-CoV-2, a third, related critical parameter is proposed—infectious inoculum intensity, at an individual-level, and force of infection, at a population-level. Reducing the infectious inoculum intensity (and force of infection, at a population-level) is predicted to lengthen the incubation period, which in turn is predicted to reduce the severity of illness, and increase the opportunity for an anamnestic response upon exposure to the circulating virus. Similarly, successfully implementing individual- and population-based behaviors that reduce the infectious inoculum intensity and force of infection, respectively, while testing and deploying COVID-19 vaccines is predicted to increase the “certainty of success” of demonstrating vaccine efficacy and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease, death, and the pandemic itself.","Kaslow, David C.",NPJ Vaccines,103,30

This collaborative research with the Professional Association of Congolese Midwives (SCOSAF), sought to understand how certain midwives in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have overcome barriers to successfully integrate MVA for post abortion care. Specifically, in order to provide locally-driven solutions to the problem of inadequate post abortion care in the DRC, this study aimed to identify examples of positive deviance, or midwives who had successfully integrated MVA in complex working environments following an in-service training facilitated by their midwifery association, SCOSAF. METHODS: Creswell’s mixed method comparative case study design was used to identify positive deviant midwives who had practiced MVA one or more times post training and to explore their strategies and enabling factors. Other midwives who had not practiced MVA post training permitted for a comparison gro cup and further interpretations. Sources of data included a sequential survey and semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: All 102 midwives invited to be surveyed were recruited and 34% reported practicing MVA post training (positive deviant midwives). No statistical significance was found between the two groups’ demographics and practice facility type. Overall, both groups had positive attitudes regarding midwifery-led MVA and legalization of abortion. Positive deviant midwives demonstrated and described more confidence and competence to practice and teach MVA. They were more likely to identify as teachers and overcome interprofessional barriers by teaching MVA to physicians, medical students and other midwives and position themselves as experts during post abortion emergencies. CONCLUSION: Results provided important insight to midwives’ integration of post abortion care in Kinshasa. Strategies used by positive deviant midwives in emergencies allowed them to navigate challenging contexts in order to practice MVA, while simultaneously increasing the credibility of their profession and the dissemination of evidenced-based MVA practice. Programs designed to work with and promote positive deviant midwives as knowledge brokers could be tested for their overall impact on the diffusion of midwifery-led MVA to improve access to safe, respectful reproductive care.

Given the small genome size, the ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at scale is limited by the cost and labor associated with making sequencing libraries. Here we describe a low-cost, streamlined, all amplicon-based method for sequencing SARS-CoV-2, which bypasses costly and time-consuming library preparation steps.

METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study of patients who received intravitreal injections between April 12th and May 9th, 2020, a period during the national COVID-19 lockdown (March 16th to June 6th, 2020). Special medical and logistic arrangements, priority and visual risk assessment and strict infection control precautions were implemented. Demographics, diagnosis, intravitreal injection history, medical history, ophthalmic examinations and optical coherence tomography data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Intravitreal injections were successfully administered to 132 patients with diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and retinal vein occlusion. All logistic and transmission control measures were followed by the medical staff and patients with no incidents. No new exposures or COVID-19 positive cases were traced to our location or time of therapy. No complications related to the injections were recorded. The mean period of delay due to the lockdown from the original scheduled appointment was six weeks. Mean visual acuity significantly decreased from 20/55 before the lockdown to 20/70 after the lockdown, and mean central macular thickness significantly increased from 329 to 370 μ. CONCLUSION: The administration of intravitreal injection therapy during the COVID-19 lockdown under special safety precautions was feasible and successful. Resumption of the essential therapies and medical services during periods of pandemic restrictions while adhering to strict transmission control measures is encouraged.","Saleh, Omar A; Jammal, Hisham; Alqudah, Noor; Alqudah, Asem; Abu-Yaghi, Nakhleh",Clin Ophthalmol,103,16

In particular, fucoidan, carrageenan, alginate, and chitosan have been extensively investigated in pharmaceutical and biomedical fields owing to their desirable characteristics, such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, and bioactivity. Various therapeutic efficacies of marine polysaccharides have been elucidated, including the inhibition of cancer, inflammation, and viral infection. The therapeutic activities of these polysaccharides have been demonstrated in various settings, from in vitro laboratory-scale experiments to clinical trials. In addition, marine polysaccharides have been exploited for tissue engineering, the immobilization of biomolecules, and stent coating. Their ability to detect and respond to external stimuli, such as pH, temperature, and electric fields, has enabled their use in the design of novel drug delivery systems. Thus, along with the promising characteristics of marine polysaccharides, this review will comprehensively detail their various therapeutic, biomedical, and miscellaneous applications.","Lee, Young-Eun; Kim, Hyeongmin; Seo, Changwon; Park, Taejun; Lee, Kyung Bin; Yoo, Seung-Yup; Hong, Seong-Chul; Kim, Jeong Tae; Lee, Jaehwi",Arch Pharm Res,103,16

The study is innovative in multiple ways. First, it goes beyond the current debate on whether individual- or organisational-level interventions are most effective in improving employee health and well-being and tests the cumulative effects of multilevel interventions, that is, interventions addressing individual, group, leader and organisational levels. Second, it tailors its interventions to address the aftermaths of the Covid-19 pandemic and develop suitable multilevel interventions for dealing with new ways of working. Third, it uses realist evaluation to explore and identify the working ingredients of and the conditions required for each level of intervention, and their outcomes. Finally, an economic evaluation will assess both the cost-effectiveness analysis and the affordability of the interventions from the employer perspective.

The A.23 viral lineage, characterized by three spike mutations F157L, V367F and Q613H, was first identified in a Ugandan prison in July 2020, and then spilled into the general population adding additional spike mutations (R102I, L141F, E484K and P681R) to comprise lineage A.23.1 by September 2020—with this virus being designated a variant of interest (VOI) in Africa and with subsequent spread to 26 other countries. The P681R spike mutation of the A.23.1 VOI is of note as it increases the number of basic residues in the sub-optimal SARS-CoV-2 spike protein furin cleavage site; as such, this mutation may affect viral replication, transmissibility or pathogenic properties. Here, we performed assays using fluorogenic peptides mimicking the S1/S2 sequence from A.23.1 and observed significantly increased cleavability with furin, compared to sequences matching Wuhan-Hu1 S1/S2. We performed functional infectivity assays using pseudotyped MLV particles harboring SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and observed an increase in transduction for A.23.1-pseudotyped particles in Vero-TMPRSS2 and Calu-3 cells, compared to Wuhan-Hu1, and a lowered infection in Vero E6 cells. However, these changes in infectivity were not reproduced in a P681R point mutant of Wuhan-Hu1 spike. Our findings suggest that while A.23.1 has increased furin-mediated cleavage linked to the P681R mutation—which may affect viral infection and transmissibility—this mutation needs to occur on the background of other spike protein changes to enable its functional consequences.","Frazier, Laura E.; Lubinski, Bailey; Tang, Tiffany; Daniel, Susan; Jaimes, Javier A.; Whittaker, Gary R.",bioRxiv,103,1

We have transitioned a staple experiment in most undergraduate microbiology labs, the Bacterial Unknown Project, for online delivery using the university Learning Management System. We maintained the learning objectives suited for online delivery, such as creating an experimental design for identifying an unknown bacterium and communicating scientific results, while replacing or modifying those which could not be replicated, such as demonstration of sterile techniques, with learning objectives that highlighted skills of collaboration, peer evaluation, and scientific communication. Assessment of these new and modified learning objectives demonstrated positive student learning. Additionally, an anonymous postproject survey asked students whether they perceived the online Bacterial Unknown Project had increased their skill level in the areas highlighted by the revised learning objectives. Results reflected that 80% of the students reported the Unknown Project had increased their skills in all areas evaluated.","Amrein, Jennifer; Dimond, Zoe; Reboullet, Julie; Hotze, Eileen",J Microbiol Biol Educ,103,26

Methods A qualitative design with focus group interviews was used to elaborate on the quantitative survey results obtained and analyzed in a previous survey study from the first phase of the Covid-19 pandemic. Five focus groups with seventeen adolescents were conducted digitally during the second pandemic phase in November and December 2020. The interview data were analyzed with directed content analysis. Results The adolescents reported using traditional media and official websites as sources for Covid-19 information. They engaged in preventive behavior, and washing hands and keeping a distance from strangers had become a habit. However, not being physically close to friends felt strange and unpleasant. The measure most frequently discussed was limiting social contact, which was a constant struggle. No one disputed the authorities' guidelines and rules, but the social restrictions caused boredom and despair, particularly due to interrupted schooling and missed opportunities to engage in life events, and freely socialize with friends. Conclusion The adolescents gave an overall impression of being health literate, which corresponds well with the results from our previous survey study. Their descriptions of how they translated protective measures into their everyday lives demonstrate that they took responsibility and accepted personal costs for the collective good. However, life with social restrictions decreased their quality of life.","Riiser, K.; Richardsen, K. R.; Haraldstad, K.; Helseth, S.; Torbjornsen, A.",,103,1

The current studies examine the extent to which this effect could be mediated by social norms – assessed by perceived popularity of foods – which may be implied by their relative availability. Study 1 (Online): 2340 UK adults estimated the perceived popularity of products. Participants were randomised to see photos of cafeteria shelves varying in the availability of lower-energy options ((1)/(4) lower-energy; (1)/(2) lower-energy; (3)/(4) lower-energy) and fullness of shelves (fuller; emptier). Study 2 (Laboratory): 139 English adults were asked to select a snack. Participants were randomised to select from trays varying in the availability of the lower-energy option ((1)/(3) lower-energy; (2)/(3) lower-energy) and fullness of tray (fuller; emptier). In Study 1, evidence for an interaction was found, such that when shelves were fuller, a higher proportion of lower-energy options led to greater perceived popularity of lower-energy products ((1)/(4) lower-energy: 40.9% (95%CIs: 40.1,41.8); (3)/(4) lower-energy: 47.2% (46.3,48.0)), whereas when shelves were emptier, a higher proportion of lower-energy options led to lower perceived popularity ((1)/(4) lower-energy: 48.4% (47.5,49.2); (3)/(4) lower-energy: 39.2% (38.3,40.0)). In Study 2, when the tray was fuller, participants were more likely – albeit non-significantly – to select a lower-energy snack when (2)/(3) of the available snacks were lower-energy (35.7% (18.5,52.9)) than when (1)/(3) were lower-energy (15.4% (4.2,26.5)). For emptier trays, lower-energy selections decreased as the relative availability of lower-energy snacks increased ((1)/(3) lower-energy snacks: 36.0% (17.9,54.1); (2)/(3) lower-energy snacks: 27.8% (13.9,41.7)). These studies provide novel evidence that social norms may mediate the impact of availability on food selection. In addition, they suggest that the effect of availability may be moderated by display layout through its impact on perceived product popularity.","Pechey, Rachel; Clarke, Natasha; Pechey, Emily; Ventsel, Minna; Hollands, Gareth J.; Marteau, Theresa M.",Appetite,103,17

Methods: In this retrospective study, epidemiological and clinical characteristics, complications, laboratory results, and clinical management of the patients were studied from data obtained from 168 individuals diagnosed with an advanced prognosis of COVID-19 admitted in two hospitals in Bangladesh. Results: Individuals in the study sample contracted COVID-19 through community transmission. 56.5% (n = 95) cases died in intensive care units (ICU) during the study period. The median age was 56 years and 79.2% (n=134) were male. Typical clinical manifestation included Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related complications (79.2%), fever (54.2%) and cough (25.6%) while diabetes mellitus (52.4%), hypertension (41.1%) and heart diseases (16.7%) were the conventional comorbidities. Clinical outcomes were detrimental due to comorbidities rather than age and comorbid individuals over 50 were at more risk. In the sample, oxygen saturation was low (< 95% SpO2) in 135 patients (80.4%) and 158 (93.4%) patients received supplemental oxygen. Identical biochemical parameters were found in both deceased and surviving cases. Administration of antiviral drug Remdesivir and the glucocorticoid, Dexamethasone increased the proportion of surviving patients slightly. Conclusions: Susceptibility to developing critical illness due to COVID-19 was found more in comorbid males.

For example, epidemiologists demonstrated 100% prevalence of dental caries in the Russian population followed by clinical manifestation of periodontal diseases. Inadequately provided oral health services in populations are caused by multi-factorial deficits including but not limited to low socio-economic status of affected individuals, lack of insurance in sub-populations, insufficient density of dedicated medical units. Another important aspect is the “participatory” medicine based on the active participation of population in maintaining oral health: healthcare will remain insufficient as long as the patient is not motivated and does not feel responsible for their oral health. To this end, nearly half of chronically diseased people do not comply with adequate medical services suffering from severely progressing pathologies. Noteworthy, the prominent risk factors and comorbidities linked to the severe disease course and poor outcomes in COVID-19-infected individuals, such as elderly, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, are frequently associated with significantly altered oral microbiome profiles, systemic inflammatory processes and poor oral health. Suggested pathomechanisms consider potential preferences in the interaction between the viral particles and the host microbiota including oral cavity, the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Since an aspiration of periodontopathic bacteria induces the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and production of inflammatory cytokines in the lower respiratory tract, poor oral hygiene and periodontal disease have been proposed as leading to COVID-19 aggravation. Consequently, the issue-dedicated expert recommendations are focused on the optimal oral hygiene as being crucial for improved individual outcomes and reduced morbidity under the COVID-19 pandemic condition. Current study demonstrated that age, gender, socio-economic status, quality of environment and life-style, oral hygiene quality, regularity of dental services requested, level of motivation and responsibility for own health status and corresponding behavioural patterns are the key parameters for the patient stratification considering person-tailored approach in a complex dental care in the population. Consequently, innovative screening programmes and adapted treatment schemes are crucial for the complex person-tailored dental care to improve individual outcomes and healthcare provided to the population.","Tachalov, V.

Data Sources A literature search was conducted using 4 databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and AMED Allied and Complementary Medicine, from inception to January 27th, 2021. Study Selection We utilized keywords related to COVID-19, exercise, rehabilitation, and included published athletic return to play after COVID-19 infection and clinical practice guidelines on exercise-based recommendations for COVID-19. Out of 391 published articles, none were related to exercise recommendations and stroke rehabilitation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data Extraction In the absence of stroke-specific guidance, we drew upon pre-COVID clinical practice aerobic exercise guidelines for stroke (n=2) and COVID-19 exercise recommendations for other populations (e.g., athletic [n=6], pulmonary [n=1] and cardiac rehabilitation [n=2]). Data Synthesis Clinical considerations were developed for hospital and out-patient settings to outline safety considerations to reduce the risk of viral transmission and implementation strategies for pre-participation screening, prescription, and progression of aerobic exercise for symptomatic and asymptomatic cases of COVID-19. Based on limited evidence, we suggest that cardiopulmonary exercise stress testing with electrocardiography be conducted following COVID-19 infection and identify subjective and physiological measures to guide decision making regarding the suitability and prescription of aerobic exercise. Finally, we recommend that clinicians and researchers stay abreast with the literature to implement evidence-based practice relating to stroke, aerobic exercise, and COVID-19. Conclusions Using a patient and clinician approach, we have developed COVID-19 specific guidance as a framework for restoring aerobic exercise implementation in stroke rehabilitation settings.

For every minute without resuscitation the likelihood of survival decreases. One critical step is initiation of immediate, high quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The aim of this subgroup analysis of data collected for the European Registry of Cardiac Arrest Study number 2 (EuReCa TWO) was to investigate the association between OHCA survival and two types of bystander CPR namely: chest compression only CPR (CConly) and CPR with chest compressions and ventilations (FullCPR). METHOD: In this subgroup analysis of EuReCa TWO, all patients who received bystander CPR were included. Outcomes were return of spontaneous circulation and survival to 30-days or hospital discharge. A multilevel binary logistic regression analysis with survival as the dependent variable was performed. RESULTS: A total of 5884 patients were included in the analysis, varying between countries from 21 to 1444. Survival was 320 (8%) in the CConly group and 174 (13%) in the FullCPR group. After adjustment for age, sex, location, rhythm, cause, time to scene, witnessed collapse and country, patients who received FullCPR had a significantly higher survival rate when compared to those who received CConly (adjusted odds ration 1.46, 95% confidence interval 1.17-1.83). CONCLUSION: In this analysis, FullCPR was associated with higher survival compared to CConly. Guidelines should continue to emphasise the importance of compressions and ventilations during resuscitation for patients who suffer OHCA and CPR courses should continue to teach both.","Wnent, Jan; Tjelmeland, Ingvild; Lefering, Rolf; Koster, Rudolph W; Maurer, Holger; Masterson, Siobhán; Herlitz, Johan; Böttiger, Bernd W; Ortiz, Fernando Rosell; Perkins, Gavin D; Bossaert, Leo; Moertl, Maximilian; Mols, Pierre; Hadzibegovic, Irzal; Truhlár, Anatolij; Salo, Ari; Baert, Valentine; Nagy, Eniko; Cebula, Grzegorz; Raffay, Violetta; Trenkler, Stefan; Markota, Andrej; Strömsöe, Anneli; Gräsner, Jan-Thorsten",Resuscitation,103,16

The causative agent of the disease, the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, shows important similarities with the previously emerged SARS-CoV-1, but also striking differences. First, SARS-CoV-2 possesses a significantly higher transmission rate and infectivity than SARS-CoV-1 and has infected in a few months over 60 million people. Moreover, COVID-19 has a systemic character, as in addition to the lungs, it also affects the heart, liver, and kidneys among other organs of the patients and causes frequent thrombotic and neurological complications. In fact, the term “viral sepsis” has been recently coined to describe the clinical observations. Here I review current structure–function information on the viral spike proteins and the membrane fusion process to provide plausible explanations for these observations. I hypothesize that several membrane-associated serine proteinases (MASPs), in synergy with or in place of TMPRSS2, contribute to activate the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Relative concentrations of the attachment receptor, ACE2, MASPs, their endogenous inhibitors (the Kunitz-type transmembrane inhibitors, HAI-1/SPINT1 and HAI-2/SPINT2, as well as major circulating serpins) would determine the infection rate of host cells.

As nurses play a crucial role in the process of vaccination, it is important to recognize the attitudes of students of nursing, nurses in spe, toward COVID-19 vaccination, as well as to define the factors influencing students’ pro-vaccine choices. The study was conducted between March and April 2021 at all medical universities in Poland educating nurses in spe. The study included 793 first-degree students from 12 universities. The results revealed that the vast majority of students of nursing (77.2%) were vaccinated against COVID-19, as 61.2% received an mRNA vaccine and 16% a viral vector vaccine. Every other person in the non-vaccinated group declared their intention to get a vaccination. A trend was observed whereby people co-living with persons from the risk group, who are at risk of a severe form of COVID-19, showed greater willingness to get a vaccine. The study results identified the role of universities in increasing the vaccination rate among students, both in terms of education about vaccinations and in shaping pro-vaccine attitudes among students, as well as organizing vaccinations on university campuses to facilitate the process.","Gotlib, Joanna; Sobierajski, Tomasz; Jaworski, Mariusz; Wawrzuta, Dominik; Borowiak, Ewa; Dobrowolska, Beata; Dyk, Danuta; Gaworska-Krzemińska, Aleksandra; Grochans, Elżbieta; Kózka, Maria; Kulik, Halina; Lewko, Jolanta; Nowak-Starz, Grażyna; Wojciechowska, Małgorzata; Uchmanowicz, Izabella; Panczyk, Mariusz",Vaccines (Basel),103,1

While age and comorbid health conditions remain primary concerns in the community-based transmission of the virus, empirical evidence continues to suggest that substantial variability exists in the geographic and geodemographic distribution of COVID-19 infection rates. The purpose of this paper is to provide an alternative, spatiotemporal perspective on the pandemic using the state of Wisconsin as a case study. Specifically, in this paper, we explore the geographic nuances of COVID-19 and its spread in Wisconsin using a suite of spatial statistical approaches. We link detected hot spots of COVID-19 to local geodemographic profiles and the presence of high-risk facilities, including federal and state correctional facilities. The results suggest that the virus disproportionately impacts several communities and geodemographic groups and that proximity to risky facilities correlates to increased community infection rates.","Grubesic, Tony H.; Nelson, Jake R.; Wallace, Danielle; Eason, John; Towers, Sherry; Walker, Jason",GeoJournal,103,19

The lack of prior immunity to COVID-19 has resulted in large numbers of infected patients across the globe and uncertainty regarding management of the complications that arise in the course of this viral illness. The lungs are the target organ for COVID-19; patients develop acute lung injury that can progress to respiratory failure, although multiorgan failure can also occur. The initial coagulopathy of COVID-19 presents with prominent elevation of D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen-degradation products, whereas abnormalities in prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and platelet counts are relatively uncommon in initial presentations. Coagulation test screening, including the measurement of D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, is suggested. COVID-19–associated coagulopathy should be managed as it would be for any critically ill patient, following the established practice of using thromboembolic prophylaxis for critically ill hospitalized patients, and standard supportive care measures for those with sepsis-induced coagulopathy or DIC. Although D-dimer, sepsis physiology, and consumptive coagulopathy are indicators of mortality, current data do not suggest the use of full-intensity anticoagulation doses unless otherwise clinically indicated. Even though there is an associated coagulopathy with COVID-19, bleeding manifestations, even in those with DIC, have not been reported. If bleeding does occur, standard guidelines for the management of DIC and bleeding should be followed.","Connors, Jean M.; Levy, Jerrold H.",Blood,103,16

Multiple approaches have been proposed to speed up vaccine development, including accelerated randomized controlled trials (RCT), controlled human challenge trials (CHI), and wide distribution through an emergency use authorization after collecting initial data. There is a need to examine how best to accelerate vaccine development in the setting of a pandemic, without compromising ethical and scientific norms. Methods Trade-offs in scientific and social value between generating reliable evidence about safety and efficacy while promoting rapid vaccine availability are examined along five ethically relevant dimensions: 1) confidence in and generalizability of data, 2) feasibility, 3) speed and cost, 4) participant risks, and 5) social risks. Results Accelerated individually randomized RCTs permit expeditious evaluation of vaccine candidates using established methods, expertise, and infrastructure. RCTs are more likely than other approaches to be feasible, increase speed and reduce cost, and generate reliable data about safety and efficacy without significantly increasing risks to participants or undermining societal trust. Conclusion Ethical analysis suggests that accelerated RCTs are the best approach to accelerating vaccine development in a pandemic, and more likely than other approaches to enhance social value without compromising ethics or science. RCTs can expeditiously collect rigorous data about vaccine safety and efficacy. Innovative and flexible designs and implementation strategies to respond to shifting incidence and test vaccine candidates in parallel or sequentially would add value, as will coordinated data sharing across vaccine trials. CHI studies may be an important complementary strategy when more is known. Widely disseminating a vaccine candidate without efficacy data will not serve the public health nor achieve the goal of identifying safe and effective SARS Co-V 2 vaccines.","Grady, Christine; Shah, Seema; Miller, Franklin; Danis, Marion; Nicolini, Marie; Ochoa, Jorge; Taylor, Holly; Wendler, Dave; Rid, Annette",Vaccine,103,20

Currently, no effective vaccines, Food and Drug Administration-approved inhibitors, or other therapeutic intervention options are available against VHSV. α-Lipoic Acid (LA), a potent antioxidant, has been proposed to have antiviral effects against different viruses. In this study, LA (CC(50) = 472.6 μmol/L) was repurposed to exhibit antiviral activity against VHSV. In fathead minnow cells, LA significantly increased the cell viability post-VHSV infection (EC(50) = 42.7 μmol/L), and exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on VHSV induced-plaque, cytopathic effects, and VHSV glycoprotein expression. The time-of-addition assay suggested that the antiviral activity of LA occurred at viral replication stage. Survival assay revealed that LA could significantly upregulated the survival rate of VHSV-infected largemouth bass in both co-injection (38.095% vs. 1.887%, P < 0.01) and post-injection manner (38.813% vs. 8.696%, P < 0.01) compared with the control group. Additional comparative transcriptome and qRT-PCR analysis revealed LA treatment upregulated the expression of several antiviral genes, such as IRF7, Viperin, and ISG15. Moreover, LA treatment reduced VHSV-induced reactive oxygen species production in addition to Nrf2 and SOD1 expression. Taken together, these data demonstrated that LA suppressed VHSV replication by inducing antiviral genes expression and reducing VHSV-induced oxidative stress. These results suggest a new direction in the development of potential antiviral candidate drugs against VHSV infection.

It is not a fully understood disease with genetic and epigenetic susceptibility and about 80% substantial heritability. The CUB and Sushi multiple domains 1 (CSMD1) gene is implicated in neurogenesis, memory, immunity, neuropsychology, and monoamine metabolism. Thus, it is one of the powerful genes involved in the pathogenesis of SCZ. Purpose: To evaluate the possible role of the CSMD1 gene’s mRNA expression and its serum protein as markers for the early diagnosis of the first-episode SCZ in familial high-risk (FHR) Egyptian children and young adults. Subjects and methods: This case–control study included 80 first-episode drug-naïve SCZ patients from FHR Egyptian children and young adults and 80 healthy participants, as controls, from the FHR-susceptible children and young adults but did not develop SCZ. In this study, the CSMD1 gene’s mRNA expression and CSMD1 serum levels were measured in the peripheral blood, and these levels were correlated with the lipid profile of the study populations. Results: The CSMD1 gene’s mRNA expression and its’ protein levels were significantly decreased in the SCZ patients compared to controls. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis succeeded in distinguishing SCZ patients from those not having SCZ using cutoff points of ≤0.711 and ≤4.83 ng/mL for the CSMD1 gene’s mRNA expression and serum protein level, respectively. At these levels, the diagnostic sensitivities were 93.75 and 91.25%; specificity was 92.5%; positive predictive value (PPV) were 92.6 and 92.4%; and negative predictive values (NPVs) were 93.7 and 91.4%, respectively. Also, the ROC curve analysis succeeded in discriminating those with suicidal tendencies. Conclusion: CSMD1 gene’s mRNA expression might be a reliable and early diagnostic predictor of first-episode SCZ in the FHR Egyptian children and young adults.","Abd El Gayed, Eman Masoud; Rizk, Mohamed Soliman; Ramadan, Ahmed Nabil; Bayomy, Noha Rabie",ACS Omega,103,2

However, disability-related logistical issues and uneven geographical coverage of healthcare services may prevent MND patients from accessing neuropsychological evaluations. This study thus aimed to standardize for the Italian population the ALS Cognitive Behavioral Screen-Phone Version (ALS-CBS™-PhV), an MND-specific, telephone-based screening for frontotemporal dysfunction. METHODS: The cognitive section of the ALS-CBS™-PhV, the Italian telephone-based Mini-Mental State Examination (Itel-MMSE), and the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) was administered to 359 healthy individuals (143 males, 216 females; age, 52.7 ± 15.8; education, 13.1 ± 4.4). Norms were derived through equivalent scores. Validity, factorial structure, reliability, diagnostic accuracy, and item difficulty and discrimination were examined. Statistical equivalence between the telephone-based and in-person versions was tested. RESULTS: ALS-CBS™-PhV measures were predicted by age and education. The ALS-CBS™-PhV reflected a mono-component structure, converged with Itel-MMSE and TICS scores (r(s) = .23–.51) and was equivalent to its in-person format (t = .37; p = .72). Good internal (Cronbach’s α = .61), test–retest (ICC = .69), and inter-rater (ICC = .96) reliability was detected. High accuracy was found when tested against both the Itel-MMSE and the TICS (AUC = .82–89). Backward digit span items were the most discriminative. DISCUSSION: The ALS-CBS™-PhV is a statistically solid screening test for frontotemporal disorders featuring MND. Its standardization allows for (1) improvements in tele-healthcare for MND patients, (2) epidemiological applications, and (3) effective assessments in decentralized clinical trials. The ALS-CBS™-PhV can be also suitable for assessing bedridden and visually impaired patients with motor disorders.","Aiello, Edoardo Nicolò; Esposito, Antonella; Giannone, Ilaria; Diana, Lorenzo; Woolley, Susan; Murphy, Jennifer; Christodoulou, Georgia; Tremolizzo, Lucio; Bolognini, Nadia; Appollonio, Ildebrando",Neurol Sci,103,1

No data regarding the use of neuromonitoring tools in this group of patients are available. Methods: This is a retrospective study of prospectively collected data. The primary aim was to assess the incidence and the type of neurological complications in critically ill COVID-19 patients and their effect on survival as well as on hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. The secondary aim was to describe cerebral hemodynamic changes detected by noninvasive neuromonitoring modalities such as transcranial Doppler, optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), and automated pupillometry. Results: Ninety-four patients with COVID-19 admitted to an ICU from February 28 to June 30, 2020, were included in this study. Fifty-three patients underwent noninvasive neuromonitoring. Neurological complications were detected in 50% of patients, with delirium as the most common manifestation. Patients with neurological complications, compared to those without, had longer hospital (36.8 ± 25.1 vs. 19.4 ± 16.9 days, p < 0.001) and ICU (31.5 ± 22.6 vs. 11.5±10.1 days, p < 0.001) stay. The duration of mechanical ventilation was independently associated with the risk of developing neurological complications (odds ratio 1.100, 95% CI 1.046–1.175, p = 0.001). Patients with increased intracranial pressure measured by ONSD (19% of the overall population) had longer ICU stay.

METHODS: Data were from the 8th wave of the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (2016/17), stratified by age (n = 1578 aged <65; n = 4026 aged 65+). Inverse probability weighting was used to estimate average effects of weekly in-person and remote social contact on depressive symptoms (score of 3+ on 8-item CES-D scale) and two measures of loneliness (sometimes/often feels lonely vs hardly ever/never; and top quintile of UCLA loneliness scale vs all others). We also estimated controlled direct effects of education, partner status, and wealth on loneliness and depressive symptoms under two scenarios: 1) universal infrequent (<weekly) in-person social contact; and 2) universal weekly remote social contact. RESULTS: Weekly in-person social contact was associated on average with reduced odds of loneliness, but associations with remote social contact were weak. Lower education raised odds of depressive symptoms and loneliness, but differences were attenuated with infrequent in-person contact. Respondents living alone experienced more depressive symptoms and loneliness than those living with a partner, and less wealth was associated with more depressive symptoms. With universal infrequent in-person contact, these differences narrowed among those aged under 65 but widened among those aged 65+. Universal weekly remote contact had relatively little impact on inequalities. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced in-person social contact may increase depressive symptoms and loneliness among older adults, especially for those aged 65+ who live alone. Reliance on remote social contact seems unlikely to compensate for social inequalities.","Green, Michael J.; Whitley, Elise; Niedzwiedz, Claire L.; Shaw, Richard J.; Katikireddi, S.

These cultures were infected at the apical side with one of two different SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Each virus was shown to replicate to high titers for extended periods of time (at least 8 days) and, in particular an isolate with the D614G in the spike (S) protein did so more efficiently at 35°C than 37°C.

It remains unknown about small area-based spatiotemporal patterns of COVID-19 in the United States. METHODS: We obtained county-based counts of COVID-19 cases confirmed in the United States from January 22 to May 13, 2020 (N=1,386,050). We characterized the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic through detecting weekly hotspots of newly confirmed cases using Spatial and Space-Time Scan Statistics and quantifying the trends of incidence of COVID-19 by county characteristics using the Joinpoint analysis. RESULTS: Along with the national plateau reached in early April, COVID-19 incidence significantly decreased in the Northeast (estimated weekly percentage changes [EWPC]: -16.6%), but remained increasing in the Midwest, South and West Regions (EWPCs: 13.2%, 5.6%, and 5.7%, respectively). Higher risks of clustering and incidence of COVID-19 were consistently observed in metropolitan vs rural counties, counties closest to core airports, most populous counties, and counties with highest proportion of racial/ethnic minority counties. However, geographic differences in the incidence have shrunk since early April, driven by a significant decrease in the incidence in these counties (EWPC range: -2.0% – -4.2%) and a consistent increase in other areas (EWPC range: 1.5% – 20.3%). CONCLUSIONS: To substantially decrease the nationwide incidence of COVID-19, strict social distancing measures should be continuously implemented, especially in geographic areas with increasing risks, including rural areas. Spatiotemporal characteristics and trends of COVID-19 should be considered in decision-making on the timeline of re-opening for states and localities.","Wang, Yun; Liu, Ying; Struthers, James; Lian, Min",Clin Infect Dis,103,9

Here, we review the literature to date of the short-term and long-term consequences of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on the heart. RECENT FINDINGS: Early case reports described a spectrum of cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19, including myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmia. However, in most cases, myocardial injury in COVID-19 appears to be predominantly mediated by the severity of critical illness rather than direct injury to myocardium from viral particles. While cardiac magnetic resonance imaging remains a powerful tool for diagnosing acute myocarditis, it should be used judiciously in light of low baseline prevalence of myocarditis. Guiding an athletic patient through return to play (RTP) after COVID-19 infection is a challenging process. More recent data show RTP has been a safe endeavor using a screening protocol. “Long COVID” or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection has also been described. The reported symptoms span a large breadth of cardiopulmonary and neurologic complaints including fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, breathlessness, brain fog, and dysautonomia including postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Management of POTS/dysautonomia primarily centers on education, exercise, and salt and fluid repletion. SUMMARY: Our understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system is constantly evolving. As we enter a new age of survivorship, additional research is needed to catalogue the burden of persistent cardiopulmonary symptoms. Research is also needed to learn how acute management may alter the likelihood and prevalence of this chronic syndrome.","Chilazi, Michael; Duffy, Eamon Y.; Thakkar, Aarti; Michos, Erin D.",Curr Atheroscler Rep,103,32

Even with the development of effective vaccines, this coronavirus pandemic continues to cause a fervor with the identification of major new variants hailing from the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, and California. Coupled with worries over a distinct mink strain that has caused human infections and potential for further mutations, SARS-CoV-2 variants bring concerns for increased spread and escape from both vaccine and natural infection immunity. Here, we outline factors driving SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution, explore the potential impact of specific mutations, examine the risk of further mutations, and consider the experimental studies needed to understand the threat these variants pose.","Plante, Jessica A.; Mitchell, Brooke M.; Plante, Kenneth S.; Debbink, Kari; Weaver, Scott C.; Menachery, Vineet D.",Cell Host Microbe,103,1

However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, people were advised and even forced by governments to stay home and avoid social contact to slow down the spreading of the virus. The major LBG developers reacted by making in-game adjustments that allow playing from home, while still maintaining some incentives for players to go outdoors and socialise. For investigating factors influencing intention to play LBGs socially during the on-going pandemic, we collected cross-sectional survey data (N=855) from Finnish players of the most popular LBG, Pokémon GO. The results showed that perceived severity of the pandemic and a positive attitude towards both governmental measures and in-game changes for combatting COVID-19 predicted intention to reduce social playing. Fear of missing out and deficient self-regulation increased playing intensity, which in turn negatively correlated with the intention to reduce social playing. Our findings demonstrate the influence that LBGs can have on human behaviour even during global crises such as COVID-19. As such, LBGs can be considered a resource in designing interventions for influencing movement at a population level.","Laato, Samuli; Najmul Islam, A.K.M.; Laine, Teemu H",,103,1

Since smoking tobacco affects and damages the lungs, it increases the risk of respiratory infections and makes it easier for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to invade the lung tissue, causing more severe symptoms and increasing the risk of death. However, debates are still ongoing as to the effect of cigarette smoking on vulnerability to COVID-19. Some studies, where active smokers were underrepresented among patients with COVID-19, claimed that a “smoker’s paradox” may exist in COVID-19 and that smokers are protected from infection and severe complications of COVID-19. However, other studies reported the opposite trend. The objective of this study is to review the findings of epidemiological and in vitro studies about the association between smoking and the risk of contracting COVID-19, taking into account disease severity. Several epidemiological studies have found a higher smoking prevalence among COVID-19 infected patients. Also, studies had shown that people with respiratory diseases caused by tobacco use are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms. Studies have shown that in vitro, the acute exposure allows for more severe proximal airway epithelial disease from SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the mucosal innate immune response and the proliferation of airway basal stem cells and has implications for disease spread and severity in people exposed to cigarette smoke, with a more severe viral infection and cell death. Smoker patients with different comorbidities are at higher risk of contracting the COVID-19 virus and have a worse prognosis for the virus as well as for their comorbidities. Further investigations of the interaction between smoking and COVID-19 are warranted to accurately assess the risk of contracting COVID-19 among smokers, and the progression to mechanical ventilation or death in patients who suffer from it.","Haddad, Chadia; Bou Malhab, Sandrella; Sacre, Hala; Salameh, Pascale",Tob Use Insights,103,24

The virus responsible for the disease, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), enters host cells by means of the envelope spike protein, which binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors. These receptors are highly expressed in heart, lungs, respiratory tract epithelium, endothelial cells and brain. Since an increasing body of significant evidence is highlighting a possible neuroinvasion related to SARS-CoV-2, a state of the art on the neurological complications is needed. To identify suitable publications, our systematic review was carried out by searching relevant studies on PubMed and Scopus databases. We included studies investigating neurologic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 in patients over 18. According to the analyzed studies, the most frequent disorders affecting central nervous system (CNS) seem to be the following: olfactory and taste disorders, ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke, meningoencephalitis and encephalopathy, including acute necrotizing encephalopathy, a rare type of encephalopathy. As regards the peripheral nervous system (PNS), Guillain-Barré and Miller Fisher syndromes are the most frequent manifestations reported in the literature. Important clinical information on the neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 would help clinicians raise awareness and simultaneously improve the prognosis of critically ill patients.","Orrù, Graziella; Conversano, Ciro; Malloggi, Eleonora; Francesconi, Francesca; Ciacchini, Rebecca; Gemignani, Angelo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,103,30

In COVID-19 pandemic era, several factors can provoke mental issues of people and patients. In this cross-sectional study, we aim to estimate the new prevalence of anxious and depressive symptoms and their relating factors in PWMS. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we include PWMS who are recruited in the MS clinic of Sina Hospital, Tehran, and are joined in our channel of Telegram media. A self-designed online questionnaire consisted of 4 parts handed out between patients: demographic and clinical data, Beck depression inventory, Beck anxiety inventory, and Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to find the relating factors of expression of depressive and anxious symptoms in PWMS. RESULTS: Of a total of 282 participants with the mean age of 35.66 (30.75–40) years, had been suffering from multiple sclerosis for 7.36 (3–10) years, 81.7% were women and 69.1% classified as relapsing–remitting MS. Mean score of BDI was 17.13 ± 11.51 which is classified as minimal-moderate depressive symptoms. 48.6% of patients did not express depressive symptoms (BDI-II ≤ 14) and the others reported some degrees of depression. In the univariate analysis employment (p = 0.015), marital status (p = 0.022), level of education (p = 0.004), number of hospitalization due to MS attacks (p = 0.048), and fear of COVID-19 (p ≤ 0.0001) associated significantly with presence of depressive symptoms. After entering these factors in a binary logistic regression model, level of education (p = 0.019), marital status (p = 0.044), number of hospital admissions due to MS relapses (β = 1.10, p = 0.02), and fear of COVID-19 (β = 1.07, p ≤ 0001) remained significant as relating factors. Mean score of the anxiety calculated 14.54 ± 9.75 and just 3.2% of patients had severe anxiety. Employment (p = 0.045), EDSS score (p = 0.004), and fear of COVID-19 (p ≤ 0.0001) reported relating to anxious symptoms significantly in the univariate analysis. After entering in the logistic regression analysis, EDSS (β = 1.30, p = 0.001) and fear of COVID-19 (β = 1.13, p ≤ 0.0001) remained as significant relating factors of anxious symptoms. CONCLUSION: The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms in PWMS in our MS clinic is 51.4% which is obviously higher than other world’s centers which could be due to fear of COVID-19. In addition to fear of COVID-19, presence of depressive symptoms in PWMS is related significantly with level of education, number of hospital admissions due to MS relapses, and marital status. Other side, the patients classified as suffering from anxious symptoms had more severe problems on fear of COVID-19. But it is recommended for future studies to compare patients score in the COVID-19 era with their score before this pandemic.","Alirezaei, Mohammad; Eskandarieh, Sharareh; Sahraian, Mohammad Ali; Naser Moghadasi, Abdorreza",Neurol Sci,103,32

Little, however, is known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sustainable supplier selection particularly in the manufacturing sector. In this paper, we present pandemic response strategies as a significant aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact and investigate the relative importance of such strategies in SSS implementation. Drawing upon a rich data pool from the Nigerian manufacturing sector, we proposed an integrated multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methodology to analyse the interrelationships between the COVID-19 pandemic response strategies and Triple-Bottom-Line (TBL) criteria for SSS. Our analysis shows that economic criteria and pandemic response strategies are the highest ranked in terms of relative importance and thereby pinpoints the need for manufacturing firms to emphasize such during SSS implementation in the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, quality, cost, use of personal protective equipment and use of information technologies for customer demand prediction are inferred as highly significant in SSS implementation in the COVID-19 pandemic era. Furthermore, the efficiency of the proposed methodology was validated by a comparative analysis with other MCDM methods. Therefore, this study presents implications on the significance of pandemic response strategies in SSS and thereby enriches literature on the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on supply chains.","Orji, Ifeyinwa Juliet; Ojadi, Frank",Comput Ind Eng,103,23

This review aims to summarize and discuss the recent advances concerning the clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 associated cranial nerve mononeuropathies or polyneuropathies. Therefore, a systematic review of articles from PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted. Altogether 36 articles regarding SARS-CoV-2 associated neuropathy of cranial nerves describing 56 patients were retrieved. Out of these 56 patients, cranial nerves were compromised without the involvement of peripheral nerves in 32 of the patients, while Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) with cranial nerve involvement was described in 24 patients. A single cranial nerve was involved either unilaterally or bilaterally in 36 patients, while in 19 patients multiple cranial nerves were involved. Bilateral involvement was more prevalent in the GBS group (n=11) as compared to the cohort with isolated cranial nerve involvement (n=5). Treatment of cranial nerve neuropathy included steroids (n=18), intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) (n=18), acyclovir/valacyclovir (n=3), and plasma exchange (n=1). The outcome was classified as ""complete recovery"" in 21 patients and as ""partial recovery"" in 30 patients. One patient had a lethal outcome. In conclusion, any cranial nerve can be involved in COVID-19, but cranial nerves VII, VI, and III are the most frequently affected. The involvement of cranial nerves in COVID-19 may or may not be associated with GBS. In patients with cranial nerve involvement, COVID-19 infections are usually mild. Isolated cranial nerve palsy without GBS usually responds favorably to steroids. Cranial nerve involvement with GBS benefits from IVIG.","Finsterer, Josef; Scorza, Fulvio Alexandre; Scorza, Carla; Fiorini, Ana",Bosn. j. basic med. sci. (Print),103,32

AIMS: To report on the gastrointestinal manifestations and pathological findings of patients with COVID‐19, and to discuss the possibility of faecal transmission. METHODS: We have reviewed gastrointestinal features of, and faecal test results in, COVID‐19 from case reports and retrospective clinical studies relating to the digestive system published since the outbreak. RESULTS: With an incidence of 3% (1/41)‐79% (159/201), gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID‐19 included anorexia 39.9% (55/138)‐50.2% (101/201), diarrhoea 2% (2/99)‐49.5% (146/295), vomiting 3.6% (5/138)‐66.7% (4/6), nausea 1% (1/99)‐29.4% (59/201), abdominal pain 2.2% (3/138)‐6.0% (12/201) and gastrointestinal bleeding 4% (2/52)‐13.7% (10/73). Diarrhoea was the most common gastrointestinal symptom in children and adults, with a mean duration of 4.1 ± 2.5 days, and was observed before and after diagnosis. Vomiting was more prominent in children. About 3.6% (5/138)‐15.9% (32/201) of adult and 6.5% (2/31)‐66.7% (4/6) of children patients presented vomiting. Adult and children patients can present with digestive symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms. The incidence of digestive manifestations was higher in the later than in the early stage of the epidemic, but no differences in digestive symptoms among different regions were found. Among the group of patients with a higher proportion of severe cases, the proportion of gastrointestinal symptoms in severe patients was higher than that in nonsevere patients (anorexia 66.7% vs 30.4%; abdominal pain 8.3% vs 0%); while in the group of patients with a lower severe rate, the proportion with gastrointestinal symptoms was similar in severe and nonsevere cases (nausea and vomiting 6.9% vs 4.6%; diarrhoea 5.8% vs 3.5%). Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and virus nucleocapsid protein were detected in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and infectious virus particles were isolated from faeces. Faecal PCR testing was as accurate as respiratory specimen PCR detection. In 36% (5/14)‐53% (39/73) faecal PCR became positive, 2‐5 days later than sputum PCR positive. Faecal excretion persisted after sputum excretion in 23% (17/73)‐82% (54/66) patients for 1‐11 days. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with COVID‐19, and had an increased prevalence in the later stage of the recent epidemic in China.

Adding the human dimension makes for better decisions by casting light on how people might respond to otherwise rational policy proposals. It is not sufficient for good policy outcomes that economists confer only with their professional peers. Citizens must be persuaded that the proposed policy reform is in the best interests of the community as a whole.

There is limited research on how public health policies have been implemented or what has influenced their implementation. This paper explores policy implementation in two exemplar public health programs -chronic disease prevention and sexually-transmitted infection prevention - in Ontario, Canada. It examines public health service providers’, managers’ and senior managements’ perspectives on the process of implementation of the Ontario Public Health Standards 2008 and factors influencing implementation. METHODS: Public health staff from six health units representing rural, remote, large and small urban settings were included. We conducted 21 focus groups and 18 interviews between 2010 (manager and staff focus groups) and 2011 (senior management interviews) involving 133 participants. Research assistants coded transcripts and researchers reviewed these; the research team discussed and resolved discrepancies. To facilitate a breadth of perspectives, several team members helped interpret the findings. An integrated knowledge translation approach was used, reflected by the inclusion of academics as well as decision-makers on the team and as co-authors. RESULTS: Front line service providers often were unaware of the new policies but managers and senior management incorporated them in operational and program planning. Some participants were involved in policy development or provided feedback prior to their launch. Implementation was influenced by many factors that aligned with Greenhalgh and colleagues’ empirically-based Diffusion of Innovations in Service Organizations Framework. Factors and related components that were most clearly linked to the OPHS policy implementation were: attributes of the innovation itself; adoption by individuals; diffusion and dissemination;the outer context – interorganizational networks and collaboration; the inner setting – implementation processes and routinization; and, linkage at the design and implementation stage. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors influenced public health policy implementation. Results provide empirical support for components of Greenhalgh et al’s framework and suggest two additional components – the role of external organizational collaborations and partnerships as well as planning processes in influencing implementation. These are important to consider by government and public health organizations when promoting new or revised public health policies as they evolve over time. A successful policy implementation process in Ontario has helped to move public health towards the new vision.

For many, this approach was adopted out of necessity, rather than choice, thus presenting a true ‘testing ground’ for remote healthcare and a robust evaluation on a national and representative level. OBJECTIVE: To extract and analyse mental health specific data from a national dataset for 1 year (March 2020–March 2021). DESIGN: A mixed-methods study using surveys and interviews. SETTING: In NHS mental health services in Wales, UK. PARTICIPANTS: With NHS patients and clinicians across child and adolescent, adult and older adult mental health services. OUTCOME MEASURES: Mixed methods data captured measures on use, value, benefits and challenges of video consulting (VC). RESULTS: A total of 3561 participants provided mental health specific data. These data and its findings demonstrate that remote mental health service delivery, via the method of VC is highly satisfactory, well-accepted and clinically suitable for many patients, and provides a range of benefits to NHS patients and clinicians. Interestingly, clinicians working from ‘home’ rated VC more positively compared with those at their ‘clinical base’. CONCLUSIONS: Post 1-year adoption, remote mental health services in Wales UK have demonstrated that VC is possible from both a technical and behavioural standpoint. Moving forward, we suggest clinical leaders and government support to sustain this approach ‘by default’ as an option for NHS appointments.","Johns, Gemma; Burhouse, Anna; Tan, Jacinta; John, Oliver; Khalil, Sara; Williams, Jessica; Whistance, Bethan; Ogonovsky, Mike; Ahuja, Alka",BMJ Open,103,14

Objective To provide a contemporary picture of the risks from delayed treatment for urologic cancers to assist with triage. Evidence acquisition A collaborative review using literature published as of April 2, 2020. Evidence synthesis Patients with low-grade non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer are unlikely to suffer from a 3–6-month delay. Patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer are at risk of disease progression, with radical cystectomy delays beyond 12 wk from diagnosis or completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Prioritization of these patients for surgery or management with radiochemotherapy is encouraged. Active surveillance should be used for low-risk prostate cancer (PCa). Treatment of most patients with intermediate- and high-risk PCa can be deferred 3–6 mo without change in outcomes. The same may be true for cancers with the highest risk of progression. With radiotherapy, neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of care. For surgery, although the added value of neoadjuvant ADT is questionable, it may be considered if a patient is interested in such an approach. Intervention may be safely deferred for T1/T2 renal masses, while locally advanced renal tumors (≥T3) should be treated expeditiously. Patients with metastatic renal cancer may consider vascular endothelial growth factor targeted therapy over immunotherapy. Risks for delay in the treatment of upper tract urothelial cancer depend on grade and stage. For patients with high-grade disease, delays of 12 wk in nephroureterectomy are not associated with adverse survival outcomes. Expert guidance recommends expedient local treatment of testis cancer. In penile cancer, adverse outcomes have been observed with delays of ≥3 mo before inguinal lymphadenectomy. Limitations include a paucity of data and methodologic variations for many cancers. Conclusions Patients and clinicians should consider the oncologic risk of delayed cancer intervention versus the risks of COVID-19 to the patient, treating health care professionals, and the health care system. Patient summary The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to delays in the treatment of patients with urologic malignancies. Based on a review of the literature, patients with high-grade urothelial carcinoma, advanced kidney cancer, testicular cancer, and penile cancer should be prioritized for treatment during these challenging times.","Wallis, Christopher J.D.; Novara, Giacomo; Marandino, Laura; Bex, Axel; Kamat, Ashish M.; Karnes, R.
