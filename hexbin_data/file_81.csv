127,Clinical review: Update of avian influenza A infections in humans,2007-03-22,"Influenza A viruses have a wide host range for infection, from wild waterfowl to poultry to humans. Recently, the cross-species transmission of avian influenza A, particularly subtype H5N1, has highlighted the importance of the non-human subtypes and their incidence in the human population has increased over the past decade. During cross-species transmission, human disease can range from the asymptomatic to mild conjunctivitis to fulminant pneumonia and death. With these cases, however, the risk for genetic change and development of a novel virus increases, heightening the need for public health and hospital measures. This review discusses the epidemiology, host range, human disease, outcome, treatment, and prevention of cross-transmission of avian influenza A into humans.","Sandrock, Christian; Kelly, Terra",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2206439/,81
262,Cytomegalovirus infection in critically ill patients: a systematic review,2009-05-14,"INTRODUCTION: The precise role of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in contributing to outcomes in critically ill immunocompetent patients has not been fully defined. METHODS: Studies in which critically ill immunocompetent adults were monitored for CMV infection in the intensive care unit (ICU) were reviewed. RESULTS: CMV infection occurs in 0 to 36% of critically ill patients, mostly between 4 and 12 days after ICU admission. Potential risk factors for CMV infection include sepsis, requirement of mechanical ventilation, and transfusions. Prolonged mechanical ventilation (21 to 39 days vs. 13 to 24 days) and duration of ICU stay (33 to 69 days vs. 22 to 48 days) correlated significantly with a higher risk of CMV infection. Mortality rates in patients with CMV infection were higher in some but not all studies. Whether CMV produces febrile syndrome or end-organ disease directly in these patients is not known. CONCLUSIONS: CMV infection frequently occurs in critically ill immunocompetent patients and may be associated with poor outcomes. Further studies are warranted to identify subsets of patients who are likely to develop CMV infection and to determine the impact of antiviral agents on clinically meaningful outcomes in these patients.","Osawa, Ryosuke; Singh, Nina",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2717427/,81

670,Clinical Review: Gene-based therapies for ALI/ARDS: where are we now?,2011-06-20,"Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) confer substantial morbidity and mortality, and have no specific therapy. The accessibility of the distal lung epithelium via the airway route, and the relatively transient nature of ALI/ARDS, suggest that the disease may be amenable to gene-based therapies. Ongoing advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of ALI/ARDS have revealed multiple therapeutic targets for gene-based approaches. Strategies to enhance or restore lung epithelial and/or endothelial cell function, to strengthen lung defense mechanisms against injury, to speed clearance of infection and to enhance the repair process following ALI/ARDS have all demonstrated promise in preclinical models. Despite three decades of gene therapy research, however, the clinical potential for gene-based approaches to lung diseases including ALI/ARDS remains to be realized. Multiple barriers to effective pulmonary gene therapy exist, including the pulmonary architecture, pulmonary defense mechanisms against inhaled particles, the immunogenicity of viral vectors and the poor transfection efficiency of nonviral delivery methods. Deficits remain in our knowledge regarding the optimal molecular targets for gene-based approaches. Encouragingly, recent progress in overcoming these barriers offers hope for the successful translation of gene-based approaches for ALI/ARDS to the clinical setting.","Devaney, James; Contreras, Maya; Laffey, John G",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3218971/,81

790,Superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation combined with continuous positive airway pressure/assisted spontaneous breathing improves oxygenation in patients with H1N1-associated ARDS,2012-03-06,"BACKGROUND: Numerous cases of swine-origin 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus (H1N1)-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) bridged by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy have been reported; however, complication rates are high. We present our experience with H1N1-associated ARDS and successful bridging of lung function using superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation (SHFJV) in combination with continuous positive airway pressure/assisted spontaneous breathing (CPAP/ASB). METHODS: We admitted five patients with H1N1 infection and ARDS to our intensive care unit. Although all patients required pure oxygen and controlled ventilation, oxygenation was insufficient. We applied SHFJV/CPAP/ASB to improve oxygenation. RESULTS: Initial PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio prior SHFJV was 58-79 mmHg. In all patients, successful oxygenation was achieved by SHFJV (PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio 105-306 mmHg within 24 h). Spontaneous breathing was set during first hours after admission. SHFJV could be stopped after 39, 40, 72, 100, or 240 h. Concomitant pulmonary herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection was observed in all patients. Two patients were successfully discharged. The other three patients relapsed and died within 7 weeks mainly due to combined HSV infection and in two cases reoccurring H1N1 infection. CONCLUSIONS: SHFJV represents an alternative to bridge lung function successfully and improve oxygenation in the critically ill.","Bingold, Tobias M; Scheller, Bertram; Wolf, Timo; Meier, Jens; Koch, Alexander; Zacharowski, Kai; Rosenberger, Peter; Iber, Thomas",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3309959/,81
1501,Patients with community acquired pneumonia admitted to European intensive care units: an epidemiological survey of the GenOSept cohort,2014-04-01,"INTRODUCTION: Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most common infectious reason for admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The GenOSept study was designed to determine genetic influences on sepsis outcome. Phenotypic data was recorded using a robust clinical database allowing a contemporary analysis of the clinical characteristics, microbiology, outcomes and independent risk factors in patients with severe CAP admitted to ICUs across Europe. METHODS: Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine mortality rates. A Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) model was used to identify variables independently associated with 28-day and six-month mortality. RESULTS: Data from 1166 patients admitted to 102 centres across 17 countries was extracted. Median age was 64 years, 62% were male. Mortality rate at 28 days was 17%, rising to 27% at six months. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the commonest organism isolated (28% of cases) with no organism identified in 36%. Independent risk factors associated with an increased risk of death at six months included APACHE II score (hazard ratio, HR, 1.03; confidence interval, CI, 1.01-1.05), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (HR1.44; CI 1.11-1.87) and ventilator support (HR 3.04; CI 1.64-5.62). Haematocrit, pH and urine volume on day one were all associated with a worse outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate in patients with severe CAP admitted to European ICUs was 27% at six months. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the commonest organism isolated. In many cases the infecting organism was not identified. Ventilator support, the presence of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, lower haematocrit, urine volume and pH on admission were independent predictors of a worse outcome.","Walden, Andrew P; Clarke, Geraldine M; McKechnie, Stuart; Hutton, Paula; Gordon, Anthony C; Rello, Jordi; Chiche, Jean-Daniel; Stueber, Frank; Garrard, Christopher S; Hinds, Charles J",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4056764/,81
1684,"CryptoDex: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial of adjunctive dexamethasone in HIV-infected adults with cryptococcal meningitis: study protocol for a randomised control trial",2014-11-12,"BACKGROUND: Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a severe AIDS-defining illness with 90-day case mortality as high as 70% in sub-Saharan Africa, despite treatment. It is the leading cause of death in HIV patients in Asia and Africa. No major advance has been made in the treatment of CM since the 1970s. The mainstays of induction therapy are amphotericin B and flucytosine, but these are often poorly available where the disease burden is highest. Adjunctive treatments, such as dexamethasone, have had dramatic effects on mortality in other neurologic infections, but are untested in CM. Given the high death rates in patients receiving current optimal treatment, and the lack of new agents on the horizon, adjuvant treatments, which offer the potential to reduce mortality in CM, should be tested. The principal research question posed by this study is as follows: does adding dexamethasone to standard antifungal therapy for CM reduce mortality? Dexamethasone is a cheap, readily available, and practicable intervention. METHOD: A double-blind placebo-controlled trial with parallel arms in which patients are randomised to receive either dexamethasone or placebo, in addition to local standard of care. The study recruits patients in both Asia and Africa to ensure the relevance of its results to the populations in which the disease burden is highest. The 10-week mortality risk in the control group is expected to be between 30% and 50%, depending on location, and the target hazard ratio of 0.7 corresponds to absolute risk reductions in mortality from 30% to 22%, or from 50% to 38%. Assuming an overall 10-week mortality of at least 30% in our study population, recruitment of 824 patients will be sufficient to observe the expected number of deaths. Allowing for some loss to follow-up, the total sample size for this study is 880 patients. To generate robust evidence across both continents, we aim to recruit roughly similar numbers of patients from each continent. The primary end point is 10-week mortality. Ethical approval has been obtained from Oxford University’s Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OxTREC), and as locally mandated at each site.

3545,What is the diagnostic accuracy of single nerve conduction studies and muscle ultrasound to identify critical illness polyneuromyopathy: a prospective cohort study,2018-12-17,"BACKGROUND: Critical illness polyneuromyopathy (CIPNM) is a major cause of weakness in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, but current diagnostic tests are limited. We evaluated the generalizability and validity of single nerve conduction studies (NCS) and muscle ultrasound testing to identify CIPNM, and we also assessed the ability of muscle ultrasound to prognosticate patient outcomes. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated medical, cardiac, surgical, and neurosurgical ICU patients. We performed weekly strength testing, NCS, electromyography (EMG), and muscle ultrasound. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and other test characteristics of single NCS and muscle ultrasound, and we used multivariable regression models to assess the prognostic ability of muscle ultrasound. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were enrolled. The incidence of probable CIPNM was 18% and did not differ significantly by type of ICU (p = 0.49). For diagnosing probable CIPNM, the peroneal motor NCS had a sensitivity of 94% (95% confidence interval (CI) 71–100%) and specificity of 91% (95% CI 82–96%), the sural sensory NCS had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 80–100%) and specificity of 42% (95% CI 31–54%), and abnormal muscle ultrasound echogenicity had a sensitivity of 82% (95% CI 48–98%) and specificity of 57% (95% CI 43–70%). Abnormal echogenicity was associated with reduced likelihood of discharge to home (9% vs 50%, p = 0.0001), fewer ICU-free days (median 3 (interquartile range 0–15) days vs 16 (9.3–19.3) days, p = 0.0002), and increased ICU mortality (42% vs 12%, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: In a diverse cohort of critically ill patients, single NCS and muscle ultrasound achieved diagnostic accuracy for patients at risk for CIPNM. The routine utilization of these tests could be beneficial for all critically ill patients at risk for CIPNM.

4171,Outcome and prognostic factors of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: a prospective observational study,2019-11-27,"BACKGROUND: Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) remains a severe disease associated with high rates of invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) and mortality. The objectives of this study were to assess early risk factors for severe PJP and 90-day mortality, including the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid cytology profiles at diagnosis. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled all patients meeting pre-defined diagnostic criteria for PJP admitted at Nantes university hospital, France, from January 2012 to January 2017. Diagnostic criteria for PJP were typical clinical features with microbiological confirmation of P. jirovecii cysts by direct examination or a positive specific quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Severe PJP was defined as hypoxemic acute respiratory failure requiring high-flow nasal oxygen with at least 50% FiO(2), non-invasive ventilation, or MV. RESULTS: Of 2446 respiratory samples investigated during the study period, 514 from 430 patients were positive for P. jirovecii. Of these 430 patients, 107 met criteria for PJP and were included in the study, 53 (49.5%) patients had severe PJP, including 30 who required MV. All patients were immunocompromised with haematological malignancy ranking first (n = 37, 35%), followed by solid organ transplantation (n = 27, 25%), HIV-infection (n = 21, 20%), systemic diseases (n = 13, 12%), solid tumors (n = 12, 11%) and primary immunodeficiency (n = 6, 8%). By multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with severity were older age (OR, 3.36; 95% CI 1.4–8.5; p < 0.05), a P. jirovecii microscopy-positive result from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (OR, 1.3; 95% CI 1.54–9.3; p < 0.05); and absence of a BAL fluid alveolitis profile (OR, 3.2; 95% CI 1.27–8.8; p < 0.04). The 90-day mortality rate was 27%, increasing to 50% in the severe PJP group. Factors independently associated with 90-day mortality were worse SOFA score on day 1 (OR, 1.05; 95% CI 1.02–1.09; p < 0.001) whereas alveolitis at BAL was protective (OR, 0.79; 95% CI 0.65–0.96; p < 0.05). In the subgroup of HIV-negative patients, similar findings were obtained, then viral co-infection were independently associated with higher 90-day mortality (OR, 1.25; 95% CI 1.02–1.55; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Older age and P. jirovecii oocysts at microscopic examination of BAL were independently associated with severe PJP. Both initial PJP severity as evaluated by the SOFA score and viral co-infection predicted 90-day mortality. Alveolitis at BAL examination was associated with less severe PJP. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying this observation deserves further investigation.","Gaborit, Benjamin Jean; Tessoulin, Benoit; Lavergne, Rose-Anne; Morio, Florent; Sagan, Christine; Canet, Emmanuel; Lecomte, Raphael; Leturnier, Paul; Deschanvres, Colin; Khatchatourian, Lydie; Asseray, Nathalie; Garret, Charlotte; Vourch, Michael; Marest, Delphine; Raffi, François; Boutoille, David; Reignier, Jean",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6881486/,81
4296,Clinical pharmacokinetics of 3-h extended infusion of meropenem in adult patients with severe sepsis and septic shock: implications for empirical therapy against Gram-negative bacteria,2020-01-10,"BACKGROUND: Optimal anti-bacterial activity of meropenem requires maintenance of its plasma concentration (Cp) above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the pathogen for at least 40% of the dosing interval (fT > MIC > 40). We aimed to determine whether a 3-h extended infusion (EI) of meropenem achieves fT > MIC > 40 on the first and third days of therapy in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. We also simulated the performance of the EI with respect to other pharmacokinetic (PK) targets such as fT > 4 × MIC > 40, fT > MIC = 100, and fT > 4 × MIC = 100. METHODS: Arterial blood samples of 25 adults with severe sepsis or septic shock receiving meropenem 1000 mg as a 3-h EI eight hourly (Q8H) were obtained at various intervals during and after the first and seventh doses. Plasma meropenem concentrations were determined using a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography assay, followed by modeling and simulation of PK data. European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) definitions of MIC breakpoints for sensitive and resistant Gram-negative bacteria were used. RESULTS: A 3-h EI of meropenem 1000 mg Q8H achieved fT > 2 µg/mL > 40 on the first and third days, providing activity against sensitive strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. However, it failed to achieve fT > 4 µg/mL > 40 to provide activity against strains susceptible to increased exposure in 33.3 and 39.1% patients on the first and the third days, respectively. Modeling and simulation showed that a bolus dose of 500 mg followed by 3-h EI of meropenem 1500 mg Q8H will achieve this target. A bolus of 500 mg followed by an infusion of 2000 mg would be required to achieve fT > 8 µg > 40. Targets of fT > 4 µg/mL = 100 and fT > 8 µg/mL = 100 may be achievable in two-thirds of patients by increasing the frequency of dosing to six hourly (Q6H). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, EI of 1000 mg of meropenem over 3 h administered Q8H is inadequate to provide activity (fT > 4 µg/mL > 40) against strains susceptible to increased exposure, which requires a bolus of 500 mg followed by EI of 1500 mg Q8H. While fT > 8 µg/mL > 40 require escalation of EI dose, fT > 4 µg/mL = 100 and fT > 8 µg/mL = 100 require escalation of both EI dose and frequency.","Kothekar, Amol T.; Divatia, Jigeeshu Vasishtha; Myatra, Sheila Nainan; Patil, Anand; Nookala Krishnamurthy, Manjunath; Maheshwarappa, Harish Mallapura; Siddiqui, Suhail Sarwar; Gurjar, Murari; Biswas, Sanjay; Gota, Vikram",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6954163/,81

4592,Impact of corticosteroid treatment on clinical outcomes of influenza-associated ARDS: a nationwide multicenter study,2020-02-27,"OBJECTIVE: Administration of diuretics has been shown to assist fluid management and improve clinical outcomes in the critically ill post-shock resolution. Current guidelines have not yet included standardization or guidance for diuretic-based de-resuscitation in critically ill patients. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a multi-disciplinary protocol for diuresis-guided de-resuscitation in the critically ill. METHODS: This was a pre-post single-center pilot study within the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of a large academic medical center. Adult patients admitted to the Medical ICU receiving mechanical ventilation with either (1) clinical signs of volume overload via chest radiography or physical exam or (2) any cumulative fluid balance ≥ 0 mL since hospital admission were eligible for inclusion. Patients received diuresis per clinician discretion for a 2-year period (historical control) followed by a diuresis protocol for 1 year (intervention). Patients within the intervention group were matched in a 1:3 ratio with those from the historical cohort who met the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: A total of 364 patients were included, 91 in the protocol group and 273 receiving standard care. Protocolized diuresis was associated with a significant decrease in 72-h post-shock cumulative fluid balance [median, IQR − 2257 (− 5676–920) mL vs 265 (− 2283–3025) mL; p < 0.0001]. In-hospital mortality in the intervention group was lower compared to the historical group (5.5% vs 16.1%; p = 0.008) and higher ICU-free days (p = 0.03). However, no statistically significant difference was found in ventilator-free days, and increased rates of hypernatremia and hypokalemia were demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a protocol for diuresis for de-resuscitation can significantly improve 72-h post-shock fluid balance with potential benefit on clinical outcomes.","Bissell, Brittany D.; Laine, Melanie E.; Thompson Bastin, Melissa L.; Flannery, Alexander H.; Kelly, Andrew; Riser, Jeremy; Neyra, Javier A.; Potter, Jordan; Morris, Peter E.",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7048112/,81

5698,Introduction and Executive Summary: Care of the Critically Ill and Injured During Pandemics and Disasters: CHEST Consensus Statement,2016-01-07,"Mayaro virus (MAYV) is a member of Togaviridae family, which also includes Chikungunya virus as a notorious member. MAYV recently emerged in urban areas of the Americas, and this emergence emphasized the current paucity of knowledge about its replication cycle. The macro domain (MD) of MAYV belongs to the N-terminal region of its non-structural protein 3, part of the replication complex. Here, we report the first structural and dynamical characterization of a previously unexplored Alphavirus MD investigated through high-resolution NMR spectroscopy, along with data on its ligand selectivity and binding properties. The structural analysis of MAYV MD reveals a typical “macro” (ββαββαβαβα) fold for this polypeptide, while NMR-driven interaction studies provide in-depth insights into MAYV MD–ligand adducts. NMR data in concert with thermodynamics and biochemical studies provide convincing experimental evidence for preferential binding of adenosine diphosphate ribose (ADP‐r) and adenine-rich RNAs to MAYV MD, thus shedding light on the structure–function relationship of a previously unexplored viral MD. The emerging differences with any other related MD are expected to enlighten distinct functions.","Tsika, Aikaterini C.; Melekis, Efstathios; Tsatsouli, Sofia-Antigoni; Papageorgiou, Nicolas; Maté, Maria J.; Canard, Bruno; Coutard, Bruno; Bentrop, Detlef; Spyroulias, Georgios A.",J Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094482/,81

5865,Inhaled nitric oxide for a severe respiratory syncytial virus infection in an infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia,1994,"Regeneration carries the idea of regrowing partially or completely a missing organ. Repair, on the other hand, allows restoring the function of an existing but failing organ. The recognition that human lungs can both repair and regenerate is quite novel, the concept has not been widely used to treat patients. We present evidence that the human adult lung does repair and regenerate and introduce different ways to harness this power. Various types of lung stem cells are capable of proliferating and differentiating upon injury driving the repair/regeneration process. Injury models, primarily in mice, combined with lineage tracing studies, have allowed the identification of these important cells. Some of these cells, such as basal cells, broncho-alveolar stem cells, and alveolar type 2 cells, rely on fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling for their survival, proliferation and/or differentiation. While preclinical studies have shown the therapeutic benefits of FGFs, a recent clinical trial for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) using intravenous injection of FGF7 did not report the expected beneficial effects. We discuss the potential reasons for these negative results and propose the rationale for new approaches for future clinical trials, such as delivery of FGFs to the damaged lungs through efficient inhalation systems, which may be more promising than systemic exposure to FGFs. While this change in the administration route presents a challenge, the therapeutic promises displayed by FGFs are worth the effort.","Chu, Xuran; Chen, Chengshui; Chen, Chaolei; Zhang, Jin-San; Bellusci, Saverio; Li, Xiaokun",Front Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095240/,81
5960,High frequency oscillatory ventilation for respiratory failure due to RSV bronchiolitis,2008-05-24,"Annual flu seasons are typically characterized by changes in types and subtypes of influenza, with variations in terms of severity. Despite remarkable improvements in the prevention and management of patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of influenza, annual seasonal influenza continues to be associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Admission to the intensive care unit is required for patients with severe forms of seasonal influenza infection, with primary pneumonia being present in most of the cases. This review summarizes the most recent knowledge on the diagnosis and treatment strategies in critically ill patients with influenza, focused on diagnostic testing methods, antiviral therapy, use of corticosteroids, antibacterial and antifungal therapy, and supportive measures. The review focuses on diagnostic testing methods, antiviral therapy, use of corticosteroids, antibacterial and antifungal therapy, supportive measures and relevant existing evidence, in order to provide the non-expert clinician a useful overview. An enhanced understanding of current diagnostic and treatment aspects of influenza infection can contribute to improve outcomes and reduce mortality among ICU patients with influenza.","Torres, Antoni; Loeches, Ignacio-Martin-; Sligl, Wendy; Lee, Nelson",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095473/,81
5973,Corticosteroid treatment in critically ill patients with severe influenza pneumonia: a propensity score matching study,2018-08-03,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the daily practice of mechanical ventilation (MV), and secondarily, its outcome in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). DESIGN: Prospective cohort of infants and children who received MV for at least 12 h. SETTING: Thirty-six medical surgical PICUs. PATIENTS: All consecutive patients admitted to the PICUs during 2-month period. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the 1893 patients admitted, 659 (35%) received MV for a median time of 4 days (25th percentile, 75%: 2, 6). Median of age was 13 months (25th percentile, 75%: 5, 48). Common indications for MV were acute respiratory failure (ARF) in 72% of the patients, altered mental status in 14% of the patients, and ARF on chronic pulmonary disease in 10% of the patients. Median length of stay in the PICUs was 8 days (25th percentile, 75%: 5, 13). Overall mortality rate in the PICUs was 15% (confidence interval 95%: 13–18) for the entire population, 50% (95% CI: 25–74) in patients who received MV because of acute respiratory distress syndrome, 24% (95% CI: 16–35) in patients who received MV for altered mental status and 16% (95% CI: 9–29) in patients who received MV for ARF on chronic pulmonary disease. CONCLUSION: One in every 3 patients admitted to the PICUs requires ventilatory support.. The ARF was the most common reason for MV, and survival of unselected infants and children receiving MV for more than 12 h was 85%.

We hypothesize that these diagnostic markers do not predict relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI) in the critically ill or injured patient. METHODS: Chart review of surgical, trauma, and medical patients admitted over 7 years to a critical care unit was performed to evaluate cortisol levels drawn for suspicion of RAI, which was defined as a cortisol concentration <25 mcg/dl. Laboratory parameters were defined as hyponatremia <135 mmol/l, hyperkalemia >5.3 mmol/l, hypercalcemia >2.55 mmol/l (10.2 mg/dl), hypoglycemia <3.89 mmol/l (70 mg/dl), and eosinophilia >5%. RESULTS: A total of 212 patients had cortisol levels drawn. Fifty-seven percent were male and their mean age was 59 years. Fifty-three percent had RAI. Average cortisol level was 30.5 μg/dl. No significant differences were seen in mean potassium, sodium, calcium, or glucose levels between RAI and non-RAI patients. Few patients had laboratory values consistent with RAI. In fact, many with RAI had opposite findings: 75% had hypernatremia, 90% had hypokalemia, 100% had hypocalcemia, and 97% had hyperglycemia. Eosinophilia was statistically significant (P = 0.026). CONCLUSION: Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, and hypoglycemia do not predominate in RAI and laboratory values are of minimal value in predicting patients with RAI.","Kromah, Fatuma; Tyroch, Alan; McLean, Susan; Hughes, Harold; Flavin, Nina; Lee, Soyoung",World J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101698/,81
6863,Hospital and intensive care unit management of decompensated pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure,2015-10-20,"The lungs provide a large inner surface to guarantee respiration. In lung alveoli, a delicate membrane formed by endo- and epithelial cells with their fused basal lamina ensures rapid and effective gas exchange between alveolar and vascular compartments while concurrently forming a robust barrier against inhaled particles and microbes. However, upon infectious or sterile inflammatory stimulation, tightly regulated endothelial barrier leakiness is required for leukocyte transmigration. Further, endothelial barrier disruption may result in uncontrolled extravasation of protein-rich fluids. This brief review summarizes some important mechanisms of pulmonary endothelial barrier regulation and disruption, focusing on the role of specific cell populations, coagulation and complement cascades and mediators including angiopoietins, specific sphingolipids, adrenomedullin and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species for the regulation of pulmonary endothelial barrier function. Further, current therapeutic perspectives against development of lung injury are discussed.","Müller-Redetzky, Holger C.; Suttorp, Norbert; Witzenrath, Martin",Cell Tissue Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102256/,81

We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of methamphetamine-associated ICH (Meth-ICH) versus Non-Meth-ICH. Patients with ICH between January 2011 and December 2017 were studied. Meth-ICH and Non-Meth-ICH were defined by history of abuse and urine drug screen (UDS). The clinical features of the 2 groups were explored. Among the 677 consecutive patients, 61 (9.0%) were identified as Meth-ICH and 350 as Non-Meth ICH. Meth-ICH was more common in Hispanics (14.6%) and Whites (10.1%) as compared to Asians (1.2%). Patients with Meth-ICH were more often younger (51.2 vs. 62.2 years, p < 0.001), male (77.0% vs. 61.4.0%, p < 0.05), and smokers (44.3% vs. 13.4%, p < 0.001). Non-Meth-ICH was more likely to have history of hypertension (72.61% v. 59%, p < 0.05) or antithrombotic use (10.9% vs. 1.6%, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in clinical severity, hospital length of stay (LOS), rate of functional independence (29.5% vs. 25.7%, p = 0.534), or mortality (18.0% vs. 24.6%, p = 0.267) between the 2 groups.

9794,Diastolic shock index and clinical outcomes in patients with septic shock,2020-04-16,"BACKGROUND: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children experience some of the highest rates of otitis media in the world. Key risk factors for otitis media in Aboriginal children in Australia are largely social and environmental factors such as overcrowded housing, poverty and limited access to services. Despite this, little is known about how to address these risk factors. A scoping content review was performed to determine the relationship between social determinants of health and otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children as described by peer-reviewed and grey literature. METHOD: Search terms were established for location, population and health condition. The search terms were used to conduct a literature search using six health research databases. Following the exclusion process, articles were scoped, analysed and categorised using scoping parameters and a social determinants of health framework. RESULTS: Housing-related issues were the most frequently reported determinants for otitis media (56%). Two articles (4%) directly investigated the impact of social determinants of health on rates of otitis media within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The majority of the literature (68%) highlights social determinants as playing a key role in the high rates of otitis media seen in Aboriginal populations in Australia. There were no intervention studies targeting social determinants as a means to reduce otitis media rates among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. CONCLUSIONS: This review identifies a disconnect between otitis media drivers and the focus of public health interventions within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. Despite consensus that social determinants play a key role in the high rates of otitis media in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, the majority of intervention studies within the literature are focussed on biomedical approaches such as research on vaccines and antibiotics. This review highlights the need for otitis media intervention studies to shift away from a purely biomedical model and toward investigating the underlying social determinants of health. By shifting interventions upstream, otitis media rates may decrease within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, as focus is shifted away from a treatment-focussed model and toward a more preventative model.","DeLacy, Jack; Dune, Tinashe; Macdonald, John J.",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7161003/,81

During systematic increases in the NAVA level, feedback-controlled down-regulation of the EAdi results in a characteristic two-phased response in P(aw) and tidal volume (Vt). The transition from the 1st to the 2nd response phase allows identification of adequate unloading of the respiratory muscles with NAVA (NAVA(AL)). We aimed to develop and validate a mathematical algorithm to identify NAVA(AL). P(aw), Vt, and EAdi were recorded while systematically increasing the NAVA level in 19 adult patients. In a multistep approach, inspiratory P(aw) peaks were first identified by dividing the EAdi into inspiratory portions using Gaussian mixture modeling. Two polynomials were then fitted onto the curves of both P(aw) peaks and Vt. The beginning of the P(aw) and Vt plateaus, and thus NAVA (AL), was identified at the minimum of squared polynomial derivative and polynomial fitting errors. A graphical user interface was developed in the Matlab computing environment. Median NAVA(AL) visually estimated by 18 independent physicians was 2.7 (range 0.4 to 5.8) cm⋅H (2)O/ [Formula: see text] V and identified by our model was 2.6 (range 0.6 to 5.0) cm⋅H (2)O/ [Formula: see text] V. NAVA(AL) identified by our model was below the range of visually estimated NAVA(AL) in two instances and was above in one instance. We conclude that our model identifies NAVA(AL) in most instances with acceptable accuracy for application in clinical routine and research.","Ververidis, Dimitrios; van Gils, Mark; Passath, Christina; Takala, Jukka; Brander, Lukas",IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176475/,81

The two new species are the second and third ones recovered from environments other than freshwater. In terms of scale morphology they most closely resemble a freshwater species, Korotnevella bulla (Schaeffer, 1926) Goodkov, 1988. Two genus names, Dactylamoeba Korotnev, 1880 and Korotnevella Goodkov, 1988, are in current use. The latter name is preferred, pending rediscovery and characterization of Dactylamoeba elongata Korotnev, 1880, the type species of the genus. Korotnevella species can be divided into three groups on the basis of scale morphology, suggesting that the genus may not be monophyletic.

A prospective, multicenter cohort study",2020-01-07,"Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is often complicated by elevation of cardiac troponin, a marker of myocardial injury that can be isolated or associated with myocardial infarction (MI). A retrospective study showed that corticosteroid treatment lowers the incidence of MI during the hospital stay. No data exist so far on the effect of corticosteroids on myocardial injury in CAP patients. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate if methylprednisolone is able to reduce myocardial injury, as assessed by serum high-sensitivity cardiac T Troponin (hs-cTnT), in a cohort of patients hospitalized for CAP. Secondary aims are to evaluate the potential effect of methylprednisolone on cardiovascular events during hospitalization, at 30 days from hospital admission and during 2 years’ follow-up. The trial will also examine whether the potential protective effects of methylprednisolone might be due to platelet activation down-regulation. Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. One hundred twenty-two eligible patients will be randomized to a week treatment with iv methylprednisolone (20 mg b.i.d) or placebo from hospital admission. Serum hs-cTnT will be measured at admission and every day until up 3 days from admission. ECG will be monitored every day until discharge. After discharge, all patients will be followed-up 2 years. This is the first clinical trial aimed at examining whether methylprednisolone treatment may reduce myocardial injury.

Limited data exist regarding these associations in unselected cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) patients. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of CICU patients between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2015, with a hemoglobin (Hb) level measured at admission. Multivariable regression was performed to determine predictors of hospital mortality, and Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to determine post-discharge survival. RESULTS: We included 9644 patients with a mean age of 67.5 ± 15.1 years, including 3604 (37.4%) females. The median (IQR) values of Hb, MCV and RDW were 12.2 g/dL (10.6, 13.7), 90.7 fL (87.3, 94.2) fL, and 14.1% (13.3, 15.8), respectively. Anemia (admission Hb < 12 g/dL) was present in 4434 (46%) patients. A total of 845 (8.8%) patients died in the hospital. Patients with anemia had higher hospital mortality (11.3% vs. 6.6%, unadjusted OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.58–2.10, p < 0.001). After multivariable regression, admission Hb and MCV were not significantly associated with hospital mortality (both p > 0.1), while admission RDW (adjusted OR 1.12 per 1%, 95% CI 1.07–1.18, p < 0.001) was significantly associated with hospital mortality. Hospital survivors with lower Hb, higher MCV, or higher RDW had lower post-discharge survival. CONCLUSION: Elevated RDW on admission was independently associated with higher hospital mortality in CICU patients. These data emphasize the importance of hematologic abnormalities for mortality risk stratification in CICU populations.

This proposition is based upon two arguments. First is the observation that bacterial and archaeal lineages experience processes oppositional to bifurcation and hence the representation of the evolutionary process in a tree like structure is illogical. Second is the argument tree building approaches are circular—you ask for a tree and you get one, which pins a verificationist label on tree building that, if correct, should be the end of phylogenetic analysis as we currently know it. In this review, we examine these questions and suggest that rumors of the death of the bacterial tree of life are exaggerated at best.","DeSalle, Rob; Riley, Margaret",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7466111/,81

Recent data show that 34 million people are living with HIV-1 worldwide. HIV-1 infections can lead to AIDS which still causes nearly 20,000 deaths annually in the USA alone. As this retrovirus leads to high morbidity and mortality conditions, more effective therapeutic regimens must be developed to treat these viral infections. A key target for intervention for which there are no current FDA-approved modulators is at the point of proviral transcription. One successful method for identifying novel therapeutics for treating infectious diseases is the repurposing of pharmaceuticals that are approved by the FDA for alternate indications. Major benefits of using FDA-approved drugs include the fact that the compounds have well established toxicity profiles, approved manufacturing processes, and immediate commercial availability to the patients. Here, we demonstrate that pharmaceuticals previously approved for other indications can be utilized to either activate or inhibit HIV-1 proviral transcription. Specifically, we found febuxostat, eltrombopag, and resveratrol to be activators of HIV-1 transcription, while mycophenolate was our lead inhibitor of HIV-1 transcription. Additionally, we observed that the infected cells of lymphoid and myeloid lineage responded differently to our lead transcriptional modulators. Finally, we demonstrated that the use of a multi-dose regimen allowed for enhanced activation with our transcriptional activators.","Sampey, Gavin C.; Iordanskiy, Sergey; Pleet, Michelle L.; DeMarino, Catherine; Romerio, Fabio; Mahieux, Renaud; Kashanchi, Fatah",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7598649/,81

Monitoring on CPAP is often done by calculating oxygenation after blood gas analysis which is an invasive procedure. Saturation oxygen pressure index (SOPI) is a simple, non-invasive, bedside tool to monitor the severity of respiratory illness in neonates on CPAP. This study was aimed at validation of SOP index against AaDO2 and determine the cut-off values of SOPI for A-aDO2 of 70, 85 and100. This was a prospective observational study on 126 neonates with respiratory distress and treated with CPAP. The correlation between SOPI and A-aDO2 was validated using Bootstrap method. There was a significant positive correlation between SOPI and A-aDO2 with the Spearman correlation coefficient (rho) being 0.815 (p = 0). The mean coefficient of correlation after Bootstrap was 0.827 (p value < 0.0001). SOPI values of 1.52, 1.57 and 1.6 predicted A-aDO2 value of 70, 85 and 100 with a sensitivity of above 80% and specificity above 90%, respectively. Conclusion: SOPI has a significant positive correlation of 82.7% against A-aDO2 and can be a valuable tool to assess respiratory distress in neonates without arterial blood gas.","Thandaveshwara, Deepti; Chandrashekar Reddy, Ashok Huduguru; Gopalakrishna, Manjunath Vaddamabal; Doreswamy, Srinivasa Murthy",Eur J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7678771/,81

The present experiment was designed to evaluate the potential of two native nodule endophytic bacterial strains, viz. Bacillus aryabhattai AS03 (MT645244) and Rhizobium pusense AS05 (MT645243), isolated from contaminated sites to be considered remediation tool to minimize the effect of Cr toxicity on Macrotyloma uniflorum var. Madhu. The two nodule endophytic bacterial strains AS03 and AS05 exhibited tolerance to 1800 and 3000 ppm of Cr(VI) respectively in vitro when cultured alone. AAS analysis confirmed higher accumulation of Cr(VI) in roots and less accumulation in shoots which is dose-specific (bio-inoculant) either treated alone or combined. Complete absence of Cr accumulation approximately 99% in shoots of Macrotyloma was observed owing to synergistic effect of both the strains (biochar-based formulation). This study also suggests increased shoot and root length, nodule nos., and leghemoglobin content of the plant at 60 days indicating the plant growth-promoting effects of both the strains. ROS and antioxidant enzymes of the plant recorded decreasing trend in inoculated plants. However, a significant increment in transpiration rate, total photosynthetic rate, intracellular CO(2) conc., and stomatal conductance in leaves was observed owing to dual inoculation. Our findings corroborate the supremacy of synergistic effect of both the strains applied in the form of biochar-based biofertilizer in enhancing growth and tolerance index of M. uniflorum cultivated in Cr(VI)-stressed soil. This investigation depicts the efficiency of the two nodule bacteria as a mixed inoculant to alleviate Cr toxicity and making the seeds safe for consumption.

15538,Surfactant therapies for pediatric and neonatal ARDS: ESPNIC expert consensus opinion for future research steps,2021-02-22,"BACKGROUND: Ischemic heart disease is a leading cause of heart failure and despite advanced therapeutic options, morbidity and mortality rates remain high. Although acute inflammation in response to myocardial cell death has been extensively studied, subsequent adaptive immune activity and anti-heart autoimmunity may also contribute to the development of heart failure. After ischemic injury to the myocardium, dendritic cells (DC) respond to cardiomyocyte necrosis, present cardiac antigen to T cells, and potentially initiate a persistent autoimmune response against the heart. Cross-priming DC have the ability to activate both CD4(+) helper and CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells in response to necrotic cells and may thus be crucial players in exacerbating autoimmunity targeting the heart. This study investigates a role for cross-priming DC in post–myocardial infarction immunopathology through presentation of self-antigen from necrotic cardiac cells to cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells. METHODS: We induced type 2 myocardial infarction–like ischemic injury in the heart by treatment with a single high dose of the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. We characterized the DC population in the heart and mediastinal lymph nodes and analyzed long-term cardiac immunopathology and functional decline in wild type and Clec9a-depleted mice lacking DC cross-priming function. RESULTS: A diverse DC population, including cross-priming DC, is present in the heart and activated after ischemic injury. Clec9a(−/−) mice deficient in DC cross-priming are protected from persistent immune-mediated myocardial damage and decline of cardiac function, likely because of dampened activation of cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells. CONCLUSION: Activation of cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells by cross-priming DC contributes to exacerbation of postischemic inflammatory damage of the myocardium and corresponding decline in cardiac function. Importantly, this provides novel therapeutic targets to prevent postischemic immunopathology and heart failure.","Forte, Elvira; Perkins, Bryant; Sintou, Amalia; Kalkat, Harkaran S.; Papanikolaou, Angelos; Jenkins, Catherine; Alsubaie, Mashael; Chowdhury, Rasheda A.; Duffy, Theodore M.; Skelly, Daniel A.; Branca, Jane; Bellahcene, Mohamed; Schneider, Michael D.; Harding, Sian E.; Furtado, Milena B.; Ng, Fu Siong; Hasham, Muneer G.; Rosenthal, Nadia; Sattler, Susanne",Circulation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7899721/,81

TRIAL DESIGN: Open-label, parallel, 1:1, phase 3, 2-arm randomized controlled trial PARTICIPANTS: The study population includes hospitalized adults admitted for COVID-19 prior to the development of critical illness. Excluded individuals are those where the bleeding risk or risk of transfusion would generally be considered unacceptable, those already therapeutically anticoagulated and those who have already have any component of the primary composite outcome. Participants are recruited from hospital sites in Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and the United States of America. 1. Laboratory confirmed COVID-19 (diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction as per the World Health Organization protocol or by nucleic acid based isothermal amplification) prior to hospital admission OR within first 5 days (i.e. 120 hours) after hospital admission; 2. Admitted to hospital for COVID-19; 3. a. D-Dimer ≥2 times ULN OR. b. D-Dimer above ULN and Oxygen saturation ≤ 93% on room air; 4. > 18 years of age; 5.

Summer camps for children with obesity represent an alternative setting to improve eating and physical activity habits. Here we evaluated if the participation in the camp improves objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behavior and whether there are differences between male and female participants. Twenty-eight children, 13 males and 15 females (body mass index >97° centile, weight excess >30%, Tanner stage I), agreed to participate in an 8-day camp. During the summer camp, children participated in sports-like games and outdoor activities for at least 3 h a day, and the school-camp staff also provided a theoretical nutritional learning plan. Accelerometry-derived physical activity was measured through the SenseWear Mini Armband during a week at home and during the camp experience. Before camping, the participants were far above the minimum daily values of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) to be considered sufficiently active (≥60 min/day), but male participants were more active than females (MVPA: 186.2 ± 94.2, 111.0 ± 64.7; P = 0.020). Male participants increased their MVPA (234.3 ± 114.8, P = 0.020), whereas females not (111.9 ± 52.9, P = 0.020). No difference emerged for the sedentary behavior either before or during the camp. This study suggests that participation in a summer camp for obese children can determine different responses in physical activity levels, depending on the sex of young participants. Thus, summer camps for obese children should put particular attention on female participants, besides reducing sedentary behavior in both males and females.","Izzicupo, Pascal; Di Blasio, Andrea; Di Credico, Andrea; Ghinassi, Barbara; Capranica, Laura; Napolitano, Giorgio; Di Baldassarre, Angela; Modestini, Elisabetta; Di Pietro, Mario",Front Sports Act Living,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8027230/,81

METHODS: The Large observational study to UNderstand the Global impact of Severe Acute respiratory FailurE study was an international, multicenter, prospective cohort study of patients with severe respiratory failure, conducted across 459 ICUs from 50 countries globally. This study aimed to understand the frequency and factors associated with death in hospital in patients who survived their ICU stay. We examined outcomes in the subpopulation discharged with no limitations of life sustaining treatments (‘treatment limitations’), and the subpopulations with treatment limitations. RESULTS: 2186 (94%) patients with no treatment limitations discharged from ICU survived, while 142 (6%) died in hospital. 118 (61%) of patients with treatment limitations survived while 77 (39%) patients died in hospital. Patients without treatment limitations that died in hospital after ICU discharge were older, more likely to have COPD, immunocompromise or chronic renal failure, less likely to have trauma as a risk factor for ARDS. Patients that died post ICU discharge were less likely to receive neuromuscular blockade, or to receive any adjunctive measure, and had a higher pre- ICU discharge non-pulmonary SOFA score. A similar pattern was seen in patients with treatment limitations that died in hospital following ICU discharge. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of patients die in hospital following discharge from ICU, with higher mortality in patients with limitations of life-sustaining treatments in place. Non-survivors had higher systemic illness severity scores at ICU discharge than survivors. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02010073.

17070,Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency during difficult weaning from mechanical ventilation,2021-04-26,"Polyurethane (PU) is a typical product of the reaction between isocyanate and polyol, whose ratio would greatly influence material properties. In this paper, to investigate the influence of isocyanate on PU thermal stability and flammability, three kinds of rigid polyurethanes (RPUs) with different isocyanate ratio (1.05, 1.1, and 2.0) were manufactured in a laboratory and employed to have a series of TG (thermogravimetry), DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), and cone calorimetry tests. Kissinger’s method was used to calculate the activation energy and judge their stabilities. However, for such a complex degradation which consists of five reactions, it does not make sense by Kissinger method to obtain only two peak active energies. Considering complexity of PU degradation in air, genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to calculate kinetic triplets of five sub-reactions. The effects of isocyanate contents on each sub-reaction stability were obtained and then analyzed. By cone calorimeter testing, we found that great differences in heat release rate data. However, DSC analysis showed a complete opposite changed trend. Such difference is caused by DSC and calorimeter’s sample morphology, the former using grinded polyurethane powders but the latter polyurethane foam block.","Jiang, Lin; Berto, Filippo; Zhang, Dan",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8073025/,81

Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), especially exosomes, are nanoscale vesicles released by various cells that deliver bioactive molecules to recipient cells, affecting their biological characteristics, changing the tumour microenvironment and producing long-distance effects. In recent years, many studies have clarified the mechanisms by which sEVs function with regard to the initiation, progression, angiogenesis, metastasis and chemoresistance of GC. These molecules can function as mediators of cell-cell communication in the tumour microenvironment and might affect the efficacy of immunotherapy. Due to their unique physiochemical characteristics, sEVs show potential as effective antitumour vaccines as well as drug carriers. In this review, we summarize the roles of sEVs in GC and highlight the clinical application prospects in the future.","Wu, Hao; Fu, Mengdi; Liu, Jin; Chong, Wei; Fang, Zhen; Du, Fengying; Liu, Yang; Shang, Liang; Li, Leping",Mol Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8081769/,81

Beyond mild symptoms, the infection can lead to respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure. Occurrence of resistant seasonal and pandemic strains against the currently licensed antiviral medications points to the urgent need for new and amply available anti-influenza drugs. Interestingly, the virus-supportive function of the cellular phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) suggests that this signaling module may be a potential target for antiviral intervention. In the sense of repurposing existing drugs for new indications, we used Pictilisib, a known PI3K inhibitor to investigate its effect on IV infection, in mono-cell-culture studies as well as in a human chip model. Our results indicate that Pictilisib is a potent inhibitor of IV propagation already at early stages of infection. In a murine model of IV pneumonia, the in vitro key findings were verified, showing reduced viral titers as well as inflammatory response in the lung after delivery of Pictilisib. Our data identified Pictilisib as a promising drug candidate for anti-IV therapies that warrant further studying. These results further led to the conclusion that the repurposing of previously approved substances represents a cost-effective and efficient way for development of novel antiviral strategies.","Deinhardt-Emmer, Stefanie; Jäckel, Laura; Häring, Clio; Böttcher, Sarah; Wilden, Janine J.; Glück, Brigitte; Heller, Regine; Schmidtke, Michaela; Koch, Mirijam; Löffler, Bettina; Ludwig, Stephan; Ehrhardt, Christina",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8228449/,81

This enzyme's activation might be an alternative strategy for treating diseases such as neutropenia induced by chemotherapy, prostate, and breast cancer. Recently, a series of compounds that promote the activation of c-Abl has been identified, opening a promising ground for c-Abl drug development. Structure-based drug design (SBDD) and ligand-based drug design (LBDD) methodologies have significantly impacted recent drug development initiatives. Here, we combined SBDD and LBDD approaches to characterize critical chemical properties and interactions of identified c-Abl's activators. We used molecular docking simulations combined with tree-based machine learning models—decision tree, AdaBoost, and random forest to understand the c-Abl activators' structural features required for binding to myristoyl pocket, and consequently, to promote enzyme and cellular activation. We obtained predictive and robust models with Matthews correlation coefficient values higher than 0.4 for all endpoints and identified characteristics that led to constructing a structure–activity relationship model (SAR).

Currently, there is a lack of user-friendly software solutions that are integrated into the IT infrastructure of hospitals and practices to allow efficient data entry. STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: Radiological reports are mostly generated as free text documents, either dictated via speech recognition systems or typed. In addition, text components are used to create reports of normal findings that can be further edited and complemented by free text. METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS: Software-based reporting systems can combine speech recognition systems with radiological reporting templates in the form of interactive decision trees. A technical integration into RIS (“radiological information system”), PACS (“picture archiving and communication system”), and AV (“advanced visualization”) systems via application programming interfaces and interoperability standards can enable efficient processes and the generation of machine-readable report data. PERFORMANCE: Structured and semantically annotated clinical data collected via the reporting system are immediately available for epidemiological data analysis and continuous AI training. EVALUATION: The use of structured reporting in routine radiological diagnostics involves an initial transition phase. A successful implementation further requires close integration of the technical infrastructure of several systems.

26018,The liver in critical illness,2008,"Host range describes the range of species that a virus can infect to productively propagate itself. Productive infection requires compatibility between virus and host molecules. Thus host range may be restricted by lack of appropriate permissivity factors;alternatively, hosts may actively counteract infection using restriction factors. Incompatibility between virus and host can manifest on the level of individual cells,of tissues or organs,and of the entire organism. All hepatitis B viruses are hepatotropic,but individual viruses infect the livers of only selected mammalian (orthohepadnaviruses) and avian (avihepadnaviruses) hosts. Hence a narrow host range is thought to be a salient feature of hepadnaviruses. Here we briefly review general mechanisms of host range restriction,and summarise older as well as recent data pertaining to hepadnaviral host range. Clearly,the term species-specific is inadequate for many hepadnaviruses because they can infect different species from one genus,and even species from different genera. For a few others,only a single species,or genus,has been identified that supports efficient infection;however,this could as well relate to the restricted number of experimentally addressable test species. Together with the uncertainty about quantitative phylogenetic relationships between species,still largely based on morphological rather than molecular criteria,this leaves the term narrow open to interpretation. Finally,few if any of the host molecules enabling productive infection by a hepadnavirus have unambiguously been identified,the role of restriction factors has not yet been assessed,and even on the virus side the so-called host determining regions in the PreS domains of the large envelope proteins appear to be relevant only under specialised experimental conditions. Hence this important aspect of hepadnavirus biology is still far from being understood.","Dallmeier, Kai; Nassal, Michael",Comparative Hepatitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122827/,81

To investigate the impact of superspreaders on epidemic dynamics, we formulate deterministic and stochastic models that incorporate differences in superspreaders versus nonsuperspreaders. In particular, continuous-time Markov chain models are used to investigate epidemic features associated with the presence of superspreaders in a population. We parameterize the models for two case studies, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and Ebola. Through mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, we find that the probability of outbreaks increases and time to outbreaks decreases as the prevalence of superspreaders increases in the population. In particular, as disease outbreaks occur more rapidly and more frequently when initiated by superspreaders, our results emphasize the need for expeditious public health interventions.","Edholm, Christina J.; Emerenini, Blessing O.; Murillo, Anarina L.; Saucedo, Omar; Shakiba, Nika; Wang, Xueying; Allen, Linda J.

Before the pandemic, we were living in a scandalously unequal world in which one per cent owned as much wealth as the rest of the globe’s population. Worse yet, as Eduardo Galeano suggested, in our upside-down world, this injustice had come to be accepted as a law of nature. This calamity has ravaged the planet with added suffering—some from the disease itself and more that is the result of structural injustice and policies adopted in response. But the disruption in the lives of tens of millions, as well as in the organization of our societies, provides an opportunity for subverting a number of pillars of the upside-down world, and we in the overlapping fields of health justice and human rights have a responsibility to think and act boldly on transformative political possibilities now. In this essay, I set out three lessons and the implications of those lessons. First, we must hold governments to account for the disparate impacts not only of the virus but of governmental responses to the virus. Secondly, if we hope to emerge from this pandemic with meaningful social contracts, it is imperative that we understand health and health systems as integral to democracy. Thirdly, we need to reimagine the architecture of aid, as well as global health and economic governance.","Yamin, Alicia Ely",J Hum Rights Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7665552/,81

Patterns of AMR in the Middle East (ME) and resistance profiles of pathogens included in the Global AMR Surveillance System (GLASS) supported by the World Health Organization; 2. Differences in proportions of AMR isolates between conflict and non-conflict countries. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines and searching five electronic databases. Subject heading and free text were searched for “antimicrobial resistances” and “Middle East”, to identify observational studies on AMR published from January 2011 to June 2018. Data were extracted from included articles on a predefined set of variables. Percentages of AMR were analysed as median and interquartile ranges. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: 1. High proportions of carbapenem resistance in Acinetobacter spp. (median 74.2%), and both carbapenem resistance (median 8.1 and 15.4% for E. coli and K. pneumoniae respectively) and ESBL-production (median 32.3 and 27.9% for E. coli and K. pneumoniae respectively) amongst Enterobacteriaceae. S. aureus isolates showed a median methicillin resistance percentage of 45.1%, while vancomycin resistance was almost absent. A median of 50% of the strains of S. pneumoniae showed non-susceptibility to penicillin. 2. Similar trends were observed in conflict and non-conflict affected countries. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of standardization in the methodological approach to AMR research in the Middle East. The proportion of antibiotic resistances among specific GLASS pathogens is high, particularly among Acinetobacter spp. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary information accompanies this paper at 10.1186/s12879-020-05503-8.","Truppa, Claudia; Abo-Shehada, Mahmoud N.",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7724697/,81

In this study, we investigate the effects of drought on mental health in a rural population, and how these effects change with continued exposure to drought conditions. Using a panel dataset consisting of 6,519 observations from the Australian Rural Mental Health Study, we found a non-linear (inverted U-shape) relationship between drought exposure and mental health. Specifically, people experienced an increase of psychological distress for the first 2.5–3 years of drought, after which time this distress dissipates. These effects were maintained after controlling for demographic, social, and environmental factors. We also found that while psychological distress decreases in the later stages of drought, this does not necessarily mean people have good mental health because, for example, factors such as life satisfaction decreased as drought persisted. This is important as it highlights the need for sustained support to mitigate the long-term effects of drought on mental health that persist after the drought has apparently finished.","Luong, Tuyen T.; Handley, Tonelle; Austin, Emma K.; Kiem, Anthony S.; Rich, Jane L.; Kelly, Brian",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8440818/,81

64194,Influence of different interfaces on synchrony during pressure support ventilation in a pediatric setting: a bench study.,2015,"ATTR amyloidosis is caused by systemic deposition of transthyretin (TTR) and comprises ATTRwt (wt for wild-type) amyloidosis, ATTRv (v for variant) amyloidosis, and acquired ATTR amyloidosis after domino liver transplantation. ATTRwt amyloidosis has classically been regarded as cardiomyopathy found in the elderly, whereas carpal tunnel syndrome has also become a major initial manifestation. The phenotypes of ATTRv amyloidosis are diverse and include neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, and oculoleptomeningeal involvement as the predominant features, depending on the mutation and age of onset. In addition to variant TTR, the deposition of wild-type TTR plays a significant role, even in patients with ATTRv amyloidosis. The formation of amyloid fibrils tends to occur in association with the basement membrane. The thickening or reduplication of the basement membrane surrounding endoneurial microvessels, which is similar to diabetic neuropathy, is observed in ATTRv amyloidosis, suggesting that common mechanisms, such as an accumulation of advanced glycation end products, may participate in the disease process. In addition to direct damage caused by amyloid fibrils, recent studies have suggested that the toxicity of nonfibrillar TTRs, such as TTR oligomers, participates in the process of tissue damage. Although liver transplantation has been performed for patients with ATTRv amyloidosis since 1990, late-onset patients were not eligible for this treatment. However, as the efficacy of orally administered tafamidis and diflunisal, which stabilize TTR tetramers, was suggested in the early 2010s, such late-onset patients have also become targets for disease-modifying therapies. Additionally, recent studies of small interfering RNA (patisiran) and antisense oligonucleotide (inotersen) therapies have demonstrated the efficacy of these gene-silencing agents. A strategy for monitoring patients that enables the choice of an appropriate treatment from comprehensive and long-term viewpoints should be established. As many patients with ATTR amyloidosis are aged and have heart failure, they are at increased risk of aggravation if they are infected by SARS-CoV2. The optimal interval of evaluation should also be considered, particularly in this COVID-19 era.","Koike, Haruki; Katsuno, Masahisa",Neurology and therapy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40120-020-00210-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32948978/,81

STUDY DESIGN In this single blind randomized controlled trial, one cm incisions were performed on the right and left uterine horns of ten non-pregnant rats, and these incisions were randomly allocated for closure by a suture material with either polyglyconate (V-Loc™) or polyglactin-910 (Vicryl(®)). Each rat served as its own control. Six weeks after the operation, the abdomen was re-opened and the abdominal and surgical sites were evaluated by a researcher blinded to the side of the suture materials in the first operation. Adhesions were scored according to their severity, and specimens were also evaluated and scored histologically according to the following features: collagen deposition and inflammatory reaction. RESULTS The median macroscopic adhesion scores in the barbed and standard suture group were 3.5 and 2, respectively (p=.008). There was significant difference between the barbed and standard suture group with regard to the median inflammatory cell scores for macrophages-foreign body giant cell (1 vs. 3, respectively, p=.01) and mononuclear cell (2 vs. 3, respectively, p=.04). CONCLUSION Based on the results of the present study, we suggest that in the rat model, the type of the suture used for myometrial closure has an effect on subsequent adhesion formation, and this adverse outcome was more frequently observed with the barbed suture.","Api, Murat; Boza, Aysen; Cıkman, Muzaffer Seyhan; Aker, Figen Vardar; Onenerk, Mine","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2014.11.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25562637/,81

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Public hospitals. PARTICIPANTS 362 doctors and 1702 nurses in major departments of five hospitals of three Chinese provinces. METHODS An anonymous online survey was conducted from October to November 2020, facilitated by hospital administrators through online WeChat/QQ working groups. Data on outcome expectations, self-efficacy, norms, and COVID-19-related work experiences were collected. Multivariate logistic regression models were used for data analysis. RESULTS The logistic regression analysis showed that physical (e.g., protective effect of vaccination) and self-evaluative outcome expectations (e.g., anticipated regret), self-efficacy, norms (e.g., descriptive norm, subjective norm, professional norm, and moral norm), and job satisfaction were significantly and positively associated with the free and self-paid COVID-19 vaccination intention outcomes among doctors and nurses, adjusted for background variables. Doctors who had engaged in COVID-19-related work reported higher self-paid vaccination intention. CONCLUSIONS Health promotion is needed to improve the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers. Such interventions may consider modifying the identified factors of vaccination intention, including strengthening perceived efficacy, positive feelings about vaccination, the need to avoid future regret, self-efficacy, and social norms. Future studies should examine the actual behavior patterns of COVID-19 vaccination and testing the efficacy of promotion intervention through randomized controlled studies.","She, Rui; Chen, Xi; Li, Liping; Li, Lijuan; Huang, Zepeng; Lau, Joseph T F",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2021.201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33938413/,81

76550,"Wireless, Skin-Interfaced Devices for Pediatric Critical Care: Application to Continuous, Noninvasive Blood Pressure Monitoring.",2021-05-03,"OBJECTIVES Patients with chronic noncancer pain frequently report symptoms of depression and anxiety (negative affect), which are associated with higher ratings of pain intensity and a greater likelihood of being prescribed chronic opioid therapy. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to test the hypothesis that initial levels of negative affect can predict treatment-related outcomes in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of extended-release (ER) hydromorphone among opioid-tolerant patients with chronic low back pain. METHODS Four hundred fifty-nine (N = 459) patients participated in the titration/conversion phase of a multicenter study, of which 268 were randomized to receive once-daily hydromorphone or placebo. All patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at baseline and were divided evenly into Low (N = 157), Moderate (N = 155), and High (N = 147) negative affect groups based on their scores. Group differences in numerical pain intensity measures at home and in the clinic, Roland-Morris Disability ratings, and measures of symptoms from the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) throughout the trial were analyzed. RESULTS Two hundred sixty-eight of the initial 459 subjects who entered the 2 to 4-week titration/conversion phase (pretreatment) were successfully randomized to either placebo or ER hydromorphone; a total of 110 patients then completed this double-blind phase of the study. Those in the Moderate and High negative affect groups tended to drop out more often during the titration/conversion phase because of the adverse effects or lack of efficacy of their prescribed opioid than those in the Low negative mood group (P < 0.05). Overall, those patients in the Moderate and High groups reported significantly higher pain intensity scores in at-home and in-clinic pain intensity ratings (P < 0.05), greater disability on the Roland-Morris Scale (P < 0.01), and more withdrawal symptoms on the SOWS (P < 0.05) than those in the Low group. Higher negative affect scores also predicted less favorable ratings of the study drug during the titration phase (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the High negative affect group showed the most improvement in pain in the placebo condition (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Negative affect is associated with diminished benefit during a trial of opioid therapy and is predictive of dropout in a controlled clinical trial.","Jamison, Robert N; Edwards, Robert R; Liu, Xiaoxia; Ross, Edgar L; Michna, Edward; Warnick, Meredith; Wasan, Ajay D",Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1533-2500.2012.00575.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22681407/,81

Next-generation sequencing technologies have allowed us to identify somatic mutations that initiate BE and track genetic changes during development of tumors and invasive cancer. These technologies led to identification of mechanisms of tumorigenesis that challenge the current multistep model of progression to EA. Newer, cost-effective technologies create opportunities to rapidly translate the analysis of DNA into tools that can identify patients with BE at high risk for cancer, detect dysplastic lesions more reliably, and uncover mechanisms of carcinogenesis.","Contino, Gianmarco; Vaughan, Thomas L; Whiteman, David; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C",Gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2017.07.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28716721/,81

79489,CPAP Devices for Emergency Prehospital Use: A Bench Study.,2015,"OBJECTIVES As with colonoscopy, adequate bowel cleansing is essential prior to colon capsule endoscopy (CCE). Because CCE requires that the capsule traverse the entire gastrointestinal tract during the examination, laxative 'boosters' are used. The objective of this prospective, single-center, single-arm study was to evaluate the safety of a bowel preparation consisting of polyethylene glycol (PEG) plus an oral sulfate solution. METHODS Subjects were healthy volunteers aged 50-75 years old with normal baseline serum chemistry. The bowel preparation consisted of 4 Senna tablets, 4 liters of PEG (split dose), 10 mg metoclopramide, 2 oral sulfate solution boosters (6 oz. and 3 oz.), and 10 mg bisacodyl. Serum chemistry was performed at baseline, following PEG intake, 24 hours after bisacodyl administration, and at 7 days post procedure (in subjects with abnormal 24 hour results). The primary endpoints were the percentage of subjects with a clinically significant change in serum chemistry at the last test and the adverse event (AE) rate. RESULTS A total of 25 subjects were enrolled. The serum chemistry was normal in all subjects at the final evaluation. One subject showed a slight elevation in creatinine (1.08 mg/dl 7 days post procedure from 0.84 mg/dl at baseline), deemed not clinically significant. Another subject had a transient elevation in serum creatinine (from 1.01 mg/dl at baseline to 1.45 mg/dl at 24 hours after the bowel preparation); values returned to near baseline at 7 days post procedure (1.06 mg/dl). There were no serious AEs, three moderate AEs related to the bowel preparation (nausea, headache, elevated creatinine) and two mild unrelated AEs (chills, abdominal cramping). CONCLUSIONS A bowel cleansing regimen of PEG plus an oral sulfate solution can be used in healthy volunteers. These data provide support for the continued study of this regimen in future CCE clinical trials and in medical practice.","Kashyap, Pankaj K; Peled, Ravit",Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1177/1756283x15586355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26327914/,81

Methods: Patients with severe COPD (mean FEV1 = 23 ± 6% predicted) undergoing LVRS evaluation were recruited. Spirometry, plethysmography and exercise capacity were obtained within 6 months pre-LVRS and again within 12 months post- LVRS. Ventilatory mechanics were quantified using stationary optoelectronic plethysmography (OEP) during spontaneous tidal breathing and during maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV). Statistical significance was set at P< 0.05. Results:Ten consecutive patients met criteria for LVRS (5 females, 5 males, age: 62±6yrs). Post -LVRS (mean follow up 7 months ± 2 months), the group showed significant improvements in dyspnea scores (pre 4±1 versus post 2 ± 2), peak exercise workload (pre 37± 21 watts versus post 50 ± 27watts ), heart rate (pre 109±19 beats per minutes [bpm] versus post 118±19 bpm), duty cycle (pre 30.8 ± 3.8% versus post 38.0 ± 5.7%), and spirometric measurements (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] pre 23 ± 6% versus post 32 ± 13%, total lung capacity / residual lung volume pre 50 ± 8 versus 50 ± 11) . Six to 12 month changes in OEP measurements were observed in an increased percent contribution of the abdomen compartment during tidal breathing (41.2±6.2% versus 44.3±8.9%, P=0.03) and in percent contribution of the pulmonary ribcage compartment during MVV (34.5±10.3 versus 44.9±11.1%, P=0.02). Significant improvements in dynamic hyperinflation during MVV occurred, demonstrated by decreases rather than increases in end expiratory volume (EEV) in the pulmonary ribcage (pre 207.0 ± 288.2 ml versus post -85.0 ± 255.9 ml) and abdominal ribcage compartments (pre 229.1 ± 182.4 ml versus post -17.0 ± 136.2 ml) during the maneuver. Conclusions: Post-LVRS, patients with severe COPD demonstrate significant favorable changes in ventilatory mechanics, during tidal and maximal voluntary breathing. Future work is necessary to determine if these findings are clinically relevant, and extend to other environments such as exercise.","Layton, Aimee M; Armstrong, Hilary F; Moran, Sienna L; Guenette, Jordan A; Thomashow, Byron M; Jellen, Patricia A; Bartels, Matthew N; Sheel, A William; Basner, Robert C",Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases,https://doi.org/10.15326/jcopdf.2.1.2014.0145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28848831/,81
83787,Liberal Manipulation of Ventilator Settings and Its Impact on Tracheostomy Rate and Ventilator-Free Days.,2016,"BACKGROUND Although respiratory problems are by far the most frequent complications of pediatric anesthesia, there are currently no reliable data on the incidence of perioperative hypoxemia in children. Most studies investigating the incidence of pediatric respiratory complications were based on self-report. METHODS We studied the incidence of intraoperative hypoxemia as well as that of pulse oximeter artifacts prospectively in 575 pediatric noncardiac surgery patients aged between 0 and 16 years operated in a tertiary pediatric university hospital. Subsequently, the incidence of intraoperative hypoxemia was determined retrospectively in 8277 patients registered in an anesthesia information management system (AIMS) of the same hospital. RESULTS In the prospective cohort, at least 1 episode of oxygen saturation (Spo2) ≤ 90% for at least 1 minute occurred in 69 of 575 cases (12%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9%-15%). Furthermore, in 35 of 575 (6%; 95% CI, 4%-8%) cases at least 1 true hypoxemic event was observed. In total, 117 episodes of Spo2 ≤ 90% were observed in the prospective study, of which 3 of 117 could not be specified and 67 of 114 (54%; 95% CI, 42%-65%) episodes were classified as true hypoxemia. False-positive low Spo2 values were mainly caused by dislodgment of the pulse oximeter. In the retrospective analysis, Spo2 ≤ 90% and Spo2 ≤ 80% for at least 1 minute were documented in the AIMS in 18% (95% CI, 17%-19%) and 7.5% (95% CI, 7%-8%) of the cases, respectively; 31 and 10 episodes per 100 cases, respectively. The incidence of hypoxemia increased in younger age groups: Spo2 ≤ 90% for at least 1 minute occurred in 56% (95% CI, 49%-63%) of neonates (170 episodes per 100 cases). CONCLUSIONS The incidence of intraoperative hypoxemia increased with younger age, with the highest incidence in neonates. Because of the high artifact rate, unvalidated pulse oximeter data in AIMS should be interpreted with caution because only up to 65% of all hypoxemic episodes recorded during pediatric anesthesia were caused by true hypoxia.","de Graaff, Jurgen C; Bijker, Jilles B; Kappen, T H; van Wolfswinkel, Leo; Zuithoff, Nicolaas P A; Kalkman, Cor J",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e31829332b5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23687233/,81

Several methodological variations introduced over the years have led the scientific community to question replication between studies. In this systematic review, we used the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) to synthesize procedure-related data available about the TSST protocol to highlight commonalities and differences across studies. We noted significant discrepancies across studies in how researchers applied the TSST protocol. In particular, we highlight variations in testing procedures (e.g., number of judges, initial number in the arithmetic task, time of the collected saliva samples for cortisol) and discuss possible misinterpretation in comparing findings from studies failing to control for variables or using a modified version from the original protocol. Further, we recommend that researchers use a standardized background questionnaire when using the TSST to identify factors that may influence physiological measurements in tandem with a summary of this review as a protocol guide. More systematic implementation and detailed reporting of TSST methodology will promote study replication, optimize comparison of findings, and foster an informed understanding of factors affecting responses to social stressors in healthy people and those with pathological conditions.","Narvaez Linares, N F; Charron, V; Ouimet, A J; Labelle, P R; Plamondon, H",Neurobiology of stress,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ynstr.2020.100235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33344691/,81

This ecological study aimed to analyze the spatial distribution of the incidence of COVID-19 cases in a Brazilian metropolis and its association with social vulnerability indicators. Spatial scan analysis was used to identify COVID-19 clusters. The variables for identifying the vulnerability were inserted in a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model to identify their spatial relationship with COVID-19 cases. The incidence of COVID-19 in Fortaleza was 74.52/10,000 inhabitants, with 3,554 reported cases and at least one case registered in each neighborhood. The spatial GWR showed a negative relationship between the incidence of COVID-19 and demographic density (β=-0,0002) and a positive relationship between the incidence of COVID-19 and the percentage of self-employed >18 years (β=1.40), and maximum per capita household income of the poorest fifth (β=0.04).

The literature review includes publications available in the PubMed bibliographic database, describing symptoms and complaints of mask users (e.g., the feeling of discomfort, fatigue, headaches), different physiological reactions depending on the type of mask (surgical masks, masks with an exhalation valve, with air flow, etc.) as well as the influence of air composition, temperature and humidity in the space under the mask. The impact of using the mask on the ability to exercise (maximal effort, moderate effort) and mental work was outlined. The consequences of wearing masks by people in a different physiological state (pregnancy) were discussed. Proposals for the organization of work were also presented in order to minimize the negative consequences for people wearing masks. The analysis of the presented studies shows that, regardless of the type of masks worn, they can intensify the body's reactions to a varying degree, increasing the physiological cost of work and worsening the ability to make both physical and mental effort. In addition, the mask can contribute, among others, to more frequent headaches, symptoms of fatigue or the subjective feeling of discomfort. However, despite these adverse effects, the use of masks is important to protect people against harmful factors in the work and communal environments, and during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it has become a necessity. The discomfort of wearing a mask can be reduced by taking appropriate breaks. It should be emphasized that the rhythm of work and breaks in wearing the mask should take into account the individual limitations of the employee.

METHODS All consecutive patients treated with RFA for liver tumours between January 2009 and October 2012 were included. Previously treated lesions that progressed were excluded. Using electronic medical records, the following data was captured: patient demographics, pre-procedural laboratory results, Child-Pugh status, tumour characteristics, development of tumoral seeding, RFA complications and LTP. Possible risk factors for LTP were identified using Cox regression. RESULTS In total, 555 liver tumours were treated in 337 patients. 483 (87.0%) hepatocellular carcinomas, 52 (9.4%) colorectal metastases and 20 (3.6%) other tumour types were treated. Mean tumour size was 2.1 ± 1.1 (range 0.4-6.8) cm. Mean follow-up duration was 387 days. 416 (75.0%) lesions had no LTP at the last imaging. 70 (12.6%) patients had minor complications requiring observation, while 7 (1.3%) patients had significant complications requiring prolonged hospitalisation or further interventions. Only one case of tumour seeding was detected. Using multivariate Cox regression, the following factors were statistically significant in predicting LTP: hilar location (relative ratio [RR] 3.988), colorectal metastases (RR 2.075), size (RR 1.290) and younger age (RR 0.982). CONCLUSION RFA of liver tumours is safe and effective, with a low significant complication rate of 1.3%.

However, the optimal approach for RP has not been established. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to introduce the posterior and lateral approaches for RP. METHODS This prospective study included 19 patients with suspected pancreatic lesions who underwent RP. RP was performed using either a posterior or a lateral approach. RESULTS The posterior, lateral, and jointed approaches were used in 13 (68.4 %), 3 (15.8 %), and 3 (15.8 %) cases, respectively. Patients underwent enucleation (N = 8), distal pancreatectomy (N = 4), and resection of cystic pancreatic lesions (N = 2) and non-pancreatic lesions (N = 5). All retroperitoneoscopic procedures were successfully accomplished with no conversion to open or laparoscopic surgery. Intraoperative complications occurred in two (12.5 %) cases, including one case with injury to the peritoneum and one case with injury to the peritoneum and splenic vein. Postoperative grade A pancreatic fistulas occurred in six cases, and were cured by delayed drainage. No disease recurrence or abnormal symptoms were observed during the mean follow-up period of 14.06 ± 9.60 months. CONCLUSIONS RP using the posterior or lateral approach is feasible and effective, but has different indications. The posterior approach is useful for distal pancreatectomy, as well as resection of pancreatic lesions in the posterior or superoposterior region of the distal pancreas. The lateral approach is useful for resection of pancreatic lesions in the anterior or inferior region of the body and tail. The two approaches can be used in combination or conversion.","Zhao, Guodong; Hu, Minggen; Liu, Rong; Zhiming, Zhao; Xu, Yong; Zhou, Huinian; Wang, Xuefei; Zhang, Xinning",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-014-2654-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867472/,81

105932,Serial Weekly Measurements of the Timed Inspiratory Effort Index Can Predict Successful Prolonged Weaning.,2019,"Hemostatic materials is increasingly important in civilian and military clinical. In this work, a hydrogel was fabricated from hydroxypropyl chitosan (HPCS) and soy protein isolate (SPI) via the crosslinking of epichlorohydrin. Effects of SPI content on the structure, physical and biological properties of the prepared hydrogels were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy, water uptake testing, mechanical properties testing, MTT assay, hemolysis ratio testing and routine blood coagulation test. The results indicated that the hydrogels showed high water uptake ability and compressive strength. The in vitro biocompatibility evaluation revealed that the hydrogel contains 30% SPI content (HCSH-30) could promote blood coagulation and cell proliferation. Furthermore, the hemostatic model of liver in New Zealand rabbit was applied to assess the hemostatic efficacy of the hydrogels. The results demonstrated that HCSH-30 stopped bleeding in 75±1.63 s and improved hemostasis as compared to medical gauze. Thus, the hydroxypropyl chitosan/soy protein isolate hydrogel is expected to be a potential candidate for effective hemorrhage control.","Zhao, Yanan; Xiao, Ao; Wu, Ping; Chen, Feixiang; Zhang, Qiang; Liang, Xiao; Han, Xinwei; Shi, Xiaowen; Li, Yinping; Chen, Yun",Tissue engineering.

Regarding a lack of information about perception of nursing students, as a part of healthcare workers, in this issue, the current study was aimed to explore the perceived consequences of self-medication from the perspective of nursing students. Methods This qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured individual face-to-face interviews. Purposeful sampling method was used for selection of participants. Twelve nursing students in the age range of 21-36 years were enrolled. Five participants were male and seven were female, seven master's degree and five were undergraduate of bachelor degree. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analyzed as content analyses. Results Two categories and seven sub-categories were emerged from the data analysis. The main categories included; positive consequences and negative consequences, and subcategories included; time saving, cost savings, disease treatment, harming the health system, drug resistance, physical complications and death. Conclusion The participants believed that self-medication has some positive and negative consequences in viewpoints of nursing students. Regarding, Self-medication that potentially has dangerous consequences, it is suggested the students will be educated and warned about the adverse effects of self-medication, and the nursing teachers should try to rectify students' misconceptions about self-medication.","Khatony, Alireza; Soroush, Ali; Andayeshgar, Bahare; Abdi, Alireza",BMC nursing,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-020-00460-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724298/,81
107518,Essential Pain Management: Perspective From Nepal.,2020-11-01,"OBJECTIVES To present our novel technique and step-by-step approach to bipolar diathermy circumcision and related procedures in adult males. METHODS We reviewed our technique of bipolar circumcision and related procedures in 54 cases over a 22-month period at our day procedure center. Bipolar diathermy cutting and hemostasis was performed using bipolar forceps with a Valleylab machine set at 15. Sleeve circumcision was used. A dorsal slit was made, followed by frenulum release and ventral slit, and was completed with bilateral circumferential cutting. Frenuloplasties released the frenulum. Preputioplasties used multiple 2-3 mm longitudinal cuts to release the constriction, with frenulum left intact. All wounds were closed with interrupted 4/0 Vicryl Rapide™. RESULTS A total of 54 nonemergency bipolar circumcision procedures were carried out from November 2010-August 2012 (42 circumcisions, eight frenuloplasties, and four preputioplasties). Patients were aged 18-72 years (mean, 34 years). There was minimal to no intraoperative bleeding in all cases, allowing for precise dissection. All patients were requested to attend outpatient reviews; three frenuloplasty and two circumcision patients failed to return. Of the remaining 49, mean interval to review was 49 days, with a range of 9-121 days. Two circumcision patients reported mild bleeding with nocturnal erections within a week postoperatively, but they did not require medical attention. Two others presented to family practitioners with possible wound infections which resolved with oral antibiotics. All 49 patients had well-healed wounds. CONCLUSION The bipolar diathermy technique is a simple procedure, easily taught, and reproducible. It is associated with minimal bleeding, is safe and efficient, uses routine operating equipment and is universally applicable to circumcision/frenuloplasty/preputioplasty. In addition, it has minimal postoperative complications, and has associated excellent cosmesis.","Nalavenkata, Sunny; Winter, Matthew; Kour, Rachel; Kour, Nam-Wee; Ruljancich, Paul",Research and reports in urology,https://doi.org/10.2147/rru.s58600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25032176/,81
109354,Noninvasive ventilation in chest trauma: systematic review and meta-analysis.,2013,"BACKGROUND Although minimally invasive rectal surgery (MIRS) for cancer provides better recovery for similar oncologic outcomes over open approach, conversion is still required in 10% and its impact on short-term and long-term outcomes remains unclear. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of conversion on postoperative and oncologic outcomes in patients undergoing MIRS for cancer. METHODS From June 2011 to March 2020, we reviewed 257 minimally invasive rectal resections for cancer recorded in a prospectively maintained database, with 192 robotic and 65 laparoscopic approaches. Patients who required conversion to open (Conversion group) were compared to those who did not have conversion (No conversion group) in terms of short-term, histologic, and oncologic outcomes. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the risk factors for postoperative morbidity were performed. RESULTS Eighteen patients (7%) required conversion. The conversion rate was significantly higher in the laparoscopic approach than in the robotic approach (16.9% vs 3.6%, p < 0.01). Among the 4 reactive conversions, 3 (75%) were required during robotic resections. Patients in the Conversion group had a higher morbidity rate (83.3% vs 43.1%, p = 0.01) and more severe complications (38.9%, vs 18.8%, p = 0.041). Male sex [HR = 2.46, 95%CI (1.41-4.26)], total mesorectal excision [HR = 2.89, 95%CI (1.57-5.320)], and conversion (HR = 4.87, 95%CI [1.34-17.73]) were independently associated with a higher risk of overall 30-day morbidity. R1 resections were more frequent in the Conversion group (22.2% vs 5.4%, p = 0.023) without differences in the overall (82.7 ± 7.0 months vs 79.4 ± 3.3 months, p = 0.448) and disease-free survivals (49.0 ± 8.6 months vs 70.2 ± 4.1 months, p = 0.362). CONCLUSION Conversion to laparotomy during MIRS for cancer was associated with poorer postoperative results without impairing oncologic outcomes. The high frequency of reactive conversion due to intraoperative complications in robotic resections confirmed that MIRS for cancer is a technically challenging procedure.","Abdalla, Solafah; Lupinacci, Renato M; Genova, Pietro; Oberlin, Olivier; Goasguen, Nicolas; Fabiani, Bettina; Valverde, Alain",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-021-08679-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34398282/,81
114013,Ischaemic stroke and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: fast-track single-stop approach.,2015,"INTRODUCTION A feedlot is an intensive farming system for finishing livestock. Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a cause of morbidity and mortality in beef cattle, especially in feedlots. METHODOLOGY This study investigated the morbidity and mortality of BRD in a beef cattle feedlot in southeastern Brazil using: clinical diagnoses, therapy, morbidity, and mortality. Pulmonary fragments were collected from five steers, on feed from 3-32 days, with lesions of pneumonia for identification of BRD infectious agents PCR. RESULTS 188,862 steers were on feed and morbidity was 7.05% (13,315/188,862), mortality 0.64% (1,214/188,862). The causes of morbidity were: BRD (6.13%), lameness (0.29%), trauma (0.21%), clostridiosis (0.13%) and polioencephalomalacia, PEM (0.12%). The causes of mortality were: BRD (0.21%), trauma (0.17%), and clostridiosis (0.13%). When all sick cattle were considered (n=13,315), BRD (86.9%) was the principal cause of morbidity, followed by lameness (4.13%), trauma (3.05%), and clostridiosis (1.82%). The cost of BRD-associated cattle mortality and morbidity was estimated at $14,334.00/10,000 and $16,315.40/10,000 respectively. It was projected that the economic effects due to BRD-associated morbidity in Brazil were $6.31 million/annum, while losses due to mortality were $5.54 million, resulting in an annual loss of $11.85 million. Coinfections in cattle with pneumonia due to Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida were identified in 4/5 steers tested. CONCLUSIONS This is the first longitudinal study that investigated the incidence of BRD in feedlot cattle from Brazil, and the results herein described indicate that BRD contributed significantly to the development of mortality and morbidity of cattle on feed.","Baptista, Anderson Lopes; Rezende, Amanda Lima; Fonseca, Pedro de Almeida; Massi, Rodrigo Pelisson; Nogueira, Geison Morel; Magalhães, Layane Queiroz; Headley, Selwyn Arlington; Menezes, Guilherme Lobato; Alfieri, Amauri Alcindo; Saut, João Paulo Elsen",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.9296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600152/,81
117368,Clinical Pathway for Management of Suspected or Positive Novel Coronavirus-19 Patients With ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction.,2020-04-23,"OBJECTIVE With the COVID-19 pandemic chemosensory dysfunction are among the most prevalent symptoms. Most reports are subjective evaluations, which has been suggested to be unreliable. The objective is to test chemosensory dysfunction and recovery based on extensive psychophysical tests in COVID-19 during the course of the disease. METHODS 111 patients from four centres participated in the study. All tested positive for SARS-COV-2 with RT-PCR. They were tested within three days of diagnosis and 28 to 169 days after infection. Testing included extensive olfactory testing with the Sniffin' Sticks test for threshold, discrimination and identification abilities, and with the Taste Sprays and Taste Strips for gustatory function for quasi-threshold and taste identification abilities. RESULTS There was a significant difference in olfactory function during and after infection. During infection 21% were anosmic, 49% hyposmic and 30% normosmic. After infection only 1% were anosmic, 26% hyposmic and 73% normosmic. For gustatory function there was a difference for all taste qualities, but significantly in sour, bitter and total score. 26% had gustatory dysfunction during infection and 6.5% had gustatory dysfunction after infection. Combining all tests 22% had combined olfactory and gustatory dysfunction during infection. After infection no patients had combined dysfunction. CONCLUSION Chemosensory dysfunction is very common in COVID-19, either as isolated smell or taste dysfunction or a combined dysfunction. Most people regain their chemosensory function within the first 28 days, but a quarter of the patients show persisting dysfunction, which should be referred to specialist smell and taste clinics for rehabilitation of chemosensory function.","Niklassen, Andreas Steenholt; Draf, Julia; Huart, Caroline; Hintschich, Constantin; Bocksberger, Simone; Trecca, Eleonora Maria Consiglia; Klimek, Ludger; Le Bon, Serge D; Altundag, Aytug; Hummel, Thomas",The Laryngoscope,https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.29383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33404079/,81

While initial educational priorities focused on creating a more agile workforce with better cross-specialty skill-mix, attention must now shift to how our system can prepare a proportionate response that not only addresses the needs of the pandemic but also the underlying challenges of healthcare: multimorbidity, bridging the evidence-practice gap and delivering integrated, personalised medicine for all. It is our contention that meeting such challenges will require a rapid upskilling of the digital capabilities of the healthcare workforce. In short, optimising the health of the nation will depend, in part, on improving the digital health of the workforce. In this review, we examine how digital technology played its part in the COVID-19 response, and how fundamental changes to medical training are urgently needed in the context of a 'healthcare reset'. Familiarity with health informatics, data science and digital technology have to move to centre stage in order to future-proof our profession in the years to come.

118540,Measurement of Diaphragmatic Electrical Activity by Surface Electromyography in Intubated Subjects and Its Relationship With Inspiratory Effort.,2018,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of the vaginoscopic approach to office hysteroscopy on patients' experience of pain, when compared with the traditional approach where a vaginal speculum is used. METHODS Medline, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane library were searched from inception until December 2019, in order to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomised controlled trials investigating vaginoscopy compared to traditional hysteroscopy on pain experienced by women undergoing diagnostic or operative hysteroscopy in an office setting. Data regarding procedural time, feasibility, incidence of vasovagal reactions and complications, acceptability and satisfaction were also recorded. RESULTS The literature search returned 363 results of which seven were selected for systematic review, and six for meta-analysis. The vaginoscopic approach was associated with a statistically significant reduction in pain (4 studies including 2214 patients; SMD -0.27, 95 % CI -0.48 to -0.06), procedural time (6 studies including 2443 patients; SMD -0.25, 95 % CI -0.43 to -0.08) and the incidence of vasovagal episodes (3 studies including 2127 patients; OR 0.35; 95 % CI 0.15 to 0.82). Failure rates between the two techniques were similar (p = .90). No study reported significant differences in complications or patient or clinician acceptability or satisfaction. CONCLUSION Clinicians performing office hysteroscopy should use the vaginoscopic technique because it makes office hysteroscopy quicker, less painful and reduces the likelihood of inducing a vasovagal reaction. The traditional approach should only be used when vaginoscopy fails or when the need for cervical dilatation is anticipated.","De Silva, Prathiba M; Carnegy, Alasdair; Smith, Paul P; Clark, T Justin","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.06.045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645643/,81
118904,Effects of sedatives and opioids on trigger and cycling asynchronies throughout mechanical ventilation: an observational study in a large dataset from critically ill patients.,2019,"There is growing implementation of storytelling as a specific application of narrative in public health. As the field's latest epoch evolves to consider cultural determinants, reimagination of how scientists conceptualize, operationalize, and capture populations' unique elements is necessary, and storytelling provides a genuine and efficacious methodology that can assist with that reimagination. Professionals are creating more spaces that demonstrate how storytelling elucidates, promotes, and supports contextual factors that are not captured by orthodox methodologies. However, more opportunities are needed to exhibit storytelling's impact on capturing the nuances in human experiences, such as those of historically and systemically underrepresented populations. This study synthesizes the past decade of research in public health and related fields that primarily utilized storytelling and reports significant implications. Additionally, this study highlights explorations in public health that primarily use storytelling as a research and practice approach. Each case study includes a description of the background and aims, elaborates on storytelling's utilization, and discusses findings, observations, and future directions. Finally, this study discusses conceptual issues in public health raised by use of storytelling, such as how to best capture impact on human beings and the importance of context. This article's goal is to present current evidence of critical reevaluations to the epistemological, conceptual, and practical paradigms within public health through storytelling. Additionally, this article aims to provide support and empowerment to public health scientists considering creative approaches to better acknowledge and appreciate humanity's inherent subjectivity.","Fakunle, David O; Thomas Mph, David T; Gonzales, Kathy A M; Vidot, Denise C; Johnson, LaShaune P",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,https://doi.org/10.1177/10901981211009741; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34080473/,81

Recent work suggested that mismatch repair deficient CRCs may not benefit from 5FU adjuvant chemotherapy but studies remain conflicting. We aimed to determine if gender, tumor site, tumor pathological characteristics and microsatellite instability (MSI) predict survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in stage C CRC. METHODS Data were collated on ACPS (Australian Clinico-pathological Staging System) stage C CRC cases that underwent curative resection over a 23-year period. Pathology was reevaluated, DNA was extracted from the formalin-fixed paraffin specimen, and MSI status was established by BAT26 instability. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazard model and effects modification interaction testing. RESULTS In total 814 unselected cases were included, of whom 37% received chemotherapy. Seventy-seven cases exhibited MSI. Overall, adjuvant chemotherapy produced a cancer-specific survival benefit (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39-0.70; P < 0.0001). On interaction testing, none of the examined parameters significantly influenced the magnitude of that survival benefit. Chemotherapy was beneficial in both the MSI (HR 0.08, 95% CI 0.02-0.27; P = < 0.0001) and the microsatellite stable cohort (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47-0.81; P = 0.001). CONCLUSION These results suggest that survival benefit from 5FU adjuvant chemotherapy for stage C CRC does not vary according to gender, site of tumor, pathological characteristics or MSI status. This study suggests that it would be unwise to exclude patients from being offered adjuvant chemotherapy on the basis of MSI.","Thomas, Michelle L; Hewett, Peter J; Ruszkiewicz, Andrew R; Moore, James W E",Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajco.12411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26471980/,81

The Closure Fast™ catheter heats the vein wall to 120°C, causing denaturation of the collagen of the vein wall and contraction of the vessel such that no blood can flow through it. Nearly one million systems have been sold since the product was launched. Many, if not all, patients can be treated under local anesthesia with the Closure Fast™ catheter. Duplex ultrasound reports occlusion rates for the treated vein of 94%-98% at 1 year and 85%-93% at 3 years. The system produces average postoperative pain scores of less than 2 out of 10 on a visual analog score. In the first postoperative week, 76% of patients do not require analgesia. Some 45% of patients return to normal activity on the first postoperative day. Serious complications appear to be rare following the Closure Fast™ procedure. Transient paresthesia occurs in 0.2% of cases, thrombophlebitis in 1%-10%, and thromboembolic events in up to 1.4%, mainly heat-induced thrombosis. Closure Fast™ adds significant costs to treating superficial venous disease but studies have shown it to be cost-effective when used in an office setting.","Braithwaite, Simon A; Braithwaite, Bruce D",Medical devices,https://doi.org/10.2147/mder.s48141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24940086/,81

With this technique, we temporarily change the Borden classification from type II to type III, avoiding venous compromise and reducing the risk of Onyx migration into the patent sinus. A 54-year-old man presented with left persistent tinnitus of 4 months' duration. Cerebral angiography revealed a Borden type II left lateral tentorial sinus-DAVF associated with retrograde cortical venous reflux draining into the vein of Labbé. In the venous phase, the ipsilateral transverse-sigmoid sinus was recognized as a functional sinus and the posterior temporal vein drained into the transverse sinus near the drainage channel. We planned to perform transarterial Onyx embolization using a short-length sinus protection balloon to protect against Onyx migration. During transarterial Onyx injection, a 7 × 7-mm HyperForm balloon was navigated into the affected sinus and positioned to cover the drainage channel from the shunt. After confirming the change in Borden classification with angiography, transarterial Onyx embolization was performed via the middle meningeal artery. This procedure resulted in complete obliteration of the fistula with good patency of both the transverse-sigmoid sinus and neighboring normal cortical veins. No procedure-related complications were observed and the patient remained free of recurrence during the 24-month follow-up period. Short-length balloon-protected Onyx embolization can be safe and effective for the treatment of Borden type II DAVF.","Matsuo, Kazuya; Fujita, Atsushi; Kohta, Masaaki; Kohmura, Eiji",Radiology case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radcr.2020.01.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32071660/,81

125186,Respiratory Support during Bronchiolitis Due to One Virus versus More Than One Virus: An Observational Study.,2019,"INTRODUCTION Although its excellent results, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) presents major complications ranging from 0% to 29%. Among them, the staple line leak presents an incidence varying from 0% to 7%. Many trials debated about different solutions in order to reduce leaks' incidence. No author has investigated the role of gastric decompression in the prevention of this complication. Aim of our work is to evaluate if this procedure can play a role in avoiding the occurrence of staple line leaks after LSG. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between January 2008 and November 2012, 145 patients were prospectively and randomly included in the study. Seventy patients composed the group A, whose operations were completed with placement of nasogastric tube; the other 75 patients were included in the group B, in which no nasogastric tube was placed. RESULTS No statistical differences were observed between group A and group B regarding gender distribution, age, weight, and BMI. No intraoperative complications and no conversion occurred in both groups. Intraoperative blood loss (50.1 ± 42.3 vs. 52.5 ± 37.6 ml, respectively) and operative time (65.4 ± 25.5 vs. 62.6 ± 27.8 min, respectively) were comparable between the two groups (p: NS). One staple line leak (1.4%) occurred on 6th postoperative day in group A patients. No leak was observed in group B patients. Postoperative hospital stay was significantly longer in group A vs. group B patients (7.6 ± 3.4 vs. 6.2 ± 3.1 days, respectively, p: 0.04). CONCLUSIONS Routine placement of nasogastric tube in patients operated of LSG seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence.","Rossetti, Gianluca; Fei, Landino; Docimo, Ludovico; Del Genio, Gianmattia; Micanti, Fausta; Belfiore, Annamaria; Brusciano, Luigi; Moccia, Francesco; Cimmino, Marco; Marra, Teresa",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,https://doi.org/10.3109/08941939.2013.875606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24476003/,81

Two-thirds of those surveyed reported some type of distress related to the pandemic (i.e. difficulty coping or negative impact on emotional and mental health). While there were no changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms from prior to COVID-19 to 10 week later in the group as a whole, self-reported distress predicted increases in both anxiety and depression across the two timepoints. Furthermore, adults with higher levels of anxiety prior to the pandemic were more likely to report distress, and women were more likely to report a negative impact of the pandemic on their emotional and mental health.

127164,Treatment targets based on autoregulation parameters in neurocritical care patients.,2020-02-04,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a popular stand-alone bariatric surgery, despite a paucity of long-term data. Hence, this study is to report the long-term outcome of LSG as primary bariatric procedure and the result of revisional surgery. METHODS With retrospective analysis of a prospective bariatric database, participants who defaulted clinic follow-up were interviewed by telephone. A total of 667 LSG was performed as primary bariatric procedure (2006-2012) with mean age of 34.5 ± 9.7 years old, female 74.7%, mean body mass index (BMI) 37.3 ± 8.1 kg/m(2). A 36-F bougie was used for all cases. RESULTS There were 61 patients available with long-term data. The weight loss outcome at 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years showed a mean BMI 26.3, 25.2, 25.3, 27.1, and 26.2 with mean excess weight loss (EWL) 76.0%, 79.6%, 77.3%, 73.4%, and 72.6% respectively. However, 17% patients developed de novo gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Eighteen patients (2.2%) needed surgical revisions due to weight regain (n = 6), persistent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; n = 2), stricture (n = 2), and GERD (n = 8). The revision resulted in an additional mean excess weight loss of 23.8% with mean BMI 24.9 kg/m(2) at 6 months postoperatively. There was a 23.7% mean reduction of HbA1c with one patient who was in complete diabetic remission at 1 year. CONCLUSION Our results showed LSG is a durable bariatric procedure with > 70% EWL at 5 years despite a high incidence of GERD. The need for revision of LSG is low and mainly for GERD.","Pok, Eng-Hong; Lee, Wei-Jei; Ser, Kong-Han; Chen, Jung-Chien; Chen, Shu-Chun; Tsou, Ju-Juin; Chin, Kin-Fah",Asian journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asjsur.2015.03.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25964106/,81

The cellular protein elongation factor eEF1A could be a good target. Among its natural inhibitors are didemnins and their related chemical compounds such as plitidepsin. In human cell culture, this compound is capable of inhibiting the virus with a potency 27,5 times that of remdesivir. It must be administered intravenously. Of the ribonucleoside analogues, molnupiravir (MK-4483/EIDD-2801) (hydroxy-cytidine) determines a lethal mutagenesis on SARS-CoV-2. In animals, after oral administration, the pulmonary viral load decreases 25,000 times and when administered as prophylaxis, approximately 100,000 times. It prevents the transmission of the virus and eliminates its presence in the oropharynx.

128813,Myocardial Infarction with and without ST-segment Elevation: a Contemporary Reappraisal of Similarities and Differences.,2020-12-10,"BACKGROUND There has been a recent recognized shift towards a whole-of-life or life-course approach to immunisation. However, coverage amongst at-risk adults for recommended vaccines continues to be suboptimal. This study examined the perceptions of middle and older aged Australian adults towards hospital-based immunization programs and their previous exposures to receiving vaccines via tertiary care. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted with Australian adults 45 years and older in late 2019 to capture influenza and pneumococcal vaccine uptake, exposure to hospital-based immunization programs, missed opportunities to vaccinate and receptiveness towards the promotion and/or delivery of vaccines in the hospital setting. RESULTS Only 13 respondents reported receiving a vaccine at hospital, yet 72.2% (931/1292) indicated that they were willing to be vaccinated in that setting. Amongst those who attended hospital during 2019 and were eligible for vaccination, 57.2% and 28.3% of respondents were not immunized for pneumococcal and influenza, respectively. Missed opportunities for both vaccines were significantly higher amongst those at low-risk for influenza (≤65 years (low-risk): 52.9%, ≤65 years (high-risk): 18.3%, >65 years: 15.1%; p < 0.001) and pneumococcal (≤65 years (low-risk): 79.1%, ≤65 years (high-risk): 52.4%, >65 years: 44%; p < 0.001). Among those with a missed opportunity for hospital-based vaccination, the most common reason for not getting immunized was a lack of recommendation. Most (86.4%) reported that their general practitioner was the person or group they trusted most to receive vaccine information from. CONCLUSIONS The findings from this Australian study support international work that shows very low rates of opportunistic vaccination in hospitals despite national recommendations to vaccinate prior to discharge. Considering the need for high levels of uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine, hospitals may need to be considered to opportunistically capture those not accessing the vaccine in other settings.","McFadden, Kathleen; Heywood, Anita; Dyda, Amalie; Kaufman, Jessica; Seale, Holly",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.05.027; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34024659/,81

132080,Membrane-Based Therapeutic Plasma Exchange in Intensive Care.,2020-10-22,"In case of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear emergency, there are recommended or required behaviours to be adopted by the public, e.g. go inside, stay inside, stay informed. The initial response can be crucial to outcomes, all the while recognising that changes may be needed as the emergency progresses. The recent coronavirus pandemic demonstrated how the course of action taken by authorities endorsing these protective behaviours early on can save thousands of lives. Factors that determine response success include public compliance with authorities' recommendations and cooperation between experts and rescuers. In particular, the way rescuers perceive the risks of ionising radiation hazards will influence their preparedness to respond in case of a radiological or nuclear emergency. Having found no previous studies on radiological hazard and risk perception amongst rescuers in Portugal, mental models were used as a descriptive approach. The target groups were firefighters and the military formally trained to deal with radiation hazard emergencies. Their representations of radiological hazards and risks were analysed in the light of an expert model built ad hoc. The results show several overlays between experts and rescuers on the understanding of radiation hazards and potential risks. We conclude that the main gap between radiation risk perceptions by rescuers and experts involves the concepts and mechanisms of radiation contamination and its spread among individuals, in particular, if persons exposed to radioactive sources may also become a radioactive source themselves. This gap can have practical implications for an emergency response.","Melo, Ana Rita; Silva, Rui M C; Palma-Oliveira, José Manuel; Martins, Décio Ruivo",Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6498/abbb26; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111712/,81

This study aimed to obtain a taste-masked formulation of TMS by hot melt extrusion (HME) technology and to investigate the formulation's characterization, stability, and effects in vitro/in vivo. Eudragit® E PO was selected as the carrier, and TMS dissolution in artificial saliva was used as a reference. The HME parameters were optimized via an orthogonal design. The optimized results were as follows: 135 ℃ extrusion temperature, 100 rpm screw speed and 30 % drug load. The masking efficiency of the formulation was evaluated by both simulated oral drug release in vitro and electronic tongue tests. The release of the taste-masked formulation in artificial saliva medium was significantly reduced within 60 s (less than 2%), while the release in 0.1 M HCl buffer was fast (more than 80 %) within 30 min. As suggested by the results of the electronic tongue, the taste-masked formulation had a better taste-masked effect than the commercial premix and the commercial enteric granules. Finally, a pharmacokinetic study was performed. Analysis of variance demonstrated that the pharmacokinetic behavior of the TMS taste-masked formulation was similar to that of the commercial premix, while the absorption effect was better than that of the commercially available enteric granules. This research indicates that the taste-masked formulation has the potential for future commercialization.","Yan, Guoqing; Liang, Qiuling; Wen, Xuemei; Peng, Jianbo; Deng, Ruihan; Lv, Li; Ji, Min; Deng, Xin; Wu, Liqin; Feng, Xin; He, Jiakang","Colloids and surfaces.

133998,Mortality of Older Patients Admitted to an ICU: A Systematic Review.,2020-12-16,"Background: Meeting the needs of people bereaved by COVID-19 poses a substantial challenge to palliative care. The Pandemic Grief Scale (PGS) is a 5-item mental health screener to identify probable cases of dysfunctional grief during the pandemic. Objective: The PGS has strong psychometric and diagnostic features. The objective was to examine the incremental validity of the PGS in identifying mourners at risk of harmful outcomes. Design: A cross-sectional survey design involving sociodemographic questions and self-report measures of pandemic grief, generalized anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, separation distress, functional impairment, meaning-making difficulties, and substance use coping. Setting/Subjects: A sample of people bereaved through COVID-19 (N = 1065) in the United States. Results: Fully 56.6% of participants scored above the cut score of ≥7 on the PGS for clinically dysfunctional pandemic grief and 69.7% coped with their loss using drugs or alcohol for at least several days in past two weeks. PGS scores were not associated with time since loss. Hierarchical multiple regression models demonstrated that the PGS uniquely explained variance in functional impairment, meaning-making difficulties, and substance use coping, over relevant background factors, bereavement-related psychopathology, and separation distress. In the final model, the standardized regression coefficients for the PGS were 2-15 times larger than for the other competing measures in explaining each of the three outcomes. Conclusions: The findings underscore the clinical utility of this short and easy-to-use measure in identifying risk of deleterious outcomes across a range of functional and behavioral domains.","Lee, Sherman A; Neimeyer, Robert A; Breen, Lauren J",Journal of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1089/jpm.2021.0103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33926228/,81

Environmental scientists and engineers familiar with the techniques required for this endeavor have responded. Many of the environmental scientists engaged in these investigations have not necessarily had experience with the ethical obligations associated with generating and handling human health data. The Canadian Water Network facilitated adoption of these surveillance methods by creating a national coalition, which included a public health advisory group that recognized a need for ethics guidance for the wastewater approach to public health surveillance. This Policy Analysis addresses that need and is based on a review of relevant ethics literature tightly focused on ethics applicable to public health surveillance. That review revealed that classical health bioethics governing clinical practice and general public health ethics guidance did not adequately address key issues in wastewater surveillance.

This study investigated the correlation between differentially expressed proteins in serum and CP induced by all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in mice. We studied 80 mice in the following groups: male mice (male; n = 6), nonpregnant female control mice (NP-CRL; n = 6), healthy pregnant controls (P-CRL; Con; n = 24), pregnant mice with CP induced by atRA (n = 24), or pregnant mice with CP induced by TCDD (TCDD; n = 20). Pregnant mice were given with atRA (100 mg/kg) or TCDD (40 μg/kg), or corn oil by oral gavage at E10.5. The serum samples were collected and eight proteins-including interleukin (IL)-12p40, IL-12p70, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), interferon (IFN)-γ, IFN-β, IL-10, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and epiregulin-were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Placental tissues were immunostained for IL-12p40 and RAGE from stages E13.5 to E16.5. In P-CRL mice, serum IL-12p40 was significantly increased at E13.5 and declined over E14.5-E16.5. P-CRL had lower IFN-γ levels at E13.5 compared with NP-CRL. The CP groups showed lower concentrations of IL-12p40 at E13.5-E14.5 and clearly higher concentrations of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) at E13.5 when compared with P-CRL. IL-12p40 immunostaining clearly decreased in placental tissue sections obtained from E13.5 to E14.5 in both CP groups. These findings suggest that reduced levels of IL-12p40 and increased levels of sRAGE in serum may be correlated with chemically induced CP in mice, but further studies would be required to establish this.","Wang, X-H; Peng, Y; Meng, L-Y",Human & experimental toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0960327120937342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633565/,81

OBJECTIVE We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the safety and accuracy of percutaneous RTB for the diagnosis of malignancy, histologic tumour subtype, and grade. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies providing data on diagnostic accuracy and complications of percutaneous core biopsy (CB) or fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of renal tumours. A meta-analysis was performed to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of malignancy. The Cohen kappa coefficient (κ) was estimated for the analysis of histotype/grade concordance between diagnosis on RTB and surgical specimen. Risk of bias assessment was performed (QUADAS-2). EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS A total of 57 studies recruiting 5228 patients were included. The overall median diagnostic rate of RTB was 92%. The sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic CBs and FNAs were 99.1% and 99.7%, and 93.2% and 89.8%, respectively. A good (κ = 0.683) and a fair (κ = 0.34) agreement were observed between histologic subtype and Fuhrman grade on RTB and surgical specimen, respectively. A very low rate of Clavien ≥ 2 complications was reported. Study limitations included selection and differential-verification bias. CONCLUSIONS RTB is safe and has a high diagnostic yield in experienced centres. Both CB and FNA have good accuracy for the diagnosis of malignancy and histologic subtype, with better performance for CB. The accuracy for Fuhrman grade is fair. Overall, the quality of the evidence was moderate. Prospective cohort studies recruiting consecutive patients and using homogeneous reference standards are required. PATIENT SUMMARY We systematically reviewed the literature to assess the safety and diagnostic performance of renal tumour biopsy (RTB). The results suggest that RTB has good accuracy in diagnosing renal cancer and its subtypes, and it appears to be safe. However, the quality of evidence was moderate, and better quality studies are required to provide a more definitive answer.","Marconi, Lorenzo; Dabestani, Saeed; Lam, Thomas B; Hofmann, Fabian; Stewart, Fiona; Norrie, John; Bex, Axel; Bensalah, Karim; Canfield, Steven E; Hora, Milan; Kuczyk, Markus A; Merseburger, Axel S; Mulders, Peter F A; Powles, Thomas; Staehler, Michael; Ljungberg, Borje; Volpe, Alessandro",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2015.07.072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26323946/,81
142230,Patterns of diaphragm function in critically ill patients receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation: a prospective longitudinal study.,2016,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Standard operating procedures (SOP) incorporating plasma levels of rivaroxaban might be helpful in selecting patients with acute ischemic stroke taking rivaroxaban suitable for IVthrombolysis (IVT) or endovascular treatment (EVT). METHODS This was a single-center explorative analysis using data from the Novel-Oral-Anticoagulants-in-Stroke-Patients-registry (clinicaltrials.gov:NCT02353585) including acute stroke patients taking rivaroxaban (September 2012 to November 2016). The SOP included recommendation, consideration, and avoidance of IVT if rivaroxaban plasma levels were <20 ng/mL, 20‒100 ng/mL, and >100 ng/mL, respectively, measured with a calibrated anti-factor Xa assay. Patients with intracranial artery occlusion were recommended IVT+EVT or EVT alone if plasma levels were ≤100 ng/mL or >100 ng/mL, respectively. We evaluated the frequency of IVT/EVT, door-to-needle-time (DNT), and symptomatic intracranial or major extracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS Among 114 acute stroke patients taking rivaroxaban, 68 were otherwise eligible for IVT/EVT of whom 63 had plasma levels measured (median age 81 years, median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 6). Median rivaroxaban plasma level was 96 ng/mL (inter quartile range [IQR] 18‒259 ng/mL) and time since last intake 11 hours (IQR 4.5‒18.5 hours). Twenty-two patients (35%) received IVT/EVT (IVT n=15, IVT+EVT n=3, EVT n=4) based on SOP. Median DNT was 37 (IQR 30‒60) minutes. None of the 31 patients with plasma levels >100 ng/mL received IVT. Among 14 patients with plasma levels ≤100 ng/mL, the main reason to withhold IVT was minor stroke (n=10). No symptomatic intracranial or major extracranial bleeding occurred after treatment. CONCLUSIONS Determination of rivaroxaban plasma levels enabled IVT or EVT in one-third of patients taking rivaroxaban who would otherwise be ineligible for acute treatment. The absence of major bleeding in our pilot series justifies future studies of this approach.","Seiffge, David J; Traenka, Christopher; Polymeris, Alexandros A; Thilemann, Sebastian; Wagner, Benjamin; Hert, Lisa; Müller, Mandy D; Gensicke, Henrik; Peters, Nils; Nickel, Christian H; Stippich, Christoph; Sutter, Raoul; Marsch, Stephan; Fisch, Urs; Guzman, Raphael; De Marchis, Gian Marco; Lyrer, Philippe A; Bonati, Leo H; Tsakiris, Dimitrios A; Engelter, Stefan T",Journal of stroke,https://doi.org/10.5853/jos.2017.00395; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28877563/,81

A number of studies, especially those evaluating NCLF technology, have demonstrated the potential of ultrasound debridement to effectively remove devitalized tissue, control bioburden, alleviate pain, and expedite healing. However, most of the studies are underpowered, involve heterogeneous ulcer types, and demonstrate significant methodological limitations making comparison between studies difficult; there is a paucity of data on cost-effectiveness.

Screening must target those infections with consequences and furthermore, must be cost-beneficial. The introduction of any screening test for infections should take into consideration the prevalence of the condition, its consequences (health impact), the accuracy of the test and whether there are remedial steps including primary and secondary prevention to take with a positive or negative test. For some of these infections (for example syphilis and rubella) universal screening of all pregnant women has been the norm world-wide but as the epidemiology of these infections continue to change, a review of this practice must evolve. Furthermore, emerging infections line severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 pose greater public health challenges. This article provides an overview of screening for infections in pregnancy, critically appraising screening for the common infections and arguing for abandoning of universal screening for rubella but advocating for universal screening for GBS and selective screening for CMV and toxoplasmosis.","Ahmed, Badredeen; Konje, Justin C","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2021.06.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34171635/,81

Whereas the original scale focused on the tendency to have attitudes, the two new scales focus on the tendencies to learn and express attitudes. Although the new scales are correlated with the original scale and each other, each new scale is shown to be related in a unique way to other relevant scales, and most importantly, to predict different outcomes. Study 1 develops the new learning and expressing aspects of evaluation. Study 2 establishes the factor structure of these new dimensions and distinguishes them from the having aspect identified in the original NE scale. Study 3 demonstrates the convergent and discriminant validity of the two new NE scales in relation to relevant existing individual differences. Study 4 shows that the new NE-learning and expressing scales can predict people's preference for different roles in an impending group discussion. Study 5 shows that the NE-expressing scale predicts attitudes in a paradigm where people generate persuasive arguments and Study 6 shows that the NE-learning scale predicts attitudes in response to an external message using evaluative language. Finally, Study 7 shows that the original NE scale predicts above and beyond the two new scales in accounting for people's tendencies to have and possess attitudes toward various social and political issues.

In adult asthma, exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOC) are associated with inflammatory activity. We therefore hypothesised that acute preschool wheeze is accompanied by a differential profile of exhaled VOC, which is maintained after resolution of symptoms in those children with rhinovirus-induced wheeze. We included 178 children (mean±sd age 22±9 months) from the EUROPA cohort comparing asymptomatic and wheezing children during respiratory symptoms and after recovery. Naso- and oropharyngeal swabs were tested for rhinovirus by quantitative PCR. Breath was collected via a spacer and analysed using an electronic nose. Between-group discrimination was assessed by constructing a 1000-fold cross-validated receiver operating characteristic curve. Analyses were stratified by rhinovirus presence/absence. Wheezing children demonstrated a different VOC profile when compared with asymptomatic children (p<0.001), regardless of the presence (area under the curve (AUC) 0.77, 95% CI 0.07) or absence (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.05) of rhinovirus. After symptomatic recovery, discriminative accuracy was maintained in children with rhinovirus-induced wheeze (AUC 0.84, 95% CI 0.06), whereas it dropped significantly in infants with non-rhinovirus-induced wheeze (AUC 0.67, 95% CI 0.06). Exhaled molecular profiles differ between preschool children with and without acute respiratory wheeze. This appears to be sustained in children with rhinovirus-induced wheeze after resolution of symptoms. Therefore, exhaled VOC may qualify as candidate biomarkers for early signs of asthma.","van der Schee, Marc P; Hashimoto, Simone; Schuurman, Annemarie C; van Driel, Janine S Repelaer; Adriaens, Nora; van Amelsfoort, Romy M; Snoeren, Tessa; Regenboog, Martine; Sprikkelman, Aline B; Haarman, Eric G; van Aalderen, Wim M C; Sterk, Peter J",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00044414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25323245/,81

Since the transmission route and transmission capacity of COVID-19 are similar to that of influenza A (H1N1) in 2009, which conforms to the basic elements of ""human pandemic"", and the epidemic scale has exceeded that of influenza A (H1N1)， it is probable to incorporate COVID-19 epidemic response into PIPF, and at the same time to verify and improve PIPF in practice. It is recommended that WHO, other international organizations and relevant countries make full use of the PIPF system to respond to the epidemic and better coordinate national actions at the global level.

The primary outcome variable was upper airway volume dimension change, and the predictor variable was the magnitude of mandibular setback as measured by six different methods. Thirty-one patients were included in the study, with a mean mandibular setback ranging from 1.41 mm to 6.11 mm. None of the predictor variables showed an association with oropharyngeal (P = 0.54) or hypopharyngeal (P = 0.33) volume. Stepwise regression analysis failed to show any significant relationships. Similarly, there was no statistically significant association between any of the predictor variables and oropharyngeal (P = 0.44) or hypopharyngeal (P = 0.74) minimum axial area. The results showed that no correlation exists between the magnitude of mandibular setback and the amount of static airway dimensional changes; therefore, it may not be possible to predict whether obstructive sleep apnea will develop following mild to moderate mandibular setback based upon CBCT measurements.","Han, M D; Antonini, F; Borba, A M; Miloro, M",International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijom.2021.07.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407912/,81

We quantified the impact of different STEMI treatment strategies on patient outcomes and provider risk in context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Using a decision-analytic framework, we evaluated the effect of PPCI versus the pharmaco-invasive strategy for managing STEMI on 30-day patient mortality and individual provider infection risk based on presence of cardiogenic shock, suspected coronary territory, and presence of known or presumptive COVID-19 infection. RESULTS For patients with low suspicion for COVID-19, PPCI had mortality benefit over the pharmaco-invasive strategy, and the risk of cardiac catheterization laboratory provider infection remained very low (<0.25%) across all subgroups. For patients with presumptive COVID-19 with cardiogenic shock, PPCI offered substantial mortality benefit to patients relative to the pharmaco-invasive strategy (7.9% absolute decrease in 30-day mortality), but also greater risk of provider infection (2.3% absolute increase in risk of provider infection). For patients with presumptive COVID-19 with nonanterior STEMI without cardiogenic shock, PPCI offered a 0.4% absolute mortality benefit over the pharmaco-invasive strategy with a 0.2% greater absolute risk of provider infection, and the tradeoff between patient and provider risk with PPCI became more apparent in sensitivity analysis with more severe COVID-19 infections. CONCLUSIONS Usual care with PPCI remains the appropriate treatment strategy in the majority of cases presenting with STEMI in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, utilization of a pharmaco-invasive strategy in selected patients with STEMI with presumptive COVID-19 and low likelihood of mortality from STEMI and use of preventive strategies such as preprocedural intubation in high risk patients when PPCI is the preferred strategy may be reasonable to reduce provider risk of COVID-19 infection.","Butala, Neel M; Patel, Nilay K; Chhatwal, Jagpreet; Vahdat, Vahab; Pomerantsev, Eugene V; Albaghdadi, Mazen; Sakhuja, Rahul; Rosenzweig, Anthony; Elmariah, Sammy",Circulation.

RESULTS Two patients in the SILAR group and 1 patient in the CLAR group experienced anastomotic leakage. The operative time was longer in the SILAR group than in the CLAR group (251 ± 50 vs 237 ± 49 minutes; P = .253). The number of harvested lymph nodes (19.6 ± 10.7 vs 20.8 ± 7.7; P = .630) was not different. The postoperative hospital stay was shorter in the SILAR group (7.1 ± 3.4 days) than in the CLAR group (8.1 ± 3.5 days) (P = .234).

The wine experience scale combines experience traits with the traditional approach to scales related to wine tourism. The development of the scale follows the most recognised validated procedures. Data were collected from a total of 647 international wine tourists in the wine cellars of the two main fortified wine tourism regions visiting areas: Porto and Madeira. Structural equation modelling (SEM-AMOS) was used as the main analysis and validation tool. The resulting 18-item wine experience scale comprises four major dimensions: (1) Wine storytelling, (2) wine tasting excitement, (3) wine involvement, and (4) winescape. All these showed reliable and validated indicators. This new scale presents a valid new tool to better measure and evaluate experiences in a wine tourism setting. This study offers a broad range of use for academics, managers, planners, and practitioners. It shows how a new measurement tool focused on the wine tourism experience in terms of several outcomes and applications, addressing important practical managerial implications, can have an impact on academic research. Most previous tourism scales still fail to measure the specifics of wine settings. This is the first scale that comprises the dimensions of experience with wine senses, applied in a relevant wine destination where research is still limited. The results are relevant in boosting the increasingly recognized awareness of Portugal as wine tourism, as well as bringing experience scales to the body of knowledge.","Santos, Vasco Ramos Paulo Almeida Nuno Santos-Pavón Enrique",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su12198055,81

This has increased awareness of the importance of analyzing learning data left by students to improve and evaluate the learning process. This article presents a new tool, named TaBAT, created to work with different LMSs in the form of dashboards accessible online and allowing teachers to monitor the progress of their learners and at the same time allow learners to visualize their learning process. Background TaBAT is designed based on the results of our previous research on factors that can influence the success of online learners, where we proposed and statistically validated a model for assessing the success of online learners called e-LSAM (e-Learner Success Assessment Model). Methodology Two studies are presented in this article. The first one is conducted on a group of students from two classes (each composed of two groups) of a higher institute in Morocco, who participated in courses organized in blended learning on the Moodle platform. For each class, one of the two groups had access to the experiment to use the TaBAT tool (exposed group) to analyze the learning traces, while the second group did not have access to the dashboard (control group). The second study aimed to understand the impact of the usage of the TaBAT tool on the two exposed groups. Contribution The purpose of this article is to present a new analysis tool as well as to test this tool and to evaluate its impact on self-regulation and the prediction of academic success and, finally, to see how these students evaluate this tool. Findings The results of the TaBAT usage demonstrate the effectiveness of the success algorithm, based on our theoretical model e-LSAM. The results also prove that this tool was able to increase the performance of the students of both groups exposed. The general evaluations of the participants also confirmed these results. Impact on Society The article proposes a tool for institutions to facilitate the monitoring and control of students' learning process. The tool provides visual information for teachers to study and react to in the educational context and gives students visualizations to promote their self-reflection and increase their performance and academic success. Future Research Generalize the use of the TaBAT tool, incorporating both private and public institutions, in order to confirm the results obtained in this article and at the same time improve the self-regulation and academic success of learners.","Safsouf, Y.; Mansouri, K.; Poirier, F.",Journal of Information Technology Education-Research,https://doi.org/10.28945/4820,81

Currently, no antiviral drugs are available to treat CoV infections; thus, potential drug targets need to be identified and characterized. Here, we identify HCoV-NL63 replicase gene products and characterize two viral papain-like proteases (PLPs), PLP1 and PLP2, which process the viral replicase polyprotein. We generated polyclonal antisera directed against two of the predicted replicase nonstructural proteins (nsp3 and nsp4) and detected replicase proteins from HCoV-NL63-infected LLC-MK2 cells by immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot assays. We found that HCoV-NL63 replicase products can be detected at 24 h postinfection and that these proteins accumulate in perinuclear sites, consistent with membrane-associated replication complexes. To determine which viral proteases are responsible for processing these products, we generated constructs representing the amino-terminal end of the HCoV-NL63 replicase gene and established protease cis-cleavage assays. We found that PLP1 processes cleavage site 1 to release nsp1, whereas PLP2 is responsible for processing both cleavage sites 2 and 3 to release nsp2 and nsp3. We expressed and purified PLP2 and used a peptide-based assay to identify the cleavage sites recognized by this enzyme. Furthermore, by using K48-linked hexa-ubiquitin substrate and ubiquitin-vinylsulfone inhibitor specific for deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), we confirmed that, like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV PLpro, HCoV-NL63 PLP2 has DUB activity. The identification of the replicase products and characterization of HCoV-NL63 PLP DUB activity will facilitate comparative studies of CoV proteases and aid in the development of novel antiviral reagents directed against human pathogens such as HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV.","Chen, Zhongbin; Wang, Yanhua; Ratia, Kiira; Mesecar, Andrew D; Wilkinson, Keith D; Baker, Susan C",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17392370/,81

AGE-modified 132m has also been shown to enhance chemotaxis and increase tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta secretion by circulating and tissue monocytes/macrophages. OBJECTIVES To investigate the effect of AGE-modified 132m and AGE-human serum albumin on TNF-alpha and IL-1beta secretion by human peritoneal macrophages derived from patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. METHODS Human PMO were isolated from peritoneal dialysis effluent of stable CAPD patients and were incubated for 24 hours with AGE-modified beta2m, beta2m, AGE-HSA, HSA or lipopolysaccharide. TNF-alpha or IL-1beta secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in cell-free culture supernatants. RESULTS Both AGE-modified beta2m and AGE-HSA significantly increased TNF-alpha and IL-1beta secretion by human PMO in a dose-dependent manner (50-200 microg/ml). In contrast, beta2m or HSA had no such stimulatory effect on TNF-alpha secretion but had a small significant increase in IL-1beta secretion. CONCLUSIONS AGE-modified beta2m promotes in vitro TNF-alpha and IL-13 secretion by human PMO of CAPD patients. Activation of these macrophages by AGE-modified beta2m may be a contributory factor to the morphologic changes and altered permeability of the peritoneal membrane in long-term CAPD.","Rashid, Gloria; Korzets, Ze'ev; Bernheim, Jacques",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16450750/,81

Aotearoa has recently made some notable changes in health policy by formally recognising the physical health needs of people with mental health and addiction issues. The COVID-19 vaccination sequencing framework provides an important opportunity to protect and promote the health of people with addiction and mental health issues. An expert advisory group, convened as part of the Aotearoa Equally Well collaborative, considered findings of a literature review on the vulnerability of people with mental health and addiction issues of contracting and dying from COVID-19. Evidence indicates an association between mental health and addiction issues and infection risk and worse outcomes. The group concluded mental health and addiction issues should be recognised as underlying health conditions that increase COVID-19 vulnerability, and that people with these issues should be prioritised for vaccination. For too long the health system has failed to address the life expectancy gap of people with addiction and mental health issues. Now is an opportunity to change the kōrero. People with mental health and addiction issues experience significant physical health inequities. Addressing these inequities must be integral in modern health policy-including our COVID-19 pandemic response.","Lockett, Helen; Koning, Ashley; Lacey, Cameron; Every-Palmer, Susanna; Scott, Kate M; Cunningham, Ruth; Dowell, Tony; Smith, Linda; Masters, Alison; Culver, Arran; Chambers, Stephen",The New Zealand medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34239152/,81

After an initial brief period of pyrexia in three calves and transient mild diarrhea in five calves, calves were clinically normal throughout the 13- to 27-day study. The population of E. coli O157:H7 in the faces decreased dramatically in all calves during the first 2 weeks after inoculation. Thereafter, small populations of E. coli O157:H7 persisted in all calves, where they were detected intermittently in the feces and rumen contents. While withholding food increased fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 by 1 to 2 log10/g in three of four calves previously shedding small populations of E. coli O157:H7, the effect of fasting on fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 was variable in calves shedding larger populations. At necropsy, E. coli O157:H7 was not isolated from sites outside the alimentary tract. E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from the forestomach or colon of all calves at necropsy. Greater numbers of E. coli O157:H7 were present in the gastrointestinal contents than in the corresponding mucosal sections, and there was no histologic or immunohistochemical evidence of E. coli O157:H7 adhering to the mucosa. In conclusion, under these experimental conditions, E. coli O157:H7 is not pathogenic in weaned calves, and while it does not appear to colonize mucosal surfaces for extended periods, E. coli O157:H7 persists in the contents of the rumen and colon as a source for fecal shedding.","Brown, C A; Harmon, B G; Zhao, T; Doyle, M P",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8979335/,81
197809,A pilot study of cerebral and haemodynamic physiological changes during sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol in patients with acute brain injury.,2012,"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to assess the high-resolution CT (HRCT) findings at presentation and after hospital admission in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed the HRCT findings at presentation (n = 12) and after hospital admission (n = 25) of 29 patients with SARS and compared the HRCT findings with the radiographic findings. HRCT scans were obtained using 1-mm (n = 28) or 2-mm (n = 1) collimation. The radiographs and HRCT scans were reviewed independently by two observers who reached a decision by consensus. RESULTS All patients had abnormal findings on HRCT at presentation. Eight of these 12 patients had normal findings on radiographs. The predominant HRCT findings at presentation consisted of unilateral (n = 6) or bilateral (n = 2) ground-glass opacities or focal unilateral (n = 2) or bilateral (n = 2) areas of consolidation. All patients showed progression of disease on follow-up. The predominant HRCT findings on follow-up CT scans consisted of unilateral (n = 2) or bilateral ground-glass opacities (n = 13), unilateral (n = 2) or bilateral consolidation (n = 5), or a mixed bilateral pattern of ground-glass attenuation, consolidation, and reticulation (n = 3). Reticulation with associated architectural distortion and mild traction bronchiectasis was present in eight patients. CONCLUSION HRCT can show parenchymal abnormalities in patients with SARS who have normal findings on radiographs at presentation. Follow-up CT scans obtained in hospitalized patients show findings consistent with fibrosis in a small percentage of patients.","Müller, Nestor L; Ooi, Gaik C; Khong, Pek Lan; Zhou, Lin J; Tsang, Kenneth W T; Nicolaou, Savvas",AJR.

High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is well accepted as a conventional therapy for KD. The aim of the present study was to determine the expression level of Toll like receptors (TLRs) and their corresponding signaling mediators in PBMCs of IVIG-treated KD patients. TLR2, 3, 9 and signaling mediators, MyD88 and TRIF transcript levels were determined in PBMCs from 31 KD patients, before (acute phase), 2 weeks later (sub-acute phase) and 6 weeks later (convalescent phase) of IVIG therapy using real time PCR. The mean age of the patients was 3.6 years and 65% of subjects were male and 35% were female. 20 age-matched irrelevant febrile patients and 20 healthy subjects were included as control groups. Elevated levels of TLR2, MyD88, and TRIF gene transcripts were observed in the PBMCs at acute phase of untreated KD patients in compression with normal subjects. IVIG therapy resulted in significant decrease in TLR2, 3 and 9 (60-90%) as well as MyD88 and TRIF (60-70%) transcripts following 2 and 6 weeks. With Regard to significant up-regulation of MyD88 and TRIF at the acute phase of KD, our findings suggest TLR signaling pathway potential in KD pathogenesis and may also support the assumption of an infectious background in KD. Down-regulation of TLR members and corresponding mediators in IVIG treated patient suggest general TLR pathway suppression as a novel anti-inflammatory mechanism of IVIG.","Mortazavi, Seyed Hamidreza; Amin, Reza; Alyasin, Soheyla; Kashef, Sara; Karimi, Mohammad Hossein; Babaei, Maryam; Younesi, Vahid","Iranian journal of allergy, asthma, and immunology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25780885/,81

The comparison of the genomic sequence of different strains has generated discrepancies as for if the SARS epidemic arose as an unique outbreak or it was produced for more than one genotype. However, this fact is secondary to the imminent threat that was controlled in August of 2003, after affecting 8.422 individuals, but before which we should be remain alert, since it is clear that the end of the SARS is not yet here; and that the appearance of a single case can mean the beginning of a new wave, joining the outbreak of other diseases such as the avian flu.

Presently, there are a number of point-of-care tests for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening. However, the reliability of these test kits is poorly documented and hence, needs to be ascertained. This study was therefore designed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of two serological test kits for COVID-19 screening with the view to providing necessary information on the suitability of their deployment as routine test kits for SARS-CoV-2 in Nigeria. Forty-seven (47) asymptomatic adults who had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 with the real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) were enrolled into this study. Blood samples were obtained for qualitative determination of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to the S-antigen of SARS-CoV-2 using a commercially available IgM and IgG Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The association between the test kits (ELISA and RDT) and PCR in diagnosing COVID-19 was determined using the Fisher's Exact test at P<0.05. The sensitivity and specificity of the test kits were determined using ROC while the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), Positive Likelihood Ratio (PLR), Negative Likelihood Ratio (NLR), Diagnostic Odds Ratio (DOR) and accuracy were calculated as appropriate. Twenty-eight (59.6%) of the study participants had positive PCR result. ELISA and RDT identified 20 (42.6%) and 13 (27.7%) participants respectively as having anti- SARS COV-2 specific antibodies. ELISA had a better sensitivity performance, NPV, PLR, DOR and accuracy than the RDT while the RDT had a better specificity performance than ELISA. The proportion of participants with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody identified using ELISA was significantly higher compared with RDT. In contrast, the proportion of participants with positive anti- SARS COV-2 IgG antibody identified using RDT was significantly higher compared with ELISA. ELISA has a better sensitivity for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike-protein specific antibodies than the RDT. However, combination of RDT and ELISA for the detection of anti-SARS-COV-2 antibodies might be useful for population COVID-19 screening.","Arinola, Olatunbosun Ganiyu; Edem, Victory Fabian; Rahamon, Sheu Kadiri; Yaqub, Surajudeen Adekunle; Fashina, A O; Alonge, Temitope Oluwagbenga",Nigerian journal of physiological sciences : official publication of the Physiological Society of Nigeria,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34009193/,81
201387,Current trends in utilization of fibrinolytic-based reperfusion strategies and bleeding outcomes in ST-elevation myocardial infarction,2020,"AIM The impact of COVID-19 pandemic is pronounced in each healthcare process, including the management of breast cancer. The anxiety of COVID-19 changes patient preferences and some delay in routine controls and surgical managements occur. Some disintegration in medical care is to be expected during the pandemic, but the new coping strategies are needed in order to avoid delayed diagnosis of breast cancer. METHODS A total number of 140 patients assigned for biopsy and diagnosed with breast cancer in our tertiary clinic between December 1st and August 31st were classified into 3 groups; A (December-February), B (March-May) and C (June-August) in order to compare the stage of breast cancer at the time of diagnosis before, during and after the peak period of pandemic. Clinical stage and age at presentation, family history of breast, ovarian and other types of cancer, BRCA (genetic testing), menopausal status, side of involvement (uni- or bilateral), histopathologic subtype, receptor positivity and molecular subtype were recorded for each patient. RESULTS Group A included 20 stage I (27.77 %), 32 stage II (44.44 %), 16 stage III (22.22 %) and 4 stage IV (5.55 %) breast cancer patients. Group B had 5 stage I (22.72 %), 8 stage II (36.36 %), 7 stage III (31.81 %) and 2 stage IV (9.09 %) breast cancer patients. Whereas in group C there were 4 stage I (8.69 %), 21 stage II (45.65 %), 16 stage III (34.78 %) and 5 stage IV (10.86 %) patients with breast cancer. The number of late-stage cancer patients in group C was significantly higher in comparison with the other groups (p<0.05). CONCLUSION We speculate that the change in incidence of breast cancer by stage is attributable to a delay in the diagnosis of breast cancer due to COVID-19 related restrictions and presentation of new cases at more advanced stages once the restrictions were eased.

202555,Epidemiology and outcomes of invasive mechanical ventilation without ICU admission in acute care hospitals in Texas: A population-based cohort study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, telehealth was an emerging occupational therapy (OT) service delivery model possessing many positive attributes. These include the potential to offset well-documented global occupational therapy practitioner (OTP) shortages. However, wide-spread adoption of telehealth as a delivery model in school-based practice is lacking in the OT evidence literature. While the COVID-19 global health emergency propelled many OTPs into the use of telehealth technologies, in some cases with minimal preparation, an investigation was conducted into the likelihood of telehealth adoption when comprehensive training was provided so that appropriateness of student fit for telehealth could be determined and essential planning could take place. OBJECTIVE: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, a comprehensive training program was developed incorporating detailed perceptions of OTPs experienced in and new to telehealth in school-based practice as measured via surveys with the goal of increasing adoption of telehealth technologies for the delivery of OT services. Following the completion of the online New to Telehealth Pre-training Survey, OTPs new to telehealth were invited to complete the OT Telehealth Primer: School-based Practice training program. Analysis of pre- and post-training surveys yielded information about attitudinal changes experienced post-training. METHODS: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, school-based occupational therapy practitioners (OTP) experienced in telehealth were invited to complete a survey exploring benefits and barriers encountered in the delivery of OT services using telehealth. OTPs new-to-telehealth were invited to complete a different survey intended to explore attitudes about the potential use of telehealth. Data collected from both surveys were used to develop a comprehensive training program, The OT Telehealth Primer for School-based Practice. OTPs new-to-telehealth were invited to complete the training program and a post-training survey. A descriptive data analysis was completed on responses from pre- to post-training surveys and the chi-square test of independence was used to evaluate difference in reported likelihood of adopting telehealth into practice before and after training. RESULTS: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, the top benefits identified by the OTP Experienced Telehealth-User Survey included: 1) service access, 2) collaboration and carry-over with team members, 3) efficiency themes, and4) student engagement and comfort. Top benefits identified by the OTP New to Telehealth Survey identified the same top benefits after participating in the training program. A significant decrease in perceived barriers was noted in scores from pre- to post-training by OTPs new to telehealth. The perceived barriers that did not significantly decrease post-training suggest the need for future education and future protocol development. These included: unreliable internet, lack of hands-on opportunity and e-helpers' (parent, caregiver or support system available to assist the student in person during a telehealth session) decreased comfort with technology. Of the participants who completed the OT Telehealth Primer: School-based Practice, 80% reported being likely to add telehealth as a delivery model for future OT practice. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to the COVID-19 global health emergency, completion of the comprehensive training program OT Telehealth Primer: School-based Practice program yielded improved perceived benefits and an increased likelihood of telehealth adoption into practice by OTPs. However, both OTPs and school administrators require ongoing education for successful widespread adoption to be achieved thus offsetting the global shortage of OTPs and increasing service access. Future research, particularly related to available training and support for the rapid adoption of telehealth technologies during the COVID-19 global health emergency, will yield helpful information about the likelihood of continued use of telehealth in practice.","Abbott-Gaffney, Cynthia; Jacobs, Karen",Work,,81

So far, this strategy has been scarcely explored. The aims of this study were to investigate the stability and bioavailability of RIF after combination of a very fast release matrix of RIF with a sustained delivery system of INH. A series of INH-alginic acid complexes (AA-INH) was obtained and characterized. Independent and sequential release profile of AA-INH at biorrelevant media of pH 1.20 and 6.80 was explored. In addition, AA-INH was combined with a RIF-carboxymethylcellulose very fast release complex (CMC-RIF) obtained previously and subjected to acid dissolution assays to evaluate RIF acid stability and determine RIF and INH dissolution efficiencies. Finally, a pharmacokinetic study in dogs was carried out. The AA-INH was easily obtained in solid-state. Their characterization revealed its ionic nature, with a loading capacity of around 30%. The dissolution efficiencies (15 min) confirmed release segregation in acid media with 7.8 and 65.6% for AA-INH and CMC-RIF, respectively. INH release rate from the AA-INH system was slow in acid media and increased in simulated intestinal media. The complete release of INH was achieved after 2 h in simulated intestinal media in the sequential release experiments. The acid degradation of RIF was significantly reduced (36.7%) when both systems were combined and oral administration to dogs revealed a 42% increase in RIF bioavailability. In conclusion, CMC-RIF and AA-INH may be useful for the formulation of a site-specific solid dosage form to overcome some of the main obstacles in tuberculosis treatment.

Besides being easy to send messages, sharing short messages in group chat is considered effective compared to sending massively to several users. The ease of sending short messages in group chat is often used as the spread of fake news and untrue news or hoaxes, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, the information shared can be easily shared by anyone without seeing a valid source. The dissemination of information related to Covid-19 without a clear source is a dangerous act, because it can lead users into false information and endanger themselves. Fake message detectors have not been widely implemented in instant message applications, for this reason, there is a need for a detector and a machine to analyze activities in group chat and see whether the message is included in content containing fake news or not.

The use of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is considered quite effective in classifying an object, the results can be determined whether it is included in fake news, miss-information news, or true news. The process of processing messages is carried out by the massive text processing method because the characteristics of the text are different for each user so that text processing can be maximized for later classification. As a result, group chat can be analyzed based on active time, user messages, user activity, and messages sent between users.","Umam, K.",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,,81

216913,The impact of COVID-19 on short-term prognosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients receiving primary percutaneous coronary intervention in Wuhan China,2021,"The objective of this study was to understand the impacts of COVID-19 crisis in agriculture and food systems in Nepal and assess the effectiveness of measures to deal with this crisis The study draws policy implications, especially for farming systems resilience and the achievement of SDGs 1 and 2 The findings are based on (i) three panel discussions over six months with policy makers and experts working at grassroots to understand and manage the crisis, (ii) key informants' interviews, and (iii) an extensive literature review Results revealed that the lockdown and transport restrictions have had severe consequences, raising questions on the achievement of SDGs 1 and 2, especially in the already vulnerable regions dependent on food-aid This crisis has also exposed the strengths and limitations of both subsistence and commercial farming systems in terms of resiliency, offering important lessons for policy makers Traditional subsistence farming appears to be somewhat resilient, with a potential to contribute to key pillars of food security, especially access and stability, though with limited contributions to food availability because of low productivity On the other hand, commercial farming - limited to the periphery of market centres, cities, and emerging towns and in the accessible areas - was more impacted due to the lack of resilient supply networks to reach even the local market Lower resiliency of commercial farming was also evident because of its growing dependence on inputs (mainly seeds and fertilizer) on distant markets located in foreign countries The observation of crisis over eight months unleashed by the pandemic clearly revealed that wage labourers, indigenous people, and women from marginalized groups and regions already vulnerable in food security and malnutrition suffered more due to COVID-19 as they lost both external support and the coping mechanisms The findings have implications for policies to improve both subsistence and commercial farming systems – in particular the former by improving the productivity through quality inputs and by diversifying, promoting and protecting the indigenous food system, while the latter through sustainable intensification by building reliant supply network linking farming with markets and guarantying the supply of inputs","Adhikari, Jagannath Timsina Jagadish Khadka Sarba Raj Ghale Yamuna Ojha Hemant",Agricultural Systems,,81

224291,Pragmatic Disease-Focused Checklist for Use During Rounding on Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19,2021,"Background: Recently, a large-scale novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) outbreak swept China. As of Feb. 9, 2020, a total of 40,260 patients have been diagnosed with NCP, and 23,589 patients were suspected to have infected by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which puts forward a great challenge for public health and clinical treatment in China. Until now, we are in the high-incidence season of NCP. Thus, the analysis of the transmissibility change of NCP and its potential factors may provide a reliable reference for establishing effective prevention and control strategies. Method: By means of the method of calculating the instantaneous basic reproduction number R 0t proposed by Cori et al. (2013), we use R 0t to describe the transmissibility change of COVID-19 in China, 2019-2020. In addition, the Baidu Index (BDI) and Baidu Migration Scale (BMS) were selected to measure the public awareness and the effect of Wuhan lockdown (restricted persons in Wuhan outflow from the epidemic area) strategy, respectively. The Granger causality test (GCT) was carried out to explore the association between public awareness, the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy, and the transmissibility of COVID-19. Results: The estimated averaged basic reproduction number of NCP in China was 3.44 with 95% CI (2.87, 4.0) during Dec. 8, 2019, to Feb. 9, 2020. The instantaneous basic reproduction numbers (R 0t ) have two waves and reaching peaks on Jan. 8 and Jan. 27, respectively. After reaching a peak on Jan. 27, R 0t showed a continuous decline trend. On Feb. 9, R 0t has fallen to 1.68 (95% CI: 1.66, 1.7), but it is still larger than 1. We find a significantly negative association between public awareness and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, with one unit increase in cumulative BDI leading to a decrease of 0.0295% (95% CI: 0.0077, 0.051) R 0t . We also find a significantly negative association between the effect of the Wuhan lockdown strategy and the transmissibility change of COVID-19, and a one unit decrease in BMS may lead to a drop of 2.7% (95% CI: 0.382, 4.97) R 0t . Conclusion: The current prevention and control measures have effectively reduced the transmissibility of COVID-19; however, R 0t is still larger than the threshold 1. The results show that the government adopting the Wuhan lockdown strategy plays an important role in restricting the potential infected persons in Wuhan outflow from the epidemic area and avoiding a nationwide spread by quickly controlling the potential infection in Wuhan. Meanwhile, since Jan. 18, 2020, the people successively accessed COVID-19-related information via the Internet, which may help to effectively implement the government's prevention and control strategy and contribute to reducing the transmissibility of NCP. Therefore, ongoing travel restriction and public health awareness remain essential to provide a foundation for controlling the outbreak of COVID-19.","Zhao, Yu; Wang, Ruonan; Li, Jiangping; Zhang, Yuhong; Yang, Huifang; Zhao, Yi",Biomed Res Int,,81

229761,Brain natriuretic peptide to predict successful liberation from mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"Background The hospitalization rates among Heart Failure (HF) patients has increased from 23% in 2000 to 29% in 2010 necessitating the efforts to improve care and reduce cost (CDC, 2014). This is causing an increase burden on the health care system, families, and the society. At discharge, patients are educated on self-care, which is a non-pharmacological approach towards patients managing their own disease state. Self-care is a difficult concept for most Heart Failure patients to master because it requires adapting to new life-style changes. The caring burden increases as patient's advance in the disease state. HF patients rely on informal care givers who are family and friends (Hooker, Schmiege, Trivedi, Amoyal & Beleman, 2019). The sudden transition to the Heart failure patient's caregiver role can be a social, financial, emotional, and physical strain that effects effective role adaptation. It is important to consider mutuality and preparedness when preparing care givers to their new role. Caregiver mutuality and preparedness can have mediating effects on caregiver role strain and burden over time (Schumacher, Stewart, & Archbold, 2007). Methods The purpose of this cross-sectional correlational study was to investigate the relationship between Heart failure patient's caregiver mutuality and preparedness for caregiving to role strain and burden. Two hypotheses were tested in this study: 1) There will be a negative relationship between Heart failure patient's caregiver mutuality and preparedness to caregivers role strain and burden 2) There will be a negative relationship between mutuality and preparedness to caregivers role strain and burden. The Roy Adaptation Model guided this research. The sample consisted of 195 adult Heart failure patient caregivers who participated via Amazon Mechanical Turk (M Turk) a crowd sourcing marketplace for survey participation and data collection. Predictor measures included mutuality and preparedness. Mutuality was measured by the Mutuality Scale and preparedness was measured by the Preparedness for Caregiving Scale. The outcome measure, role strain, was measured by the caregiver's perception of financial, physical, and social strain, and burden was measured with the Zarit burden scale. Results This study demonstrated that there was a statistically significant negative relationship between caregiver mutuality and preparedness to role strain, r (195) =.058, p &lt; .001 and a statistically significant negative relationship between caregiver mutuality and preparedness to burden, r(195) =.071, p &lt; .001. These findings indicate that mutuality and preparedness are important predictors of caregiver role strain and burden. The Heart failure certified nurse is positioned to translate the evidence of caregiver role research to the assessment, planning, and evaluation of interventions that can assist the informal caregiver during the dynamic phases of caregiver role adaptation. Conclusion Assessing the caregiver's preparation for caregiving, in addition to caregiver mutuality, is an important step in individualizing interventions that will have a positive effect on the role transition to caregiver. Furthermore, individual interventions based on the demand of caregiving will assist in the preparation of the caregiver during the transition to the community setting.

236038,Family Meetings in the Intensive Care Unit During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has acted as a catalyst for the development and adoption of a broad range of remote monitoring technologies (RMTs) in health care delivery. It is important to demonstrate how these technologies were implemented during the early stages of this pandemic to identify their application and barriers to adoption, particularly among vulnerable populations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this knowledge synthesis was to present the range of RMTs used in delivering care to patients with COVID-19 and to identify perceived benefits of and barriers to their use. The review placed a special emphasis on health equity considerations. METHODS: A rapid review of published research was conducted using Embase, MEDLINE, and QxMD for records published from the inception of COVID-19 (December 2019) to July 6, 2020. Synthesis involved content analysis of reported benefits of and barriers to the use of RMTs when delivering health care to patients with COVID-19, in addition to health equity considerations. RESULTS: Of 491 records identified, 48 publications that described 35 distinct RMTs were included in this review. RMTs included use of existing technologies (eg, videoconferencing) and development of new ones that have COVID-19-specific applications. Content analysis of perceived benefits generated 34 distinct codes describing advantages of RMTs, mapped to 10 themes overall. Further, 52 distinct codes describing barriers to use of RMTs were mapped to 18 themes. Prominent themes associated with perceived benefits included a lower burden of care (eg, for hospitals, health care practitioners; 28 records), reduced infection risk (n=33), and support for vulnerable populations (n=14). Prominent themes reflecting barriers to use of RMTs included equity-related barriers (eg, affordability of technology for users, poor internet connectivity, poor health literacy; n=16), the need for quality ""best practice"" guidelines for use of RMTs in clinical care (n=12), and the need for additional resources to develop and support new technologies (n=11). Overall, 23 of 48 records commented on equity characteristics that stratify health opportunities and outcomes, including general characteristics that vary over time (eg, age, comorbidities; n=17), place of residence (n=11), and socioeconomic status (n=7). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this rapid review highlight the breadth of RMTs being used to monitor and inform treatment of COVID-19, the potential benefits of using these technologies, and existing barriers to their use. Results can be used to prioritize further efforts in the implementation of RMTs (eg, developing ""best practice"" guidelines for use of RMTs and generating strategies to improve equitable access for marginalized populations).","Houlding, Elizabeth; Mate, Kedar K V; Engler, Kim; Ortiz-Paredes, David; Pomey, Marie-Pascale; Cox, Joseph; Hijal, Tarek; Lebouché, Bertrand",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,81

The prevalence varied from 3.4 to 66 percent and more prevalent in patients who died. This study aimed to investigate the mediastinal lymphadenopathy and the disease progression in COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: In this case-control study, 195 COVID-19 patients were divided into two groups, with the mediastinal lymphadenopathy and without it. In these groups, demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, laboratory results, and outcomes were compared. Results: The median age in the LAP group was higher than the opposite group (62 vs. 58.5;p= 0.037). SpO2 (85% vs. 90%;P <0.001), lymphocyte count (760 vs. 969;p= 0.02), Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (5.53 vs. 4.41;p= 0.02), and ESR (36 vs. 29;p= 0.03) were significantly correlated with the presence of lymphadenopathy, using the Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon rank test. ICU admission (65.71% vs. 36.87;p= 0.003), mechanical ventilation (31.42% vs. 13.75%;p= 0.022), disease severity (65.71% vs. 40%;p <0.01), length of hospital stay (9 vs. 7;p= 0.039) and mortality rate (40% vs. 21.25%;p= 0.034) were more predominantly observed in the LAP group, using the χ2 test. There was no apparent difference in sex and the underlying diseases among the two groups. Conclusion: This observation showed a relatively high prevalence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy in COVID-19 patients, which was more common in the elderly with low oxygen saturation. Therefore, LAP may lead to further intensive care needs, more use of mechanical ventilation, high severity of disease, and mortality rate.

244826,Comparison of renal histopathology and gene expression profiles between severe COVID-19 and bacterial sepsis in critically ill patients,2021,"Background: Lung histopathology demonstrates vasculopathy in a subset of deceased COVID19 patients, which resembles histopathology observed in antibody-mediated lung transplant rejection. Autoantibodies against angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and Endothelin receptor Type A (ETAR) have been demonstrated in antibody-mediated rejection and may also be associated with severe COVID19 infection. Objective To assess AT1R and ETAR auto-antibodies in COVID19 patients and controls, and explore their association with disease course. Methods: 65 hospitalized patients with COVID19 infection were included. Clinical and laboratory findings were retrospectively assessed. Patients with unfavorable disease course, admitted at the intensive care unit and/or deceased during hospital admission (n=33) were compared to admitted COVID19 patients with favorable disease course (n=32). The presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and auto-antibodies against AT1R or ETAR in peripheral blood were compared between COVID19 with unfavorable and favorable disease course and age matched controls (n=20). Results: The presence of ANA was not significantly different between COVID19 patients with unfavorable (n=7/33; 21%) and favorable disease course (n=6/32; 19%) (p= 0.804) and controls (n=3/20; 15%). Auto-antibodies against AT1R were significantly increased in unfavorable disease course (median 14.59 U/mL, IQR 11.28 - 19.89) compared to favorable disease course (median 10.67 U/mL, IQR 8.55 - 13.0, p< 0.01).

246584,Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 on Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Survival Rate: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis,2021,"Short Tandem Repeat (STR-) and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP-) genotyping have been extensively studied within forensic kinship analysis. Nevertheless, no results have been reported on kinship analysis after whole genome amplification (WGA) of single cells. This WGA step is a necessary procedure in several applications, such as cell-based non-invasive prenatal testing (cbNIPT) and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). In cbNIPT, all putative fetal cells must be discriminated from maternal cells after enrichment from whole blood. This study investigates the efficacy and evidential value of STR- and SNP-genotyping methods for the discrimination of 24 single cells after WGA, within three families. Formaldehyde-fixed and unfixed cells are assessed in offspring-parent duos and offspring-mother-father trios. Results demonstrate that both genotyping methods can be used in all tested conditions and scenarios with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, with a similar evidential value for fixed and unfixed cells. Moreover, sequence-based SNP-genotyping results in a higher evidential value than length-based STR-genotyping after WGA, which is not observed using high-quality offspring bulk DNA samples. Finally, it is also demonstrated that the availability of the DNA genotypes of both parents strongly increases the evidential value of the results.","Weymaere, Jana; Vander Plaetsen, Ann-Sophie; Tilleman, Laurentijn; Tytgat, Olivier; Rubben, Kaat; Geeraert, Sofie; Deforce, Dieter; Van Nieuwerburgh, Filip",Sci Rep,,81

The latest studies found that advanced age, immune function defects, inflammatory factor storms and oxidative stress damage all potentially contribute to the high comorbidity of the two. Direct virus invasion, myocardial oxygen supply and demand imbalance and vascular endothelial and coagulation dysfunction may be important mechanisms for cardiovascular injury in COVID-19 patients. In addition, the expression level of ACE2 (the cell membrane receptor of SARS-CoV-2) in various organs and the peripheral blood not only mediates the direct invasion and damage of the organs, but also participates in regulation of the balance of systematic inflammation and oxidative stress, thus affecting the susceptibility and outcomes of the patients. Herein we review the recent research progress in the comorbidity between COVID-19 and CVMD and explore the mechanisms of cardiovascular damage caused by SARS-CoV-2, thus to provide a theoretical basis for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 with underlying CVMD.","Han, T; Yuan, H; Ye, L; Jiang, X; Bai, L; Wang, C",Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,,81

However, there lacks empirical evidence on socioeconomic inequalities in child mental health and associated factors. METHODS: We conducted a population-based online survey in 21,526 children in China, when children were confined at home for nearly two months during the pandemic. We assessed child mental health problems with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Parental education level and provincial gross domestic product (GDP) per capita were treated as proxies for individual- and population-level socioeconomic status (SES), respectively. Lifestyle and family environment factors included sleep disturbances, physical activity, screen time, primary caregiver, parental mental health, and harsh parenting. RESULTS: Of the children, 32.31% demonstrated mental health problems. Parental education from the highest (undergraduate and above) to the lowest (middle school and below) increased the adjusted odds ratio(aOR) for child mental health problems by 42% (aOR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.29-1.57); provincial GDP per capita (RMB) from the highest (>¥100K) to the lowest (&#8804;¥70K) increased aOR by 41% (aOR, 1.41; 95% CI%, 1.28-1.55). Sleep disturbances, physical activity <1 h/day, media exposure &#8805;2 h/day, non-parental care, poor parental mental health, and harsh parenting were independently associated with increased child mental health problems, regardless of SES. LIMITATIONS: The potential sampling bias, subjective measures, and the cross-sectional design are the main limitations. CONCLUSION: The first evidence from China suggests socioeconomic inequality in child mental health during the pandemic. As unhealthy lifestyle and unfavorable family environment are contributory factors, prioritized interventions are needed to reduce socioeconomic inequality in child mental health problems.","Li, Wen; Wang, Zijing; Wang, Guanghai; Ip, Patrick; Sun, Xiaoning; Jiang, Yanrui; Jiang, Fan",J Affect Disord,,81

Effective treatment for COVID-19 is urgently needed. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the antiviral effect of Arbidol vs. Chloroquine in treating COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 62 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed according to the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in China. They were divided into two groups depending on the antiviral drugs that they received. Participants in the Arbidol group (n=42) received 0.2 g Arbidol, tid for 10 days,and those in Chloroquine group (n=20) received 500 mg Chloroquine, bid for 10 days. The coronavirus negative conversion time and the length of hospital stay were analyzed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups. After antiviral treatment, the nasopharyngeal specimen negative conversion time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the length of hospital stay in the Arbidol group were significantly shorter than those in the Chloroquine group (18.50 vs. 25.05 days, P=0.001; 23.52 vs. 28.75 days, P=0.001). Adverse events observed during the antiviral treatment period were comparable between the two groups. Overall, 3 (7.14%) participants in the Arbidol group and 4 (20.0%) in the Chloroquine group experienced adverse events during antiviral treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Arbidol is advantageous over Chloroquine in terms of the SARS-CoV-2 negative conversion and the length of hospital stay in treating COVID-19 patients.","Li, Ming; Yu, Tongya; Zhu, Jinghua; Wang, Yinjia; Yang, Yanxia; Zhao, Kaiwu; Yi, Yongning; He, Juan; Li, Chao; He, Jian",Ann Palliat Med,,81

It is an emerging field, but due to the lack of trained professionals, the number of professionals providing tele-rehabilitation in Kerala is few in number. The outbreak of the pandemic COVID 19 has forced the speech language pathologists (SLPs) to shift from the traditional face to face therapy to tele-rehabilitation which was a new experience for most of the speech language pathologists. The present study aimed to understand the challenges faced by the speech language pathologists to provide tele-rehabilitation services to the clients during the outbreak of pandemic COVID-19 and how they overcome those barriers using a self-rated questionnaire developed. The questionnaire was sent to speech language pathologists through mail and WhatsApp. 105 speech language pathologists responded. Among them, 77 speech language pathologists provided tele-rehabilitation and served clients of all ages and different disorders with language disorder being the most common and dysphagia and apraxia being the least served client population. Tele-rehabilitation was found to be a viable form of service delivery in the field of speech language Pathology. All possibilities of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) were utilized by the SLPs to provide the best services despite the lack of training and non-availability of resources. This survey depicts the need for publishing standard guidelines for providing tele-rehabilitation services and also it emphasizes the need for improved infrastructure and training to professionals to ensure quality services to their clients.","Vrinda, R.; Reni, P.

Many human viral vaccines are live, attenuated forms of viruses that elicit humoral and cellular immunity. Here, we describe a cold-adapted live-attenuated vaccine (SARS-CoV-2/human/Korea/CNUHV03-CA22 °C/2020) developed by gradually adapting the growth of SARS-CoV-2 from 37 °C to 22 °C in Vero cells. This vaccine can be potentially administered to humans as a nasal spray. Its single dose strongly induced neutralising antibodies (titre > 640), cellular immunity, and mucosal IgA antibodies in intranasally immunised K18-hACE2 mice, which are very susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections. The one-dose vaccinated mice were completely protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection and did not show body weight loss, death, or the presence of virus in tissues, such as the nasal turbinates, brain, lungs, and kidneys.

Since that date, Lombardy has been the most affected Italian region by the epidemic, and its healthcare system underwent a severe overload during the outbreak. From a public health point of view, therefore, it is fundamental to provide healthcare services with tools that can reveal possible new health system stress periods with a certain time anticipation, which is the main aim of the present study. Moreover, the sequence of law decrees to face the epidemic and the large amount of news generated in the population feelings of anxiety and suspicion. Considering this whole complex context, it is easily understandable how people ""overcrowded"" social media with messages dealing with the pandemic, and emergency numbers were overwhelmed by the calls. Thus, in order to find potential predictors of possible new health system overloads, we analysed data both from Twitter and emergency services comparing them to the daily infected time series at a regional level. Particularly, we performed a wavelet analysis in the time-frequency plane, to finely discriminate over time the anticipation capability of the considered potential predictors. In addition, a cross-correlation analysis has been performed to find a synthetic indicator of the time delay between the predictor and the infected time series. Our results show that Twitter data are more related to social and political dynamics, while the emergency calls trends can be further evaluated as a powerful tool to potentially forecast new stress periods. Since we analysed aggregated regional data, and taking into account also the huge geographical heterogeneity of the epidemic spread, a future perspective would be to conduct the same analysis on a more local basis.","Rivieccio, Bruno Alessandro; Micheletti, Alessandra; Maffeo, Manuel; Zignani, Matteo; Comunian, Alessandro; Nicolussi, Federica; Salini, Silvia; Manzi, Giancarlo; Auxilia, Francesco; Giudici, Mauro; Naldi, Giovanni; Gaito, Sabrina; Castaldi, Silvana; Biganzoli, Elia",PLoS One,,81

276908,Coronavirus and Homo Sapiens,2020,"The availability of pathogen-specific treatment options for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) increased the need for rapid diagnostic tests. Besides, retrospective studies, improved lab-based detection methods and the intensified search for new viruses since the beginning of the twenty-first century led to the discovery of several novel respiratory viruses. Among them are human bocavirus (HBoV), human coronaviruses (HCoV-HKU1, -NL63), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus type C (RV-C), and human polyomaviruses (KIPyV, WUPyV). Additionally, new viruses like SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), novel strains of influenza virus A and B, and (most recently) SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged. Although clinical presentation may be similar among different viruses, associated symptoms may range from a mild cold to a severe respiratory illness, and thus require a fast and reliable diagnosis. The increasing number of commercially available rapid point-of-care tests (POCTs) for respiratory viruses illustrates both the need for this kind of tests but also the problem, i.e., that the majority of such assays has significant limitations. In this review, we summarize recently published characteristics of POCTs and discuss their implications for the treatment of RTIs. The second key aspect of this work is a description of new and innovative diagnostic techniques, ranging from biosensors to novel portable and current lab-based nucleic acid amplification methods with the potential future use in point-of-care settings. While prototypes for some methods already exist, other ideas are still experimental, but all of them give an outlook of what can be expected as the next generation of POCTs.","Nelson, Philipp P; Rath, Barbara A; Fragkou, Paraskevi C; Antalis, Emmanouil; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Skevaki, Chrysanthi",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,81

The causative agent of this disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, which also includes severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERSr-CoV). Codon usage of viral genes are believed to be subjected to different selection pressures in different host environments. Previous studies on codon usage of influenza A viruses helped identify viral host origins and evolution trends, however, similar studies on coronaviruses are lacking. In this study, we compared the codon usage bias using global correspondence analysis (CA), within-group CA and between-group CA. We found that the bat RaTG13 virus best matched the overall codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 in orf1ab, spike and nucleocapsid genes, while the pangolin P1E virus had a more similar codon usage in membrane gene. The amino acid usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 was generally found similar to bat and human SARSr-CoVs. However, we found greater synonymous codon usage differences between SARS-CoV-2 and its phylogenetic relatives on spike and membrane genes, suggesting these two genes of SARS-CoV-2 are subjected to different evolutionary pressures.","Gu, Haogao; Chu, Daniel K W; Peiris, Malik; Poon, Leo L M",Virus Evol,,81

It is often assumed that citizens have a strong desire to know their Covid-19 status, and will therefore take advantage of testing opportunities. This may not be the case in all contexts, however, especially those where citizens perceive stigma associated with the Covid-19, have low trust in health institutions, and doubt the procedural integrity of the testing process. This article explores willingness to receive a free Covid-19 test via a vignette experiment (conjoint design) embedded in a phone survey conducted in Malawi in May 2020. The experiment varied test provider (public clinic versus international health organization), proximity to illness, and a confidentiality reassurance. We find that Malawians expect higher uptake of testing in their community when the international health organization offered the test rather than a public clinic, an effect we attribute to higher trust in the organization and/or perceptions of greater capacity to ensure procedural integrity. The confidentiality reassurance did not substantially alter beliefs about the privacy of results, but did increase doubts about the willingness of community members to get tested in a public health clinic. Our findings suggest the importance of considering the demand side of testing in addition to well-known challenges of supply.","Ferree, Karen; Harris, Adam; Dulani, Boniface; Kao, Kristen; Lust, Ellen; Metheney, Erica",World Dev,,81

Female BALB/cJ mice were infected with 6,000 PFU of MHV-A59 (group infected, n = 20) or infected and then immediately treated with a single dose of 500 µg/kg ivermectin (group infected + IVM, n = 20) or were not infected and treated with PBS (control group, n = 16). Five days after infection/treatment, the mice were euthanized and the tissues were sampled to assess their general health status and infection levels. Overall, the results demonstrated that viral infection induced typical MHV-caused disease, with the livers showing severe hepatocellular necrosis surrounded by a severe lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltration associated with a high hepatic viral load (52,158 AU), while mice treated with ivermectin showed a better health status with a lower viral load (23,192 AU; p < 0.05), with only a few having histopathological liver damage (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found between the group infected + IVM and control group mice (P = NS). Furthermore, serum transaminase levels (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) were significantly lower in the treated mice than in the infected animals. In conclusion, ivermectin diminished the MHV viral load and disease in the mice, being a useful model for further understanding this therapy against coronavirus diseases.","Arévalo, A P; Pagotto, R; Pórfido, J L; Daghero, H; Segovia, M; Yamasaki, K; Varela, B; Hill, M; Verdes, J M; Duhalde Vega, M; Bollati-Fogolín, M; Crispo, M",Sci Rep,,81

Drug repurposing, as an efficient way for drug development, has received a lot of attention. However, the huge amount of studies makes it challenging to keep up to date with the literature on COVID-19 therapeutic development. This review addresses this challenge by grouping the COVID-19 drug repurposing research into three large groups, including clinical trials, computational research, and in vitro protein-binding experiments. Particularly, to facilitate future drug discovery and the creation of effective drug combinations, drugs are organized by their mechanisms of action and reviewed by their efficacy measured by clinical trials. Providing this subtyping information, we hope this review would serve the scientists, clinicians, and the pharmaceutical industry who are looking at the new therapeutics for COVID-19 treatment.","Wang, Xueqing; Guan, Yuanfang",Med. res. rev,,81

289505,Intravenous immunoglobulin may reverse multisystem inflammation in covid-19 pneumonitis and guillain–barré syndrome,2020,"Surface disinfecting has become a necessity in the global effort to control the COVID-19 pandemic, and the application of disinfectant liquid to completely and uniformly cover target objects is a common goal. Spraying of these materials offers a clearly beneficial solution where the liquid is atomized into droplets that are distributed on the target surface. However, while surfaces in the direct line-of-sight may receive adequate coverage, hidden surfaces on the sides and back of an object may be shielded and receive limited or no coating. Electrostatically charged sprays have received added attention and use because, in concept, a charged droplet may be more likely to not only land on a surface through direct impingement, but also be drawn further toward hidden surfaces due to attractive charge forces. Therefore, electrostatically charged sprayers provide a uniquely beneficial method to distribute disinfectant materials, although the actual effects have received limited scientific analysis. In the present study, a commercially available electrostatic sprayer has been investigated with electrostatic spray charge off and on in order to evaluate the resulting coating completeness, uniformity, and efficiency. Detailed measurements of the spray characteristics, such as drop size, velocity, and concentration, both upstream and downstream of the target object, offer explanations for differences in the resulting coverage. While this investigation is not comprehensive, it serves to offer insight into the potential benefits of electrostatically charged disinfecting sprays as well as explanations into how those improvements are achieved. Using the present sprayer, disinfectant material, and target object, coverage was improved by 40% using charged droplets, primarily due to increased coverage on the downstream (back) side of the target cylinder, which saw zero coverage without charged droplets. Through detailed analysis, this improvement is attributed to alterations in the velocity field of the droplets just downstream of the cylinder where the charged droplets are more susceptible to following the recirculating turbulence of the entrained air flow.","Bade, K.

290732,The effect of diabetes on mortality of COVID-19: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has broader geographic spread and potentially longer lasting effects than previous disasters. Necessary preventive precautions for the transmission of COVID-19 resulted in delays of in-person healthcare services, especially at the outset of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Among a US sample, we examined the rates of delays (defined as cancellations and postponements) to healthcare at the outset of the pandemic and characterized the reasons for delays. METHODS: As part of an internet-based survey distributed on social media in April 2020, we asked a US-based convenience sample of 2,570 participants about delays to their healthcare due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participant demographics and self-reported worries about general health and the COVID-19 pandemic were explored as potent determinants of healthcare delays. Along with all delays, we focused on three main types of delays as the primary outcomes in the study: 1) dental, 2) preventive, and 3) diagnostic care. For each outcome, we used bivariate statistical tests (t-tests and chi-square tests) and multiple logistic regression models to study which factors are associated with healthcare delays. RESULTS: The top reported barrier to receiving healthcare was fear of COVID-19 infection (34%). Almost half (n = 1,227, 48%) of participants reported experiencing healthcare delays. Among those who experienced healthcare delays and further clarified the type of delay they experienced, the top three reported types of care affected included: 1) dental (n = 351, 38%); 2) preventive (n = 269, 29%); and 3) diagnostic (n = 151, 16%) care. Logistic regression models show that age, gender, sexual identity, education, and self-reported worry about general health are significantly associated with experiencing healthcare delays overall. Self-reported worry about general health was negatively related to experiencing delays in dental care, while this predictor was positively associated with delays in diagnostic testing in the logistic regression model. Additionally, age was positively associated with delays in diagnostic testing. No factors remained significant in the multiple logistic regression for delays in preventive care, although race was marginally significant (p=.056), with people of color reporting experiencing less delays than their white counter parts. CONCLUSIONS: Lessons learned from the initial surge of COVID-19 cases can help inform systemic mitigation strategies for potential future disruptions. This research addresses the demand-side of healthcare delays by exploring the determinants of delays. More research on healthcare delays during the pandemic is needed, including the short- and long-term impacts on patient-level outcomes including mortality, morbidity, mental health, quality of life, and experience of pain.","Papautsky, Elizabeth Lerner; Rice, Dylan; Ghoneima, Hana; McKowen, AnnaLaura W; Anderson, Nicholas; Wootton, Angie R; Veldhuis, Cindy",J. med. internet res,,81

We describe telepsychiatry consultations to a rural hospital's labor and delivery unit. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate how consultation-liaison services during peripartum hospitalization could meet this need. METHODS: One-year data from electronic medical records of women who were at risk of postpartum syndromes and offered a telepsychiatry consult was extracted and reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 85 consults were conducted via telepsychiatry primarily for depression, anxiety, and medication management. Bedside psychotherapeutic interventions and education were provided to 63 patients, medications were initiated for 32 patients, and outpatient referrals were made for 47 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that consultation-liaison telehealth can successfully engage at-risk mothers in psychiatric treatment.

METHODS: We calculated the percentage weekly change in visits to SUDT facilities from the week of January 5 through the week of October 11, 2020, relative to the week of January 6 through the week of October 13, 2019. We stratified facilities by county COVID-19 incidence per 10,000 residents in each week and by 2018 fatal drug overdose rate. Finally, we conducted a multivariable linear regression analysis examining percent change in visits per week as a function of county-level COVID-19 tercile, a series of calendar month indicators, and the interaction of county-level COVID-19 tercile and month. We repeated the regression analysis replacing COVID-19 tercile with overdose tercile. RESULTS: Beginning the eleventh week of 2020, the number of visits to SUDT facilities declined substantially, reaching a nadir of 48% of 2019 visits in early July. In contrast to January, there were significantly fewer visits in 2020 compared to 2019 in all subsequent months (p < 0.01 in all months). Multivariable regression results found that facilities in the tercile of counties experiencing the most COVID-19 cases had a significantly greater reduction in the number of SUDT visits in 2020 for the months of June through August than facilities in counties with the fewest COVID-19 rates (p < 0.05). The study found no statistically significant difference in the change in the number of visits by facilities in counties with historically different overdose rates. DISCUSSION: Our findings support the hypothesis that a reduction has occurred in the average weekly number of visits to SUDT facilities. The size of the effect differs based on the number of COVID-19 cases but not on historical overdose rate.","Cantor, Jonathan; Kravitz, David; Sorbero, Mark; Andraka-Christou, Barbara; Whaley, Christopher; Bouskill, Kathryn; Stein, Bradley D",J Subst Abuse Treat,,81

Insights on S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) interaction with ACE2 receptor and drug repurposing has accelerated drug discovery for the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finding small molecule binding sites in the S protein and ACE2 interface is crucial in the search of effective drugs to prevent viral entry. In this study, we employed molecular dynamics simulations in mixed solvents together with virtual screening to identify small molecules that could be potential inhibitors of S protein ACE2 interaction. Observation of organic probe molecule localization during the simulations revealed multiple sites at the S protein surface related to a small molecule, antibody, and ACE2 binding. In addition, a novel conformation of the S protein was discovered that could be stabilized by small molecules to inhibit attachment to ACE2. The most promising binding site on the RBD-ACE2 interface was targeted with virtual screening and top-ranked compounds (DB08248, DB02651, DB03714, and DB14826) are suggested for experimental testing.

Related clinical features are needed. METHODS: We reviewed 69 patients who were hospitalized in Union hospital in Wuhan between 16 January and 29 January 2020. All patients were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the final date of follow-up was 4 February 2020. RESULTS: The median age of 69 enrolled patients was 42.0 years (interquartile range 35.0-62.0), and 32 patients (46%) were men. The most common symptoms were fever (60 [87%]), cough (38 [55%]), and fatigue (29 [42%]). Most patients received antiviral therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients) and antibiotic therapy (66 [98.5%] of 67 patients). As of 4 February 2020, 18 (26.9%) of 67 patients had been discharged, and 5 patients had died, with a mortality rate of 7.5%. According to the lowest SpO2 during admission, cases were divided into the SpO2 &#8805; 90% group (n = 55) and the SpO2 < 90% group (n = 14). All 5 deaths occurred in the SpO2 < 90% group. Compared with SpO2 &#8805; 90% group, patients of the SpO2 < 90% group were older and showed more comorbidities and higher plasma levels of interleukin (IL) 6, IL10, lactate dehydrogenase, and C reactive protein. Arbidol treatment showed tendency to improve the discharging rate and decrease the mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 appears to show frequent fever, dry cough, and increase of inflammatory cytokines, and induced a mortality rate of 7.5%. Older patients or those with underlying comorbidities are at higher risk of death.","Wang, Zhongliang; Yang, Bohan; Li, Qianwen; Wen, Lu; Zhang, Ruiguang",Clin Infect Dis,,81

The repository contains over 430,000 articles as of 20 September 2021 and intends to provide a one-stop shop for COVID-19 evidence. Considering that systematic reviews conduct high-quality searches, this study assesses the comprehensiveness and currency of the repository against the total number of studies in a representative sample of COVID-19 systematic reviews. MethodsOur sample was generated from all the studies included in the systematic reviews of COVID-19 published during April 2021. We estimated the comprehensiveness of COVID-19 L{middle dot}OVE repository by determining how many of the individual studies in the sample were included in the COVID-19 L{middle dot}OVE repository. We estimated the currency as the percentage of studies that were available in the COVID-19 L{middle dot}OVE repository at the time the systematic reviews conducted their own search. ResultsWe identified 83 eligible systematic reviews that included 2132 studies. COVID-19 L{middle dot}OVE had an overall comprehensiveness of 99.67% (2125/2132).

313067,Should the high-flow nasal oxygen therapy be used or avoided in COVID-19?,2020,"Background: Clinical studies on the impact of dexmedetomidine on tourniquet-induced systemic effects have been inconsistent. We investigated the impact of dexmedetomidine on tourniquet-induced systemic effects in total knee arthroplasty. Methods: Eighty patients were randomly assigned to either control (CON) or dexmedetomidine (DEX) group. The DEX group received an intravenous loading dose of 0.5 µg/kg DEX over 10 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 µg/kg/h from 10 minutes before the start of surgery until completion. The CON group received the same calculated volume of normal saline. Pain outcomes and metabolic and coagulative changes after tourniquet application and after tourniquet release were investigated. Results: The frequency of fentanyl administration postoperatively, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) volume at 24 hours postoperatively, total PCA volume consumed in 48 hours postoperatively, and VAS score for pain at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively were significantly lower in the DEX group than in the CON group. Ten minutes after the tourniquet release, the DEX group showed significantly higher pH and lower lactate level than those in the CON group. Antithrombin III activity and body temperature 10 minutes after tourniquet release were significantly lower in the DEX group than in the CON group. Ca2+, K+, HCO3 -, base excess, and PCO2 levels 10 minutes after tourniquet release were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion: We showed that DEX attenuated pain and hemodynamic, metabolic, and coagulative effects induced by the tourniquet. However, these metabolic and coagulative changes were within normal limits. Therefore, DEX could be used as an analgesic adjuvant, but should not be considered for routine use to prevent the systemic effects induced by tourniquet use.","Lee, Cheol; Lee, Cheolhyeong; So, Cheolhwan; Lee, Jiheui; Choi, Insung; Ma, Xiao; Hwang, Jihyo",Biomed Res Int,,81

317891,Convalescent plasma is a clutch at straws in COVID-19 management! A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the effect of blood eosinophil count (BEC) on lung function decline in healthy individuals. OBJECTIVE: Using a well-established health screening database, we assessed the associations between BEC and decline in lung function, measured as the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1). METHODS: Serial BEC and FEV1 data were analyzed using linear mixed models adjusted for gender, height, and smoking status. The association between BEC consistency and FEV1 decline was evaluated in subpopulation analyses. RESULTS: A total of 4634 individuals were enrolled. The mean number of health-screenings was 7.49 over an average of 11.74 years of observation. A higher log2-transformed BEC was significantly associated with greater FEV1 decline that was stronger in non-smokers (P = 8.56x10-8) than in smokers (P = 1.52x10-3). In subpopulation analyses of 2018 individuals with consistent BECs, those with BECs consistently &#8805; 100/µL (P = 4.58x10-6), &#8805; 200/µL (P = 3.53x10-7), and &#8805; 300/µL (P = 1.12x10-3) had a significantly higher, dose-dependent FEV1 decline than those with BECs consistently < 100/µL. A BEC threshold of 100/µL in non-smokers and 200/µL in smokers may predict accelerated FEV1 decline. CONCLUSIONS: BEC is associated with a decline in FEV1, and a consistently high BEC is an independent risk factor for accelerated FEV1 decline. These results suggest the use of the BEC to identify healthy individuals at high risk for developing chronic lung disease, which in turn may enable a tailored preventive strategy.","Lee, So-Hee; Ahn, Kyung-Min; Lee, Suh-Young; Kim, Sun-Sin; Park, Heung-Woo",J.

321775,Sleep Disordered Breathing Among Hospitalized Patients due to COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has infected millions and killed tens of thousands of people. Public health measures put in place by governments are essential to the success of controlling this disease. However, governments may not feel as incentivized to implement these measures when deaths are not rising along with cases. However, it is known that a delay exists between the time of infection and the time of death. This study attempted to find how long that lag is and how the age of people infected may affect that lag. DESIGN AND METHODS: A descriptive and correlational study was carried out to investigate the length of the lag and the relationship between lag and age. RESULTS: The average lag between daily Covid-19 cases and deaths was 8.053 days with a standard deviation of 4.116 days for nineteen regions. After excluding data from three more regions due to unavailable age data, the regression yielded an equation of lag = 14.015 - 0.153 (% cases above 60) with a p-value of 0.066. Because the p-value of 0.066 is lower than the 0.10 significance level, there is evidence that a relationship exists between the lag and the age of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that regions must remain vigilant when Covid-19 cases rapidly increase without similar increases in deaths since there exists a significant lag between the two. Additionally, a younger demographic of cases may lead to an increased lag, further pushing regions into a false sense of security that should be avoided.","Jin, Raymond",,,81

The effect of T2DM medications on COVID-19 outcomes remains unclear. In a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 131 patients with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19 in Wuhan, we have previously found that metformin use prior to hospitalization is associated with reduced mortality. Here we continue to investigate the effects of inpatient use of T2DM medications, including metformin, acarbose, insulin, and sulfonylureas, on the mortality of COVID-19 patients with T2DM during hospitalization. We found that patients using metformin and acarbose, alone or both together, after admission were significantly more likely to survive than those who did not use either metformin or acarbose. Thus, our analyses suggest that inpatient use of metformin and acarbose together or alone during hospitalization should be studied in randomized trials.","Li, W.; Li, J.; Wei, Q.; McCowen, K.; Xiong, W.; Liu, J.; Jiang, W.; Thomas, R.; Hepokoski, M.; He, M.; Shyy, J.; Malhotra, A.; Xiong, N.",,,81

327262,In response to: Laparoscopic surgery and the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: A word from a different hymn sheet,2020,"BACKGROUND: The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus first discovered at the end of 2019. It has led to more than 50 million confirmed cases and more than 1 million deaths across 219 countries as of 11 November 2020, according to WHO statistics. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are similar. They are highly pathogenic and threaten public health, impair the economy, and inflict long-term impacts on society. No drug or vaccine has been approved as a treatment for these viruses. Efforts to develop antiviral measures have been hampered by the insufficient understanding of how the human body responds to viral infections at the cellular and molecular levels. RESULTS: In this study, journal articles and transcriptomic and proteomic data surveying coronavirus infections were collected. Response genes and proteins were then identified by differential analyses comparing gene/protein levels between infected and control samples. Finally, the H2V database was created to contain the human genes and proteins that respond to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infection. CONCLUSIONS: H2V provides molecular information about the human response to infection. It can be a powerful tool to discover cellular pathways and processes relevant for viral pathogenesis to identify potential drug targets. It is expected to accelerate the process of antiviral agent development and to inform preparations for potential future coronavirus-related emergencies.

328789,Comparative efficacy of the front-line anti-HBV drugs in nucleos(t)ide analogue-naive chronic hepatitis B: A protocol for systematic review and network meta-analysis,2020,"One major bottleneck in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is the limited number of critical care beds. Due to the dynamic development of infections and the time lag between when patients are infected and when a proportion of them enters an intensive care unit (ICU), the need for future intensive care can easily be underestimated. To infer future ICU load from reported infections, we suggest a simple statistical model that (1) accounts for time lags and (2) allows for making predictions depending on different future growth of infections. We have evaluated our model for three heavily affected regions in Europe, namely Berlin (Germany), Lombardy (Italy), and Madrid (Spain). Before extensive containment measures made an impact, we first estimate the region-specific model parameters, namely ICU rate, time lag between infection, and ICU admission as well as length of stay in ICU. Whereas for Berlin, an ICU rate of 6%, a time lag of 6 days, and a stay of 12 days in ICU provide the best fit of the data, for Lombardy and Madrid the ICU rate was higher (18% and 15%) and the time lag (0 and 3 days) and the stay in ICU (3 and 8 days) shorter. The region-specific models are then used to predict future ICU load assuming either a continued exponential phase with varying growth rates (0-15%) or linear growth. By keeping the growth rates flexible, this model allows for taking into account the potential effect of diverse containment measures. Thus, the model can help to predict a potential exceedance of ICU capacity depending on future growth. A sensitivity analysis for an extended time period shows that the proposed model is particularly useful for exponential phases of the disease.","Ritter, Matthias; Ott, Derek V M; Paul, Friedemann; Haynes, John-Dylan; Ritter, Kerstin",Sci Rep,,81

332442,Nutrition Therapy in Critically Ill Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19),2020,"Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is widely applied in foodborne pathogen detection and diagnosis. According to the cycles of threshold (Ct) values of qPCR testing, samples are judged as positive or negative. However, samples with Ct values in the gray zone are classified as ""possibly positive"" and required to be tested again. Repetitive qPCR may not eliminate the uncertain results but increase the workload of detection. CRISPR/Cas12a can specifically recognize the nucleic acid of the nM level and then indiscriminately slash the single-strand DNA with multiple turnovers. In this way, the detection signals can be greatly amplified. Here, we propose a CRISPR-based checking method to solve gray zone problems. After qPCR testing, the screening gray zone samples can be successfully checked by the CRISPR/Cas12a method. Furthermore, to conduct CRISPR reaction assay more conveniently and prevent possible aerosol contamination in the operational process, a gray zone checking cassette is designed. African swine fever virus (ASFV) is selected as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of the CRISPR-based checking method. Of 28 real swine blood samples, 6 ASFV qPCR gray zone samples are successfully checked. The CRISPR-based checking method provides a novel solution to eliminate gray zone sample problems with no additional effects on the PCR, which is operable and applicable in practical detection. The entire process can be completed within 10-15 min. This method will be a good supplementary and assistance for qPCR-based detection, especially in the diagnosis of diseases such as COVID-19.","Chen, Yanju; Wu, Shuyue; Wu, Hui; Cheng, Peng; Wang, Xiaofu; Qian, Siwenjie; Zhang, Mengyao; Xu, Junfeng; Ji, Feng; Wu, Jian",ACS Sens,,81

Their caregivers often struggle with the lack of immediate care available when the patient suffers difficulties at home. Telemedicine is an opportunity to bridge the gap between home and healthcare professionals by allowing the healthcare team to reach into patients’ homes to provide more frequent support. The evidence for the use of telemedicine in patients with chronic respiratory failure remains equivocal. Although the uptake of telemedicine has been slow, the SARSCoV-2 pandemic has resulted in the rapid dissemination of telemedicine to allow the delivery of care to vulnerable patients while reducing the need for their attendance in hospital. Logistical and legal challenges to the delivery of telemedicine remain, but the pandemic may serve as a driver to ameliorate these challenges and facilitate wider use of this technology to improve the experience of patients with chronic respiratory failure.","Shah, N.

The recommendation for using remdesivir in COVID-19 was based on the in vitro and in vivo activity of this drug against SARS-CoV-2. Methodsthis was a prospective, observational study conducted on a large population of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the impact of remdesivir-containing therapy on 30-day mortality; secondary endpoint was the impact of remdesivir-containing therapy on the need of high flow oxygen therapy (HFNC) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or mechanical ventilation. Data were analyzed after propensity score matching. Results407 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were consecutively enrolled. Out of these, 294 (72.2%) and 113 (27.8%) were respectively treated or not with remdesivir. Overall, 61 (14.9%) patients were treated during hospitalization with non-invasive or mechanical ventilation, while a 30-day mortality was observed in 21 (5.2%) patients with a global in-hospital mortality of 11%. Cox regression analysis, after propensity score matching, showed that therapies, including remdesivir-containing therapy, were not statistically associated with 30-day survival or mortality, while need of HFNC/NIV (HR 17.921, CI95% 0.954-336.73, p=0.044) and mechanical ventilation (HR 3.9, CI95% 5.36-16.2, p=0.003) resulted independently associated with 30-day mortality. Finally, therapies including or not remdesivir were not independently associated with a lower or higher risk of HFNC/NIV or mechanical ventilation. Conclusionsthis real-life experience about the remdesivir use in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was not associated with significant increase in rates of survival or reduced use of HFNC/NIV or mechanical ventilation, compared to patients treated with other therapies not including remdesivir.","Russo, Alessandro; Binetti, Erica; Borrazzo, Cristian; Cacciola, Elio Gentilini; Battistini, Luigi; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo; Mastroianni, Claudio M; d039, Gabriella; Ettorre,",,,81

To date whey protein derived mouthdrying has not been quantified using a 'physical measure' in parallel with rated perception. Saliva flow could also relate to whey protein derived mouthdrying, however this has not been previously tested as an intervention. Accordingly, volunteers (n = 40) tested mouthdrying in different whey beverages and the sensory profile was evaluated by a trained sensory panel (n = 10). Volunteers also rated mouthdrying combined with collection of saliva samples post beverage consumption to measure retention to the oral cavity. To modulate saliva flow rate, volunteers both chewed on parafilm (to increase saliva flow) and used cotton wool (to remove saliva) before tasting beverages and rating mouthdrying. Both the volunteers and sensory panel rated whey protein beverages (WPB) as significantly more mouthdrying than the control beverage (whey permeate). The significantly higher rating of mouthdrying from the volunteers coincided with significantly higher protein concentration in saliva samples post WPB consumption, supporting mucoadhesion as the mechanism. Modulating saliva flow did not lead to any difference in rated mouthdrying and future work would be beneficial to evaluate further the influence of natural variation in salivary flow rate.","Norton, Victoria; Lignou, Stella; Methven, Lisa",,,81
358325,High-flow nasal cannula for COVID-19 patients: risk of bio-aerosol dispersion,2020,"The current COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic started in December 2019. COVID-19 cases are confirmed by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in biological samples by RT-qPCR. However, limited numbers of SARS-CoV-2 genomes were available when the first RT-qPCR methods were developed in January 2020 for initial in silico specificity evaluation and to verify whether the targeted loci are highly conserved. Now that more whole genome data have become available, we used the bioinformatics tool SCREENED and a total of 4755 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes, downloaded at two different time points, to evaluate the specificity of 12 RT-qPCR tests (consisting of a total of 30 primers and probe sets) used for SARS-CoV-2 detection and the impact of the virus' genetic evolution on four of them. The exclusivity of these methods was also assessed using the human reference genome and 2624 closely related other respiratory viral genomes. The specificity of the assays was generally good and stable over time. An exception is the first method developed by the China Center for Disease Control and prevention (CDC), which exhibits three primer mismatches present in 358 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced mainly in Europe from February 2020 onwards. The best results were obtained for the assay of Chan et al. (2020) targeting the gene coding for the spiking protein (S). This demonstrates that our user-friendly strategy can be used for a first in silico specificity evaluation of future RT-qPCR tests, as well as verifying that the former methods are still capable of detecting circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Gand, Mathieu; Vanneste, Kevin; Thomas, Isabelle; Van Gucht, Steven; Capron, Arnaud; Herman, Philippe; Roosens, Nancy H C; De Keersmaecker, Sigrid C J",,,81

363736,"Impact of COVID-2019 outbreak on prevalence, clinical presentation and outcomes of ST-elevation myocardial infarction",2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly changed delivery of cancer care. Many nonurgent surgeries are delayed to preserve hospital resources, and patient visits to health care settings are limited to reduce exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Providers must carefully weigh risks and benefits of delivering immunosuppressive therapy during the pandemic. For breast cancer, a key difference is increased use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy due to deferral of many breast surgeries during the pandemic. In some cases, this necessitates increased use of genomic tumor profiling on core biopsy specimens to guide neoadjuvant therapy decisions. Breast cancer treatment during the pandemic requires multidisciplinary input and varies according to stage, tumor biology, comorbidities, age, patient preferences, and available hospital resources. We present here the Johns Hopkins Women's Malignancies Program approach to breast cancer management during the COVID-19 pandemic. We include algorithms based on tumor biology and extent of disease that guide management decisions during the pandemic. These algorithms emphasize medical oncology treatment decisions and demonstrate how we have operationalized the general treatment recommendations during the pandemic proposed by national groups, such as the COVID-19 Pandemic Breast Cancer Consortium. Our recommendations can be adapted by other institutions and medical oncology practices in accordance with local conditions and resources. Guidelines such as these will be important as we continue to balance treatment of breast cancer against risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection until approval of a vaccine.","Sheng, Jennifer Y; Santa-Maria, Cesar A; Mangini, Neha; Norman, Haval; Couzi, Rima; Nunes, Raquel; Wilkinson, Mary; Visvanathan, Kala; Connolly, Roisin M; Roussos Torres, Evanthia T; Fetting, John H; Armstrong, Deborah K; Tao, Jessica J; Jacobs, Lisa; Wright, Jean L; Thorner, Elissa D; Hodgdon, Christine; Horn, Samantha; Wolff, Antonio C; Stearns, Vered; Smith, Karen L",JCO Oncol Pract,,81

365582,Impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on ST-elevation myocardial infarction admissions and outcomes in a Portuguese primary percutaneous coronary intervention center: Preliminary Data,2021,"As a result of the worldwide transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into an unprecedented pandemic. Currently, with unavailable pharmaceutical treatments and vaccines, this novel coronavirus results in a great impact on public health, human society, and global economy, which is likely to last for many years. One of the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that a long-term system with non-pharmaceutical interventions for preventing and controlling new infectious diseases is desirable to be implemented. Internet of things (IoT) platform is preferred to be utilized to achieve this goal, due to its ubiquitous sensing ability and seamless connectivity. IoT technology is changing our lives through smart healthcare, smart home, and smart city, which aims to build a more convenient and intelligent community. This paper presents how the IoT could be incorporated into the epidemic prevention and control system. Specifically, we demonstrate a potential fog-cloud combined IoT platform that can be used in the systematic and intelligent COVID-19 prevention and control, which involves five interventions including COVID-19 Symptom Diagnosis, Quarantine Monitoring, Contact Tracing&Social Distancing, COVID-19 Outbreak Forecasting, and SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Tracking. We investigate and review the state-of-the-art literatures of these five interventions to present the capabilities of IoT in countering against the current COVID-19 pandemic or future infectious disease epidemics.","Dong, Yudi; Yao, Yu-Dong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08056v2.pdf,81

368608,"Gastroenterological and hepatic manifestations of patients with COVID-19, prevalence, mortality by country, and intensive care admission rate: systematic review and meta-analysis",2021,"BACKGROUND: Chronological age (CA) is a predictor of adverse COVID-19 outcomes; however, CA alone does not capture individual responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we evaluated the influence of aging metrics PhenoAge and PhenoAgeAccel to predict adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore, we sought to model adaptive metabolic and inflammatory responses to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection using individual PhenoAge components. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed cases admitted to a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City. PhenoAge and PhenoAgeAccel were estimated using laboratory values at admission. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to estimate risk for COVID-19 lethality and adverse outcomes (ICU admission, intubation, or death). To explore reproducible patterns which model adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used k-means clustering using PhenoAge components. RESULTS: We included 1068 subjects of whom 222 presented critical illness and 218 died. PhenoAge was a better predictor of adverse outcomes and lethality compared to CA and SpO2 and its predictive capacity was sustained for all age groups. Patients with responses associated to PhenoAgeAccel>0 had higher risk of death and critical illness compared to those with lower values (log-rank p<0.001). Using unsupervised clustering we identified four adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection: 1) Inflammaging associated with CA, 2) metabolic dysfunction associated with cardio-metabolic comorbidities, 3) unfavorable hematological response, and 4) response associated with favorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Adaptive responses related to accelerated aging metrics are linked to adverse COVID-19 outcomes and have unique and distinguishable features. PhenoAge is a better predictor of adverse outcomes compared to CA.","Márquez-Salinas, Alejandro; Fermín-Martínez, Carlos A; Antonio-Villa, Neftalí Eduardo; Vargas-Vázquez, Arsenio; C Guerra, Enrique; Campos-Muñoz, Alejandro; Zavala-Romero, Lilian; Mehta, Roopa; Bahena-López, Jessica Paola; Ortiz-Brizuela, Edgar; González-Lara, María Fernanda; Roman-Montes, Carla M; Martinez-Guerra, Bernardo A; Ponce de Leon, Alfredo; Sifuentes-Osornio, José; Gutiérrez-Robledo, Luis Miguel; Aguilar-Salinas, Carlos A; Bello-Chavolla, Omar Yaxmehen","J. gerontol.

The purpose of this study was to compare the results of the SOFIA test to the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA test (APTIMA TMA), a high-throughput molecular diagnostic test that uses transcription mediated amplification for detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from upper respiratory specimens. Three hundred and 40-seven symptomatic patients, from an urgent care center in an area with a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, were tested in parallel using nasal swabs on the SOFIA test and nasopharyngeal swabs on the APTIMA TMA test. The SOFIA test demonstrated an 82.0% positive percent agreement (PPA) compared to the APTIMA TMA test for symptomatic patients tested &#8804; 5 days from symptom onset and a 54.5% PPA for symptomatic patients > 5 days from symptom onset. The Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test was used to determine the cycle threshold (Ct) value from any specimens that were discrepant between the SOFIA and APTIMA TMA tests. Using a Ct value of &#8804; 35 as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 culture positivity, we estimate that the SOFIA test detected 87.2% of symptomatic patients tested &#8804; 5 days from symptom onset that were likely to be culture positive.","Beck, Eric T; Paar, Wendy; Fojut, Lara; Serwe, Jordan; Jahnke, Renee R",J. clin. microbiol,,81

370399,Hydrocortisone treatment is associated with a longer duration of MODS in pediatric patients with severe sepsis and immunoparalysis,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic has been propagating since December 2019, inducing a drastic increase in the prevalence of anxious and depressive disorders in the general population. Psychological trauma can partly explain these disorders. However, since psychiatric disorders also have an immuno-inflammatory component, the direct effects of the virus on the host's immune system, with a marked inflammatory response, but also the secondary inflammation to these psychosocial stressors, may cause the apparition or the worsening of psychiatric disorders. We describe here the probable immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to delineate possible screening actions and care that could be planned. METHOD: Data from previous pandemics, and existing data on the psychopathological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, allowed us to review the possible immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, on the gestational environment, with the risk of consecutive neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus on one hand, on the children and adults directly infected being at increased risks of psychiatric disorders on the other hand. RESULTS: As in previous pandemics, the activation of the immune system due to psychological stress and/or to infection during pregnancy, might lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders). Furthermore, in individuals exposed to psychological trauma and/or infected by the virus, the risk of psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, is probably increased. CONCLUSION: In this context, preventive measures and specialized care are necessary. Thus, it is important to propose a close follow-up to the individuals who have been infected by the virus, in order to set up the earliest care possible. Likewise, in pregnant women, screening of mood disorders during the pregnancy or the postpartum period must be facilitated. The follow-up of the babies born during the pandemic must be strengthened to screen and care for possible neurodevelopmental disorders.","Daaboul, J; Tamouza, R; Leboyer, M",Encephale,,81
372033,Cardiac surgery during the times of COVID-19,2020,"Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein is expressed at the apical plasma membrane (PM) of different epithelial cells. The most common mutation responsible for the onset of cystic fibrosis (CF), F508del, inhibits the biosynthesis and transport of the protein at PM, and also presents gating and stability defects of the membrane anion channel upon its rescue by the use of correctors and potentiators. This prompted a multiple drug strategy for F508delCFTR aimed simultaneously at its rescue, functional potentiation and PM stabilization. Since ganglioside GM1 is involved in the functional stabilization of transmembrane proteins, we investigated its role as an adjuvant to increase the effectiveness of CFTR modulators. According to our results, we found that GM1 resides in the same PM microenvironment as CFTR. In CF cells, the expression of the mutated channel is accompanied by a decrease in the PM GM1 content. Interestingly, by the exogenous administration of GM1, it becomes a component of the PM, reducing the destabilizing effect of the potentiator VX-770 on rescued CFTR protein expression/function and improving its stabilization. This evidence could represent a starting point for developing innovative therapeutic strategies based on the co-administration of GM1, correctors and potentiators, with the aim of improving F508del CFTR function.","Mancini, Giulia; Loberto, Nicoletta; Olioso, Debora; Dechecchi, Maria Cristina; Cabrini, Giulio; Mauri, Laura; Bassi, Rosaria; Schiumarini, Domitilla; Chiricozzi, Elena; Lippi, Giuseppe; Pesce, Emanuela; Sonnino, Sandro; Pedemonte, Nicoletta; Tamanini, Anna; Aureli, Massimo",,,81

We first redefine the inter-country and inter-sector propagating process of intermediate goods, coming up with the concept of Strongest Relevance Path Length (SRPL) based on Revised Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (RFWA). Second, enlightened by betweenness centrality, we introduce Weighted Betweenness Centrality of Edge based on RFWA to measure the Value-Added Pivotability of Input-Output Relations, which brings forth pivotability at domestic, international, and global levels. The results show how much a given country can influence the world economic pattern by linking worldwide upstream and downstream industrial sectors, be it at home or abroad.

376726,Management of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with primary angioplasty in Covid 19 lockdown,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Since December 2019, there has been an outbreak of a novel beta-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China. On March the 11th the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic, with over 118,000 cases in more than 110 countries around the world. In response to the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency, clinical trial research assessing the efficacy and safety of experimental vaccines to prevent COVID-19 are emerging at an unprecedented rate. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the preliminary experiences and ongoing clinical trials of the major candidates and challenges of the vaccine strategies in humans. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: After a priori protocol registration with PROSPERO (181483), a systematic research of the published literature was conducted on 24 April 2020 using Medline (via PubMed), Embase (via Ovid), and WHO databases. Moreover, to explore the more recent literature we also searched the preprint server medRxiv. Finally, we scrutinized the Cochrane COVID-19 study register and the COVID-19 section of ClinicalTrials.gov database for identifying relevant ongoing clinical trials. Thereafter we selected the articles according to the PRISMA guidelines. Animal or in-vitro experimental studies were excluded. Moreover editorials, commentaries, abstracts, reviews, book chapters, and articles not in English were not included. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Our search identified 1359 published papers, 478 pre-print articles and 367 ongoing clinical trials. Finally, only ten ongoing clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. Specifically, seven developed vaccines for the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and three clinical trials assessed the protective role of BCG vaccine against COVID-19. The first group included phase I/II trials with different types of molecules (DNA or mRNA vaccine, bacterial plasmid or viral vectors), the latter were phase III/IV trials designed on the basis of a heterologous lymphocyte activation by the BCG vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: This new disease is pushing the scientific community to develop swiftly a safe and effective vaccine. Notwithstanding the limitations of our analysis, given by the absence of available results, we try to provide a comprehensive view of the ongoing clinical trials in humans. Our analysis reveals a worldwide effort of both scientists and enterprises to achieve one of the most challenging goals of our century.","Checcucci, Enrico; Piramide, Federico; Pecoraro, Angela; Amparore, Daniele; Campi, Riccardo; Fiori, Cristian; Elhage, Oussama; Kotecha, Pinky; Vyakarnam, Annapurna; Serni, Sergio; Dasgupta, Prokar; Porpiglia, Francesco",Panminerva med,,81

380042,Impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide is common in critically ill Covid-19 patients at four months post-discharge,2021,"OBJECTIVE: During the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant reduction in the frequency of visits to healthcare institutions. This circumstance influenced the timely diagnosis and subsequential initiation of therapy in almost all specialties. The aim of the present study is to evaluate a hypothetical change in health awareness with regard to outpatient consultations of ENT physicians in Germany. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study used anonymized data from 146 ENT practices in Germany and included 162,724 patients in Q2 2019, 158,077 in Q3 2019, 128,342 in Q2 2020, and 149,153 in Q3 2020. The first outcome was the difference in the number of patients with at least one visit to these practices between the second and third quarters of 2019 and the second and third quarters of 2020. The second outcome was the number of patients with new diagnoses per practice, defined as diagnoses not previously documented in the database for a given patient. RESULTS: The number of patients per practice was significantly lower in Q2 2020 compared to Q2 2019 (879 versus 1108, p<0.001). There were no significant differences when comparing Q3 2020 to Q3 2019 (1022 versus 1083, p=0.261). Diagnoses of otitis media (-43%), acute upper respiratory tract infections (-42%), chronic upper respiratory tract diseases: (-21%), hearing loss (-20%) decreased significantly in Q2 2020 compared to Q2 2019. There was still a significant decrease in patient numbers for acute upper respiratory tract infections (-26%) and otitis media (-25%) in Q3 2020 compared to Q3 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The presented results are attributable to several facts. Avoidance of doctor´s visits by the patients, reduction of allocation of appointments by practices and consistent obeying of distance and hygiene measures in terms of wearing filtering face masks (e.g. FFP2/KN95).","Rohe, Anna M; Kostev, Karel; Sesterhenn, Andreas M",Laryngorhinootologie,,81
380644,Hydroxychloroquine in the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19: the need for an evidence base,2020,"In drinking water treatment, natural organic matter (NOM) is effectively removed from surface water using ion exchange (IEX). A main drawback of using IEX for NOM removal is the production of spent IEX regeneration brine, a polluting waste that is expensive to discharge. In this work, we studied ceramic nanofiltration as a treatment for the spent NOM-rich brine, with the aim to reduce the volume of this waste and to recycle salt. Compared to polymeric nanofiltration, the fouling was limited. When NOM is rejected and concentrated, a clean permeate with the regeneration salt (NaCl) could be produced and reused in the IEX regeneration process. Bench scale studies revealed that NOM could be effectively separated from the NaCl solution by steric effects. However, the separation of NaCl from other salts present in the brine, such as Na2SO4, was not sufficient for reuse purposes. The low sulphate rejection was mainly due to the low zeta potential of the membrane at the high ionic strength of the brine. The permeate of the ceramic nanofiltration should be treated further to obtain a sodium chloride quality that can be recycled as a regenerant solution for ion exchange. Further treatment steps will benefit from the removal of NOM from the brine.","Caltran, I; Rietveld, L C; Shorney-Darby, H L; Heijman, S G J",Water Res,,81

381874,Prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among people influenced by coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak: A meta-analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Social distancing and similar measures in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic have greatly increased loneliness and social isolation among older adults. Understanding the association between loneliness and mortality is therefore critically important. We examined whether combinations of loneliness and social isolation, using a metric named social asymmetry, was associated with increased mortality risk. METHODS: The sample was derived from participants in The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling older adults aged &#8805;50. Survey data were linked to official death registration records. Cox proportional hazards regressions and competing risk survival analyses were used to examine the association between social asymmetry and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. RESULTS: Of four social asymmetry groups, concordant low lonely (low loneliness, low isolation) included 35.5% of participants; 26.4% were concordant high lonely (high loneliness, high isolation); 19.2% were discordant robust (low loneliness, high isolation) and 18.9% discordant susceptible (high loneliness, low isolation). The concordant high lonely (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-1.87) and discordant robust (HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.04-1.81) groups had an increased mortality risk compared to those in the concordant low lonely group. The concordant high lonely group had an increased risk of mortality due to diseases of the circulatory system (sub-distribution hazard ratio = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.03-2.25). CONCLUSION: We found that social asymmetry predicted mortality over a 7-year follow-up period. Our results confirm that a mismatch between subjective loneliness and objective social isolation, as well as the combination of loneliness and social isolation, were associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk.","Ward, Mark; May, Peter; Normand, Charles; Kenny, Rose Anne; Nolan, Anne",Age ageing,,81

SARS-CoV-2 enters the cells with the help of ACE2; therefore, testicular expression of ACE2 was analysed from transcriptome sequencing studies and our unpublished data. Literature suggested that SARS-CoV-1 (2002-2004 SARS) had a significant adverse impact on testicular architecture, suggesting a high possibility of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 as well. Out of two studies on semen samples from COVID-19 affected patients, one reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the semen samples while the other denied it, raising conflict about its presence in the semen samples and the possibility of sexual transmission. Our transcriptome sequencing studies on rat testicular germ cells showed ACE expression in rat testicular germ cells. We also found ACE2 expression in transcriptome sequencing data for human spermatozoa, corroborating its presence in the testicular germ cells. Transcriptome sequencing data from literature search revealed ACE2 expression in the germ, Sertoli and Leydig cells. The presence of ACE2 on almost all testicular cells and the report of a significant impact of previous SARS coronavirus on testes suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is highly likely to affect testicular tissue, semen parameters and male fertility.","Vishvkarma, Rahul; Rajender, Singh",Andrologia,,81

390660,Covid-19-associated Myocarditis Mimicking St Elevation Myocardial Infarction,2020,"Background: Several variants of the SARS-CoV-2 have been documented globally during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The N501Y, 69-70del, K417N, and E484K SARS-CoV-2 mutations have been documented among the most relevant due to their potential pathogenic biological effects. This study aimed to design, validate, and propose a fast real-time RT-qPCR assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 mutations with possible clinical and epidemiological relevance in the Mexican population. Methods: Targeting spike (S) gene mutations of SARS-CoV-2 (N501Y, 69-70del, K417N, and E484K), specific primers, and probes for three specific quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assays were designed, and validated using Sanger sequencing. These assays were applied in clinical samples of 1060 COVID-19 patients from Jalisco Mexico. Results: In silico analyzes showed high specificity of the three assays. Amplicons of samples were confirmed through sequencing. The screening of samples of COVID-19 patients allowed the identification of the E484K mutation in nine individuals and the identification of P.2 Brazilian variant in Mexico. Conclusion: This work provides low-cost RT-qPCR assays for rapid screening and molecular surveillance of mutations with potential clinical impact. This strategy allowed the detection of E484K mutation and P.2 variant for the first time in samples from the Mexican population.","Vega-Magaña, Natali; Sánchez-Sánchez, Rocío; Hernández-Bello, Jorge; Venancio-Landeros, Alberto Antony; Peña-Rodríguez, Marcela; Vega-Zepeda, Rosa Alejandra; Galindo-Ornelas, Byron; Díaz-Sánchez, Mauricio; García-Chagollán, Mariel; Macedo-Ojeda, Gabriela; García-González, Octavio Patricio; Muñoz-Valle, José Francisco",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,81

To describe the idea about the factors influencing the outbreak data, we presented the current situation of the COVID-19 outbreak with graphical trends. Methods: Primary data were collected and analyzed by using a pre-created Google Survey form having a pre-set questionnaire on the social distancing status of different districts. Secondary data on the total and the daily number of laboratory tests, confirmed positive cases, and death cases were extracted from the publicly available sources to make predictions. We estimated the basic reproduction number (R â¦) based on the SIR mathematical model and predicted the probable fate of this pandemic in Bangladesh. Results: Quarantine situations in different regions of Bangladesh were evaluated and presented. We also provided tentative forecasts until 31 May 2020 and found that the predicted curve followed the actual curve approximately. Estimated R â¦-values (6.924) indicated that infection rate would be greater than the recovery rate. Furthermore, by calibrating the parameters of the SIR model to fit the reported data, we assume the ultimate ending of the pandemic in Bangladesh by December 2022. Conclusion: We hope that the results of our analysis could contribute to the elucidation of critical aspects of this outbreak and help the concerned authority toward decision making.","Hassan, Raguib; Dosar, Abu Sayem; Mondol, Joytu Kumar; Khan, Tahmid Hassan; Noman, Abdullah Al; Sayem, Mirajus Salehin; Hasan, Moinul; Juyena, Nasrin Sultana",Front Public Health,,81

Under these circumstances, it is important to explore various possibilities for the treatment of COVID-19 including herbal medicines. Among various herbal medicines, Soshihotang (SSHT, Xiao Chai Hu Tang in Chinese) has been prescribed to treat various viral diseases and is used in combination with other herbal medicines depending on the patient's symptoms. Methods: For conducting the present review, we searched electronic databases focusing on the antiviral effect of SSHT in experimental and clinical study until April 2020. The search keywords included SSHT, constituents of SSHT, and antiviral effect. We also searched for materials related to topic directly from websites and published books. Based on these search results, we summarized the results of the included materials in the form of a narrative review. Results: In a number of recent clinical studies, treatment with SSHT improved the infection status of the respiratory and hepatobiliary systems, and experimental studies demonstrated the antiviral effect of SSHT and its components. Furthermore, SSHT are being used in China—where COVID-19 outbreak first took place—and offer a new option to treat COVID-19. Conclusion: Based on the present evidences, it is believed that SSHT is likely to be a new therapeutic option for COVID-19. Conducting further studies might provide improved understanding regarding the use of SSHT in treating COVID-19.","Kwon, Seungwon; Lee, Wonhaeng; Jin, Chul; Jang, Insoo; Jung, Woo-Sang; Moon, Sang-Kwan; Cho, Ki-Ho",Integr.

The development of antiviral drugs directed against SARS-CoV-2 and effective vaccines is progressing; meanwhile, the best pharmacological objective is related to the management of all the complications caused by this viral infection, mainly controlling the inflammatory and fibrotic state and preventing the infection from moving into the most serious phases. SUBJECT AND METHOD: Describe the scientific rationale related to the use of an antifibrotic therapy with pirfenidone, as monotherapy and/or in combination with anti-inflammatory drugs to manage and control complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Based on the scientific literature and epidemiological results and considering the pathophysiological, biological, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, an antifibrotic drug such as pirfenidone as monotherapy or in combination with anti-inflammatory drugs can be (acting early, at the right doses and at the right time) therapeutically effective to avoid serious complications during viral infection. The same approach can also be effective as postinfection therapy in patients with residual pulmonary fibrotic damage. Management of inflammation and fibrotic status with a combination therapy of pirfenidone and IL-6 or IL-1 inhibitors could represent a pharmacological synergy with added value. CONCLUSION: In this article, we consider the role of antifibrotic therapy with pirfenidone in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection on going or in the stage of postinfection with pulmonary fibrotic consequences. The scientific rationale for its use is also described.","Ferrara, Francesco; Granata, Giovanni; Pelliccia, Chiara; La Porta, Raffaele; Vitiello, Antonio",Eur J Clin Pharmacol,,81

405766,Mental health status and related influencing factors during the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019（COVID-19）/ 公共卫生与预防医学,2020,"SARS-CoV-2, or COVID-19, has a devastating effect on our society, both in terms of quality of life and death rates;hence, there is an urgent need for developing safe and effective therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. The most promising strategy to fight against this deadly virus is to develop an effective vaccine. Internalization of SARS-CoV-2 into the human host cell mainly occurs through the binding of the coronavirus spike protein (a trimeric surface glycoprotein) to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The spike-ACE2 protein-protein interaction is mediated through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Mutations in the spike RBD can significantly alter interactions with the ACE2 host receptor. Due to its important role in virus transmission, the spike RBD is considered to be one of the key molecular targets for vaccine development. In this study, a spike RBD-based subunit vaccine was designed by utilizing a ferritin protein nanocage as a scaffold. Several fusion protein constructs were designed in silico by connecting the spike RBD via a synthetic linker (different sizes) to different ferritin subunits (H-ferritin and L-ferritin). The stability and the dynamics of the engineered nanocage constructs were tested by extensive molecular dynamics simulation (MDS). Based on our MDS analysis, a five amino acid-based short linker (S-Linker) was the most effective for displaying the spike RBD over the surface of ferritin. The behavior of the spike RBD binding regions from the designed chimeric nanocages with the ACE2 receptor was highlighted. These data propose an effective multivalent synthetic nanocage, which might form the basis for new vaccine therapeutics designed against viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.","Kalathiya, U.; Padariya, M.; Fahraeus, R.; Soumyananda, Chakraborti Hupp T.

Objective: To analyze the full clinical course and the duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detectability in children confirmed with COVID-19 in the Republic of Korea, where rigorous public health interventions have been implemented. Design, Setting, and Participants: This case series of children with COVID-19 was conducted in 20 hospitals and 2 nonhospital isolation facilities across the country from February 18, 2020, to March 31, 2020. Children younger than 19 years who had COVID-19 were included. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19, detected via SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab or sputum by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical manifestations during the observation period, including the time and duration of symptom occurrence. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was also analyzed. Results: A total of 91 children with COVID-19 were included (median [range] age, 11 [0-18] years; 53 boys [58%]). Twenty children (22%) were asymptomatic during the entire observation period. Among 71 symptomatic cases, 47 children (66%) had unrecognized symptoms before diagnosis, 18 (25%) developed symptoms after diagnosis, and only 6 (9%) were diagnosed at the time of symptom onset. Twenty-two children (24%) had lower respiratory tract infections. The mean (SD) duration of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in upper respiratory samples was 17.6 (6.7) days. Virus RNA was detected for a mean (SD) of 14.1 (7.7) days in asymptomatic individuals. There was no difference in the duration of virus RNA detection between children with upper respiratory tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections (mean [SD], 18.7 [5.8] days vs 19.9 [5.6] days; P = .54). Fourteen children (15%) were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir and/or hydroxychloroquine. All recovered, without any fatal cases. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series study, inapparent infections in children may have been associated with silent COVID-19 transmission in the community. Heightened surveillance using laboratory screening will allow detection in children with unrecognized SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Han, Mi Seon; Choi, Eun Hwa; Chang, Sung Hee; Jin, Byoung-Lo; Lee, Eun Joo; Kim, Baek Nam; Kim, Min Kyoung; Doo, Kihyun; Seo, Ju-Hee; Kim, Yae-Jean; Kim, Yeo Jin; Park, Ji Young; Suh, Sun Bok; Lee, Hyunju; Cho, Eun Young; Kim, Dong Hyun; Kim, Jong Min; Kim, Hye Young; Park, Su Eun; Lee, Joon Kee; Jo, Dae Sun; Cho, Seung-Man; Choi, Jae Hong; Jo, Kyo Jin; Choe, Young June; Kim, Ki Hwan; Kim, Jong-Hyun",JAMA pediatr.

The model is estimated by a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm based on a data augmentation scheme, in which the latent states are drawn together with the model parameters for each area and time. As an illustration we analyze incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 collected in Italy at regional level for the period from February 24, 2020, to January 17, 2021, corresponding to 48 weeks, where we use number of swabs as an offset.

Porcine small intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC) are the primary target cells of PDCoV infection in vivo. Here, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to quantitatively identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cells. A total of 78 DEPs, including 23 upregulated and 55 downregulated proteins, were identified at 24 h postinfection. The data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD019975. To ensure reliability of the proteomics data, two randomly selected DEPs, the downregulated anaphase-promoting complex subunit 7 (ANAPC7) and upregulated interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1), were verified by real-time PCR and Western blot, and the results of which indicate that the proteomics data were reliable and valid. Bioinformatics analyses, including GO, COG, KEGG, and STRING, further demonstrated that a majority of the DEPs are involved in numerous crucial biological processes and signaling pathways, such as immune system, digestive system, signal transduction, RIG-I-like receptor, mTOR, PI3K-AKT, autophagy, and cell cycle signaling pathways. Altogether, this is the first study on proteomes of PDCoV-infected host cells, which shall provide valuable clues for further investigation of PDCoV pathogenesis.","Zhou, Xinrong; Zhou, Lei; Ge, Xinna; Guo, Xin; Han, Jun; Zhang, Yongning; Yang, Hanchun",J Proteome Res,,81

We examined screening rates for psychological disorders before and during the pandemic. Methods: Undergraduates were surveyed before (n = 3643) or during the pandemic (n = 4970). Logistic regression adjusting for participant demographics was conducted. Results: Frequencies of depression [OR 1.32, 95% CI (1.17, 1.48)], alcohol use disorder [OR 1.70, 95% CI (1.50, 1.93)], bulimia nervosa/binge-eating disorder [OR 1.54, 95% CI (1.28, 1.85)], and comorbidity [OR 1.19, 95% CI (1.04, 1.35)] were greater during (vs. before) the pandemic. Frequencies of posttraumatic stress disorder were lower during the pandemic [OR 0.86, 95% CI (0.75, 0.98)]. The upward trend in alcohol use disorder was stronger among women than men [OR 1.47, 95% CI (1.18, 1.83)]. The upward trend in depression was stronger among Black students than White students [OR 1.72, 95% CI (1.19, 2.49)]. Anxiety disorders, insomnia, anorexia nervosa, and suicidality showed no significant trends. Conclusions: Depression, alcohol use disorder, bulimia nervosa/binge-eating disorder, and comorbidity were higher, whereas posttraumatic stress disorder was lower during the pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to provide guidance to GPs and healthcare staff working in Australia about the diagnosis and treatment of both newly developed and pre-existing PTSD in the COVID-19 context. Case studies are presented; the authors discuss whether pandemic-related PTSD is different to PTSD caused by different types of traumatic exposure, and the associated implications for treatment. DISCUSSION: The role of GPs in the management of PTSD during the COVID-19 pandemic remains central, involving early detection, assessment and referral. Moreover, health professionals are not immune to the mental health effects of the pandemic and are encouraged to maintain their wellbeing and to seek professional treatment if needed.","Cooper, John; Phelps, Andrea J; Ng, Chee H; Forbes, David",Aust J Gen Pract,,81
420927,Early corticosteroids are associated with lower mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19: a cohort study,2021,"Pulmonary fibrosis arises from the repeated epithelial mild injuries and insufficient repair lead to over activation of fibroblasts and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix, which result in a mechanical stretched niche. However, increasing mechanical stress likely exists before the establishment of fibrosis since early micro injuries increase local vascular permeability and prompt cytoskeletal remodeling which alter cellular mechanical forces. It is noteworthy that COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxemia will receive mechanical ventilation as supportive treatment and subsequent pathology studies indicate lung fibrosis pattern. At advanced stages, mechanical stress originates mainly from the stiff matrix since boundaries between stiff and compliant parts of the tissue could generate mechanical stress. Therefore, mechanical stress has a significant role in the whole development process of pulmonary fibrosis. The alveoli are covered by abundant capillaries and function as the main gas exchange unit. Constantly subject to variety of damages, the alveolar epithelium injuries were recently recognized to play a vital role in the onset and development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In this review, we summarize the literature regarding the effects of mechanical stress on the fundamental cells constituting the alveoli in the process of pulmonary fibrosis, particularly on epithelial cells, capillary endothelial cells, fibroblasts, mast cells, macrophages and stem cells. Finally, we briefly review this issue from a more comprehensive perspective: the metabolic and epigenetic regulation.","Yang, Juntang; Pan, Xin; Wang, Lan; Yu, Guoying",Mol Med,,81

Wearing of masks and social distancing can significantly decrease transmission and spread, however, due to circumstances such as medical or dental intervention and personal choice these practices have not been universally adopted. Additional strategies are required to lessen transmission. Nasal rinses and mouthwashes, which directly impact the major sites of reception and transmission of human coronaviruses (HCoV), may provide an additional level of protection against the virus. Common over-the-counter nasal rinses and mouthwashes/gargles were tested for their ability to inactivate high concentrations of HCoV using contact times of 30 s, 1 min, and 2 min. Reductions in titers were measured by using the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50 ) assay. A 1% baby shampoo nasal rinse solution inactivated HCoV greater than 99.9% with a 2-min contact time. Several over-the-counter mouthwash/gargle products including Listerine and Listerine-like products were highly effective at inactivating infectious virus with greater than 99.9% even with a 30-s contact time. In the current manuscript we have demonstrated that several commonly available healthcare products have significant virucidal properties with respect to HCoV.","Meyers, Craig; Robison, Richard; Milici, Janice; Alam, Samina; Quillen, David; Goldenberg, David; Kass, Rena",J. med. virol,,81
435240,Psychological evaluation and support in COVID-19 critically ill patients: a feasibility study,2021,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has strongly influenced consumers’ habits and behaviours, creating a more sustainable and healthier era of consumption. Hence, there is a potential for further expanding the green food sector in China. The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) is one widely used framework to explain consumers’ food choices. Considering consumers’ internal norms, their perceptions of green food attributes, and the shifting consumer behaviour, our study has extended the TPB framework (E-TPB) by adding constructs of moral attitude, health consciousness, and the impact of COVID-19 (IOC). The results of structural equation modelling among 360 functional samples revealed that the E-TPB model has a superior explanatory and predictive power, compared with the original TPB model regarding Chinese consumers’ green food buying intentions in the current and post-pandemic periods. The path analysis demonstrated that attitude, perceived behavioural control, moral attitude, health consciousness, and IOC have significant positive effects on green food purchase intentions. However, the association between subjective norm and purchase intention varies within the TPB and E-TPB models, which showed a non-significant impact in E-TPB. These findings can generate more suitable managerial implications to promote green food consumption in China during the current and post-pandemic periods.","Qi, Xin Ploeger Angelika",Foods,,81

The cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related acute cardiac injury with unknown pathophysiologic mechanism has become increasingly prevalent. However, it is not yet understood how the extent of cardiac injury differs with the intensity of viral infection. In the current study, we aimed to assess the association between elevated cardiac biomarkers and the severity of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed across PubMed and Embase databases from December 1, 2019 to July 10, 2020, to identify studies that reported cardiac biomarkers of troponin (TnI) and creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) in patients with COVID-19. These studies compared non-severe patients with severe patients, or survivors with non-survivors or medical patients with critically ill patients. The data were extracted for TnI, CK-MB, N-terminal-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-BNP), D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Wherever possible, the data were pooled for meta-analysis (Review Manager, RevMan. version 5.3) with standard or weighted mean or median difference and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: A total of 25 studies involving 5,626 patients were included in the present analysis. More severe COVID-19 infection was found to be associated with higher mean values of TnI (-0.54 [-0.72, -0.36]) (ng/mL), CK-MB (-1.55 [-2.23, -0.88]) (ng/mL) and (-4.75 [-13.31, 3.82]) (units/L), NT-BNP (-815.7 [-1073.97, -557.42]) (pg/mL), D-dimer (-1.4 [-2.04, -0.77]) (mcg/mL), and LDH (-176.59 [-224.11, -129.06]) (units/L), as well as CRP (-64.03 [-68.88, -59.19]) (mg/L) and IL-6 (-22.59 [-29.39, -15.79]) (pg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: There is significant association between elevated cardiac biomarkers and the severity of COVID-19, which underlines the increased risk of acute cardiac injury with more severe viral infection. This highlights the need to understand the cardiac history among the COVID-19 patients during initial assessment and for monitoring.","Walker, Cucnhat; Deb, Subrata; Ling, Hua; Wang, Zhe",J Pharm Pharm Sci,,81

Predisposing factors to contracting COVID-19 and to severe outcomes have been described in registries but were not compared between solid tumors and hematological malignancies. METHOD: This retrospective single oncologic center study included adults with solid tumors or hematological malignancies referred to testing by naso-pharyngeal swab for a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from March 10 to May 18, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 212 patients were included in the study. Forty-five (21%) were tested positive with SARS-CoV-2. The univariate analysis with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR as a dependent variable reveals significant odds ratios (ORs) for age-with a mean of 62.5 years-(OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02-1.08), performance status &#8805;2 (OR: 2.38, 95% CI: 1.22-4.70), inpatient status (OR: 2.36, 95%CI: 1.11-4.91), and hematological malignancies (OR: 2.48, 95% CI: 1.23-4.96). In contrast, OR for solid tumors reveals a negative association (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.20-0.81). When integrating severe outcome (ICU admission or COVID-19-related death) as a dependent variable, the univariate logistic regression model shows significant ORs for pre-existing lymphopenia (OR: 4.0, 95% CI: 1.17-15.04), hematological malignancies (OR: 3.73, 95% CI: 1.09-13.80), and a negative association for solid tumors (OR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.07-0.92).

450908,Thoracic Surgery Consultations in COVID-19 Critically Ill Patients: Beyond Conservative Approach,2021,"PURPOSE: The majority of pregnancies affected by maternal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) do not result in fetal transmission. However, several studies have identified parenchymal changes in their placental tissues, suggesting a placental response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the maternal-fetal interface. Although many COVID-19 placental studies have focused on the expression of the canonical SARS-CoV-2 entry proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2, further characterization of subcellular molecules involved in viral trafficking have not yet been investigated in these tissues. Of interest are Rab proteins, a family of small GTPase proteins that direct intracellular transport between different endocytic organelles. Rab5 and Rab7 in particular have previously been implicated in HIV and cytomegalovirus invasion of placental trophoblast cells in vitro; the localization of these molecules has not been fully characterized within the human maternal-fetal interface, however, or within placental tissues from SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnancies. METHODS: Using fluorescent immunohistochemistry, Rab5 and Rab7 placental localization and comparative fluorescence intensity were explored in a cohort of placental tissues from pregnancies affected by maternal COVID-19 disease (COVID, n = 15) compared with contemporary control subjects (Control, n = 10). Fluorescence intensity was quantified by using corrected total cell fluorescence values. FINDINGS: Within placental villi, Rab5 was consistently localized in syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells. Rab5 had significantly higher mean (SEM) fluorescence intensity in the COVID cohort (Control, 1.96 [0.16]; COVID, 2.62 [0.09]; P = 0.0014). In contrast, although Rab7 was also localized within placental villous syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells, mean (SEM) Rab7 fluorescence intensity was significantly downregulated in COVID vs Control placentas (Control, 35.9 [4.1]; COVID, 20.1 [0.52]; P = 0.0001). IMPLICATIONS: This differential expression of Rab5 and Rab7 suggests that placental endocytic pathways may be altered at the maternal-fetal interface in pregnancies affected by maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. As key molecules governing intracellular vesicle transport, including viral trafficking, Rab GTPase proteins may be of interest for ongoing studies examining placental responses to COVID-19 in pregnancy.","Benarroch, Yoel; Juttukonda, Lillian; Sabharwal, Vishakha; Boateng, Jeffery; Khan, Amir R; Yarrington, Christina; Wachman, Elisha M; Taglauer, Elizabeth",Clin. ther,,81

458232,Rate control in atrial fibrillation using Landiolol is safe in critically ill Covid-19 patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: Rapid access to evidence is crucial in times of an evolving clinical crisis. To that end, we propose a novel approach to answer clinical queries, termed rapid meta-analysis (RMA). Unlike traditional meta-analysis, RMA balances a quick time to production with reasonable data quality assurances, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to strike this balance. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate whether RMA can generate meaningful clinical insights, but crucially, in a much faster processing time than traditional meta-analysis, using a relevant, real-world example. METHODS: The development of our RMA approach was motivated by a currently relevant clinical question: is ocular toxicity and vision compromise a side effect of hydroxychloroquine therapy? At the time of designing this study, hydroxychloroquine was a leading candidate in the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We then leveraged AI to pull and screen articles, automatically extract their results, review the studies, and analyze the data with standard statistical methods. RESULTS: By combining AI with human analysis in our RMA, we generated a meaningful, clinical result in less than 30 minutes. The RMA identified 11 studies considering ocular toxicity as a side effect of hydroxychloroquine and estimated the incidence to be 3.4% (95% CI 1.11%-9.96%). The heterogeneity across individual study findings was high, which should be taken into account in interpretation of the result. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that a novel approach to meta-analysis using AI can generate meaningful clinical insights in a much shorter time period than traditional meta-analysis.","Michelson, Matthew; Chow, Tiffany; Martin, Neil A; Ross, Mike; Tee Qiao Ying, Amelia; Minton, Steven",J Med Internet Res,,81

Despite the limited data on the possible pathogenetic mechanisms, evidence suggests that cognitive decline, and thus dementia and Alzheimer's disease, might arise from a complex interplay between type 2 diabetes and the aging brain, including decreased insulin signalling and glucose metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and vascular disease. Furthermore, there is increasing interest on the effects of antidiabetic agents on cognitive decline. There are many studies showing that antidiabetic agents might have beneficial effects on the brain, mainly through inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. In addition, experimental studies on patients with diabetes and Alzheimer's disease have shown beneficial effects on synaptic plasticity, metabolism of amyloid-ß, and microtubule-associated protein tau. Therefore, in the present review, we discuss the effects of antidiabetic agents in relation to cognitive decline, and in particular dementia and Alzheimer's disease, in patients with type 2 diabetes.","Papazafiropoulou, Athanasia K; Koros, Chris; Melidonis, Andreas; Antonopoulos, Stavros",Arch Med Sci Atheroscler Dis,,81

The objective of this study aimed to investigate the impression of copper (Cu)-triggered toxicity on mitochondrial dynamic, oxidative stress, and unfolded protein response (UPRmt) in fundic gland of pigs. Weaned pigs were randomly distributed into three groups, fed with different Cu of 10 mg/kg (control group), 125 mg/kg (group I), and 250 mg/kg (group â ¡). The trial persisted for 80 days and the fundic gland tissues were collected for further researches. Moreover, the markers participated to mitochondrial dynamic, UPRmtï¼and oxidative stress in fundic gland were determined. Results revealed that vacuolar degeneration were observed in the treated groups contrast with control group, and the Cu level was boosted with the increasing intake of Cu. Besides that, the levels of CAT, TRX, H2O2, and G6PDH were reduced in group â and group â ¡, the mRNA levels of NRF2, HO-1, SOD-1, CAT, SOD-2, GSR, GPX1, GPX4, and TRX in the treated groups were promoted contrast to control group. Furthermore, the protein expression of KEAP1 was dramatically decreased, and the protein expression of NRF2, TRX and HO-1 were markedly enhanced in group â and â ¡ at 80 days. Moreover, the mRNA and protein expression levels of MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1 down-regulated and protein level of DRP1 was increased with the adding levels of Cu. Nevertheless, the UPRmt-related mRNA levels of CLPP, HTRA-2, CHOP, HSP10, and HSP60 were enhanced dramatically in Cu treatment group compared with control group. In general, our current study demonstrated that excessive absorption of Cu in fundic gland were related with stimulating UPRmt, oxidative stress, and the NRF2 interceded antioxidant defense. These results could afford an updated evidence on molecular theory of Cu-invited toxicity.","Huo, Haihua; Wang, Shuzhou; Bai, Yuman; Liao, Jianzhao; Li, Xinrun; Zhang, Hui; Han, Qingyue; Hu, Lianmei; Pan, Jiaqiang; Li, Ying; Tang, Zhaoxin; Guo, Jianying",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,,81
461802,Oxygenation Strategies in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19,2021,"A novel disease, of unknown origin, causing a deadly pneumonia of human patients was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. Later called coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it rapidly spread across China and worldwide. Intensive research revealed that the etiological agent of the global COVID-19 pandemic was a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 genome contains typical coronavirus genes but the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S protein is highly specific. The site for furin-like protease cleavage of the S protein into S1 and S2 subunits is also unique. Further analyses suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is of zoonotic origin. The analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, especially the S gene, shows that natural evolutionary process between a bat-CoV and a pangolin-CoV or other animal coronavirus could have been important in creating SARS-CoV-2, with transmission of novel virus to the human population. On the other hand, new analyses indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is not a recombinant virus. Keywords: COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; genome; bat coronavirus; pangolin coronavirus.","Vilcek, S",Acta Virol,,81

Patient remote monitoring strategies are on the raise and may be an additional aid in identifying patients who are at risk of falling. The aim of the study was to evaluate if balance and timed-up-and-go data obtained by a smartphone application during COVID-19 lockdown were able to predict falls in PD patients. METHODS: A cohort of PD patients were monitored for 4 weeks during the COVID-19 lockdown with an application measuring static balance and timed-up-and-go test. The main outcome was the occurrence of falls (UPDRS-II item 13) during the observation period. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients completed the study, and 4 (12%) reported falls in the observation period. The rate of falls was reduced with respect to patient previous falls history (24%). The stand-up time and the mediolateral sway, acquired through the application, differed between ""fallers"" and ""non-fallers"" and related to the occurrence of new falls (OR 1.7 and 1.6 respectively, p < 0.05), together with previous falling (OR 7.5, p < 0.01). In a multivariate model, the stand-up time and the history of falling independently related to the outcome (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new data on falls in Parkinson's disease during the lockdown. The reduction of falling events and the relationship with the stand-up time might suggest that a different quality of falls occurs when patient is forced to stay home - hence, clinicians should point their attention also on monitoring patients' sit-to-stand body transition other than more acknowledged features based on step quality.","Marano, Massimo; Motolese, Francesco; Rossi, Mariagrazia; Magliozzi, Alessandro; Yekutieli, Ziv; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo",Neurol. sci,,81
467687,Correction to: Nationwide system to centralize decisions around ECMO use for severe COVID-19 pneumonia in Japan (Special Correspondence),2020,"Life expectancy is increasing and so is the prevalence of age-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Consequently, older people and patients present with multi-morbidities and more complex needs, putting significant pressure on healthcare systems. Effective nutrition interventions could be an important tool to address patient needs, improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Inflammation plays a central role in NCDs, so targeting it is relevant to disease prevention and treatment. The long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 LCPUFAs) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are known to reduce inflammation and promote its resolution, suggesting a beneficial role in various therapeutic areas. An expert group reviewed the data on omega-3 LCPUFAs in specific patient populations and medical conditions. Evidence for benefits in cognitive health, age- and disease-related decline in muscle mass, cancer treatment, surgical patients and critical illness was identified. Use of DHA and EPA in some conditions is already included in some relevant guidelines. However, it is important to note that data on the effects of omega-3 LCPUFAs are still inconsistent in many areas (e.g., cognitive decline) due to a range of factors that vary amongst the trials performed to date; these factors include dose, timing and duration; baseline omega-3 LCPUFA status; and intake of other nutrients. Well-designed intervention studies are required to optimize the effects of DHA and EPA in specific patient populations and to develop more personalized strategies for their use.","Troesch, Barbara; Eggersdorfer, Manfred; Laviano, Alessandro; Rolland, Yves; Smith, A David; Warnke, Ines; Weimann, Arved; Calder, Philip C",Nutrients,,81

Pupillary responses were measured using a pupillometry system. Dynamic pupil parameters (i.e., pupil contraction amplitude, pupil dilatation latency, pupil contraction latency, pupil dilatation duration, pupil dilatation velocity, pupil contraction duration, pupil contraction velocity, resting pupil diameter [PD]) and static pupil parameters (i.e., mesopic PD, scotopic PD, high photopic PD, and low photopic PD) were registered. RESULTS: Although high photopic and scotopic PDs were significantly higher in patients recovering from COVID-19 than in healthy controls (P = 0.04 and P = 0.002), no statistically significant difference was found in mesopic and low photopic PD (P = 0.19 and P = 0.41). Regarding dynamic pupillometry parameters, resting PD and pupil contraction velocity (P = 0.04 and P = 0.02, respectively) were significantly higher in patients recovering from COVID-19 than in healthy controls (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively), whereas pupil dilatation latency and pupil contraction duration were lower in these patients than in healthy controls (P = 0.01 and P = 0.008, respectively). No significant differences in pupil contraction amplitude, pupil dilatation duration, pupil contraction latency, and pupil dilatation velocity were found between the study groups (P = 0.93, P = 0.91, P = 0.42, and P = 0.48, respectively). CONCLUSION: Pupil responses, which are controlled by the ANS, were impaired in patients recovering from COVID-19. Pupillometry shows promise as a non-invasive, easy-to-apply diagnostic technology for detecting autonomic dysfunction in patients recovering from COVID-19.

476353,COVID-19: opening a new paradigm in thromboprophylaxis for critically ill patients?,2020,"The genetic characterization of a common phenotype for an entire population reveals both the causes of that phenotype for that place and the power of family-based, population-wide genomic analysis for gene and mutation discovery. We characterized the genetics of hearing loss throughout the Palestinian population, enrolling 2,198 participants from 491 families from all parts of the West Bank and Gaza. In Palestinian families with no prior history of hearing loss, we estimate that 56% of hearing loss is genetic and 44% is not genetic. For the great majority (87%) of families with inherited hearing loss, panel-based genomic DNA sequencing, followed by segregation analysis of large kindreds and transcriptional analysis of participant RNA, enabled identification of the causal genes and mutations, including at distant noncoding sites. Genetic heterogeneity of hearing loss was striking with respect to both genes and alleles: The 337 solved families harbored 143 different mutations in 48 different genes. For one in four solved families, a transcription-altering mutation was the responsible allele. Many of these mutations were cryptic, either exonic alterations of splice enhancers or silencers or deeply intronic events. Experimentally calibrated in silico analysis of transcriptional effects yielded inferences of high confidence for effects on splicing even of mutations in genes not expressed in accessible tissue. Most (58%) of all hearing loss in the population was attributable to consanguinity. Given the ongoing decline in consanguineous marriage, inherited hearing loss will likely be much rarer in the next generation.","Abu Rayyan, Amal; Kamal, Lara; Casadei, Silvia; Brownstein, Zippora; Zahdeh, Fouad; Shahin, Hashem; Canavati, Christina; Dweik, Dima; Jaraysa, Tamara; Rabie, Grace; Carlson, Ryan J; Gulsuner, Suleyman; Lee, Ming K; Avraham, Karen B; Walsh, Tom; King, Mary-Claire; Kanaan, Moien N",Proc.

Under these conditions, at-risk older adults are even more likely to be inactive and isolated, leading to potential exacerbation of musculoskeletal and chronic conditions and emotional distress. This case study provides an overview of our experience and best practices developed during our shift from onsite programming to virtual. Methodology: HSS utilized varied online approaches, including phone/video conference classes, webinars, on-demand videos and email campaigns to successfully transition programs. Due to this shift, HSS changed its evaluation to an online approach, using a mixed method to adequately assess the impact of programs. Results: Between April and August 2020, our virtual programs reached 428,766 participants, resulting in a 10,807% increase in program reach. Most participants assessed were 60 years or older (72%) and reported knowledge (85%) and self-management skills (83%) gained as well as high program satisfaction (90%).

It also assessed the impact of social distancing on pathologies presenting to ENT and reviewed the usefulness of telephone consultations in semi-urgent presentations. METHOD: A retrospective review was conducted of 97 instances of patient care carried out in the rapid access ENT clinic at a large district general hospital. RESULTS: Otitis externa and foreign bodies represented 25 per cent and 13 per cent of consultations respectively. Tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess were uncommon, representing 6 per cent of total consultations. Telephone appointments represented only 28 per cent of total consultations; however, they appeared to reduce the number of physical appointments required. CONCLUSION: Otitis externa and foreign bodies continue to be common during the pandemic. Social distancing measures reduced the number of tonsillitis and quinsy presentations. Telephone consultations are effective for certain urgent presentations to ENT, most noticeably nasal trauma and follow up of non-serious pathologies.","Stubington, T J; Morrison, B; Sevilla, C; Judd, O",J Laryngol Otol,,81

OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates qualitative outcomes with data insights from the electronic health record, to contrast satisfaction outcomes with the actual use of VC. METHODS: Healthcare providers and patients using VC during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large academic centre in the Netherlands were surveyed for user satisfaction and experiences with VC. In addition, quantitative technical assessment was performed using data related to VC from the EHR record. RESULTS: In total, 1,027/4,443 patients and 87/166 healthcare providers completed their online questionnaire. Users rated the use of VC during a pandemic with an average score of 8.3/10 and 7.6/10 respectively. Both groups believed the use of VC was a good solution to continue the provision of healthcare during this pandemic. The use of VC increased from 92 in March 2020 to 837 in April 2020. CONCLUSION: This study strongly signals that VC is an important modality in futureproofing outpatient care during and beyond pandemic times. Further development in end-user technology is needed for EHR integrated VC solutions. Guidelines needs to be developed advising both patients and healthcare providers. Such guidelines should not solely focus on technical implementation and troubleshooting, but must also consider important aspects such as digital health literacy, patient and provider authentication, privacy and ethics.","Barsom, E Z; Meijer, H A W; Blom, J; Schuuring, M J; Bemelman, W A; Schijven, M P",Int J Med Inform,,81
496015,"Cytokine adsorption in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (CYCOV): a single centre, open-label, randomised, controlled trial",2021,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a deadly respiratory illness associated with refractory hypoxemia and pulmonary edema. The recent pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 is associated with severe pneumonia and inflammatory cytokine storm in the lungs. The anti-inflammatory phytomedicine nimbolide (NIM) may not be feasible for clinical translation due to poor pharmacokinetic properties and lack of suitable delivery systems. To overcome these barriers, we have developed nimbolide liposomes conjugated with iRGD peptide (iRGD-NIMLip) for targeting lung inflammation. It was observed that iRGD-NIMLip treatment significantly inhibited oxidative stress and cytokine storm compared to nimbolide free-drug (f-NIM), nimbolide liposomes (NIMLip), and exhibited superior activity compared to dexamethasone (DEX). iRGD-NIMLip abrogated the LPS induced p65 NF-&#954;B, Akt, MAPK, Integrin ß3 and ß5, STAT3, and DNMT1 expression. Collectively, our results demonstrate that iRGD-NIMLip could be a promising novel drug delivery system to target severe pathological consequences observed in ARDS and COVID-19 associated cytokine storm.","Pooladanda, Venkatesh; Thatikonda, Sowjanya; Sunnapu, Omprakash; Tiwary, Shristy; Vemula, Praveen Kumar; Talluri, M V N Kumar; Godugu, Chandraiah",Nanomedicine,,81

499111,Large-scale ICU data sharing for global collaboration: the first 1633 critically ill COVID-19 patients in the Dutch Data Warehouse,2021,"Since the detection of the first case of COVID-19 in Chile on March 3rd, 2020, a total of 513,188 cases, including ~14,302 deaths have been reported in Chile as of November 2nd, 2020. Here, we estimate the reproduction number throughout the epidemic in Chile and study the effectiveness of control interventions especially the effectiveness of lockdowns by conducting short-term forecasts based on the early transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Chile's incidence curve displays early sub-exponential growth dynamics with the deceleration of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8) and the reproduction number, R, estimated at 1.8 (95% CI: 1.6, 1.9). Our findings indicate that the control measures at the start of the epidemic significantly slowed down the spread of the virus. However, the relaxation of restrictions and spread of the virus in low-income neighborhoods in May led to a new surge of infections, followed by the reimposition of lockdowns in Greater Santiago and other municipalities. These measures have decelerated the virus spread with R estimated at ~0.96 (95% CI: 0.95, 0.98) as of November 2nd, 2020. The early sub-exponential growth trend (p ~0.8) of the COVID-19 epidemic transformed into a linear growth trend (p ~0.5) as of July 7th, 2020, after the reimposition of lockdowns. While the broad scale social distancing interventions have slowed the virus spread, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accrue, underscoring the need for persistent social distancing and active case detection and isolation efforts to maintain the epidemic under control.","Tariq, Amna; Undurraga, Eduardo A; Laborde, Carla Castillo; Vogt-Geisse, Katia; Luo, Ruiyan; Rothenberg, Richard; Chowell, Gerardo",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,81

In some parts of sub-Saharan Africa, chimpanzee tracking is a popular tourism activity, offering visitors a chance to view apes in their natural habitats. Chimpanzee tourism is an important source of revenue and thus benefits conservation; however, chimpanzee tracking may also increase the risk of disease transmission from people to chimpanzees directly (e.g., via aerosol transmission) or indirectly (e.g., through the environment or via fomites). This study assessed how tourist behaviors might facilitate respiratory disease transmission at a chimpanzee tracking site in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We observed tourists, guides, and student interns from the time they entered the forest to view the chimpanzees until they left the forest and noted behaviors related to disease transmission. Common behaviors included coughing, sneezing, and urinating, which respectively occurred during 88.1%, 65.4%, and 36.6% of excursions. Per excursion, individuals touched their faces an average of 125.84 ± 34.45 times and touched large tree trunks or branches (which chimpanzees might subsequently touch) an average of 230.14 ± 108.66 times. These results show that many pathways exist by which pathogens might move from humans to chimpanzees in the context of tourism. Guidelines for minimizing the risk of such transmission should consider tourist behavior and the full range of modes by which pathogen transmission might occur between tourists and chimpanzees.","Glasser, Darcey B; Goldberg, Tony L; Guma, Nelson; Balyesiima, Godfrey; Agaba, Hillary; Gessa, Simplicious J; Rothman, Jessica M",Am J Primatol,,81

508436,Effect of thiamine supplementation in critically ill patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Few anecdotal cases have been reported in the literature regarding heart transplant recipients and infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We report our experience with 6 patients hospitalized in Northern Italy during the outbreak. METHODS: Of the 396 living heart transplant recipients from 1985 to 2020 included in the study, 6 patients developed the novel 2019 coronavirus disease. Risk factors, last follow-up characteristics, onset presentation, in-hospital course of disease and blood examinations data were collected for these patients. RESULTS: All patients were symptomatic and had positive results from a nasopharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2. Of the 6 patients, 5 were hospitalized and 1 remained self-quarantined at home. Two patients died and 3 were discharged home. Two patients were admittted to the intensive care unit . Immunosuppressive therapy was modified with a median reduction comprising doses that were 50% cyclosporine and 50% mycophenolate. All patients received a medium-dose of corticosteroids as a bolus medication in addition to their therapy. All hospitalized patients received hydroxychloroquine; 2 patients received ritonavir/lopinavir. Broad-spectrum antibiotics for prophylaxis were administered to all. One patient had an ischaemic stroke and died of sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of any strong evidence regarding the treatment of heart transplant recipients infected with SARS-CoV-2, we faced a new challenge in managing viral infection in an immunosuppressed population. Because immunomodulation interaction with the infection seems to be crucial for developing severe forms of the disease, we managed to reduce immunosuppressive therapy by adding medium doses of corticosteroids. Despite the limited number of affected patients, this report suggests that special considerations should be given to treating coronavirus disease in the heart transplant recipient population.","Caraffa, Raphael; Bagozzi, Lorenzo; Fiocco, Alessandro; Bifulco, Olimpia; Nadali, Matteo; Ponzoni, Matteo; Carrozzini, Massimiliano; Toscano, Giuseppe; Fraiese, Angela Pompea; Metra, Marco; Lombardi, Carlo Maria; Serafini, Francesco; Ribola, Angela; Jorgji, Vjola; Bottio, Tomaso; Gerosa, Gino",Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,,81

In the time of an epidemic crisis, we hope artificial intelligence (AI) to reduce physician workload in regions with the outbreak, and improve the diagnosis accuracy for physicians before they could acquire enough experience with the new disease. In this paper, we present our experience in building and deploying an AI system that automatically analyzes CT images and provides the probability of infection to rapidly detect COVID-19 pneumonia. The proposed system which consists of classification and segmentation will save about 30%-40% of the detection time for physicians and promote the performance of COVID-19 detection. Specifically, working in an interdisciplinary team of over 30 people with medical and/or AI background, geographically distributed in Beijing and Wuhan, we are able to overcome a series of challenges (e.g. data discrepancy, testing time-effectiveness of model, data security, etc.) in this particular situation and deploy the system in four weeks. In addition, since the proposed AI system provides the priority of each CT image with probability of infection, the physicians can confirm and segregate the infected patients in time. Using 1,136 training cases (723 positives for COVID-19) from five hospitals, we are able to achieve a sensitivity of 0.974 and specificity of 0.922 on the test dataset, which included a variety of pulmonary diseases.","Wang, Bo; Jin, Shuo; Yan, Qingsen; Xu, Haibo; Luo, Chuan; Wei, Lai; Zhao, Wei; Hou, Xuexue; Ma, Wenshuo; Xu, Zhengqing; Zheng, Zhuozhao; Sun, Wenbo; Lan, Lan; Zhang, Wei; Mu, Xiangdong; Shi, Chenxi; Wang, Zhongxiao; Lee, Jihae; Jin, Zijian; Lin, Minggui; Jin, Hongbo; Zhang, Liang; Guo, Jun; Zhao, Benqi; Ren, Zhizhong; Wang, Shuhao; Xu, Wei; Wang, Xinghuan; Wang, Jianming; You, Zheng; Dong, Jiahong",Appl Soft Comput,,81

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify factors affecting telehealth acceptance, including anxiety related to COVID-19, after the initial rapid spread of the disease in South Korea. METHODS: We proposed an extended technology acceptance model (TAM) and performed a cross-sectional survey of individuals aged &#8805;30 years. In total, 471 usable responses were collected. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine the validity of measurements, and the partial least squares (PLS) method was used to investigate factors influencing telehealth acceptance and the impacts of COVID-19. RESULTS: PLS analysis showed that increased accessibility, enhanced care, and ease of telehealth use had positive effects on its perceived usefulness (P=.002, P<.001, and P<.001, respectively). Furthermore, perceived usefulness, ease, and privacy/discomfort significantly impacted the acceptance of telehealth (P<.001, P<.001, and P<.001, respectively). However, anxiety toward COVID-19 was not associated with telehealth acceptance (P=.112), and this insignificant relationship was consistent in the cluster (n=216, 46%) of respondents with chronic diseases (P=.185). CONCLUSIONS: Increased accessibility, enhanced care, usefulness, ease of use, and privacy/discomfort are decisive variables affecting telehealth acceptance in the Korean general population, whereas anxiety about COVID-19 is not.

521878,Efficacy and safety of Jinhua Qinggan granules for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A protocol of a systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: COVID-19 is a global public health concern. As no standard treatment has been found for it yet, several minerals and vitamins with antioxidants, immunomodulators, and antimicrobials roles can be sufficient for the immune response against the disease. The present study evaluates the serum vitamin D, calcium, and Zinc levels in patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS & METHODS: This research is a case-control study performed in May 2020 on 93 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a Shoushtar city hospital and on 186 healthy subjects with no symptoms of COVID-19. The serum vitamin D, calcium, and zinc levels were collected and analyzed using correlation coefficient and independent t-test via SPSS 18. RESULTS: Vitamin D levels had a significant difference between the case and control groups (p = 0.008). Serum calcium and serum zinc levels also had statistically significant differences between the two groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The research results showed that serum zinc, calcium, and vitamin D levels in COVID-19 patients are lower than in the control group. The supplementation with such nutrients is a safe and low-cost measure that can help cope with the increased demand for these nutrients in risk of acquiring the COVID-19 virus.","Elham, Abdolahi Shahvali; Azam, Khalighi; Azam, Jahangirimehr; Mostafa, Labibzadeh; Nasrin, Bahmanyari; Marzieh, Najafi",Clin Nutr ESPEN,,81
590268,A critical appraisal of the effects of anesthetics on immune system modulation in critically ill patients with COVID-19,2021-01-09,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is placing significant pressure on national and international health organizations and the measures taken to combat it are having many impacts beyond health. At the same time, misleading communication practices and what has been called an “infodemic” by the World Health Organization have been hampering the uptake of coronavirus-related scientific information. Moreover, public awareness about the dangers of the infodemic remains poor, and misinformation may lead to hazardous behaviours. We therefore analysed factors potentially undermining communication of scientific evidence and proposed strategies to counteract this phenomenon. METHODS: We sought official academic and institutional publications of any type, published in English and analyzed their approaches to communication used during the pandemic. RESULTS: The factors that might undermine appropriate communication include but are not limited to (a) the exponential increase of COVID-19-related publications, often including biases in the peer-review and editorial process; (b) the role of traditional media; (c) politicization of the virus; and (d) the impact of social media. We argue that evidence synthesis and knowledge translation are useful tools to communicate accurate scientific evidence to decision-makers. CONCLUSION: Clear and concise messages in this form can help decision-makers to interpret data correctly, take consequent actions, and avoid being compromised by low-quality or even misleading information.","La Bella, Epaminondas; Allen, Claire; Lirussi, Flavio",Integr Med Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213422021000184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34141575/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213422021000184; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imr.2021.100731,81

About 74% of women reported that their intimate relationships with their husbands did not change during the COVID-19 pandemic. About 77% of women reported that their sexual desires have no changes during this period, while about 17% of them reported that sexual desire of both themselves and their spouse were reduced. In the present study, in some participants in the COVID-19 pandemic, the sexual desire and the frequency of sexual intercourse was reduced, which could indicate the negative impact of this epidemic infection on the couple's sexual health. Therefore, it is recommended that the sexologist and reproductive health professionals provide comprehensive sexual health care guidelines for pre-, during-, and post-crisis stages. Also, since psychological problems and, consequently, problems related to marital and sexual relationships during the COVID-19 epidemic crisis may persist for a long time after the infection is eradicated, it is recommended that sexual and reproductive health professionals take steps to improve Sexual health of couples.","Banaei, Mojdeh; Ghasemi, Vida; Dordeh, Mohammad; Roozbeh, Nasibeh",Galen Med J,https://doi.org/10.31661/gmj.v9i0.1928; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34466615/,81
590352,Cardiac surgery during the times of COVID-19,2020-07-20,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has necessitated the implementation of innovative health care models in preparation for an influx of patients. A virtual ward model delivers clinical care remotely to patients in isolation. We report on an Australian cohort of patients with COVID-19 treated in a virtual ward. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe and evaluate the safety and efficacy of a virtual ward model of care for an Australian cohort of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective clinical assessment was performed for 223 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated in a virtual ward in Brisbane, Australia, from March 25 to May 15, 2020. Statistical analysis was performed for variables associated with the length of stay and hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 223 patients, 205 (92%) recovered without the need for escalation to hospital care. The median length of stay in the virtual ward was 8 days (range 1-44 days). In total, 18 (8%) patients were referred to hospital, of which 6 (33.3%) were discharged after assessment at the emergency department. Furthermore, 12 (5.4%) patients were admitted to hospital, of which 4 (33.3%) required supplemental oxygen and 2 (16.7%) required mechanical ventilation. No deaths were recorded. Factors associated with escalation to hospital care were the following: hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 3.6, 95% CI 1.28-9.87; P=.01), sputum production (OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.74-15.49; P=.001), and arthralgia (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.21-11.71; P=.02) at illness onset and a polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold of ≤20 on a diagnostic nasopharyngeal swab (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.25-19.63; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a virtual ward model of care to treat patients with COVID-19 is safe and efficacious, and only a small number of patients would potentially require escalation to hospital care. Further studies are required to validate this model of care.","Ferry, Olivia R; Moloney, Emma C; Spratt, Owen T; Whiting, Gerald F M; Bennett, Cameron J",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/25518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33529157/,81

On 29th April 2020, Malaysia reported more than 5,000 COVID-19 cases; the second highest in the Southeast Asian region after Singapore. Recently, a forecasting model was developed to measure and predict COVID-19 cases in Malaysia on daily basis for the next 10 days using previously-confirmed cases. A Recurrent Forecasting-Singular Spectrum Analysis (RF-SSA) is proposed by establishing L and ET parameters via several tests. The advantage of using this forecasting model is it would discriminate noise in a time series trend and produce significant forecasting results. The RF-SSA model assessment was based on the official COVID-19 data released by the World Health Organization (WHO) to predict daily confirmed cases between 30th April and 31st May, 2020. These results revealed that parameter L = 5 (T/20) for the RF-SSA model was indeed suitable for short-time series outbreak data, while the appropriate number of eigentriples was integral as it influenced the forecasting results. Evidently, the RF-SSA had over-forecasted the cases by 0.36%. This signifies the competence of RF-SSA in predicting the impending number of COVID-19 cases. Nonetheless, an enhanced RF-SSA algorithm should be developed for higher effectivity of capturing any extreme data changes.","Shaharudin, Shazlyn Milleana; Ismail, Shuhaida; Hassan, Noor Artika; Tan, Mou Leong; Sulaiman, Nurul Ainina Filza",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.604093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34195166/,81

The growth and expansion of world trade over the past half century amid economic globalisation, and the increased importance of health issues to the functioning of a more interconnected world, brings the two domains closer together on a broad range of issues.

Structural characterisation of the Spike carrying point mutations aids in our understanding of how these mutations impact binding of the protein to its human receptor, ACE2, and to therapeutic antibodies. The Spike G485R mutation has been observed in multiple isolates of the virus and mutation of the adjacent residue E484 to lysine is known to contribute to antigenic escape. Here, we have crystallised the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain with a G485R mutation in complex with human ACE2. The crystal structure shows that while the G485 residue does not have a direct interaction with ACE2, its mutation to arginine affects the structure of the loop made by residues 480-488 in the receptor-binding motif, disrupting the interactions of neighbouring residues with ACE2 and with potential implications for antigenic escape from vaccines, antibodies and other biologics directed against SARS-CoV-2 Spike.","Weekley, Claire M.; Purcell, Damian F.

These diseases include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Ebola. With the current (SARS-CoV-2) global pandemic, it is critical to delineate appropriate contextual respiratory protection for HCWs. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs) as part of respiratory protection versus another device (egN95/FFP2) on HCW infection rates and contamination. Methods Our primary outcomes included HCW infection rates with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, Ebola or MERS when utilizing PAPR. We included randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and observational studies. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CENTRAL). Two reviewers independently screened all citations, full-text articles, and abstracted data. Due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity, we did not conduct a meta-analysis. Where applicable, we constructed Evidence Profile (EP) tables for each individual outcome. Confidence in cumulative evidence for each outcome was classified according to the GRADE system. Results We identified 689 studies during literature searches. We included 10 full text studies. A narrative synthesis was provided. Two on-field studies reported no difference in the rates of healthcare workers performing airway procedures during care of critical patients with SARS-CoV-2. A single simulation trial reported a lower level of cross-contamination of participants using PAPR compared to alternative respiratory protection. There is moderate quality evidence that PAPR use is associated with greater heat tolerance but lower scores for mobility and communication ability. We identified a trend toward greater self-reported wearer comfort with PAPR technology in low quality observational simulation studies. Conclusion Field observational studies do not indicate a difference in healthcare worker infection utilizing PAPR devices versus other compliant respiratory equipment. Greater heat tolerance accompanied by lower scores of mobility and audibility in PAPR were identified . Further pragmatic studies are needed in order to delineate actual effectiveness and provider satisfaction with PAPR technology.

In addition, primary and secondary pancreatitis have been described in COVID-19 patients. There is limited information on how the groups compare in outcomes. The aim is to compare outcomes among these groups. Methods: This is a retrospective study from 12 hospitals within one healthcare system examining outcomes between hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a lipase <3x upper limit of normal (ULN), asymptomatic hyperlipasemia (>3x ULN), secondary pancreatitis (typical respiratory COVID-19 symptoms and found to have pancreatitis), and primary pancreatitis (presenting with pancreatitis). Results: Of 11,883 patients admitted with COVID-19, 1,560 patients were included: 1,155 COVID-19 patients with a normal serum lipase (control group), 270 with an elevated lipase <3x ULN, 46 patients with asymptomatic hyperlipasemia with a lipase 3xULN, 57 patients with secondary pancreatitis, and 32 patients with primary pancreatitis. On adjusted multivariate analysis, the elevated lipase <3x ULN and asymptomatic hyperlipasemia groups had worse outcomes. The mortality was OR1.6 (95% CI 1.2-2.2) and 1.1 (95% CI 0.5-2.3), respectively. The need for mechanical ventilation was OR 2.8 (95% CI 1.2-2.1) and 2.8 (95% CI 1.5-5.2), respectively. Longer length of stay was OR 1.5 (95%CI 1.1-2.0) and 3.16 (95%CI 1.5-6.5), respectively. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients with an elevated lipase< 3x ULN and asymptomatic hyperlipasemia have generally worse outcomes than those with pancreatitis. This could be attributed to extrapancreatic causes (liver failure, renal failure, enteritis, etc), which may signify a more severe course of clinical disease.

CoVID-19 infection is a pandemic, surface to surface communicable disease with a case fatality rate of 3.4% as estimated by WHO up to March 3rd 2020. Unfortunately, the current unavailability of an effective antiviral drug and approved vaccine, worsen the situation more critical. Implementation of an effective preventive measure is the only option left to counteract CoVID-19. Further, a retrospective analysis provides evidence that contemplates the decisive role of preventive measures in controlling severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. A statistical surveillance report of WHO reflects, maintaining a coherent infection, prevention and control guideline resulted in a 30% reduction in healthcare-associated infections. The effectiveness of preventive measures completely relies on the strength of surface disinfectants, the composition of hand sanitizer, appropriate material for the manufacture of personal protective equipment (PPE).

Members of the general population completed an online questionnaire. Responses from 1274 participants (1274/1568, 81% completion rate) indicated that the majority (46.1%, n = 587) of people were more active than usual during the restrictions, however, 28.6% (n = 365) reported being less active. Fifty-five percent (55.3%, n = 702) of participants were meeting public health physical activity guidelines and more than half (53.3%, n = 679) reported finding new ways to be active. Walking (86%, n = 1101), physical activity in the home (47%, n = 593) and online resources (38%, n = 483) were the most frequently reported types of physical activity people engaged in. Having more time to be physically active [OR 2.326 (SD 1.948–2.794)] and a greater belief in the importance of physical activity [OR 1.192 (SD 1.001–1.444)] were predictive of exercising more than usual. Being unable to access their usual means of exercise [OR 1.612 (SD 1.369–1.902)], advised not to go outside the home [OR 1.402 (SD 1.165–1.698)] and working more than usual [OR 1.201 (SD 1.013–1.443)] were predictive of exercising less than usual. There was a positive trend in physical activity engagement by Irish adults during initial COVID-19 restrictions, likely influenced by increased time, belief that exercise was important and increased use of home-based and online exercise resources.

Acute bronchitis is among the most common ambulatory complaints. Although the cause of acute bronchitis is predominantly viral, 50–70% of patients presenting with this condition are treated with antibiotics. Because of the increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics, the cost of prescription drugs, and the potential adverse reactions to them, the present management of acute bronchitis has important shortcomings. Also, inhaled bronchodilators are underused for symptomatic management. Improved awareness among physicians about the recommended management of acute bronchitis has been targeted as an important means of decreasing unnecessary antibiotic use. Patient satisfaction motivates physicians to prescribe antibiotics in managing acute bronchitis. However, patient satisfaction does not necessarily correlate with prescribing of antibiotics but rather with patient education.

Here, we utilized single-cell sequencing to profile SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cells in 38 COVID-19 patients. Using oligo-tagged antigen baits, we isolated B cells specific to the SARS-CoV-2 spike, nucleoprotein (NP), open reading frame 8 (ORF8), and endemic coronavirus (HCoV) spike proteins. SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific cells were enriched in the memory compartment of acutely infected and convalescent patients several months post-symptom onset. With severe acute infection, substantial populations of endemic HCoV-reactive antibody-secreting cells were identified and possessed highly mutated variable genes, signifying preexisting immunity. Finally, MBCs exhibited pronounced maturation to NP and ORF8 over time, especially in older patients. Monoclonal antibodies against these targets were non-neutralizing and non-protective in vivo. These findings reveal antibody adaptation to non-neutralizing intracellular antigens during infection, emphasizing the importance of vaccination for inducing neutralizing spike-specific MBCs.","Dugan, Haley L.; Stamper, Christopher T.; Li, Lei; Changrob, Siriruk; Asby, Nicholas W.; Halfmann, Peter J.; Zheng, Nai-Ying; Huang, Min; Shaw, Dustin G.; Cobb, Mari S.; Erickson, Steven A.; Guthmiller, Jenna J.; Stovicek, Olivia; Wang, Jiaolong; Winkler, Emma S.; Madariaga, Maria Lucia; Shanmugarajah, Kumaran; Jansen, Maud O.; Amanat, Fatima; Stewart, Isabelle; Utset, Henry A.; Huang, Jun; Nelson, Christopher A.; Dai, Ya-Nan; Hall, Paige D.; Jedrzejczak, Robert P.; Joachimiak, Andrzej; Krammer, Florian; Diamond, Michael S.; Fremont, Daved H.; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Wilson, Patrick C.",Immunity,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761321001989?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34022127/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2021.05.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761321001989,81

We also attempt to create a functional loaf enriched with grape seed meal. To achieve this goal, 3, 6, and 9% of the grape seed meal were added to the loaves made of bread flour and gluten-free flour mixture, and then the changes in their antioxidant and polyphenol content were examined. Based on the results, there were significant differences between the polyphenol and antioxidant content of grape seed varieties. The antioxidant content of the grape seeds varied between 228.50 mg AAE/g (94.80 mg TE/g) and 438.33 mg AAE/g (181.86 mg TE/g) in case of fatty samples, and between 176.29 mg AAE/g (41.24 mg TE/g) and 424.91 mg AAE/g (99.40 mg TE/g) in case of defatted samples. The total polyphenol content of the fatty samples changed between 91.16 and 221.81 mg GAE/g; in case of defatted samples, it ranged from 46.01 to 207.68 mg GAE/g. Rhine Riesling contained the greatest amount of these compounds. The functionality of loafs was confirmed by spectrophotometric analysis. Total polyphenol content ranged from 0.91 to 3.16 mg GAE/g in case of wheat loafs, and from 1.39 to 5.92 mg GAE/g in case of gluten-free loafs, while the total antioxidant content changed between 0.70 and 6.44 mg AAE/g in case of wheat loafs, and ranged from 2.55 to 9.75 in case of gluten-free loafs.

This state-of-the-art review examines the last decade of research to: (1) describe the impact of the severity and persistence of food insecurity on child development; (2) use a socio-ecological framework to examine significant proximal and distal factors which may interplay; and (3) outline directions for future research. We conducted a systematic review of six databases of published papers from 2011 to June 2021. The search was limited to high-income countries and children aged from birth to 12 years. From 17,457 papers, 17 studies were included in the final review. Transitioning between food security and food insecurity had a significant and lasting effect on academic/cognitive function and behavior (i.e., externalizing), however less clear relationships were seen for psychosocial outcomes and other behaviors examined (i.e., internalizing). There was significant variation in the measurement and thresholds used to define both food insecurity and child development outcomes. Subsequently, comparisons across studies are difficult. Several future recommendations, including incorporation of socio-ecological factors, is provided. In conclusion, this review supports the link between food insecurity and sub-optimal child development; however, there is an imperative to improve and extend current understanding to ameliorate the causes of food insecurity.","Gallegos, Danielle; Eivers, Areana; Sondergeld, Peter; Pattinson, Cassandra",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501578/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18178990,81

We show that mask mandates are associated with a statistically significant decrease in new cases (-3.55 per 100K), deaths (-0.13 per 100K), and the proportion of hospital admissions (-2.38 percentage points) up to 40 days after the introduction of mask mandates both at the state and county level. These effects are large, corresponding to 14% of the highest recorded number of cases, 13% of deaths, and 7% of admission proportion. We also find that mask mandates are linked to a 23.4 percentage point increase in mask adherence in four diverse states. Given the recent lifting of mandates, we estimate that the ending of mask mandates in these states is associated with a decrease of -3.19 percentage points in mask adherence and 12 per 100K (13% of the highest recorded number) of daily new cases with no significant effect on hospitalizations and deaths. Lastly, using a large novel survey dataset of 847 thousand responses in 69 countries, we introduce the novel results that community mask adherence and community attitudes towards masks are associated with a reduction in COVID-19 cases and deaths. Our results have policy implications for reinforcing the need to maintain and encourage mask-wearing by the public, especially in light of some states starting to remove their mask mandates.","Adjodah, Dhaval; Dinakar, Karthik; Chinazzi, Matteo; Fraiberger, Samuel P.; Pentland, Alex; Bates, Samantha; Staller, Kyle; Vespignani, Alessandro; Bhatt, Deepak L.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34161332/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252315,81
607436,Reply to a fibrinolysis-first strategy for ST-elevation myocardial infarction in the COVID-19 era,2021-09-25,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented disruptions and stress in the lives of children and families internationally. Heightened family stress and turmoil can increase risk for, and exacerbate, child maltreatment. As a result, child maltreatment experts are concerned that there will be an influx of children requiring trauma assessment and treatment during and after COVID-19. As physical distancing measures have been implemented and will likely persist into 2021, organizations providing trauma treatment to children and their families have had to rapidly pivot to telemental health to maintain service delivery with clients. While the benefits of telemental health have been identified, including reduced barriers to access, increased cost effectiveness, and broad availability of services, there are unique limitations to its implementation within a child maltreatment population, such as challenges with attention and emotion regulation skills, difficulties identifying dissociative symptoms, and increased time with perpetrators of abuse due to shelter in place orders. These limitations are exacerbated for children and families who are most marginalized and facing the highest levels of social and economic barriers. Lack of access to reliable technology, lack of a private or confidential space for sessions, and reluctance to process trauma in the absence of a safe environment, are all barriers to conducting effective trauma treatment over telemental health. This article discusses both the benefits and barriers to telemental health in a child maltreatment population and offers considerations for child trauma service provision, program development, and policy during and post the COVID-19 pandemic.","Racine, Nicole; Hartwick, Cailey; Collin-Vézina, Delphine; Madigan, Sheri",Child Abuse Negl,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145213420303537; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145213420303537?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839022/,81

Through a nationally representative survey of 1027 adult Americans conducted in February 2021, this study examined individual misconceptions about COVID-19 vaccine safety; the demographic factors associated with these misconceptions; and the relationship between misconceptions and willingness to vaccinate. Misconceptions about vaccine safety were widespread. A sizeable minority (40%) believed that vaccine side effects are commonly severe or somewhat severe; 85% significantly underestimated the size and scale of the clinical trials; and a sizeable share believed either that the vaccines contain live coronavirus (10%) or were unsure (38%), a proxy for fears that vaccination itself may cause infection. These misconceptions were particularly acute among Republicans, Blacks, individuals with lower levels of educational attainment, and unvaccinated individuals. Perceived side effect severity and underestimating the size of the clinical trials were both significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy.","Kreps, Sarah E.; Goldfarb, Jillian L.; Brownstein, John S.; Kriner, Douglas L.",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9080901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452025/,81
608759,Magnetic resonance neurography findings in three critically ill COVID-19 patients with new onset of extremity peripheral neuropathy,2021-06-28,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant diversion of human and material resources to COVID-19 diagnostics, to the extent that testing of viral pathogens normally contributing to seasonal respiratory tract infections have been markedly neglected. The global health burden due to influenza viruses and co-infection in COVID-19 patients remains undocumented but clearly pose serious public health consequences. To address these clinical and technical challenges, we have optimized and validated a highly sensitive RT-PCR based multiplex assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A and B viruses in a single test. Methods: This study evaluated clinical specimens (n=1411) that included 1019 saliva and 392 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples collected in either healthcare or community setting. Samples were tested using two assays: FDA-EUA approved SARS-CoV-2 assay that targets N and ORF1ab gene, and the PKamp RT-PCR based assay that targets SARS-CoV-2, Influenza viruses A and B. The limit of detection (LoD) studies was conducted as per the FDA guidelines using SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A and B reference control materials. Results: Of the 1019 saliva samples, 17.0% (174/1019) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using either assay. The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was higher with our multiplex assay compared to SARS-specific assay [91.9% (160/174) vs. 87.9% (153/174)], respectively. Of the 392 NPS samples, 10.4% (41/392) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using either assay. The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was higher with our multiplex assay compared to SARS-specific assay [97.5% (40/41) vs. 92.1% (39/41)], respectively. The Ct values for SARS-CoV-2 were comparable between the two assays, whereas the Ct values of the housekeeping gene was significantly lower with multiplex assay compared to SARS-specific assay. The LoD was established as 60 copies/ml for SARS-CoV-2 and 180 copies/ml for Influenza A and B viruses for both saliva and NPS samples. Conclusion: This study presents clinical validation of a multiplex PCR assay for testing SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A and B viruses, using NPS and saliva samples, and demonstrates the feasibility of implementing the assay without disrupting the existing laboratory workflow. This novel assay uses the same instruments, sample types, supplies, and laboratory personnel as needed for the testing of SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Sahajpal, N. S.; Mondal, A.

The results often largely depend on the approach used to value mortality risk reductions, typically expressed as the value per statistical life (VSL). Many analyses rely on a population‐average VSL estimate; some adjust VSL for life expectancy at the age of death. We explore the implications of theory and empirical studies, which suggest that the relationship between age and VSL is uncertain. We compare the effects of three approaches: (1) an invariant population‐average VSL; (2) a constant value per statistical life‐year (VSLY); and (3) a VSL that follows an inverse‐U pattern, peaking in middle age. We find that when applied to the U.S. age distribution of COVID‐19 deaths, these approaches result in average VSL estimates of $10.63 million, $4.47 million, and $8.31 million. We explore the extent to which applying these estimates alters the conclusions of frequently cited analyses of social distancing, finding that they significantly affect the findings. However, these analyses do not address other characteristics of COVID‐19 deaths that may increase or decrease the VSL estimates. Examples include the health status and income level of those affected, the size of the risk change, and the extent to which the risk is dreaded, uncertain, involuntarily incurred, and outside of one's control. The effects of these characteristics and their correlation with age are uncertain; it is unclear whether they amplify or diminish the effects of age on VSL.","Robinson, Lisa A.; Sullivan, Ryan; Shogren, Jason F.",Risk Anal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32677076/; https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.13561,81

Currently, the standard paradigm for HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) is based on central air systems that tie delivery of heating and cooling to delivery of fresh air. To prevent heat loss, the delivery of fresh air must be tightly controlled and often limited through recirculation of already heated air. Buildings are designed with air-tight envelopes, which do not allow for natural ventilation, and depend on energy-intensive central-air systems. As closed environments, buildings have become sites of rapid COVID-19 transmission. In this research, we demonstrate the energy cost of increasing outdoor air supply with standard systems per COVID-19 recommendations and introduce an alternative HVAC paradigm that maximizes the decoupling of ventilation and thermal control. We first consider a novel analysis of the energy costs of increasing the amount of conditioned fresh air using standard HVAC systems to address COVID-19 concerns. We then present an alternative that includes a novel membrane-assisted radiant system we have studied for cooling in humid climates, in place of an air conditioning system. The proposed system can work in conjunction with natural ventilation and thus decreases the risk of indoor spread of infectious diseases and significantly lowers energy consumption in buildings. Our results modeling HVAC energy in different climates show increased outdoor air in standard HVAC systems can double cooling costs, while increasing natural ventilation with radiant systems can halve HVAC costs. More specifically it is possible to add up to 100 days’ worth of natural ventilation while saving energy, when coupling natural ventilation and radiant systems. This combination decreases energy cost by 10-45% in 60 major cities globally, while increasing fresh air intake.","Aviv, Dorit; Wee Chen, Kian; Teitelbaum, Eric; Sheppard, Denon; Pantelic, Jovan; Rysanek, Adam; Meggers, Forrest",Appl Energy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116848; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306261921003421; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921003421?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33776191/,81

Acceptance of IMI, a key facilitator of their implementation in routine care, is often low. Based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), this study validates and adapts the UTAUT to digital health care. Following a systematic literature search, 10 UTAUT-grounded original studies (N = 1588) assessing patients' and health professionals' acceptance of IMI for different somatic and mental health conditions were included. All included studies assessed Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Facilitating Conditions and acceptance as well as age, gender, internet experience, and internet anxiety via self-report questionnaires. For the model validation primary data was obtained and analyzed using structural equation modeling. The best fitting model (RMSEA = 0.035, SRMR = 0.029) replicated the basic structure of UTAUT's core predictors of acceptance. Performance Expectancy was the strongest predictor (γ = 0.68, p < .001). Internet anxiety was identified as an additional determinant of acceptance (γ = −0.07, p < .05) and moderated the effects of Social Influence (γ = 0.07, p < .05) and Effort Expectancy (γ = −0.05, p < .05). Age, gender and experience had no moderating effects. Acceptance is a fundamental prerequisite for harnessing the full potential of IMI.

614663,Simulation-based uptraining improves provider comfort in the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19,2020-10-03,"BACKGROUND: The complex interplay between viral replication and host immune response during infection remains poorly understood. While many viruses are known to employ anti-immune strategies to facilitate their replication, highly pathogenic virus infections can also cause an excessive immune response that exacerbates, rather than reduces pathogenicity. To investigate this dichotomy in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), we developed a transcriptional network model of SARS-CoV infection in mice and used the model to prioritize candidate regulatory targets for further investigation. RESULTS: We validated our predictions in 18 different knockout (KO) mouse strains, showing that network topology provides significant predictive power to identify genes that are important for viral infection. We identified a novel player in the immune response to virus infection, Kepi, an inhibitory subunit of the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex, which protects against SARS-CoV pathogenesis. We also found that receptors for the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) promote pathogenesis, presumably through excessive inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides validation of network modeling approaches for identifying important players in virus infection pathogenesis, and a step forward in understanding the host response to an important infectious disease. The results presented here suggest the role of Kepi in the host response to SARS-CoV, as well as inflammatory activity driving pathogenesis through TNFα signaling in SARS-CoV infections. Though we have reported the utility of this approach in bacterial and cell culture studies previously, this is the first comprehensive study to confirm that network topology can be used to predict phenotypes in mice with experimental validation.

615092,Co-infections in COVID-19 critically ill and antibiotic management: a prospective cohort analysis,2020-07-09,"INTRODUCTION: During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, mortality associated with the disease declined in the United States. The standard of care for pharmacological interventions evolved during this period as new and repurposed treatments were used alone and in combination. Though these medications have been studied individually, data are limited regarding the relative impact of different medication combinations. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the association of COVID-19-related mortality and observed medication combinations and to determine whether changes in medication-related practice patterns and measured patient characteristics, alone, explain the decline in mortality seen early in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a multi-hospital healthcare system exploring the association of mortality and combinations of remdesivir, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, tocilizumab, and hydroxychloroquine. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of mortality for both the overall population and the population stratified by intensive care and non-intensive care unit admissions. A separate model was created to control for the change in unmeasured variables over time. RESULTS: For all patients, four treatment combinations were associated with lower mortality: Anticoagulation Only (OR 0.24, p < 0.0001), Anticoagulation and Remdesivir (OR 0.25, p = 0.0031), Anticoagulation and Corticosteroids (OR 0.53, p = 0.0263), and Anticoagulation, Corticosteroids and Remdesivir (OR 0.42, p = 0.026). For non-intensive care unit patients, the same combinations were significantly associated with lower mortality. For patients admitted to the intensive care unit, Anticoagulation Only was the sole treatment category associated with decreased mortality. When adjusted for demographics, clinical characteristics, and all treatment combinations there was an absolute decrease in the mortality rate by 2.5% between early and late periods of the study. However, when including an additional control for changes in unmeasured variables overtime, the absolute mortality rate decreased by 5.4%. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that anticoagulation was the most significant treatment for the reduction of COVID-related mortality. Anticoagulation Only was the sole treatment category associated with a significant decrease in mortality for both intensive care and non-intensive care patients. Treatment combinations that additionally included corticosteroids and/or remdesivir were also associated with decreased mortality, though only in the non-intensive care stratum. Further, we found that factors other than measured changes in demographics, clinical characteristics or pharmacological interventions accounted for an additional decrease in the COVID-19-related mortality rate over time.","Coppock, Dagan; Baram, Michael; Chang, Anna Marie; Henwood, Patricia; Kubey, Alan; Summer, Ross; Zurlo, John; Li, Michael; Hess, Bryan",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34115801/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252591,81

We studied the impact of the pandemic and the national policy for pandemic control on the HD care delivery in Karnataka state in India in April 2020, when the first and second national lockdown were in place. An online, questionnaire based survey of dialysis facilities was conducted and the responses analysed. The questions were pertaining to the key areas such as changes in number of dialysis treatments, frequency, duration, expenses, transportation to and from dialysis units, impact on availability of consumables, effect on dialysis personnel and on machine maintenance. 62 centres participated. Median of dialysis treatments for the months of March and April 2020 were 695.5 and 650 respectively. Reduction in dialysis treatments was noted in 29(46.8%) facilities , decreased frequency reported by 60 centres. In at least 35(56.5%) centres, dialysis patients had to bear increased expenses.

Under a change in air quality from “Good” (Air Quality Index, or AQI, between 51 and 100) to “Heavily Polluted” (AQI between 201 to 300), the following effects are demonstrated. (i) Consistent with the literature, for every one million people, 1, 482 fewer individuals are observed at parks, 95% confidence interval or CI (−2, 229, −735), which represents a 15% decrease. (ii) The number of individuals at shopping malls has no statistically significant change. (iii) Home is the most important location under worsening air quality, and for every one million people, 63, 088 more individuals are observed at home, 95% CI (47, 815, 78, 361), which represents a 19% increase. (iv) Individuals are on average 633 meters closer to their home, 95% CI (529, 737); as a benchmark, the median distance from home ranges from 300 to 1900 meters across the cities in our sample. These effects are not due to weather or government regulations. We also provided provisional evidence that individuals engage in inter-temporal activity substitutions within a day, which leads to mitigated (but not nullified) effects of air pollution on daily activities.","Chen, Wei; He, YingHua; Pan, Shiyuan",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251288; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34010277/,81
623925,Camostat mesylate therapy in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia,2021-04-12,"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) typically presents with respiratory illness and fever, however some rare neurologic symptoms have been described as presenting complaints. We report a case of an acute motor and sensory polyneuropathy consistent with Miller-Fisher Syndrome (MFS) variant of Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) as the initial symptom. CASE REPORT: A 31-year old Spanish speaking male presents with two months of progressive weakness, numbness, and difficult walking. He had multiple cranial nerve abnormalities, dysmetria, ataxia, and absent lower extremity reflexes. An extensive workup including infectious, autoimmune, paraneoplastic, metabolic and neurologic testing was performed. Initially SARS-CoV-2 was not suspected based on a lack of respiratory symptoms. However, workup revealed a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test as well as presence of Anti-Ganglioside – GQ1b (Anti-GQ1b) immunoglobulin G antibodies. DISCUSSION: Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) is a variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) characterized by a triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. The patient’s exam and workup including Anti-GQ1b is consistent with MFS. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients can have atypical presentations similar to this neurologic presentation. Prompt recognition and diagnosis can minimize the risk of transmission to hospital staff and facilitate initiation of treatment.","Kopscik, Michael R.; Giourgas, Barbra K.; Presley, Bradley C.",Clin Pract Cases Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.5811/cpcem.2020.6.48683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32926684/,81

This study aimed to assess the feasibility, sustainability, and clinical outcomes of TVC for this patient population. METHODS: A total of 64 participants were recruited in this single-center, prospective, 2-year longitudinal, case-control study. Inclusion criteria for the telemedicine group included travel of ≥15 km to the hospital, and the control group was matched for transplant or CKD status, age, and sex. The primary outcome was feasibility (≥50% of consultations for each individual patient in the telemedicine group being conducted by TVC in year 1). Secondary outcomes were sustainability of telemedicine, change in blood pressure and creatinine, hospitalization, and travel distance. RESULTS: There were 32 participants in both the telemedicine and control arms, with no baseline differences. The majority were male (65.6%) and the mean age was 63.9 years (SD = 12.3 years). TVC uptake in year 1 in the telemedicine arm was 71% (interquartile range [IQR] = 50.0−100.0) but reduced significantly in year 2 (50.0% [IQR = 33.3−71.4], P < 0.01). No significant differences in creatinine or blood pressure were observed between groups, including in the KTRs and CKD subgroup analysis. Patient satisfaction remained high for both groups. Compared with travel distance required if TVC was unavailable, travel distance in the TVC group decreased by 48% (16,644 km) in year 1 and by 37.0% (8177 km) in year 2. CONCLUSION: TVC was feasible and sustainable, with outcomes comparable to those of standard care. Larger studies, especially among KTRs, are needed to confirm these findings.","Lambooy, Sebastiaan; Krishnasamy, Rathika; Pollock, Andrea; Hilder, Gerald; Gray, Nicholas A.",Kidney Int Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34013104/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ekir.2021.02.016,81
625430,Clinical Features and Outcomes of Very Elderly Patients Admitted to the Intensive Care Unit: A Retrospective and Observational Study,2021-06-11,"BACKGROUND: As the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) gears toward full regional integration by 2015, the cross-border mobility of workers and citizens at large is expected to further intensify in the coming years. While ASEAN member countries have already signed the Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers, the health rights of migrants still need to be addressed, especially with ongoing universal health coverage (UHC) reforms in most ASEAN countries. This paper seeks to examine the inclusion of migrants in the UHC systems of five ASEAN countries which exhibit diverse migration profiles and are currently undergoing varying stages of UHC development. DESIGN: A scoping review of current migration trends and policies as well as ongoing UHC developments and migrant inclusion in UHC in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand was conducted. RESULTS: In general, all five countries, whether receiving or sending, have schemes that cover migrants to varying extents. Thailand even allows undocumented migrants to opt into its Compulsory Migrant Health Insurance scheme, while Malaysia and Singapore are still yet to consider including migrants in their government-run UHC systems. In terms of predominantly sending countries, the Philippines's social health insurance provides outbound migrants with portable insurance yet with limited benefits, while Indonesia still needs to strengthen the implementation of its compulsory migrant insurance which has a health insurance component. Overall, the five ASEAN countries continue to face implementation challenges, and will need to improve on their UHC design in order to ensure genuine inclusion of migrants, including undocumented migrants. However, such reforms will require strong political decisions from agencies outside the health sector that govern migration and labor policies. Furthermore, countries must engage in multilateral and bilateral dialogue as they redefine UHC beyond the basis of citizenship and reimagine UHC systems that transcend national borders. CONCLUSIONS: By enhancing migrant coverage, ASEAN countries can make UHC systems truly ‘universal’. Migrant inclusion in UHC is a human rights imperative, and it is in ASEAN's best interest to protect the health of migrants as it pursues the path toward collective social progress and regional economic prosperity.","Guinto, Ramon Lorenzo Luis R.; Curran, Ufara Zuwasti; Suphanchaimat, Rapeepong; Pocock, Nicola S.",Glob Health Action,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25626624/; https://doi.org/10.3402/gha.v8.25749,81

All students responded to the pre- and post-training multiple-choice questionnaire on the basic knowledge of CPR, and, based on their responses, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to assess the comparability of effectiveness across learning modalities. (3) Results: Among the students, 49 (38.0%) students selected the YouTube video to learn about CPR and were treated as the intervention group. The mean pre-test scores and post-test scores of the YouTube and the instructor’s video groups were 6.43 and 6.64, and 9.06 and 9.09, respectively. After controlling for the pre-test score effects, the results of ANCOVA did not show statistically significant differences between groups (p = 0.927), indicating comparable performance between groups that used YouTube and the instructor’s videos. (4) Conclusion: Utilizing YouTube videos is a useful teaching strategy for teaching CPR knowledge, which would reduce the burden on faculty of creating screencast lecture videos for online learning on resuscitation.","Nomura, Osamu; Irie, Jin; Park, Yoonsoo; Nonogi, Hiroshi; Hanada, Hiroyuki",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18137113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34281050/,81

There is ongoing debate, however, whether surgical masks can meet the expectations of respiratory protection devices. The goal of this study was to evaluate the filter performance and facial fit of a sample of surgical masks. METHODS: Filter penetration was measured for at least 3 replicates of 9 surgical masks using monodisperse latex sphere aerosols (0.895, 2.0, and 3.1 μm) at 6 L/min and 0.075-μm sodium chloride particles at 84 L/min. Facial fit was measured on 20 subjects for the 5 masks with lowest particle penetration, using both qualitative and quantitative fit tests. RESULTS: Masks typically used in dental settings collected particles with significantly lower efficiency than those typically used in hospital settings. All subjects failed the unassisted qualitative fit test on the first exercise (normal breathing). Eighteen subjects failed the assisted qualitative fit tests; 60% failed on the first exercise. Quantitative fit factors ranged from 2.5 to 9.6.

SOC is a generalized orientation which allows one to perceive the world as comprehensible, manageable, and meaningful. In an attempt to understand ‘how does the SOC work’ we employed the salutogenic assumption that a strong SOC allows one to reach out in any given situation and find those resources appropriate to the specific stressor. Thus, we hypothesized that the positive impact of SOC on mental health outcomes would be mediated through coping resources that are particularly salient in times of crisis. One resource is related to the micro level (perceived family support) and the other concerns the macro level (trust in leaders and social-political institutions). Data collection was conducted in different countries during May–June 2020 via online platforms. The data included 7 samples of adult participants (age 18–90) from Israel (n ​= ​669), Italy (n ​= ​899), Spain (n ​= ​476), Germany (n ​= ​708), Austria (n ​= ​1026), Switzerland (n ​= ​147), and the U.S. (n ​= ​506). The questionnaires included standard tools (MHC-SF, SOC-13) as well as questionnaires of perceived family support and trust that were adapted to the pandemic context. As expected, SOC was associated with mental health in all the samples. Perceived family support and trust in leaders and social-political institutions mediated the relationships between SOC and mental health, controlling for age, gender, and level of financial risk. It appears that SOC has a universal meaning, not limited by cultural and situational characteristics. The discussion focuses on the theoretical, social, and political applications of the salutogenic model – and its core concept of SOC – in the context of coping with a global pandemic across different cultural contexts and countries.","Mana, A.; Bauer, G.F.; Meier Magistretti, C.; Sardu, C.; Juvinyà-Canal, D.; Hardy, L.J.; Catz, Or; Tušl, M.; Sagy, S.",SSM Ment Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666560321000013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666560321000013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34604824/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmmh.2021.100001,81

Therefore, we seek to explore how and why cyberloafing affects employee innovation performance. Based on the conservation of resources theory, our study explores the potential positive and negative effects of cyberloafing on employee innovation performance by identifying job anxiety, state gratitude and perceived meaning of work as critical mediating mechanisms in the COVID-19 pandemic. Results from an online survey (N = 544) during the COVID-19 pandemic showed that COVID-19 based informational cyberloafing was positively related to employees' innovation performance by enhancing their perceived meaning of work. It simultaneously weakened and strengthened employees’ perceived meaning of work through increased job anxiety and state gratitude, and ultimately had mixed effects on innovation performance.

However, observations are based on non-comparative retrospective studies. Evidence regarding vaccination in cancer pts is limited, but there is enough evidence to support COVID-19 vaccination, even under active treatment. Data on humoral and cellular immune response to antiviral vaccination in cancer pts are scarce. In pts receiving immunosuppressive therapies (IST) like chemotherapy and targeted therapies, seroconversion/protection rates are expected to be lower than general population, but not in pts receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Serum antibodies against an infectious agent may be an immunity indicator. Methods: Prospective observational longitudinal study with the intent of evaluating the humoral response of cancer pts to COVID-19 vaccination. The study includes pts diagnosed in any stage, without or under active treatment, or survivors followed in Hospital Prof. Dr. Fernando Fonseca, in partnership with Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência. Pts are divided into 4 arms, independently of the vaccine: A – IST;B – ICI;C –Hormone therapy (HT);D – Cancer survivors. Recruitment started in March 2021, expecting at least 50 pts per arm. IgG, IgA and IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies ELISA determination in 9 timepoints: before 1st dose and at the 3rd, 6th, 12th, 15th, 24th, 36th, 48th and 60th weeks post 1st dose. Side effects’ questionnaire will be implemented after 1st and 2nd doses. Results: Recruitment is ongoing and a total of 202 pts were enrolled, of which 178 pts have 3-weeks post 1st dose evaluated: 101 in arm A: 11 in B: 31 in C;and 35 in D.The mean age is 61.6 years, with 53.4% females. Regarding vaccines, 55 pts were submitted to ChAdOx1-S/nCoC-19, 5 to Ad26.COV2.S, 89 to BNT162b2 and 12 to mRNA-1273 vaccines. At 3 weeks, 33/97 pts (34%) in arm A, 2/11 pts (18%) in B, 14/28 pts (50%) in C and 15/35 pts (43%) in D already generated anti-spike IgG. Most common side effects were local inflammatory reaction (47%), generalized muscle pain (17%), fatigue (11%), and chills (10%).

Here, we report on the incidence of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients with IMD treated at a children’s hospital and compare them with a matched control group. Among the total number of 272 patients actively followed at a referral center, 19 (7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 2020 and March 2021. Their median age was 16.2 years (range 1.4–32.8 years). In two-thirds of the cases, the source of infection was a family member; 12/19 patients (63%) were asymptomatic, only one required hospitalization, and none of them died. In our single-center experience, COVID-19 had a moderate impact on a relatively large cohort of patients with IMD, including children and young adults. The clinical course was very mild in all but one case. The proportion of symptomatic cases and the clinical course were comparable in patients with IMD and in a group of matched, non-IMD COVID-19 controls from the general population.","Tummolo, Albina; Paterno, Giulia; Dicintio, Annamaria; Stefanizzi, Pasquale; Melpignano, Livio; Aricò, Maurizio",Children (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/children8090781; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34572213/,81

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, single-center study was done on 60 cases of probable CA-ROCM based on clinical features and supportive diagnostic nasal endoscopic findings and/or radiologic findings. Patients with recent or active COVID-19 were included. The demographic profile, clinical features, possible risk factors and diagnostic workup (microbiological, pathological and radiological) were analysed to identify the triggering factors for CA-ROCM. RESULTS: The age of patients ranged from 29 to 75 years and male–female ratio was 3:1. The duration between the first positive COVID report and onset of CA-ROCM was 0 to 47 days. Forty-nine (81.66%) patients had a recent COVID infection and 11 (18.33%) had active COVID infection at presentation. Thirty-five patients (58%) had ocular/orbital involvement at presentation. In the affected eye, 10 had no perception of light and in the rest visual acuity ranged from log MAR 0 to +1.5. Ocular manifestations were ptosis (29), ophthalmoplegia (23), periocular tenderness and edema (33), proptosis (14), black discoloration of eyelids (3), facial palsy (3), endophthalmitis (4), retinal artery occlusion (8), disc edema (4) and disc pallor (5). Twenty-two (25%) patients had neither received steroids nor oxygen. Thirty patients (50%) were managed with oxygen while 38 patients (63.3%) with systemic steroids. The most common risk factor was diabetes in 59 patients. The average glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 10.31 ± 2.59%. Systemic Amphotericin B was started in all the patients. Radical surgical debridement was performed in 12 patients and the remaining were planned.

HSV-1 encodes seven proteins to replicate its genome in the hijacked human cell. Among these are the herpes virus DNA helicase and primase that are essential components of its replication machinery. In the HSV-1 replisome, the helicase–primase complex is composed of three components including UL5 (helicase), UL52 (primase) and UL8 (non-catalytic subunit). UL5 and UL52 subunits are functionally interdependent, and the UL8 component is required for the coordination of UL5 and UL52 activities proceeding in opposite directions with respect to the viral replication fork. Anti-viral compounds currently under development target the functions of UL5 and UL52. Here, we review the structural and functional properties of the UL5/UL8/UL52 complex and highlight the gaps in knowledge to be filled to facilitate molecular characterization of the structure and function of the helicase–primase complex for development of alternative anti-viral treatments.","Bermek, Oya; Williams, R.

Moreover, it can influence family dynamics and function in other ways, and unfortunately, it can also be associated with mortality, particularly in the inner-city environments of the United States. Thus understanding factors that lead to its development in early life is essential in developing strategies aimed at primary prevention. Two risk factors that have been identified by a number of investigators include the development of allergic sensitization and wheezing respiratory tract illnesses caused by viruses and bacteria, either alone or in combination. Both of these factors appear to exert their influences within the first few years of life, such that asthma becomes established before the child enters grade school at age 5 to 6 years. Therefore, because both allergic sensitization and viral and bacterial illnesses can occur in children who do not have asthma, it is paramount to identify genetic and environmental factors that activate, interact with, and/or direct the immune system and components of the respiratory tract along pathways that allow asthma to become established and expressed clinically.","Jackson, Daniel J.; Gern, James E.; Lemanske, Robert F.",Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2016.01.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26947979/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674916001068; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674916001068,81

The present study developed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) to complement the clinical efforts in preventing the spread and treating of COVID-19 cases. METHODS: The sample comprised 717 Iranian participants. The items of the FCV-19S were constructed based on extensive review of existing scales on fears, expert evaluations, and participant interviews. Several psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain its reliability and validity properties. RESULTS: After panel review and corrected item-total correlation testing, seven items with acceptable corrected item-total correlation (0.47 to 0.56) were retained and further confirmed by significant and strong factor loadings (0.66 to 0.74). Also, other properties evaluated using both classical test theory and Rasch model were satisfactory on the seven-item scale. More specifically, reliability values such as internal consistency (α = .82) and test–retest reliability (ICC = .72) were acceptable. Concurrent validity was supported by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (with depression, r = 0.425 and anxiety, r = 0.511) and the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (with perceived infectability, r = 0.483 and germ aversion, r = 0.459). CONCLUSION: The Fear of COVID-19 Scale, a seven-item scale, has robust psychometric properties. It is reliable and valid in assessing fear of COVID-19 among the general population and will also be useful in allaying COVID-19 fears among individuals.","Ahorsu, Daniel Kwasi; Lin, Chung-Ying; Imani, Vida; Saffari, Mohsen; Griffiths, Mark D.; Pakpour, Amir H.",Int J Ment Health Addict,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00270-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226353/,81

Dolphin-Assisted Therapy (DAT) has also become a topic of public and research interest for these disorders’ intervention and treatment. This work exposes the development of a system that controls brain–computer interaction when a patient with different abilities undergoes a DAT. To develop the proposed system, TGAM1, i.e., ThinkGear-AM1 series of NeuroSky company, was used, connecting it to an isolated Bluetooth 4.0 communication protocol from a brackish and humid environment, and a Notch Filter was applied to reduce the input noise. In this way, at Definiti Ixtapa-Mexico facilities, we explored the behavior of three children with Infantile Spastic Cerebral Palsy (Experiment 1), as well as the behavior of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and neurotypic children (Experiment 2). This was done applying the Power Spectrum Density (PSD) and the Self-Affine Analysis (SSA) from Electroencephalogram (EEG) biosignals. The EEG Raw data were time series showing the cerebral brain activity (voltage versus time) before and during DAT for the Experiment 1, and before, during DAT and after for the Experiment 2. Likewise, the EEW RAW data were recorded by the first frontopolar electrode (FP1) by means of an EEG biosensor TGAM1 Module. From the PSD we found that in all child patients a huge increment of brain activity during DAT regarding the before and after therapy periods around 376.28%. Moreover, from the SSA we found that the structure function of the all five child patients displayed an antipersistent behavior, characterized by [Formula: see text] , for before, during DAT and after. Nonetheless, we propose that one way to assess whether a DAT is being efficient to the child patients is to increase the during DAT time when the samples are collected, supposing the data fitting by a power law will raise the time, displaying a persistent behavior or positive correlations, until a crossover appears and the curve tends to be horizontal, pointing out that our system has reached a stationary state.","Matamoros, Oswaldo Morales; Escobar, Jesús Jaime Moreno; Tejeida Padilla, Ricardo; Lina Reyes, Ixchel",Brain Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci10060403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32630512/,81

The present research investigated the associations between social media exposure and depression during the COVID-19 outbreak by examining the mediating role of psychological distress and the moderating role of emotion regulation among members of the general public in China. Participants (N = 485) completed a set of questionnaires online, including demographic information, self-rated physical health, and social media exposure to topics related to COVID-19. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) were utilized to measure psychological distress about COVID-19, depression, and emotion regulation strategies, respectively. Results found that older age and greater levels of social media exposure were associated with more psychological distress about the virus (r = 0.14, p = 0.003; r = 0.22, p < 0.001). Results of the moderated mediation model suggest that psychological distress mediated the relationship between social media exposure and depression (β = 0.10; Boot 95% CI = 0.07, 0.15). Furthermore, expressive suppression moderated the relationship between psychological distress and depression (β = 0.10, p = 0.017). The findings are discussed in terms of the need for mental health assistance for individuals at high risk of depression, including the elderly and individuals who reported greater psychological distress and those who showed preference usage of suppression, during the COVID-19 crisis.","Zhang, Yu-ting; Li, Rui-ting; Sun, Xiao-jun; Peng, Ming; Li, Xu",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34054602/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.644899,81

We aimed to develop and validate a novel reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in both qualified laboratories and point-of-care settings. Methods Patients with suspected COVID-19 and close contacts between Jan 26 and April 8, 2020, were recruited from two hospitals. Respiratory samples were collected and tested with LAMP and the results were compared with those obtained by RT-qPCR. The inconsistent samples between these two methods were subjected to next-generation sequencing for confirmation. In addition, we tested the RT-LAMP on an asymptomatic COVID-19 carrier and patients with other respiratory viral infections. Results We finally collected a cohort of 129 cases (329 nasopharyngeal swabs) and the independent cohort of 76 patients (152 nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples). RT-LAMP was validated to be accurate (overall sensitivity and specificity: 88.89% and 99.00%; positive and negative predictive values: 94.74% and 97.78%) and diagnostically useful (positive and negative likelihood ratios: 88.89 and 0.11). RT-LAMP showed an increased sensitivity (88.89% vs 81.48%) and high consistency (kappa 0.92) compared with RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 screening while requiring only constant temperature heating and visual inspection. The median time required for RT-LAMP was less than 1 h from sample to result. Further analyses indicated that RT-LAMP was feasible for asymptomatic patients and did not cross-react with other respiratory pathogen infections. Conclusion The RT-LAMP assay offers a rapid, sensitive and straightforward detection for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could aid the expansion of COVID-19 testing in the public domain and hospitals.","Hu, X.; Deng, Q.; Li, J.; Chen, J.; Wang, Z.; Fang, Z.; Li, H.; Zhao, Y.; Yu, P.; Li, W.; Wang, X.; Li, S.; Zhang, L.; Hou, T.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.20108530; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.20.20108530v1?rss=1,81

The main protease (M(pro)) enzyme produced by SARS-CoV-2 was recently demonstrated to be responsible for not only viral reproduction but also impeding host immune responses. The element selenium (Se) plays a vital role in immune functions, both directly and indirectly. Thus, we hypothesised that Se-containing heterocyclic compounds might curb the activity of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). We performed a molecular docking analysis and found that several of the selected selenocompounds showed potential binding affinities for SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), especially ethaselen (49), which exhibited a docking score of −6.7 kcal/mol compared with the −6.5 kcal/mol score for GC376 (positive control). Drug-likeness calculations suggested that these compounds are biologically active and possess the characteristics of ideal drug candidates. Based on the binding affinity and drug-likeness results, we selected the 16 most effective selenocompounds as potential anti-COVID-19 drug candidates. We also validated the structural integrity and stability of the drug candidate through molecular dynamics simulation. Using further in vitro and in vivo experiments, we believe that the targeted compound identified in this study (ethaselen) could pave the way for the development of prospective drugs to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections and trigger specific host immune responses.","Rakib, Ahmed; Nain, Zulkar; Sami, Saad Ahmed; Mahmud, Shafi; Islam, Ashiqul; Ahmed, Shahriar; Siddiqui, Adnan Bin Faisul; Babu, S M Omar Faruque; Hossain, Payar; Shahriar, Asif; Nainu, Firzan; Emran, Talha Bin; Simal-Gandara, Jesus",Brief Bioinform,https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbab045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33623995/,81

Attempts to resolve these complexities have led to the proposal of a variety of trial designs, including individual randomization and several types of cluster randomization designs: parallel-arm, ring vaccination, and stepped wedge designs. Because of the strong time trends present in infectious disease incidence, however, methods generally used to analyze stepped wedge trials may not perform well in these settings. Using simulated outbreaks, we evaluate various designs and analysis methods, including recently proposed methods for analyzing stepped wedge trials, to determine the statistical properties of these methods. While new methods for analyzing stepped wedge trials can provide some improvement over previous methods, we find that they still lag behind parallel-arm cluster-randomized trials and individually-randomized trials in achieving adequate power to detect intervention effects. We also find that these methods are highly sensitive to the weighting of effect estimates across time periods.

Here, we compared the antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of a family of peptides obtained from sequence permutation of WW291. The resulting eight WW peptides (WW291-WW298) gained different activities against a panel of bacteria. While WW295 inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli, WW298 was highly active against S. aureus USA300 LAC. Consistently with this, WW298 was more effective in permeating or depolarizing the S. aureus membranes, whereas WW295 potently permeated the E. coli membranes. In addition, WW298, but not WW295, inhibited the MRSA attachment and could disrupt its preformed biofilms more effectively than daptomycin. WW298 also protected wax moths Galleria mellonella from MRSA infection causing death.

Our findings suggest that the effective reproduction number decreased drastically in contrast with the value of 3.6 on April 9; after that the effective interventions were implemented by the Heilongjiang province government. Finally, the effective reproduction number arrived at the value of 0.04 which is immensely below the threshold value 1, which means that the Heilongjiang province government got the outbreak of COVID-19 in Harbin under control.","Song, Haitao; Jia, Zhongwei; Jin, Zhen; Liu, Shengqiang",Nonlinear Dyn,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11071-021-06406-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33867676/,81
677243,High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) for patients with Covid-19 outside intensive care units,2021-07-28,"Symptoms associated with lung cancer mainly consist of cancer-associated pain, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea. However, underlying mechanisms of lung cancer symptom clusters remain unclear. There remains a paucity of effective treatment to ameliorate debilitating symptoms and improve the quality of life of lung cancer survivors. Recently, extracellular ATP and its receptors have attracted increasing attention among researchers in the field of oncology. Extracellular ATP in the tumor microenvironment is associated with tumor cell metabolism, proliferation, and metastasis by driving inflammation and neurotransmission via P2 purinergic signaling. Accordingly, ATP gated P2X receptors expressed on tumor cells, immune cells, and neurons play a vital role in modulating tumor development, invasion, progression, and related symptoms. P2 purinergic signaling is involved in the development of different lung cancer-related symptoms. In this review, we summarize recent findings to illustrate the role of P2X receptors in tumor proliferation, progression, metastasis, and lung cancer- related symptoms, providing an outline of potential anti-neoplastic activity of P2X receptor antagonists. Furthermore, compared with opioids, P2X receptor antagonists appear to be innovative therapeutic interventions for managing cancer symptom clusters with fewer side effects.","Mai, Yonglin; Guo, Zhihua; Yin, Weiqiang; Zhong, Nanshan; Dicpinigaitis, Peter V.; Chen, Ruchong",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34268121/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.691956,81

679008,Rate of Intensive Care Unit admission and outcomes among patients with coronavirus: A systematic review and Meta-analysis,2020-07-10,"Background. COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, can involve sequelae and other medical complications that last weeks to months after initial recovery, which has come to be called Long-COVID or COVID long-haulers. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to identify studies assessing long-term effects of COVID-19 and estimates the prevalence of each symptom, sign, or laboratory parameter of patients at a post-COVID-19 stage. Methods . LitCOVID (PubMed and Medline) and Embase were searched by two independent researchers. All articles with original data for detecting long-term COVID-19 published before 1 (st) of January 2021 and with a minimum of 100 patients were included. For effects reported in two or more studies, meta-analyses using a random-effects model were performed using the MetaXL software to estimate the pooled prevalence with 95% CI. Heterogeneity was assessed using I (2) statistics. This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviewers and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, although the study protocol was not registered. Results. A total of 18,251 publications were identified, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of 55 long-term effects was estimated, 21 meta-analyses were performed, and 47,910 patients were included. The follow-up time ranged from 14 to 110 days post-viral infection. The age of the study participants ranged between 17 and 87 years. It was estimated that 80% (95% CI 65-92) of the patients that were infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed one or more long-term symptoms. The five most common symptoms were fatigue (58%), headache (44%), attention disorder (27%), hair loss (25%), and dyspnea (24%). All meta-analyses showed medium (n=2) to high heterogeneity (n=13). Conclusions . In order to have a better understanding, future studies need to stratify by sex, age, previous comorbidities, the severity of COVID-19 (ranging from asymptomatic to severe), and duration of each symptom. From the clinical perspective, multi-disciplinary teams are crucial to developing preventive measures, rehabilitation techniques, and clinical management strategies with whole-patient perspectives designed to address long COVID-19 care.","Lopez-Leon, Sandra; Wegman-Ostrosky, Talia; Perelman, Carol; Sepulveda, Rosalinda; Rebolledo, Paulina; Cuapio, Angelica; Villapol, Sonia",Res Sq,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-266574/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33688642/,81

This study is part of an effort by Ministry of Health (MoH) and World Health Organization (WHO) to evaluate the improvement in the MHPSS following capacity strengthening of social and health providers. METHODS: 357 Syrians under temporary protection were interviewed as they exited the Refugee Health Training Centers in 7 provinces in Turkey (Adana, Gaziantep, Hatay, Istanbul, Izmir and Sanliurfa), using patient exit interviews during mid-Oct – mid-Nov 2019. Uni and bivariate analysis for association was done using Chi square test for categorical variables, looking for significance at p < 0.05. Multivariate analysis (logistic regression) was used to determine the profile of service users and the predictors of satisfaction with MHPSS. RESULTS: Overall satisfaction with services was 93%. The profile of the MHPSS user suggests that the odds of using the service are twice as much for people aged 40+ years (OR 2.016, CI95% [1.129–3.601]), and five times less for married women (OR 0.180, CI95% [0.083–0.391]). The service characteristics that can predict service satisfaction are “having the needs met” (OR 138.73, CI95% [27.99–687.54]) and “satisfaction with the length of the appointments” (OR 54.50, CI95% [6.07–489.57]). There was no multicollinearity detected between the predictors. CONCLUSIONS: MHPSS services provided by professionals trained by MoH and WHO, have a high satisfaction rate and are serving the SuTP population in need. The high satisfaction rate is predicted by having MHPSS needs met, which is a key indication of the usefulness of these services.","Kahilogullari, Akfer Karaoglan; Alatas, Esra; Ertugrul, Fatmagul; Malaj, Altin",J Migr Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34405173/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmh.2020.100022,81
684591,Prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among people influenced by coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak: A meta-analysis,2021-04-12,"Background: The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in social distancing and isolation which leads to insufficient physical activity and thereby increases sedentary behaviors. Hence, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of insufficient physical activity and sedentary behaviors among medical students during the COVID-19 lockdown in Pakistan, and to determine their associated factors. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was carried out among 407 medical students from the Punjab and Sindh provinces between May and June 2020. To collect data, an e-questionnaire was sent to obtain informed consent along with questions concerning socio-demographics as well as an International Physical Activity Questionnaires–Short Form (IPAQ–SF). Results: As per the IPAQ, almost five in ten participants were physically inactive (48.2%), and 45.2% reported sedentary behaviors. Participants with insufficient physical activity were more likely to report sedentary behaviors than their counterparts (AOR = 2.53; 95% CI = 1.66–3.85, p < 0.001). The odds of insufficient physical activity were higher among the participants who did not strictly follow the COVID-19 preventive measures (AOR = 2.51; 95% CI = 1.35–4.69, p = 0.004); similarly, there were increased odds of sedentary behaviors observed among participants within a normal weight range compared to those who were underweight (AOR = 2.69; 95% CI = 1.76–4.11, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Insufficient physical activity and sedentary behavior are prevalent among medical students in Pakistan during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings indicate the importance of establishing tailored policies and programs to encourage young adults to engage in physical activity.","Ullah, Irfan; Islam, Md.

686624,COVID-19 Pandemic—What Should Not Be Forgotten,2021-04-20,"Drugs against flaviviruses such as dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) virus are urgently needed. We previously demonstrated that three fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, and difloxacin, suppress replication of six flaviviruses. To investigate the barrier to resistance and mechanism(s) of action of these drugs, DENV-4 was passaged in triplicate in HEK-293 cells in the presence or absence of each drug. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was detected by the seventh passage and to difloxacin by the tenth, whereas resistance to enoxacin did not occur within ten passages. Two putative resistance-conferring mutations were detected in the envelope gene of ciprofloxacin and difloxacin-resistant DENV-4. In the absence of ciprofloxacin, ciprofloxacin-resistant viruses sustained a significantly higher viral titer than control viruses in HEK-293 and HuH-7 cells and resistant viruses were more stable than control viruses at 37 °C. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of ciprofloxacin and difloxacin involves interference with virus binding or entry.","Scroggs, Stacey L.P.; Gass, Jordan T.; Chinnasamy, Ramesh; Widen, Steven G.; Azar, Sasha R.; Rossi, Shannan L.; Arterburn, Jeffrey B.; Vasilakis, Nikos; Hanley, Kathryn A.",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682220301884; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2020.09.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682220301884?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33120225/,81
