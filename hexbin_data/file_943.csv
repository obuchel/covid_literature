The active Caspase-6 is localized in neuritic plaques, in neuropil threads, and in neurofibrillary tangles containing neurons that are not morphologically apoptotic in nature. To investigate the potential consequences of the activation of Caspase-6 in neurons, we conducted a proteomics analysis of Caspase-6-mediated cleavage of human neuronal proteins. Proteins from the cytosolic and membrane subcellular compartments were treated with recombinant active Caspase-6 and compared with undigested proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. LC/MS/MS analyses of the proteins that were cleaved identified 24 different potential protein substrates. Of these, 40% were cytoskeleton or cytoskeleton-associated proteins. We focused on the cytoskeleton proteins because these are critical for neuronal structure and function. Caspase-6 cleavage of alpha-Tubulin, alpha-Actinin-4, Spinophilin, and Drebrin was confirmed. At least one Caspase-6 cleavage site was identified for Drebrin, Spinophilin, and alpha-Tubulin. A neoepitope antiserum to alpha-Tubulin cleaved by Caspase-6 immunostained neurons, neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, and neuritic plaques in Alzheimer disease and co-localized with active Caspase-6. These results imply that the early and neuritic activation of Caspase-6 in Alzheimer disease could disrupt the cytoskeleton network of neurons, resulting in impaired neuronal structure and function in the absence of cell death. This study provides novel insights into the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease.","Klaiman, Guy; Petzke, Tracy L; Hammond, Jennifer; Leblanc, Andréa C",Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,943,1

METHODS: Participant-level age-corrected NIHTB-CB data were extracted from six studies in individuals with a history of stroke, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), treatment-resistant psychosis, and healthy controls, with testing administered under standard conditions. Prorated fluid and total cognition scores were estimated using regression equations that excluded the three fluid cognition NIHTB-CB instruments which cannot be administered remotely. Paired t tests and intraclass correlations (ICCs) were used to compare the standard and prorated scores. RESULTS: Data were available for 245 participants. For fluid cognition, overall prorated scores were higher than standard scores (mean difference = +4.5, SD = 14.3; p < 0.001; ICC = 0.86). For total cognition, overall prorated scores were higher than standard scores (mean difference = +2.7, SD = 8.3; p < 0.001; ICC = 0.88). These differences were significant in the stroke and mTBI groups, but not in the healthy control or psychosis groups. CONCLUSIONS: Prorated scores from an abbreviated NIHTB-CB protocol are not a valid replacement for the scores from the standard protocol. Alternative approaches to administering the full protocol, or corrections to scoring of the abbreviated protocol, require further study and validation.","Rebchuk, Alexander D; Alimohammadi, Arshia; Yuan, Michelle; Cairncross, Molly; Torres, Ivan J; Silverberg, Noah D; Field, Thalia S",J Int Neuropsychol Soc,943,31

The first wave of the pandemic hit a lot of countries hard and many patients died. Not enough specialized equipment and limited knowledge of the disease added to the severity of this first phase. We all learned from our mistakes made during this first wave of the pandemic and due to that the confidence to be able to manage the second wave a lot better was high. Nevertheless, much higher infection numbers, more patients in ICUs and in some countries also more deaths were seen during the second wave. In this editorial we will describe the differences between the first and second wave from a European-German perspective and look at the impact it had on different parts of our lives. In general, some shortcomings were relatively easy to prevent from happening again. Basic equipment such as face masks, FFP2 masks and disinfectant is not an issue anymore. The respective political systems have solved that problem. Some countries also have learned from the first wave that prevention is the only option to reduce patient numbers hitting the hospitals and especially the ICUs. Due to those facts, most of the European countries now thought they could deal with higher infection numbers. This, however, was an erroneous belief. Theoretical constructs such as a ""Lockdown light"" have failed to prove successful. Finally, only a hard Lockdown can bring down numbers sufficiently. In Hospitals, the experience from the first wave helped to treat patients more effectively, leading to an improved infection number/death ratio. However, the political decision to react slow and sometimes only in increments and not with full force led to a huge increase in patient numbers and consecutively soaring numbers of cases needing treatment in hospitals and ICUs. While some countries managed this second wave a lot better than the first, Germany for example did not. Meanwhile more than 20 000 deaths compared to less than 10 000 in the entire first wave is a sure indication and it was certainly not caused by the medical performance in Hospitals being poorer the second time around. For Orthopaedic surgeons, the second wave led to the same restrictions as the first one. Again, they became part of the interdisciplinary COVID-19 teams on the wards and again, the numbers of elective surgeries plummeted dramatically. Financial consequences will remain throughout 2021. The second wave was a hard test for society, particularly as it hit its peak around Christmas time. Contact restrictions, closed hotels, forbidden fireworks at New Year all that is a challenge in particular for the younger people in the societies. All those restrictions, however, can never be an excuse for people delivering abstruse theories via social media or during demonstrations. Scientists all over the world deliver reliable information, these are the people to trust - they are the only experts. Some of them also successfully developed what we all hoped for - a vaccine. Although vaccination started some days back, it will take at least until autumn 2021 to have our normal lives back. Hopefully we all learned a lesson.","Graichen, Heiko",,943,16

As of 17 April 2020, more than 2 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide. Northern Italy is one of the world’s centers of active coronavirus cases. In this study, we predicted the spread of COVID-19 and its burden on hospital care under different conditions of social distancing in Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna, the two regions of Italy most affected by the epidemic. To do this, we used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) deterministic model, which encompasses compartments relevant to public health interventions such as quarantine. A new compartment L was added to the model for isolated infected population, i.e., individuals tested positives that do not need hospital care. We found that in Lombardy restrictive containment measures should be prolonged at least until early July to avoid a resurgence of hospitalizations; on the other hand, in Emilia-Romagna the number of hospitalized cases could be kept under a reasonable amount with a higher contact rate. Our results suggest that territory-specific forecasts under different scenarios are crucial to enhance or take new containment measures during the epidemic.","Reno, Chiara; Lenzi, Jacopo; Navarra, Antonio; Barelli, Eleonora; Gori, Davide; Lanza, Alessandro; Valentini, Riccardo; Tang, Biao; Fantini, Maria Pia",J.

The entire scientific community across the globe is working diligently to tackle this unprecedented challenge. In silico studies have played a crucial role in the current situation by expediting the process of identification of novel potential chemotypes targeting the viral receptors. In this study, we have made efforts to identify molecules that can potentially inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) using the high-resolution crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro has a large flexible binding pocket that can accommodate various chemically diverse ligands but a complete occupation of the binding cavity is necessary for efficient inhibition and stability. We augmented glide three-tier molecular docking protocol with water thermodynamics to screen molecules obtained from three different compound libraries. The diverse hits obtained through docking studies were scored against generated WaterMap to enrich the quality of results. Five molecules were selected from each compound library on the basis of scores and protein-ligand complementarity. Further MD simulations on the proposed molecules affirm the stability of these molecules in the complex. MM-GBSA results and intermolecular hydrogen bond analysis also confirm the thermodynamic stability of proposed molecules.

Because race and ethnicity are missing for a proportion of reported COVID-19 cases, counties with substantial missing information often are excluded from analyses of disparities (4). Thus, as a complement to these case-based analyses, population-based studies can help direct public health interventions. Using data from the 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC), CDC identified counties where five racial and ethnic minority groups (Hispanic or Latino [Hispanic], non-Hispanic Black or African American [Black], non-Hispanic Asian [Asian], non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native [AI/AN], and non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander [NH/PI]) might have experienced high COVID-19 impact during April 1-December 22, 2020. These counties had high 2-week COVID-19 incidences (>100 new cases per 100,000 persons in the total population) and percentages of persons in five racial and ethnic groups that were larger than the national percentages (denoted as ""large"").

The findings of this population-based analysis complement those of case-based analyses. In jurisdictions with substantial missing race and ethnicity information, this method could be applied to smaller geographic areas, to identify communities of color that might be experiencing high potential COVID-19 impact.

Cuts to essential services, coupled with a growing homeless population, create a challenging environment to tackle this public health crisis. In this paper, we highlight an underexplored environmental constraint faced by people living and injecting drugs on the streets. Access to water for injection is restricted in the UK, due to legislative and financial barriers. Austerity measures, such as public toilet closures, further restrict the ability of people made homeless to access clean water and protect themselves from health harms. METHODS: We generated questionnaire (n = 455) and in-depth qualitative interview (n = 32) data with people who inject drugs in London for the Care and Prevent study. Participants provided detail on their life history; drug use, injecting and living environments; health conditions and care seeking practices. FINDINGS: A high proportion of the survey sample reported lifetime history of street homelessness (78%), bacterial infections (65%) and related hospitalisation (30%). Qualitative accounts highlight unsafe, potentially dangerous, injection practices in semi-public spaces. Multiple constraints to sourcing sterile water for injection preparation were reported. Alternatives to sterile water included puddle water, toilet cistern water, whisky, cola soda and saliva. Participants who injected heroin and crack cocaine together unanimously reported adding water at two stages during injection preparation: first, adding water as a vehicle for heroin (which was then heated); second, adding cold water to the heroin mixture prior to adding the crack cocaine. This new finding of a stage addition of solvent may represent an additional risk of infection. CONCLUSION: Currently, harm reduction equipment and resources for safe injecting are not meeting the needs of people who inject drugs who are street homeless or unstably housed. Preparation of injections with non-sterile water sources could precipitate bacterial and fungal infections, particularly when used without the application of heat. It is crucial that water for injection, also skin cleaning, is made available for the unstably housed and that harm reduction messaging is tailored to speak to the everyday realities of people who prepare and inject drugs in public spaces.","Harris, Magdalena; Scott, Jenny; Hope, Vivian; Wright, Talen; McGowan, Catherine; Ciccarone, Daniel",Harm Reduct J,943,33
