At each market, samples were collected from up to 27 poultry-related sites to assess the extent of contamination. Samples were tested by using real-time reverse transcription–PCR and virus isolation. A questionnaire was used to ascertain types of birds in the market, general infrastructure, and work practices. Thirty-nine (47%) markets showed contamination with avian influenza virus in >1 of the sites sampled. Risk factors were slaughtering birds in the market and being located in West Java province. Protective factors included daily removal of waste and zoning that segregated poultry-related work flow areas. These results can aid in the design of evidence-based programs concerning environmental sanitation, food safety, and surveillance to reduce the risk for avian influenza virus A (H5N1) transmission in live-bird markets.","Indriani, Risa; Samaan, Gina; Gultom, Anita; Loth, Leo; Indryani, Sri; Adjid, Rma; Dharmayanti, Ni Luh Putu Indi; Weaver, John; Mumford, Elizabeth; Lokuge, Kamalini; Kelly, Paul M.",Emerg Infect Dis,555,3

Based on this technology, we synthesized DNA templates, which were transcribed into sgRNA in vitro, and further detected their efficiency of purified sgRNAs with Cas9 nuclease. The sgRNAs synthesized by this approach can effectively cleave the DNA fragments of interest in vitro and in vivo. Compared with the conventional method for generating sgRNA, it does not require construction of recombinant plasmids and design of primers to amplify sgRNA core fragment. Only several short primers with overlapped sequences are needed to assemble a DNA fragment as the template of sgRNA. This modified and simplified method is highly applicable and less time-consuming.","Hu, Zheng; Wang, Li; Shi, Zhaoying; Jiang, Jing; Li, Xiangning; Chen, Yonglong; Li, Kai; Luo, Dixian",Cell Biosci,555,8

The diagnostic value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), an emerging powerful platform, remains to be studied in CNS infections. METHODS: We conducted a single-center prospective cohort study to compare mNGS with conventional methods including culture, smear and etc. 248 suspected CNS infectious patients were enrolled and clinical data were recorded. RESULTS: mNGS reported a 90.00% (9/10) sensitivity in culture-positive patients without empirical treatment and 66.67% (6/9) in empirically-treated patients. Detected an extra of 48 bacteria and fungi in culture-negative patients, mNGS provided a higher detection rate compared to culture in patients with (34.45% vs. 7.56%, McNemar test, p < 0.0083) or without empirical therapy (50.00% vs. 25.00%, McNemar test, p > 0.0083). Compared to conventional methods, positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement was 75.00% and 69.11% separately. mNGS detection rate was significantly higher in patients with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) WBC > 300 * 10(6)/L, CSF protein > 500 mg/L or glucose ratio ≤ 0.3. mNGS sequencing read is correlated with CSF WBC, glucose ratio levels and clinical disease progression. CONCLUSION: mNGS showed a satisfying diagnostic performance in CNS infections and had an overall superior detection rate to culture. mNGS may held diagnostic advantages especially in empirically treated patients. CSF laboratory results were statistically relevant to mNGS detection rate, and mNGS could dynamically monitor disease progression.","Zhang, Yi; Cui, Peng; Zhang, Hao-Cheng; Wu, Hong-Long; Ye, Ming-Zhi; Zhu, Yi-Min; Ai, Jing-Wen; Zhang, Wen-Hong",J Transl Med,555,8

METHODS: We retrospectively examined the records of ESCC patients who were judged to be ycN-RLN(-) following nCRT. Patients were divided into two groups according to the extent of LND [standard two-field LND (STL group) versus total two-field LND (TTL group)]. Only lower mediastinal and upper abdominal lymph nodes were removed in the STL group. In addition to the standard procedure, patients in the TTL group underwent resection of upper mediastinal lymph nodes located along the bilateral RLN. Using propensity score matching, 29 pairs were identified and compared with regard to perioperative complications, lymph-node metastases rates, overall survival (OS), and disease-specific survival (DSS). RESULTS: No significant intergroup differences were identified in terms of in-hospital mortality and morbidity. Metastases to the RLN lymph nodes were identified in 20.7% (6/29) of TTL patients, being the only site of lymph-node metastases in three of them. TTL was associated with lower upper mediastinal lymph-node recurrence rate (6.5%) compared with STL (21.5%, p = 0.134), although the overall recurrence rate was similar (STL, 44.8% versus TTL, 46.4%). No significant intergroup differences were also evident with regard to 3-year DSS and OS rates. CONCLUSIONS: RLN LND can be safely performed in ESCC patients who had undergone nCRT, ultimately resulting in an improved local control, and should be practiced as part of the surgical routine.

Macrophages and T-lymphocytes infiltrate muscles in response to damage-associated molecular pattern signalling and the release of TNF-α, TGF-β and interleukins prevent skeletal muscle improvement from the inflammation. This immunological scenario was extended by the discovery of a specific response to muscle antigens and a role for regulatory T cells (Tregs) in muscle regeneration. Normally, autoimmunity is avoided by autoreactive T-lymphocyte deletion within thymus, while in the periphery Tregs monitor effector T-cells escaping from central regulatory control. Here, we report impairment of thymus architecture of mdx mice together with decreased expression of ghrelin, autophagy dysfunction and AIRE down-regulation. Transplantation of dystrophic thymus in recipient nude mice determine the up-regulation of inflammatory/fibrotic markers, marked metabolic breakdown that leads to muscle atrophy and loss of force. These results indicate that involution of dystrophic thymus exacerbates muscular dystrophy by altering central immune tolerance.","Farini, Andrea; Sitzia, Clementina; Villa, Chiara; Cassani, Barbara; Tripodi, Luana; Legato, Mariella; Belicchi, Marzia; Bella, Pamela; Lonati, Caterina; Gatti, Stefano; Cerletti, Massimiliano; Torrente, Yvan",Nat Commun,555,8

As for law-making, this article explores the evolving substance of international investment agreements as well as regulatory developments in the area of business and human rights that are of relevance to the international investment law framework. The article then turns to consider the emergence of human rights and environmental issues in the recent jurisprudence of investment tribunals and appraises how such issues have been dealt with—both in procedural and substantive terms—by arbitral tribunals. Finally, it questions whether investment tribunals are appropriate venues for the adjudication of non-investment matters like environmental and human rights issues, and highlights best practices that could be adopted by future tribunals. Overall, the article concludes that the piecemeal approach adopted to date provides a step in the right direction but is ultimately inadequate given the multiple challenges that our planet currently faces. Rather, a more ambitious agenda that is concerned with promoting good investment, as opposed to mitigating bad practices, should be pursued.","Rudall, Jason",Neth Int Law Rev,555,4

We present a single center study of COVID-19 pneumonia in a cohort of 31 patients with HM. METHODS: Data were abstracted from electronic medical records for patients admitted to NYPH between 3/5/20 and 4/17/20 and entered into a REDCap database. RESULTS: Twenty (64.5%) were male; median age was 71 years. There were 8 patients with Multiple Myeloma (MM), 8 with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), 6 (19.4%) had AML, 5 (16.1%) NHL, 2 (3.2%) ALL; CML, MDS and Polycythemia Vera occurred in 1 patient each. Twenty-four (77.4%) had active HM; 6 (19.4%) were in remission; and 1 relapsed. Nineteen patients (61.3%) received recent chemotherapy and 11 (35.5%) immunosuppressive therapies. There were 7 (22.6%) hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients (4 allogeneic and 3 autologous). Comorbidities were evenly distributed among all malignancies: 18 (58.1%) had hypertension, 9 (38.7%) obesity, 7 (22.6%) diabetes mellitus, and 11 (35.5%) were former smokers. The most common symptoms included cough (90.3%), fever (83.9%) and dyspnea (61.3%); 7 (22.6%) had nausea and vomiting; 7 (22.6%) had diarrhea. On presentation, hypoxia (O2 sat ≤94% on room air) occurred in 64.5%; median ALC was 330/ml; 23 (74.2%) had ALC< 1000/ml; median CRP was 15.9 mg/dl (2.5–40.4), ferritin 1162 ng/ml (264 - > 16500), and D-dimers 456 ng/ml (< 150–2418). Thirteen patients (41.9%) required ICU admission and were intubated; among those 9 (69.2%) had either MM or CLL. Co-infections were uncommon; two patients developed HSV1 pneumonitis and one of these also had CMV pneumonitis. Twenty-eight (90.3%) were treated with hydroxychloroquine, 5 (16.1%) remdesivir, 2 (6.5%) tocilizumab, 1 (3.2%) sarilumab, and 4 (12.9%) with methylprednisolone 0.5mg/kg Q12h. Seventeen patients (54.8%) recovered and were discharged, 12 (38.7%) died; 2 (6.5%) were still hospitalized but left the ICU. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, there were predominantly more patients with MM and CLL and 56% of these were intubated; larger cohort studies will further define the risk and outcome for COVID-19 in patients with HM.

In South Africa, patients have often expressed dissatisfaction with the quality of midwifery care. Negative interpersonal relationships with caregivers, lack of information, neglect and abandonment were consistent complaints. Less is known about how midwives experience providing care. AIM: This research explored and described the experiences of midwives in providing care to labouring women in varied healthcare settings. SETTING: Midwives practicing in the Gauteng province, South Africa, in one of three settings: private hospitals, public hospitals or independent maternity hospital. METHODS: A convenience sample of midwives (N = 10) were interviewed. An exploratory and descriptive design, with individual semi-structured interviews conducted, asked a primary question: ‘How is it for you to be a midwife in South Africa?’ Transcribed interviews were analysed using thematic coding. RESULTS: Five themes were found: proud to be a midwife, regulations and independent function, resource availability, work burden and image of the midwife. CONCLUSION: Midwives struggle within systems that fail to allow independent functioning, disallowing a voice in making decisions and creating change. Regardless of practice setting, midwives expressed frustration with policies that prevented utilisation consistent with scope of practice, as well as an inability to practice the midwifery model of care. Those in public settings expressed concern with restricted resource appropriation. Similarly, there is clear need to upscale midwifery education and to establish care competencies to be met in providing clinical services. CONTRIBUTION: This research provides evidence of the midwifery experience with implications for needed health policy change.","Hastings-Tolsma, Marie; Temane, Annie; Tagutanazvo, Oslinah B.; Lukhele, Sanele; Nolte, Anna G.",Health SA,555,10

Vaccination and antiviral drugs are the two methods opted to control the disease. Besides their efficiency, they also cause adverse side effects. Hence, scientists turned their attention to powerful herbal medicines. This review put focus on various proven, scientifically validated anti-influenza compounds produced by the plants suggested for the production of newer drugs for the better treatment of influenza and its related antiviral diseases too. MAIN BODY: In this review, fifty medicinal herb phytochemical constituents and their anti-influenza activities have been documented. Specifically, this review brings out the accurate and substantiates mechanisms of action of these constituents. This study categorizes the phytochemical constituents into primary and secondary metabolites which provide a source for synthesizing and developing new drugs. CONCLUSION: This article provides a summary of the actions of the herbal constituents. Since the mechanisms of action of the components are elucidated, the pandemic situation arising due to influenza and similar antiviral diseases can be handled promisingly with greater efficiency. However, clinical trials are in great demand. The formulation of usage may be a single drug compound or multi-herbal combination. These, in turn, open up a new arena for the pharmaceutical industries to develop innovative drugs.","Devi, A. Brindha; Sarala, R.",Futur J Pharm Sci,555,24

Achieving a correct diagnosis and a clear definition of a lymphoma’s subtype is crucial for beginning chemotherapy as soon as possible. However, most patients present a large mediastinal mass that compresses vessels and airway, with serious cardiorespiratory repercussions. Therefore, having multiple tools available to biopsy the lesion without worsening morbidity becomes fundamental. Patients enrolled in this study were unfit for a surgical biopsy in general anesthesia and the need to begin chemotherapy as fast as possible prompted us to avoid percutaneous fine needle aspiration to prevent diagnostic failures. Our observational study included 13 consecutive patients with radiological findings of anterior mediastinal mass. Ultrasonography was performed directly in the theatre to mark the lesion and to localize vessels and vascularized neoplastic tissue. Open biopsy was carried out in spontaneous breathing with a laryngeal mask and with short-acting medications for a rapid anesthesia, performing an anterior mediastinotomy. The mean operative time was 33.4 ± 6.2 min and spontaneous respiration was maintained throughout the procedure. No complications were reported. All patients were discharged in the first or second postoperative day after a chest X-ray (1.38 ± 0.5 days). The diagnostic yield of this approach was 100%. With the addition of ultrasonography right before the procedure and with spontaneous breathing, anterior mediastinotomy still represents a useful tool in critical patients that could hardly tolerate a general anesthesia. The diagnostic yield is high, and the low postoperative morbidity allows a rapid onset of chemotherapy.","Cascone, Roberto; Carlucci, Annalisa; Messina, Gaetana; Noro, Antonio; Bove, Mary; Natale, Giovanni; Sagnelli, Caterina; Opromolla, Giorgia; Martone, Mario; Santoriello, Carlo; Santoriello, Elena; Verolino, Pasquale; Creta, Massimiliano; Vicidomini, Giovanni; Fiorelli, Alfonso; Santini, Mario; Sica, Antonello",Healthcare (Basel),555,29

Adoptive transfer of virus-specific T-cells has proven to be safe and effective for the treatment of many viral infections, and could represent a novel treatment approach for chronic norovirus infection. Hence, we sought to generate human norovirus-specific T-cells (NSTs) that can recognize different viral sequences. METHODS NSTs were generated from peripheral blood of healthy donors by stimulation with overlapping peptide libraries spanning the entire coding sequence of the norovirus genome. RESULTS We successfully generated T-cells targeting multiple norovirus antigens with a mean 4.2 ± 0.5-fold expansion after 10 days. NSTs were comprised of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells that expressed markers for central memory and effector memory phenotype with minimal expression of co-inhibitory molecules, and were polyfunctional based on cytokine production. We identified novel CD4 and CD8-restricted immunodominant epitopes within NS6 and VP1 antigens. Furthermore, NSTs showed a high degree of cross-reactivity to multiple variant epitopes from clinical isolates. CONCLUSIONS Our findings identify immunodominant human norovirus T-cell epitopes and demonstrate that it is feasible to generate potent NSTs from third party donors for use in antiviral immunotherapy.","Hanajiri, Ryo; Sani, Gelina M; Saunders, Devin; Hanley, Patrick J; Chopra, Abha; Mallal, Simon A; Sosnovtsev, Stanislav V; Cohen, Jeffrey I; Green, Kim Y; Bollard, Catherine M; Keller, Michael D",The Journal of infectious diseases,555,16

Static and dynamic (vibration) needle insertion tests were performed to determine the maximum insertion forces and to estimate needle-tip deflection. Our results show that introducing vibration on the bioinspired needle insertion can reduce the maximum insertion force by up to 50%. It was also found that the needle-tip deflection is decreased by 47%.","Gidde, Sai Teja Reddy; Ciuciu, Alexandra; Devaravar, Neha; Doracio, Rafael; Kianzad, Kian; Hutapea, Parsaoran",Bioinspiration & biomimetics,555,16

We sought to understand factors associated with the evolution of meningococcal vaccination program recommendations in four countries with formal evaluation processes: the UK, US, the Netherlands, and Canada. AREAS COVERED A targeted review of published literature and internet sources for the four countries relating to meningococcal vaccination decision-making was conducted. The review focused on the impact of cost-effectiveness analyses on vaccine policy decisions and the extent to which variation in incidence of IMD and its potential catastrophic consequences influenced policy decisions. The evolution of meningococcal vaccine recommendations in the four countries was mainly driven by changes in vaccine availability and changes in serogroup incidence. Public pressure due to the catastrophic nature of IMD influenced recommendations. The role of cost-effectiveness analyses varied across the 4 countries. EXPERT OPINION The value of implementing meningococcal vaccination programs needs to be assessed using factors beyond those included in estimates from traditional cost-effectiveness analyses.","Huang, Liping; Mauskopf, Josephine; Farkouh, Ray; Masaquel, Catherine",Expert review of vaccines,555,8

Currently, there are no systematic reviews focusing on continuing education for health care professionals in data skills for QI. The purpose of this systematic review is to define effectiveness and sustainability of QI programs for health care professionals containing a measurement skills component and to identify barriers and facilitators to effectiveness and sustainability. METHODS The systematic review involved study identification, screening, full text review, and data extraction. Four electronics databases and grey literature sources were searched to identify studies published between 2009 and 2019 (11 years). A customized data extraction form was developed. Mixed methods appraisal tool was used for quality assessment and a thematic analysis was conducted for narrative synthesis. RESULTS Fifty-three studies from 11 countries were included. Most study designs were quantitative descriptive (17/53) and used a blended learning approach (25/53) combining face-to face and distance learning modes. The programs included basic, intermediate, and advanced data skills concepts. Overall, studies reported positive outcomes for participant reaction, learning, and behavior, but reported variable success in sustainability and spread of QI. DISCUSSION Studies discussed measurement as a key competency for clinical QI. Effectiveness definitions focused on the short-term impact of the programs, whereas sustainability definitions emphasized maintenance of outcomes and skills in the long-term. Factors that influenced effectiveness and sustainability of the included studies were strategic approach to QI, organizational support, intervention design, communication, accountability, leadership support, and learning networks.","Khurshid, Zuneera; De Brún, Aoife; Martin, Jennifer; McAuliffe, Eilish",The Journal of continuing education in the health professions,555,1

METHODS A descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study conducted on 258 pregnant women who were hospitalized due to confirmed COVID-19 from March 2020 to January 2021 at the Forghani Hospital in Qom, Iran. Demographic and obstetric characteristics, laboratory findings, and adverse maternal outcomes were recorded from the patients' medical records. The Fisher exact test, one-way analysis of variance, and regression logistics were used to assess the relationship between variables. RESULTS Of the total study population, 206 (79.8%) pregnant women had mild to moderate disease, 43 (16.7%) had severe disease, and 9 (3.5%) were in the critical stage of the disease. Eight women (3.1%) died and 33 (12.8%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The most important demographic factors associated with the severity of the disease were ethnicity, underlying conditions, maternal age, and parity. The severity of the disease was significantly associated with increased cesarean delivery and admission to the ICU. CONCLUSION Pregnant women with severe and critical disease had a high rate of cesarean delivery and admission to the ICU.

To reduce the risk of relapse or possible complications, this mesh needs to mimic the mechanical behavior of the muscle/fascia, which nowadays is not fully determined. The aim of this work is to develop a methodology to characterize in vivo the passive mechanical behavior of the abdominal wall. For that, New Zealand rabbits were subjected to pneumoperitoneum tests, taking the inner pressure from 0 mmHg to 12 mmHg, values similar to those used in human laparoscopies. Animals treated were divided into two groups: healthy and herniated animals with a surgical mesh (polypropylene Surgipro(TM) Covidien) previously implanted. All experiments were recorded by a stereo rig composed of two synchronized cameras. During the postprocessing of the images, several points over the abdominal surface were tracked and their coordinates extracted for different levels of internal pressure. Starting from that, a three dimensional model of the abdominal wall was reconstructed. Pressure-displacement curves, radii of curvature and strain fields were also analysed. During the experiments, animals tissue mostly deformed during the first levels of pressure, showing the noticeable hyperelastic passive behavior of abdominal muscles. Comparison between healthy and herniated specimen displayed a strong stiffening for herniated animals in the zone where the high density mesh was situated. Cameras were able to discern this change, so this method can be used to measure the possible effect of other meshes.","Simón-Allué, R; Montiel, J M M; Bellón, J M; Calvo, B",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,555,1

METHODS In this retrospective study, we carried out a quantitative evaluation of three methods commonly used for patients with severe traumatic brain injury (STBI). We recruited 150 patients who received airway humidification after tracheotomy. Subjects were divided into three groups according to the humidification method they received which included oxygen atomizer (OA) group, heat and moisture exchangers (HMEs) group, and heated humidifiers (HHs) group. Variables including phlegm viscosity, humidification effects, phlegm formation rates, daily sputum inhalation times, airway spasm, secondary lung infections, daily nursing load, and evaluation of nurse job satisfaction levels were documented. RESULTS Results indicated that the OA tended to cause either insufficient or excessive humidification, whereas phlegm scab formation was significantly reduced in HHs. HMEs and HHs displayed equal humidification effects, and a similar daily sputum induction and consequent nursing load. Airway spasm was a frequent occurrence in OA. The severity, but not the infection ratio, of secondary infection decreased significantly in HHs by the 30th day. The OA significantly reduced nursing load, but demonstrated the worst humidification effects. CONCLUSIONS Overall results suggested that the HHs is more suitable for airway nursing of STBI patients who are bedridden for extended periods.","Yin, Xiaohong; Yang, Lei; Sun, Hua; Yun, Zhilei; Wang, Yuxia; Ma, Banyou",Annals of palliative medicine,555,7

Its aetiology is incompletely understood. Evidence is growing that gadolinium contrast media is a major risk factor, whereby risk increases with larger cumulative doses. The role of other risk factors, such as inflammation or electrolyte disturbances, is less clear. All published cases to date received gadodiamide, gadopentetate or gadoversetamide, which are considered to be less stable due to a linear molecular structure. The aetiological significance of stability differences between the non-ionic linear, ionic linear and macrocyclic agents remains to be shown. For prevention, strict indications for MRI in risk patients can be combined with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMEA) guidelines. These recommend checking for renal impairment by history or laboratory tests. The FDA recommends avoidance of all gadolinium contrast media in patients with renal insufficiency grades 4 and 5 (glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) or any grade of acute renal failure in liver transplantation patients or candidates. The EMEA differentiates between agents and advises avoidance of only gadodiamide and gadopentetate in the same patient categories.

CASE PRESENTATION An 82-year-old man visited a previous hospital complaining of fever, general fatigue, and shaking chill, for which he received antibiotics therapy. As the fever continued, he was referred to our hospital, where computed tomography and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a 6-cm gastric tumor. A preoperative biopsy was consistent with a malignant mesenchymal tumor, but could not provide a definitive pathological diagnosis nor prove a cause-and-effect relationship between the chief complaint and the gastric tumor. The gastric tumor had grown to 8 cm in diameter within a month so we performed a partial gastrectomy. The pathological postoperative diagnosis was undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma that produced granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. The patient's fever quickly improved, and he showed a good postoperative course. CONCLUSIONS We herein report a case of rapidly growing, undifferentiated, high-grade pleomorphic gastric sarcoma, which presented as a chief complaint of fever.","Kabashima, Akira; Kimura, Koichi; Sanefuji, Kensaku; Masunari, Satoru; Haraoka, Seiji; Maekawa, Soichiro",Surgical case reports,555,1

Reviewing the different meniscal repair devices and sutures with their respective biomechanical properties. METHODS For this meta-analysis, we conducted a systematic online search using PubMed, EMBASE, CCTR, and CINAHL using the search terms Meniscus OR Meniscal AND Biomechanics AND Repair). Load-to-failure (LtF), stiffness, and cyclic outcome measures were extracted independently and in duplicate. The systematic search revealed 841 manuscripts in total. After exclusion of duplicates and irrelevant publications, 41 studies remained for final analysis. The studies were published in English and German from 1995 to 2013. Due to differing cyclic force protocols, cyclic outcomes had to be excluded. RESULTS Overall, sutures had a higher LtF [suture: 87.7 ± 0.3 N (weighted mean ± standard error), device: 56.3 ± 0.1 N] and stiffness (suture: 8.9 ± 0.04 N/mm, device: 8.6 ± 0.04 N/mm) than devices, both p < 0.05. In LfT testing, PDS 0 Vertical (145.0 ± 8.1 N), OrthoCord 2-0 (143.6 ± 11.3 N), and Ethibond No 0 Vertical (133.4 ± 7.7 N) were the strongest sutures and Meniscal Viper (140.9 ± 5.1 N), MaxFire Vertical (136.2 ± 11.3 N), and FasT-Fix Vertical (115.2 ± 1.6 N) were the strongest devices. Second-generation devices were significantly stronger and stiffer than first-generation devices (p < 0.001). CLINICAL RELEVANCE Suture repair remains the gold standard with a vertically oriented suture configuration showing superior LtF values compared to a horizontal configuration. Nevertheless, some meniscal repair devices have similar biomechanical properties to suture repairs. Both suture repairs and devices have a place in meniscal restoration.

Recruitment challenges must be understood. METHODS One hundred twenty participants were needed for a prospective randomized controlled trial investigating treatments for hyperglycemia and cardiovascular disease risk factors in patients with T2DM. The trial had two arms-intensive medical management plus a rigorous lifestyle intervention (LS/IMM) versus LS/IMM with RYGB. Medical inclusion criteria included glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 8.0 % while under the care of a physician and body mass index (BMI) 30.0-39.9 kg/m(2). Another inclusion criterion was expressed willingness to accept randomization and participate fully. Varied recruitment strategies were employed at four academic hospitals in the USA and Taiwan, including referrals, mass media, direct mail to patients drawn from a practice-based database, and direct mail to commercial mailing lists. RESULTS Between February 2008 and December 2011, 2,648 candidates were phone-screened and 240 were screened on site; 120 participants were eventually randomized. Impediments included stringent medical inclusion criteria and a lack of equipoise (i.e., strong beliefs or preferences) among patients and their personal community-based physicians. To meet timeline requirements, the upper limit for BMI was increased from 34.9 to 39.9 kg/m(2) and an additional site was added. CONCLUSIONS We successfully recruited 120 participants with poorly controlled T2DM and mild to moderate obesity. Participants had to be willing to accept randomization to either surgical or nonsurgical treatments.

Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), 4,-4'-azobis-4-cyanopentanoyl chloride (ACPC), and methacryloyl chloride were reacted via bulk condensation polymerization to synthesize the macroinimer. The organogel systems were then prepared with macroinimer using different acrylic monomers of methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, and butyl acrylate without any additional crosslinker and initiator. The structural properties of the obtained final products were characterized by FT-IR, 1H-NMR, and TGA. The effect of alkyl chain length and macroinimer moieties in the organogel networks, as well as the swelling capacities of the prepared gels, was evaluated for different organic solvents and oils. The maximum solvent absorbencies of macroinimer-based organogels were determined as 85.3%, 100.9%, 1422.1%, 1660.0%, 3809.3%, and 5032.2% for diesel oil, gasoline, acetone, benzene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and dichloromethane (DCM), respectively. Furthermore, adsorption-desorption kinetics, selective absorption from oil/water mixtures, temperature effect on the absorption capacity, and reusability tests were investigated. Obtained results showed that the prepared organogels possessed high swelling, efficient absorption capacity, and good oil separation performance in the removal of organic solvents from wastewater. The temperature-dependent absorption study shows no significant change in absorption capacity. Thus, the prepared macroinimer-based organogels in the present study demonstrate potential as prospective sorbents for organic pollutant cleanup from wastewater.","Erdem, Ahmet; Mammadli, Nigar; Yildiz, Ufuk",Environmental science and pollution research international,555,16

The biomaterial patch, derived from Bombyx mori silk fibroin (SF), is used as an alternative material due to its excellent tissue affinity and biocompatibility. However, SF lacks the elastomeric characteristics required for a cardiovascular patch. In order to overcome this shortcoming, we combined the thermoplastic polyurethane, Pellethane® (PU) with SF to develop an elastic biocompatible patch. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of the blended SF/PU patch in a vascular model. Additionally, we focused on the effects of different SF concentrations in the SF/PU patch on its biological and physical properties. Three patches of different compositions (SF, SF7PU3 and SF4PU6) were created using an electrospinning method. Each patch type (n = 18) was implanted into rat abdominal aorta and histopathology was assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months post-implantation. The results showed that with increasing SF content the tensile strength and elasticity decreased. Histological evaluation revealed that inflammation gradually decreased in the SF7PU3 and SF patches throughout the study period. At 6 months post-implantation, the SF7PU3 patch demonstrated progressive remodeling, including significantly higher tissue infiltration, elastogenesis and endothelialization compared with SF4PU6. In conclusion, an increase of SF concentration in the SF/PU patch had effects on vascular remodeling and physical properties. Moreover, our blended patch might be an attractive alternative material that could induce the growth of a neo-artery composed of tissue present in native artery.","Chantawong, Pinkarn; Tanaka, Takashi; Uemura, Akiko; Shimada, Kazumi; Higuchi, Akira; Tajiri, Hirokazu; Sakura, Kohta; Murakami, Tomoaki; Nakazawa, Yasumoto; Tanaka, Ryou",Journal of materials science.

OBJECTIVES To test whether mitochondrial alarmins are released during VILI, and are associated with lung inflammation. METHODS Release of mitochondrial DNA, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) peptide-dependent neutrophil chemotaxis were measured in conditioned supernatants from human alveolar type II-like (A549) epithelial cells submitted to cyclic stretch in vitro. Similar measurements were performed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from rabbits submitted to an injurious ventilatory regimen, and from patients with ARDS. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Mitochondrial DNA was released by A549 cells during cell stretching, and was found elevated in BAL fluids from rabbits during VILI, and from ARDS patients. Cyclic stretch-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) of A549 cells could be inhibited by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) blockade. ATP concentrations were increased in conditioned supernatants from A549 cells, and in rabbit BAL fluids during VILI. Neutrophil chemotaxis induced by A549 cells conditioned supernatants was essentially dependent on fMLP rather than IL-8. A synergy between cyclic stretch-induced alarmins and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was found in monocyte-derived macrophages in the production of IL-1ß. CONCLUSIONS Mitochondrial alarmins are released during cyclic stretch of human epithelial cells, as well as in BAL fluids from rabbits ventilated with an injurious ventilatory regimen, and found in BAL fluids from ARDS patients, particularly in those with high alveolar inflammation. These alarmins are likely to represent the proximal endogenous mediators of VILI and ARDS, released by injured pulmonary cells.","Grazioli, Serge; Dunn-Siegrist, Irène; Pauchard, Laure-Anne; Blot, Mathieu; Charles, Pierre-Emmanuel; Pugin, Jérôme",PloS one,555,4

It may cause tandem occlusions in which cervical carotid obstruction is associated with intracranial proximal vessel occlusion. To date, no consensus has emerged concerning endovascular treatment strategy. Our aim was to evaluate our endovascular ""distal-to-proximal"" strategy in the treatment of this stroke subtype in the first large multicentric cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS Prospectively managed stroke data bases from 2 separate centers were retrospectively studied between 2009 and 2014 for records of tandem occlusions related to internal carotid dissection. Atheromatous tandem occlusions were excluded. The first step in the revascularization procedure was intracranial thrombectomy. Then, cervical carotid stent placement was performed depending on the functionality of the circle of Willis and the persistence of residual cervical ICA occlusion, severe stenosis, or thrombus apposition. Efficiency, complications, and radiologic and clinical outcomes were recorded. RESULTS Thirty-four patients presenting with tandem occlusion stroke secondary to internal carotid dissection were treated during the study period. The mean age was 52.5 years, the mean initial NIHSS score was 17.29 ± 6.23, and the mean delay between onset and groin puncture was 3.58 ± 1.1 hours. Recanalization TICI 2b/3 was obtained in 21 cases (62%). Fifteen patients underwent cervical carotid stent placement. There was no recurrence of ipsilateral stroke in the nonstented subgroup. Twenty-one patients (67.65%) had a favorable clinical outcome after 3 months. CONCLUSIONS Endovascular treatment of internal carotid dissection-related tandem occlusion stroke using the distal-to-proximal recanalization strategy appears to be feasible, with low complication rates and considerable rates of successful recanalization.","Marnat, G; Bühlmann, M; Eker, O F; Gralla, J; Machi, P; Fischer, U; Riquelme, C; Arnold, M; Bonafé, A; Jung, S; Costalat, V; Mordasini, P",AJNR.

Several individual omics studies have extended our knowledge of COVID-19 pathophysiology1-10. Integration of such datasets to obtain a holistic view of virus-host interactions and to define the pathogenic properties of SARS-CoV-2 is limited by the heterogeneity of the experimental systems. We therefore conducted a concurrent multi-omics study of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Using state-of-the-art proteomics, we profiled the interactome of both viruses, as well as their influence on transcriptome, proteome, ubiquitinome and phosphoproteome in a lung-derived human cell line. Projecting these data onto the global network of cellular interactions revealed crosstalk between the perturbations taking place upon SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections at different layers and identified unique and common molecular mechanisms of these closely related coronaviruses. The TGF-β pathway, known for its involvement in tissue fibrosis, was specifically dysregulated by SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 and autophagy by SARS-CoV-2 ORF3. The extensive dataset (available at https://covinet.innatelab.org ) highlights many hotspots that can be targeted by existing drugs and it can guide rational design of virus- and host-directed therapies, which we exemplify by identifying kinase and MMPs inhibitors with potent antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2.","Stukalov, Alexey; Girault, Virginie; Grass, Vincent; Karayel, Ozge; Bergant, Valter; Urban, Christian; Haas, Darya A; Huang, Yiqi; Oubraham, Lila; Wang, Anqi; Hamad, M Sabri; Piras, Antonio; Hansen, Fynn M; Tanzer, Maria C; Paron, Igor; Zinzula, Luca; Enghleitner, Thomas; Reinecke, Maria; Lavacca, Teresa M; Ehmann, Rosina; Wölfel, Roman; Jores, Jörg; Kuster, Bernhard; Protzer, Ulrike; Rad, Roland; Ziebuhr, John; Thiel, Volker; Scaturro, Pietro; Mann, Matthias; Pichlmair, Andreas",Nature,555,24

METHODS A cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted at 4 sites in Northwest India. The migrant workers were recruited from various shelter homes, and information was gathered from reverse migrant workers and controls using various tools including a sociodemographic profile; knowledge, attitudes, and practices questionnaire; and reasons for migration and reverse migration questionnaires. A total of 275 reverse migrant workers and 276 controls participated in the study. RESULTS There was a considerable difference between reverse migrant workers and controls regarding the question of whether it was safe to travel during lockdown (76.0% vs 26.4%, respectively). The most common route of spread of COVID-19 infection was through touching and sneezing, and symptoms were fever, dry cough, and sore throat in both groups. Reverse migrant workers had low self-esteem and were reluctant to participate in customs of their migration city. A large number of reverse migrant workers reported that they had no money to survive, worried about family back home at their village, felt pressured by family members to come back to the village, and had been terminated from their job. CONCLUSIONS Reverse migrant workers had the attitude that it was safe to travel during the lockdown. About one-fifth of the reverse migrant workers reported no place to live and fear of getting an infection. The reverse migrant workers also reported feeling low and gloomy, restless, and uncertain about the future and fear of death. Lack of jobs was a major factor driving migrant workers from their native homes.","Chavan, B S; Sidana, Ajeet; Arun, Priti; Rohilla, Ravi; Singh, Gurvinder Pal; Solanki, R K; Aneja, Jitender; Murara, Mankirat Kaur; Verma, Madhur; Chakraborty, Saikat",The primary care companion for CNS disorders,555,17

Prevention and interventions specifically designed for older people are not common, and those designed for mixed-age groups may fail to address the unique and sometimes complex needs of ageing communities. We report findings from a systematic review of the empirical evidence from studies which formally evaluated interventions used with older people and reported their outcomes. Nineteen studies were included, of which thirteen focused solely on alcohol-related problems. Eight interventions utilised different types of screening, brief advice and education. The remaining drew on behavioural, narrative and integrated or multi-disciplinary approaches, which aimed to meet older people's needs holistically. Quality assessment of study design helped to review evaluation practice. Findings point to recommendations for sustainable and well-designed intervention strategies for PSU in later life, which purposefully align with other areas of health and well-being and are delivered in locations where older people normally seek, or receive, help. There is further scope for engagement with older people's own perspectives on their needs and help-seeking behaviours.

The world has thoroughly been affected by COVID-19, while there has been little progress towards understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Patients with a severe phenotype of disease and those who died from the disease have shown hyperinflammation and were more likely to develop neurological manifestations, linking the clinical disease with neuroimmunological features. Anosmia frequently occurs early in the course of COVID-19. The prevalence of anosmia would be influenced by self-diagnosis as well as self-misdiagnosis in patients with COVID-19. Despite this, the association between anosmia and COVID-19 has been a hope for research, aiming to understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Studies have suggested differently probable mechanisms for the development of anosmia in COVID-19, including olfactory cleft syndrome, postviral anosmia syndrome, cytokine storm, direct damage of olfactory sensory neurons, and impairment of the olfactory perception center in the brain. Thus, the observation of anosmia would direct us to find the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in the central nervous system, and this is consistent with numerous neurological manifestations related to COVID-19. Like other neurotropic viruses, SARS-CoV-2 might be able to enter the central nervous system via the olfactory epithelium and induce innate immune responses at the site of entry. Viral replication in the nonneural olfactory cells indirectly causes damage to the olfactory receptor nerves, and as a consequence, anosmia occurs. Further studies are required to investigate the neuroimmunology of COVID-19 in relation to anosmia.","Yazdanpanah, Niloufar; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Reviews in the neurosciences,555,17

Humans have five gzms (gzms A, B, H, K, and M), which differ in their substrate specificity. It is widely accepted that they are delivered from cytotoxic lymphocytes via perforin into the cytoplasm of target cells where they initiate cell death, modulate cytokine signaling, or inactivate pathogen proteins. However, more recent evidence indicates gzms also act extracellularly in noncytotoxic processes. Proteomic approaches are directed at mapping gzm cleavage specificity, identifying substrates, and unraveling the (patho-) physiological role of these proteases. These studies have refined our understanding of gzm species specificity, and collectively uncovered an enormous number of new substrates. However, with the exception of a very few human gzmB substrates supported by independent data (Bid, DNA-PK, PARP, ICAD, and procaspase 7), it is presently unclear which are physiologically relevant.

We propose that DNA damage induced-apoptosis accelerates viral release, triggered by depletion of host RNA binding proteins (RBPs) from nuclear RNA bound to replicating viral sequences. Methods: Information theory-based analysis of interactions between RBPs and individual sequences in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Influenza A (H3N2), HIV-1, and Dengue genomes identifies strong RBP binding sites in these viral genomes. Replication and expression of viral sequences is expected to increasingly sequester RBPs - SRSF1 and RNPS1. Ordinarily, RBPs bound to nascent host transcripts prevents their annealing to complementary DNA. Their depletion induces destabilizing R-loops. Chromosomal breakage occurs when an excess of unresolved R-loops collide with incoming replication forks, overwhelming the DNA repair machinery. We estimated stoichiometry of inhibition of RBPs in host nuclear RNA by counting competing binding sites in replicating viral genomes and host RNA. Results: Host RBP binding sites are frequent and conserved among different strains of RNA viral genomes. Similar binding motifs of SRSF1 and RNPS1 explain why DNA damage resulting from SRSF1 depletion is complemented by expression of RNPS1. Clustering of strong RBP binding sites coincides with the distribution of RNA-DNA hybridization sites across the genome. SARS-CoV-2 replication is estimated to require 32.5-41.8 hours to effectively compete for binding of an equal proportion of SRSF1 binding sites in host encoded nuclear RNAs. Significant changes in expression of transcripts encoding DNA repair and apoptotic proteins were found in an analysis of influenza A and Dengue-infected cells in some individuals. Conclusions: R-loop-induced apoptosis indirectly resulting from viral replication could release significant quantities of membrane-associated virions into neighboring alveoli. These could infect adjacent pneumocytes and other tissues, rapidly compromising lung function, causing multiorgan system failure and other described symptoms.","Rogan, Peter K; Mucaki, Eliseos J; Shirley, Ben C",F1000Research,555,1

Therefore, on the basis of results obtained in our department, the present study was conducted to reevaluate the current state of needlescopic surgery (NS) to improve the cosmetic results and postoperative quality of life of patients and to reduce cost and degree of stress on surgeons. METHODS Between May 1998 and February 2011, we performed NS in 202 patients. The diagnoses included gallbladder diseases in 151 patients, spontaneous pneumothorax in 11, thyroid tumor and axillary lymph node metastases in 10 patients each, splenic cyst and appendicitis in 4 patients each, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and postoperative abdominal wall hernia in 3 patients each, primary aldosteronism and hepatic cyst in 2 patients each, and adhesional bowel obstruction and gastric stromal tumor in 1 patient each. Under general anesthesia, one 12-mm and tow or three 2- or 3-mm ports were introduced into the operative field. The specimen was retrieved via the 12-mm wound using a plastic bag. RESULTS The operations were completed in all patients without the need to convert to an open procedure. In 8 (5.3%) of the 151 cholecystectomies, a change to 5-mm instruments was required. There were no perioperative complications. Pertinent technical points included avoidance of direct organ mobilization to minimize injury, rotation of the operating table and utilization of organ gravity to create a better operative field, minimum use of needlescope to ensure safe maneuvering, and improvement of the bi-hand technique. CONCLUSIONS NS is a safe and feasible procedure that allows experienced surgeons to achieve minimally invasive surgery with low morbidity, without the need to convert to a conventional or open procedure.","Tagaya, Nobumi; Kubota, Keiichi",Surgical endoscopy,555,1

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between enzymatic and antiviral activities of ChOAS-L. Eight mutated ChOAS-L proteins were generated using either the site-directed mutagenesis or standard polymerase chain reaction protocol. The wild-type and mutated proteins were ectopically expressed in 293FT cells to analyze the enzymatic activity and in BHK-21 and BALB/3T3 cells to analyze the antiviral activity using WNV replicon.

Objective This article aims to broaden the current discussion on the psychiatric sequalae of COVID-19, which has largely focused on anxiety, and examine the recently documented psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 infection, the secondary effects of the pandemic on public mental health, and future psychiatric conditions that may arise due to COVID-19. Methods We conducted an in-depth review of the current global psychiatric literature and describe the wide range of psychopathological presentations reported among past COVID-19 patients worldwide and those that are expected to emerge. Results Current discussions in the psychiatric literature on COVID-19 report anxiety and anxiety disorders as a predominant set of clinical presentations during the pandemic. The impacts of direct COVID-19 infection, associated psychopathological sequelae, and drastic lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa, are associated with a broad range of psychopathologies and other neuropsychiatric presentations. Pre-existing societal conditions and burdens on the health system in South Africa prompt healthcare providers and public health planners to accordingly prepare for the expected rise in new psychiatric presentations. Conclusion Greater awareness of the various psychiatric conditions attributed to COVID-19 infection may allow for earlier screening, more effective treatment, and greater positive health outcomes and better prepare health systems to address the growing pandemic in South Africa.","Subramaney, Ugasvaree; Kim, Andrew Wooyoung; Chetty, Indhrin; Chetty, Shren; Jayrajh, Preethi; Govender, Mallorie; Maharaj, Pralene; Pak, EungSok",Wits journal of clinical medicine,555,31

Despite the numerous advances, the scarceness of methods for the preparation of 1,5-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles from readily available substrates remained a challenge that was addressed by our group in 2016. A metal-free three-component reaction, which we have dubbed the triazolization reaction, was established for the rapid synthesis of 1,5-disubstituted, fully functionalized and NH-1,2,3-triazoles. This novel approach stands out because it utilizes widely available starting materials, namely primary amines and enolizable ketones. Furthermore, the broad substrate scope is a major advantage, and was further expanded by the number of modified protocols that have been reported. Triazolization products have successfully found utility as intermediates in various synthetic transformations, and were the subject of a few interesting biological activity studies.","Prakash, Rashmi; Opsomer, Tomas; Dehaen, Wim",Chemical record,555,12

This is based on the observation that malignant cells express a spectrum of human endogenous retroviral elements (HERVs) which can be transcriptionally boosted by HDAC inhibitors. The endoretroviral gene HERV-V2 codes for an envelope protein, which resembles syncytins. It is significantly overexpressed upon exposure to HDAC inhibitors and can be effectively targeted by simultaneous application of TLR7/8 agonists, triggering intrinsic apoptosis. We demonstrated that this synergistic cytotoxic effect was accompanied by the functional disruption of the TLR7/8-NFκB, Akt/PKB, and Ras-MEK-ERK signalling pathways. CRISPR/Cas9 ablation of TLR7 and HERV-V1/V2 curtailed apoptosis significantly, proving the pivotal role of these elements in driving cell death. The effectiveness of this new approach was confirmed in ovarian tumour xenograft studies, revealing a promising avenue for future cancer therapies.","Díaz-Carballo, David; Saka, Sahitya; Acikelli, Ali H; Homp, Ekaterina; Erwes, Julia; Demmig, Rebecca; Klein, Jacqueline; Schröer, Katrin; Malak, Sascha; D'Souza, Flevy; Noa-Bolaño, Adrien; Menze, Saskia; Pano, Emilio; Andrioff, Swetlana; Teipel, Marc; Dammann, Philip; Klein, Diana; Nasreen, Amber; Tannapfel, Andrea; Grandi, Nicole; Tramontano, Enzo; Ochsenfarth, Crista; Strumberg, Dirk",Communications biology,555,19

Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) is a new treatment in which the rectum is dissected transanally according to TME principles. The short-term results and oncological follow-up of the first 80 patients were described. METHODS Between June 2012 and September 2014, all patients in the Gelderse Vallei Hospital and the VU University Medical Center with histologically proven distal or mid-rectal carcinomas without evidence of distant metastases underwent TaTME. Patients with T4 tumors were excluded. Transanal mobilization was performed with the aid of a single port and endoscopic instruments according to TME criteria. RESULTS Eighty patients were operated in a period of 2 years. Laparotomy was recommended and performed in four patients. Postoperative morbidity was 39%. Ten (12%) complications were graded as severe (Clavien-Dindo grade 3, 4 and 5) and needed re-intervention. Median operative time was 204 min (range 91-447). Median hospital stay was 8 days (range 3-41). Specimens were graded as complete in 88% of the patients, nearly complete in 9% and incomplete in 3%. A positive circumferential resection margin (<2 mm) was observed in two patients. During the two and half years study period, a local recurrence was observed in two patients. CONCLUSION TaTME is a safe alternative to standard laparoscopic TME in selected low-risk patients with rectal carcinoma when treated by an experienced colorectal team. In the future, randomized trials are necessary to prove its oncological safety.","Veltcamp Helbach, M; Deijen, C L; Velthuis, S; Bonjer, H J; Tuynman, J B; Sietses, C",Surgical endoscopy,555,16

The existence of astroviruses (AstVs) in dromedaries was previously unknown. We describe the discovery of a novel dromedary camel AstV (DcAstV) from dromedaries in Dubai. Among 215 dromedaries, DcAstV was detected in faecal samples of four [three (1.5 %) adult dromedaries and one (8.3 %) dromedary calf] by reverse transcription-PCR. Sequencing of the four DcAstV genomes and phylogenetic analysis showed that the DcAstVs formed a distinct cluster. Although DcAstV was most closely related to a recently characterized porcine AstV 2, their capsid proteins only shared 60-66 % amino acid identity, with a mean amino acid genetic distance of 0.372. Notably, the N-terminal halves of the capsid proteins of DcAstV shared ≤ 85 % amino acid identity, but the C-terminal halves only shared ≤ 49 % amino acid identity compared with the corresponding proteins in other AstVs. A high variation of the genome sequences of DcAstV was also observed, with a mean amino acid genetic distance of 0.214 for ORF2 of the four strains. Recombination analysis revealed a possible recombination event in ORF2 of strain DcAstV-274. The low Ka/Ks ratios (number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site to number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site) of the four ORFs in the DcAstV genomes supported the suggestion that dromedaries are the natural reservoir where AstV is stably evolving. These results suggest that AstV is a novel species of the genus Mamastrovirus in the family Astroviridae. Further studies are important to understand the pathogenic potential of DcAstV.","Woo, Patrick C Y; Lau, Susanna K P; Teng, Jade L L; Tsang, Alan K L; Joseph, Sunitha; Xie, Jun; Jose, Shanty; Fan, Rachel Y Y; Wernery, Ulrich; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",The Journal of general virology,555,23

The initial plan of action has been to carefully study the best-practice techniques for open RP in order to reproduce and standardize performance from the laparoscopic perspective. Similar to open surgery, the learning curve of minimally invasive RP has been well documented in terms of objective evaluation of outcomes for cancer control and functional results. Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) have recently gained momentum as feasible techniques for minimal access urological surgery. NOTES-LESS drastically limit the surgeon's ability to choose the site of entry for operative instruments; therefore, the advantages of NOTES-LESS are gained with the understanding that the surgical procedure is more technically challenging. There are several key elements in RP techniques (in particular, dorsal vein control, apex exposure and cavernosal nerve sparing) that can have significant implications on oncologic and functional results. These steps are hard to perform in a limited working field. LESS radical prostatectomy can clearly be facilitated by using robotic technology.","Barret, Eric; Sanchez-Salas, Rafael; Ercolani, Matthew C; Rozet, Francois; Galiano, Marc; Cathelineau, Xavier",Future oncology,555,31

METHODS Patients undergoing isolated CABG in six hospitals in Brazil were divided into two periods: pre-COVID-19 (March-May 2019, N = 468) and COVID-19 era (March-May 2020, N = 182). Perioperative data were included on a dedicated REDCap platform. Patients with clinical and tomographic criteria and/or PCR (+) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were considered COVID-19 (+). Logistic regression analysis was performed to create a multiple predictive model for mortality after CABG in COVID-19 era. RESULTS Compared to 2019, in 2020, CABG surgeries had a 2.8-fold increased mortality risk (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1-7.6, p = .041), patients who evolved with COVID-19 had a 11-fold increased mortality risk (95% CI: 2.2-54.9, p < .003), rates of morbidities and readmission to the intensive care unit. The surgical volume was decreased by 60%. The model to predict mortality after CABG in the COVID-19 era was validated with good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow = 1.43) and discrimination (receiver operating characteristic = 0.78).

While patients typically present with fever and a respiratory illness, some patients also report gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Studies have identified the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens of infected patients, and its viral receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was found to be highly expressed in gastrointestinal epithelial cells.

Industry 4.0 and IoT technologies facilitate the acquisition of ubiquitous data from machine tools and processes. However, these technologies also lead to the generation of a large number of data that are complex to be analyzed. Due to the streaming nature of the IoT systems, however, stream analytics could be used to extract features as the data are generated and published, which can prevent the need to store the data and perform advanced analytics that require high performance computing. This manuscript aims at demonstrating how traditional historical methods can be modified to be used as stream analytics tools for IoT data streams. Since data analytics is a wide domain, this paper has only focused on the two light-weighted methods that have been popular in the industry: Statistical Process Control Chart (SPCC), and Bayesian classification. This paper has defined, tested, and evaluated the accuracy and latency of the novel variation of these methods. It is concluded that by modifying the traditional methods and defining incremental solutions, methods such as Real-Time Dynamic Statistical Process Control Chart (RTDSPCC) and Incremental Gaussian Naïve Bayes (IGNB) can be formed that are highly beneficial for IoT applications as they are highly scalable, require minimal storage, and can update the models in real-time.","Parto, Mahmoud; Saldana, Christopher; Kurfess, Thomas",Procedia Manufacturing,555,1

Exploring the structure and dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, we argue that the high mutability characteristic of RNA viruses coupled with the remarkable flexibility and dynamics of viral proteins result in a substantial involvement of allosteric mechanisms. While allosteric effects of mutations should be considered in predictions and diagnostics of new VOCs, allosteric drugs advantageously avoid escaping mutations via non-competitive inhibition originating from many alternative distal locations. The exhaustive allosteric signalling and probing maps provide a comprehensive picture of allostery in the Spike protein, making it possible to locate sites of potential mutations that could work as new VOCs “drivers”, and to determine binding patches that may be targeted by newly developed allosteric drugs.","Tan, Zhen Wah; Tee, Wei-Ven; Samsudin, Firdaus; Guarnera, Enrico; Bond, Peter J.; Berezovsky, Igor N.",bioRxiv,555,24

This led to substantial reductions in traffic, making roads much safer for cyclists. This provides a unique opportunity to study the role played by safe cycling infrastructure. Many UK cities have provided cycling infrastructure to improve safety and encourage cycling. However, access to safe cycling infrastructure varies across neighbourhoods, potentially contributing to inequality. Since roads became safer due to the unprecedented reduction in traffic during the lockdown, safe cycling infrastructure may not play a significant role during this period. On the other hand, safe cycling lanes are often connected to amenities, potentially attracting cyclists even if they confer no additional safety benefit. That is, connectivity might matter more than safety. In this study, we utilised crowdsourced cycling data and regression models to examine the extent to which cycling intensity for non-commuting purposes changes with different types of cycling infrastructure in the city of Glasgow, Scotland, UK. In addition, we selected some areas with large increases in cycling intensity and examined the surrounding environments using Google Street View. Our results showed that non-commuting cycling activities increased significantly after the government interventions on both typical roads and safe cycling lanes while much higher increases were observed on safe cycling lanes than on other roads. A further analysis showed that there were large increases in cycling volumes on both typical roads and safe cycling lanes with good amenities and connectivity, highlighting the importance of these factors when building new cycling infrastructure. Since safe cycling lanes are not equally accessible to people, providing temporary cycling lanes during the pandemic considering these conditions could encourage people to cycle more, and thereby improve their health.","McArthur, David Raturi Varun",Sustainability,555,16

Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis (ROC) found that participant DBS samples tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG by MSD V-PLEX COVID-19 Coronavirus Panel 2 assay accurately classify SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion at an 88% percent rate, AUC= 88% (95% CI: 81%-96%). Modelling found that a DBS-based testing approach has a high positive predictive value (PPV) (98% [95% CI: 98%-99%]) in a theoretical population with seventy-five percent COVID-19 vaccine coverage. At lower vaccine coverages of fifteen and forty-five percent, the test's PPV decreased and the negative predictive value increased. Conclusion: We demonstrate that DBS samples, when tested using an electrochemiluminescence assay, provide a valid alternative to traditional venipuncture and should be considered to reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity.","Nikiforuk, A.

To accomplish this objective, this paper seeks to answer the following research questions: What is the current state of the art of the literature on the COVID-19 pandemic and consumption/consumer behavior? What are the disruptions in consumer’s lives that the literature has been discussing? What are the gaps in the research on Consumption/Consumer Behavior and the COVID-19 Pandemic? Methodology: We conducted a scoping review of the literature using data from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. We performed a bibliometric analysis, thematic analysis, and content analysis. Main Results: Brifely, we found seven main topics in the literature: Changes in Consumer Behavior;Coping with the Lockdowns;Information Seeking and Sharing;Psychological Effects;Addictive Behavior;Changes in Food Consumption;Panic Buying and Hoarding Behavior. Also, emerging themes from consumption, as the antecedents of consumption and the crisis effect on human behavior have been explored. The survey method using SEM is the principal methology and samples were mainly from the USA and China. Theoretical and Methodological Contributions: We provide evidence-based information to the marketing literature, consumer research, and practitioners on how the pandemic has affected the consumer domain. Relevance/Originality: We highlight consumer behavior in a pandemic context from a research and managerial perspectives. We provide a literature review that identify the topocs, methods, and overall discussions regarding the pandemic effects on consumption and consumer behavior that can support companies in undestanding the behavior and also trigger more research and development of public and organizational policies.

The standard diagnostic approach that widely adopted in the clinic is nuclear acid detection by real-time RT-PCR. However, the false-negative rate of the technique is unneglectable and serological methods are urgently warranted. Here, we presented the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic (ICG) strip targeting viral IgM or IgG antibody and compared it with real-time RT-PCR. The sensitivity of ICG assay with IgM and IgG combinatorial detection in nuclear acid confirmed cases were 11.1%, 92.9% and 96.8% at the early stage (1-7 days after onset), intermediate stage (8-14 days after onset), and late stage (more than 15 days), respectively. The ICG detection capacity in nuclear acid-negative suspected cases was 43.6%. In addition, the consistencies of whole blood samples with plasma were 100% and 97.1% in IgM and IgG strips, respectively. In conclusion, serological ICG strip assay in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection is both sensitive and consistent, which is considered as an excellent supplementary approach in clinical application.","Pan, Yunbao; Li, Xinran; Yang, Gui; Fan, Junli; Tang, Yueting; Zhao, Jin; Long, Xinghua; Guo, Shuang; Zhao, Ziwu; Liu, Yinjuan; Hu, Hanning; Xue, Han; Li, Yirong",,555,19

The aim of this study to provide evidence on Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine side effects. Methods A cross-sectional survey study was conducted between January and April 2021 to collect data on the effects of COVID-19 vaccine among individuals in the UAE. Demographic data chronic conditions side effects of the 1st and 2nd dose toward the vaccination, and the response of unwilling taking COVID-19 vaccine were reported. Results The most common side effects of post 1st dose (less than 49 years old vs >49 years) were normal injection site pain, fatigue, and headache while pain at the vaccination site fatigue lethargy headache and tenderness were the most side effects of the post 2nd dose in both groups. All the side effects in both doses were more prevalent among the participants less than 49-year-old group. Among females vs males side effects were more common in females compared with males in both doses in both doses. The most common adverse reactions of 1st dose in (females vs males) were fatigue lethargy headache while in 2nd dose were fatigue sever injection site pain. The most common reason of not willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine were the vaccines are not effective and they were not authorized to take vaccine. Conclusion The 1st and 2nd dose post-vaccination side effects were mild predictable and there were no hospitalization cases this data will help to reduce the vaccine hesitancy.","Qubais, B.; Al-Shahrabi, R.; Alhaj, S.

We show that theory developed for the evolution of physiological parasite resistance can only be applied to behavioral resistance under limited circumstances. We find that accounting explicitly for the behavioral processes, including the detectability of infected individuals, leads to novel dynamics that are strongly dependent on the nature of the costs and benefits of social interactions. As with physiological resistance, the evolutionary dynamics can also lead to mixed strategies that balance the costs of disease risk and the benefits of social interaction, with implications for understanding avoidance strategies in human disease outbreaks.","Amoroso, Caroline R.; Antonovics, Janis",bioRxiv,555,1

The patients use a single-dose of the study medication for a moderate or severe pain intensity migraine attack. Patients were adults with migraine with or without aura experiencing 2 to 20 (average 6.4) monthly migraine days. The co-primary endpoints were pain-freedom and absence of prospectively-identified most bothersome migraine-associated symptom 2 hours after dosing. We randomized 92 patients; 72 completed the study (mean age, 43 years; 75% women). Pain-freedom at 2 hours was 10.2% higher than placebo with naltrexone 2.25 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg, 10.9% with naltrexone 3.25 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg, 17.3% with naltrexone 2.25 mg, and 31.3% with acetaminophen 325 mg. The treatment groups' migraine burden was unbalanced due to randomized patients' uneven study completion. The acetaminophen group had the lowest migraine burden, giving its results lower credibility. The naltrexone and the placebo groups were the largest and had a balanced disease burden, lending higher credibility to the naltrexone group results. We found low-dose naltrexone/acetaminophen, low-dose naltrexone, and acetaminophen had higher response rates than placebo in treating headache pain. Saliently, Low-dose naltrexone alone (n=19) had a 17.3% higher response rate than placebo (n=17) for headache pain-freedom at 2 hours. The most commonly reported adverse events were sedation, nausea, and dizziness. We postulate that naltrexone's toll-like receptor (TLR4) antagonism properties prevent pro-inflammatory cytokines' production, leading to the trigeminal ganglion neurons becoming ''overactive'' and migraine. Although this trial used low-dose naltrexone (defined as 1 - 5 mg/day), we postulate mid-dose naltrexone (MDN) (defined as 6 - 10 mg/day) may offer a greater acute migraine control.","Toledano, A.

Here, we present a tolerance analysis of all the optical elements in both the calibration and measurement procedures to predict the sensitivities of the double-pass polarimeter. The calibration procedure is described by a Mueller matrix based on the eigenvalue calibration method (ECM). Our numerical results from the calibration and measurement in the Mueller matrix description with tolerances limited by systematic and stochastic noise from specifications of commercially available hardware components are in good agreement with previous experimental observations. Furthermore, by using the orientation Zernike polynomials (OZP) which are an extension of the Jones matrix formalism, similar to the Zernike polynomials wavefront expansion, the pupil distribution of the polarization properties of non-depolarizing samples under test are expanded. Using polar angles ranging up to 25$^{\circ}$, we predict a sensitivity of 0.5% for diattenuation and 0.3$^{\circ}$ for retardance using the root mean square (RMS) of the corresponding OZP coefficients as a measure of the error. This numerical tool provides an approach for further improving the sensitivities of polarimeters via error budgeting and replacing sensitive components with those having better precision.","Yu, Yimin; Baba-Ali, Nabila; Gallatin, Gregg M",,555,16

The first one corresponds to apply traditional textual pre-processing strategies in the texts extracted from articles and constructing their data representations. The topic modeling block aims at finding semantic topics from articles based on the most relevant words of each discovered topic. The third block correlates these discovered topics with the articles, authors (researchers), and institutions. The summarization interface provides an intuitive visualization for these results. Our evaluation shows that our framework can automatically extract relevant features from the articles, identifying the key topics covered by them, as well as the contribution of researchers, institutions, and countries to the topics.

Lymphocyte proliferation and delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection have been demonstrated. However, the polypeptide specificity of T cell responses to PRRSV is unknown. To identify the PRRSV polypeptides recognized by porcine lymphocytes two approaches were employed. First polypeptides of purified virions were separated by SDS-PAGE and particle suspensions obtained from nitrocellulose blots were used as antigens. Second, the polypeptides encoded by ORFs 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the strain VR-2332 were expressed as fusion proteins with a histidine tag in mammalian cells, using vaccinia virus as expression system. Significant antigen-specific proliferation responses to the matrix and envelope proteins from purified virions were obtained. This finding was supported by specific and dose-dependent proliferation responses to the recombinant polypeptides encoded by ORF2, 5 and 6 detected in virus-infected but not in control pigs. These results demonstrate that T-cell responses can be detected to individual PRRSV polypeptides. The greater response to the product of ORF6 than to the other PRRSV polypeptides indicates that the viral matrix polypeptide may have a major role in cellular immunity.","Bautista, E M; Suárez, P; Molitor, T W",Archives of virology,555,30

MATERIALS AND METHODS For a 10-year period between 1998 and 2007 we studied the trend, epidemiological characteristics, proportion of imported versus local transmission of malaria, viral hepatitis (hepatitis A and E), enteric fevers (typhoid and paratyphoid), cholera, chikungunya and SARS. RESULTS Of a total of 4617 cases of the above selected diseases notified in Singapore, 3599 (78.0%) were imported. The majority of the imported cases originated from Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Malaria constituted the largest bulk (of which 95.9% of the 2126 reported cases were imported), followed by hepatitis A (57.1% of 1053 cases imported), typhoid (87.6% of 596 cases imported), paratyphoid (87.6% of 241 cases imported), and hepatitis E (68.8% of 231 cases imported). Furthermore, there were 14 cases of imported cholera, 6 cases of imported severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and 13 cases of imported chikungunya. CONCLUSION This study underlines that diseases such as malaria, viral hepatitis and enteric fever occur in Singapore mainly because of importation. The main origin of importation was South and Southeast Asia. The proportion of imported diseases in relation to overall passenger traffic has decreased over the past 10 years.","Lee, Glenn K M; Tan, Kian Wee; Goh, Kee Tai; Wilder-Smith, Annelies","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",555,17

The oligonucleotides used were based on sequences of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the coronavirus of domestic fowl. A RT-PCR for the highly conserved region II of the 3' untranslated region of the IBV genome detected a coronavirus in swabs from 18/21 estates. Sequence identity with the corresponding region of IBVs and coronaviruses from turkeys was > 95%. A RT-PCR for part of the S1 region of the spike protein gene was positive with 13/21 of the samples. Sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products derived from nine of the pheasant viruses revealed that some of the viruses differed from each other by approximately 24%, similar to the degree of difference exhibited by different serotypes of IBV. Further analysis of the genome of one of the viruses revealed that it contained genes 3 and 5 that are typical of IBV but absent in both the transmissible gastroenteritis virus and murine hepatitis virus groups of mammalian coronaviruses. The nucleotide sequences of genes 3 and 5 of the pheasant virus had a similar degree of identity (approximately 90%) with those of coronaviruses from turkeys and chickens, as is observed when different serotypes of IBV are compared. This work: (a) confirms that coronaviruses are present in pheasants (indeed, commonly present in pheasants with respiratory disease); (b) demonstrates that their genomes are IBV-like in their organization; and (c) shows that there is sequence heterogeneity within the group of pheasant coronaviruses, especially within the spike protein gene. Furthermore, the gene sequences of the pheasant viruses differed from those of IBV to similar extents as the sequence of one serotype of IBV differs from another. On the genetic evidence to date, there is a remarkably high degree of genetic similarity between the coronaviruses of chickens, turkeys and pheasants.","Cavanagh, D; Mawditt, K; Welchman, D De B; Britton, P; Gough, R E",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,555,16

The organization of intra-alveolar fibrin exudates along with the interstitial fibrosis led to obliteration of alveoli and consolidation of lungs. The desquamation and hyperplasia of alveolar lining cells was also apparent. Foci of haemorrhage and lobular pneumonia, even diffuse fungal infection were frequently seen in these specimens. Micro-thrombus were easily found in these lungs. CONCLUSIONS The lung of SARS from autopsy is characterized by edema, intra-alveolar fibrin exudates, hyaline membrane formation, organization of intra-alveolar exudates and fibrosis, which lead to the obliteration of alveoli and consolidation of lungs.","Chen, Jie; Xie, Yong-qiang; Zhang, Hong-tu; Wan, Jian-wei; Wang, De-tian; Lu, Zhao-hui; Wang, Qing-zhi; Xue, Xin-hua; Si, Wen-xue; Luo, Yu-feng; Qiu, Hong-mei",Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

One enigmatic aspect of this disease is the protean nature of the clinical manifestations, ranging from total absence of symptoms to extremely severe cases with multiorgan failure and death. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) has emerged as the primary risk factor in the most severe patients, apart from age. Kidney disease and acute kidney injury have been correlated with a higher risk of death. Notably the Italian Society of Nephrology have reported a 10-fold increase in mortality in patients undergoing dialysis compared to the rest of the population, especially during the second phase of the pandemic (26% vs 2.4). These dramatic numbers require an immediate response. At the moment of writing, three Covid-19 vaccines are being administered already , two of which, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, share the same mRNA mechanism and Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) based on a more traditional approach. All of them are completely safe and reliable. The AIFA scientific commission has suggested that the mRNA vaccines should be administered to older and more fragile patients, while the Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) vaccine should be reserved for younger subjects above the age of 18. The near future looks bright: there are tens of other vaccines undergoing clinical and preclinical validation, whose preliminary results look promising. The high mortality of CKD and dialysis patients contracting Covid-19 should mandate top priority for their vaccination.","Sciarrone Alibrandi, Maria Teresa; Vespa, Marta; Joli, Giancarlo; Bucci, Romina; Brioni, Elena; Rivera, Rodolfo F",Giornale italiano di nefrologia : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di nefrologia,555,8

Little is known about how these changes affected academic stress in students. This study examined the role of changes of teaching methods on academic stress among university students during the first lockdown in Denmark. METHODS The cross-sectional survey was part of the international ""COVID-19 International Student Well-being Study"" and included responses on socio-economic characteristics, infection worries, academic stress, work capacity and satisfaction with teaching from 1,541 Danish health and medical science university students in May-June 2020. Changes in academic stress were analysed using descriptive statistics and multi-variable analyses using stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS A considerable part (39%) of students reported academic stress due to COVID-19. One third reported that their study workload had increased significantly due to the COVID-19 outbreak and that they were concerned about their ability to complete the academic year. Factors associated with academic stress were female sex, young age, bachelor level, knowing a COVID-19 patient and being worried about becoming infected, whereas immigration background, sufficient financial resources and living arrangements were not. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 outbreak has influenced university students' academic stress.

In infants and young children, rotaviruses are the single most important aetiological agents of acute gastroenteritis in terms of numbers of cases and also of patients requiring admission to hospital. In older children and adults, the aetiology is less clear, but the present state of our knowledge indicates that Norwalk-like viruses are one of the major causes. Most of these gastroenteritis-producing viruses cannot be propagated satisfactorily in laboratory cell-culture systems, and electron microscopy is the chief method of detection. Immune electron microscopy is used to demonstrate specific antibody increases during infection and to show antigenic differences between morphologically similar viruses.

In addition, clinical trials on the efficacy of antiviral therapies in the management of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have also been reviewed, in order to identify potential treatment options for COVID-19. Method An extensive search was performed in Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and CENTRAL databases until the end of March 15, 2020. Two independent researchers performed the screening, and finally the related studies were included. Results Only one clinical trial on the efficacy of antiviral therapy in management of COVID-19 was found. The results depicted that adding Lopinavir-Ritonavir to the standard treatment regimen of patients with severe COVID-19 has no benefits. Moreover, 21 case-series and case-report studies reported the prescription of antiviral agents in COVID-19, none of which can be used to determine the efficacy of antiviral therapies in confronting COVID-19. In addition, no clinical trials were found to be performed on the efficacy of antiviral agents in the management of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Conclusion The current evidence impede researchers from proposing an appropriate antiviral therapy against COVID-19, making the current situation a serious concern for international organizations such as World Health Organization (WHO). In the time of the current pandemic and future epidemics, organizations such as WHO should pursue more proactive actions and plan well-designed clinical trials so that their results can be used in managing future epidemics.","Yousefifard, Mahmoud; Zali, Alireza; Mohamed Ali, Kosar; Madani Neishaboori, Arian; Zarghi, Afshin; Hosseini, Mostafa; Safari, Saeed",Archives of academic emergency medicine,555,23

Since the early 1990s, the annual number of diagnoses of perinatally acquired AIDS and HIV infection has declined by approximately 90% in the United States as a result of routine HIV screening of pregnant women and the availability of effective interventions to prevent transmission. To characterize the most recent trends in diagnoses of perinatal HIV infection by race/ethnicity, CDC analyzed national HIV surveillance data for the period 2004-2007 from 34 states. This report summarizes the results of those analyses, which indicated that, during 2004-2007, 85% of diagnoses of perinatal HIV infection were in blacks or African Americans (69%) or Hispanics or Latinos (16%). The average annual rate of diagnoses of perinatal HIV infection during 2004-2007 was 12.3 per 100,000 among blacks, 2.1 per 100,000 among Hispanics, and 0.5 per 100,000 among whites. However, from 2004 to 2007, the racial/ethnic disparity narrowed, as the annual rate of diagnoses of perinatal HIV infection for black children decreased from 14.8 to 10.2 per 100,000, and the rate for Hispanic children decreased from 2.9 to 1.7 per 100,000.

We recently described the construction of recombinant human adenovirus type 5 (hAd5) carrying the BCV haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene in the early transcription region 3 of the adenovirus genome. In this study, we examined the induction of systemic and mucosal immune responses to the hAd5 vector carrying the BCV HE gene (AdBcHE) following intranasal or enteric immunization of cotton rats. Regardless of the route of administration, mucosal immunization with AdBcHE induced significant levels of anti-HE IgG antibodies in serum. In addition, following intranasal immunization with AdBcHE, significant levels of anti-HE IgA antibodies were found in lung washes of immunized cotton rats. Furthermore, the specific anti-HE antibodies in sera and mucosal secretions efficiently neutralized BCV infectivity in vitro. T-cell proliferation and cell-mediated cytotoxic responses against the BCV HE were elicited in the spleen of intranasally immunized animals. The results demonstrate that mucosal immunization with AdBcHE is capable of inducing both systemic and mucosal immunity to the BCV HE. These immune responses may be important in protecting animals from BCV infection.","Baca-Estrada, M E; Liang, X; Babiuk, L A; Yoo, D",Immunology,555,20

However, infection with COVID-19 may also involve the central nervous system (CNS), which may or may not be due to a multi-organ injury. Our aim in this paper is to briefly summarize the main aspects of the growing literature on neurological manifestations of the COVID-19 infection. As such, after mentioning some general background on the economic and medical implications of the pandemic on individuals, the healthcare system, and the society, we summarize some common aspects of the published literature on neurological manifestations of the COVID-19 infection. We also highlight the existing gaps in the literature, which requires additional work. The most common neurological manifestation of COVID-19 infection is an olfactory deficit. However, it is still unknown if it is inflammatory or degenerative in nature. Still, the incidence of neurological complications, and also their mechanisms and treatments are unknown. This literature is predominantly composed of opinions and reviews rather than original articles, so the patients' data are not used for a majority of the studies. Multi-center studies that not only conduct chest CT or MRI but also brain CT or MRI are needed. Randomized trials are still required on the management of acute and chronic neurological conditions due to COVID-19 infection. Cohort studies may also determine the natural history of the conditions and factors that are prognostic. Furthermore, while disparities in COVID-19 infections are known, inequalities in neurological manifestations are unknown. Besides this, the efficacy of specific treatments on CNS involvement is still unknown. We will discuss the health care needs of patients with chronic neurological conditions.

DESIGN Retrospective observational research. METHOD We compared prevalences of ED visits from the Dutch Injury Surveillance System (DISS) between the period of semi-lockdown (16 March-10 May 2020) and the same period in 2019. The same comparisons were made for the period of relaxation of measures (11 May-5 July 2020) and for the period of relaxation versus lockdown. To eliminate a possible effect of avoiding emergency care, analyses were performed on severe injury related ED-visits. RESULTS The prevalence of severe injury related ED-visits during the period of lockdown was 27 percent lower compared to the same period in 2019 (6.755 versus 4.902, P<0.05). This decrease was observed for all types of injuries and age groups, but was strongest for sports injuries (-53%) and among 10-19-year-olds (-55%). In contrast, the number of ED-visits increased after accidents with jobs in the house (+31%) and roller-skates (+223%). Among 0-11-year-olds, more accidents with trampolines were reported (+68%). During the period of relaxation, the number of severe injury related ED-visits increased with 19 percent, but was 11 percent lower compared to 2019. CONCLUSION The changes in activities following the coronavirus measures have led to changes in the number of severe injuries treated at EDs. The variations observed during the periods of lockdown and relaxation seem to be correlated with the amount of exposure in sports, traffic, stay at home and leisure activity.","Krul, Inge M; Panneman, Martien J M; Toet, Hidde; Stam, Christine; Blatter, Birgitte M",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,555,20

During this process, mRNAs are generated that represent the genomic 5' sequence, the so-called leader RNA, fused at specific positions to different 3' regions of the genome. The fusion of the leader to the mRNA bodies occurs at a short, conserved sequence element, the transcription-regulating sequence (TRS), which precedes every transcription unit in the genome and is also present at the 3' end of the leader sequence. Here, we have used site-directed mutagenesis of the infectious cDNA clone of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus to show that sg mRNA synthesis requires a base-pairing interaction between the leader TRS and the complement of a body TRS in the viral negative strand. Mutagenesis of the body TRS of equine arteritis virus RNA7 reduced sg RNA7 transcription severely or abolished it completely. Mutations in the leader TRS dramatically influenced the synthesis of all sg mRNAs. The construction of double mutants in which a mutant leader TRS was combined with the corresponding mutant RNA7 body TRS resulted in the specific restoration of mRNA7 synthesis. The analysis of the mRNA leader-body junctions of a number of mutants with partial transcriptional activity provided support for a mechanism of discontinuous minus-strand transcription that resembles similarity-assisted, copy-choice RNA recombination.","van Marle, G; Dobbe, J C; Gultyaev, A P; Luytjes, W; Spaan, W J; Snijder, E J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,555,20

Results: We reviewed 4124 published articles based on predetermined inclusion cri-teria. The author’s consensus included a total of 41 articles. Of these, 32 were in English and 9 in Farsi, published between 1975–2019. The result categorized into two distinct clinical areas: treatment (18 articles) and diagnostic (23 articles) services.

Whilst challenges for knowledge and clinical skills are being actively addressed, wider considerations such as the impact on professional identity development have been mostly neglected thus far. A robust professional identity is linked to professional behaviour and has been shown to reduce burnout and be an important factor for general practice career choice amongst medical students. The Communities of Practice Model is a sociocultural approach that conceptualises the formation of professional identity through student engagement within a community. We argue the current suspension of clinical placements holds the potential to negatively influence such identity acquisition. In this commentary we explore how the Communities of Practice Model may inform professional identity development of medical students within the COVID-19 environment, considering digital communities and volunteering roles within primary care. We further encourage educators and institutions to consider professional identity in future planning to address the challenges posed by the current situation, both in terms of placement loss but also changes in the way primary care is delivered. Such considerations will be essential if we are to avoid problems relating to poor medical student professional identity development in future.","Cullum, Rob J; Shaughnessy, Aaron; Mayat, Nabilah Y; Brown, Megan El",Educ Prim Care,555,24

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 471 samples collected from 371 patients (age<18 years) suspected of having severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The study group comprised 66/371 (18%) laboratory-confirmed pediatric COVID-19 patients: 61 (92.5%) patients tested positive on real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-CoV-2, and 5 (7.5%) patients tested positive on serological tests. MIS-C was diagnosed according to the criteria of the Center for Disease Control. RESULTS: MIS-C was diagnosed in 6/66 (9%) patients. The frequencies of diarrhea, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain (67% vs. 22%, p=0.034); pediatric SARS (67% vs. 13%, p=0.008); hypoxemia (83% vs. 23%, p=0.006); and arterial hypotension (50% vs. 3%, p=0.004) were significantly higher in patients with MIS-C than in those without MIS-C. The frequencies of C-reactive protein levels >50 mg/L (83% vs. 25%, p=0.008) and D-dimer levels >1000 ng/mL (100% vs. 40%, p=0.007) and the median D-dimer, troponin T, and ferritin levels (p<0.05) were significantly higher in patients with MIS-C. The frequencies of pediatric intensive care unit admission (100% vs. 60%, p=0.003), mechanical ventilation (83% vs. 7%, p<0.001), vasoactive agent use (83% vs. 3%, p<0.001), shock (83% vs. 5%, p<0.001), cardiac abnormalities (100% vs. 2%, p<0.001), and death (67% vs. 3%, p<0.001) were also significantly higher in patients with MIS-C. Similarly, the frequencies of oxygen therapy (100% vs. 33%, p=0.003), intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (67% vs. 2%, p<0.001), aspirin therapy (50% vs. 0%, p<0.001), and current acute renal replacement therapy (50% vs. 2%, p=0.002) were also significantly higher in patients with MIS-C. Logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of MIS-C was significantly associated with gastrointestinal manifestations [odds ratio (OR)=10.98; 95%CI (95% confidence interval)=1.20-100.86; p=0.034] and hypoxemia [OR=16.85; 95%CI=1.34-211.80; p=0.029]. Further univariate analysis showed a positive association between MIS-C and death [OR=58.00; 95%CI=6.39-526.79; p<0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with MIS-C had a severe clinical spectrum with a high mortality rate. Our study emphasizes the importance of investigating MIS-C in pediatric patients with COVID-19 presenting with gastrointestinal involvement and hypoxemia.","Pereira, Maria Fernanda Badue; Litvinov, Nadia; Farhat, Sylvia Costa Lima; Eisencraft, Adriana Pasmanik; Gibelli, Maria Augusta Bento Cicaroni; Carvalho, Werther Brunow de; Fernandes, Vinicius Rodrigues; Fink, Thais de Toledo; Framil, Juliana Valéria de Souza; Galleti, Karine Vusberg; Fante, Alice Lima; Fonseca, Maria Fernanda Mota; Watanabe, Andreia; Paula, Camila Sanson Yoshino de; Palandri, Giovanna Gavros; Leal, Gabriela Nunes; Diniz, Maria de Fatima Rodrigues; Pinho, João Renato Rebello; Silva, Clovis Artur; Marques, Heloisa Helena de Sousa; Rossi Junior, Alfio; Delgado, Artur Figueiredo; Andrade, Anarella Penha Meirelles de; Schvartsman, Claudio; Sabino, Ester Cerdeira; Rocha, Mussya Cisotto; Kanunfre, Kelly Aparecida; Okay, Thelma Suely; Carneiro-Sampaio, Magda Maria Sales; Jorge, Patricia Palmeira Daenekas",Clinics (Sao Paulo),555,22

Due to a national compulsive decree of quarantine, office visits for chronic disease control were delay. Hypopituitarism includes all clinical conditions that result in partial or complete failure of the pituitary gland's ability to secrete hormones. Pituitary insufficiency per se has been associated with an increase in both morbidity and mortality, particularly due to cardiovascular disease, which is an important risk factor for COVID-19 disease severity. OBJECTIVE: To report the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient with hypopituitarism, discuss the implications of the treatments the patient was taking and grade up the value of telemedicine in the present scenario. METHODS: Report of the clinical record of a patient with hypopituitarism and infection with SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: During the span of the infection, the patient remained on the same hormonal therapeutic scheme (thyroid, gonadal and adrenal axis). The dose of hydrocortisone was not changed during the course of the infection as she was asymptomatic. We use telemedicine to control and advise her on the treatment. CONCLUSION: Health care professionals should carefully follow up on the evolution of patients with hypopituitarism to provide them a safer outcome. The use of telemedicine as a methodology for selected patients acquires relevance in the present epidemiological context.","Fux Otta, Carolina; Moreno, Laura; Vitaloni, Roberto; Iraci, Gabriel S",Rev Fac Cien Med Univ Nac Cordoba,555,20

However, no studies have been carried out to investigate cumulative nature, patterns, and causative factors of such suicide incidences. METHODS: A purposive sampling of Google news between 15 February and 6 July was performed. After excluding duplicate reports, the final list comprised a total of 37-suicide cases across 11 countries. FINDINGS: More male suicides were reported (21-cases, i.e., 56.76%), and the mean age of the total victims was 16.6 ± 2.7 years (out of a total of 29 cases). About two-thirds of the suicides were from three countries named India (11-cases), UK (8-cases), and the USA (6-cases). Out of 23-student victims, 14 were school-going students. Hanging was the most common suicide method accounting in 51.4% of cases. The most common suicide causalities were related to mental sufferings such as depression, loneliness, psychological distress, and so forth, whereas either online schooling or overwhelming academic distress was placed as the second most suicide stressors followed by TikTok addiction-related psychological distress, and tested with the COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of the temporal distribution of suicides concerning lockdowns may help in exploring and evolving public measures to prevent/decrease pandemic-related suicides in young people.","Manzar, Md Dilshad; Albougami, Abdulrhman; Usman, Norina; Mamun, Mohammed A",J Child Adolesc Psychiatr Nurs,555,21

However, recent serological survey reported that several percent of population showed IgG positive to SARS-CoV-2. Specificity in the assays might influence the estimate, and possibility of overdiagnosis should be investigated. Serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus were performed in pre-COVID-19 sera in Japan (400 healthy subjects in 2012-2015). Lateral flow assay (LFA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed 1.5% (6/400) and 1.75% (7/400) IgG positives, respectively. Among those false positive samples, only one sample was positive in both LFA and ELISA (0.25%; 95% CI: 0.006-1.39%). Possible bias from pooling method was examined by Monte Carlo method and the possibility was unlikely at low false positive rate. Previous surveys might overestimate COVID-19 seroprevalence in several populations of Japan. These false positives could be excluded by combination of different diagnostics.

The aim of this minireview is to present epidemiological data related to metabolic comorbidities in association with the SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This is a narrative mini-review with Pubmed search until April 23, 2020 using the keywords COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, treatment of coronavirus and following terms: diabetes mellitus, obesity, arterial hypertension, ACE-inhibitors, cytokine storm, immune response and vitamin D. RESULTS: Studies indicate that obese individuals are more likely to develop infections, and that adipose tissue serves as a pathogen reservoir. In diabetic individuals higher rate of inflammatory processes is seen due to constant glucose recognition by C type lectin receptors. Hypertensive individuals, usually grouped with other conditions, are treated with drugs to reduce blood pressure mostly through ACEi and ARB, that leads to increased ACE2 expression, used by SARS-CoV-2 for human's cell entry. Until now, the studies have shown that individuals with those conditions and affected by COVID-19 present an uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an unbalanced immune response, leading to the cytokine storm phenomenon. Vitamin D is highlighted as a potential therapeutic target, because in addition to acting on the immune system, it plays an important role in the control of cardiometabolic diseases. CONCLUSION: Currently, since there is no proven and effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2, the efforts should focus on controlling inflammatory response and reduce the risks of associated complications.","de Lucena, Thays Maria Costa; da Silva Santos, Ariane Fernandes; de Lima, Brenda Regina; de Albuquerque Borborema, Maria Eduarda; de Azevêdo Silva, Jaqueline",Diabetes Metab Syndr,555,20

This study aims to assess the association between lockdown due to COVID-19 and online searches for toothache in Iran using Google Trends (GT). METHODS: We investigated GT online searches for toothache within the past five years. The time frame for data gathering was considered as the initiation and end dates of the national lockdown in Iran. We performed one-way ANOVA statistical test to compare relative search volumes (RSVs) between the year 2020 and 2016-2019 for the whole country. Then we investigated the possible association of RSVs in provinces with dentists' density, prevalence of current daily smokers, Human Development Index (HDI), Internet access, and fluoride concentration in water using linear regression. RESULTS: When comparing 2020 with the previous four years, there was a rise of 2020 RSVs versus all previous years combined and each year (P < 0.001 for all of them). In the linear model for the year 2020, HDI (B = - 3.29, 95% CI: (- 5.80, - 0.78), P = 0.012) had a strong negative relationship with provincial RSVs. HDI mostly had strong positive relationship with provincial RSVs in prior years. Fluoride concentration (B = - 0.13, 95% CI: (- 0.24, - 0.03), P = 0.017) and dentists' density (B = - 0.04, 95% CI: (- 0.25, 0.17), P = 0.669) were also negatively associated with RSVs in 2020.

METHODS: A prospective observational single-center study was performed, including all antenatal and parturient women admitted from April to August 2020. Data were collected regarding number of admissions, deliveries, antenatal visits, reason for inaccessibility of health care, and complications during pregnancy, and compared with data from the pre-COVID period of October 2019 to February 2020. RESULTS: There was a reduction of 45.1% in institutional deliveries (P<0.001), a percentage point increase of 7.2 in high-risk pregnancy, and 2.5-fold rise in admission to the intensive care unit of pregnant women during the pandemic. One-third of women had inadequate antenatal visits. The main reason for delayed health-seeking was lockdown and fear of contracting infection, resulting in 44.7% of pregnancies with complications. Thirty-two symptomatic women who tested positive for COVID-19 were managed at the center with good maternal and fetal outcomes.

The aim of our study was to validate the Total Severity Score (TSS), Chest Computed Tomography Score (CT-S), and Chest CT Severity Score (CT-SS) scales, which were used to assess the extent of lung inflammation in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in terms of interobserver agreement and the correlation of scores with patient clinical condition on the day of the study. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 77 chest CT scans collected from 77 consecutive patients hospitalized because of SARS-CoV-2 were included. The scans were assessed independently by 2 radiologists aware of the patients' positive results of RT-PCR tests. Each chest CT was assessed according to the 3 scales. To assess the interobserver agreement of CT scan assessments, Cohen's k and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were calculated. RESULTS For the overall assessment, the k was 0.944 and the ICC was 0.948 for the TSS; the kappa was 0.909 and the ICC was 0.919 for the CT-S; and the k was 0.888 and the ICC was 0.899 for the CT-SS. The CT-SS (r=0.627 for Radiologist 1 and r=0.653 for Radiologist 2) revealed the strongest positive correlation with the patient clinical condition as expressed using the Modified Early Warning Score. CONCLUSIONS The interobserver agreement for the 3 evaluated scales was very good. The CT-SS was found to have the strongest positive relationship with the Modified Early Warning Score.","Mruk, Bartosz; Plucinska, Dominika; Walecki, Jerzy; Póltorak-Szymczak, Gabriela; Sklinda, Katarzyna",Med Sci Monit,555,20

METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional study to explore ICU nurses' willingness to provide care during the COVID-19 pandemic was undertaken between 25 March and 3 April 2020 at a large principal and referral teaching hospital in Sydney, NSW Australia. RESULTS: A total of 83 ICU nurses completed the survey. Approximately 60% reported receiving sufficient information from managers regarding COVID-19 and about caring for a patient with COVID-19. Ninety percent of nurses were concerned about spreading COVID-19 to their family. Sixty one percent of the nurses indicated that they were willing to care for patients with COVID-19. Receiving timely communication from managers was the only predictor of willingness to care among ICU nurses. CONCLUSIONS: Effective communication is a vital component during a public health emergency in order to promote nurses' willingness to care for patients in the ICU.","Lord, Heidi; Loveday, Clare; Moxham, Lorna; Fernandez, Ritin",Intensive Crit Care Nurs,555,1

Such reactions are instantaneous and yet complex, as they rely on factors that go beyond interpreting the factual content the news headline. Instead, understanding reactions require pragmatic understanding of the news headline, including broader background knowledge about contentious news topics as well as commonsense reasoning about people's intents and emotional reactions. We propose Misinfo Reaction Frames, a pragmatic formalism for modeling how readers might react to a news headline cognitively, emotionally, and behaviorally. We also introduce a Misinfo Reaction Frames corpus, a dataset of over 200k news headline annotated with crowdsourced reactions focusing on global crises: the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, and cancer. Empirical results confirm that it is indeed possible to learn the prominent patterns of readers' reactions to news headlines. We also find a potentially positive use case of our model; When we present our model generated inferences to people, we find that the machine inferences can increase readers' trust in real news while decreasing their trust in misinformation. Our work demonstrates the feasibility and the importance of pragmatic inferences of news to help enhance AI-guided misinformation detection and mitigation.","Gabriel, Saadia; Hallinan, Skyler; Sap, Maarten; Nguyen, Pemi; Roesner, Franziska; Choi, Eunsol; Choi, Yejin",,555,20

The disease, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, is primarily a respiratory condition that can affect numerous other bodily systems including the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. The disease ranges in severity from asymptomatic through to severe acute respiratory distress requiring intensive care treatment and mechanical ventilation, which can lead to respiratory failure and death. It has rapidly become evident that COVID-19 patients can develop features of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, which in many cases persist for as long as we have thus far been able to follow the patients. Many questions remain about how such fibrotic changes occur within the lung of COVID-19 patients, whether the changes will persist long term or are capable of resolving, and whether post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis has the potential to become progressive, as in other fibrotic lung diseases.

The aim of the study is to analyze the validity of SARS-CoV-2 swabs taken preoperatively under suboptimal conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective comparison of the PCR results of SARS-CoV-2 swaps taken preoperatively and intraoperatively from 62 children in the period from April to November 2020. Median age was 4.49 years. The PCR diagnosis was carried out one or two days preoperatively (in the case of emergency interventions on the same day) and again intraoperatively using a pooled nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: All 62 preoperatively taken swabs were negative. Deviating from the preoperative test result, one intraoperatively obtained swab was positive. CONCLUSIONS: Due to limited compliance, a correct preoperative swab technique (preanalytics) cannot always be assumed for children. Sufficient protective measures for everyone present in the operating room are therefore imperative. Intraoperative test should be considered if the the preoperative test was performed under difficult conditions.","Zaubitzer, Lena; Ludwig, Sonja; Jungbauer, Frederic; Walter, Beatrice; Lange, Bettina; Rotter, Nicole; Schell, Angela",Laryngorhinootologie,555,16

METHODS: Three hundred and fourteen patients presented with clinically suspected COVID-19, from March 3 to 23, 2020, were evaluated with PaO2/FIO2 ratio from arterial blood gas, RT-PCR assay from nasopharyngeal swab sample and chest CT. Patients were classified as COVID-19 negative and COVID-19 positive according to RT-PCR results, considered as a reference. Images were independently evaluated by two radiologists blinded to the RT-PCR results and classified as ""CT positive"" or ""CT negative"" for COVID-19, according to CT findings. RESULTS: According to RT-PCR results, 152 patients were COVID-19 negative (48%) and 162 were COVID-19 positive (52%). We found substantial agreement between RT-PCR results and CT findings (p < 0.000001), as well as an almost perfect agreement between the two readers. Mixed GGO and consolidation pattern with peripheral and bilateral distribution, multifocal or diffuse abnormalities localized in both upper lung and lower lung, in association with interlobular septal thickening, bronchial wall thickening and air bronchogram, showed higher frequency in COVID-positive patients. We also found a significant correlation between CT findings and patient's oxygenation status expressed by PaO2/FIO2 ratio. CONCLUSION: Chest CT has a useful role in the early detection and in patient management of COVID-19 pneumonia in a pandemic. It helps in identifying suspected patients, cutting off the route of transmission and avoiding further spread of infection.","Gaia, Cartocci; Maria Chiara, Colaiacomo; Silvia, Lanciotti; Chiara, Andreoli; Maria Luisa, De Cicco; Giulia, Brachetti; Silvia, Pugliese; Lucia, Capoccia; Alessandra, Tortora; Annarita, Scala; Cristina, Valentini; Maria, Almberger; Maria Rosaria, D039; Aprile,; Giacinta, Avventurieri; Riccardo, Giura; Zaher, Kharrub; Andrea, Leonardi; Maddalena, Boccia; Catalano, Carlo; Paolo, Ricci",Radiol Med,555,16

Methods: The study was performed in the context of health surveillance at the workplaces. We monitored the SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 symptoms among HCWs classified by having received the entire vaccine schedule or not; the latter further classified in not vaccinated workers and workers who had received the first shot more than 14 days earlier. The SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by conventional RT-PCR on rhino-pharyngeal swabs, followed by gene sequencing in positive vaccinated HCWs. The cumulative incidence of infections in the period was normalised to 100,000 people. Results: At the end of the observation period, HCWs that had completed the full schedule were at lower infection risk than both unvaccinated HCWs and the workforce who had not yet gained the complete theoretical protection from the vaccine (by 2.4-folds). Overall, ninety-two SARS-CoV-2 infections were observed among HCWs, mostly among not protected workers (52 cases) but none of them showed symptoms requiring hospitalisation. Conclusions: The vaccination campaign effectively reduced the appearance of symptoms and the incidence of infections among vaccinated HCWs. Among vaccinated HCWs, gene sequencing was possible in five cases only, 4 B.1.1.7 and 1 B1.525 variants. The high rate of unsuccessful gene sequencing observed among infected vaccinated workers could be explained by a low viral burden. Vaccination for COVID-19 should be mandatory in occupational settings with a high infective risk.","Sansone, Emanuele; Sala, Emma; Tiraboschi, Mara; Albini, Elisa; Lombardo, Massimo; Indelicato, Annamaria; Rosati, Cristina; Boniotti, Maria Beatrice; Castelli, Francesco; De Palma, Giuseppe",Med Lav,555,1

This disease has a spectrum of different clinical pictures with different outcomes. Herein, we report all the data from three paucisymptomatic patients during a hospital stay that might represent a paradigmatic example of the method by which SARS-CoV-2 is shed. We demonstrated the lack of an adequate qualitative and quantitative immune response by multiparametric flow cytometry analysis. Our data can provide a new perspective about the method by which SARS-CoV-2 is shed and the clinical weight of viral persistence. In all three cases, the long persistence of the virus and the consistent reduction in both innate and adaptative immune cells are not associated with greater disease severity. These patients might represent at least part of the population. In particular, one patient oscillated between positive and negative swab tests several times without presenting any immune response. In all three cases, the immune response failure was not associated with a clinically significant involvement, indicating that it is not the virus's ability to impair the immune system, as well as its presence and persistence the fundamental mechanism that might causally lead to death. Finally, this kind of immune response in paucisymptomatic patients could pose a considerable danger to public health that questions the quarantine period. It is urgent to quantify the phenomenon with a large sample study.","Corrao, Salvatore; Gervasi, Francesco; Di Bernardo, Francesca; Argano, Christiano",Clin Pract,555,26

Objective: Our aim was to investigate the impact of COVID‐19 in terms of risks of infection, hospitalization and mortality in a cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis (PSO) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Furthermore, we studied the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection on the prescribed drug regimen in these patients. Methods: Through the record linkage between health information systems, a cohort of patients, ≥18 years old, assisted in the Lazio region and who had suffered from immune‐mediated inflammatory diseases (RA, PSO, IBD) between 2007 and 2019, was identified. The risk of infection, hospitalization or mortality for COVID‐19, was assessed by logistic regression models, and reported in an Odds Ratio (ORs;CI 95%), adjusting for sex, age and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. We also estimated these risks separately by IMID and in the subgroup of prevalent biologic drug users. We investigated deferral of biological treatments in the study population by comparing the prevalence of weekly use of biologicals (2019–2020) before and during the pandemic periods. Findings: Within the 65,230 patients with IMIDs, the cumulative incidence for COVID‐19 was 303/10,000 ab. In this cohort of patients, we observed a significantly higher risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection than the general population: OR = 1.17 (95% CI 1.12–1.22). The risk was higher even considering separately each disease and in the subgroup of prevalent biologic drug users. This last subgroup of patients showed a higher risk of death related to COVID‐19 (OR 1.89;95% CI 1.04–3.33) than the general population. However, no differences in terms of risks of hospitalization or death related to COVID‐19 were recorded in patients with the IMIDs. Comparing the 2019–2020 prevalence of weekly biological drug treatments in prevalent biologic drug users, we found a decrease (−19.6%) during the lockdown, probably due to pandemic restrictions. Conclusions and Relevance: Patients with IMIDs seem to have a higher risk of SARS‐CoV2 infection. However, other than for patients with prevalent biologic drug treatment, no significant differences in terms of hospitalization and mortality were reported compared to the general populations;further investigation is warranted on account of unmeasured confounding. In addition, during the lockdown period, the COVID‐19 emergency highlighted a lower use of biologic drugs;this phenomenon requires strict pharmacological monitoring as it could be a proxy of forthcoming long-term clinical progression.","Belleudi, V.; Rosa, A.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the levels of vitamin D and severity of COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 204 patients with COVID-19 disease were enrolled in the study. All patients had viral pneumonia, which was confirmed with chest computer tomography. All cases were divided in two groups- mild (outpatients); and serious (inpatients)- according to their clinical and laboratory data. Serum vitamin D levels were measured by chemiluminescence method. RESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency was found in 41.7 % (n = 85) of cases and insufficiency was found in 46.0 % (n = 94), while in 12.3 % (n = 25) of cases normal vitamin D levels were found.

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic drove the need for rapid vaccine production applying a novel antigen delivery system: messenger RNA vaccines packaged in lipid nanoparticles. Unexpectedly, public vaccine administration led to a small number of severe allergic reactions, with resultant substantial public concern, especially within atopic individuals. We reviewed the constituents of the messenger RNA lipid nanoparticle vaccine and considered several contributors to these reactions: (1) contact system activation by nucleic acid, (2) complement recognition of the vaccine-activating allergic effector cells, (3) preexisting antibody recognition of polyethylene glycol, a lipid nanoparticle surface hydrophilic polymer, and (4) direct mast cell activation, coupled with potential genetic or environmental predispositions to hypersensitivity. Unfortunately, measurement of anti-polyethylene glycol antibodies in vitro is not clinically available, and the predictive value of skin testing to polyethylene glycol components as a coronavirus disease 2019 messenger RNA vaccine-specific anaphylaxis marker is unknown. Even less is known regarding the applicability of vaccine use for testing (in vitro/vivo) to ascertain pathogenesis or predict reactivity risk. Expedient and thorough research-based evaluation of patients who have suffered anaphylactic vaccine reactions and prospective clinical trials in putative at-risk individuals are needed to address these concerns during a public health crisis.","Risma, Kimberly A; Edwards, Kathryn M; Hummell, Donna S; Little, Frederic F; Norton, Allison E; Stallings, Amy; Wood, Robert A; Milner, Joshua D",J. allergy clin. immunol,555,20

While preliminary research across the globe has shown NPI policy to be effective, there is currently a lack of information on NPI effectiveness in the United States. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to create a granular NPI dataset at the county level and then analyze the relationship between NPI policies and changes in reported COVID-19 cases. METHODS: Using a standardized crowdsourcing methodology, we collected time series data on seven key NPIs for 1,320 U.S. counties. RESULTS: This open source dataset is the largest and most comprehensive county NPI policy dataset and meets the need for higher resolution COVID-19 policy data. Our analysis revealed a wide variation in county-level policies both within and among states (P < .001). We identified a correlation between workplace closures and lower growth rates of COVID-19 cases (P = .004). We found weak correlations between shelter-in-place enforcement and measures of Democratic local voter proportion (R = 0.21) and elected leadership (R = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first large-scale NPI analysis at the county level demonstrating a correlation between NPIs and decreased rates of COVID-19. Future work using this dataset will explore the relationship between county-level policies and COVID-19 transmission to optimize real-time policy formulation.","Ebrahim, Senan; Ashworth, Henry; Noah, Cray; Kadambi, Adesh; Toumi, Asmae; Chhatwal, Jagpreet",J. med. internet res,555,26

SARS-CoV-2 infects host human cells by binding through the viral spike proteins to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, fuses with the cell membrane, enters and starts its replication process in order to multiply its viral load. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was initially considered a respiratory infection that could cause pneumonia. However, in severe cases, it extends beyond the respiratory system and becomes a multi-organ disease. This transition from localized respiratory infection to multi-organ disease is due to two main complications of COVID-19. On the one hand, the so-called cytokine storm: an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction of the immune system in which defensive molecules become aggressive for the body itself. On the other hand, the formation of a large number of thrombi that can cause myocardial infarction, stroke and pulmonary embolism (PE). The pulmonary endothelium actively participates in these two processes, becoming the last barrier before the virus spreads throughout the body. In this review, we examine the role of the pulmonary endothelium in response to COVID-19, the existence of potential biomarkers and the development of novel therapies to restore vascular homeostasis and to protect/treat these patients. Additionally, we review the thrombotic complications recently observed in COVID-19 patients and its potential threatening sequelae.

Interestingly, antibodies to Spike showed better longevity whereas their neutralization ability contracted faster. As a result, neutralizing antibodies were detected in only 76% of patients at the last time point. In a multivariate analysis, older age and hospitalization were independently associated with higher Spike, Spike-RBD, Nucleocapsid, N-RBD antibodies and neutralizing antibody levels.

With the experience of improved and discharged COVID-19 patients, timely respiratory rehabilitation intervention may improve prognosis, maximize functional preservation and improve quality of life (QoL), but there lacks of studies worldwide exploring the outcome of this intervention. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of 6-week respiratory rehabilitation training on respiratory function, QoL, mobility and psychological function in elderly patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This paper reported the findings of an observational, prospective, quasi-experimental study, which totally recruited 72 participants, of which 36 patients underwent respiratory rehabilitation and the rest without any rehabilitation intervention. The following outcomes were measured: pulmonary function tests including plethysmography and diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), functional tests (6-min walk distance test), Quality of life (QoL) assessments (SF-36 scores), activities of daily living (Functional Independence Measure, FIM scores), and mental status tests (SAS anxiety and SDS depression scores). RESULTS: After 6 weeks of respiratory rehabilitation in the intervention group, there disclosed significant differences in FEV1(L), FVC(L), FEV1/FVC%, DLCO% and 6-min walk test. The SF-36 scores, in 8 dimensions, were statistically significant within the intervention group and between the two groups. SAS and SDS scores in the intervention group decreased after the intervention, but only anxiety had significant statistical significance within and between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Six-week respiratory rehabilitation can improve respiratory function, QoL and anxiety of elderly patients with COVID-19, but it has little significant improvement on depression in the elderly.","Liu, Kai; Zhang, Weitong; Yang, Yadong; Zhang, Jinpeng; Li, Yunqian; Chen, Ying",Complement Ther Clin Pract,555,20

In the line of therapeutic options for SARS and MERS, this study aims to summarize the current clinical evidence of treatment options for COVID-19. In general, the combination of antibiotics, ribavirin, and corticosteroids was considered as a standard treatment for patients with SARS. The addition of this conventional treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon, and convalescent plasma showed potential clinical improvement. For patients with MERS, ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon, and convalescent plasma were continuously recommended. However, a high-dose of corticosteroid was suggested for severe cases only. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir and convalescent plasma was commonly reported. There was limited evidence for the effect of corticosteroids, other antiviral drugs like ribavirin, and favipiravir. Monoclonal antibody of tocilizumab and antimalarial agents of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were also introduced. Among antibiotics for infection therapy, azithromycin was suggested.

Moreover, sensitivity analysis indicates that an increasing contact rate may lead to a second wave of disease outbreak. We also investigate the effectiveness of disease intervention strategies. Simulations demonstrate that enlarging the testing capacity and motivating infected individuals to test for an early diagnosis may facilitate mitigating the disease spread in a relatively short time. Results also indicate a significantly faster decline of confirmed positive cases if individuals practice strict physical distancing even if restricted measures are lifted.","Wang, Xiaoying",Math Biosci Eng,555,14

This article focuses on school education within the context of Covid-19 and asks a fundamental curriculum question around what knowledge is most worthwhile for school education in response to this disease. Schools within South Africa have been closed for an extended period and, within the guidelines for dealing with this infectious disease, social distancing has become a key component in determining how and when schools should reopen. This uncertainty has led to speculations, suggestions, proposals and tentative plans for a school recovery plan to save the integrity of the academic year. The article reviews some of the suggestions, proposals, and plans, which illuminate a technical concern of curriculum coverage rather than a curriculum concern of what learning should be pursued post the lockdown period. It also argues that, going forward, a review of the purpose of school is needed. If learning is the bedrock for determining a school curriculum, it should of necessity be relevant and responsive to the issues and challenges of the country within a global world.","Ramrathan, Labby",Prospects (Paris),555,1

In this study, eighty-eight reported COVID-19 patients in Wuhan were recruited from January to February, 2020, including 32 severe/critical cases and 56 mild/moderate cases. Their mean age was 56.43 years (range 17-83) and gender ratio (male/female) was 43:45. We tested SARS-CoV-2 RNA with commercial kits, investigated the level of serologic IgM and IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using magnetic particle chemiluminescence immunoassays, and compared the results of serologic tests and nucleic acid test (NAT). Among 88 patients, 95.45% were confirmed as positive by the combination of NAT and antibody test, which was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than by single nucleic acid test (73.86%) or serologic test (65.91%). Then the correlation between temporal profile and the level of antibody response was analyzed. It showed that seroconversion started on day 5 after disease onset and IgG level was rose earlier than IgM. Comparison between patients with different disease severity suggested early seroconversion and high antibody titer were linked with less severe clinical symptoms. These results supported the combination of serologic testing and NAT in routine COVID-19 diagnosis and provided evidence on the temporal profile of antibody response in patients with different disease severity.","Kong, Wen-Hua; Zhao, Rong; Zhou, Jun-Bo; Wang, Fang; Kong, De-Guang; Sun, Jian-Bin; Ruan, Qiong-Fang; Liu, Man-Qing",Virol. sin.

The presence of a huge inflammatory response, defined as ""cytokine storm,"" is being studied in order to understand what might be the prognostic factors implicated in the progression of the infection, with ferritin being one of such markers. The role of ferritin as a marker of inflammation is already known, and whether it changes differently between COVID and non-COVID patients still remains unclear. The aim of this retrospective analysis is to understand whether the inflammatory process in these two types is different. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, we compared 17 patients affected by SARS-CoV-2, who had been admitted between February and April 2020 (group A) along with 30 patients admitted for acute surgical disease with SARS-CoV-2 negative swab (group B). A further subgroup of Covid negative patients with leukocytosis was compared to group A. RESULTS: In group A, the median (interquartile range) serum ferritin was 674 (1284) ng/mL, and it was double the cutoff (300 ng/mL) in 9 out of 17 (52%). The median (IQR) value of ferritin level in the total blood samples of group B was 231, and in the subgroup with leucocytosis, 149 (145). Group A showed a significantly higher ferritin median level compared to the entire group B (two-tailed Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.0001) as well as to the subgroup with leucocytosis (p < 0.0014). CONCLUSIONS: The role of iron metabolism appears to be directly involved in COVID infection. On the other hand, in the acute inflammation of patients admitted for surgery, and probably in other common phlogistic processes, iron modifications appear to be self-limited. However, our finding suggests the use of ferritin as a marker for COVID infection.","Banchini, Filippo; Cattaneo, Gaetano Maria; Capelli, Patrizio",World J Emerg Surg,555,8

In this Perspective, we argue that adipocytes and adipocyte-like cells, such as pulmonary lipofibroblasts, may play an important role in the pathogenic response to SARS-CoV-2. Expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (the functional receptor for SARS-CoV) is upregulated in adipocytes of patients with obesity and diabetes, which turns adipose tissue into a potential target and viral reservoir. This may explain why obesity and diabetes are potential comorbidities for COVID-19 infections. Similar to the recently established adipocyte-myofibroblast transition, pulmonary lipofibroblasts located in the alveolar interstitium and closely related to classical adipocytes demonstrate the ability to transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts that play an integral part of pulmonary fibrosis. This may significantly increase the severity of the local response to SARS-CoV-2 in the lung. To reduce the severity and mortality associated with COVID-19, we propose to probe for the clinical response to thiazolidinediones, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor Î³ agonists that are well-known antidiabetic drugs. Thiazolidinediones are able to stabilize lipofibroblasts in their ""inactive"" state, preventing the transition to myofibroblasts and thereby reducing the development of pulmonary fibrosis and stimulating its resolution.","Kruglikov, Ilja L; Scherer, Philipp E",Obesity (Silver Spring),555,20

We aimed to find whether the characteristics of dental care provided to children at the Department of Pediatric Dentistry at Hadassah medical center, Jerusalem, Israel, differed between the periods, before COVID-19 outbreak, during the lockdown period and during the period that followed it. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed computerized records of patients who visited the pediatric dental clinic at three different periods: pre-lockdown period, lockdown period, and post-lockdown period. Results: Nine-hundred and forty-nine children were included in the study; most of them were healthy children between 3 and 6 years old. During lockdown, all scheduled appointments except for treatments under general anesthesia and deep sedation were canceled due to the government's restrictions; the frequency of treatments with non-pharmacological behavior management, general anesthesia or deep sedation was higher than in the previous or subsequent periods and the use of inhaled/conscious sedation was significantly lower. During lockdown most of the children were diagnosed with dentoalveolar abscess (32.3%), compared to 14 and 21% at the previous or subsequent periods, respectively (P < 0.001). Treatments combination during lockdown included more extractions, pulpectomies and pulp extirpation and less permanent restorations (P < 0.001). None of the staff members was infected with COVID-19 at the clinic during these periods. We concluded that dentists should be updated about Covid-19 modes of transmission and the recommended infection control measures in dental settings.

The program combines epidemiological modelling and surveillance (Target); fast and frequent testing using a novel and FDA Emergency Use Authorized low-cost and scalable saliva-based RT-qPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 that bypasses RNA extraction, called covidSHIELD (Test); and digital tools that communicate test results, notify of potential exposures, and promote compliance with public health mandates (Tell). These elements were combined with masks, social distancing, and robust education efforts. In Fall 2020, we performed more than 1,000,000 covidSHIELD tests while keeping classrooms, laboratories, and many other university activities open. Generally, our case positivity rates remained less than 0.5%, we prevented transmission from our students to our faculty and staff, and data indicate that we had no spread in our classrooms or research laboratories. During this fall semester, we had zero COVID-19-related hospitalizations or deaths amongst our university community. We also prevented transmission from our university community to the surrounding Champaign County community. Our experience demonstrates that multimodal transmission mitigation programs can enable university communities to achieve such outcomes until widespread vaccination against COVID-19 is achieved, and provides a roadmap for how future pandemics can be addressed.","Ranoa, Diana Rose E; Holland, Robin L; Alnaji, Fadi G; Green, Kelsie J; Wang, Leyi; Fredrickson, Richard L; Wang, Tong; Wong, George N; Uelmen, Johnny; Maslov, Sergei; Elbanna, Ahmed; Weiner, Zachary J; Tkachenko, Alexei V; Zhang, Hantao; Liu, Zhiru; Patel, Sanjay J; Paul, John M; Vance, Nickolas P; Gulick, Joseph G; Satheesan, Sandeep P; Galvan, Isaac J; Miller, Andrew; Grohens, Joseph; Nelson, Todd J; Stevens, Mary P; Hennessy, P.

The number of cases increased rapidly and spread to six continents. However, there is limited information on the chest computed tomography (CT) results of affected patients. Chest CT can assess the severity of COVID-19 and has sufficient sensitivity to assess changes in response to glucocorticoid therapy. OBJECTIVE: Analyze COVID-19 patients to determine the relationships of clinical characteristics, chest CT score, and levels of inflammatory mediators. METHODS: This retrospective, single-center case series of 108 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College of HUST (Wuhan, China) examined patients admitted from January 28 to February 20, 2020. Patient demographics, comorbidities, clinical findings, chest CT results, and CT scores of affected lung parenchyma were recorded. The relationships between chest CT score with levels of systemic inflammatory mediators were determined. RESULTS: All patients exhibited signs of significant systemic inflammation, including increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), procalcitonin, chest CT score, and a decreased lymphocyte (LY) count. Chest CT score had positive associations with white blood cell (WBC) count, CRP, ESR, procalcitonin, and abnormal coagulation function, and a negative association with LY count. Treatment with a glucocorticoid increased the LY count, reduced the CT score and CRP level, and improved coagulation function. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response that affects the lungs, blood, digestive system, and circulatory systems. The chest CT score is a good indicator of the extent of systemic inflammation. Glucocorticoid treatment appears to reduce systemic inflammation in these patients.","Zhang, Jie; Meng, Guangping; Li, Wei; Shi, Bingqing; Dong, Hongna; Su, Zhenzhong; Huang, Qian; Gao, Peng",Respir Res,555,20

PURPOSE: The current research asks: How well does the public's perception of such policies align with actual policies, and how well do actual versus perceived policies predict the public's mask-wearing and social distancing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic? METHODS: We conducted a preregistered cross-sectional study among 1,073 online participants who were representative of the U.S. population on age, gender, and education on Monday-Tuesday, July 20-21, 2020. We asked participants which locations they visited in the past weekend, and their mask-wearing and social distancing behaviors at each location. We also measured participants' beliefs about their state's policies on mask mandate and business opening and obtained objective measures of these policies from publicly available data. RESULTS: Perception about the existence of mask mandate was 91% accurate in states with a mask mandate but only 46% accurate in states without one. Perception of state reopening level did not correlate with policy. It was the perceived but not actual state mask mandate that positively predicted both mask-wearing and social distancing, controlling for state COVID-19 cases, demographic factors, and participants' numeracy and COVID-19 history. CONCLUSIONS: The public's perception of state-level mask mandates erred on the side of assuming there is one. Perception of reopening is almost completely inaccurate. Paradoxically, public perception that a mask mandate exists predicts preventive behaviors better than actual mandates.","Li, Meng; Colby, Helen",Ann. behav. med,555,1

Estimates of community-based CT/NG prevalence are lacking among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBM). METHODS: Respondent driven sampling was used to recruit GBM in Montréal, Canada between February 2017 and June 2018. Specimens provided from urogenital, rectal and pharyngeal sites were analyzed using nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) to detect CT/NG. Prevalence estimates of CT/NG, overall and by anatomical site were calculated. All estimates are RDS-adjusted. RESULTS: Among 1177 GBM, the prevalence of rectal, urogenital, pharyngeal and overall were respectively 2.4%, 0.4%, 0.4% and 2.8% for CT infections, and 3.1%, 0.4%, 3.5% and 5.6% for NG infections. If testing had been limited to the urogenital site, 80% and 94% of CT and NG infections, respectively, would have been missed. CONCLUSIONS: This community-based study among GBM shows that the CT prevalence was about half of that observed for NG. A large part of CT/NG infections involves only the extragenital sites, highlighting the need for systematic multisite screening regardless of symptoms. In the mist of the COVID-19 pandemic and the limited CT/NG screening capacity due to test kits shortage, it might be considered to prioritize rectal and pharyngeal CT/NG testing over urogenital testing in asymptomatic GBM.","Harvey-Lavoie, Simonne; Apelian, Herak; Labbé, Annie-Claude; Cox, Joseph; Messier-Peet, Marc; Moodie, Erica; Fourmigue, Alain; Moore, David; Lachowsky, Nathan J; Grace, Daniel; Hart, Trevor A; Jollimore, Jody; Fortin, Claude; Lambert, Gilles",Sex. transm. dis,555,24

Individuals self-collected 300 µl saliva in vials containing Darnell Rockefeller University Laboratory (DRUL) buffer and extracted RNA was assayed by RT-PCR (the DRUL saliva assay). The limit of detection was confirmed to be 1 viral copy/µl in 20 of 20 replicate extractions. Viral RNA was stable in DRUL buffer at room temperature up to seven days after sample collection, and safety studies demonstrated that DRUL buffer immediately inactivated virus at concentrations up to 2.75x106 PFU/ml. Results from SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples collected in viral transport media and assayed with a standard FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) test were highly correlated with samples placed in DRUL buffer. Direct comparison of results from 162 individuals tested by FDA EUA oropharyngeal (OP) or NP swabs with co-collected saliva samples identified four otherwise unidentified positive cases in DRUL buffer.

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All 2501 NHs who held a vaccine clinic from the first 17 states to initiate clinics as part of the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): Adjusted Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) for time in 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks after the first vaccine clinic for resident cases and deaths of COVID-19 and staff cases of COVID-19. RESULTS: Resident and staff cases trended downward in all three cohorts following the vaccine clinics.

The analysis is general, and applies to all SEIR-based models, not only those associated with COVID-19. We find that when modeling a rapidly spreading epidemic, seemingly minor differences in how latency is treated can lead to vastly different estimates of [Formula: see text].

We compared the glycaemic control of children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) at Doncaster &amp;Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals in the 12 weeks prior to the lockdown, to the 12 weeks following lockdown. Methods: HbA1c result 3 months following lockdown was compared to the last HbA1C prior to lockdown. Data from Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs), Flash Glucose Systems (FGS) and those performing Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) were compared alongside changes to patient contact that occurred. Results: In 264 patients under 20 years of age across both hospitals in the Trust, face-to-face consultations decreased (245 vs 151, 39%), and remote consultations increased (1751 vs 2269, 30%) (χ 2 p&amp;lt;0.001). Excluding those within a year of diagnosis, 122 had paired HbA1c results, and 80 had more than 70% of glucose monitoring data available. HbA1c levels decreased (67.4 mmol/mol vs 61.3 mmol/mol, p&amp;lt;0.001) and glucose monitoring data showed lower mean glucose after lockdown (9.7mmol/L vs 9.5mmol/L, p=0.034) with lower standard deviation (4.4mmol/L vs 4.2mmol/L, p&amp;lt;0.001). Proportion of time in range (3.9mmol/L to 10mmol/L) increased (n=47, 55.2% vs 58.0%, p=0.017), with no change to time below range (4.8% vs 5.0%, p=0.495). Conclusion: Glycaemic control improved in the 12 weeks following national lockdown. This demonstrates the difficulties faced by patients and carers managing T1DM around school pressures, meals away from home, social life and peer pressure. Increased remote contact with patients with T1DM has not been detrimental to glycaemic control.","Lawrence, Neil Richard Natarajan Anuja Petkar Razia Joseph Lovlin",Journal of the Endocrine Society,555,1

Their black-box nature has sparked many recent works to explain the prediction via input feature attribution methods (aka saliency methods). However, input feature attribution methods merely identify the importance of input regions for the prediction and lack semantic interpretation of model behavior. In this work, we first identify the semantics associated with internal units (feature maps) of the network. We proceed to investigate the following questions; Does a regression model that is only trained with COVID-19 severity scores implicitly learn visual patterns associated with thoracic pathologies? Does a network that is trained on weakly labeled data (e.g. healthy, unhealthy) implicitly learn pathologies? Moreover, we investigate the effect of pretraining and data imbalance on the interpretability of learned features. In addition to the analysis, we propose semantic attribution to semantically explain each prediction. We present our findings using publicly available chest pathologies (CheXpert, NIH ChestX-ray8) and COVID-19 datasets (BrixIA, and COVID-19 chest X-ray segmentation dataset).

This study aimed to explore the effect of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on high glucose (HG)-induced dysfunction and apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells. Materials and Methods: The viability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with different concentrations and times of EGCG was detected by CCK-8 assay. The expression levels of ROS, NO and BH4 in HUVECs after treatment were detected by respective ELISA kits. The expression of p-eNOS, eNOS, NOX4, bcl2, bax, cleaved-caspase3, caspase3, p-PI3K, p-AKT, PI3K and AKT in HUVECs was detected by Western blot analysis. The apoptosis of HUVECs after treatment was analyzed by TUNEL assay. Results: The viability of HUVECs was not obviously changed when treated with different concentrations and times of EGCG. The expression of ROS, NOX4 and eNOS (monomer) was increased, while the expression of NO, p-eNOS, eNOS, BH4 and eNOS (dimer) was decreased in HUVECs of HG group. EGCG could gradually reverse the effect of high glucose on HG-treated HUVECs from 10 µM to 50 µM. The apoptosis of HUVECs was also increased in HG group and EGCG decreased the apoptosis of HUVECs. PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was suppressed in HG-treated HUVECs while activated by EGCG treatment. When the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was inhibited by LY294002 (AKT inhibitor), the protective effect of EGCG on HG-treated HUVECs was weakened. Conclusion: EGCG could inhibit eNOS uncoupling and alleviate endothelial dysfunction and apoptosis of HG-treated HUVECs by activating the PI3K/AKT/eNOS pathway.","Zhang, Zhiyong; Zhang, Daimin",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,555,16

However, because they were excluded from pivotal studies and have weakened immune responses, it is not known whether these patients are protected after the ""standard"" two doses of mRNA vaccines. To answer this, anti-spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and interferon gamma-producing CD4+ and CD8+ specific-T cells were measured in the circulation 10-14 days after the second injection of BNT162b2 vaccine in 106 patients receiving MHD (14 with history of COVID-19) and compared to 30 healthy volunteers (four with history of COVID-19). After vaccination, most (72/80, 90%) patients receiving MHD naïve for the virus generated at least one type of immune effector, but their response was weaker and less complete than that of healthy volunteers. In multivariate analysis, hemodialysis and immunosuppressive therapy were significantly associated with absence of both anti-RBD IgGs and anti-spike CD8+ T cells. In contrast, previous history of COVID-19 in patients receiving MHD correlated with the generation of both types of immune effectors anti-RBD IgG and anti-spike CD8+ T cells at levels similar to healthy volunteers.

Why is there such a simple law in many complex social systems is an interesting question. Although scientists from fields of statistical physics, complex systems, economics and transportation science have explained the social gravity law, a theoretical explanation including two dominant mechanisms, namely individual interaction and bounded rationality, is still lacking. Here we present a free utility model from the perspective of individual choice behavior to explain the social gravity law. The basic assumption is that bounded rational individuals interacting with each other will trade off the expected utility and information-processing cost to maximize their own utility. The previous explanations of the social gravity law including the maximum entropy model, the free cost model, the Logit model and the destination choice game model are all special cases under our model. Further, we extend the free utility model to the dummy network and real transportation network. This model not only helps us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of spatial interaction patterns in complex social systems, but also provides a new perspective for understanding the potential function in game theory and the user equilibrium model in transportation science.","Wang, Hao; Yan, Xiao-Yong; Wu, Jinshan",,555,26

METHODS: The COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study is a longitudinal, nationally representative, online survey of UK adults. The current study analysed data from its first three waves of data collection: Wave 1 (March 2020, N = 2025), Wave 2 (April 2020, N = 1406) and Wave 3 (July 2020, N = 1166). Anxiety-depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (a composite measure of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7) and COVID-19-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the International Trauma Questionnaire. Changes in mental health outcomes were modelled across the three waves. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify subgroups of individuals with different trajectories of change in anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Latent class membership was regressed on baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of anxiety-depression remained stable, while COVID-19 PTSD reduced between Waves 2 and 3. Heterogeneity in mental health response was found, and hypothesised classes reflecting (i) stability, (ii) improvement and (iii) deterioration in mental health were identified. Psychological factors were most likely to differentiate the improving, deteriorating and high-stable classes from the low-stable mental health trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: A low-stable profile characterised by little-to-no psychological distress ('resilient' class) was the most common trajectory for both anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Monitoring these trajectories is necessary moving forward, in particular for the ~30% of individuals with increasing anxiety-depression levels.","Shevlin, Mark; Butter, Sarah; McBride, Orla; Murphy, Jamie; Gibson-Miller, Jilly; Hartman, Todd K; Levita, Liat; Mason, Liam; Martinez, Anton P; McKay, Ryan; Stocks, Thomas V A; Bennett, Kate; Hyland, Philip; Bentall, Richard P",Psychol Med,555,1

Typically, TMB is evaluated by comprehensive genomic profiling but this requires use of finite tissue specimens and costly, time-consuming laboratory processes. Histologic subtype classification represents an established component of lung adenocarcinoma histopathology, but can be challenging and is associated with substantial inter-pathologist variability. Here we developed a deep learning system to both classify histologic patterns in lung adenocarcinoma and predict TMB status using de-identified Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images. We first trained a convolutional neural network to map histologic features across whole slide images of lung cancer resection specimens. On evaluation using an external data source, this model achieved patch-level area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78-0.98 across nine histologic features. We then integrated the output of this model with clinico-demographic data to develop an interpretable model for TMB classification. The resulting end-to-end system was evaluated on 172 held out cases from TCGA, achieving an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI 0.63-0.80). The benefit of using histologic features in predicting TMB is highlighted by the significant improvement this approach offers over using the clinical features alone (AUC of 0.63 [95% CI 0.53-0.72], p = 0.002). Furthermore, we found that our histologic subtype-based approach achieved performance similar to that of a weakly supervised approach (AUC of 0.72 [95% CI 0.64-0.80]). Together these results underscore that incorporating histologic patterns in biomarker prediction for lung cancer provides informative signals, and that interpretable approaches utilizing these patterns perform comparably with less interpretable, weakly supervised approaches.","Sadhwani, Apaar; Chang, Huang-Wei; Behrooz, Ali; Brown, Trissia; Auvigne-Flament, Isabelle; Patel, Hardik; Findlater, Robert; Velez, Vanessa; Tan, Fraser; Tekiela, Kamilla; Wulczyn, Ellery; Yi, Eunhee S; Mermel, Craig H; Hanks, Debra; Chen, Po-Hsuan Cameron; Kulig, Kimary; Batenchuk, Cory; Steiner, David F; Cimermancic, Peter",Sci Rep,555,14

Several studies (GSE112790, GSE87630, and GSE56140) from the GEO database looking at molecular characteristics in HCC were screened and analyzed by GEO2R, which led to the identification of a total of 93 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). From the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, we selected 13 key genes with high degree of variability in expression in HCC. Expression of three key genes (NQO1, CYP2C9, and C6) presented with poor overall survival (OS) in HCC patients by UALCAN. C6, which is a complement component, was found by ONCOMINE and TIMER to have low expression in many solid cancers including HCC. Besides, Kaplan-Meier plotter and UALCAN database analysis to access diseases prognosis suggested that low expression of C6 is significantly related to worse OS in LIHC patients, especially in advanced HCC patients. Finally, the TIMER analysis suggested that the C6 expression showed significant negative correlation with infiltrating levels of six immune cells. The somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) of C6 were associated with CD4+ T cell infiltration in HCC.

In addition, patients with COVID-19 are known to develop micro-clots within the lungs. The rapid detection of COVID-19 uses genotypic testing for the presence of SARS-Cov-2 virus in nasopharyngeal swabs, but it can have a poor sensitivity. A rapid, host-based physiological test that indicated clotting severity and the extent of clotting pathologies in the individual who was infected or not would be highly desirable. METHODS: Platelet poor plasma (PPP) was collected and frozen. On the day of analysis, PPP samples were thawed and analysed. We show here that microclots can be detected in the native plasma of twenty COVID-19, as well as ten T2DM patients, without the addition of any clotting agent, and in particular that such clots are amyloid in nature as judged by a standard fluorogenic stain. Results were compared to ten healthy age-matched individuals. RESULTS: In COVID-19 plasma these microclots are significantly increased when compared to the levels in T2DM.

Several recently published studies emphasize the potential efficacy of mRNA vaccines in treating different types of malignant and infectious diseases where conventional vaccine strategies and platforms fail to elicit protective immune responses. mRNA vaccines have lately raised high interest as potent vaccines against SARS-CoV2. Direct application of mRNA or its electroporation into dendritic cells was shown to induce polyclonal CD4+ and CD8+ mediated antigen-specific T cell responses as well as the production of protective antibodies with the ability to eliminate transformed or infected cells. More importantly, the vaccine composition may include two or more mRNAs coding for different proteins or long peptides. This enables the induction of polyclonal immune responses against a broad variety of epitopes within the encoded antigens that are presented on various MHC complexes, thus avoiding the restriction to a certain HLA molecule or possible immune escape due to antigen-loss. The development and design of mRNA therapies was recently boosted by several critical innovations including the development of technologies for the production and delivery of high quality and stable mRNA. Several technical obstacles such as stability, delivery and immunogenicity were addressed in the past and gradually solved in the recent years.This review will summarize the most recent technological developments and application of mRNA vaccines in clinical trials and discusses the results, challenges and future directions with a special focus on the induced innate and adaptive immune responses.","Heine, Annkristin; Juranek, Stefan; Brossart, Peter",Mol Cancer,555,20

Inaccessible by conventional techniques, the mass of single nanoparticles and viruses (>10MDa) can be readily measured by NEMS (Nano-electromechanical Systems) based Mass Spectrometry, where charged and isolated analyte particles are generated by Electrospray Ionization (ESI) in air and transported onto the NEMS surface for capture and detection. However, the applicability of NEMS as a practical solution is hindered by their miniscule surface area, which results in poor limit-of-detection and low capture efficiency values. Another hindrance is the necessity to house the NEMS inside complex vacuum systems, which is required in part to focus analytes towards the miniscule detection surface of the NEMS. Here, we overcome both limitations by integrating an ionic lens onto the NEMS chip. The ionic lens is composed of a polymer layer, which charges up by receiving part of the ions incoming from the ESI tip and consequently starts to focus the analytes towards an open window aligned with the active area of the NEMS electrostatically. With this integrated system, we have detected the mass of gold and polystyrene nanoparticles under ambient conditions and with record capture efficiencies. We then applied this technology to obtain the mass spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 and BoHV-1 virions. With the increase in analytical throughput, the simplicity of the overall setup and the operation capability under ambient conditions, the technique brings NEMS mass spectrometry one step closer towards efficient mass detection of engineered nanoparticles and biological samples.","Erdogan, R.

Followed by the emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses in 2003 SARS-CoV, in 2012 MERS-CoV, now in 2019 pathogenic SARS-CoV-2, is associated with a global “pandemic” situation. In humans, the effects of these viruses are correlated with viral pneumonia, severe respiratory tract infections. It is believed that interaction between angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell receptor and viral Spike protein mediates the coronavirus entry into human respiratory epithelial cells and establishes the host tropism. ACE2 receptor is highly expressed in airway epithelial cells. Along with viral-receptor interaction, proteolytic cleavability of S protein has been considered as the determinant of disease severity. Several studies highlight the occurrence of impaired host immune response and expression of excessive inflammatory response especially cytokines against viral infection. The mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 induced acute lung injury are still undefined; however, the term cytokine storm has now been recognized to be closely associated with COVID-19. The levels of inflammatory mediators from cytokine storm cause damage to the host cells. In particular, the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 appears to be the key mediator in early phase of virus-receptor interaction; however, secreted IL-6 might not be representative of lung inflammation. Understanding the cellular, and molecular factors involved in immune dysregulation and the high virulence capacity of COVID-19 will help in potential targeted therapy against it. “Drug repurposing” and “molecular docking analysis” is considered as an attractive alternative approach in analyzing suitable drug candidates to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Globally, extensive research is in progress to discover a new vaccine for novel COVID-19. Moreover, our review mainly focuses on the most state-of-the-art therapeutic approach mediated by “Mannose-binding lectin (MBL).” One of the most significant molecules of innate immunity is MBL. It plays a major role in the activation of the complement system as an ante-antibody prior to the response of any particular antibody. Recombinant human MBL can be used as immunomodulators against SARS-CoV-2.","Chatterjee, Swapan K.; Saha, Snigdha; Munoz, Maria Nilda M.",Front. Mol. Biosci.,555,16

However, there is no specific antiviral therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We conducted a clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of three antiviral treatment regimens in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Methods: This was a single-center, randomized, open-labeled, prospective clinical trial. Eligible patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 were randomized into three groups: ribavirin (RBV) plus interferon-&#945; (IFN-&#945;), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) plus IFN-&#945;, and RBV plus LPV/r plus IFN-&#945; at a 1:1:1 ratio. Each patient was invited to participate in a 28-d follow-up after initiation of an antiviral regimen. The outcomes include the difference in median interval to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity, the proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity at day 14, the mortality at day 28, the proportion of patients re-classified as severe cases, and adverse events during the study period. Results: In total, we enrolled 101 patients in this study. Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients were comparable among the three groups. In the analysis of intention-to-treat data, the median interval from baseline to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity was 12 d in the LPV/r+IFN-&#945;-treated group, as compared with 13 and 15 d in the RBV+IFN-&#945;-treated group and in the RBV+LPV/r+ IFN-&#945;-treated group, respectively (p=0.23). The proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity in the LPV/r+IFN-&#945;-treated group (61.1%) was higher than the RBV+ IFN-&#945;-treated group (51.5%) and the RBV+LPV/r+IFN-&#945;-treated group (46.9%) at day 14; however, the difference between these groups was calculated to be statistically insignificant. The RBV+LPV/r+IFN-&#945;-treated group developed a significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events than the LPV/r+ IFN-&#945;-treated group and the RBV+ IFN-&#945;-treated group. Conclusions: Our results indicate that there are no significant differences among the three regimens in terms of antiviral effectiveness in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Furthermore, the combination of RBV and LPV/r is associated with a significant increase in gastrointestinal adverse events, suggesting that RBV and LPV/r should not be co-administered to COVID-19 patients simultaneously.

In this piece, we argue that these changes invite researchers to consider the short and longer-term consequences in terms of continuities and changes to the practices and symbolism of alcohol consumption both within and beyond domestic spaces. We do this by drawing on illustrations from our emergent qualitative research involving internet-mediated semi-structured interviews and focus groups with 20 participants from the UK (aged 26-65) concerning experiences of drinking in and beyond 'lockdown'. In sharing these early findings, we hope to highlight themes relevant to understanding drinking behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic and to stimulate dialogue for immediate research priorities in this area. Key topic areas in our data appear to concern; variability in heavy/moderate/light/non-drinking practices while drinking at home, lockdown as an opportunity to reassess relationships with alcohol, and the symbolic role of alcohol in internet-mediated communications and interactions. Longstanding policymaker and practitioner concerns with managing public drinking and public order may have been unsettled by a growth in home-based drinking, although, as we argue, such changes were in motion before the global pandemic. We propose that a greater understanding of the challenges and opportunities the pandemic presents for (re)negotiating relationships with alcohol may offer wider lessons around how individuals and communities might be supported via innovative policy measures to change their relationships with alcohol both during and beyond lockdown.","Nicholls, Emily; Conroy, Dominic",Int J Drug Policy,555,1

As a result, nations with heavy tourism, such as Belize, experienced improvements in water quality. Remote sensing technologies can detect impacts of “anthropauses” on coastal water quality. In this study, MODIS satellite data were employed along the Belizean coast to investigate impacts of the COVID-19 shutdown on water quality. The attenuation coefficient at 490 nm, Kd(490), was used as an indicator of water quality, with a lower Kd(490) indicating increased water clarity. Four Coastal Management Zones were characterized by marine traffic as high traffic areas (HTAs) and two as low traffic areas (LTAs). Monthly composites for two periods, 2002-2019 (baseline) and 2020 were examined for Kd(490). For months prior to the COVID-19 shutdown in Belize, there was generally no significant difference in Kd(490) (p&gt;0.05) between 2020 and baseline period in HTAs and LTAs. Through the shutdown, Kd was lower in 2020 at HTAs, but not for LTAs. At the LTAs, the Kd(490)s observed in 2020 were similar to previous years through October. In November, an unusually active hurricane season in 2020 was associated with decreased water clarity along the entire coast of Belize. This study provides proof of concept that satellite-based monitoring of water quality can complement in situ data and provide evidence of significant water quality improvements due to the COVID-19 shutdown, likely due to reduced marine traffic. However, these improvements were no longer observed following an active hurricane season.","Callejas, Ileana A.; Lee, Christine M.; Mishra, Deepak R.; Felgate, Stacey L.; Evans, Claire Carrias Abel Rosado Andria Griffin Robert Cherrington Emil A.; Ayad, Mariam Rudresh Megha Page Benjamin P.; Jay, Jennifer A.",Frontiers in Marine Science,555,5

Material and Methods: One hundred orthodontic patients (57 F, 43 M, age 7-46) during quarantine were checked through videocalls and photos sent by patients following proper instructions. Three groups have been distinguished based on the type of therapy: A-fixed appliances; B-removable appliances; C-clear aligners. Relevant events about dental and gingival health, integrity of appliances, orthodontic therapies related symptoms and overall progress of treatments were recorded. Results: A and B groups reported higher percentages of gingival inflammation (27 and 22%), dental plaque (16 and 13%), deciduous tooth loss (8 and 16%). Bracket and attachment detachment were the most frequent events in A and C groups (22 and 23%). Pain and discomfort were reported in A and B groups (35 and 32%). Therapies continued to progress better in C (51% improved dental alignment) and B (31% improved malocclusions) groups. Conclusion: Orthodontics is safe and allows during emergencies to postpone checks. Everyday mobile-technology is useful in managing orthodontic patients unable to carry out in-person control.

We aimed to investigate the clinical and imaging characteristics of COVID-19 patients with complete absorption of pulmonary lesions. Methods: Retrospectively collected the clinical and chest CT data of 224 patients with COVID-19 in one regional medical center. Currently, pulmonary lesions in 37 patients were completely absorbed. The clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, and CT findings of lesions for these patients were summarized. Results: Among the 37 patients (age, 39.0 ± 12.4 [14-63] years, 20 males), disease in 36 (97.3%) was mild and in 1 (2.7%) was from severe to mild. The most common symptoms were cough (24/37, 64.9%) and fever (23/37, 62.2%). Their laboratory indicators at admission were usually normal, while the white blood cell and neutrophil count significantly increased at discharge (p = 0.004, p = 0.006). On initial CT images, all patients had various pulmonary lesions (mean involved lobes: 2.8 ± 1.5, range: 1-5; mean involved segments: 6.6 ± 4.3, range: 1-16), which mainly manifested as multiple patchy and or spherical ground glass opacities (GGOs) (30/37, 81.1%) with fibrous strips (19/30, 63.3%) or consolidation (11/30, 36.7%). After treatment, lesions in most (33/37, 89.2%) patients were continuously absorbed. At discharge, previous lesions were mostly absorbed in 11 patients (11/37, 29.7%), the main residues were GGOs (24/37, 64.9%), followed by fibrous strips (13/37, 35.1%). On the latest CT, all the pulmonary lesions were completely absorbed, the duration of lesions was 31.6 ± 11.4 days (range: 5-50 days). Conclusion: The pulmonary lesions in some mild COVID-19 patients (generally with normal laboratory indicators at admission, GGOs as the main manifestation on initial CT, and representation of continuous absorption after treatment) could be completely absorbed with a mean duration of 31.6 days.","Liu, Xue-Yan; Lv, Fa-Jin; Lv, Sheng-Xiu; Fu, Bin-Jie; Md, Wang-Jia Li; Ouyang, Yu; Chu, Zhi-Gang",Int J Med Sci,555,16

As of June 21, 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused 8,769,844 confirmed infections with 463,745 fatal cases worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is a major challenge for clinicians. In our clinic, we found a rare case that a COVID-19 patient combined with ischemic stroke. CASE PRESENTATION: A 79-year-old man was admitted to the Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine due to right limb weakness for 1 day and slight cough for 1 week. At presentation, his oxygen saturation was 94.2% on room air and body temperature was 37.3 °C (99.0 °F) with some moist rales. Neurological examination showed right limb weakness, and the limb muscle strength was grade 4. The left leg and arms were unaffected. In addition, runs of speech were not fluent enough with tongue deviation. Laboratory studies showed lymphopenia and eosinophilic granulocytopenia. Chest CT revealed bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities, with a peripheral lung distribution. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from throat swab sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. This patient was treated with antiviral drugs and anti-inflammatory drugs with supportive care until his discharge. Clopidogrel (75 mg) and atorvastatin (20 mg) were administered orally to treat acute ischemic stroke. After 12 days of treatment, he can walk normally and communicate with near fluent language. CONCLUSION: We report an even more unusual case, a patient who was hospitalized for right limb weakness and was later diagnosed with COVID-19. Here, SARS-CoV-2 infection caused hypoxemia and excessive secretion of inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to the occurrence and development of ischemic stroke. Once COVID-19 patients show acute ischemic stroke, neurologists should cooperate with infectious disease doctors to help patients.","Zhai, Pan; Ding, Yanbing; Li, Yiming",Diagn Pathol,555,26

There are currently no specific antiviral treatments for COVID-19 and vaccination programmes, whilst promising, remain in their infancy. A key to restricting the pandemic is the ability to minimize human-human transmission and to predict the infection status of the population in the face of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Success in this area is dependent on the rapid detection of COVID-19 positive individuals with current/previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status. In this regard, the ability to detect antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-Spike protein in patient sera represents a powerful biomarker for confirmation of infection. Here, we report the design of a proof-of-concept cell-based fluorescent serology assay (termed C19-S-I-IFA) to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. The assay is based on the capture of IgG antibodies in the serum of COVID-19-positive patients using cells exogenously expressing SARS-CoV-2-Spike and their subsequent fluorescent detection. We validate the assay in 30 blood samples collected in Oxford, UK, in 2020 during the height of the pandemic. Importantly, the assay can be modified to express emerging Spike-variants to permit assessments of the cross-reactivity of patient sera to emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains.","Nguyen, Dung; Skelly, Donal; Goonawardane, Niluka",Viruses,555,22

Las respuestas inflamatorias secundarias por reinfecciones del virus podrían inducir el aumento o la mejora dependiente de anticuerpos (ADE, por sus siglas en inglés), un fenómeno virémico que podría ser un mecanismo alternativo de infección celular y que se deberá tener en cuenta cuando se diseñen vacunas o inmunoterapias que involucren el estímulo de anticuerpos neutralizantes o el uso de anticuerpos monoclonales. Actualmente no existen vacunas ni tratamientos que demuestren seguridad y eficacia en pacientes con COVID-19; sin embargo, se espera la conclusión de los resultados de la aplicación de una vacuna de ácidos nucleicos ARNm (mensajero del ácido ribonucleico) y de un fármaco antiviral (remdisivir) que se encuentran en ensayos clínicos fase III.

Transmission of the virus is difficult to control in these settings because of a combination of factors including environmental conditions and the specific nature of the work. This paper describes a retrospective outbreak investigation in a meat processing plant, a description of the measures taken to prevent or contain further outbreaks, and insights on how those with specific knowledge of the working environment of these plants can collaborate with public health authorities to ensure optimal outbreak control. The plant experienced 111 confirmed positive asymptomatic cases in total with an estimated attack rate of 38% during a five-week period. Four weeks after the first case, mass screening of all workers was conducted by the public health authorities. Thirty-two workers tested positive, of which 16 (50%) worked in one particular area of the plant, the boning hall (n=60). The research team prepared and carried out semi-structured interviews with the plant personnel who were charged with COVID control within the plant. They carried out assessments of operational risk factors and also undertook air quality monitoring in the boning hall and abattoir. The air quality measurements in the boning hall showed a gradual build-up of carbon dioxide and aerosol particles over the course of a work shift, confirming that this poorly ventilated area of the plant had an environment that was highly favourable for aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Assessment of operational conditions incorporated visual surveys of the plant during the working day. Prior to and during the first two weeks of the outbreak, multiple measures were introduced into the plant by management, including physical distancing, provision of educational material to workers, visitor restrictions, and environmental monitoring. After the implementation of these measures and their progressive refinement by plant management, the factory had no further linked cases (clusters) or outbreaks for the following 198 days. The tailored approach to risk mitigation adopted in this meat processing plant shows that generic risk mitigation measures, as recommended by public health authorities, can be successfully adapted and optimized by designated plant emergency response teams.","Walshe, Nicola; Fennelly, Meheal; Hellebust, Stig; Wenger, John; Sodeau, John; Prentice, Michael; Grice, Charlene; Jordan, Vincent; Comerford, John; Downey, Vicky; Perrotta, Carla; Mulcahy, Grace; Sammin, Donal",,555,1

However, due to an acute shortage of testing kits (especially in low-resource developing countries), designing an optimal testing program/strategy is a challenging problem to solve. Prior literature on testing strategies suffers from two major limitations: (i) it does not account for the trade-off between testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, and (ii) it primarily focuses on static testing strategies, which leads to significant shortcomings in the testing program’s effectiveness. In this paper, we address these limitations by making five novel contributions. (i) We formally define the optimal testing problem and propose the DOCTOR POMDP model to tackle it. (ii) We solve the DOCTOR POMDP using a scalable Monte Carlo tree search based algorithm. (iii) We provide a rigorous experimental analysis of DOCTOR’s testing strategies against static baselines - our results show that when applied to the city of Santiago in Panama, DOCTOR’s strategies result in ~40% fewer COVID-19 infections (over one month) as compared to state-of-the-art static baselines. (iv) In addition, we analyze DOCTOR’s testing policy to derive insights about the reasons behind the optimality of DOCTOR’s testing policy. (v) Finally, we characterize conditions (of the real world) under which DOCTOR’s optimization would be of most benefit to government policy makers, and thus requires significant attention from researchers in this area.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated its limitations. Mobile health clinic programs in the US already play important, albeit under-appreciated roles in the healthcare system. They provide access to healthcare especially for displaced or isolated individuals; they offer versatility in the setting of a damaged or inadequate healthcare infrastructure; and, as a longstanding community-based service delivery model, they fill gaps in the healthcare safety-net, reaching social-economically underserved populations in both urban and rural areas. Despite an increasing body of evidence of the unique value of this highly adaptable model of care, mobile clinics are not widely supported. This has resulted in a missed opportunity to deploy mobile clinics during national emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as using these already existing, and trusted programs to overcome barriers to access that are experienced by under-resourced communities. MAIN TEXT: In March, the Mobile Healthcare Association and Mobile Health Map, a program of Harvard Medical School's Family Van, hosted a webinar of over 300 mobile health providers, sharing their experiences, challenges and best practices of responding to COVID 19. They demonstrated the untapped potential of this sector of the healthcare system in responding to healthcare crises. A Call to Action: The flexibility and adaptability of mobile clinics make them ideal partners in responding to pandemics, such as COVID-19. In this commentary we propose three approaches to support further expansion and integration of mobile health clinics into the healthcare system: First, demonstrate the economic contribution of mobile clinics to the healthcare system. Second, expand the number of mobile clinic programs and integrate them into the healthcare infrastructure and emergency preparedness. Third, expand their use of technology to facilitate this integration. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the economic and social impact that mobile clinics are having in our communities should provide the evidence to justify policies that will enable expansion and optimal integration of mobile clinics into our healthcare delivery system, and help us address current and future health crises.","Attipoe-Dorcoo, Sharon; Delgado, Rigoberto; Gupta, Aditi; Bennet, Jennifer; Oriol, Nancy E; Jain, Sachin H",Int J Equity Health,555,11

METHODOLOGY: Two irrigation protocols - Protocol A using 2% NaOCl used 5mL/5 min and Protocol B with 2% NaOCl (5mL/5 min) followed by 17% EDTA (5mL/3 min) were used to prepare dentine. The chemical and microstructural changes following irrigation were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (n=5) on dentine obtained from the mid-root and coronal parts of extracted human teeth. Four sealers (AH Plus, BioRoot, MTA Fillapex, TotalFill) were characterized by SEM/EDS (n=3). The ability of the sealers to eradicate intratubular Enterococcus faecalis biofilms was assessed by live/dead dye and confocal laser scanning microscopy to measure the percentage of living cells. The effect of combined irrigation and root filling on the dentine was assessed by SEM and EDS analysis (n=5). Statistical analysis was undertaken using one-way ANOVA and a number of post hoc tests to detect intergroup differences. The F test was used for comparison of variances in the microbiology testing. RESULTS: The use of NaOCl alone left the smear layer seemingly intact, with traces of chlorine remaining on dentine. The use of BioRoot sealer restored the calcium ion levels of dentine which are depleted by the irrigation with EDTA. BioRoot exhibited antimicrobial properties against intratubular bacteria even in the presence of smear layer (Protocol A). The smear layer removal improved the bactericidal effect of all sealers and Ca2+ leaching. The use of a chelating agent was important for the intratubular sealer penetration for AH Plus but not the other sealers. CONCLUSION: The removal of smear layer was associated with greater penetration of AH Plus into the dentinal tubules but not for the penetration of HCSC sealers. BioRoot was a more effective sealer in reducing the bacterial load in the dentinal tubules than the other materials tested and the presence of smear layer did not affect its activity.","Zancan, R F; Di Maio, A; Tomson, P L; Duarte, Mah; Camilleri, J",Int. endod. j,555,16

AIMS: Given the significant influenza and coronavirus pandemics that have occurred in the 20thand 21stcentury, including the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 global pandemic, the objective of this analysis is to assess the occurrence of disease transmission to HCPs from the performance aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs). SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic meta-analysis looking at the odds ratio (OR) of AGP, causing infection among HCPs. We searched the following databases: MEDLINE (PubMed), ProQuest, Cochrane databases, and the Gray literature (ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform). In addition, we conducted nondatabase search activities. The search terms used were 'MERS-CoV,' 'COVID,' and 'SARS' combined with 'provider' or 'healthcare provider.' STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: RevMan meta-analysis was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Following the search, we reviewed 880 studies, of which six studies were eligible. The estimated odd ratio utilizing a control group of HCPs who were exposed to AGP but did not develop the infection was 1.85 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33, 2.57). The OR remained the same when we added another control group who, despite not being exposed to AGP, had developed the infection. The OR remained 1.85 (95% CI: 1.33, 2.55). However, there is an increase in the OR to 1.89 (95% CI: 1.38, 2.59) when we added HCPs who did not use adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) during the procedures to the total estimates. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of AGP with inadequate PPE can result in an increased risk of disease transmission to HCWs.","Bin Nafisah, S.; Mzahim, B.; Aleid, B.; Sheerah, S.; Almatrafi, D.; Ciottone, G.; Alanazi, K.; Khan, A.",Annals of Thoracic Medicine,555,33

Limited information is available about this stage of recovery or the lingering effects of the virus on pulmonary function and inflammation. This study aimed to describe lung function in patients recovering from COVID-19 hospitalization and to identify biomarkers in serum and induced sputum samples from these patients. METHODS: Patients admitted to Spanish hospitals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection by a real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were recruited for this study. Each hospital screened their lists of discharged patients at least 45 days after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were divided into mild/moderate and severe disease groups according to the severity of their symptoms during hospitalization. Patients' epidemiological and medical histories, comorbidities, chronic treatments, and laboratory parameters were evaluated. Pulmonary function tests, the standardized 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and chest computed tomography (CT) were also performed. The levels of proteases, their inhibitors, and shed receptors were measured in serum and induced sputum samples. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients with respiratory function tests were included in this study. The median number of days after the onset of symptoms was 104 (IQR 89.25, 126.75). COVID-19 was severe in 47% of patients (47/100). CT was normal in 48% of patients (48/100).

OBJECTIVES: We aim to determine the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on lipid profile and to evaluate whether the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) could be used to predict in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this retrospective chart review study, a total of 139 confirmed COVID-19 patients, whose diagnoses are confirmed by PCR and computerized tomography results, are enrolled. The study population is divided into two groups: the deceased patient group and the survivor group. For each patient, fasting total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and the triglyceride values are obtained from the laboratory tests required at the admission to hospital. Finally, the AIP is calculated as the base 10 logarithm of the triglyceride to HDL-C ratio. Distributional normality of the data is checked and depending on the normality of the data, either T test or Mann Whithey U test is employed to compare the two aforementioned study groups. RESULTS: Mean age of the study population is 49.2 ± 20.8 and 61.2% (n = 85) is male. Out of the 139 patients 26 have deceased and the remaining 113 patients survived the disease. Mean age of the deceased patients was 71.8*8.9 and mean age of the survivor patients is 44.0*19.2 (p < 0.001). The deceased group had more patients with hypertension (50.0% vs. 23.0, p = 0.006), diabetes mellitus (35.6% vs. 10.6%, p = 0.002), cardiovascular diseases (23.1% vs. 4.4%, p = 0.001), chronic renal insufficiency (11.5% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.003) and atrial fibrillation (7.7% vs 0%, p = 0.003). The AIP values in the deceased group are found to be statistically higher (p < 0.001) than the survivor group. As a measure of mortality, the area under the operating characteristic curve for the AIP is calculated as 0.850 (95% confidence interval: 0.772-0.928) along with the optimal cut-off value of 0.6285 (78.6% sensitivity and 80.5% specificity). Furthermore, the AIP value is observed to be elevated in patients with pneumonia, intubation history, and intensive care admission during hospital stay (p = 0.002, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Finally, compared to the survivor group, total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C values are lower (p = 0.004, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) and triglyceride levels are higher (p < 0.001) in deceased patients. CONCLUSION: In this study, we show that the AIP levels higher than 0.6285 can predict in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the AIP emerges as a good candidate to be used as an early biomarker to predict pneumonia, intubation and intensive care need. Hence, regular check of the AIP levels in COVID-19 patients can improve management of these patients and prevent deterioration of the disease.","Turgay Yildirim, Özge; Kaya, Seyhmus",Heart Lung,555,29

Especially, when it is difficult for lecturers and learners to get close to each other in the context of Covid-19 epidemic period, online learning shows its availability and necessary. Learning materials provided in the educational institutions are diverse;almost lectures are stored as files but have not been totally arranged in a standard database system. Therefore, searching information about curriculum and lectures still face difficulties. This paper proposes a solution for semantic-based searching in learning resources. Firstly, ontologies are built to represent information of lectures. When users enter a query, the system pre-processes it (e.g., word segmentation, removing stop words), and then provides it to classifier (e.g., SVM) to identify the corresponding domain (or topic), aiming to narrow the search space in the ontology. After classifying, the key phrases will be queried in the appropriate ontology to result in related lectures.

MethodsMaternal and cord blood sera were collected following term delivery after antenatal SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination, with the first vaccine dose administered during 27-36 weeks gestation. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) and receptor binding domain (RBD)- specific, IgG levels and neutralizing potency were evaluated in maternal and cord blood samples. ResultsThe study cohort consisted of 171 parturients (median age, 31 years; median gestational age, 39.7 weeks): 83 (48.5%) immunized at early 3rd trimester (1st dose at 27-31 weeks), and 88 (51.5%) immunized at late 3rd trimester (1st dose at 32-36 weeks). All mother-infant paired sera were positive for anti S- and anti-RBD-specific IgG. Anti-RBD-specific IgG concentrations in neonatal sera were higher following early versus late 3rd trimester vaccination and were positively correlated with increasing time since vaccination (r={square}0.26; P=0.001). The median placental transfer ratios of anti-S and anti-RBD specific IgG were increased following early versus late 3rd trimester immunization (anti-S ratio:1.3 vs. 0.9, anti-RBD-specific ratio:2.3 vs. 0.7, P<0.001). Neutralizing antibodies placental transfer ratio was greater following early versus late 3rd trimester immunization (1.9 vs. 0.8, P<0.001), and was positively associated with longer duration from vaccination (r={square}0.77; P<0.001). ConclusionsEarly- as compared to late third trimester maternal SARS-CoV-2 immunization enhanced transplacental antibody transfer and increased neonatal neutralizing antibody levels. Our findings highlight that vaccination of pregnant women early in the third trimester may optimize neonatal seroprotection.","Rottenstreich, Amihai; Zarbiv, Gila; Oiknine-Djian, Esther; Vorontsov, Olesya; Zigron, Roy; Kleinstern, Geffen; Wolf, Dana; Porat, Shay",,555,21

This is the first study in the scientific literature reporting the psychological impact of the Covid-19 outbreak in a sample of the Spanish population. A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey of 3480 people. The presence of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated with screening tests from 14 March. Sociodemographic and Covid-19-related data was collected. Additionally, spiritual well-being, loneliness, social support, discrimination and sense of belonging were assessed. Descriptive analyses were carried out and linear regression models compiled. The 18.7% of the sample revealed depressive, 21.6% anxiety and 15.8% PTSD symptoms. Being in the older age group, having economic stability and the belief that adequate information had been provided about the pandemic were negatively related to depression, anxiety and PTSD. However, female gender, previous diagnoses of mental health problems or neurological disorders, having symptoms associated with the virus, or those with a close relative infected were associated with greater symptomatology in all three variables. Predictive models revealed that the greatest protector for symptomatology was spiritual well-being, while loneliness was the strongest predictor of depression, anxiety and PTSD. The impact on our mental health caused by the pandemic and the measures adopted during the first weeks to deal with it are evident. In addition, it is possible to identify the need of greater psychological support in general and in certain particularly vulnerable groups.","González-Sanguino, Clara; Ausín, Berta; Castellanos, Miguel Ángel; Saiz, Jesús; López-Gómez, Aída; Ugidos, Carolina; Muñoz, Manuel",Brain Behav Immun,555,20

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the psychological factors that drive adoption or rejection of these protective behaviors, which can inform public health interventions to control the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of a representative sample of 1074 US adults and assessed three novel potential predictors of COVID-19 behaviors: trait reactance, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, and COVID-19 apocalypse beliefs. Key outcomes (dependent variables) included an index of COVID-19 protective behaviors, the number of trips taken from the home, and COVID-19 knowledge. RESULTS: In bivariate analyses, all three predictors were significantly correlated in the hypothesized direction with the three COVID-19 outcomes. Specifically, each predictor was negatively (P<.01) correlated with the COVID-19 protective behaviors index and COVID-19 knowledge score, and positively correlated with trips taken from home per week (more of which was considered higher risk). COVID-19 protective behaviors and COVID-19 knowledge were significantly lower in the top median compared to the bottom median for all three predictors. In general, these findings remained significant after adjusting for all novel predictors plus age, gender, income, education, race, political party, and religiosity. Self-identified Republicans (vs other political affiliations) reported the highest values for each of the novel predictors. CONCLUSIONS: This study can inform the development of health communication interventions to encourage the adoption of COVID-19 protective behaviors. Interestingly, we found that higher scores of all three novel predictors were associated with lower COVID-19 knowledge, suggesting that lack of an accurate understanding of the virus may be driving some of these attitudes; although, it is also possible that these attributes may interfere with one's willingness or ability to seek and absorb accurate health information. These individuals may be particularly immune to accepting new information and yielding their beliefs. Health communication professionals may apply lessons learned from countering similar beliefs around climate change and vaccine hesitancy. Messages designed for individuals prone to reactance may be more effective if they minimize controlling language and emphasize the individual's independence in adopting these behavioral recommendations. Messaging for those who possess conspiracy beliefs should similarly not assume that providing evidence contrary to these beliefs will alone alter behavior. Other communication techniques such as rolling with resistance, a strategy used in motivational interviewing, may be helpful. Messaging for those with apocalyptic beliefs may require using religious leaders as the message source and using scripture that would support the adoption of COVID-19 protection behaviors.","Resnicow, Ken; Bacon, Elizabeth; Yang, Penny; Hawley, Sarah; Van Horn, M Lee; An, Lawrence",J Med Internet Res,555,29

NPIs promote protective actions to reduce exposure risk and can reduce mobility patterns within communities. Growing research literature suggests that socially vulnerable populations are disproportionately impacted with higher infection and higher fatality rates of COVID-19, though there is limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms to this health disparity. Thus, the research examines two distinct and complimentary datasets at a granular scale for five urban locations. Through statistical and spatial analyses, the research extensively investigates the exposure risk reduction of socially vulnerable populations due to NPIs. The mobility dataset tracks population movement across ZIP codes; it is used for an origin-destination network analysis. The population activity dataset is based on the number of visits from census block groups (CBG) to points of interest (POIs), such as grocery stores, restaurants, education centers, and medical facilities; it is used for network analysis of population-facilities interactions. The mobility dataset showed that, after the implementation of NPIs, socially vulnerable populations engaged in increased mobility in the form of inflow between ZIP code areas. Similarly, population activity analysis showed an increased exposure risk for socially vulnerable populations based on a greater number of inflow visits of CBGs to POIs, which increases the risk of contact at POIs, and a greater number of outflow visits from POIs to home CBGs, which increases risk of transmission within CBGs. These findings can assist emergency planners and public health officials in comprehending how different groups are able to implement protective actions and can inform more equitable and data-driven NPI policies for future epidemics.","Coleman, Natalie; Gao, Xinyu; DeLeon, Jared; Mostafavi, Ali",,555,13

We postulate that poor prognosis in patients with SARS-CoV2 may be associated with uncontrollable viral replication, co-infection with a secondary pathogen, and over exuberant host immune response. We seek to evaluate whether there is an association between distinct features of the lower airway microbiota and poor clinical outcome in patients with SARS-CoV2. METHODS:We collected lower airway samples in 148 patients from NYU admitted between 3/10/2020 and 5/10/2020 with severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and that underwent bronchoscopy for airway clearance and/or tracheostomy. Clinical outcome was defined as dead vs alive. DNA was isolated in parallel using zymoBIOMICS™ DNA/RNA Miniprep Kit (Cat: R2002) as per manufacturer's instructions. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene marker was sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. Sequences were analyzed using the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME version 1.9.1) pipeline. Total bacterial load was evaluated in lower airway samples using digital droplet PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene. RESULTS:Of the 148 patients included, 114 survived (77%) and 34 (23%) died. Among those with poor clinical outcome, there was a non-statistically significant trend towards higher age and BMI. Patients who died more commonly had chronic kidney disease and prior cerebrovascular accidents, and more often required dialysis. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of positive bacterial respiratory or blood cultures among those that survived vs. those that died (75 vs. 73% and 43 vs 38%, respectively). Topographical analysis of the 16S RNA microbiome shows compositional differences between the upper and lower airways based on β diversity comparisons. When comparing across clinical outcomes, the α diversity was lower in the dead group but there was no statistically significant difference in overall community composition (β diversity). Taxonomic differential enrichment analysis using DESeq analysis showed that oral commensals were enriched in the group that survived. Patients that died had a higher bacterial load in their lower airways than those who survived. CONCLUSION:Using samples obtained via bronchoscopy we identified lower airway microbiota signatures associated with mortality among critical patients infected with SARS-CoV2. Taxonomic signals identified as associated with poor prognosis did not reveal bacterial taxa commonly classified as respiratory pathogens. This data is not supportive of the hypothesis that secondary untreated bacterial co-infections are responsible for increased mortality in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2.","Barnett, C.

Although discussions have centered on policies to promote financial liquidity, we examine whether the state apparatus-not only state-owned enterprises but also development agencies and investment funds-can innovate and adjust production processes to improve infrastructure and capabilities to prevent and treat the disease. Potential actions include public-private effort addressing both discovery and coordination problems-such as a collaborative effort to develop prevention and treatment technologies, as well as state capital to stimulate retooling and expansion of strategic infrastructure. The state apparatus can also help access remote and critical areas with relatively lower private returns. In contrast, support to industries must be implemented with caution, especially for sectors whose demand may suffer permanently due to lifestyle changes. Exit strategies must be carefully crafted to avoid the risk of perpetuating unjustified and ineffective state support, establishing milestones and termination clauses based on clear performance indicators. We argue that, although using the state apparatus as a countermeasure entails a set of risks, not using it may increase the risk of extending the crisis and end with an overloaded state sector (e.g., due to massive bailouts), challenging the implementation of subsequent adjustments.","Lazzarini, Sérgio Giovanetti; Musacchio, Aldo",Rev. adm. pública (Online),555,32

There are numerous receptors, antigens, and biomarkers that have been discovered as oncological targets (oncotargets) for cancer diagnosis and treatment applications. Oncotargets are critically important to navigate active anticancer drug ingredients to specific disease sites with no/minimal effect on surrounding normal cells. In silico techniques relating to genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics have catalyzed the discovery of oncotargets for various cancer types. Effective oncotargeting requires high-affinity probes engineered for specific binding of receptors associated with the malignancy. Computational methods such as structural modeling and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations offer opportunities to structurally design novel ligands and optimize binding affinity for specific oncotargets. This article proposes a streamlined approach for the development of ligand-oncotarget bioaffinity systems via integrated structural modeling and MD simulations, making use of proteomics, genomic, and X-ray crystallographic resources, to support targeted diagnosis and treatment of cancers and tumors.","Jeevanandam, Jaison; Sabbih, Godfred; Tan, Kei X; Danquah, Michael K",Mol. biotechnol,555,30

OBJECTIVE: To compare COVID-19 trends among people with and without IDD, overall and stratified by age. METHODS: Data from the TriNetX COVID-19 Research Network platform was used to identify COVID-19 patients. Analysis focused on trends in comorbidities, number of cases, number of deaths, and case-fatality rate among patients with and without IDD who had a positive diagnosis for COVID-19 through May 14, 2020. RESULTS: People with IDD had higher prevalence of specific comorbidities associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes. Distinct age-related differences in COVID-19 trends were present among those with IDD, with a higher concentration of COVID-19 cases at younger ages. In addition, while the overall case-fatality rate was similar for those with IDD (5.1%) and without IDD (5.4%), these rates differed by age: ages &#8804;17 - IDD 1.6%, without IDD <0.01%; ages 18-74 - IDD 4.5%, without IDD 2.7%; ages &#8805;75- IDD 21.1%, without IDD, 20.7%.

So, the goal of the present study is to learn from the pathophysiology of COVID-19 clinical features, laboratory results, and high-resolution CT manifestations in different stages of disease severity to provide significant reference values for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. METHODS: This was a multicentered study that included 128 patients. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, in addition to chest HRCT findings, were evaluated. According to chest HRCT features, radiologic scoring were grade 1 and 2 for mild grades of the disease, 3 and 4 for moderate grades of the disease, and 5 and 6 for severe grades of the disease. RESULTS: Patient clinical symptoms ranged between fever, dry cough, muscle ache (myalgia)/fatigue, dyspnea, hyposomia, sore throat, and diarrhea. Lymphocytes and WBCs were significantly lower in patients with severe COVID-19. A significant negative correlation was found with WBCs (r = - 0.245, P = 0.005), lymphocytes% (r = - 0.586, P < 0.001), RBCs (r = - 0.2488, P = 0.005), Hb (gm/dl) (r = - 0.342, P < 0.001), and HCT (r = - 0.377, P < 0.001).

One of the most notable properties of R. glutinis is the formation of intracellular lipid droplets full of carotenoids. However, the basic genomic features that underlie the biosynthesis of these valuable compounds in R. glutinis have not been fully documented. To reveal the biotechnological potential of R. glutinis, the genomics and lipidomics analysis was performed through the Next-Generation Sequencing and HPLC-MS-based metabolomics technologies. RESULTS: Here, we firstly assemble the genome of R. glutinis ZHK into 21.8 Mb, containing 30 scaffolds and 6774 predicted genes with a N50 length of 14, 66,672 bp and GC content of 67.8%. Genome completeness assessment (BUSCO alignment: 95.3%) indicated the genome assembly with a high-quality features. According to the functional annotation of the genome, we predicted several key genes involved in lipids and carotenoids metabolism as well as certain industrial enzymes biosynthesis. Comparative genomics results suggested that most of orthologous genes have underwent the strong purifying selection within the five Rhodotorula species, especially genes responsible for carotenoids biosynthesis. Furthermore, a total of 982 lipids were identified using the lipidomics approaches, mainly including triacylglycerols, diacylglyceryltrimethylhomo-ser and phosphatidylethanolamine. CONCLUSION: Using whole genome shotgun sequencing, we comprehensively analyzed the genome of R. glutinis and predicted several key genes involved in lipids and carotenoids metabolism. By performing comparative genomic analysis, we show that most of the ortholog genes have undergone strong purifying selection within the five Rhodotorula species. Furthermore, we identified 982 lipid species using lipidomic approaches. These results provided valuable resources to further advance biotechnological applications of R .glutinis.","Li, Chun-Ji; Zhao, Die; Cheng, Ping; Zheng, Li; Yu, Guo-Hui",BMC Genomics,555,20

Twenty-one COVID-19 therapeutic studies (n = 15, prospective; n = 6, retrospective) that recruited from the United States and Europe were identified. Among these studies, eight (38%) reported on the number of trial participants with a cancer diagnosis in the publication and two (10%) specified tumor type. Four of the studies (19%) did not collect cancer history. Among studies where cancer history was available, patients with a cancer diagnosis participated at a proportion higher than overall cancer prevalence and greater than the known proportion of COVID-19 patients with cancer. CONCLUSION: This study observed that cancer history was not uniformly collected or reported among published COVID-19 therapeutic studies. Among reported publications, we observed that patients with a cancer diagnosis were generally overrepresented. However, patients with a cancer diagnosis were notably underrepresented in outpatient COVID-19 therapeutic studies.","Rabow, Maya; Wang, Christine; Zhang, Sylvia; Tahir, Peggy Mary; Small, Eric J; Borno, Hala T",Cancer Rep (Hoboken),555,26

Biologics used to modulate hC5a are predominantly monoclonal antibodies. Here we present data to support an alternative therapeutic approach based on the specific inactivation of hC5a by ScpA in studies using recombinant hC5a (rhC5a). Initial characterization of ScpA confirmed activity in human serum and against rhC5a desArg (rhC5adR), the predominant hC5a form in blood. A new FRET based enzyme assay showed that ScpA cleaved rhC5a at near physiological concentrations (K m 185 nM). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) studies established a high affinity ScpA-rhC5a interaction (K D 34 nM, K D ITC 30.8 nM). SPR analyses also showed that substrate binding is dominated (89% of &#916;G°bind) by interactions with the bulky N-ter cleavage product (PN, 'core' residues 1-67) with interactions involving the C-ter R74 contributing most of the remaining &#916;G°bind. Furthermore, reduced binding affinity following mutation of a subset of positively charged Arginine residues of PN and in the presence of higher salt concentrations, highlighted the importance of electrostatic interactions. These data provide the first in-depth study of the ScpA-C5a interaction and indicate that ScpA's ability to efficiently cleave physiological concentrations of C5a is driven by electrostatic interactions between an exosite on the enzyme and the 'core' of C5a. The results and methods described herein will facilitate engineering of ScpA to enhance its potential as a therapeutic for excessive immune response to infectious disease.","Tecza, Malgorzata; Kagawa, Todd F; Jain, Monica; Cooney, Jakki C",,555,1

It is important to consider the effect that this change in method of delivery has had on experience.MethodAn anonymous survey was distributed to determine the benefits and challenges from participants and facilitators with at least a month of virtual Balint Group experience. The open-ended survey questions captured extended answer responses from 16 students and trainees, and 5 (co-)facilitators, within Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. The qualitative feedback was analysed by thematic analysis, identifying three main themes.ResultThe first theme of practicalities was centred around access to the group. The virtual format had benefits in terms of reducing travel and time commitment and so improving attendance. However, disadvantages were in technological issues and finding a private and safe environment, individuals often not leaving the work environment on which they were reflecting.The second theme of communication identified how virtual methods are a less natural way of interacting (for example sequential point making), losing both immediacy of reactions and non-verbal communication. There was a loss of essential communication cues, with disjointed conversation affecting contribution.The third theme of group dynamics had some advantages, feeling less intimidating virtually. Yet disadvantages included loss of group cohesion, with participants not building the same relationships (on arriving and leaving a group space), and trust. The more subtle emotions in the group might be missed and opinions given less openly. The facilitators needed to be more directive and experienced difficulties maintaining group engagement and managing the frame.ConclusionThe advantages of virtual format are more based on accessibility and the disadvantages more experiential. There are elements of being physically remote that lead to a disembodied experience, that might impact on capacity to reflect emotionally. This might make it more difficult to identify unconscious processes and the experience might be more cognitive. There is a risk that virtually participants will feel more alone with difficult feelings and unsupported by the group.When mental health is being affected by social isolation due to the pandemic, having groups virtually can mimic this isolation in working life. Overall the preference remained for an in-person group.However, it was clear that access to some form of a group was important, to contain anxiety during these unprecedented times.","Brown, Rebecca Philips Nicola",BJPsych Open,555,20

Yet, opportunities to perform both functions concurrently for the same population are scarce. Residents must also master the art of preventive medicine, but they often lack an established community of practice that provides a continuous forum to do so. This project explored Population Health Rounds as a novel vehicle to optimize preventive medicine residency training. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Modeled after traditional medical rounds, Population Health Rounds consist of a 1-hour weekly meeting engaging preventive medicine residents and supervising attendings at Stony Brook Medicine in both population medicine and clinical preventive medicine concurrently, including patient case discussions and targeted population health analytics. EVALUATION AND RESULTS: Because of the pandemic, the rounds have predominantly focused on COVID-19 and its effects on the hospital employee population. In addition to providing direct patient care to COVID-19-positive and exposed employees, residents have analyzed data on this population and made recommendations to hospital leadership based on COVID-19's institutional epidemiology, including incidence, prevalence, and predictive factors. A formative qualitative survey of resident perceptions offers insights on the value and learning outcomes of this new model. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Factors that may impact the implementation, sustainability, and feasibility of this model are discussed. The preventive medicine residency program is commissioned to address gaps in clinical preventive services for the patient-centered medical home tied to the sponsoring institution's family medicine practice. Additional plans are underway to expand the rounds to other clinical contexts, such as lifestyle medicine in the occupational setting, and for targeted populations, such as the underserved.

Past studies in reinforcement learning and educational psychology have linked prediction error, a measure of surprise, to successful learning from feedback. However, there are substantial individual differences in belief-updating success, and the psychological factors that influence belief updating remain unclear. Here, we identify a novel factor that may predict belief updating: right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), which is characterized by a desire for order, structure, and preservation of social norms. We hypothesized that because people who score high on RWA are motivated to preserve entrenched beliefs, they may often fail to successfully update their beliefs when confronted with new information. Using a novel paradigm, we challenged participants' false beliefs and misconceptions to elicit prediction error. In two studies, we found consistent evidence that high-RWA individuals were less successful at correcting their false beliefs.

Through a prospective CSRV survey program conducted from 2016 onwards in allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) recipients with respiratory symptoms, we aimed to analyze and compare the epidemiology and characteristics of CSRV over three consecutive periods [from February 1 to September 30 of 2018 (P1), 2019 (P2), and 2020 (P3)]. CSRV screening was performed through multiplex PCR assays during the study period. We identified 188 consecutive allo-HSCT recipients with 406 episodes screened for CSRV during the study period, of which 147 developed 300 CSRV. In P1 and P2 we diagnosed 115 (38.3%) and 145 (48.3%) CSRV episodes, respectively, whereas in P3 only 40 (13.3%) episodes were detected (p < 0.001). During P3, we observed a reduction of 80.2% in Ev/Rh, 93.3% in RSV, 80% in hIV, 96.3% HPIV, 68.4% in hMPV, 77.7% in ADV, 100% in HBoV, and 53.6% in HCoV as compared to P1 and P2. Consequently, we also observed a decline in absolute numbers of lower respiratory tract disease (68.1%), co-infections (91.7%), and hospitalizations (72.6%) during P3. We diagnosed SARS-COV-2 in nine allo-HSCT recipients, representing 23% of all CSRV detections in that period. In conclusion, we provide evidence of a significant drop in CSRV circulation during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic in our allo-HSCT recipients, indicating that prevention measures in the general population are highly effective in reducing CSRV prevalence and its complications in immunocompromised patients.","De la Puerta, Rosalía; Montoro, Juan; Aznar, Carla; Lorenzo, Ignacio; González-Barberá, Eva María; Balaguer-Roselló, Aitana; Guerreiro, Manuel; Domínguez, Lara; Salavert, Miguel; Aguilar, Cristóbal; de la Rubia, Javier; Sanz, Jaime; Gómez, María Dolores; Piñana, José Luis",Bone marrow transplant,555,20

Acknowledging the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to mutate into distinct strains as an RNA virus and investigating its potential to cause reinfection is important for future health policy guidelines. It was thought that individuals who recovered from COVID-19 generate a robust immune response and develop protective immunity; however, since the first case of documented reinfection of COVID-19 in August 2020, there have been a number of cases with reinfection. Many cases are lacking genomic data of the two infections, and it remains unclear whether they were caused by different strains. In the present study, we undertook a rapid systematic review to identify cases infected with different genetic strains of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by PCR and viral genome sequencing. A total of 17 cases of genetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection were found. One immunocompromised patient had mild symptoms with the first infection but developed severe symptoms resulting in death with the second infection. Overall, 68.8% (11/16) had similar severity; 18.8% (3/16) had worse symptoms; and 12.5% (2/16) had milder symptoms with the second episode. Our case series shows that reinfection with different strains is possible, and some cases may experience more severe infections with the second episode. The findings also suggest that COVID-19 may continue to circulate even after achieving herd immunity through natural infection or vaccination, suggesting the need for longer-term transmission mitigation efforts.","Wang, Jingzhou; Kaperak, Christopher; Sato, Toshiro; Sakuraba, Atsushi",J Investig Med,555,1

While it is essential to quantify risk and characterize transmission dynamics in closed populations using Susceptible-Infection-Recovered modeling, the investigation of the effect from worldwide pandemic cannot be neglected. This study proposes a network analysis to assess global pandemic risk by linking 164 countries in pandemic networks, where links between countries were specified by the level of 'co-movement' of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases. More countries showing increase in the COVID-19 cases simultaneously will signal the pandemic prevalent over the world. The network density, clustering coefficients, and assortativity in the pandemic networks provide early warning signals of the pandemic in late February 2020. We propose a preparedness pandemic risk score for prediction and a severity risk score for pandemic control. The preparedness risk score contributed by countries in Asia is between 25% and 50% most of the time after February and America contributes around 40% in July 2020. The high preparedness risk contribution implies the importance of travel restrictions between those countries. The severity risk score of America and Europe contribute around 90% in December 2020, signifying that the control of COVID-19 is still worrying in America and Europe. We can keep track of the pandemic situation in each country using an online dashboard to update the pandemic risk scores and contributions.","So, Mike K P; Chu, Amanda M Y; Tiwari, Agnes; Chan, Jacky N L",Sci Rep,555,20

As 7-month-old infants explored initial stimuli that were composed of either a single nonmoving component or multiple moving components, one of several types of distractors was presented in the periphery. Infants' distraction latencies (the amount of time they took to turn from the initial stimulus to the distractor) varied as a function of the interaction between the infants' attentional state at distractor onset and the characteristics of the stimuli. Variations in the visual characteristics of the distractor stimulus (solid rectangle vs. checkerboard) had a larger effect on distraction latency when infants were in a focused attentional state than when they were in a casual attentional state. Similarly, variations in the auditory characteristic of the distractor stimulus (1 intermittent tone vs. 2 alternating tones) had a larger effect when infants were engaged in a focused attentional state toward the multicomponent toys. Thus, infants' distractibility in this context reflects an interaction between the infants' attentional state and the competition between external stimuli for their attentional focus.","Oakes, Lisa M; Tellinghuisen, Donald J; Tjebkes, Terri L",Infancy,555,15

It is important to develop faculty knowledge and confidence to integrate education for sustainable healthcare into their educational practice, as faculty can rapidly acquire and build on these skills. Partnership between students and faculty can enhance this faculty development as students bring fresh ideas and possibly greater knowledge of the climate and ecological crisis. Under supervision, they can co-create the necessary new learning.

Although many articles have established the clinical characteristics of adult COVID-19 patients so far, limited data are available for children. The aim of this study was to reveal the clinical features, laboratory findings and nucleic acid test results of ten pediatric cases. METHODS: In this retrospective single-center cohort study, pediatric cases with COVID-19 infection were consecutively enrolled in one hospital in Huangshi, China from January 1 to March 11, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 10 children with COVID-19 were recruited. Of them, four were the asymptomatic type, one was the mild type, and five were the moderate type (including two subclinical ones). All patients were from family clusters. Only fever, nasal discharge and nasal congestion were observed. Lymphopenia and leukopenia were uncommon in our sample but elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (alpha-HBDH) were observed frequently. Of these laboratory test variables, no statistical difference was identified between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Abnormalities in radiological data were detected in five patients, and representative findings of chest CT images were patchy shadows and ground-glass opacities. There were two cases whose oropharyngeal nucleic acid tests reversed to positive after one negative result, and two patients whose oropharyngeal swabs tested negative but rectal swabs showed positive. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical symptoms were mild in children with COVID-19. Increased levels of LDH and alpha-HBDH were potential clinical biomarkers for pediatric cases. More attention should be paid to the SARS-CoV-2 viral assessment of rectal swabs before patients are discharged.","Jiang, H.; Cheng, H.; Cao, Q.; Fei, A.; Yuan, M.; Zhang, L.; Fei, S.; Li, J.; Yang, S.; Wu, J.; Fu, Q.; Li, S.; Zhang, X.",Biomedical Journal,555,20

This risk factor for COVID-19 cannot only be explained by comorbidities and advanced age of patients, but aggravated by secondary immunodeficiency (SID). We aimed at evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on 86 HM patients with concomitant SID from a single centre. Only 14 HM patients of 86 (16.28%) patients suffered COVID-19, with mortality rate of 7%. When we considered patients according to B-cell defect only or multiple immune defect overlap (B-T-cell/NK cells/complement), patients with immune defect overlap presented 5.30-fold higher risk of COVID-19 than only B cell defect (95% CI, 1.67?17.0) (p = 0.004). Seven (50%) patients were on active IgRT;while five (36%) had received prior mucosal vaccines for respiratory infections.

Residents most commonly reported comfort with skills related to pain and symptom management (n = 67, 94.3%; score > 3 on 5-point Likert scale), and least commonly reported comfort with donation after cardiac death skills (n = 26-38; 44.8%-65.5%). Base specialty and time in CCM training were independently associated with comfort ratings for some, but not all, EOL skills. With respect to family meetings, residents infrequently received feedback; however, most PDs believed feedback on 6 to 10 meetings is required for competence. When PD perceptions of teaching effectiveness were compared with resident comfort ratings, differences were most apparent for skills related to pain and symptom management, cultural awareness, and ethical principles. By the end of their first subspecialty training year, PDs expect residents to be competent at most, but not all, EOL skills. In summary, trainees and programs rely on clinical activities to develop competency in EOL care, resulting in some educational gaps. Transitioning to competency-based medical education presents an opportunity to address some of these gaps, while other gaps will require more specific curricular intervention.","Arora, Samantha; Shaikh, Sameer; Karachi, Tim; Vanniyasingam, Thuva; Centofanti, John; Piquette, Dominique; Meade, Maureen; Boyle, Anne; Woods, Anne; Downar, James; Cook, Deborah",J Intensive Care Med,555,6

The aims of the current study were to (1) document the breadth of COVID-19 experiences and their impacts on college students of a minority-serving academic institution in NYC; (2) explore associations between patterns of COVID-19 experiences and psychosocial functioning during the prolonged lockdown, and (3) explore sex and racial/ethnic differences in COVID-19-related experiences and mental health correlates. A total of 909 ethnically and racially diverse students completed an online survey in May 2020. Findings highlight significant impediments to multiple areas of students' daily life during this period (i.e., home life, work life, social environment, and emotional and physical health) and a vast majority reported heightened symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety. These life disruptions were significantly related to poorer mental health. Moreover, those who reported the loss of a close friend or loved one from COVID-19 (17%) experienced significantly more psychological distress than counterparts with other types of infection-related histories. Nonetheless, the majority (96%) reported at least one positive experience since the pandemic began. Our findings add to a growing understanding of COVID-19 impacts on psychological health and contribute the important perspective of the North American epicenter of the pandemic during the time frame of this investigation. We discuss how the results may inform best practices to support students' well-being and serve as a benchmark for future studies of US student populations facing COVID-19 and its aftermath.","López-Castro, Teresa; Brandt, Laura; Anthonipillai, Nishanthi J; Espinosa, Adriana; Melara, Robert",PLoS One,555,16

METHODS: The deep learning system was previously trained and validated on 14,341 ocular fundus photographs from 19 international centers. The performance of the system was evaluated on 800 new fundus photographs (400 normal optic discs, 201 papilledema [disc edema from elevated intracranial pressure], 199 other optic disc abnormalities) and compared with that of 2 expert neuro-ophthalmologists who independently reviewed the same randomly presented images without clinical information. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. RESULTS: The system correctly classified 678 of 800 (84.7%) photographs, compared with 675 of 800 (84.4%) for Expert 1 and 641 of 800 (80.1%) for Expert 2. The system yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.96-0.98), 0.96 (95% CI = 0.94-0.97), and 0.89 (95% CI = 0.87-0.92) for the detection of normal discs, papilledema, and other disc abnormalities, respectively. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the system's classification of optic discs were similar to or better than the 2 experts.

Here, we combine several of these (epidemic) models to create a (pandemic) model of viral spread among regions. Our focus is on a second wave of new cases that may result from loss of immunity-and the exchange of people between regions-and how mortality rates can be ameliorated under different strategic responses. In particular, we consider hard or soft social distancing strategies predicated on national (Federal) or regional (State) estimates of the prevalence of infection in the population. The modelling is demonstrated using timeseries of new cases and deaths from the United States to estimate the parameters of a factorial (compartmental) epidemiological model of each State and, crucially, coupling between States. Using Bayesian model reduction, we identify the effective connectivity between States that best explains the initial phases of the outbreak in the United States. Using the ensuing posterior parameter estimates, we then evaluate the likely outcomes of different policies in terms of mortality, working days lost due to lockdown and demands upon critical care. The provisional results of this modelling suggest that social distancing and loss of immunity are the two key factors that underwrite a return to endemic equilibrium.","Friston, K.

Aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of anticoagulation in coronavirus disease 2019 hospitalized patients and its impact on survival. DESIGN: Multicenter international prospective registry (Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation for Corona Virus Disease 2019). SETTING: Hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019. PATIENTS: Five thousand eight hundred thirty-eight consecutive coronavirus disease 2019 patients. INTERVENTIONS: Anticoagulation therapy, including prophylactic and therapeutic regimens, was obtained for each patient. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Five thousand four hundred eighty patients (94%) did not receive any anticoagulation before hospitalization. Two-thousand six-hundred one patients (44%) during hospitalization received anticoagulation therapy and it was not associated with better survival rate (81% vs 81%; p = 0.94) but with higher risk of bleeding (2.7% vs 1.8%; p = 0.03).

This study analyses the temporal dynamic of detected vs. undetected cases to provide guidance for the interpretation of prevalence studies performed with PCR or antibody tests to estimate the detection rate. METHODS: We used an agent-based model to evaluate assumptions on the detection probability ranging from 0.1 to 0.9. For each general detection probability, we derived age-dependent detection probabilities and calibrated the model to reproduce the epidemic wave of COVID-19 in Austria from March 2020 to June 2020. We categorized infected individuals into presymptomatic, symptomatic unconfirmed, confirmed and never detected to observe the simulated dynamic of the detected and undetected cases. RESULTS: The calculation of the age-dependent detection probability ruled values lower than 0.4 as most likely. Furthermore, the proportion of undetected cases depends strongly on the dynamic of the epidemic wave: during the initial upswing, the undetected cases account for a major part of all infected individuals, whereas their share decreases around the peak of the confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS: The results of prevalence studies performed to determine the detection rate of COVID-19 patients should always be interpreted with regard to the current dynamic of the epidemic wave. Applying the method proposed in our analysis, the prevalence study performed in Austria in April 2020 could indicate a detection rate of 0.13, instead of the prevalent ratio of 0.29 between detected and estimated undetected cases at that time.","Rippinger, C; Bicher, M; Urach, C; Brunmeir, D; Weibrecht, N; Zauner, G; Sroczynski, G; Jahn, B; Mühlberger, N; Siebert, U; Popper, N",BMC Infect Dis,555,10

Adherence is a key to ensure effectiveness. The objective of this study was, first of all, to evaluate the adherence with subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and to identify the main causes of SCIT withdrawal in real-life practice in our clinic. Secondly, to investigate to what extent COVID-19 pandemic altered our SCIT receiving patients' treatment adherence behaviors and the factors that affected their decisions. Methods: Retrospective analysis of the medical records of patients ages &#8805;18 years, who had started SCIT in January 2014 or later until September 2020 in our department for the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma or venom allergy were included in the study. Adherence was determined as the accomplishment of three years of SCIT. Results: A total of 124 patients (72 female [58.1%]; median age, 35 [19-77] years) were included. The adherence rate to SCIT in our tertiary center's real-life setting was 56.25% with a follow-up duration of 3 years before COVID-19 pandemic. Dose modification, defined as reducing patient's planned SCIT dose due to a systemic allergic/large local reaction or missed injection, and its frequency, which is the number of dose adjustments done throughout the SCIT, was found to be the only factor related to nonadherence. But with the pandemic only in 6 months, among 63 patients receiving SCIT, 15 patients (23.81%) dropped out and the most common reason was fear of being infected with COVID-19 virus during receiving SCIT in hospital (93.33%). The only independent predictor of drop-out during COVID-19 pandemic was short duration of AIT (p=0.012). When we compare the dropped-out cases before and after the start of pandemic AIT duration was significantly shorter in pandemic period (p= 0.005). Conclusion: Adherence rate to SCIT in our real-world setting study was 56.25% before COVID-19 pandemic. Our results indicated that patients requiring dose modification were more prone to be non-adherent. Approximately a quarter of patients dropped-out with the start of pandemic, almost all due to fear of being infected during receiving SCIT in hospital. Since short SCIT follow-up time was found to be the only risk factor for drop-out during COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that patients who are in the early phases of their treatment should be observed more closely and their concerns should be answered by their doctors.","Koca Kalkan, Ilkay; Ates, Hale; Aksu, Kurtulus; Yesilkaya, Selma; Topel, Musa; Cuhadar Ercelebi, Dilek; Turkyilmaz, Suleyman; Oncul, Ali; Demir, Senay",World Allergy Organ J,555,23

The current studies used a modified associative recognition paradigm that allowed disentangling item impairment from associative impairment in DF. Participants studied scene-object pairings, followed by DF cues (item-method), and at test were presented with a previously studied scene along with three objects, one of which was studied with that scene (target), whereas the remaining two objects were studied with different scenes (lures). Experiment 1 used an associative encoding orienting task, and DF impairment was observed only when the forget targets were paired with forget lures within the test display; however, DF was eliminated when the forget targets were paired with remember lures, possibly due to a recall-to-reject strategy. Experiment 2 used an object-focused orienting task that downplayed the encoding of associative information. The results revealed the opposite of Experiment 1, with significant DF when the forget targets were paired with remember lures, and no DF when the lures and the target came from the same memory instruction. Experiment 3 used the same orienting task as Experiment 1, but testing used a sequential procedure, where item recognition was assessed first, followed by associative recognition test. Conditionalizing associative recognition on item recognition outcomes confirmed that DF impairment of associative memory can be obtained despite retained memory for forget-cued objects. Overall, the results provide strong support for the impairment of associative memory by DF.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Large-scale observational data collection requires: 1) quality assurance and harmonization across many sites; 2) a transparent process for selecting from among many potential research questions; 3) the use of best practices in design of descriptive, predictive, and inferential studies; (4) innovative approaches to characterize random error in the setting of constantly updated data; (5) rapid peer-review and reporting; and (6) transitions from a focus on discovery to implementation. Herein, we describe the guiding principles to best practices and suggestions for innovations to study design and reporting within the coronavirus disease 2019 Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study pandemic registry. CONCLUSIONS: Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study coronavirus disease 2019 registry sought to develop and implement prespecified best practices combined with grassroots efforts from clinical sites worldwide in order to develop clinically useful knowledge in response to a pandemic.","Walkey, Allan J; Sheldrick, R Christopher; Kashyap, Rahul; Kumar, Vishakha K; Boman, Karen; Bolesta, Scott; Zampieri, Fernando G; Bansal, Vikas; Harhay, Michael O; Gajic, Ognjen",Crit Care Med,555,17

This study assessed risks for mental health problems (traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, alcohol use, insomnia) in association with pandemic-related stressors in a sample of emergency and hospital personnel (N = 571). Respondents completed self-report surveys online from April 1st to May 7th, 2020 in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. Results showed that roughly fifteen to thirty percent of respondents screened positive for each disorder. Odds of screening positive were similar between groups for probable acute traumatic stress, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and alcohol use disorder; emergency personnel reported significantly higher rates of insufficient sleep than healthcare workers. Logistic regressions showed that respondents who reported having an immunocompromised condition had higher odds of acute traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression. Having an immunocompromised household member was associated with higher odds of insufficient sleep and anxiety. Being in a direct care provision role was associated with higher odds of screening positive for risky alcohol use. Being in a management role over direct care providers was associated with higher odds of screening positive for anxiety, risky alcohol use, and insufficient sleep. There was an inverse relationship between number of positive COVID-19 cases and anxiety, such that as positive cases went up, anxiety decreased. Overall, the mental health risks that we observed early in the COVID-19 pandemic are elevated above previous viral outbreaks (SARS) and comparable to rates shown in disasters (9/11 attacks; Hurricane Katrina).","Wright, Hannah M; Griffin, Brandon J; Shoji, Kotaro; Love, Tiffany M; Langenecker, Scott A; Benight, Charles C; Smith, Andrew J",J. psychiatr. res,555,29

The initial data pointed out the tight bond between cardiovascular diseases and worse health outcomes in COVID19-patients. Epidemiologically speaking, there is an overlap between the age-groups more affected by COVID-related death and the age-groups in which Cardiac Surgery has its usual base of patients. The Cardiac Surgery Departments have to think to a new normal: since the virus will remain endemic in the society, dedicated pathways or even dedicated Teams are pivotal to treat safely the patients, in respect of the safety of the health care workers. Moreover, we need a keen eye on deciding which pathologies have to be treated with priority: Coronary artery Disease showed a higher mortality rate in patients affected by COVID19, but it is, however, reasonable to think that all the cardiac pathologies affecting the lung circulation-such as symptomatic severe mitral diseases or aortic stenosis-might deserve a priority access to treatment, to increase the survival rate in case of an acquired-Coronavirus infection later on.","Tamagnini, Gabriele; Biondi, Raoul; Ricciardi, Gabriella; Rutigliano, Roberta; Trias-Llimós, Sergi; Meuris, Bart; Lamelas, Joseph; Del Giglio, Mauro",J Card Surg,555,26

The aim is to provide to interested scientists from different fields, including chemistry, physics, biochemistry, and medicine, an overview over the basic properties of surfactants and (corona)viruses, which are relevant to understanding the interactions between the two. Various types of interactions between surfactant and virus are important, and they act on different components of a virus such as the lipid envelope, membrane (envelope) proteins and nucleo-capsid proteins. Accordingly, this cannot be a detailed account of all relevant aspects, but instead a summary that bridges between the different disciplines. We describe concepts and cover a selection of the relevant literature as an incentive for diving deeper into the relevant material. Our focus is on more recent developments around the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, applications of surfactants against the virus, and on the potential future use of surfactants for pandemic relief. However, we also cover the most important aspects of the historical development of using surfactants in combatting virus infections. We conclude that surfactants are already playing very important roles in various directions of defence against viruses, either directly, as in disinfection, or as carrier components of drug delivery systems for prophylaxis or treatment. By designing tailor-made surfactants and, consequently, advanced formulations, one can expect a more and more effective use of surfactants, either directly as antiviral compounds or as part of more complex formulations.","Simon, Miriam; Veit, Michael; Osterrieder, Klaus; Gradzielski, Michael",Curr Opin Colloid Interface Sci,555,16

As a result of hospital and state mandates, our radiology residency program quickly transitioned to a virtual learning platform to continue dissemination of knowledge, maintain resident engagement, and ensure professional development. The goal of this study is to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the virtual learning platform at our institution using resident ratings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This institutional IRB-exempt study involved a survey of 17 questions which was electronically distributed to 45 radiology residents using SurveyMonkey. Questions encompassed resident satisfaction with teaching and professional development, scheduling changes, and engagement with the virtual platform. Answers to most questions were submitted on a Likert scale. RESULTS: A total of 31 of 45 respondents completed the survey (response rateâ¯=â¯69%). Most residents were satisfied with the virtual platform with teaching activities identified as a strength and the incorporation of professional development as a weakness. The most frequent barriers to attending the virtual curriculum were technical difficulties (43%) and childcare (36%). Residents who reported experiencing barriers were less likely to adhere to the virtual curriculum (pâ¯=â¯0.004). Most respondents (81%) reported a desire to maintain elements of the virtual learning practice postpandemic. CONCLUSION: The majority of residents reported high satisfaction with virtual learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Teaching activities are a curricular strength. Weaknesses identified include the incorporation of professional development and extrinsic barriers, such as technical difficulties and family obligations, which require further support for trainees.","Larocque, Natasha; Shenoy-Bhangle, Anuradha; Brook, Alexander; Eisenberg, Ronald; Chang, Yu-Ming; Mehta, Pritesh",Acad. radiol,555,26

This has particularly been the case during COVID-19, when traditional methods of recruitment have not been able to be used. Despite this, there is limited evidence on the feasibility of social media for recruiting a national sample. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the use of social media as a tool for recruiting a national sample of adults to an online survey during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Between August - October 2020, participants were recruited through Facebook via two advertisement campaigns into an online survey exploring the relationship between social determinants of health and wellbeing of adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analysed using SPSS version 25 and Facebook metrics auto generated in the Facebook Ads Manager. Post stratification weights were calculated to match the Australian population on the basis of gender, age and state or territory based on 2016 Australian census data. RESULTS: In total, 9594 people were reached nationally with the paid option and potentially 902000 people through the no cost option resulting in 1211 online survey responses. The total cost of the advertisement campaign was $649.66, resulting in an overall cost per click of $0.25 AUD. CONCLUSIONS: Facebook is a feasible and cost-effective method of recruiting participants into an online survey, enabling recruitment of population groups considered hard to reach or marginalised. Recruitment through Facebook facilitated diversity, with participants varying in socioeconomic status, geographical location, educational attainment and age.","Green, Heidi; Fernandez, Ritin; MacPhail, Catherine",,555,6

METHODS: 66 women with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) - confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and their 42 neonates were included in the prospective observational study. Demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and instrumental data of pregnancy, delivery, postpartum period, including pharmacotherapy and neonatal outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: 15 (22.7%) women were asymptomatic, 25 (38%) had mild disease, while moderate and severe forms were detected in 20 (30.2%) and 6 (9.1%) cases, respectively. Additional oxygenation was required in 6 (9%) cases: 4 (6%) received CPAP therapy and 2 (3%) - mechanical ventilation. Main clinical symptoms were cough (51.5%), anosmia (34.9%), and hyperthermia (33.3%). Laboratory changes included increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine, d-dimer, and C-reactive protein (CRP), anemia, and leukopenia. All pregnant women received low molecular weight heparin and interferon alfa-2b according to the National clinical recommendations. Antimicrobial drugs included Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid (46%) and macrolides (28%) or carbapenems in severe cases of disease. Spontaneous abortion was reported in 6.1% of cases. Eight preterm (19%) and 34 term deliveries (81%) occurred. The mean weight of neonates was (3283 ± 477) g, 1- and 5-min Apgar score was (7.8 ± 0.6) and (8.7 ± 0.5), respectively. No cases of neonatal COVID-19 infection were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Mostly, the manifestations of COVID-19 were mild. However, 9% of cases were severe, and could contribute to preterm delivery or maternal morbidity. Main predictors of severe COVID-19 course in pregnant women were a decrease in the levels of erythrocytes and lymphocytes and increase in the levels of alanine aminotransferase and CRP. Elimination of the virus in pregnant women required more time due to altered immunity. No evidence of vertical transmission during pregnancy and delivery was found. However, the possibility of this cannot be excluded.","Shmakov, Roman G; Prikhodko, Andrey; Polushkina, Evgeniya; Shmakova, Elena; Pyregov, Aleksey; Bychenko, Vladimir; Priputnevich, Tatyana V; Dolgushin, Grigory O; Yarotskaya, Ekaterina; Pekarev, Oleg; Bolibok, Nikolai; Degtyarev, Dmitriy; Sukhikh, Gennady T",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,555,15

As Lee Bush states, ‘with so little scholarship on surfing women, descriptive studies are needed as a foundation for launching future interpretive and critical studies.’[1] Twelve women who surf in Ireland spoke about the links their surfing may or may not have with their national identity. Previous academic inquiry on links between national identity and sport on the island of Ireland has almost exclusively focused on men’s experiences of team sports and issues of ‘Irishness’.[2] ‘Irishness’ is globally recognised and stereotypically linked to traditional and indigenous Irish sports such as Gaelic football and a range of other cultural activities. Research into women’s sport participation has largely been restricted to the study of soccer in the Republic of Ireland,[3] and gendered evaluations of various lifestyle and health surveys.[4] Katie Liston, a key researcher in sport and gender relations in Ireland, highlights that ‘there seems to be an increasing diversity in the kinds of activities in which people participate in’,[5] and that there is a shift towards ‘lifestyle’ activities for adults as diversity increases in young people’s participation in sports and leisure activities. Against the backdrop of Liston’s work, this article delves deeper into data collected as part of a wider research project, discussing whether or not women who surf in Ireland do so as part of a process designed to construct and reflect their national identities related to this arguably ‘postmodern’[6] ‘lifestyle sport’,[7] in which Ireland will be represented on the Olympic stage for the first time in 2021.

The overwhelming increasing amount of infections has led to a major strain on major healthcare services. This leads to shortages in hospital beds, ventilators and critical personnel protective equipment. This article focuses on the critical adaptations from a general surgery department in Malaysia which is part of a Malaysian tertiary hospital that treats COVID-19 cases. The core highlights of these strategies enforced during this pandemic are: (1) surgery ward and clinic decongestions; (2) deferment of elective surgeries; (3) restructuring of medical personnel work force; (4) utilization of online applications for tele-communication; (5) operating room (OR) adjustments and patient screening; and (6) continuing medical education and updating practices in context to COVID-19. These adaptations were important for the continuation of emergency surgery services, preventing transmission of COVID-19 amongst healthcare workers and optimization of medical personnel work force in times of a global pandemic. In addition, an early analysis on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures in Malaysia towards the reduction in total number of elective/emergent/trauma surgeries performed is described in this article.","Tan Chor Lip, Henry; Huei, Tan Jih; Mohamad, Yuzaidi; Alwi, Rizal Imran; Tuan Mat, Tuan Nur039; Azmah,",Chin J Traumatol,555,20

DESIGN: Systematic review. ELIGIBILITY: Eligible studies compared utilisation of services during COVID-19 pandemic to at least one comparable period in prior years. Services included visits, admissions, diagnostics and therapeutics. Studies were excluded if from single centres or studied only patients with COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and preprints were searched, without language restrictions, until 10 August, using detailed searches with key concepts including COVID-19, health services and impact. DATA ANALYSIS: Risk of bias was assessed by adapting the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Interventions tool, and a Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care tool. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics, graphical figures and narrative synthesis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was change in service utilisation between prepandemic and pandemic periods. Secondary outcome was the change in proportions of users of healthcare services with milder or more severe illness (eg, triage scores). RESULTS: 3097 unique references were identified, and 81 studies across 20 countries included, reporting on >11 million services prepandemic and 6.9 million during pandemic. For the primary outcome, there were 143 estimates of changes, with a median 37% reduction in services overall (IQR -51% to -20%), comprising median reductions for visits of 42% (-53% to -32%), admissions 28% (-40% to -17%), diagnostics 31% (-53% to -24%) and for therapeutics 30% (-57% to -19%). Among 35 studies reporting secondary outcomes, there were 60 estimates, with 27 (45%) reporting larger reductions in utilisation among people with a milder spectrum of illness, and 33 (55%) reporting no difference. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare utilisation decreased by about a third during the pandemic, with considerable variation, and with greater reductions among people with less severe illness. While addressing unmet need remains a priority, studies of health impacts of reductions may help health systems reduce unnecessary care in the postpandemic recovery.

Researchers from around the world have tried to study the virus and its effect with more precision in various fields. The purpose of this study is to identify levels of anxiety and depression with regard to precautionary for prevention of COVID-19, and to identify the relationship between demographic variables and both depression and anxiety. Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study; data were collected by questionnaire via a mobile phone application in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq from 25 March, 2020 to 5 April, 2020. The sample size was 894 after deleting 20 cases because of duplication. The questionnaire consists of three main parts; part one is related to the sociodemographic characteristics of participants, the second and third parts consist of items related to depression and anxiety about COVID-19 using a 5-point Likert Scale (1 = of course no, 2 = no , 3 = normal for me, 4 = yes, and 5 = of course yes). Data was analyzed using SPSS V.25. Results: The majority of the participants were from Erbil (58.8%), most of them were male (58.4%); nearly 21.2% preferred quarantine and 41.7% chose curfew as a best way to to avoid being infected by COVID-19. Most of the participants had depression because of people's lack of knowledge about how to protect themselves from the virus (88.14%), while the majority of them had anxiety concerning shopping and contact with infected people (97%) and financial problems (97%). Females had higher rates of COVID-19 depression than did males. There was a significant correlation between age and home setting and anxiety, and a significant association between marital status and level of education and depression. There was no significant association between other variables and depression and anxiety. Conclusion: The findings of the study indicated that the majority of participants were depressed and had anxiety about COVID-19. There was a significant association between gender and depression and anxiety, while there was no significant association between occupation and income, and depression and anxiety.","Blbas, Hazhar Talaat Abubaer; Aziz, Kareem F; Nejad, Sahar H; Barzinjy, Azeez A",Z Gesundh Wiss,555,21

Here, we evaluated infection control measures in a prospective longitudinal single-center study at the Vienna General Hospital, the biggest tertiary care center in Austria, with a structurally planned low SARS-CoV-2 exposure. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were assessed by Abbott ARCHITECT chemiluminescent assay (CLIA) in 599 health care workers (HCWs) at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in early April and two months later. Neutralization assay confirmed CLIA-positive samples. A structured questionnaire was completed at both visits assessing demographic parameters, family situation, travel history, occupational coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exposure, and personal protective equipment handling. At the first visit, 6 of 599 participants (1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies.

An end-to-end system model which considers the pathogen-laden cough/sneeze droplets as the input and the infection state of the human as the output is proposed. This model uses the gravity, initial velocity and buoyancy for the propagation of droplets and a receiver model which considers the central part of the human face as the reception interface is proposed. Furthermore, the probability of infection for an uninfected human is derived by modeling the number of propagating droplets as a random process. The numerical results reveal that exposure time and sex of the human affect the probability of infection. In addition, the social distance for a horizontal cough should be at least 1.7 m and the safe coughing angle of a coughing human to infect less people should be less than -25$^\circ$.","Gulec, Fatih; Atakan, Baris",,555,1

Early data on COVID-19 suggest heterogeneity in the severity of symptoms during transmission and infection ranging from no symptoms to death. The source of this heterogeneity is likely multifaceted and may have a genetic component. Demographic and clinical comorbidities associated with the severity of infection suggest that possible variants known to influence the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system pathway (particularly those that influence ACE2) may contribute to the heterogenous infection response. ACE2 and angiotensin(1-7) (the product of ACE2) seem to have a protective effect on the pulmonary and cardiac systems.

This paper will propose a thorough analysis of operating dentistry procedures, comparing the economic performance of the activity in a dental surgery before and after the adoption of these protective measures, which are required to contain the risk of SARS-COV-2 infections. METHODS: The economic analysis is articulated in three approaches. Firstly, it assesses a reduction in markup by maintaining current charges (A); alternatively, it suggests revised charges to adopt in order to maintain unvaried levels of markup (B). And the third Approach (C) examines available dental treatments, highlighting how to profitably combine treatment volumes to reduce markup loss or a restricted increase in dental charges. RESULTS: Maintaining dental charges could cause a loss in markup, even rising to 200% (A); attempting to maintain unvaried levels of markup will result in an increase in dental charges, even at 100% (B); and varying the volumes of the single dental treatments on offer (increasing those which current research indicates as the most profitable) could mitigate the economic impact of the measures to prevent the transmission of SARS-COV-2 (C). CONCLUSIONS: The authors of this paper provide managerial insights which can assist the dentist-entrepreneur to become aware of the boundaries of the economic consequences of governmental measures in containing the virus infection.","Lo Nigro, Giovanna; Bizzoca, Maria Eleonora; Lo Muzio, Lorenzo; Campisi, Giuseppina",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),555,3

In this case study, the virtual ethnographic method was used with the intention of carrying out a detailed study and advancing theoretical knowledge of the phenomenon in question. The recovery and analysis of the information was carried out during the months of March to July 2020. A total of 113 memes were captured, of which 55 (48.7%) expressed emotions linked to the pandemic. The results show that the meme is a complex system involving cognitive processes and language games specific to the culture in which they are used, promoting expressiveness and ways of sharing and being affectionate during the pandemic. The expression of negative emotions such as pessimism, despair, fear and loneliness prevails;positive emotions such as astonishment, optimism and serenity are also expressed. The results lead to a partial verification of the research assumption in the understanding that the predominant emotions, although negative, are not the emotions that have been identified as part of the historical-socio-cultural premises of emotional expression in Mexicans. We discuss the edifying function of memes in delineating expressive patterns of valuation and planning of the new reality by constituting referents that operate as cultural units that articulate communicative acts to provide meaning and identity to users.","Rodriguez-Hernandez, G.; Calderon, K.

The N-terminal flexible histone tails stick out from the histone core and have extensive posttranslational modifications, causing epigenetic changes of chromatin. Although crystal and cryogenic electron microscopy structures of nucleosomes are available, the flexible tail structures remain elusive. Using NMR, we have examined the dynamics of histone H3 tails in nucleosomes containing unmodified and tetra-acetylated H4 tails. In unmodified nucleosome, the H3 tail adopts a dynamic equilibrium structure between DNA-contact and reduced-contact states. In acetylated H4 nucleosome, however, the H3 tail equilibrium shifts to a mainly DNA-contact state with a minor reduced-contact state. The acetylated H4 tail is dynamically released from its own DNA-contact state to a reduced-contact state, while the H3 tail DNA-contact state becomes major. Notably, H3 K14 in the acetylated H4 nucleosome is much more accessible to acetyltransferase Gcn5 relative to unmodified nucleosome, possibly due to the formation of a favorable H3 tail conformation for Gcn5. In summary, each histone tail adopts a characteristic dynamic state but regulates one other, probably creating a histone tail network even on a nucleosome.","Furukawa, Ayako; Wakamori, Masatoshi; Arimura, Yasuhiro; Ohtomo, Hideaki; Tsunaka, Yasuo; Kurumizaka, Hitoshi; Umehara, Takashi; Nishimura, Yoshifumi",Proc.

There was minimal field contamination in the cadaveric models, 0% to 2.77% field tarp area, regardless of drill burr type or drilling location; cutting burr drilling without suction in the 3D model yielded the worst contamination field (36.1%), followed by coarse diamond drilling without suction (19.4%). The simple placement of a flexible suction instrument in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx led to complete elimination of all aerosols &#8804;14.1 µm, as evaluated by a cascade impactor positioned immediately at the nares. CONCLUSION: Given the findings regarding aerosol risk reduction, we strongly recommend that physicians use a suction instrument in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx during endonasal surgery in the COVID-19 era.","Dharmarajan, Harish; Freiser, Monika E; Sim, Edward; Boorgu, Devi Sai Sri Kavya; Corcoran, Timothy E; Wang, Eric W; Gardner, Paul A; Snyderman, Carl H",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,555,2

There have been studies of patients on in-center hemodialysis, but home dialysis population data are scarce. Our objective is to study the incidence and course of COVID-19 in a home dialysis unit (HDU) at the height of the pandemic. METHODS: An observational, retrospective study enrolling all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from the HDU of Hospital Universitario La Paz (La Paz University Hospital) (Madrid, Spain) between March 10 and May 15, 2020. We collected clinical data from the HDU (57 patients on peritoneal dialysis and 22 patients on home hemodialysis) and compared the clinical characteristics and course of patients with and without COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Twelve patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 (9 peritoneal dialysis; 3 home hemodialysis). There were no statistically significant differences in terms of clinical characteristics between patients with COVID-19 and the rest of the unit. The mean age was 62±18.5 years; most were men (75%). All patients but one required hospitalization. Ten patients (83%) were discharged following a mean of 16.4±9.7 days of hospitalization. Two patients were diagnosed while hospitalized for other conditions, and these were the only patients who died. Those who died were older than those who survived. CONCLUSION: The incidence of COVID-19 in our HDU in Madrid at the height of the pandemic was high, especially in patients on peritoneal dialysis. No potential benefit for preventing the infection in patients on home dialysis was observed. Advanced age and nosocomial transmission were the main factors linked to a worse prognosis.","Maldonado, María; Ossorio, Marta; Del Peso, Gloria; Santos, Carlos; Álvarez, Laura; Sánchez-Villanueva, Rafael; Rivas, Begoña; Vega, Cristina; Selgas, Rafael; Bajo, María A",Nefrologia (Madrid),555,1

There are risks and benefits associated with both the type of interventions. Hence, this review was conducted to compare outcomes of immediate and delayed induction of labour among women with hypertensive disorder of pregnancy based on disease severity and gestational age. METHODS: We conducted systematic searches in various databases including Medline, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), Scopus, and Embase from inception until October 2019.Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the quality of published trials. A meta-analysis was performed with random-effects model and reported pooled Risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Fourteen randomized controlled trials with 4244 participants were included. Majority of the studies had low or unclear bias risks. Amongst late onset mild pre-eclampsia patients, the risk of renal failure was significantly lower with immediate induction of labour (pooled RR: 0.36; 95%CI: 0.14 to 0.92). In severe pre-eclampsia patients, immediate induction of labour significantly reduced the risk of having small-for-gestational age babies compared to delayed induction of labour (pooled RR: 0.49; 95%CI: 0.29-0.84).Delayed induction was found to significantly reduce the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome risk among late onset mild pre-eclampsia patients (pooled RR: 2.15; 95%CI: 1.14 to 4.06) None of the other outcomes demonstrated statistically significant difference between the two interventions. CONCLUSION: Delayed induction of labour with expectant monitoring may not be inferior to immediate induction of labour in terms of neonatal and maternal outcomes. Expectant approach of management for late onset mild pre-eclampsia patients may be associated with decreased risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, while immediate induction of labour among severe pre-eclampsia patients is associated with reduced risk of small-for-gestational age babies and among mild pre-eclampsia patients, it is associated with reduced risk of severe renal impairment.","Li, Jia; Shao, Xuecheng; Song, Shurong; Liang, Qian; Liu, Yang; Qi, Xiaojin",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,555,32

CORE Group Polio Project teams have been called upon to address the COVID-19 pandemic, and, like with polio, the pandemic response is impacted by stigma in all areas of response, from health education, testing, contact tracing, and even treatment for infected individuals. The CGPP has reached back into its polio experience and is redeploying successful community engagement activities to address stigma as part of the COVID-19 response. Across country programs, community health volunteers communicate risk and behavior change at the household level by integrating health education and promotion activities with a focus on practical measures of COVID-19 prevention. Moreover, leveraging established and trusted partnerships with community networks and community leaders are providing lessons that can be adopted by the global community.

However, medical information regarding the urogenital involvement in recovered COVID-19 patients is limited or unknown. OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively evaluate urogenital involvement in recovered COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Men aged between 20 years and 50 years who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovered when the study was conducted were enrolled in our study. Demographic and clinical characteristics, and history of hospitalization were collected and analyzed. Urine, expressed prostatic secretions (EPSs), and semen samples were collected for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Semen quality and hormonal profiles were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 74 male recovered COVID-19 patients, 11 (14.9%) were asymptomatic, classified into mild type, and 31 (41.9%) were classified into moderate type. The remaining patients (32/74, 43.2%) had severe pneumonia. No critically ill recovered COVID-19 patient was recruited in our cohort. The median interval between last positive pharyngeal swab RT-PCR test and semen samples collection was 80 days (IQR, 64-93). The median age was 31 years (IQR, 27-36; range, 21-49), and the median body mass index (BMI) was 24.40 (IQR, 22.55-27.30). Forty-five (61.6%) men were married, and 28 (38.4%) were unmarried. Fifty-three (72.6%) patients denied cigarette smoking, 18 (24.7%) were active smokers, and 2 of them were past smokers. The majority of our participants (53/74, 72.6%) did not consume alcohol. Fever occurred in most of the patients (75.3%), and 63 of them had abnormal chest CT images. Only one patient complained of scrotal discomfort during the course of COVID-19, which was ruled out orchitis by MRI (data not shown). A total of 205 samples were collected for SARS-CoV-2 detection (74 urine samples, 70 semen samples, and 61 EPS samples). However, viral nucleic acid was not detected in body fluids from the urogenital system. In terms of hormonal profiles, the levels of FSH, LH, testosterone, and estradiol were 5.20 [4.23] mIU/mL, 3.95 [1.63] mIU/mL, 3.65 [1.19] ng/mL, and 39.48 [12.51] pg/mL, respectively. And these values were within the normal limits. The overall semen quality of recovered COVID-19 patients was above the lower reference limit released by the WHO. While compared with healthy control, sperm concentration, total sperm count, and total motility were significantly declined. In addition, different clinical types of COVID-19 have no significant difference in semen parameters, but total sperm count showed a descending trend. Interestingly, subjects with a longer recovery time showed worse data for sperm quality. Small sample size and lacking semen parameters before the infection are the major limitations of our study. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest cohort study with longest follow-up for urogenital evaluation comprehensively so far. Direct urogenital involvement was not found in the recovered COVID-19 male patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was undetectable in the urogenital secretions, and semen quality declined slightly, while hormonal profiles remained normal. Moreover, patients with a long time (&#8805;90 days) since recovery had lower total sperm count. Great attention and further study should be conducted and follow-up on the reproductive function in the following months.","Ruan, Yajun; Hu, Bintao; Liu, Zhuo; Liu, Kang; Jiang, Hongyang; Li, Hao; Li, Rui; Luan, Yang; Liu, Xiaming; Yu, Gan; Xu, Shengfei; Yuan, Xiaoyi; Wang, Shaogang; Yang, Weimin; Ye, Zhangqun; Liu, Jihong; Wang, Tao",Androl.

We conducted a scoping review to identify what is known about the debt burden on those who have been incarcerated and their families and how this impacts their lives. We searched 14 data bases from 1990 to 2019 for all original research addressing financial debt held by those incarcerated in the United States, and screened articles for relevance and extracted data from pertinent studies. These 31 studies selected for inclusion showed that this population is heavily burdened by debt that was accumulated in three general categories: debt directly from criminal justice involvement such as LFOs, preexisting debt that compounded during incarceration, and debts accrued during reentry for everyday survival. Debt was generally shown to have a negative effect on financial well-being, reentry, family structure, and mental health. Debts from LFOs and child support is very common among the justice-involved population and are largely unpayable. Other forms of debt likely to burden this population remain largely understudied. Extensive reform is necessary to lessen the burden of debt on the criminal justice population in order to improve reentry outcomes and quality of life.","Harper, Annie; Ginapp, Callie; Bardelli, Tommaso; Grimshaw, Alyssa; Justen, Marissa; Mohamedali, Alaa; Thomas, Isaiah; Puglisi, Lisa",Am J Crim Justice,555,24

ObjectiveTo assess the diagnostic sensitivity of a novel Beanguard gargle (BG)-based virus detection method for early diagnosis of COVID-19. DesignThis clinical trial was conducted at Gunsan Medical Center, Namwon Medical Center, and Jeonbuk National University Hospital, between May 7 and July 7, 2021. SettingPaired NPS and BG-based saliva specimens collected from COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals were analyzed using NPS-RT-PCR, BG-RT-PCR, and BG-Ag-RDTs. ParticipantsThe study comprised 102 COVID-19-positive patients hospitalized after governmental screening process and 100 healthy individuals. Forty-five COVID-19 patients were sampled within 6 days of illness and 57 within 7-15 days; 27 were categorized as asymptomatic and 75, as symptomatic. Eight and 2 patients carried the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta variants, respectively. InterventionThe diagnostic performances of BG-Ag-RDT, BG-RT-PCR, and NPS-RT-PCR for detecting SARS-CoV-2 were compared. Main outcomesThe sensitivities of BG-Ag-RDT and BG-RT-PCR towards salivary viral detection were highly concordant, with no discrimination between symptomatic, asymptomatic, or SARS-CoV-2 variant cases. ResultsAmong total participants (mean age, 43.7 years), 51% were women. BG-Ag-RDTs showed high sensitivity (97.8%, [95% CI, 88.4% to 99.6%]) and specificity (100%, [95% CI, 96.3% to 100%) in 45 patients within 6 days of illness and could detect all cases of SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta variants. In 11 asymptomatic early-stage cases, both BG-Ag-RDTs and BG-RT-PCR showed excellent sensitivity and specificity of 100% (95% CI, 74.1% to 100% and 95% CI, 20.7% to 100%, respectively). The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and truncated canavalin, an active ingredient from bean extract (BE) and the ultrastructural features of SARS-CoV-2 particles coated with BE were observed. The detachment of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain from hACE2 increased as the BE concentration increased, allowing the release of the virus from hACE2 for early diagnosis. Conclusions and RelevanceUsing BG-based saliva remarkably enhances the Ag-RDT diagnostic performance as an alternative to NPS and enables rapid and accurate COVID-19 self-testing and mass screening, supporting efficient COVID-19 management. Trial RegistrationKCT0006438 Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow can we collect SARS-CoV-2 from oral cavity to improve the sensitivity of antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (Ag-RDT)? FindingsIn this clinical study involving 102 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the Ag-RDT test using Beanguard gargle-based saliva specimens showed significantly enhanced sensitivity and specificity towards detection of SARS-CoV-2 along with Alpha and Delta variants in all patients tested within 6 days of illness.

However, there are uncertainties pertaining to the risks of post-bariatric severe hypoglycaemia (SH), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), end-stage kidney diseases (ESKDs) and all-cause mortality in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), especially among Asian populations. METHODS: A retrospective population-based cohort of 1702 obese T2DM patients who were free of CVD and ESKD were assembled based on the 2006-17 Hospital Authority database. One-to-five propensity-score matching was used to balance baseline covariates between patients in bariatric surgery and control groups. Incidence rates (IRs) of SH, CVD, Stage 4/5 chronic kidney diseases (CKD), ESKD and all-cause mortality events for two groups were calculated. Hazard ratios (HR) for SH, CVD and Stage 4/5 CKD events were assessed using Cox-proportional hazard models. Changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) were measured up to 60 months. RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up period of 32 months with 5725 person-years, cumulative incidences of mortality, CVD, Stage 4/5 CKD, ESKD and SH were 0, 0.036, 0.050, 0.017 and 0.020, respectively. The surgery group had a significant reduction in risk of CVD events (HR = 0.464, P = 0.015) and no occurrence of mortality events. However, there were no significant differences in risks of SH [HR = 0.469, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.204-1.081], Stage 4/5 CKD (HR =0.896, 95% CI: 0.519-1.545) and ESKD (HR = 0.666, 95% CI: 0.264-1.683) between two groups, although IRs were lower in the surgery group. Surgical patients had significantly higher eGFR within 12 months and had significantly lower UACR until 48 months. CONCLUSIONS: Among obese T2DM patients, bariatric surgery lowered the risk of CVD and mortality, and was beneficial towards the kidney outcomes.","Wong, Carlos K H; Wu, Tingting; Wong, Simon K H; Law, Betty T T; Grieve, Eleanor; Ng, Enders K W; Wu, Olivia; Lam, Cindy L K",Nephrol. dial. transplant,555,10

Several predictive factors of mortality have been identified; however, none has been validated in patients presenting with mild disease. METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of interstitial pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2, presenting with mild symptoms, and requiring hospitalization in a non-intensive care unit with known discharge status were prospectively collected and retrospectively analysed. Demographical, clinical and biochemical parameters were recorded, as need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation and admission in intensive care unit. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of death. RESULTS: Between 28 February and 10 April 2020, 229 consecutive patients were included in the study cohort; the majority were males with a mean age of 60 years. 54% of patients had at least one comorbidity, with hypertension being the most commonly represented, followed by diabetes mellitus. 196 patients were discharged after a mean of 9 days, while 14.4% died during hospitalization because of respiratory failure. Age higher than 75 years, low platelet count (<150 × 103 /mm3 ) and higher ferritin levels (>750 ng/mL) were independent predictors of death. Comorbidities were not independently associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 presenting with mild symptoms is high and is associated with older age, platelet count and ferritin levels. Identifying early predictors of outcome can be useful in the clinical practice to better stratify and manage patients with COVID-19.","Masetti, Chiara; Generali, Elena; Colapietro, Francesca; Voza, Antonio; Cecconi, Maurizio; Messina, Antonio; Omodei, Paolo; Angelini, Claudio; Ciccarelli, Michele; Badalamenti, Salvatore; Canonica, G Walter; Lleo, Ana; Aghemo, Alessio",Eur J Clin Invest,555,1

Phytophthora sojae is the causative agent for Phytophthora root and stem rot in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and can be managed by deployment of resistance to P. sojae (Rps) genes. PI 340,029 is a soybean landrace carrying broad-spectrum resistance to the pathogen. Analysis of an F2 population derived from a cross between PI 340,029 and a susceptible cultivar 'Williams' reveals that the resistance to P. sojae race 1 is conferred by a single gene, designated Rps14, which was initially mapped to a 4.5-cM region on the short arm of chromosome 3 by bulked segregant analysis (BSA), and subsequently narrowed to a 1.48 cM region corresponding to 229-kb in the Williams 82 reference genome (Wm82 v2.a1), using F3:4 families derived from the F2 population. Further analysis indicates that the broad-spectrum resistance carried by PI 340,029 is fully attributable to Rps14. The genomic sequences corresponding to the defined Rps14 region from a set of diverse soybean varieties exhibit drastic NBS-LRR gene copy number variation, ranging from 3 to 17 copies. Ultimate isolation of Rps14 would be critical for precise selection and deployment of the gene for soybean protection.","Chen, Liyang; Wang, Weidong; Ping, Jieqing; Fitzgerald, Joshua C; Cai, Guohong; Clark, Chancelor B; Aggarwal, Rajat; Ma, Jianxin",Theor. appl. genet,555,1

The aim of the present review was to gather evidence from relevant articles published in English from January to August 2020 in Medline and Google Scholar. The review revealed that pregnant women who become COVID-19-positive are usually either asymptomatic or mild-to-moderately symptomatic, similar to non-pregnant women. Pneumonia is one of the most common outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19. However, it cannot be conclusively said that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the risk of maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications. Pregnant women with COVID-19 with co-morbidities have increased risks of complications: there are regional variations in the rates of adverse outcomes reported. Though uncommon, the review shows that vertical transmission is possible. Additionally, the third trimester seems to be the most vulnerable period of infection. This aspect needs to be researched further to activate surveillance programs at the end of second trimester. Overall, it is necessary to monitor pregnant women before and after delivery, and their infants, during this pandemic.","Salem, Deemah; Katranji, Fawzi; Bakdash, Talah",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,555,21

METHODS: We sent questionnaires to members of JSOG via official email. Participants answered anonymously using Google forms. RESULTS: Two (0.08%) JSOG members had contracted COVID-19. There was a clear decrease in the number of patients scheduled for operation, not only for malignant but also for benign diseases. A decrease in the number of outpatients for infertility treatment was also observed. Polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was available in 20.4% of the facilities. Inpatients and outpatients were requested to wear masks, limit the number of contacts and check body temperature when visiting hospitals/clinics. During parturition care, caregivers and physicians wore gloves, masks (other than N-95), face shields and gowns.

Here we estimate the relation of the online attention on COVID-19-related conspiracy theories to human mobility, as well as to the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases, during 14 March 2020 to 28 August 2020. We observe that the online attention to COVID-19 conspiracy theories is significantly and negatively related to human mobility, but its negative impact is noticeably less than those of the attention to official information and personal protection measures. Since human mobility significantly promotes the spread of COVID-19, the attention to official information and personal protection measures lowers COVID-19 cases by 16.16% and 9.41%, respectively, while attention to conspiracy theories only reduces the COVID-19 cases by 6.65%. In addition, we find that in the states with higher online attention to COVID-19 conspiracy theories, the negative relation of the attention to conspiracy theories is much weaker than that in states where there is less concern about conspiracies.

Methods The clinical data of 13 patients who died of COVID-19 in Central Theater General Hospital, China, between January 4, 2020, and February 24, 2020, were analyzed retrospectively. The data reviewed included clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, radiographic features and dinical treatment plan. The cellular immune function, the expression of inflammatory factors, and lactate level in deceased patients at different stages of the disease were analyzed. Results Of those who died, the patients consisted of 10 men and 3 women. The age of those who died was (74±19) years, and 10(76.9%) patients were over 70 years old. For the patients who died, 9 presented with underlying diseases, 6(46.2%) of whom had more than 2 diseases. On admission, the chest computed tomography (CT) for 8 patients (61.5%) mainly showed multiple patchy ground-glass opacities. When the disease progressed, the ground-glass opacities rapidly developed into diffuse lesions in both lungs. The lymphocyte and CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocyte counts in the peripheral blood of 13 patients were significantly lower than normal levels and decreased more substantially during the disease course based on the levels when admitted (P&lt;0.01). Additionally, the interleukin (IL)-6, D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactic acid levels gradually increased, and most peaked before death. The cause of death for most patients was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with type I respiratory failure. Three patients eventually developed multiorgan deficiency syndrome (MODS). Conclusions The risk factors of death for COVID-19 patients included older men, more underlying diseases, poor cellular immune function and over-expression of inflammatory factors. The main cause of death in patients with COVID-19 was ARDS, which led to respiratory failure and MODS.","Hai-Chao, Liu; Long, Li; Cong-Zheng, Mao; Rui-Juan, Xu; Fang-Qi, Zhang; Zhen-Hong, Hu; Qing, Song",Med.

The impacts on allergy/immunology (A/I) care delivery are still being studied. OBJECTIVE: To describe the outcomes of rapid transition to TM-based care (video visit followed by in-person visits dedicated to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures when needed) at an academic A/I practice during COVID-19. METHODS: Demographic data were compared for patients originally scheduled for in-person visits between March 10, 2020, and April 30, 2020, who completed a video visit instead between March 10, 2020, and June 30, 2020, and those who did not. Appointment completion, diagnoses, and drug allergy and skin testing completion were compared for visits between March 10, 2020, and June 30, 2020, and 1 year prior (March 10, 2019-June 30, 2019). RESULTS: Sixty-nine percent (265 of 382) of patients originally scheduled between March 10, 2020, and April 30, 2020, were able to complete video visits. Patients who completed video visits were more likely to be white (52% vs 33%; P < .001), English-speaking (96% vs 89%; P = .01), and privately insured (70% vs 54%; P = .004). With TM-based care compared with in-person care, there were significant decreases in environmental and food skin testing completion rates (91% and 92% in 2019 vs 60% and 64% in 2020, respectively, P < .001). Drug allergy testing completed after internal referral remained low but comparable (51% in 2019 vs 52% in 2020). Transitioning nonprocedural visits to video allowed allergen immunotherapy and biologic injection visits to resume at a volume similar to pre-COVID. No COVID-19 infections resulted from in-clinic exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Although transitioning to TM-based care allowed continued A/I care delivery, strategies are needed to achieve higher testing completion rates and ensure video visits do not exacerbate existing health disparities.","Tsao, Lulu R; Villanueva, Stephanie Anne; Pines, David A; Pham, Michele N; Choo, Eugene M; Tang, Monica C; Otani, Iris M",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,555,21

There are two types of clinical appearances in spindle cell hemangiomatosis in the distal extremities: bleb-like nodules and varix-like nodules. Bleb-like nodules are mostly superficially located in the palm or interphalangeal joints with obvious hemorrhage in lesions and mainly composed of cavernous spaces rather than spindle cells. Varix-like nodules are located in the back of the hands or arms with normal skin color and mainly composed of solid areas of accumulated spindle cells. Surgery is the standard therapy for spindle cell hemangiomatosis, while sclerotherapy is invalid.

Based on these questions, we propose a roadmap to facilitate the development of reliable models to guide exit strategies. This roadmap requires a global collaborative effort from the scientific community and policymakers, and has three parts: (i) improve estimation of key epidemiological parameters; (ii) understand sources of heterogeneity in populations; and (iii) focus on requirements for data collection, particularly in low-to-middle-income countries. This will provide important information for planning exit strategies that balance socio-economic benefits with public health.","Thompson, Robin N; Hollingsworth, T Déirdre; Isham, Valerie; Arribas-Bel, Daniel; Ashby, Ben; Britton, Tom; Challenor, Peter; Chappell, Lauren H K; Clapham, Hannah; Cunniffe, Nik J; Dawid, A Philip; Donnelly, Christl A; Eggo, Rosalind M; Funk, Sebastian; Gilbert, Nigel; Glendinning, Paul; Gog, Julia R; Hart, William S; Heesterbeek, Hans; House, Thomas; Keeling, Matt; Kiss, István Z; Kretzschmar, Mirjam E; Lloyd, Alun L; McBryde, Emma S; McCaw, James M; McKinley, Trevelyan J; Miller, Joel C; Morris, Martina; O039,; Neill, Philip D; Parag, Kris V; Pearson, Carl A B; Pellis, Lorenzo; Pulliam, Juliet R C; Ross, Joshua V; Tomba, Gianpaolo Scalia; Silverman, Bernard W; Struchiner, Claudio J; Tildesley, Michael J; Trapman, Pieter; Webb, Cerian R; Mollison, Denis; Restif, Olivier",Proc Biol Sci,555,16

During emergency mode teaching in the summer semester of 2020, a pilot project on practical classroom teaching under COVID-19 conditions was undertaken the Skills Lab Dresden, the Interprofessional Medical Training Centre (MITZ). Students were able to continue learning basic communication and manual skills. This project report presents the adaptations needed for this teaching concept and discusses their feasibility as well as selected evaluation results of the trial run. Description of the project: In normal teaching, students rotate to complete training sessions in small groups. Teaching is provided in a peer-teaching format. An Inverted Classroom Model was implemented as a teaching concept during emergency operation with preparation through digital learning and classroom teaching. Organisational and teaching adjustments were carried out for the concept and to comply with containment regulations. The concept was evaluated by the students using a standardised online questionnaire. Results: 1012 students completed their training during emergency operation at the university. The containment regulations meant that there were a higher number of training sessions and a higher workload. Only one of the alternative dates provided had to be used for COVID-19-related reasons. Infection chains could be tracked. The majority of students found the communication of information via Moodle to be sufficient and did not experience any technical problems. An analysis of the students' evaluation revealed a high level of overall satisfaction with the adapted teaching concept. Conclusion: The MITZ will once again use the concept in a modified form should there be renewed or continued emergency operation. The Inverted Classroom Model will also be established as an integral part of regular teaching. The findings may be of interest to other Skills Labs to develop concepts for emergency operation teaching to efficiently utilise site-specific resources.","Röhle, Anne; Horneff, Henrike; Willemer, Marie-Christin",GMS J Med Educ,555,20

Children, although important drivers of silent transmission, are not included in the current COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. Objective: To estimate the benefits of identifying silent infections among children as a proxy for their vaccination. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used an age-structured disease transmission model, parameterized with census data and estimates from published literature, to simulate the estimated synergistic effect of interventions in reducing attack rates during the course of 1 year among a synthetic population representative of the US demographic composition. The population included 6 age groups of 0 to 4, 5 to 10, 11 to 18, 19 to 49, 50 to 64, and 65 years or older based on US census data. Data were analyzed from December 12, 2020, to February 26, 2021. Exposures: In addition to the isolation of symptomatic cases within 24 hours of symptom onset, vaccination of adults was implemented to reach a 40% to 60% coverage during 1 year with an efficacy of 95% against symptomatic and severe COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: The combinations of proportion and speed for detecting silent infections among children that would suppress future attack rates to less than 5%. Results: In the base-case scenarios with an effective reproduction number Re = 1.2, a targeted approach that identifies 11% of silent infections among children within 2 days and 14% within 3 days after infection would bring attack rates to less than 5% with 40% vaccination coverage of adults. If silent infections among children remained undetected, achieving the same attack rates would require an unrealistically high vaccination coverage (&#8805;81%) of this age group, in addition to 40% vaccination coverage of adults. The estimated effect of identifying silent infections was robust in sensitivity analyses with respect to vaccine efficacy against infection and reduced susceptibility of children to infection. Conclusions and Relevance: In this simulation modeling study of a synthetic US population, in the absence of vaccine availability for children, a targeted approach to rapidly identify silent COVID-19 infections in this age group was estimated to significantly mitigate disease burden. These findings suggest that without measures to interrupt transmission chains from silent infections, vaccination of adults is unlikely to contain the outbreaks in the near term.","Moghadas, Seyed M; Fitzpatrick, Meagan C; Shoukat, Affan; Zhang, Kevin; Galvani, Alison P",JAMA Netw Open,555,6

Little is known, however, about provider practices for identifying patients who experience financial hardship and the strategies for mitigating hardship and addressing patient needs. In this editorial, we discuss a study of practices within the NCI Community Oncology Research Program. McLouth and colleagues found disparities in the use of screening and financial navigation and reliance on inadequate screening methods. To address these disparities, we emphasize the importance of comprehensive and ongoing financial hardship screening throughout the course of cancer treatment and survivorship care, as well as the necessity of accompanying counseling, navigation, and referrals. We also recommend key attributes of screening tools and a process for systematic implementation within clinical practice. With adverse health and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affecting people who are racial or ethnic minorities, uninsured or underinsured, or living in poverty, the need to address medical financial hardship is more urgent than ever, to ensure that all people have an equal opportunity for high quality cancer treatment and survival.See related article by McLouth et al., p. 669.","Yabroff, K Robin; Bradley, Cathy J; Shih, Ya-Chen Tina",Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,555,16

Objective: To evaluate rates of antispike (anti-S) antibody response to a BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with cancer who are undergoing systemic treatment vs healthy controls. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study included 102 adult patients with solid tumors undergoing active intravenous anticancer treatment and 78 controls who received the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine at least 12 days before enrollment. The controls were taken from a convenience sample of the patients' family/caregivers who accompanied them to treatment. The study was conducted between February 22, 2021, and March 15, 2021 at Davidoff Cancer Center at Beilinson Hospital (Petah Tikva, Israel). Interventions: Blood samples were drawn from the study participants. Serum samples were analyzed and the titers of the IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain were determined using a commercially available immunoassay. Seropositivity was defined as 50 or greater AU/mL. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the rate of seropositivity. Secondary outcomes included comparisons of IgG titers and identifying factors that were associated with seropositivity using univariate/multivariable analyses. Results: The analysis included 180 participants, which comprised 102 patients with cancer (median [interquartile range (IQR)] age, 66 [56-72] years; 58 men [57%]) and 78 healthy controls (median [IQR] age, 62 [49-70] years; 25 men [32%]). The most common tumor type was gastrointestinal (29 [28%]). In the patient group, 92 (90%) were seropositive for SARS-CoV 2 antispike IgG antibodies after the second vaccine dose, whereas in the control group, all were seropositive. The median IgG titer in the patients with cancer was significantly lower than that in the controls (1931 [IQR, 509-4386] AU/mL vs 7160 [IQR, 3129-11â¯241] AU/mL; P < .001). In a multivariable analysis, the only variable that was significantly associated with lower IgG titers was treatment with chemotherapy plus immunotherapy (ß, -3.5; 95% CI, -5.6 to -1.5). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of patients with cancer who were receiving active systemic therapy, 90% of patients exhibited adequate antibody response to the BNT162b2 vaccine, although their antibody titers were significantly lower than those of healthy controls. Further research into the clinical relevance of lower titers and their durability is required.

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search using the databases: PubMed, Embase, and EuropePMC. Data on visceral fat area (VTA), subcutaneous fat area (SFA), and total fat area (TFA) were collected. The outcome of interest was severe COVID-19. We used a REML random-effects model to pool the mean differences and odds ratio (OR). RESULTS: There were 5 studies comprising of 539 patients. Patients with severe COVID-19 have a higher VTA (mean difference 41.7 cm2 [27.0, 56.4], p < 0.001; I2: 0%) and TFA (mean difference 64.6 cm2 [26.2, 103.1], p = 0.001; I2: 0%).

This study aimed to identify and follow potentially infected healthcare workers in one hospital in order to develop an epidemiological baseline for COVID-19 infection and spread rates in this population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted between 1 April and 30 June 2020 at a single Belgian hospital. Healthcare workers with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 were included. Participants underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and analysis of blood samples for antibody response at different timepoints (day 0, 7, 14 and day 30 or 60). Patient exposures, symptoms, and disease progression were collected. RESULTS: Of a total of 150 healthcare workers with symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 31% (47) tested positive for the virus by NP swab. Of the 47 participants with positive NP swabs, 66% also had positive IgG serology. Of the 99 participants with negative NP swabs who underwent blood sample collection, 5% had positive IgG serology results. Of the 29 participants who presented with at least 3 major symptoms, 15 (52%) had positive NP swabs and 14 (48%) had positive serology. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that evidence of symptoms, even when major, is a poor predictor for SARS-CoV-2 positivity in health care workers and raises the question of the best way to efficiently screen this population especially during the upcoming flu period.","Datlibagi, Azine; Tran, Ngoc Anh Phuong; Dugauquier, Artemise; Hoornaert, Mathilde; Mabchour, Ayman; Mayamba, Anthony-Rostane; Fayad, Georges; Wautier, Magali; Van Den Wijngaert, Sigi; Debaisieux, Laurent; De Wilde, Virginie",Acta Clin Belg,555,16

Both SARS CoV-1 and 2 are suspected to spread through outdoor routes in high-density cities, infecting residents in apartments on separate floors or in different buildings in many superspreading events, often in the absence of close personal contact. The viability of such mode of transmission is disputed in the research literature, and there is little evidence on the dose–response relationship at the apartment level. This paper describes a study to examine the viability of outdoor airborne transmission between neighboring apartments in high density cities. A first-principles model, airborne transmission via outdoor route (ATOR), was developed to simulate airborne pathogen generation, natural decay, outdoor dispersion, apartment entry, and inhalation exposure of susceptible persons in neighboring apartments. The model was partially evaluated using a smoke tracer experiment in a mock-up high-density city site and cross-checking using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. The ATOR model was used to retrospectively investigate the relationship between viral exposure and disease infection at an apartment level in two superspreading events in Hong Kong: the SARS outbreak in Amoy Gardens and the COVID-19 outbreak in Luk Chuen House. Logistic regression results suggested that the predicted viral exposure was positively correlated with the probability of disease infection at apartment level for both events. Infection risks associated with the outdoor route transmission of SARS can be reduced to &lt;10%, if the quanta emission rate from the primary patient is below 30 q/h. Compared with the indoor route transmission, the outdoor route can better explain patterns of disease infection. A viral plume can spread upward and downward, driven by buoyancy forces, while also dispersing under natural wind. Fan-assistant natural ventilation in residential buildings may increase infection risks. Findings have implication for public health response to current and future pandemics and the ATOR model can serve as planning and design tool to identify the risk of airborne disease transmission in high-density cities. © Copyright © 2021 Huang, Jones, Zhang, Hou, Hang and Spengler.","Huang, J.; Jones, P.; Zhang, A.; Hou, S.

Investigating the prevalence of the symptoms of these disorders during the quarantine due to the coronavirus 2019 pandemic (COVID-19) is important to outline clinical strategies for patient care. Objective: This study assessed the prevalence of TMD symptoms, anxiety, depression, and oral behaviors and their associations during the social isolation due to COVID-19. Methodology: Questionnaires were used to assess TMD symptoms in accordance with the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders: clinical protocol and assessment instruments, a questionnaire to verify oral behaviors and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to assess symptoms of anxiety and depression in students of dentistry at the Faculty of Health Sciences of the University of Brasília in May 2020. Qualitative data were subjected to descriptive statistics and chi-squared analysis (p&lt;0.05). The relationship between quantitative and qualitative data was evaluated using Spearman's rho correlation (p&lt;0.05). Results: There was a high prevalence of TMD symptoms, anxiety, and depression in the participants, resulting in association between gender and anxiety symptoms (p=0.029). There was a positive correlation between oral behaviors and TMD symptoms (r=0.364; p&lt;0.001), between oral behaviors and anxiety symptoms (r=0.312; p=0.001), and between oral behaviors and symptoms of depression (r=0.216; p=0.021).

From a given set of items, the learner can make pairwise comparisons on every pair of items, and each comparison returns an independent noisy result about the preferred item. At any time, the learner can adaptively choose a pair of items to compare according to past observations (i.e., active learning). The learner's goal is to find the (approximately) best-$k$ items with a given confidence, while trying to use as few comparisons as possible. In this paper, we study two problems: (i) finding the probably approximately correct (PAC) best-$k$ items and (ii) finding the exact best-$k$ items, both under strong stochastic transitivity and stochastic triangle inequality. For PAC best-$k$ items selection, we first show a lower bound and then propose an algorithm whose sample complexity upper bound matches the lower bound up to a constant factor. For the exact best-$k$ items selection, we first prove a worst-instance lower bound. We then propose two algorithms based on our PAC best items selection algorithms: one works for $k=1$ and is sample complexity optimal up to a loglog factor, and the other works for all values of $k$ and is sample complexity optimal up to a log factor.","Ren, Wenbo; Liu, Jia; Shroff, Ness B.",,555,12

The link between environment and immunity is particularly intriguing as it is known that chemicals and drugs can cause immunotoxicity (e.g., allergies and autoimmune diseases). In this review, we emphasize the relationship between long-term exposure to xenobiotic mixtures and immune deficiency inherent to chronic diseases and epidemics/pandemics. We also address the immunotoxicologic risk of vulnerable groups, taking into account biochemical and biophysical properties of SARS-CoV-2 and its immunopathological implications. We particularly underline the common mechanisms by which xenobiotics and SARS-CoV-2 act at the cellular and molecular level. We discuss how long-term exposure to thousand chemicals in mixtures, mostly fossil fuel derivatives, exposure toparticle matters, metals, ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation, ionizing radiation and lifestyle contribute to immunodeficiency observed in the contemporary pandemic, such as COVID-19, and thus threaten global public health, human prosperity and achievements, and global economy.

However, traditional organic liquid electrolytes bestow SIBs/KIBs with serious safety concerns. In contrast, quasi-/solid-phase electrolytes including polymer electrolytes (PEs) and inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) show great superiority of high safety. However, the poor processibility and relatively low ionic conductivity of Na+ and K+ ions limit the further practical applications of ISEs. PEs combine some merits of both liquid-phase electrolytes and ISEs, and present great potentials in next-generation energy storage systems. Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving their overall properties. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of an in-depth and comprehensive review to get insights into mechanisms and corresponding design strategies of PEs. Herein, the advantages of different electrolytes, particularly PEs are first minutely reviewed, and the mechanism of PEs for Na+ /K+ ion transfer is summarized. Then, representative researches and recent progresses of SIBs/KIBs based on PEs are presented.

However, data on whether asthma constitutes a risk factor for COVID-19 and the prevalence of asthma in COVID-19 cases still remain scant. Here, we interrogated and analyzed the association between COVID-19 and asthma. METHODS: In this study, we systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for studies published between January 1 and August 28, 2020. We included studies that reported the epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 and its prevalence in asthma patients. We excluded reviews, animal trials, single case reports, small case series and studies evaluating other coronavirus-related illnesses. Raw data from the studies were pooled into a meta-analysis. RESULTS: We analyzed findings from 18 studies, including asthma patients with COVID-19. The pooled prevalence of asthma in COVID-19 cases was 0.08 (95% CI, 0.06-0.11), with an overall I2 of 99.07%, p < 0.005. The data indicated that asthma did not increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 1.04 (95% CI, 0.75-1.46) p = 0.28; I2=20%). In addition, there was no significant difference in the incidence of asthma with age in COVID-19 infections [OR] 0.77(95% CI, 0.59-1.00) p = 0.24; I2=29%). CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data suggested that asthma is not a significant risk factor for the development of severe COVID-19.","Wu, Ting; Yu, Pengyi; Li, Yuanxia; Wang, Junxin; Li, Zhen; Qiu, Jingjing; Cui, Limei; Mou, Yakui; Sun, Yan",J Asthma,555,20

Especially music students needed to adapt their musical learning to this particular situation. Mostly affected by the lockdown was the musical practicing behavior, especially when practicing at the University of Music was not possible. In this study, music students in their second and third semesters were asked to provide information on their practicing situations during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown. They were required to fill in questionnaires about the practicing time and concepts of self-efficacy and self-regulation for musical learning. The data of 18 music students were collected. For the analysis, they were compared with the answers of 15 music students who were asked the same questions half a year earlier before the pandemic situation occurred. The results showed that the music students relocated mostly to their parents' homes for practicing during the lockdown. In the amount of practicing, the bachelor of music students practiced less during lockdown compared with before the lockdown. The mean self-efficacy for musical learning did not differ between before and during the lockdown. For the self-regulated musical learning, the music students showed significantly higher values in the subscale on reflecting and creating a framework for the progress of musical learning during the lockdown. The findings indicate that the music students developed certain self-regulated learning skills during the lockdown and managed to find suitable solutions in continuing with their musical learning without reservation.","Nusseck, M.; Spahn, C.",Frontiers in Psychology,555,16

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study within the Lymphomes Oculo-Cérébraux national network (LOC) to assess the clinical characteristics and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in PCNSL patients (positive real-time polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swab or evocative lung computed tomography scan). We compared clinical characteristics between patients with severe (death and/or intensive care unit admission) and mild disease. RESULTS: Between March and May 2020, 13 PCNSL patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 11 (85%) of whom were undergoing chemotherapy at the time of infection. The mortality rate was 23% (3/13), and two additional patients (15%) required mechanical ventilation. Two patients (15%) had no COVID-19 symptoms. History of diabetes mellitus was more common in severe patients (3/5 vs 0/8, p = 0.03). Two patients recovered from COVID-19 after mechanical ventilation during more than two weeks and resumed chemotherapy. In all, chemotherapy was resumed after COVID-19 recovery in nine patients (69%) after a median delay of 16 days (range 3-32), none of whom developed unusual chemotherapy complication nor SARS-Cov2 reactivation. CONCLUSION: This preliminary analysis suggests that, while being at higher risk be for severe illness, PCNSL patients with COVID-19 might be treated maximally especially if they achieved oncological response at the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chemotherapy might be resumed without prolonged delay in PCNSL patients with COVID-19.","Laurenge, Alice; Ursu, Renata; Houillier, Caroline; Abdi, Basma; Tebano, Gianpiero; Quemeneur, Cyril; Choquet, Sylvain; Di Blasi, Roberta; Lozano, Fernando; Morales, Andrea; Durán-Peña, Alberto; Sirven-Villaros, Lila; Mathon, Bertrand; Mokhtari, Karima; Bielle, Franck; Martin-Duverneuil, Nadine; Delattre, Jean-Yves; Marcelin, Anne-Geneviève; Pourcher, Valérie; Alentorn, Agusti; Idbaih, Ahmed; Carpentier, Antoine F; Leblond, Véronique; Hoang-Xuan, Khê; Touat, Mehdi",J. neurol,555,30

T cells are important for antiviral defense, but it is not known whether patients with cancer treated with ICI are more or less vulnerable to viral infections such as COVID-19. Furthermore, immunosuppressive treatment of immune-related adverse events (irAE) may also impact infection risk. Rheumatic irAEs are often persistent, and can require long-term treatment with immunosuppressive agents. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of COVID-19 infection and assess changes in ICI and immunosuppressive medication use among patients enrolled in a prospective rheumatic irAE registry during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 16 2020, following the 'surge' of COVID-19 infections in the New York Tri-State area, we sent a 23-question survey to 88 living patients enrolled in a single institutional registry of patients with rheumatic irAE. Questions addressed current cancer and rheumatic irAE status, ICI and immunosuppressant medication use, history of COVID-19 symptoms and/or diagnosed infection. A follow-up survey was sent out 6 weeks later. Sixty-five (74%) patients completed the survey. Mean age was 63 years, 59% were female, 70% had received anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy and 80% had had an irAE affecting their joints. Six patients (10%) had definite or probable COVID-19, but all recovered uneventfully, including two still on ICI and on low-to-moderate dose prednisone. Of the 25 on ICI within the last 6 months, seven (28%) had their ICI held due to the pandemic. In patients on immunosuppression for irAE, none had changes made to those medications as a result of the pandemic. The incidence of COVID-19 was no higher in patients still on ICI. Ten percent of rheumatic irAE patients developed COVID-19 during the NY Tri-state 'surge' of March-April 2020. Oncologists held ICI in a quarter of the patients still on them, particularly women, those on anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapy, and those who had had a good cancer response. The incidence of COVID-19 was no higher on patients still on ICI.

Secondary aims were to assess perceived restrictions, influence on mental health, and functional outcome compared to patients undergoing surgery without restriction. METHODS: During February and March 2020, 105 patients underwent THA (n = 48) or TKA (n = 57) and completed preoperative and six-month postoperative assessments. A cohort of 415 patients undergoing surgery in 2019 were used as the control. Patient demographic data, BMI, comorbidities, Oxford Hip Score (OHS) or Knee Score (OKS), and EuroQoL five-domain (EQ-5D) score were collected preoperatively and at six months postoperatively. At six months postoperatively, the 2020 patients were also asked to complete a questionnaire relating to the effect of the social restrictions on their outcome and their mental health. RESULTS: Nearly half of the patients (47.6%, n = 50/105) felt that the restrictions imposed by COVID-19 had limited their rehabilitation and were associated with a significantly worse postoperative OKS (p &lt; 0.001), EQ-5D score (p &lt; 0.001), and lower satisfaction rate (p = 0.019). The reasons for the perceived limited rehabilitation were: being unable to exercise (n = 32, 64%), limited access to physiotherapy (n = 30, 60%), and no face-to-face follow-up (n = 30, 60%). A quarter (n = 26) felt that their mental health had deteriorated postoperatively;17.1% (n = 18) felt depressed and 26.7% (n = 28) felt anxious. Joint-specific scores and satisfaction for the 2020 group were no different to the 2019 group, however patients undergoing THA in 2020 had a significantly worse postoperative EQ-5D compared to the 2019 cohort (difference 0.106;p = 0.001) which was not observed in patients undergoing TKA. CONCLUSION: Half of the 2020 cohort felt that their rehabilitation had been limited and was associated with worse postoperative Oxford and EQ-5D scores, and lower rates of patient satisfaction, but relative to the 2019 cohort their overall outcomes were no different, with the exception of THA patients who had a worse general health score.

METHODS: A web-based expert panel discussion on April 18, 2020, where eight experts were invited to share their experience with COVID-19 disease touching several aspects of aortic medicine. After each talk, specific questions were asked by the online audience, and results were immediately evaluated and shared with faculty and participants. RESULTS: As of April 18, 73.3% answered that more than 200 patients have been treated at their respective settings. Sixty-four percent were reported that their hospital was well prepared for the pandemic. In 57.7%, the percentage of infected healthcare professionals was below 5% whereas 19.2% reported the percentage to be between 10% and 20%. Sixty-seven percent reported the application of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in less than 2% of COVID-19 patients whereas 11.8% reported application in 5%-10% of COVID-19 patients. Thirty percent of participants reported the occurrence of pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 patients. Three percent reported to have seen aortic ruptures in primarily elective patients having been postponed because of the anticipated need to provide sufficient ICU capacity because of the pandemic. Nearly 70% reported a decrease in acute aortic syndrome referrals since the start of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The current COVID-19 pandemic has-besides the stoppage of elective referrals-also led to a decrease of referrals of acute aortic syndromes in many settings. The reluctance of patients seeking medical help seems to be a major driver. The number of patients, who have been postponed due to the provisioning of ICU resources but having experienced aortic rupture in the waiting period, is still low. Further, studies are needed to learn more about the influence that the COVID-19 pandemic has on the treatment of patients with acute and chronic aortic disease.","Czerny, Martin; van den Berg, Jos; Chiesa, Roberto; Jacobs, Michael; Jakob, Stephan; Jenni, Hans-Jörg; Lorusso, Roberto; Pacini, Davide; Quintana, Eduardo; Rylski, Bartosz; Staier, Klaus; Tsilimparis, Nikolaos; Wyss, Thomas; Gottardi, Roman; Schmidli, Juerg",J. card. surg,555,24

The populations most affected are the elderly and especially those with underlying comorbidities. In terms of race and ethnicity, black and hispanic populations are affected at disproportionately higher rates. Individuals with underlying conditions that cause an immune-compromised state are considered vulnerable to this infection. The immune response is an important determinant in viral infections including coronaviruses, not only in the antiviral defense but also in the disease progression, severity, and clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease which also disproportionately afflicts black and hispanic populations. In lupus patients, an aberrant immune response is characterized by the presence of circulating autoantibodies, lymphopenia, aberrant T cells, and proinflammatory cytokines along with defective regulatory mechanisms, leading to immune-mediated damage to tissues. Lupus patients are often treated with immune-suppressants and therefore are immune-compromised and more susceptible to infections and may be vulnerable to coronavirus infection. While the anti-viral immune response is important to protect from coronavirus infection, an uncontrolled proinflammatory cytokine response can lead to cytokine storm which causes damage to the lungs and other organs, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Better understanding of the underlying immune response and therapeutic strategies in lupus and COVID-19 is important to guide management of this deadly infectious disease in the context of lupus and vice-versa.","Spihlman, Allison P; Gadi, Nirupa; Wu, Samantha C; Moulton, Vaishali R",Front Immunol,555,12

Seventy-six psychiatric patients and 109 healthy control subjects were recruited from Chongqing, China and completed a survey on demographic data, physical symptoms during the past 14 days and a range of psychiatric symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS-21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. The mean IES-R, DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress subscale and ISI scores were higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p < 0.001). Serious worries about their physical health, anger and impulsivity and intense suicidal ideation were significantly higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p < 0.05). More than one-third of psychiatric patients might fulfil the diagnostic criteria post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). More than one-quarter of psychiatric patients suffered from moderately severe to severe insomnia. Respondents who reported no change, poor or worse physical health status and had a psychiatric illness were significantly more likely to have higher mean IES-R, DASS depression, anxiety and stress subscale scores and ISI scores (p < 0.05). This study confirms the severity of negative psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 epidemic with strict lockdown measures. Understanding the psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to provide insight into how to develop a new immunopsychiatry service.

However, we do not yet know whether these microorganisms interact. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between Streptococcus pneumoniae and SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric patients. Methods: This study was conducted retrospectively by means of medical records of pediatric patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 11 and June 04, 2020, in the University of Health Sciences, Ankara Educating and Training Hospital and Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine. Results: We evaluated 829 pediatric patients for S. pneumoniae and SARS-CoV-2 from their nasopharyngeal specimen. Of 115 children positive for SARS-CoV-2, 32.2% had a positive S. pneumoniae test, whereas of 714 children negative for SARS-CoV-2, 14.1% had a positive S. pneumoniae test (p < .01). We compared patients with positive vs. negative SARS-CoV-2 tests according to S. pneumoniae positivity There were no statistically significant differences in terms of gender, underlying disease, fever, cough, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, increased CRP, increased procalcitonin, findings of chest x-ray, severity of disease, and treatment. Conclusion: The nasopharyngeal S. pneumoniae carriage rate in patients with COVID-19 was higher than in non-infected children, while S. pneumoniae carriage did not affect the course of COVID-19 disease.

Although the numbers of cases are increasing, no report about clinical manifestations, laboratory results, and imaging findings of the children infected with COVID-19 in Iran has been published. The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, and radiological and laboratory findings of 24 children who had proven SARS-CoV-2 infection and performed chest computed tomographic (CT) in Qom, Iran. METHODS: Demographic information and clinical characteristics of the patients including signs and symptoms, chest CT scan manifestation, laboratory findings and clinical outcomes were collected. Diagnosing of the confirmed case was based on positive real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction test for SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: During the first 3 months of the epidemic in Qom, Iran, 24 children with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. The median age of the cases was 6 years [inter-quartile range 3.5-9.5 years]. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (100%), dry cough (62.5%), tachypnea (29%), abdominal pain (21%), and vomiting (21%). Three cases (12.5%) presented with a history of diarrhea in addition to fever and cough. According to the chest CT findings, 2 cases (8%) showed no abnormality. Typical CT findings were found in 6 patients (25%), 2 patients showed indeterminate appearance, and 14 patients (58%) showed atypical findings. Two children with SARS-CoV-2 infection manifested as a hyperinflammatory syndrome with multi-organ involvement similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome. Seventy-one percent of the patients showed severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and the mortality of 12.5% (3 cases) were reported. INTERPRETATION: High frequency of atypical chest CT finding in children should raise concern for pediatricians. Early recognition of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is of crucial importance in controlling of the outbreak and atypical imaging features should be interpreted with caution.","Mamishi, Setareh; Heydari, Hosein; Aziz-Ahari, Alireza; Shokrollahi, Mohammad Reza; Pourakbari, Babak; Mahmoudi, Shima; Movahedi, Zahra",J. microbiol. immunol. infect,555,24

The urns interact in the sense that the probability of drawing a red ball (which represents an infection state) for a given urn, not only depends on the ratio of red balls in that urn but also on the ratio of red balls in the other urns in the network, hence accounting for the effect of spatial contagion. The resulting network-wide contagion process is a discrete-time finite-memory Markov process, whose transition probability matrix is determined. The stochastic properties of the network contagion Markov process are analytically examined, and in the particular case of memory one with homogeneous urns, we characterize the limiting state of infection in each urn. Given the complexity of this stochastic process, and in the same spirit as the well-studied SIS models, we use a mean-field type approximation to obtain a discrete-time dynamical system for the finite memory interacting P\'{o}lya contagion network. Interestingly, this dynamical system is linear in the memory one case, and is nonlinear for the general memory case. Furthermore, noting that the latter case dynamical system admits a linear variant (realized by retaining its leading linear terms), we study the asymptotic behavior of the linear systems for both memory modes and characterize their equilibrium. Finally, we present simulations to assess the quality of the approximation purveyed by the linear and non-linear dynamical systems, which illustrate the key role that memory plays in improving its accuracy.","Singh, Somya; Alajaji, Fady; Gharesifard, Bahman",,555,15

The theoretical model of the study was based on Martin Seligman's positive psychology and PERMA theory and Paul Wong's Existential Positive Psychology 2.0 Theory, which postulates that negative experiences contribute to well-being and personal growth. The static approach was complemented by exploring the mediating role of psychological flexibility (defined as acceptance and action in the current situation) in the relationship between negative emotions and well-being. The data were collected during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic from 277 participants (221 women), aged M = 33.83, SD = 12.77. The results confirmed that negative emotions correlated negatively with various domains of well-being (PERM), except for accomplishment (completing tasks and fulfill daily responsibilities). Moreover, negative emotions were related to the general well-being through psychological flexibility in that higher depression, anxiety, and stress were associated with lower psychological flexibility, which decreased general well-being. Finally, negative emotions were shown to be beneficial, having an adaptive effect that allows individuals to maintain their ability to cope with the situation, reach goals, and fulfill daily duties and responsibilities despite critical, stressful situation (like the COVID-19 pandemic) that limit their psychological flexibility. This observation confirmed the positive potential of negative aspects of life postulated within Existential Positive Psychology.","Wasowicz, G.; Mizak, S.; Krawiec, J.; Bialaszek, W.",Frontiers in Psychology,555,25

Family functioning, coping strategies, and posttraumatic growth of family caregivers of PwD were measured. Data were processed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, regression analysis, and structural equation modelling.Results: Posttraumatic growth was observed in family caregivers of PwD. The caregiver's gender, relationship with the patient, and difficulty balancing financial income and expenditures in the past month, as well as disease severity of PwD, are significant predictors of posttraumatic growth. There were significantly positive correlations among posttraumatic growth, family functioning and positive coping strategies (Pï¼0.01). Positive coping strategies exert a complete mediating effect between family functioning and posttraumatic growth (ß = 0.49, P < 0.05).Conclusions: A model of the posttraumatic growth of family caregivers of PwD can be established, and the relevant mechanisms can be explored.

In summary, Kobophenol A, identified through docking studies, is the first compound that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 binding to cells through blocking S1-RBD to the host ACE2 receptor and thus may serve as a good lead compound against COVID-19.","Gangadevi, Suresh; Badavath, Vishnu Nayak; Thakur, Abhishek; Yin, Na; De Jonghe, Steven; Acevedo, Orlando; Jochmans, Dirk; Leyssen, Pieter; Wang, Ke; Neyts, Johan; Yujie, Tao; Blum, Galia",J Phys Chem Lett,555,27

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: A representative sample of US ED visits using data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS). PARTICIPANTS: Paediatric (age &#8804;18 years) ED visits in the 2017 NHAMCS data set. DATA ANALYSIS: Each visit was coded as pain-related or non-pain-related using the 'reason for visit' variable. Weighted proportions were calculated with 95% CIs. Logistic regression was used to compare odds of pain-related visits. OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of pain-related visits among paediatric ED visits. RESULTS: There were an estimated 35 million paediatric ED visits in the USA in 2017, 55.6% (CI 53.3% to 57.8%) were pain related, which equates to 19.7 million annual visits. The prevalence of pain-related visits reached more than 50% of visits at age 6-7 and plateaued at relatively high proportions. Children of races other than white or black had lower odds of having a pain-related visit (OR 0.48, CI 0.29 to 0.81) than white children, as did children who were black, though the difference was not statistically significant (OR 0.88, CI 0.73 to 1.06). Relative to children covered by private insurance, children with Medicaid or CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) coverage had lower odds of a pain-related visit (OR 0.75, CI 0.60 to 0.93). Injuries represented 46.5% (CI 42.0% to 51.0%) of pain-related visits. Pain scores were reported in less than 50% of pain-related visits. CONCLUSION: Pain is the reason for visit in 55.6% of paediatric ED visits across the USA. The prevalence of pain-related visits peak before adolescence and it continues relatively high until the age 18. Injury, racial disparities in pain and poor pain score reporting should remain major topics of study in the paediatric population.","Anderson, Jana L; Oliveira J E Silva, Lucas; Funni, Shealeigh A; Bellolio, Fernanda; Jeffery, Molly Moore",BMJ Open,555,16

This systematic review aims to stratify studies as high or low risk of bias to determine the true sensitivity of CT for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection according to the unbiased (low risk) studies, a topic of particular importance given the insufficient quantity of RT-PCR kits in many countries. We focus on sensitivity as that is the chief advantage perceived of CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This systematic review involved searching the PubMed and Google Scholar databases for articles conducted and published between January 1 and April 15, 2020. The quality assessment tool QUADAS-2 was used to stratify studies according to their risk of bias, and exclusion criteria included not providing the information deemed relevant for such a stratification, such as not indicating if the patients were symptomatic or asymptomatic, or identifying the source of the specimen for the reference standard, RT-PCR (eg, nasal, oropharyngeal, etc). Sensitivity values were then extracted, and random effects meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 641 search results, 37 studies (n = 9610 patients) were included in the analysis. The mean sensitivity of RT-PCR for COVID-19 reported by the biased studies was 70% (n = 5409/7 studies; 95% confidence interval [CI], 43-97; I = 99.1%), compared with 78% by unbiased studies (n = 534/4 studies; 95% CI, 69-87, I = 89.9%). For chest CT, the mean sensitivity reported by biased studies was 94% (n = 3371 patients/24 studies; 95% CI, 92-96; I = 93.1%), compared with 75% by unbiased studies (n = 957/10 studies; 95% CI, 67-83; I = 89.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The difference between the sensitivities of CT and RT-PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection is lower than previously thought, as after stratifying the studies, the true sensitivity for CT based on the unbiased studies is limited.","Waller, Joseph V; Allen, Isabel E; Lin, Keldon K; Diaz, Michael J; Henry, Travis S; Hope, Michael D",Invest Radiol,555,7

Guidelines following discharge from acute inpatient rehabilitation have not yet been established. This study seeks to establish outcomes of rehabilitation patients with COVID-19 and characterize their need for long-term care. OBJECTIVE: To determine the functional outcomes and utilization of follow-up medical care for patients with COVID-19 90 days following discharge from acute inpatient rehabilitation, as compared to rehabilitation impairment and age-matched controls. DESIGN: Prospective, single-center cohort study. SETTING: Inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF). PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-eight patients were identified to answer survey questions following discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. The cohort consisted of 64 patients recovering from COVID-19 and 64 age and impairment group category controls. A total of 36 patients participated in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Functional outcomes at discharge, hospital readmissions, and follow-up care sought by patients. RESULTS: The COVID-19 patient group had similar improvements in functional outcomes as compared to controls. Patients with COVID-19 required fewer readmissions than their matched controls in the 30-to 90-day periods and required fewer follow-up visits with specialists after discharge from the IRF.

Unblinding bias can for example result from a drug's marked side effects. If such unblinding bias is present for a given drug, then it might be expected that the placebos of that drug are rated significantly less effective than that of other antidepressants. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, the present exploratory analysis conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) comparing the efficacy of 19 different placebos in placebo-controlled trials provided in the dataset by Cipriani et al. (Lancet 2018; 391: 1357-66). Primary outcome was efficacy (continuous) estimated on the standardized mean difference (SMD) scale and defined as the pre-post change on the Hamilton Depression scale (HAMD-17), on which information was available in N = 258 trials. RESULTS: Comparative placebo ranking suggested mirtazapine-placebo (SMD -2.0 [- 5.0-1.0 95% CrI]) to be the most, and amitriptyline- (SMD 1.2 [- 1.6-3.9 95% CrI]) and trazodone- (SMD 2.1 [- 0.9-5.2 95% CrI]) placebos to be the least effective placebos. Other placebos suggested to be more effective than amitriptyline- and trazodone-placebos (based on 95% CrIs excluding zero) were citalopram, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine placebos. These NMA results were corroborated by the observation that the relative efficacy between drug and placebo was considerably larger for amitriptyline and trazodone than for instance mirtazapine, duloxetine, and venlafaxine, supported by a small and insignificant correlation between drug-efficacy and placebo-efficacy (r = - 0.202, p = 0.408). DISCUSSION: The present exploratory NMA indicates that distinguishable side effects of older drugs may unblind outcome-assessors thus resulting in overestimation of the average drug-placebo difference and underrating bias in placebo-arms, particularly for the older antidepressant drugs amitriptyline and trazodone. If confirmed in prospective studies, these findings suggest that efficacy rankings for antidepressants are susceptible to bias and should be considered unreliable or misleading. The analysis is limited by the focus on the single-comparison placebos (76%, i.e., placebos assessed in two-arm trials), since double-comparison placebos (25%, i.e., placebos assessed in three-arm trials) are hard to interpret and therefore not included in the present interpretation. Another limitation is the problem of multiplicity, which was only approximately accounted for in the Bayesian NMA by modelling treatment effects as exchangeable.","Holper, Lisa; Hengartner, Michael P",BMC Psychiatry,555,20

The purpose of this work is to analyse the knowledge structure and trends in scientific research in the Online Information Reviews journal by bibliometric analysis of key words and social network analysis of co-words. Methods. Key words included in a set of 758 papers included in the Web of Science database from 2000 to 2014 were analysed. We conducted a subject analysis considering the key words assigned to papers. A social network analysis was also conducted to identify the number of co-occurrences between key words (co-words). The Pajek software was used to create and graphically visualize the networks. Results. Internet is the most frequent key word (n=219) and the most central in the network of co-words, strongly associated with Information retrieval, search engines, the World Wide Web, libraries and users Conclusions. Information science, as represented by Online Information Review in the present study, is an evolving discipline that draws on literature from a relatively wide range of subjects. Although Online Information Review appears to have well-defined and established research topics, the journal also changes rapidly to embrace new lines of research.","Valderrama-Zurian, Juan-Carlos; Navarro-Molina, Carolina; Aguilar-Moya, Remedios; Melero-Fuentes, David; Aleixandre-Benavent, Rafael",,555,1

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has been increasingly recognized complication in these patients and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, the factors associated with development of DVT in patients with COVID-19 have not been elucidated due to the novelty of the virus. We performed a meta-analysis of published studies comparing laboratory results in COVID-19 patients with and without DVT with the aim of identifying risk factors. We searched major databases for studies evaluating DVT in COVID-positive patients and performed a meta-analysis of baseline laboratory markers associated with development of DVT. A total of six studies with 678 patients were included in the pooled analyses. Of the 678 patients, 205 of patients had a DVT. Patients diagnosed with DVT were more likely to be older [mean difference 4.59 years, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-7.92], and needing admission to ICU (relative risk 1.96, 95% CI 1.09-3.51). Patients with DVT had significantly higher white cell count (mean difference 1.36â×â10/l, 95% CI 0.33-2.40) and D-dimer levels (mean difference 3229.8, 95% CI 1501.5-4958.1). Lymphocyte count was lower in patients with DVT (mean difference -0.19â×â10/l, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.02). Patients with COVID-19 who develop DVT are more likely to be older and have leukocytosis with lymphopenia. Moreover, D-dimer is statistically higher and patients that are admitted to the ICU are at great risk to develop DVT.","Loomba, Rohit S; Aggarwal, Gaurav; Villarreal, Enrique G; Farias, Juan S; Flores, Saul; Lavie, Carl J; Aggarwal, Saurabh",Blood coagul. fibrinolysis,555,20

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted where antibody responses of IgG and IgA towards SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were studied over time in patients with COVID-19. Possible associations between antibody titers and outcome were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty patients with COVID-19, hospitalized at Skåne University hospital, Sweden, between April and June 2020 were included. IgG antibody responses were detected for all patients with the highest levels four weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis. Levels of IgA were generally higher at diagnosis and decreased towards baseline 4 weeks after confirmed COVID-19. Patients with severe COVID-19 had higher levels of antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein compared with patients with mild disease. CONCLUSION: IgG and IgA antibodies towards the spike protein follow different kinetics during COVID-19 and patients with severe disease develop higher antibody levels.","Bläckberg, Anna; Fernström, Nils; Sarbrant, Emma; Rasmussen, Magnus; Sunnerhagen, Torgny",PLoS One,555,16

The diffuse inflammation leads to endothelium dysfunction in pulmonary blood vessels, uncoupling eNOS activity, lowering NO production, causing pulmonary physiological alterations and coagulopathy. On the other hand, iNOS activity is increased, which may be advantageous for host defense, once NO plays antiviral effects. However, overproduction of NO may be deleterious, generating a pro-inflammatory effect. In this review, we discussed the role of endogenous NO as a protective or deleterious agent of the respiratory and vascular systems, the most affected in COVID-19 patients, focusing on eNOS and iNOS roles. We also reviewed the currently available NO therapies and pointed out possible alternative treatments targeting NO metabolism, which could help mitigate health crises in the present and future CoV's spillovers.","Guimarães, Lara M F; Rossini, Caio V T; Lameu, Claudiana",Nitric Oxide,555,30

More than 4 million people globally are infected by the virus and about 300,000 dead cases until this moment. The ventilation and airborne filters are also investigated aiming to develop an efficient antiviral filtration technology. Human secretion of the infected person as nasal or saliva droplets goes as airborne and distributes the virus everywhere around the person. N95 and N98 filters are the must use filters for capturing particles of sizes around 300 nm. The average size of the novel corona virus (COVID-19) is 100 nm and there is no standard or special filter suitable for this virus. The nanoparticle-coated airborne filter is a suitable technique in this regard. While the efficiency of this type of filters still needs to be enhanced, new developed nanofiber filters are proposed. Most recently, the charged nanofiber filters of sizes below 100 nm are developed and provide an efficient viral filtration and inactivation. The efficiency of filter must be kept at accepted level without increasing the pressure drop. The present review outlines the most efficient antiviral nanoparticles including the recent functional nanoparticles. The filtration theory, filtration modeling, filter testing, and different types of filter with special concentration on the charged nanofiber filter were discussed.

Here, we developed a novel localized delivery platform, immuno-bioglue (imuGlue), which is inspired by the intrinsic underwater adhesion properties of marine mussels and can allow the optimal retention of anti-PD-L1 drugs at tumor sites and the on-demand release of drugs in response to the tumor microenvironment. Using a triple-negative breast cancer and melanoma models, we found that imuGlue could significantly enhance anti-tumor efficacy by eliciting a robust T cell-mediated immune response while reducing systemic toxicity by preventing the rapid diffusion of anti-PD-L1 drugs into the systemic circulation and other tissues. It was also demonstrated that imuGlue could be successfully utilized for combination therapy with other immunomodulatory drugs to enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of ICB-based immunotherapy, demonstrating its versatility as a new treatment option for cancer immunotherapy.","Joo, Kye Il; Jeong, Yeonsu; Hwang, Sung-Min; Shin, Mincheol; Lee, Jaeyun; Sharma, Garima; Lee, Haena; Im, Sin-Hyeog; Cha, Hyung Joon",Biomaterials,555,33

His fundamental contribution has become thoroughly embedded in subsequent econometric research, yet it could not fully answer all the deep issues that the author raised. Notably, Haavelmo struggled to formalize the implications for decision making of the fact that models can at most approximate actuality. In the same period, Wald initiated his own seminal development of statistical decision theory. Haavelmo favorably cited Wald, but econometrics subsequently did not embrace statistical decision theory. Instead, it focused on study of identification, estimation, and statistical inference. This paper proposes statistical decision theory as a framework for evaluation of the performance of models in decision making. I particularly consider the common practice of as-if optimization: specification of a model, point estimation of its parameters, and use of the point estimate to make a decision that would be optimal if the estimate were accurate. A central theme is that one should evaluate as-if optimization or any other model-based decision rule by its performance across the state space, not the model space. I use prediction and treatment choice to illustrate. Statistical decision theory is conceptually simple, but application is often challenging. Advancement of computation is the primary task to continue building the foundations sketched by Haavelmo and Wald.","Manski, Charles F.",,555,16

We compared cases in Guangzhou and Wuhan to illustrate potential changes in pathogenicity and epidemiological characteristics as the epidemic has progressed. METHODS: We studied 20 patients admitted to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, China from January 22 to February 12, 2020. Data were extracted from medical records. These cases were compared with the 99 cases, previously published in Lancet, from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from January 1 to January 20, 2020. RESULTS: Guangzhou patients were younger and had better prognosis than Wuhan patients. The Wuhan patients were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (23% vs 5%) and had a higher mortality rate (11% vs 0%). Cases in Guangzhou tended to be more community clustered. Diarrhea and vomiting were more common among Guangzhou patients and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in feces. Fecal SARA-CoV-2 RNA remained positive when nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative in some patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates possible diminishing virulence of the virus in the process of transmission. Yet persistent positive RNA in feces after negative nasopharyngeal swabs suggests a possible prolonged transmission period that challenges current quarantine practices.","Lei, Ziying; Cao, Huijuan; Jie, Yusheng; Huang, Zhanlian; Guo, Xiaoyan; Chen, Junfeng; Peng, Liang; Cao, Hong; Dai, Xiaoling; Liu, Jing; Li, Xuejun; Zhu, Jianyun; Xu, Wenxiong; Chen, Dabiao; Gao, Zhiliang; He, Jian-Rong; Lin, Bing-Liang",Travel Med Infect Dis,555,16

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of both injection botulinum toxin type A (botox) and surgical lip repositioning in the correction of the gummy smile due to hyperactive upper lip according to the resulting smile and the patients' satisfaction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study consisted of 24 patients: 12 received the BTX-A (botulinum toxin type-A) injection and the remaining 12 underwent the surgical procedure (lip repositioning). The patients rated their satisfaction according to their gingival display that was defined as the difference between the lower margin of the upper lip and the superior margin of the right incisor, and patients were followed at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 6 months. Post injection and post-surgery with changes documented by photographs. Both groups answered a questionnaire addressing the overall appearance and they were asked to rate the improvement of their smile according to a 5-point aesthetic scale. RESULTS: The patients rated the effects of BTX-A as highly favorable if we take into consideration that BTX-A had a temporary effect while the surgical procedure (lip repositioning) had a relapse likelihood of more than 80% because the lip reverted back to its original position with almost complete relapse after 6 months and not to mention the risks affiliated with the surgical procedures. CONCLUSION: BTX-A injection exhibits better results than those of surgery and had given safer and more satisfactory results and achieved the required cosmetic patient requirement than lip repositioning.","Makkeiah, M O; Harfoush, M; Makkiah, A; Saneeva, L; Tuturov, N; Katbeh, I",Stomatologiia (Mosk),555,16

Attachment and entry of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 is mainly mediated by the spike glycoprotein. Here, we show that iota-carrageenan can inhibit the cell entry of the SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus in a dose dependent manner. SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus particles were efficiently neutralized with an IC50 value of 2.6 µg/ml iota-carrageenan. Experiments with patient isolated wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus showed an inhibition of replication in a similar range. In vitro data on iota-carrageenan against various Rhino- and endemic Coronaviruses showed similar IC50 values and translated readily into clinical effectiveness when a nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan demonstrated a reduction of severity and duration of symptoms of common cold caused by various respiratory viruses. Accordingly, our in vitro data on SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus and replication competent SARS-CoV-2 suggest that administration of iota-carrageenan may be an effective and safe prophylaxis or treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Morokutti-Kurz, Martina; Fröba, Maria; Graf, Philipp; Große, Maximilian; Grassauer, Andreas; Auth, Janina; Schubert, Ulrich; Prieschl-Grassauer, Eva",PLoS One,555,20

We designed this study to investigate the association between carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) elevation and SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 177 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who received plasma CEA assays during hospitalization. Patients with other causes of CEA elevation were excluded. Data regarding epidemiological and demographical characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and outcomes were analyzed. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the correlation between CEA levels and inflammation severity. RESULTS: 171 patients were included in the final study and 32 patients (18.7%) had raised serum of CEA (> 5 ng/ml), with a median (range) age of 66 (53-86). The median [interquartile range (IQR)] CEA level was 11.4 ng/ml (8.1-21.6), which was significantly higher than the upper limit of reference range. CEA level between 5-10 ng/ml was in 11 patients, 10-15 ng/ml in 10 patients, and > 15 ng/ml in 11 patients. No correlation was found between CEA levels and lymphocyte (R2 = 0.055; P = 0.10) nor CRP (R2 = 0.026; P = 0.38). The median levels of CEA were 20.0 ng/ml (IQR, 14.7-23.0) in non-survivors and 10.9 ng/ml (IQR 7.5-16.1) in survivors, and the difference between two groups was statistically significant (P = 0.048). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection might be another cause of CEA elevation, with nearly 20% of patients experienced transient and marked CEA increment during COVID-19 pneumonia. The false-positive results of CEA elevation might have clinical significance for patients with colorectal cancer.","Yang, Chongtu; Wang, Jianwen; Liu, Jiacheng; Huang, Songjiang; Xiong, Bin",J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,555,23

As part of a collaborative European study, this paper aims to explore the implementation of primary care selective-prevention services in five European countries. We assessed the implementation process of the selective-prevention services, participants' cardiometabolic profile and risk and participants' evaluation of the services, in terms of feasibility and impact in promoting a healthy lifestyle. (2) Methods: Eligible participants were primary care patients, 40-65 years of age, without any diagnosis of cardiometabolic disease. Two hundred patients were invited to participate per country. The extent to which participants adopted and completed the implementation of selective-prevention services was recorded. Patient demographics, lifestyle-related cardiometabolic risk factors and opinions on the implementation's feasibility were also collected. (3) Results: Acceptance rates varied from 19.5% (n = 39/200) in Sweden to 100% (n = 200/200) in the Czech Republic. Risk assessment completion rates ranged from 65.4% (n = 70/107) in Greece to 100% (n = 39/39) in Sweden. On a ten-point scale, the median (25-75% quartile) of participant-reported implementation feasibility ranged from 7.4 (6.9-7.8) in Greece to 9.2 (8.2-9.9) in Sweden. Willingness to change lifestyle exceeded 80% in all countries. (4) Conclusions: A substantial variation in the implementation of selective-prevention receptiveness and patient risk profile was observed among countries. Our findings suggest that the design and implementation of behavior change cardiometabolic programmes in each country should be informed by the local context and provide some background evidence towards this direction, which can be even more relevant during the current pandemic period.","Lionis, Christos; Anastasaki, Marilena; Bertsias, Antonios; Angelaki, Agapi; Carlsson, Axel C; Gudjonsdottir, Hrafnhildur; Wändell, Per; Larrabee Sonderlund, Anders; Thilsing, Trine; Søndergaard, Jens; Seifert, Bohumil; Kral, Norbert; De Wit, Niek J; Hollander, Monika; Korevaar, Joke; Schellevis, François",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),555,16

So far, gas exchange has been examined using transcutaneously measured partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), ergo-spirometry and impedance cardiography. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this structured investigation, arterial blood gas analysis in a 30-year-old female resident was carried out during a 13-hour day shift on the COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit of the University Hospital of Innsbruck, Austria. An FFP3 mask (3MTM AuraTM) with an exhalation valve was continuously worn, except for 1 break of 20 min. Arterial blood samples were obtained before putting on the PPE, and after 5 h, 9 h and 13 h of working in the contaminated area. RESULTS: During the multi-hour wearing time, an increase in PaCO2 (the baseline value: 29.3 mm Hg, the max. value: 38.9 mm Hg) and a continuous decrease in partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2, the baseline value: 102 mm Hg, the min. value: 80.8 mm Hg) was detectable.

Chest radiography through glass walls of an isolation room is a technique that could be immensely useful in the current COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to ensure quality and radiation safety while acquiring portable chest radiographs through the glass doors of isolation rooms using an adult anthropomorphic thorax phantom. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen chest radiographs were acquired utilizing different exposure factors without glass, through the smart glass, and through regular glass. Images were scored independently by 2 radiologists for quantum mottle and sharpness of anatomical structures using a 5-point Likert scale. Statistically significant differences in Likert scale scores and entrance surface dose (ESD) between images acquired without glass and through the smart and regular glass were tested. Interreader reliability was also evaluated. RESULTS: Compared with conventional radiography, equal or higher mean image quality scores (mottle and anatomical structures) were observed with the smart glass using 100 kVp at 12 mAs and 20 mAs and 125 kVp at 6.3 mAs (100 kVp at 2 mAs and 125 kVp at 3.2 mAs were used for conventional radiography observations). There was no statistically significant difference in the Likert scale scores for image quality and the entrance surface dose for radiographs acquired without glass, through the smart glass, and through regular glass. Backscatter from the smart glass was minimal at a distance of 3 m and was recorded as zero at a distance of 4 m from the x-ray tube outside an isolation room. CONCLUSIONS: Good-quality portable chest radiographs can be obtained safely through the smart glass doors of the isolation room. However, this technique does result in minor backscatter radiation. Modifications in the exposure factors (such as increasing milliampere seconds) may be required to optimize image quality while using this technique.","Rai, Archana; MacGregor, Kate; Hunt, Bryce; Gontar, Alex; Ditkofsky, Noah; Deva, Djeven; Mathur, Shobhit",Invest. radiol,555,26

We aimed to developed and validate a deep learning algorithm using EHR structured data to identify patients at risk for ARDS or in-hospital mortality in pre-COVID and COVID-19 inpatient population. Method: The initial cohort consisted of adult ICU patients on mechanical ventilation (MV) from 2017 to 2018 at 3 hospitals at Montefiore Medical Center. Independently trained physician reviewed all chest x-rays in patients with PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤ 300 to determine ARDS as per Berlin criteria. We used 66 discrete EHR variables to generate 135 features based on variable types. We longitudinally sampled hourly and missing data were forwardly imputed. We trained a preliminary Long Short-Term Memory network to determine the probability of ARDS or in-hospital mortality in the 2017-2018 cohort. Using active learning process, we applied this preliminary model to additional MV patients admitted between 2016-2017 and 2018-2019 to expand the sample size with additional ARDS and non-ARDS patients. The expanded pre-COVID cohort (2016-2019) was split into training and validation cohort (80 and 20%). A new and final LSTM model were trained on the pre-COVID training cohort. Validations were performed on the pre-COVID validation cohort and a population of mechanically ventilated and non-ventilated COVID-19 patients between March-April 2020. Result: The pre-COVID cohort included 3905 MV patients in the ICU from final 2016-2019. 1646 (42.4%) had ARDS and 1033 (26.5%) died during hospitalization. COVID-19 cohort included 5672 patients and 907 (16%) died. 803 (14.2%) were mechanically ventilated including 583 ARDS patients(10.3% of COVID cohort and 72.6% of MV COVID patients) and 418 (52.1%) who died (Table 1). The model ROC was 0.78 for pre-COVID validation cohort. At model cutoff 0.90, the sensitivity was 86% and specificity was 57% (Table 1) In the COVID-19 cohort, the ROC was 0.83 (sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 84%). On the COVID-19 +MV sub-cohort, the model ROC was 0.70 and accurately diagnosed 91.6% of ARDS or death. The model was able to identify ARDS or death close to the time of intubation and ARDS label time in both pre-COVID and COVID-19 cohort (Table 1). Conclusion: Our LSTM algorithm accurately and timely identified the probability ARDS or in-hospital in mechanically ventilated patients. When we applied the model to a larger cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 which had a higher prevalence of ARDS, the sensitivity, and positive predictive value remains high but specificity is much lower among MV patients.","Chen, J.; Mehrizi, R.; Aasman, B.; Mirhaji, P.; Gong, M.

In our study, we developed a new compartmental model that explains the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We calibrated our proposed model with daily COVID-19 data for the four Indian provinces, namely Jharkhand, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Chandigarh. We study the qualitative properties of the model including feasible equilibria and their stability with respect to the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$. The disease-free equilibrium becomes stable and the endemic equilibrium becomes unstable when the recovery rate of infected individuals increased but if the disease transmission rate remains higher then the endemic equilibrium always remain stable. For the estimated model parameters, $\mathcal{R}_0>1$ for all the four provinces, which suggests the significant outbreak of COVID-19.

We have previously identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and residues important for RBD–hACE2 association. Here, we further characterized the S protein by investigating the roles of the cytoplasmic tail and 19 residues located in the RBD in protein accumulation, receptor binding, and pseudotype virus entry. For these purposes, we first identified an entry-efficient S gene template from a pool of gene variants and used it as a backbone to generate a series of cytoplasmic tail deletion and single residue substitution mutants. Our results showed that: (i) deletion of 18 aa from the C-terminus enhanced the S protein accumulation and virus entry, which might be due to the deletion of intracellular retention signals; (ii) further deletion to residue 29 also enhanced the amount of S protein on the cell surface and in virion, but reduced virus entry by 25%, suggesting that residues 19–29 contributes to membrane fusion; (iii) a 29 aa-deletion mutant had a defect in anchoring on the plasma membrane, which led to a dramatic decrease of S protein in virion and virus entry; (iv) a total of 15 residues (Y498, V499, V531, G534, G537, D538, S540, G575, S576, E582, W585, Y590, T591, V593 and G594) within RBD were important for receptor binding and virus entry. They probably form three receptor binding motifs, and the third motif is conserved between NL63 and SARS-CoV.","Lin, Han-Xin; Feng, Yan; Tu, Xinming; Zhao, Xuesen; Hsieh, Chih-Heng; Griffin, Lauren; Junop, Murray; Zhang, Chengsheng",Virus Res,555,7

CASES: Both women had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with rapid clinical decompensation that required admission to the intensive care unit, intubation, and delivery by emergency cesarean section at 32 and 29 weeks. Both patients clinically improved in the first two postoperative days, but this was followed by clinical, laboratory and radiological deterioration on the third postoperative day; however, they both improved again after full anticoagulation. This pattern suggests the possible formation of pulmonary microthrombi in the early puerperium. We discuss the challenges faced by the multiprofessional team in the management of these patients.

The aim of this study was to describe the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in New Zealand via a nationwide serosurvey of blood donors. Samples (n = 9806) were collected over a month-long period (3 December 2020–6 January 2021) from donors aged 16–88 years. The sample population was geographically spread, covering 16 of 20 district health board regions. A series of Spike-based immunoassays were utilised, and the serological testing algorithm was optimised for specificity given New Zealand is a low prevalence setting. Eighteen samples were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, six of which were retrospectively matched to previously confirmed COVID-19 cases. A further four were from donors that travelled to settings with a high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, suggesting likely infection outside New Zealand. The remaining eight seropositive samples were from seven different district health regions for a true seroprevalence estimate, adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity, of 0.103% (95% confidence interval, 0.09–0.12%).

Pulmonary embolism as well as microembolization of vital organs may in these individuals be direct causes of death. The identification of patients at high risk of developing thrombosis may lead to targeted, more effective prophylactic treatment. The primary aim of this study was to test whether rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) at admission indicates hypercoagulopathy and predicts the disease severity, assessed as care level, in COVID-19 patients. The study was designed as a prospective, observational study where COVID-19 patients over 18 years admitted to hospital were eligible for inclusion. Patients were divided into two groups depending on care level: (1) regular wards or (2) wards with specialized ventilation support. Conventional coagulation tests, blood type and ROTEM were taken at admission. 60 patients were included; age 61 (median), 67% men, many with comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, diabetes). The ROTEM variables Maximum Clot Firmness (EXTEM-/FIBTEM-MCF) were higher in COVID-19 patients compared with in healthy controls (p < 0.001) and higher in severely ill patients compared with in patients at regular wards (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that hypercoagulopathy is present early in patients with mild to moderate disease, and more pronounced in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Non-O blood types were not overrepresented in COVID-19 positive patients. ROTEM variables showed hypercoagulopathy at admission and this pattern was more pronounced in patients with increased disease severity. If this feature is to be used to predict the risk of thromboembolic complications further studies are warranted.

Surprisingly, China’s exponential increase of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and its low-quality institutions and distinct cultural norms contradict these studies. This paper aims to tackle this puzzle by examining the role of cultural imports in cross-border M&As. Our empirical evidence suggests that the trade of cultural goods significantly increases the volume and realized economic gains of M&As from importing to exporting countries. Our results are robust to alternative measures and an instrumental variable approach. On exploring potential channels, we find that imported cultural goods could drive cultural convergence between countries and also mitigate the adverse effect of cultural distance on merger outcomes. We further show that cultural imports could help firms in overcoming contractual barriers at target countries.

Influenza infection is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure exacerbation) and mortality, and all‐cause mortality in patients with CVD. Infection with influenza leads to a systemic inflammatory and thrombogenic response in the host body, which further causes destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. Influenza vaccination has been shown to be protective against cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in several observational and prospective studies of at‐risk populations. Hence, many international guidelines recommend influenza vaccination for adults of all ages, especially for individuals with high‐risk conditions such as CVD. Despite these long‐standing recommendations, influenza vaccine uptake among US adults with CVD remains suboptimal. Specifically, vaccination uptake is strikingly low among patients aged <65 years, non‐Hispanic Black individuals, those without health insurance, and those with diminished access to healthcare services. Behavioral factors such as perceived vaccine efficacy, vaccine safety, and attitudes towards vaccination play an important role in vaccine acceptance at the individual and community levels. With the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic, there is a potential threat of a concurrent epidemic with influenza. This would be devastating for vulnerable populations such as adults with CVD, further stressing the need for ensuring adequate influenza vaccination coverage. In this review, we describe a variety of strategies to improve the uptake of influenza vaccination in patients with CVD through improved understanding of key sociodemographic determinants and behaviors that are associated with vaccination, or the lack thereof. We further discuss the potential use of relevant strategies for COVID‐19 vaccine uptake among those with CVD.","Bhugra, Priyanka; Grandhi, Gowtham R.; Mszar, Reed; Satish, Priyanka; Singh, Rahul; Blaha, Michael; Blankstein, Ron; Virani, Salim S.; Cainzos‐Achirica, Miguel; Nasir, Khurram",J Am Heart Assoc,555,1

Nepal has been severely affected by it, with an increasing number of confirmed cases and casualties in recent days, even after 8 months of the first case detected in China. As of 26 November 2020, there were over 227,600 confirmed cases of COVID in Nepal with 209,435 recovered cases and 1,412 deaths. This study aimed to compile public data available from the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP), Government of Nepal (GoN) and analyse the data of 104 deceased COVID-19 patients using IBM SPSS (Version 25.0). Additionally, this study also aimed to provide critical insights on response of the GoN to COVID-19 and way forward to confront unprecedented pandemic. Figures and maps were created using the Origin Lab (Version 2018) and QGIS (Version 3.10.8). Most of the reported cases were from Bagmati Province, the location of Nepal's capital city, Kathmandu. Among deceased cases, >69% of the patients were male and patients ≥54 years accounted for 67.9% (n = 923). Preliminary findings showed respiratory illness, diabetes, and chronic kidney diseases were the most common comorbid conditions associated with COVID-19 deaths in Nepal. Despite some efforts in the 8 months since the first case was detected, the government's response so far has been insufficient. Since the government eased the lockdown in July 2020, Nepal is facing a flood of COVID-19 cases. If no aggressive actions are taken, the epidemic is likely to result in significant morbidity and mortality in Nepal. The best way to curb the effect of the ongoing pandemic in a resource-limited country like Nepal is to increase testing, tracing, and isolation capacity, and to set up quality quarantine centers throughout the nation. A comprehensive health literacy campaign, quality care of older adults and those with comorbidity will also result in the effective management of the ongoing pandemic.","Rayamajhee, Binod; Pokhrel, Anil; Syangtan, Gopiram; Khadka, Saroj; Lama, Bhupendra; Rawal, Lal Bahadur; Mehata, Suresh; Mishra, Shyam Kumar; Pokhrel, Roshan; Yadav, Uday Narayan",Front Public Health,555,1

In the COVID 19 pandemic episode the use of these devices has become widespread, but, due to the shortage of conventional CPAP devices, alternative devices have been manufactured. The objective of this study is to describe the use of these devices, as well as their efficacy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data are collected from patients admitted for Pneumonia due to COVID 19 at the IFEMA Field Hospital. Data are collected from 23 patients with respiratory failure and need for ventilatory support. RESULTS: Study carried out on a total of 23 patients, dated admission to IFEMA. Alternative CPAP was used in five patients (21.7%), while ventilatory support with a reservoir mask or Ventimask Venturi effect was used in the remaining 18 patients (78.3%). A progressive increase in saturation is observed in those patients in whom alternative CPAP was used (from 94% on average to 98% and 99% on average after 30 and 60 min with the mask, respectively), although this change was not significant (p = 0.058 and p = 0.122 respectively). No significant change in RF was observed at the beginning and end of the measurement in patients who used alternative CPAP (p = 0.423), but among those who did not use alternative CPAP (p = 0.001). A statistically significant improvement in the variable oxygen saturation / fraction inspired by oxygen is observed in patients who used alternative CPAP (p = 0.040) CONCLUSION: The use of these devices has helped the ventilatory work of several patients by improving their oxygenation parameters.

More recently, there have been several reports of increased thrombotic events in these patients [3‐6]. From a laboratory perspective, this hypercoagulability is reflected in the marked elevation of the fibrinolytic marker, D‐dimer, in almost all hospitalised COVID‐19 patients [7].

Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the R_0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R_0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a tunneling effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.

Electron microscopy (EM) overcomes some problems associated with particle variability and has been an important tool for investigating coronavirus ultrastructure. However, EM sample preparation requires that the specimen be dried onto a carbon support film before imaging, collapsing internal particle structure in the case of coronaviruses. Moreover, conventional EM achieves image contrast by immersing the specimen briefly in heavy-metal-containing stain, which reveals some features while obscuring others. Electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) instead employs a porous support film, to which the specimen is adsorbed and flash-frozen. Specimens preserved in vitreous ice over holes in the support film can then be imaged without additional staining. Cryo-EM, coupled with single-particle image analysis techniques, makes it possible to examine the size, structure and arrangement of coronavirus structural components in fully hydrated, native virions.

We hypothesised that the early, strict lockdown that restricted individuals’ movements in Uganda limited access to services. METHODS: An observational study, using routinely collected data from Electronic Medical Records, was carried out, in Kawempe district, Kampala. An interrupted time series analysis assessed the impact on maternal, neonatal, child, sexual and reproductive health services from July 2019 to December 2020. Descriptive statistics summarised the main outcomes before (July 2019–March 2020), during (April 2020–June 2020) and after the national lockdown (July 2020–December 2020). RESULTS: Between 1 July 2019 and 31 December 2020, there were 14 401 antenatal clinic, 33 499 deliveries, 111 658 childhood service and 57 174 sexual health attendances. All antenatal and vaccination services ceased in lockdown for 4 weeks. During the 3-month lockdown, the number of antenatal attendances significantly decreased and remain below pre-COVID levels (370 fewer/month). Attendances for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV dropped then stabilised. Increases during lockdown and immediately postlockdown included the number of women treated for high blood pressure, eclampsia and pre-eclampsia (218 more/month), adverse pregnancy outcomes (stillbirths, low-birth-weight and premature infant births), the rate of neonatal unit admissions, neonatal deaths and abortions. Maternal mortality remained stable. Immunisation clinic attendance declined while neonatal death rate rose (from 39 to 49/1000 livebirths). The number of children treated for pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria decreased during lockdown. CONCLUSION: The Ugandan response to COVID-19 negatively impacted maternal, child and neonatal health, with an increase seen in pregnancy complications and fetal and infant outcomes, likely due to delayed care-seeking behaviour. Decreased vaccination clinic attendance leaves a cohort of infants unprotected, affecting all vaccine-preventable diseases. Future pandemic responses must consider impacts of movement restrictions and access to preventative services to protect maternal and child health.","Burt, Jessica Florence; Ouma, Joseph; Lubyayi, Lawrence; Amone, Alexander; Aol, Lorna; Sekikubo, Musa; Nakimuli, Annettee; Nakabembe, Eve; Mboizi, Robert; Musoke, Philippa; Kyohere, Mary; Namara Lugolobi, Emily; Khalil, Asma; Le Doare, Kirsty",BMJ Glob Health,555,1

The present study is aimed at exploring the associations of excess mortality with some indices related to the epidemic and its management. Methods Data on all-cause mortality from February 20th to March 31st, in years from 2015 to 2020, and demographic, socioeconomic and healthcare organization data of each Italian region were obtained from Italian Institute of Statistics. Non-COVID19-Imputed Excess Mortality (NCIEM) was calculated as the difference between excess 2020 mortality and reported COVID19 mortality. The association of NCIEM with the rate of COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 mortality, and other potential moderators was assessed using linear regression models. Results The nationwide number of excess deaths, COVID-19 deaths was 26,701 and 13,710, respectively, with a difference of 12,991. NCIEM in different Regions showed a direct correlation with COVID-19 mortality (r2 = 0.61, p < 0.001) and total cases (r2 = 0.30, p = 0.012), and an inverse correlation with cases/total tests ratio (r2 = 0.49, p = 0.001). Direct correlations were also found with the proportion of institutionalized elderly, whereas inverse correlations were observed with prevalence of diabetes, cardiovascular mortality, and density of general practitioners. Conclusions The impact of the COVID19 epidemic on all-cause mortality is considerably greater than that indicated by official counts of victims. Limited testing capacity and causes of death other than COVID19 could contribute to the increase in overall mortality rates.","Mannucci, Edoardo; Nreu, Besmir; Monami, Matteo",Int J Infect Dis,555,22

Cytokines are essential for cell-to-cell communication and viral clearance in the immune system, but excessive cytokines can cause serious immune pathology. Deaths caused by severe influenza are usually related to cytokine storms. The recent literature has described the mechanism behind the cytokine–storm network and how it can exacerbate host pathological damage. Biological factors such as sex, age, and obesity may cause biological differences between different individuals, which affects cytokine storms induced by the influenza virus. In this review, we summarize the mechanism behind influenza virus cytokine storms and the differences in cytokine storms of different ages and sexes, and in obesity.","Gu, Yinuo; Zuo, Xu; Zhang, Siyu; Ouyang, Zhuoer; Jiang, Shengyu; Wang, Fang; Wang, Guoqiang",Viruses,555,1

As the virus infected cases and mortality rate of this disease is increasing exponentially, scientists and researchers all over the world are relentlessly working to understand this new virus along with possible treatment regimens by discovering active therapeutic agents and vaccines. So, there is an urgent requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by SARS CoV 2. Methods and findings We perform the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate clinical recovery, in other words repurposing of existing drugs. The vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time. Recently, remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in Machine Learning (ML) technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process. Consequently, a detailed study using ML for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required. Here, we report the ML model based on the Naive Bayes algorithm, which has an accuracy of around 73% to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study predicts around ten FDA approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing. Among all, we suggest that the antiretroviral drug Atazanavir (DrugBank ID DB01072) would probably be one of the most effective drugs based on the selected criterions. Conclusions Our study can help clinical scientists in being more selective in identifying and testing the therapeutic agents for COVID 19 treatment. The ML based approach for drug discovery as reported here can be a futuristic smart drug designing strategy for community applications.","Mahapatra, Sovesh; Nath, Prathul; Chatterjee, Manisha; Das, Neeladrisingha; Kalita, Deepjyoti; Roy, Partha; Satapathi, Soumitra",,555,24

METHODS: We conducted a population cohort study using linked data from adults attending public sector health facilities in the Western Cape, South Africa. We used Cox-proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, location and comorbidities to examine the association between HIV, tuberculosis and COVID-19 death from 1 March-9 June 2020 among (i) public sector “active patients” (≥1 visit in the 3 years before March 2020), (ii) laboratory-diagnosed COVID-19 cases and (iii) hospitalized COVID-19 cases. We calculated the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for COVID-19 comparing HIV positive vs. negative adults using modelled population estimates. RESULTS: Among 3,460,932 patients (16% HIV positive), 22,308 were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 625 died. COVID-19 death was associated with male sex, increasing age, diabetes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease. HIV was associated with COVID-19 mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.70-2.70), with similar risks across strata of viral load and immunosuppression. Current and previous tuberculosis were associated with COVID-19 death (aHR [95%CI] 2.70 [1.81-4.04] and 1.51 [1.18-1.93] respectively). The SMR for COVID-19 death associated with HIV was 2.39 (95%CI 1.96-2.86); population attributable fraction 8.5% (95%CI 6.1-11.1). CONCLUSION: While our findings may over-estimate HIV- and tuberculosis-associated COVID-19 mortality risks due to residual confounding, both HIV and current tuberculosis were independently associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. The associations between age, sex and other comorbidities and COVID-19 mortality were similar to other settings.","Boulle, Andrew; Davies, Mary-Ann; Hussey, Hannah; Ismail, Muzzammil; Morden, Erna; Vundle, Ziyanda; Zweigenthal, Virginia; Mahomed, Hassan; Paleker, Masudah; Pienaar, David; Tembo, Yamanya; Lawrence, Charlene; Isaacs, Washiefa; Mathema, Hlengani; Allen, Derick; Allie, Taryn; Bam, Jamy-Lee; Buddiga, Kasturi; Dane, Pierre; Heekes, Alexa; Matlapeng, Boitumelo; Mutemaringa, Themba; Muzarabani, Luckmore; Phelanyane, Florence; Pienaar, Rory; Rode, Catherine; Smith, Mariette; Tiffin, Nicki; Zinyakatira, Nesbert; Cragg, Carol; Marais, Frederick; Mudaly, Vanessa; Voget, Jacqueline; Davids, Jody; Roodt, Francois; van Zyl Smit, Nellis; Vermeulen, Alda; Adams, Kevin; Audley, Gordon; Bateman, Kathleen; Beckwith, Peter; Bernon, Marc; Blom, Dirk; Boloko, Linda; Botha, Jean; Boutall, Adam; Burmeister, Sean; Cairncross, Lydia; Calligaro, Gregory; Coccia, Cecilia; Corin, Chadwin; Daroowala, Remy; Dave, Joel A; De Bruyn, Elsa; De Villiers, Martin; Deetlefs, Mimi; Dlamini, Sipho; Du Toit, Thomas; Endres, Wilhelm; Europa, Tarin; Fieggan, Graham; Figaji, Anthony; Frankenfeld, Petro; Gatley, Elizabeth; Gina, Phindile; Govender, Evashan; Grobler, Rochelle; Gule, Manqoba Vusumuzi; Hanekom, Christoff; Held, Michael; Heynes, Alana; Hlatswayo, Sabelo; Hodkinson, Bridget; Holtzhausen, Jeanette; Hoosain, Shakeel; Jacobs, Ashely; Kahn, Miriam; Kahn, Thania; Khamajeet, Arvin; Khan, Joubin; Khan, Riaasat; Khwitshana, Alicia; Knight, Lauren; Kooverjee, Sharita; Krogscheepers, Rene; Jacque Kruger, Jean; Kuhn, Suzanne; Laubscher, Kim; Lazarus, John; Le Roux, Jacque; Lee Jones, Scott; Levin, Dion; Maartens, Gary; Majola, Thina; Manganyi, Rodgers; Marais, David; Marais, Suzaan; Maritz, Francois; Maughan, Deborah; Mazondwa, Simthandile; Mbanga, Luyanda; Mbatani, Nomonde; Mbena, Bulewa; Meintjes, Graeme; Mendelson, Marc; Möller, Ernst; Moore, Allison; Ndebele, Babalwa; Nortje, Marc; Ntusi, Ntobeko; Nyengane, Funeka; Ofoegbu, Chima; Papavarnavas, Nectarios; Peter, Jonny; Pickard, Henri; Pluke, Kent; Raubenheimer, Peter J; Robertson, Gordon; Rozmiarek, Julius; Sayed, A; Scriba, Matthias; Sekhukhune, Hennie; Singh, Prasun; Smith, Elsabe; Soldati, Vuyolwethu; Stek, Cari; van den berg, Robert; van der Merwe, Le Roux; Venter, Pieter; Vermooten, Barbra; Viljoen, Gerrit; Viranna, Santhuri; Vogel, Jonno; Vundla, Nokubonga; Wasserman, Sean; Zitha, Eddy; Lomas-Marais, Vanessa; Lombard, Annie; Stuve, Katrin; Viljoen, Werner; Basson, De Vries; Le Roux, Sue; Linden-Mars, Ethel; Victor, Lizanne; Wates, Mark; Zwanepoel, Elbe; Ebrahim, Nabilah; Lahri, Sa'ad; Mnguni, Ayanda; Crede, Thomas; de Man, Martin; Evans, Katya; Hendrikse, Clint; Naude, Jonathan; Parak, Moosa; Szymanski, Patrick; Van Koningsbruggen, Candice; Abrahams, Riezaah; Allwood, Brian; Botha, Christoffel; Henndrik Botha, Matthys; Broadhurst, Alistair; Claasen, Dirkie; Daniel, Che; Dawood, Riyaadh; du Preez, Marie; Du Toit, Nicolene; Erasmus, Kobie; Koegelenberg, Coenraad F N; Gabriel, Shiraaz; Hugo, Susan; Jardine, Thabiet; Johannes, Clint; Karamchand, Sumanth; Lalla, Usha; Langenegger, Eduard; Louw, Eize; Mashigo, Boitumelo; Mhlana, Nonte; Mnqwazi, Chizama; Moodley, Ashley; Moodley, Desiree; Moolla, Saadiq; Mowlana, Abdurasiet; Nortje, Andre; Olivier, Elzanne; Parker, Arifa; Paulsen, Chané; Prozesky, Hans; Rood, Jacques; Sabela, Tholakele; Schrueder, Neshaad; Sithole, Nokwanda; Sithole, Sthembiso; Taljaard, Jantjie J; Titus, Gideon; Van Der Merwe, Tian; van Schalkwyk, Marije; Vazi, Luthando; Viljoen, Abraham J; Yazied Chothia, Mogamat; Naidoo, Vanessa; Alan Wallis, Lee; Abbass, Mumtaz; Arendse, Juanita; Armien, Rizqa; Bailey, Rochelle; Bello, Muideen; Carelse, Rachel; Forgus, Sheron; Kalawe, Nosi; Kariem, Saadiq; Kotze, Mariska; Lucas, Jonathan; McClaughlin, Juanita; Murie, Kathleen; Najjaar, Leilah; Petersen, Liesel; Porter, James; Shaw, Melanie; Stapar, Dusica; Williams, Michelle; Aldum, Linda; Berkowitz, Natacha; Girran, Raakhee; Lee, Kevin; Naidoo, Lenny; Neumuller, Caroline; Anderson, Kim; Begg, Kerrin; Boerlage, Lisa; Cornell, Morna; de Waal, Renée; Dudley, Lilian; English, René; Euvrard, Jonathan; Groenewald, Pam; Jacob, Nisha; Jaspan, Heather; Kalk, Emma; Levitt, Naomi; Malaba, Thoko; Nyakato, Patience; Patten, Gabriela; Schneider, Helen; Shung King, Maylene; Tsondai, Priscilla; Van Duuren, James; van Schaik, Nienke; Blumberg, Lucille; Cohen, Cheryl; Govender, Nelesh; Jassat, Waasila; Kufa, Tendesayi; McCarthy, Kerrigan; Morris, Lynn; Hsiao, Nei-yuan; Marais, Ruan; Ambler, Jon; Ngwenya, Olina; Osei-Yeboah, Richard; Johnson, Leigh; Kassanjee, Reshma; Tamuhla, Tsaone",Clin Infect Dis,555,1

We propose a method comprising data analytics and machine learning classification for evaluating the effectiveness of lockdown regulations. Lockdown regulations should be reviewed on a regular basis by governments, to enable reasonable control over the outbreak. The model aims to measure the efficiency of lockdown procedures for various countries. The model shows a direct correlation between lockdown procedures and the infection rate. Lockdown efficiency is measured by finding a correlation coefficient between lockdown attributes and the infection rate. The lockdown attributes include retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces, residential, and schools. Our results show that combining all the independent attributes in our study resulted in a higher correlation (0.68) to the dependent value Interquartile 3 (Q3).

However, the impact of a pandemic outbreak on healthcare systems is yet to be clearly defined. Therefore, this work aims to describe and analyze specific areas of workload among different groups of healthcare workers during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A sample of N = 8088 persons working in the German-speaking healthcare sector participated in the VOICE/egePan online survey, which addressed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the second quarter of 2020. We used 15 self-constructed items, based on the work of Matsuishi et al. (2012), to identify potential COVID-19-specific topics. Results: N = 7542 records of healthcare workers were analyzed. Of these, 60.80% reported, retrospectively, an increase in stress since the outbreak of the pandemic. Problem areas tended to be indicated more frequently by the women surveyed than by the men. Nurses, paramedics and medical technicians reported the highest fear of infecting others while physicians reported the highest fear of physical or mental exhaustion. With respect to age, older respondents indicated less fear and felt more protected. Men and people living alone were more likely to use dysfunctional coping strategies. Migrants reported a higher fear of becoming infected or infecting others as well as they reported about increased levels of smoking. Discussion: Retrospectively, the COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in stress among healthcare workers. Problem areas have different focuses with regard to different living situations, environmental conditions and professions. In order to lay the best basis for healthy and efficient work, it seems necessary to take measures especially tailored to the needs of different groups of healthcare workers.","Jerg-Bretzke, Lucia; Kempf, Maximilian; Jarczok, Marc Nicolas; Weimer, Katja; Hirning, Christian; Gündel, Harald; Erim, Yesim; Morawa, Eva; Geiser, Franziska; Hiebel, Nina; Weidner, Kerstin; Albus, Christian; Beschoner, Petra",Int J Environ Res Public Health,555,31

Our reviews have shown that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have life-threatening acute brain dysfunction (ABD), ranging from altered mental status/delirium to stupor/coma. Altered mental status/delirium was the most common manifestation of ABD caused by severe COVID-19. The prevalence of altered mental status and/or delirium was up to 66-79.5%, and prevalence of coma was 10%. The most common clinical type of COVID-19-associated ABD was COVID-19-associated acute stroke including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (n > 350 cases), followed by COVID-19-associated encephalopathy (n > 200 cases), and COVID-19-associated central nervous system (CNS) infection (n > 70 cases). According to the Sepsis-3 criteria, we confess that severe COVID-19-associated ABD with ARDS and altered mental status is related to sepsis. Moreover, we also review the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19-associated ABD with sepsis. In view of the fact that COVID-19 is at the peak of epidemic worldwide, we hope that this review will provide evidence of COVID-19 sepsis threating to the brain dysunction.

Policymakers have therefore created temporary indication-specific market exclusivities to incentivize drug innovators to run new clinical investigations. The effectiveness of these exclusivities is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether generic entry impacts the probability of new indication additions. METHODS: For a cohort of all new small-molecule drugs approved by the FDA between July 1997 and May 2020, we tracked new indications added for the subset of drugs that experienced generic entry during the observation period and then analyzed how the probability of a new indication changed with the number of years since/to generic entry. RESULTS: Of the 197 new drugs that subsequently experienced generic entry, only 64 (32%) had at least one new indication added. The probability of a new indication addition peaked above 4% between 7 and 8 years prior to generic entry and then to dropped to near zero 15 years after FDA approval. We show that the limited duration of exclusivity reduces the number of secondary indications significantly. CONCLUSION: Status quo for most drug innovators is creating novel one-indication products. Despite indication-specific exclusivities, the imminence of generic entry still has a detectable impact on reducing the chances of new indication additions. There is much room for improvement when it comes to incentivizing clinical investigations for new uses and unlocking existing medicines’ full therapeutic potential.","Sahragardjoonegani, Babak; Beall, Reed F.; Kesselheim, Aaron S.; Hollis, Aidan",J Pharm Policy Pract,555,19

Interventions to alleviate the psychological impact of the pandemic are urgently needed. Whether mindfulness practice may protect against the harmful emotional effects of a pandemic crisis remains hitherto unknown. We investigated the influence of mindfulness training on mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. We hypothesized that mindfulness practitioners might manifest less pandemic-related distress, depression, anxiety, and stress than non-practitioners and that more frequent practice would be associated with an improvement in mental health during the pandemic. Therefore, we assessed pandemic-related distress and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as the frequency of meditation practice at the peak of new infections (Feb 4–5; N = 673) and three weeks later (Feb 29–30; N = 521) in mindfulness practitioners via online questionnaires. Self-reported symptoms were also collected from non-practitioners at peak time only (N = 1550). We found lower scores of pandemic-related distress in mindfulness practitioners compared to non-practitioners. In general, older participants showed fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety. In younger practitioners, pandemic-related distress decreased from peak to follow-up. Importantly, increased mindfulness training during the preceding two weeks was associated with lower scores of depression and anxiety at both assessments. Likewise, practice frequency predicted individual improvement in scores of depression, anxiety, and stress at follow-up. Our results indicate that mindfulness meditation might be a viable low-cost intervention to mitigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis and future pandemics.","Zhu, Julie Lei; Schülke, Rasmus; Vatansever, Deniz; Xi, Dayou; Yan, Junjie; Zhao, Hanqing; Xie, Xiaohua; Feng, Jianfeng; Chen, Mark Yuting; Sahakian, Barbara Jacquelyn; Wang, Shouyan",Transl Psychiatry,555,16

Computed tomography (CT) is an informative tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. Many deep learning approaches on CT images have been proposed and brought promising performance. However, due to the high complexity and non-transparency of deep models, the explanation of the diagnosis process is challenging, making it hard to evaluate whether such approaches are reliable. In this paper, we propose a visual interpretation architecture for the explanation of the deep learning models and apply the architecture in COVID-19 diagnosis. Our architecture designs a comprehensive interpretation about the deep model from different perspectives, including the training trends, diagnostic performance, learned features, feature extractors, the hidden layers, the support regions for diagnostic decision, and etc. With the interpretation architecture, researchers can make a comparison and explanation about the classification performance, gain insight into what the deep model learned from images, and obtain the supports for diagnostic decisions. Our deep model achieves the diagnostic result of 94.75%, 93.22%, 96.69%, 97.27%, and 91.88% in the criteria of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, which are 8.30%, 4.32%, 13.33%, 10.25%, and 6.19% higher than that of the compared traditional methods. The visualized features in 2-D and 3-D spaces provide the reasons for the superiority of our deep model. Our interpretation architecture would allow researchers to understand more about how and why deep models work, and can be used as interpretation solutions for any deep learning models based on convolutional neural network. It can also help deep learning methods to take a step forward in the clinical COVID-19 diagnosis field.","Wan, Yuchai; Zhou, Hongen; Zhang, Xun",Entropy (Basel),555,20

METHODS: We conducted a population-based, matched cohort study among adult residents from Ontario, Canada, from January to December 2020. We created cohorts for the following IMIDs: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, multiple sclerosis (MS), iritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), polymyalgia rheumatica and vasculitis. Each patient was matched with five patients without IMIDs based on socio-demographic factors. We estimated the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 testing and infection in IMIDs and non-IMIDs patients. Multivariable logistic regressions assessed odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: We studied 493,499 patients with IMIDs and 2,466,946 patients without IMIDs. Patients with IMIDs were more likely to have at least one SARS-CoV-2 test, versus patients without IMIDs (27.4% vs. 22.7%), but the proportion testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was identical (0.9% in both groups). Overall, IMIDs patients had 20% higher odds of being tested for SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio (OR) 1.20, 95% CI 1.19, 1.21). The odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection varied across IMIDs groups but was not significantly elevated for most IMID groups compared with non-IMIDs. The odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection was lower in IBD and MS and marginally higher in RA and iritis.

Despite the current literature about the cardiac effects of COVID-19 in children, more information is required. We aimed to determine both cardiovascular and arrhythmia assessment via electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated seventy children who were hospitalized with COVID-19 infections and seventy children as normal control group through laboratory findings, electrocardiography (ECG), and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). RESULTS: We observed significantly increased levels of Tp-Te, Tp-Te/QT, and Tp-Te/QTc compared with the control group. Twenty-five of 70 (35.7%) patients had fragmented QRS (fQRS) without increased troponin levels. On the other hand, none of the patients had pathologic corrected QT(QTc) prolongation during the illness or its treatment. On TTE, 20 patients had mild mitral insufficiency, among whom only five had systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction < 55%). There was no significant difference between the patient and control groups, except for isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) in terms of mean systolic and diastolic function parameters. IVRT of COVID patients was significantly lower than that of control group. CONCLUSION: Despite all the adult studies, the effects of COVID‐19 on myocardial function are not well established in children. The thought that children are less affected by the illness may be a misconception.","ÇEVİK, Berna Şaylan; ARICI, Şule; ERGENÇ, Zeynep; KEPENEKLİ, Eda; GÜNAL, Özge; YAKUT, Nurhayat",Turk J Med Sci,555,27

However, it is not known if the risk to poor health outcomes is consistent across population subgroups. This scoping review explores differential impacts of precarious employment on health. METHODS: Relevant studies published between 2009 and February 2019 were identified across PubMed, OVID Medline, PsycINFO, and Scopus. Articles were included if (1) they presented original data, (2) examined precarious employment within one of the subpopulations of interest, and (3) examined health outcomes. RESULTS: Searches yielded 279 unique results, of which 14 met the eligibility criteria. Of the included studies, 12 studies examined differences between gender, 3 examined the health impacts on young individuals, and 3 examined the health of migrant workers. Mental health was explored in nine studies, general health in four studies, and mortality in two studies. CONCLUSION: Mental health was generally poorer in both male and female employees as a result of precarious employment, and males were also at higher risk of mortality.

However, the utilization rate and types of herbal and dietary supplements during the COVID-19 pandemic are largely unknown. Methods: This was an online questionnaire-based cross-sectional study that used convenience sampling and social media platforms (Telegram(®), Twitter(®), and WhatsApp(®)) to disseminate a 12-item questionnaire across the Saudi general public aged 18 years and above. The questionnaire inquired about the sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, education, geographical location), presence of chronic health conditions and the use of prescription medications, awareness of the viral nature of COVID-19 infection and its common symptoms, and the commonly utilized herbal and/or dietary supplements. Results: Sixty-four percent of the 1473 participants reported using herbal and/or dietary supplements for the purpose of boosting their immune system to prevent COVID-19 infection. In addition, 88.2% of the respondents were misinformed about the manifestation of COVID-19 symptoms. Most of the participants were Saudi (91.9%), aged 49 years and younger (83%), female (52%), and healthy (81%). Honey (46%), lemon (45%), ginger (36%), vitamin C (32%), black seed (26%), garlic (26%), and turmeric (19%) were the most commonly used herbal and/or dietary supplements by the participants. Saudi nationals (OR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.08 to 2.6, p = 0.02), older adults (OR = 1.30, 95% CI:1.10 to 1.55, p = 0.002), and those taking prescription medications had higher odds of using dietary and/or herbal supplements (OR = 3.31, 95% CI: 2.61 to 4.18, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: The utilization rate of herbal and dietary supplements among the Saudi public during the COVID-19 pandemic is high.

We explored the association between Hispanic ethnicity and outcomes in COVID‐19 patients in Long Island, New York. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 2,039 Hispanic and non‐Hispanic Caucasian patients testing positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 between March 7 and May 23, 2020, at a large suburban academic tertiary care hospital near New York City. We explored the association of ethnicity with need for intensive care unit (ICU), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality. RESULTS: Of all patients, 1,079 (53%) were non‐Hispanic Caucasians and 960 (47%) were Hispanic. Hispanic patients presented in higher numbers than expected for our catchment area. Compared with Caucasians, Hispanics were younger (45 years vs. 59 years), had fewer comorbidities (66% with no comorbidities vs. 40%), were less likely to have commercial insurance (35% vs. 59%), or were less likely to come from a nursing home (2% vs. 10%). In univariate comparisons, Hispanics were less likely to be admitted (37% vs. 59%) or to die (3% vs. 10%). Age, shortness of breath, congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypoxemia, and presentation from nursing homes were associated with admission. Male sex and hypoxemia were associated with ICU admission. Male sex, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypoxemia were associated with IMV. Male sex, CHF, CAD, and hypoxemia were associated with mortality. After other factors were adjusted for, Hispanics were less likely to be admitted (odds ratio = 0.62, 95% confidence interval = 0.52 to 0.92) but Hispanic ethnicity was not associated with ICU admission, IMV, or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Hispanics presented at higher rates than average for our population but outcomes among Hispanic patients with COVID‐19 were similar to those of Caucasian patients.","Valenzuela, Rolando G.; Michelen, Yamil; Bracey, Alexander; Cruz, Priscilla; Fombonne, Benjamin; Fries, Bettina C.; Mallon, William K.; Fernandes, Rafael; Thode, Henry C.; Singer, Adam J.",Acad Emerg Med,555,6

We describe the changes to treatment and preliminary analysis of the association with patients' substance use and well-being. METHODS A pre-post comparison of treatment conditions and patient self-reported outcomes using data extracted from electronic medical records in the 5 months before (December 2019-April 2020) and after (May 2020-September 2020) changes were implemented in three public treatment services in South Eastern Sydney Local Health District. RESULTS Data are available for 429/460 (93%) patients. Few (21, 5%) dropped out of treatment. In the 'post' period there was significantly more use of depot buprenorphine (12-24%), access to any take-away doses (TAD; 24-69%), access to ≥6 TAD per week (7-31%), pharmacy dosing (24-52%) and telehealth services. There were significant reductions in average opioid and benzodiazepine use, increases in cannabis use, with limited group changes in social conditions, or quality of life, psychological and physical health. At an individual level, 22% of patients reported increases in their use of either alcohol, opioids, benzodiazepines or stimulants of ≥4 days in the past 4 weeks. Regression analysis indicates increases in substance use were associated with higher levels of supervised dosing. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS These preliminary findings suggest that the modified model of care continued to provide safe and effective treatment, during the pandemic. Notably, there was no association between more TAD and significant increases in substance use. Limitations are discussed and further evaluation is needed.","Lintzeris, Nicholas; Deacon, Rachel M; Hayes, Victoria; Cowan, Tracy; Mills, Llewellyn; Parvaresh, Laila; Harvey Dodds, Lucy; Jansen, Louisa; Dojcinovic, Raelene; Leung, Man Cho; Demirkol, Apo; Finch, Therese; Mammen, Kristie",Drug and alcohol review,555,17

Here, we show that directly lysed saliva samples can serve as a suitable source for viral RNA detection that is less expensive and can be as efficient as the classical protocol, which involves column purification of the viral RNA. In addition, it bypasses the need for swab sampling, decreases the risk of the health care personnel involved in the testing process, and accelerates the diagnostic procedure.","Moreno-Contreras, Joaquín; Espinoza, Marco A.; Sandoval-Jaime, Carlos; Cantú-Cuevas, Marco A.; Barón-Olivares, Héctor; Ortiz-Orozco, Oscar D.; Muñoz-Rangel, Asunción V.; Hernández-de la Cruz, Manuel; Eroza-Osorio, César M.; Arias, Carlos F.; López, Susana",J Clin Microbiol,555,29

DATA SOURCES: Medline, Policy File, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched to locate academic journal articles. Other sources reviewed included texts on the topics of vaccine history and policy, government agency reports, and reports from independent think tanks. Keywords included vaccines, immunizations, supply, demand, and policy. STUDY SELECTION: Search criteria were limited to English language and human studies. Articles pertaining to vaccine demand, supply, and public policy were selected and reviewed for inclusion. DATA EXTRACTION: By the authors. DATA SYNTHESIS: Vaccines are biologic medications, therefore making their development and production more difficult and costly compared with “small-molecule” drugs. Research and development costs for vaccines can exceed $800 million, and development may require 10 years or more. Strict manufacturing regulations and facility upgrades add to these costs. Policy options to increase and stabilize the supply of vaccines include those aimed at increasing supply, such as government subsidies for basic vaccine research, liability protection for manufacturers, and fast-track approval for new vaccines. Options to increase vaccine demand include advance purchase commitments, government stockpiles, and government financing for select populations. CONCLUSION: High development costs and multiple barriers to entry have led to a decline in the number of vaccine manufacturers. Although a number of vaccine policies have met with mixed success in increasing the supply of and demand for vaccines, a variety of concerns remain, including developing vaccines for complex pathogens and increasing immunization rates with available vaccines. New policy innovations such as advance market commitments and Medicare Part D vaccine coverage have been implemented and may aid in resolving some of the problems in the vaccine industry.","Muzumdar, Jagannath M.; Cline, Richard R.",J Am Pharm Assoc (2003),555,1

In this new situation, nurses were challenged to develop new approaches to involve family members in patient care. A better understanding of these changes and the experiences of nurses is essential to make an adaptation of procedures, and to secure a family-centred approach in care as much as possible. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate how family involvement had taken place, and to explore the experiences of nurses with family involvement during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, we aimed to formulate recommendations for the involvement of family. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study using patient record review and focus-group interviews between April and July 2020. We reviewed records of patients with confirmed COVID-19, who were admitted to the COVID-19 wards at two affiliated university hospitals in the Netherlands. All records were searched for notations referring to family involvement. In two focus-groups, nurses who worked at the COVID-19 wards were invited to share their experiences. The Rigorous and Accelerated Data Reduction (RADaR) method was used to collect, reduce and analyse the data. RESULTS: In total, 189 patient records were reviewed and nine nurses participated in the focus-group meetings. Patient records revealed infrequent and often unstructured communication with focus on physical condition. Nurses confirmed that communication with family was far less than before and that the physical condition of the patient was predominant. The involvement of family in care was limited to practicalities, although more involvement was described in end-of-life situations. Nurses experienced moral distress due to the visiting restrictions, though some acknowledged that they had experienced the direct patient care so intense and burdensome, that family contact simply felt too much. CONCLUSION: The communication with and involvement of family in hospital care changed enormously during the COVID-19 outbreak. Based on the identified themes, we formulated recommendations that may be helpful for family-centered care in hospitals during periods of restricted visiting policy.","Maaskant, J.M.; Jongerden, I.P.; Bik, J.; Joosten, M.; Musters, S.; Storm-Versloot, M.N.; Wielenga, J.; Eskes, A.M.",Int J Nurs Stud,555,26

Additionally, the fear of COVID-19 contagion delays the consultation of patients, resulting in the deterioration of their acute diseases by the time of consultation. In the specific case of urgent digestive surgery patients, both factors significantly worsen the postoperative course and prognosis. Main working hypothesis: infection by COVID-19 increases postoperative 30-day-mortality for any cause in patients submitted to emergency/urgent general or gastrointestinal surgery. Likewise, hospital collapse during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic increased 30-day-mortality for any cause. Hence, the main objective of this study is to estimate the cumulative incidence of mortality at 30-days-after-surgery. Secondary objectives are: to estimate the cumulative incidence of postoperative complications and to develop a specific postoperative risk propensity model for COVID-19-infected patients. A multicenter, observational retrospective cohort study (COVID-CIR-study) will be carried out in consecutive patients operated on for urgent digestive pathology. Two cohorts will be defined: the “pandemic” cohort, which will include all patients (classified as COVID-19-positive or -negative) operated on for emergency digestive pathology during the months of March to June 2020; and the “control” cohort, which will include all patients operated on for emergency digestive pathology during the months of March to June 2019. Information will be gathered on demographic characteristics, clinical and analytical parameters, scores on the usual prognostic scales for quality management in a General Surgery service (POSSUM, P-POSSUM and LUCENTUM scores), prognostic factors applicable to all patients, specific prognostic factors for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, postoperative morbidity and mortality (at 30 and 90 postoperative days).

In this study we established a mouse monoclonal antibody, 493D4, that recognizes 9-O-acetyl GT3 ganglioside, but not non-O-acetyl gangliosides. This antibody also reacted with 9-O-acetyl GD3 to a much lesser extent. By using this antibody, we found that O-acetyl GT3 as well as O-acetyl GD3 were expressed strongly in fetal murine cerebral cortex and decreased to an undetectable level after birth. With the assistance of TLC-immunostaining using 493D4 together with Q-Sepharose column chromatography, O-acetyl gangliosides of bovine brain were purified and the structural analysis showed the presence of O-acetyl GD3, O-acetyl LD1, O-acetyl GD2 and O-acetyl GD1b in the adult brain as extremely minor components. Interestingly, the antibody 493D4 could detect O-acetyl sialoglycoproteins in rat brain tissues.

Concern exists that possible disruptions in HIV programs due to COVID-19 could result in more HIV-related mortality and new HIV infections. This study aimed to investigate the real-time burden of COVID-19 on HIV patients attending antiretroviral therapy. METHODS: We conducted a facility-based, multicentre, cross-sectional study among HIV patients attending antiretroviral therapy in 10 healthcare facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in the COVID-19 pandemic period. Data was collected using adapted, interviewer-based questionnaires, and entered into Epi Info version 7 and exported to SPSS version 26 for analysis. RESULT: A total of 212 patients with HIV were included. Participants who missed visits for refill were 58 (27.4%). When the effects of other independent variables on appointments/visits for refill were controlled, the following characteristics were found to be the most important pridictors of missed appointments (P < 0.05): age ≥ 55 [AOR = 6.73, 95% CI (1.495–30.310)], fear of COVID-19 [AOR = 24.93, 95% CI (2.798-222.279)], transport disruption [AOR = 4.90, 95% CI (1.031–23.174)], reduced income for traveling to health facility [AOR = 5.64, 95% CI (1.234–25.812)], and limited access to mask [AOR = 7.67, 95% CI (1.303–45.174)], sanitizer [AOR = 0.07, 95% CI (0.007–0.729)] and non-medical support [AOR = 2.32, 95% CI (1.547–12.596)]. The participants were well aware of the COVID-19 preventive measures. The most costly COVID-19 preventive measures that cause financial burden to the patients were costs for buying facemasks (63.7%), disinfectants (55.2) and sops for handwashing (22.2). Participants who missed follow-up diagnostic tests were 56 (26.4%). Variables which were found to be statistically significant include the following: age ≥ 55 [AOR = 0.22, 95% CI (0.076–0.621)], partial lockdown [AOR = 0.10, 95% CI (0.011–0.833)], limited access to health services [AOR = 0.15, 95% CI (0.045–0.475)], reduced income for traveling to health facility [AOR = 0.18, 95% CI (0.039–0.784)], and unable to get mask [AOR = 0.12, 95% CI (0.026–0.543)]. Participants who missed counseling services were 55 (25.9%). In multivariate logistic regression the following were statisticaly significant: age ≥ 55 [AOR = 0.21, 95% CI (0.078–0.570)], fear of COVID-19 [AOR = 0.11, 95% CI (0.013–0.912)], reduced income [AOR = 0.17, 95% CI (0.041–0.699)], unable to get face mask [AOR = 0.19, 95%CI (0.039–0.959)], and partial lockdown [AOR = 0.08, 95% CI (0.008–0.790)]. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 had a significant burden on HIV patients to attend their routine clinical care and treatment, which may lead to treatment failure and drug resistance. The impact was on their appointments for medication refills and clinical and laboratory follow-ups. Targeted initiatives are needed to sustain HIV clinical care and treatment services and improve the wellbeing of people living with HIV.","Chilot, Dagmawi; Woldeamanuel, Yimtubezinash; Manyazewal, Tsegahun",Res Sq,555,24

METHODS: We conducted an e-survey using a cloud-based website to gauge the potential sources of trustworthy information and misinformation and analyzed researchers', clinicians', and academics' attitude toward unpublished items, and pre- and post-publication quality checks in this challenging time. RESULTS: Among 128 respondents (mean age, 43.2 years; M:F, 1.1:1), 60 (46.9%) were scholarly journal editors and editorial board members. Social media channels were distinguished as the most important sources of information as well as misinformation (81 [63.3%] and 86 [67.2%]). Nearly two in five (62, 48.4%) respondents blamed reviewers, editors, and misinterpretation by readers as additional contributors alongside authors for misinformation. A higher risk of plagiarism was perceived by the majority (70, 58.6%), especially plagiarism of ideas (64.1%) followed by inappropriate paraphrasing (54.7%). Opinion was divided on the utility of preprints for changing practice and changing retraction rates during the pandemic period, and higher rejections were not supported by most (76.6%) while the importance of peer review was agreed upon by a majority (80, 62.5%). More stringent screening by journal editors (61.7%), and facilitating open access plagiarism software (59.4%), including Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms (43.8%) were among the suggested solutions. Most (74.2%) supported the need to launch a specialist bibliographic database for COVID-19, with information indexed (62.3%), available as open-access (82.8%), after expanding search terms (52.3%) and following due verification by academics (66.4%), and journal editors (52.3%). CONCLUSION: While identifying social media as a potential source of misinformation on COVID-19, and a perceived high risk of plagiarism, more stringent peer review and skilled post-publication promotion are advisable. Journal editors should play a more active role in streamlining publication and promotion of trustworthy information on COVID-19.","Gupta, Latika; Gasparyan, Armen Yuri; Misra, Durga Prasanna; Agarwal, Vikas; Zimba, Olena; Yessirkepov, Marlen",J Korean Med Sci,555,22

One of the most basic skills that they acquire is reading. However, some children struggle with reading longer than their friends, and in such a case, it is possible that they have a learning disorder known as dyslexia. The paper aims to use neural networks, namely generative neural networks, for generating raw audio data of two- or three-letter Hindi words. Using the generated data, a system will be built that will pronounce generated words for children recuperating from dyslexia. The system aims to be an effective helping tool for teachers to speed up the recuperation process by making the child repeat the correct pronunciation of the word. The system uses advance Mel-generative adversarial network neural network for working with Mel-spectrograms of the raw audio, by which the system will model its own audio iteratively, until a satisfactory result is achieved. Generated audio sample contains the Hindi words which will be taught to children. Mel-generative adversarial network will be used to generate audio samples since it provides better results compared to other existing models. 300 basic two- or three-letter Hindi words are taken as an input for assisting 5- to 8-year children.

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disease characterized by platelet damage, life-threatening thrombocytopenia, and haemorrhage when the platelet count reaches below 20 × 10(9)/mcL. Its pathogenesis involves viral mimicry or T-cell-induced immune destruction in antibody-negative cases. The clinical manifestations of thrombocytopenia vary according to the severity (level of platelets) and range from being asymptomatic to severe haemorrhage. ITP is treated with immunosuppression. Case Presentation. A 26-year-old Iraqi male laboratory analyst with an unremarkable medical history presented with severe thrombocytopenia 2 days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus disease-2019 vaccine. The patient was asymptomatic with unremarkable examination findings. However, his low platelet count was discovered accidentally, and the patient did not exhibit the resistance pattern of ITP and recovered successfully with regular immunosuppressant treatment. CONCLUSION: Patients with a history of thrombocytopenia can develop vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia earlier than the expected onset. Close monitoring, through regular complete blood counts, is highly recommended for patients with previous thrombocytopenia because the immune modulation process of the vaccine can worsen preexisting thrombocytopenia.","Razzaq, Azhar Kareem; Al-Jasim, Ameer",Case Rep Hematol,555,12

The aim of the study was to review autopsies from COVID-19 decedents to evaluate the spectrum of pathology and correlate the results with clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings. METHODS: A comprehensive and quantitative review from 40 postmortem examinations was performed. The microscopic patterns were categorized as follows: “major” when present in more than 50% of cases and “novel” if rarely or not previously described and unexpected clinically. RESULTS: Three major pulmonary patterns were identified: ALI in 29 (73%) of 40, intravascular fibrin or platelet-rich aggregates (IFPAs) in 36 (90%) of 40, and vascular congestion and hemangiomatosis-like change (VCHL) in 20 (50%) of 40. The absence of ALI (non-ALI) was novel and seen in 11 (27%) of 40. Compared with ALI decedents, those with non-ALI had a shorter hospitalization course (P = .02), chest radiographs with no or minimal consolidation (P = .01), and no pathologically confirmed cause of death (9/11). All non-ALI had VCHL and IFPAs, and clinically most had cardiac arrest. CONCLUSIONS: Two distinct pulmonary phenotypic patterns—ALI and non-ALI—were noted. Non-ALI represents a rarely described phenotype. The cause of death in non-ALI is most likely COVID-19 related but requires additional corroboration.","De Michele, Simona; Sun, Yu; Yilmaz, Mine M; Katsyv, Igor; Salvatore, Mary; Dzierba, Amy L; Marboe, Charles C; Brodie, Daniel; Patel, Nina M; Garcia, Christine K; Saqi, Anjali",Am J Clin Pathol,555,17

Herein, we report on single-stage and two-stage molecular diagnostic tests that can be carried out with simple or no instrumentation. Our single-stage amplification is reverse transcription-loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) with custom-designed primers targeting the ORF1ab and the N gene regions of the virus genome. Our new two-stage amplification, dubbed Penn-RAMP, comprises recombinase isothermal amplification (RT-RPA) as its first stage and LAMP as its second stage. We compared various sample preparation strategies aimed at deactivating the virus while preserving its RNA and tested contrived and patient samples, consisting of nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, and saliva. Amplicons were detected either in real time with fluorescent intercalating dye or after amplification with the intercalating colorimetric dye LCV, which is insensitive to sample’s PH. Our single RT-LAMP tests can be carried out instrumentation-free. To enable concurrent testing of multiple samples, we developed an inexpensive heat block that supports both the single-stage and two-stage amplification. Our RT-LAMP and Penn-RAMP assays have, respectively, analytical sensitivities of 50 and 5 virions/reaction. Both our single- and two-stage assays have successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 in patients with viral loads corresponding to the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) threshold cycle smaller than 32 while operating with minimally processed samples, without nucleic acid isolation. Penn-RAMP provides a 10-fold better sensitivity than RT-LAMP and does not need thermal cycling like PCR assays. All reagents are amenable to dry, refrigeration-free storage.

This foodborne illness, which reportedly most likely originated in a seafood market where wild animals are sold illegally, has transmitted among humans through close contact, across the world. The aim of this study is to explore health/risk perceptions of and attitudes toward healthy/risky food in the immediate context of food crisis. More specifically, by using the data collected from 1008 respondents in January 2020, the time when China was hit hard by the “Corona Virus Disease 2019” (COVID-19), this study investigates the overall and different generational respondents’ health/risk perceptions of and attitudes toward organic food and game meat. The results reveal that, firstly, based on their food health and risk perceptions of healthy and risky food, the respondents’ general attitudes are positive toward organic food but relatively negative toward game meat. Secondly, older generations have a more positive attitude and are more committed to organic food. Younger generations’ attitude toward game meat is more negative whereas older generations attach more importance to it because of its nutritional and medicinal values. In addition, this research also indicates that the COVID-19 crisis influences the respondents’ perceptions of and attitudes toward organic food and game meat consumption. However, the likelihood of its impact on older generations’ future change in diets is smaller, which implies that older generations’ food beliefs are more stable.","Xie, Xiaoru; Huang, Liman; Li, Jun (Justin); Zhu, Hong",Int J Environ Res Public Health,555,8

This investigation sought to characterize engagement in these behaviors in U.S. adults early during the pandemic and to build explanatory models of the psychological processes that drive them. METHODS: US adults were recruited through Qualtrics Research Panels (N = 324; 55% female; M(age) = 50.91, SD = 15.98) and completed 10 days of online reports of emotion, COVID-19 perceived susceptibility and worry, and recommended behaviors (social distancing, hand washing, etc.). Factor analysis revealed behaviors loaded on two factors suggesting distinct motivational orientations: approach and avoidance. RESULTS: Changes in approach and avoidance behaviors over the 10 days indicated large individual differences consistent with three types of participants. Discrete emotions, including fear, guilt/shame, and happiness were associated with more recommended behaviors. Fear and COVID-19 worry indirectly influenced each other to facilitate more behavioral engagement. While emotions and worry strongly predicted individual differences in behavior across the 10 days, they did not predict as well why behaviors occurred on one day versus another. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest how daily affective processes motivate behavior, improving the understanding of compliance and efforts to target behaviors as primary prevention of disease.","Coifman, Karin G; Disabato, David J; Aurora, Pallavi; Seah, T H Stanley; Mitchell, Benjamin; Simonovic, Nicolle; Foust, Jeremy L; Sidney, Pooja Gupta; Thompson, Clarissa A; Taber, Jennifer M",Ann Behav Med,555,19

The WSC Index design as a quantitative framework based on qualitative rating descriptions and a participatory assessment methodology enables local contextual interpretations of the indicators, while maintaining a robust universal framework for city comparison and benchmarking. The paper demonstrates its application on three illustrative cases. Rapid uptake of the WSC Index in Australia highlights its value in helping stakeholders develop collective commitment and evidence-based priorities for action to accelerate their city's water sensitive transition. Early testing in cities in Asia and the Pacific has also showed the potential of the WSC Index internationally.","Rogers, B.C.; Dunn, G.; Novalia, W.; de Haan, F.J.; Brown, L.; Brown, R.R.; Hammer, K.; Lloyd, S.; Urich, C.; Wong, T.H.F.; Chesterfield, C.",Water Res X,555,12

Here, we used a mathematical model to compare five age-stratified prioritization strategies. A highly effective transmission-blocking vaccine prioritized to adults ages 20–49 years minimized cumulative incidence, but mortality and years of life lost were minimized in most scenarios when the vaccine was prioritized to adults over 60 years old. Use of individual-level serological tests to redirect doses to seronegative individuals improved the marginal impact of each dose while partially addressing existing inequities in COVID-19 impact. While maximum impact prioritization strategies were broadly consistent across countries, transmission rates, vaccination rollout speeds, and estimates of naturally acquired immunity, this framework can be used to compare impacts of prioritization strategies across contexts.","Bubar, Kate M.; Reinholt, Kyle; Kissler, Stephen M.; Lipsitch, Marc; Cobey, Sarah; Grad, Yonatan H.; Larremore, Daniel B.",medRxiv,555,24

Pig farmers are key stakeholders to support the international agenda pushing AMU restrictions. We interviewed 58 pig farmers on AMU/AMR, biosecurity, veterinary assistance, disease prevention and treatment, aiming to understand practices and attitudes towards the AMU/AMR problem. Farmers described a reliance on antibiotics to prevent and treat disease while neglecting biosecurity measures. We identified inappropriate AMU practices (high use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, incorrect dosage or treatment length) and unrestricted access to antibiotics, which encouraged imprudent AMU. Nevertheless, most farmers considered this AMU legitimate to guarantee herd productivity and showed unpreparedness and resistance to changing AMU practices, perceiving limitations (economic, sanitary and inspection) more easily than alternatives to reduce AMU. Agro-industries and foreign markets were mentioned, and internal consumers dismissed as potential motivators for behavioral changes. Importantly, farmers’ economic, technical and social factors may limit their autonomy to change practices. We conclude that the observed distancing of pig farmers from the AMU/AMR problem limits the efficiency of policies aiming for a prudent AMU. Our study indicates a need for education, training and behavior change nudging that should include other stakeholders beyond farmers.","Albernaz-Gonçalves, Rita; Olmos, Gabriela; Hötzel, Maria José",Antibiotics (Basel),555,27

Although cattle farming is widespread in Turkey, there are few studies of BCoV. The aim of this study was to evaluate the current situation regarding BCoV in Turkey. This is the first study reporting the full-length nucleotide sequences of BCoV spike (S) genes in Turkey. Samples were collected from 119 cattle with clinical signs of respiratory (n = 78) or digestive tract (n = 41) infection on different farms located across widely separated provinces in Turkey. The samples were screened for BCoV using RT-nested PCR targeting the N gene, which identified BCoV in 35 samples (9 faeces and 26 nasal discharge). RT-PCR analysis of the S gene produced partial/full-length S gene sequences from 11 samples (8 faeces and 3 nasal discharge samples). A phylogenetic tree of the S gene sequences was made to analyze the genetic relationships among BCoVs from Turkey and other countries. The results showed that the local strains present in faeces and nasal discharge samples had many different amino acid changes. Some of these changes were shown in previous studies to be critical for tropism. This study provides new data on BCoV in Turkey that will be valuable in designing effective vaccine approaches and control strategies.

Aims/Objectives: The objective of this research was to (1) determine the effect of decreased LT activity on waitlist mortality in the United States and (2) assess if this effect was homogenous across the country. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis utilizing United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data assessing 3,600 liver transplants from January 1, 2020 to June 2, 2020. COVID-19 incidence data was taken directly from the New York Times case count. Results: During weeks 10 to 15 of 2020, there was a 38% reduction in the number of LTs performed nationally, which was temporally associated with a transient 97% increase in waitlist mortality. When stratified by UNOS region, waitlist mortality was inversely correlated with the number of LTs performed in all 11 regions. However, the range of the association strength (r) was large (Pearson correlation coefficient range: −0.73 to −0.01). Conclusion: Interruptions in LT activity due to COVID-19 were associated with rapid increases in waitlist mortality, and these effects were unevenly distributed among candidates across the United States. The transplant community can utilize these results to mitigate inequalities in transplant allocation between UNOS regions and advocate for the uninterrupted practice of LT should another pandemic surge or COVID-19 variant arise.","Yuan, Qing; Haque, Omar; Coe, Taylor M.; Markmann, James F.",Front Surg,555,16

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in April 2020 in Canada. Individuals aged 16 or older who were of Chinese origin and living in Canada at the time of the survey were invited to participate in an online survey. Descriptive and univariate statistics were performed to describe participant attitudes towards various preventive and treatment measures for COVID-19. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify independent associations with sociodemographic factors and attitudes. RESULTS: A total of 754 eligible respondents were included in the analysis. 65.8% of the participants were female, 77.2% had a university degree or higher and 28.6% were 55 years of age or older. Overall, 48.8% of the study participants believed that TCM was effective in preventing COVID-19% and 46.2% would use TCM if they had COVID-19-related symptoms. However, the corresponding numbers for western medicine were 20.8% and 39.9%, which were statistically lower (p<0.01).

Its clinical expression is pleiomorphic and severity is related to age and comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. The pathophysiology of the disease relies on aberrant activation of immune system and lymphopenia that has been recognized as a prognosis marker. We wondered if the myeloid compartment was affected in Covid-19 and if monocytes and macrophages could be infected by SARS-CoV-2. We show here that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infects monocytes and macrophages without any cytopathic effect. Infection was associated with the secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, TGF-β) and the induction of a macrophagic specific transcriptional program characterized by the upregulation of M2-type molecules. In addition, we found that in vitro macrophage polarization did not account for the permissivity to SARS-CoV-2, since M1-and M2-type macrophages were similarly infected. Finally, in a cohort of 76 Covid-19 patients ranging from mild to severe clinical expression, all circulating monocyte subsets were decreased, likely related to massive emigration into tissues. Monocytes from Covid-19 patients exhibited decreased expression of HLA-DR and increased expression of CD163, irrespective of the clinical status. Hence, SARS-CoV-2 drives circulating monocytes and macrophages inducing immunoparalysis of the host for the benefit of Covid-19 disease progression.","Boumaza, Asma; Gay, Laetitia; Mezouar, Soraya; Diallo, Aïssatou Bailo; Michel, Moise; Desnues, Benoit; Raoult, Didier; Scola, Bernard La; Halfon, Philippe; Vitte, Joana; Olive, Daniel; Mege, Jean-Louis",bioRxiv,555,20

DESIGN: Simulations of provisional mortality data. SETTING: US and 16 other high income countries in 2010-18 and 2020, by sex, including an analysis of US outcomes by race and ethnicity. POPULATION: Data for the US and for 16 other high income countries from the National Center for Health Statistics and the Human Mortality Database, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy at birth, and at ages 25 and 65, by sex, and, in the US only, by race and ethnicity. Analysis excluded 2019 because life table data were not available for many peer countries. Life expectancy in 2020 was estimated by simulating life tables from estimated age specific mortality rates in 2020 and allowing for 10% random error. Estimates for 2020 are reported as medians with fifth and 95th centiles. RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2018, the gap in life expectancy between the US and the peer country average increased from 1.88 years (78.66 v 80.54 years, respectively) to 3.05 years (78.74 v 81.78 years). Between 2018 and 2020, life expectancy in the US decreased by 1.87 years (to 76.87 years), 8.5 times the average decrease in peer countries (0.22 years), widening the gap to 4.69 years. Life expectancy in the US decreased disproportionately among racial and ethnic minority groups between 2018 and 2020, declining by 3.88, 3.25, and 1.36 years in Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White populations, respectively. In Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black populations, reductions in life expectancy were 18 and 15 times the average in peer countries, respectively. Progress since 2010 in reducing the gap in life expectancy in the US between Black and White people was erased in 2018-20; life expectancy in Black men reached its lowest level since 1998 (67.73 years), and the longstanding Hispanic life expectancy advantage almost disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: The US had a much larger decrease in life expectancy between 2018 and 2020 than other high income nations, with pronounced losses among the Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black populations. A longstanding and widening US health disadvantage, high death rates in 2020, and continued inequitable effects on racial and ethnic minority groups are likely the products of longstanding policy choices and systemic racism.","Woolf, Steven H; Masters, Ryan K; Aron, Laudan Y",BMJ,555,21

A potential risk for mass vaccination ?,11.7056055,10.925124,2021-08-09,"Abstract Conventionally the efficiency of an adjuvant is measured by the capacity to induce enhanced antibody serum titres and cell mediated immunity (CMI) to a given antigen. Nowadays the capacity of an adjuvant is also measured by the quality as well as the magnitude of the induced immune response, guided by the protective immune response required. Quality includes isotype and IgG subclass responses, T-helper cell responses characterized by the cytokine profile and cytotoxic T cells (CTL). In the early phase of immunization some adjuvants influence the antigen administration and uptake by a so- called depot effect exemplified by aluminium hydroxide gel and oil adjuvants, which possibly is not as desired as alledged. A modern depot is exerted by slow release formulations continuously releasing the antigen over a period of time or by pulses at intervals aiming at ‘single injection’ vaccine. Great efforts are made to formulate efficient delivery formulations targeting the antigens from the site of administration, to draining lymph nodes or distant lymphatic tissue or to mucosal surfaces by parenteral or mucosal administrations. Nowadays, non-replicating carriers besides replicating vaccines are formulated to induce mucosal immune responses encompassing secretory IgA and CMI. Efforts to evoke immune responses on mucosal membranes distant from the site of administration have resulted mostly in little success. For a long time it was considered that CTL under the restriction of MHC Class I only could be evoked by replicating viruses or intracellular parasites. However, novel adjuvant delivery systems readily induce CTL by delivering the antigen to the APC resulting in intracellular transport to the cytosol for the MHC Class I presentation system, as well as to the endosomal pathway for the MHC Class II presentation.","Morein, Bror; Villacrés-Eriksson, María; Sjölander, Anders; Lövgren Bengtsson, Karin",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,555,16

One thousand and eighty-two participants from Spain, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador took part in this study. Irrespective of the country, and controlling for income level, young people, especially females, suffered a greater level of stress, perceived the situation as more severe, showed less adherence to health guidelines, and reported lower levels of health consciousness, in comparison to their male peers and older groups. However, in the case of self-care, it seems that older and female groups are generally more involved in self-care activities and adopt more healthy daily routines. These results are mostly similar between Colombia, Ecuador, and Spain. However, Chile showed some different tendencies, as males reported higher levels of healthy daily routines and better adherence to health guidelines compared to females and people over the age of 60. Differences between countries, genders, and age ranges should be considered in order to improve health recommendations and adherence to guidelines. Moreover, developing community action and intersectoral strategies with a gender-based approach could help to reduce health inequalities and increase the success of people’s adherence to health guidelines and self-care-promoting interventions.

In the current study, we aimed to examine the flow and content of tweets, exploring the role of COVID-19 key events on the popular Twitter platform. METHODS: Using representative freely available data, we performed a focused, social media-based analysis to capture COVID-19 discussions on Twitter, considering sentiment and longitudinal trends between January 19 and March 3, 2020. Different populations of users were considered. Core discussions were explored measuring tweets’ sentiment, by both computing a polarity compound score with 95% Confidence Interval and using a transformer-based model, pretrained on a large corpus of COVID-19-related Tweets. Context-dependent meaning and emotion-specific features were considered. RESULTS: We gathered 3,308,476 tweets written in English. Since the first World Health Organization report (January 21), negative sentiment proportion of tweets gradually increased as expected, with amplifications following key events. Sentiment scores were increasingly negative among most active users. Tweets content and flow revealed an ongoing scenario in which the global emergency seems difficult to be emotionally managed, as shown by sentiment trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating social media like Twitter as essential surveillance tools in the management of the pandemic and its waves might actually represent a novel preventive approach to hinder emotional contagion, disseminating reliable information and nurturing trust. There is the need to monitor and sustain healthy behaviors as well as community supports also via social media-based preventive interventions.","Crocamo, Cristina; Viviani, Marco; Famiglini, Lorenzo; Bartoli, Francesco; Pasi, Gabriella; Carrà, Giuseppe",Eur Psychiatry,555,33

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a decline in admissions with cardiovascular (CV) emergencies. The fatal consequences of this are unknown. Objectives - To describe the place and causes of acute CV death during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design - Retrospective nationwide cohort. Setting - England and Wales. Participants - All adult (age [≥]18 years) acute CV deaths (n=580,972) between 1st January 2014 and 2nd June 2020. Exposure - The COVID-19 pandemic (defined as from the onset of the first COVID-19 death in England on 2nd March 2020). Main outcomes - Place (hospital, care home, home) and acute CV events directly contributing to death as stated on the first part of the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death. Results - After 2nd March 2020, there were 22,820 acute CV deaths of which 5.7% related to COVID-19, and an excess acute CV mortality of 1752 (+8%) compared with the expected daily deaths in the same period. Deaths in the community accounted for nearly half of all deaths during this period. Care homes had the greatest increase in excess acute CV deaths (1065, +40%), followed by deaths at home (1728, +34%) and in hospital (57, +0%). The most frequent cause of acute CV death during this period was stroke (8,290, 36.3%), followed by acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (5,532, 24.2%), heart failure (5,280, 23.1%), pulmonary embolism (2,067, 9.1%) and cardiac arrest (1,037, 4.5%). Deep vein thrombosis had the greatest increase in cause of excess acute CV death (18, +25%), followed pulmonary embolism (340, +19%) and stroke (782, +10%). The greatest cause of excess CV death in care homes was stroke (700, +48%), compared with cardiac arrest (80, +56%) at home, and pulmonary embolism (126, +14%) and cardiogenic shock (41, +14%) in hospital. Conclusions and relevance - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an inflation in acute CV deaths above that expected for the time of year, nearly half of which occurred in the community. The most common cause of acute CV death was stroke followed by acute coronary syndrome and heart failure.

The initiative focused on demographic groups and geographic areas that were underrepresented in testing by clinical providers and had experienced high COVID-19 incidence, including Hispanic persons and those who have been economically marginalized. To assess the CBT initiative, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) compared demographic characteristics, economic marginalization, and test positivity between persons tested at CBT sites and persons tested in all other testing settings in Chicago. During May 13-November 14, a total of 253,904 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were conducted at CBT sites. Compared with those tested in all other testing settings in Chicago, persons tested at CBT sites were more likely to live in areas that are economically marginalized (38.6% versus 32.0%; p<0.001) and to be Hispanic (50.9% versus 20.7%; p<0.001). The cumulative percentage of positive test results at the CBT sites was higher than that at all other testing settings (11.1% versus 7.1%; p<0.001).

Emerging data suggests that “essential” workers, who are disproportionately more likely to be racial/ethnic minorities and immigrants, bear a disproportionate degree of risk. We used publicly available data to build a series of spatial autoregressive models assessing county level associations between COVID-19 mortality and (1) percentage of individuals engaged in farm work, (2) percentage of households without a fluent, adult English-speaker, (3) percentage of uninsured individuals under the age of 65, and (4) percentage of individuals living at or below the federal poverty line. We further adjusted these models for total population, population density, and number of days since the first reported case in a given county. We found that across all counties that had reported a case of COVID-19 as of July 12, 2020 (n = 3024), a higher percentage of farmworkers, a higher percentage of residents living in poverty, higher density, higher population, and a higher percentage of residents over the age of 65 were all independently and significantly associated with a higher number of deaths in a county. In urban counties (n = 115), a higher percentage of farmworkers, higher density, and larger population were all associated with a higher number of deaths, while lower rates of insurance coverage in a county was independently associated with fewer deaths. In non-urban counties (n = 2909), these same patterns held true, with higher percentages of residents living in poverty and senior residents also significantly associated with more deaths. Taken together, our findings suggest that farm workers may face unique risks of contracting and dying from COVID-19, and that these risks are independent of poverty, insurance, or linguistic accessibility of COVID-19 health campaigns.","Fielding-Miller, Rebecca K.; Sundaram, Maria E.; Brouwer, Kimberly",PLoS One,555,23

We assessed immunogenicity to a first mRNA- or vector-based SARS-CoV-2-vaccination dose in dialysis patients. METHODS: In a multicenter observational pilot study, 2 weeks after a first vaccination (BNT162b2/Pfizer-BioNTech [Comirnaty] or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/Oxford-Astra-Zeneca [Vaxzevria]), hemodialysis patients (N = 23), peritoneal dialysis patients (N = 4) and healthy staff (N = 14) were tested for SARS-CoV-2-spike IgG/IgM, Nucleocapsid-protein-IgG-antibodies and plasma ACE2-receptor-binding-inhibition capacity. Hemodialysis patients who had had prior COVID-19 infection (N = 18) served as controls. Both response to first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and IgG spike-positivity following prior COVID-19 infection were defined as SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG levels ≥ 50 AU/mL. RESULTS: Vaccination responder rates were 17.4% (4/23) in hemodialysis patients, 100% (4/4) in peritoneal dialysis patients and 57.1% (8/14) in staff (HD vs. PD: p = 0.004, HD vs. staff: p = 0.027). Among hemodialysis patients, type of vaccine (Comirnaty N = 11, Vaxzevria N = 12, 2 responders each) did not appear to influence antibody levels (IgG spike: Comirnaty median 0.0 [1.–3. quartile 0.0–3.8] versus Vaxzevria 4.3 [1.6–20.1] AU/mL, p = 0.079). Of responders to the first dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among hemodialysis patients (N = 4/23), median IgG spike levels and ACE2-receptor-binding-inhibition capacity were lower than that of IgG spike-positive hemodialysis patients with prior COVID-19 infection (13/18, 72.2%): IgG spike: median 222.0, 1.–3. quartile 104.1–721.9 versus median 3794.6, 1.–3. quartile 793.4–9357.9 AU/mL, p = 0.015; ACE2-receptor-binding-inhibition capacity: median 11.5%, 1.–3. quartile 5.0–27.3 versus median 74.8%, 1.–3. quartile 44.9–98.1, p = 0.002. CONCLUSIONS: Two weeks after their first mRNA- or vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, hemodialysis patients demonstrated lower antibody-related response than peritoneal dialysis patients and healthy staff or unvaccinated hemodialysis patients following prior COVID-19 infection.

After a prolonged period of little to no transmission, there was an outbreak of unknown source in July, 2020, in the Da Nang region, but the outbreak was quickly suppressed. We aimed to use epidemiological, behavioural, demographic, and policy data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang to calibrate an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission for Vietnam, and to estimate the risk of future outbreaks associated with reopening of international borders in the country. METHODS: For this modelling study, we used comprehensive data from June 15 to Oct 15, 2020, on testing, COVID-19 cases, and quarantine breaches within an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to model a COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang in July, 2020. We applied this model to quantify the risk of future outbreaks in Vietnam in the 3 months after the reopening of international borders, under different behavioural scenarios, policy responses (ie, closure of workplaces and schools), and ongoing testing. FINDINGS: We estimated that the outbreak in Da Nang between July and August, 2020, resulted in substantial community transmission, and that higher levels of symptomatic testing could have mitigated this transmission. We estimated that the outbreak peaked on Aug 2, 2020, with an estimated 1060 active infections (95% projection interval 890–1280). If the population of Vietnam remains highly compliant with mask-wearing policies, our projections indicate that the epidemic would remain under control even if a small but steady flow of imported infections escaped quarantine into the community. However, if complacency increases and testing rates are relatively low (10% of symptomatic individuals are tested), the epidemic could rebound again, resulting in an estimated 2100 infections (95% projected interval 1050–3610) in 3 months. These outcomes could be mitigated if the behaviour of the general population responds dynamically to increases in locally acquired cases that exceed specific thresholds, but only if testing of symptomatic individuals is also increased. INTERPRETATION: The successful response to COVID-19 in Vietnam could be improved even further with higher levels of symptomatic testing. If the previous approaches are used in response to new COVID-19 outbreaks, epidemic control is possible even in the presence of low levels of imported cases.

NVX-CoV2373 is a recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 rS) nanoparticle vaccine containing trimeric full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and Matrix-M adjuvant. Methods: A phase 3, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in adults 18-84 years old who received two intramuscular 5-mcg doses, 21 days apart, of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo (1:1) across 33 sites in the United Kingdom. The primary efficacy endpoint was virologically confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 with onset 7 days after second vaccination in serologically negative participants. Results: A total of 15,187 participants were randomized, of whom 7569 received NVX-CoV2373 and 7570 received placebo; 27.2% were 65 years or older, 44.7% had comorbidities and 4.2% had baseline serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2. There were 10 cases of Covid-19 among NVX-CoV2373 recipients and 96 cases among placebo recipients, with symptom onset at least 7 days after second vaccination; NVX-CoV2373 was 89.7% (95% confidence interval, 80.2 to 94.6) effective in preventing Covid-19, with no hospitalizations or deaths reported. There were five cases of severe Covid-19, all in the placebo group. Post hoc analysis revealed efficacies of 96.4% (73.8 to 99.5) and 86.3% (71.3 to 93.5) against the prototype strain and B.1.1.7 variant, respectively. Vaccine efficacy was similar across subgroups, including participants with comorbidities and those [≥]65 years old. Reactogenicity was generally mild and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and similar in the two groups. Conclusion: A two-dose regimen of NVX-CoV2373 conferred 89.7% protection against a blend of prototype and variant Covid-19, demonstrated high efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant, and had a reassuring safety profile.","Toback, S.; Heath, P.

As the effectiveness of PPIs in this region remains unclear, a systematic review focusing on this area of research can offer a valuable contribution. Here, we present a protocol for the first systematic review that aims to examine the effects of PPIs on increasing well-being, quality of life and resilience and decreasing depression, anxiety and stress for both health and clinical, child and adult populations in Arab countries. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol is carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols guidelines. A systematic literature search for studies up to 30 April 2021 will be conducted in the following electronic databases: PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Dar Al Mandumah and Al Manhal. Experimental/quasi-experimental quantitative studies evaluating the effects of PPIs on healthy and clinical participants of all ages in the 22 Arab countries will be included. Outcomes will include psychological effects of PPIs on dimensions related to well-being (eg, happiness), quality of life, resilience, depression, anxiety and stress. The risk of bias will be evaluated using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A narrative synthesis with tables of study characteristics will be provided. A meta-analysis will be included if outcomes allow; in this instance, subgroups analysis will be conducted, depending on the data gathered, to examine differences in effect sizes based on age group, population type, duration of intervention and type of intervention. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was not required for the performance of this systematic review. We intend to publish the study in a peer-reviewed journal and share the findings at relevant conferences.

There are limited data on disease activity after discontinuation and dose reduction. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects on inflammatory disease activity after discontinuation or dose reduction of rituximab in patients with RRMS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we included all RRMS and CIS patients ever treated with rituximab at the University Hospital of Umeå who had either; (1) discontinued treatment at any time or (2) reduced the dose to a mean of < 1000 mg yearly. The patients served as their own controls by contributing patient years on full dose, reduced dose, and off treatment. RESULTS: A total of 225 patients treated with mean (SD) 6256 (2456) mg rituximab during mean (SD) 6.5 (2.0) years were included. There were no differences regarding the annualized relapse rates during full dose versus reduced dose or off treatment (0.02 versus < 0.01 and 0.02, p = 0.09), neither regarding proportion MRI scans with new or enlarged T2 lesions (0.03 versus 0.01 and 0.03, p = 0.37) or contrast-enhancing lesions (< 0.01 versus 0 and 0.02, p = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that rituximab has long-term effects on inflammatory disease activity and that disease reactivation is rare in MS patients who discontinued treatment for any reason. It also suggests that treatment with low-dose rituximab (< 1000 mg yearly) is sufficient to maintain suppression of inflammatory disease activity in patients with stable disease.","Boremalm, Malin; Sundström, Peter; Salzer, Jonatan",J Neurol,555,30

Since their discovery, bacteriophages have been considered an important weapon to fight human and animal infections of bacterial origin due to their specific ability to attack the associated target bacteria. With the discovery of antibiotics, phage treatment was progressively abandoned in Western countries. However, due to the recent emergence of growing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to antibiotics, interest in phage use in human therapy has once again grown. Similarly, at the environmental level, the extensive use of disinfectants based on chemicals, including biocides in agriculture, has been associated with the emergence of resistance against disinfectants themselves, besides having a high environmental impact. Due to these issues, the applications of phages with biocontrol purposes have become an interesting option in several fields, including farms, food industry, agriculture, aquaculture and wastewater plants. Notably, phage action is maintained even when the target bacteria are multidrug resistant (MDR), rendering this option extremely interesting in counteracting AMR emergence both for therapeutical and decontamination purposes. Based on this, bacteriophages have been interestingly proposed as environmental routine sanitizers in hospitals, to counteract the spread of the pathogenic MDR bacteria that persistently contaminate hard surfaces. This review summarizes the studies aimed at evaluating the potential use of phages as decontaminants, with a special focus on hospital sanitation.","D’Accolti, Maria; Soffritti, Irene; Mazzacane, Sante; Caselli, Elisabetta",Microorganisms,555,23

OBJECTIVES: 1) To compare the impact of COVID-19 on the life experiences of essential workers attending a COVID-19 antibody testing clinic at a dental school. 2) To compare responses of dental, non–dental health care, and non–health care essential workers. 3) To assess acceptability/satisfaction of testing done in a dental setting. METHOD: A total of 984 participants completed a self-administered online questionnaire. RESULTS: Over 90% were healthy (i.e., not in a high-risk health-related group for COVID-19), did not have COVID-19 symptoms within 30 d, and always/frequently engaged in preventive measures. Fifty-eight percent thought that they had a 0% to 25% chance of having immunity/antibodies to COVID-19. Non–dental health care workers thought that their chance was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than others. Over 70% were sometimes, frequently, or always worried about their friends and loved ones getting COVID-19 and of resulting financial problems. Dental workers were significantly less afraid than non–dental health care and non–health care providers. For all groups, more than half of the respondents stated that the pandemic had a negative (somewhat worse or worse) impact on daily life (59%), interactions with others (65%), stress levels (66%), and enjoyment of life (56%). There were significant differences among all 3 groups regarding the percentage of individuals with a negative impact on job security (dental, 47%; non–dental health care, 34%; non–health care, 31%). However, more than half of the respondents stated that the pandemic had a positive impact (same, somewhat better, or much better) on caring about one another, self-care, and exercise. Knowing the results of an antibody test would decrease the level of stress and anxiety in 67% of respondents. Over 80% found a COVID-19 test received in a dental setting acceptable, were “definitely” satisfied, and would “definitely” recommend it to a friend, family, or coworker. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support that dental workers are as vulnerable as other essential workers to threats and psychological impacts of COVID-19. They also support the acceptability and satisfaction of testing for a pandemic done in a dental setting. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The results of this study highlight the impact that pandemics such as COVID-19 can have on life experiences of essential workers, including dentists. It also highlights a role that dentistry can play within the broader health care system, during and beyond the current pandemic, to help with surveillance efforts of community health. Testing may also help alleviate stress and anxiety associated with these pandemics.","Fontana, M.; McCauley, L.; Fitzgerald, M.; Eckert, G.J.; Yanca, E.; Eber, R.",JDR Clin Trans Res,555,26

Health and health care use has also been affected by pandemic-related loss of employer-based health insurance, food and housing disruptions, and heightened stress, sleep disruptions and social isolation. These disruptions are projected to contribute to excess non-COVID-19 deaths over the coming decades. At the same time municipalities, health systems and individuals are making changes in response to the pandemic, including modifications in the environmental to promote health, implementation of telehealth platforms, and shifts towards greater self-care and using remote platforms to maintain social connections. We used a multi-level biopsychosocial model to examine the available literature on the relationship between COVID-19-related changes and breast cancer prevention to identify current gaps in knowledge and identify potential opportunities for future research. We found that COVID-19 has impacted several aspects of social and economic life, through a variety of mechanisms, including unemployment, changes in health care delivery, changes in eating and activity, and changes in mental health. Some of these changes should be reduced, while others should be explored and enhanced.","Bowen, Deborah J.; Rentscher, Kelly E.; Wu, Amy; Darien, Gwen; Haile, Helen Ghirmai; Mandelblatt, Jeanne; Kavanaugh-Lynch, Marion",Int J Environ Res Public Health,555,28

We investigated the presence and the pathotype of these strains in several calf populations by colony hybridization or by genetic amplification. Using the colony hybridization method we showed first that only 5% of calves who died from diarrhea presented EaeA+ E. coli strains and secondly that 19% of healthy calves showed an asymptomatic carriage. However, using colony hybridization and genetic amplification, we identified EaeA+ strains in 91% of calves living in farms with recurrent diarrhea problems. In 66% of the calves, there was a correlation between the presence of AEEC and diarrhea. At the pathotype level, most of the EaeA+ isolates were negative for VT probes. In VT+ bacteria, the majority were VT1+. The number of VT positive bacteria was significantly higher in calves who died from diarrhea than in healthy or sick calves. This underlined the aggravating role of verotoxins in the disease. Moreover, only 25% of the bovine AEEC were positive with the EaeB probe.

Moreover, mathematical models have been developed that allow prediction of active cases following the temporal patterns of viral loads in wastewaters. In Mexico, no systematic efforts have been reported in the use of this strategies. In this work, we quantified SARS-CoV-2 in rivers and irrigation canals in the Mezquital Valley, Hidalgo, an agricultural region where wastewater from Mexico City is distributed and used for irrigation. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we detected the virus in 6 out of 8 water samples from rivers, and 5 out of 8 water samples from irrigation canals. Notably, samples showed a general consistent trend of having the highest viral loads in the sites closer to Mexico City, indicating that this is the main source that contributes to detection. Using the data for SARS-CoV-2 concentration in the river samples, we generated a simplified transport model that describes the spatial patterns of dispersion of virus in the river. We suggest that this model can be extrapolated to other wastewater systems that require knowledge of spatial patterns of viral dispersion at a geographic scale. Our work highlights the need for improved practices and policies related to the use of wastewater for irrigation in Mexico and other countries.","Coronado, Y.; Navarro, R.; Mosqueda, C.; Valenzuela, V.; Perez, J.

It is noteworthy that the associations between COVID-19 related experiences and typical mental symptoms among pregnant women remain unclear. A cross-sectional online survey among pregnant women was conducted in Shenzhen, China. Multivariable logistic regression models were applied to explore the associations of COVID-19 related experiences with anxiety and depression symptoms during pregnancy. Totally, 751 pregnant women were enrolled. Lower prevalence of anxiety and depression was observed among older individuals: 17.2%, 12.3%, and 6.7% for anxiety symptom; 40.0%, 35.3%, and 24.6% for depression symptom, respectively in age <30 years, 30 to 34 years, and &#8805;35 years groups. COVID-19 related experiences that associated with the anxiety and depression symptoms among pregnant women included having confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases around, subjective moderate or high risk of being infected, subjective severe life impact, subjective moderate or severe psychological impact, and spending more than one hour in COVID-19 related news. In the post-pandemic era, the psychological strain imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic is urgently needed to be alleviated among pregnant women.

Vaccines are extremely safe, however, no vaccine is completely free from risks and adverse events can occur following vaccination. An adverse event following immunization (AEFI) may be a true adverse reaction caused by the vaccine or an event that temporally occurred after immunization but is not caused by it. Among the adverse reactions to vaccines, one of the most feared is the triggering of autoimmune diseases, which are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by dysregulation of the immune system. Currently, no mechanisms have been demonstrated that could explain the correlation between vaccination and the development of autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, epidemiological studies do not support the hypothesis that vaccines cause systemic autoimmune diseases. The only confirmed associations, although very rare, are those between the flu vaccine and Guillain-Barré syndrome, especially with old vaccine preparations, and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and thrombocytopenia. Due to the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, new types of vaccines have been developed and are now available.

While SARS-CoV-2 infection causes predictable symptoms in COVID-19 patients, including upper respiratory distress and fever, the heterogeneity of manifestations is surprising. This review focuses on direct and indirect causes of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients and highlights current knowledge, treatment strategies, and outstanding questions in the field. RECENT FINDINGS: Data are emerging that highlight the extent of cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 patients, including evidence that SARS-CoV-2 causes myocarditis and increases cardiac risk. The incidence of cardiac injury is much greater in patients with severe disease presentation and those in intensive care. SUMMARY: During the past year, COVID-19 patient mortality rates have improved due to tailored pharmacological treatments and patient management strategies that address the unique presentation of symptoms, which will hopefully also reduce the incidence of cardiac injury.","Bugert, Christina L.; Kwiat, Victoria; Valera, Isela C.; Bugert, Joachim J.; Parvatiyar, Michelle S.",Curr Clin Microbiol Rep,555,1

No licensed specific drugs are available to prevent their infection. Different host receptors for cellular entry, poorly conserved structural proteins (antigens), and the high mutation and recombination rates of CoVs pose a significant problem in the development of wide-spectrum anti-CoV drugs and vaccines. CoV main proteases (M(pro)s), which are key enzymes in viral gene expression and replication, were revealed to share a highly conservative substrate-recognition pocket by comparison of four crystal structures and a homology model representing all three genetic clusters of the genus Coronavirus. This conclusion was further supported by enzyme activity assays. Mechanism-based irreversible inhibitors were designed, based on this conserved structural region, and a uniform inhibition mechanism was elucidated from the structures of M(pro)-inhibitor complexes from severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. A structure-assisted optimization program has yielded compounds with fast in vitro inactivation of multiple CoV M(pro)s, potent antiviral activity, and extremely low cellular toxicity in cell-based assays. Further modification could rapidly lead to the discovery of a single agent with clinical potential against existing and possible future emerging CoV-related diseases.","Yang, Haitao; Xie, Weiqing; Xue, Xiaoyu; Yang, Kailin; Ma, Jing; Liang, Wenxue; Zhao, Qi; Zhou, Zhe; Pei, Duanqing; Ziebuhr, John; Hilgenfeld, Rolf; Yuen, Kwok Yung; Wong, Luet; Gao, Guangxia; Chen, Saijuan; Chen, Zhu; Ma, Dawei; Bartlam, Mark; Rao, Zihe",PLoS Biol,555,26

Among the reasons for the expansion of these diseases and the appearance of new neuropathogens are globalization, global warming, and the increased proximity between humans and wild animals due to human activities such as deforestation. Neurotropism affecting normal brain function is shared by organisms such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Neuroinfections caused by these agents activate immune responses, inducing neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, and neurodegeneration. Purinergic signaling is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway associated with these neuropathologies. During neuroinfections, host cells release ATP as an extracellular danger signal with pro-inflammatory activities. ATP is metabolized to its derivatives by ectonucleotidases such as CD39 and CD73; ATP and its metabolites modulate neuronal and immune mechanisms through P1 and P2 purinergic receptors that are involved in pathophysiological mechanisms of neuroinfections. ﻿In this review we discuss the beneficial or deleterious effects of various components of the purinergic signaling pathway in infectious diseases that affect the CNS, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection, bacterial meningitis, sepsis, cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis, and malaria. We also provide a description of this signaling pathway in emerging viral infections with neurological implications such as Zika and SARS-CoV-2.","Alves, Vinícius Santos; Leite-Aguiar, Raíssa; da Silva, Joyce Pereira; Coutinho-Silva, Robson; Savio, Luiz Eduardo Baggio",Brain Behav Immun,555,3

Primary care is ideally situated to offer bereavement care, yet UK provision remains variable and practitioners feel uncertain how best to support bereaved patients. AIM: To identify what works, how, and for whom, in the management of complicated grief (CG) in primary care. DESIGN & SETTING: A review of evidence on the management of CG and bereavement in UK primary care settings. METHOD: A realist approach was taken that aims to provide causal explanations through the generation and articulation of contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes. RESULTS: Forty-two articles were included. Evidence on the primary care management of complicated or prolonged grief was limited. GPs and nurses view bereavement support as part of their role, yet experience uncertainty over the appropriate extent of their involvement. Patients and clinicians often have differing views on the role of primary care in bereavement. Training in bereavement, local systems for reporting deaths, practitioner time, and resources can assist or hinder bereavement care provision. Practitioners find bereavement care can be emotionally challenging. Understanding patients’ needs can encourage a proactive response and help identify appropriate support. CONCLUSION: Bereavement care in primary care remains variable and practitioners feel unprepared to provide appropriate bereavement care. Patients at higher risk of complicated or prolonged grief may fail to receive the support they need from primary care.

A total of 160 university students who learnt English as a foreign language (EFL) in four classes participated in the study and were exposed to one of the four conditions: (a) L2 definition only, (b) L2 definition coupled with audio, (c) L2 definition plus video, and (d) L2 definition with picture. Participants were asked to read eight hypermediated reading texts. Reading comprehension as well as vocabulary acquisition were measured using a pretest–posttest design. The results show first that all these four conditions led to students' vocabulary gains. More specifically, participants who had access to L2 definition plus picture and plus videos achieved significantly higher scores than the other two groups, L2 definition coupled with audio and L2 definition only. Concerning reading comprehension, all multimedia glossing presentation led to better reading comprehension, but no differences were found among all the glossing groups. The questionnaire and interview data indicate that students preferred L2 definition coupled with video and picture glosses, followed by audio and L2 definition only. The results reflect that multimedia glossing presentation creates a different effect on students' vocabulary acquisition and reading comprehension, respectively.

We here aimed to analyse the pulmonary immune response during severe COVID-19 and to compare this with blood responses. METHODS: This was an observational study in patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Mononuclear cells were purified from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and blood, and analysed by spectral flow cytometry; inflammatory mediators were measured in BALF and plasma. FINDINGS: Paired blood and BALF samples were obtained from 17 patients, four of whom died in the ICU. Macrophages and T cells were the most abundant cells in BALF, with a high percentage of T cells expressing the ƴδ T cell receptor. In the lungs, both CD4 and CD8 T cells were predominantly effector memory cells (87·3% and 83·8%, respectively), and these cells expressed higher levels of the exhaustion marker programmad death-1 than in peripheral blood. Prolonged ICU stay (>14 days) was associated with a reduced proportion of activated T cells in peripheral blood and even more so in BALF. T cell activation in blood, but not in BALF, was higher in fatal COVID-19 cases. Increased levels of inflammatory mediators were more pronounced in BALF than in plasma. INTERPRETATION: The bronchoalveolar immune response in COVID-19 has a unique local profile that strongly differs from the immune profile in peripheral blood.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study comprised 104 cases (mean age, 62 years ± 16, range 25-93) with COVID-19 confirmed with RT-PCR. CT images were reviewed and the CT severity score was calculated for each lobes and the entire lung. CT findings were compared between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. RESULTS: Of 104 cases, 76 (73%) were asymptomatic, 41 (54%) of which had lung opacities on CT. Other 28 (27%) cases were symptomatic, 22 (79%) of which had abnormal CT findings. Symptomatic cases showed lung opacities and airway abnormalities on CT more frequently than asymptomatic cases [lung opacity; 22 (79%) vs 41 (54%), airway abnormalities; 14 (50%) vs 15 (20%)]. Asymptomatic cases showed more GGO over consolidation (83%), while symptomatic cases more frequently showed consolidation over GGO (41%). The CT severity score was higher in symptomatic cases than asymptomatic cases, particularly in the lower lobes [symptomatic vs asymptomatic cases; right lower lobe: 2 ± 1 (0-4) vs 1 ± 1 (0-4); left lower lobe: 2 ± 1 (0-4) vs 1 ± 1 (0-3); total score: 7 ± 5 (1-17) vs 4 ± 2 (1-11)].

A broad spectrum of experimental and clinical studies showed that metformin has a pleiotropic activity and favorable effect in different pathological conditions, including prediabetes, type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Moreover, there are numerous studies, meta-analyses and population studies indicating that metformin is safe and well tolerated and may be associated with cardioprotective and nephroprotective effect. Recently, it has also been reported in some studies, but not all, that metformin, besides improvement of glucose homeostasis, may possibly reduce the risk of cancer development, inhibit the incidence of neurodegenerative disease and prolong the lifespan. This paper presents some arguments supporting the initiation of metformin in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM, especially those without cardiovascular risk factors or without established cardiovascular disease or advanced kidney insufficiency at the time of new guidelines favoring new drugs with pleotropic effects complimentary to glucose control. Moreover, it focuses on the potential beneficial effects of metformin in patients with T2DM and coexisting chronic diseases.","Drzewoski, Józef; Hanefeld, Markolf",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),555,26

To date, there is lack of studies describing clinical characteristics of the people at high risk of infection. Hence, we aimed (i) to identify clinical predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, (ii) to develop and validate a score predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, and (iii) to compare it with unspecific scores. METHODS: Retrospective case-control study using administrative health-related database was carried out in Southern Italy (Campania region) among beneficiaries of Regional Health Service aged over than 30 years. For each person with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection (case), up to five controls were randomly matched for gender, age and municipality of residence. Odds ratios and 90% confidence intervals for associations between candidate predictors and risk of infection were estimated by means of conditional logistic regression. SARS-CoV-2 Infection Score (SIS) was developed by generating a total aggregate score obtained from assignment of a weight at each selected covariate using coefficients estimated from the model. Finally, the score was categorized by assigning increasing values from 1 to 4. Discriminant power was used to compare SIS performance with that of other comorbidity scores. RESULTS: Subjects suffering from diabetes, anaemias, Parkinson’s disease, mental disorders, cardiovascular and inflammatory bowel and kidney diseases showed increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similar estimates were recorded for men and women and younger and older than 65 years. Fifteen conditions significantly contributed to the SIS. As SIS value increases, risk progressively increases, being odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people with the highest SIS value (SIS = 4) 1.74 times higher than those unaffected by any SIS contributing conditions (SIS = 1). CONCLUSION: Conditions and diseases making people more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified by the current study.

All these new viruses, as well as previously known respiratory viruses, can be detected by sensitive PCR methods, which have become popular in the diagnostic workup of respiratory viral infections. Currently, respiratory viruses can be detected in up to 95% of children with lower respiratory tract illness. On the other hand, virus detection rates in asymptomatic children are also high (up to 68%), as are coinfection rates in symptomatic children (up to 43%) and justified concerns of causality have been raised. Imposing progress has been made in developing multiplex quantitative PCR assays; here, several primer sets are run within a single PCR mixture. These PCR assays give a better understanding of the dominant viral infection, of viral infections that may be incipient and of any waning infections than does a single-target PCR. Multiplex PCR assays are also gaining popularity due to their cost-effectiveness and short throughput time compared to multiple single-target PCRs.

Cancer cells are known to induce increased CD47 expression. Similar to cancer cells, all immune cells can upregulate their CD47 surface expression during infection. The CD47-SIRPa interaction induces an inhibitory effect on macrophages and dendritic cells (dendritic cells) while CD47-thrombospondin-signaling inhibits T cells. Therefore, the disruption of the CD47 interaction can mediate several biologic functions. Upon the blockade and knockout of CD47 reveals an immunosuppressive effect of CD47 during LCMV, influenza virus, HIV-1, mycobacterium tuberculosis, plasmodium and other bacterial pneumonia infections. In our recent study we shows that the blockade of CD47 using the anti-CD47 antibody increases the activation and effector function of macrophages, dendritic cells and T cells during viral infection. By enhancing both innate and adaptive immunity, CD47 blocking antibody promotes antiviral effect. Due to its broad mode of action, the immune-stimulatory effect derived from this antibody could be applicable in nonresolving and (re)emerging infections. The anti-CD47 antibody is currently under clinical trial for the treatment of cancer and could also have amenable therapeutic potential against infectious diseases. This review highlights the immunotherapeutic targeted role of CD47 in the infectious disease realm.","Cham, Lamin B.; Adomati, Tom; Li, Fanghui; Ali, Murtaza; Lang, Karl S.",Antibodies (Basel),555,1

Declines in exercise capacity result in reduced physical activity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Self-management interventions can teach patients skills and behaviours to manage their disease. Technology-mediated interventions have the potential to provide easily accessible support for disease self-management. We evaluated the effectiveness of a web-based self-management intervention, focused on physical activity promotion, on exercise capacity in COPD. This 6-month randomised controlled trial (NCT02099799) enrolled 153 persons with COPD at two US sites (VABoston, n=108; VABirmingham, n=45). Participants were allocated (1:1) to the web-based self-management intervention (physical activity promotion through personalised, progressive step-count goals, feedback, online COPD-related education and social support via an online community) or usual care. The primary outcome was exercise capacity (6-min walk distance (6 MWD)). Secondary outcomes included physical activity (daily steps per day), HRQoL (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire Total Score), dyspnoea, COPD-related knowledge and social support. Change in step-count goals reflected intervention engagement. Participants' mean age was 69 (sd=7), and mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s % predicted was 61% (sd=21%). Change in 6MWD did not differ between groups. Intervention participants improved their mean daily step counts by 1312 more than those in the usual care group (p<0.001). Groups did not differ on other secondary outcomes. VABirmingham participants were significantly more engaged with the intervention, although site did not modify the effect of the intervention on 6MWD or secondary outcomes. The intervention did not improve exercise capacity but improved physical activity at 6 months. Additional intervention modifications are needed to optimise its COPD self-management capabilities.","Robinson, Stephanie A.; Cooper, J.

While restoration of microcapillaries is critical to avoid mortality, therapeutic targeting of this process requires a greater understanding of endothelial repair mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that lung endothelium possesses substantial regenerative capacity and lineage tracing reveals that native endothelium is the source of vascular repair after influenza injury. Ablation of chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter–transcription factor 2 (COUP-TF2) (Nr2f2), a transcription factor implicated in developmental angiogenesis, reduced endothelial proliferation, exacerbating viral lung injury in vivo. In vitro, COUP-TF2 regulates proliferation and migration through activation of cyclin D1 and neuropilin 1. Upon influenza injury, nuclear factor κB suppresses COUP-TF2, but surviving endothelial cells ultimately reestablish vascular homeostasis dependent on restoration of COUP-TF2. Therefore, stabilization of COUP-TF2 may represent a therapeutic strategy to enhance recovery from pathogens, including H1N1 influenza and SARS-CoV-2.","Zhao, Gan; Weiner, Aaron I.; Neupauer, Katherine M.; de Mello Costa, Maria Fernanda; Palashikar, Gargi; Adams-Tzivelekidis, Stephanie; Mangalmurti, Nilam S.; Vaughan, Andrew E.",Sci Adv,555,1

Prior to this study, no information was available concerning the incidence and prevalence of these viruses in Cape Verde archipelago. RESULTS: To provide information regarding the health status of the canine population in Vila do Maio, Maio Island, Cape Verde, 53 rectal swabs were collected from 53 stray dogs during 2010 and 93 rectal swabs and 88 blood samples were collected from 125 stray dogs in 2011. All rectal swabs (2010 n = 53; 2011 n = 93) were analysed for the presence of canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus and canine coronavirus nucleic acids by quantitative PCR methods. Specific antibodies against canine distemper virus and canine parvovirus were also assessed (2011 n = 88). From the 2010 sampling, 43.3% (23/53) were positive for canine parvovirus DNA, 11.3% (6/53) for canine distemper virus RNA and 1.9% (1/53) for canine coronavirus RNA. In 2011, the prevalence values for canine parvovirus and canine coronavirus were quite similar to those from the previous year, respectively 44.1% (41/93), and 1.1% (1/93), but canine distemper virus was not detected in any of the samples analysed (0%, 0/93). Antibodies against canine parvovirus were detected in 71.6% (63/88) blood samples and the seroprevalence found for canine distemper virus was 51.1% (45/88). CONCLUSIONS: This study discloses the data obtained in a molecular and serological epidemiological surveillance carried out in urban populations of stray and domestic animals. Virus transmission and spreading occurs easily in large dog populations leading to high mortality rates particularly in unvaccinated susceptible animals. In addition, these animals can act as disease reservoirs for wild animal populations by occasional contact. Identification of susceptible wildlife of Maio Island is of upmost importance to evaluate the risk of pathogen spill over from domestic to wild animals in Cape Verde and to evaluate the associated threat to the wild susceptible species.","Castanheira, Pedro; Duarte, Ana; Gil, Solange; Cartaxeiro, Clara; Malta, Manuel; Vieira, Sara; Tavares, Luis",BMC Vet Res,555,26

Oral fluid (OF) is an alternate clinical sample, easy and safer to collect and could be useful for COVID-19 diagnosis, monitoring viral load and shedding. Methods: Optimal assay conditions and analytical sensitivity were established for the commercial Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assay adapted to OF matrix. The assay was used to test 337 OF and NPS specimens collected in parallel from 164 hospitalized patients; 50 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from a subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases were also analysed. Results: Using Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct on OF matrix, 100% analytical detection down to 1 TCID50/mL (corresponding to 4 × 10(3) copies (cp)/mL) was observed. No crossreaction with other viruses transmitted through the respiratory toute was observed. Parallel testing of 337 OF and NPS samples showed highly concordant results (κ = 0.831; 95 % CI = 0.771–0.891), and high correlation of Ct values (r = 0.921; p < 0.0001). High concordance and elevated correlation was observed also between OF and BAL. Prolonged viral RNA shedding was observed up to 100 days from symptoms onset (DSO), with 32% and 29% positivity observed in OF and NPS samples, respectively, collected between 60 and 100 DSO. Conclusions: Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assays on OF have high sensitivity and specificity to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA and provide an alternative to NPS for diagnosis and monitoring SARS-CoV-2 shedding.","Bordi, Licia; Sberna, Giuseppe; Lalle, Eleonora; Piselli, Pierluca; Colavita, Francesca; Nicastri, Emanuele; Antinori, Andrea; Boumis, Evangelo; Petrosillo, Nicola; Marchioni, Luisa; Minnucci, Giulia; D’Agostini, Elena; Castilletti, Concetta; Locatelli, Franco; Zumla, Alimuddin; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria",Viruses,555,1

This is achieved via a SEIR model. Using an expected latent period of 4.5 days and infectious period of 3.8 days, [Formula: see text] was first estimated as 3.18 using observed death rates under unmitigated spread and then under the effects of the total lockdown ([Formula: see text] =0.60) of 23 March. The case fatality rate given infection is taken as 1%. Parameter values for mean length of stay and conditional probability of death for ICU and non-ICU hospital admissions are guided by Ferguson et al. (2020). Under unmitigated spread the model predicts around 600,000 deaths in the UK. Starting with one exposed person at time zero and a suppression consistent with an [Formula: see text] of 0.60 on day 72, the model predicts around 39,000 deaths for a first wave, but this reduces to around 11,000 if the intervention takes place one week earlier. If the initial suppression were in place until day 200 and then relaxed to an [Formula: see text] of 1.5 between days 200 and 300, to be followed by a return to an [Formula: see text] of 0.60, the model predicts around 43,000 deaths. This would increase to around 64,000 if the release from the first suppression takes place 20 days earlier.

SARS-CoV-2 targets epithelial cells in the respiratory tract and lungs, which can lead to amplified chloride secretion and increased leak across epithelial barriers, contributing to severe pneumonia and consolidation of the lungs as seen in many COVID-19 patients. There is an urgent need for a better understanding of the molecular aspects that contribute to SARS-CoV-2 induced pathogenesis and for the development of approaches to mitigate these damaging pathologies. The multifunctional SARS-CoV-2 Envelope (E) protein contributes to virus assembly/egress, and as a membrane protein, also possesses viroporin channel properties that may contribute to epithelial barrier damage, pathogenesis, and disease severity. The extreme C-terminal (ECT) sequence of E also contains a putative PDZ-domain binding motif (PBM), similar to that identified in the E protein of SARS-CoV-1. Here, we screened an array of GST-PDZ domain fusion proteins using either a biotin-labeled WT or mutant ECT peptide from the SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Notably, we identified a singular specific interaction between the WT E peptide and the second PDZ domain of human Zona Occludens-1 (ZO1), one of the key regulators of TJ formation/integrity in all epithelial tissues. We used homogenous time resolve fluorescence (HTRF) as a second complementary approach to further validate this novel modular E-ZO1 interaction. We postulate that SARS-CoV-2 E interacts with ZO1 in infected epithelial cells, and this interaction may contribute, in part, to tight junction damage and epithelial barrier compromise in these cell layers leading to enhanced virus spread and severe respiratory dysfunction that leads to morbidity. Prophylactic/therapeutic intervention targeting this virus-host interaction may effectively reduce airway barrier damage and mitigate virus spread.","Shepley-McTaggart, Ariel; Sagum, Cari A.; Oliva, Isabela; Rybakovsky, Elizabeth; DiGuilio, Katie; Liang, Jingjing; Bedford, Mark T.; Cassel, Joel; Sudol, Marius; Mullin, James M.; Harty, Ronald N.",bioRxiv,555,26

The ‘ideal solution’— professional translation— is high-priced, mainly because of issues associated with ongoing cost burden, administrative/legal implications, and the challenge of finding available translators for every unique language pairs. Citizen translation can potentially help to break down the communication barriers between emergency authorities and people from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) background. However, emergency authorities in many countries are still sceptical about relying on non-professional citizen translators to engender emergency messaging in multiple languages. This paper presents new findings from an Australian case study to further establish the evidence base required to support a successful implementation of citizen translation. This qualitative research contributes by investigating how members of CALD communities respond to the messages or warnings issued by emergency authorities, including the implications that the observed responses have for implementing citizen translation of emergency messages. A distinct form of citizen translation, known as the Collaborative Translation of Emergency Messages (Co-TEM), is proposed along with its underlying principles for specifically delivering the translation of official warnings or emergency messages. The study reports on key findings from Co-TEM that could further strengthen or extend existing knowledge in citizen translation. It was observed that while citizen translators could successfully translate emergency messages, a major threat to Co-TEM is that the official messages to be translated are sometimes flawed with jargons, ambiguity and lack of clarity. Recommendations are made to address this issue.","Ogie, R.I.; Perez, P.",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,555,1

During the pandemic, reflection on and attention to COVID-19 may help in dealing with its symptomology but frequent and persistent thoughts about the situation can be unhealthy. The present study examined the direct and indirect associations between obsession concerning COVID-19, psychological distress, life satisfaction, and meaning in life. Design: This mediation study presents a primary analysis of normative data collected after the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in Pakistan. Parametric bootstrapping was used to test the mediation models of subjective well-being, the extent of the effect, and meaning in life as parallel and serial mediators concerning the associations between COVID-19 obsession and psychological distress measures. Setting: A sample of 1,002 adults (45% men and 55% women) were recruited utilizing an online survey between April to May 2020. They were aged between 19 and 45 years (M = 24.30, SD = 7.29) and normalized on population characteristics. Results: Two out of three mediators in parallel mediation fully mediated the relationship between obsession and psychological distress (total effect = 0.443, SE = 0.050, p < 0.0001) illustrating that high-level obsessions were associated with low levels of satisfaction with life and presence of meaning in life and search for meaning in life. Psychological distress is likely to decrease in the presence of a high level of satisfaction with life and meaning. Moreover, satisfaction with life and search for meaning in life significantly mediated the association between COVID-19 obsession (z=-3.507, p < 0.0001 and z = −2.632, p < 0.001 respectively). Conclusion: The present study showed that life satisfaction and search for meaning in life may play a significant role in decreasing psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ashraf, Farzana; Zareen, Gull; Nusrat, Aasia; Arif, Amna; Griffiths, Mark D.",Front Psychol,555,14

METHODS: We conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses of HIV risk behavior using cross-sectional data from 501 young people from Mukono (Katosi landing site) and Namayingo districts (Lugala landing site). RESULTS: Almost all (97%) respondents reported at least one HIV risk behavior; more than half (54%) reported engagement in three or more HIV risk behaviors. Results from the adjusted model indicate that alcohol use, working for cash or kind, being married, and having multiple sexual partners increased the odds of HIV risk behavior.

In modern Western medicine, during non-crisis times, principlism provides the four guiding principles in biomedical ethics—autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice; autonomy typically emerges as the decisive principle. The physician–patient relationship is a deontological construct in which the physician’s primary duty is to the individual patient and the individual patient is paramount. For this reason, we term the non-crisis ethical framework that guides modern medicine Deontological Principlism. During times of crisis, resources become scarce, standards of care become dynamic, and public health ethics move to the forefront. Healthcare providers are forced to work in non-ideal conditions, and interactions with individual patients must be considered in the context of the crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced healthcare to shift to a more utilitarian framework with a greater focus on promoting the health of communities and populations. This paper puts forth the notion of Utilitarian Principlism as a framework for crisis healthcare ethics. We discuss each of the four principles from a utilitarian perspective and use clinical vignettes, based on real cases from the COVID-19 pandemic, for illustrative purposes. We explore how Deontological Principlism and Utilitarian Principlism are two ends of a spectrum, and the implications to healthcare as we emerge from the pandemic.","Vearrier, Laura; Henderson, Carrie M.",HEC Forum,555,1

PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of PE in COVID-19 and its associations with clinical and laboratory parameters. METHODS: Electronic medical records were searched retrospectively for demographic, clinical and laboratory data and outcomes in patients admitted with COVID-19 at 4 hospitals March-June 2020. PE on CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and perfusion scintigraphy was correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters. D-dimer was used to predict PE and the obtained threshold underwent an external validation on 85 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at a 5(th) hospital. We also assessed the association between right heart strain and embolic burden in patients with PE undergoing echocardiography. RESULTS: Four-hundred-thirteen patients with COVID-19 (230 men, aged 20-98 years, mean + SD = 60+16 years) were evaluated. PE was diagnosed in 25% (102/413, 95%CI: 21%-29%) of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, undergoing CTPA or perfusion scintigraphy. PE was observed in 29% (21/73, 95%CI:19% -41%) of ICU vs. 24% (81/340, 95%CI:20% -29%) of non-ICU patients (p=0.37). PE was associated with male sex(Odds Ratio=OR[95% CI]: 1.7[1.1–2.8], p=0.02), smoking (OR[95% CI]:1.8[1.01–3.4], p=0.04) and increased d-dimer (p<0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (p<0.001), ferritin (p=0.001) and IL-6 (p=0.02). Mortality in hospitalized patients was similar between those with PE and without PE (14%[13/102, 95%CI: 8% - 22%]vs 13%[40/311, 95%CI: 9% - 17%], p=0.98), suggesting that diagnosis and treatment of PE was not associated with excess mortality. D-dimer>1600 ng/mL predicts PE with 100% sensitivity and 62% specificity in an external validation cohort. Embolic burden was higher in patients with right heart strain among the patients with PE undergoing echocardiogram (p=0.03).

The immunological mechanisms that contain pneumococcus during colonization are well studied in mice but remain unclear in humans. Loss of this control of pneumococcus following infection with influenza virus is associated with secondary bacterial pneumonia. We used a human challenge model with type 6B pneumococcus to show that acquisition of pneumococcus induced early degranulation of resident neutrophils and recruitment of monocytes to the nose.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All initial chest CTs of patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at our emergency department between March 25 and April 25, 2020, were identified (n = 120). Three patient management groups were defined: group 1 (outpatient), group 2 (general ward), and group 3 (intensive care unit [ICU]). Multiple pulmonary and cardiovascular metrics were extracted from the chest CT images using deep learning. Additionally, six laboratory findings indicating inflammation and cellular damage were considered. Differences in CT metrics, laboratory findings, and demographics between the patient management groups were assessed. The potential of these parameters to predict patients' needs for intensive care (yes/no) was analyzed using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves. Internal and external validity were assessed using 109 independent chest CT scans. RESULTS: While demographic parameters alone (sex and age) were not sufficient to predict ICU management status, both CT metrics alone (including both pulmonary and cardiovascular metrics; area under the curve [AUC] = 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.79–0.97) and laboratory findings alone (C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, white blood cell count, and albumin; AUC = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.77–0.94) were good classifiers. Excellent performance was achieved by a combination of demographic parameters, CT metrics, and laboratory findings (AUC = 0.91; 95% CI = 0.85–0.98). Application of a model that combined both pulmonary CT metrics and demographic parameters on a dataset from another hospital indicated its external validity (AUC = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.66–0.88). CONCLUSION: Chest CT of patients with COVID-19 contains valuable information that can be accessed using automated image analysis. These metrics are useful for the prediction of patient management.","Weikert, Thomas; Rapaka, Saikiran; Grbic, Sasa; Re, Thomas; Chaganti, Shikha; Winkel, David J.; Anastasopoulos, Constantin; Niemann, Tilo; Wiggli, Benedikt J.; Bremerich, Jens; Twerenbold, Raphael; Sommer, Gregor; Comaniciu, Dorin; Sauter, Alexander W.",Korean J Radiol,555,20

To augment traditional lab and hospital-based surveillance, Bangladesh established a participatory surveillance system for the public to self-report symptoms consistent with COVID-19 through multiple channels. Here, we report on the use of this system, which received over 3 million responses within two months, for tracking the COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh. Although we observe considerable noise in the data and initial volatility in the use of the different reporting mechanisms, the self-reported syndromic data exhibits a strong association with lab-confirmed cases at a local scale. Moreover, the syndromic data also suggests an earlier spread of the outbreak across Bangladesh than is evident from the confirmed case counts, consistent with predicted spread of the outbreak based on population mobility data. Our results highlight the usefulness of participatory syndromic surveillance for mapping disease burden generally, and particularly during the initial phases of an emerging outbreak.","Mahmud, Ayesha S.; Chowdhury, Shayan; Sojib, Kawsar Hossain; Chowdhury, Anir; Quader, Md.

From December 2019 to date, more than 22 million cases have been reported worldwide and global health institutions are acting to slow down the virus transmission and are looking for possible prevention strategies in case of a new outbreak. As in other endemic or pandemic phenomena, the issues mostly covered by scientific and media attention are related to the diagnostic and therapeutic approach of COVID-19. However, a still neglected issue regards the adoption of a more systemic approach considering the close connection among the infection, the environment, and human behaviors, including the role of diet and urban management. To shed light on this issue, we brought together a faculty group involving experts in environment and biodiversity, food safety, human nutrition, and behavior, bioprospecting, as well as medical doctors having a deep knowledge of the complex historical relationship between humanity and vector-borne infections. Two main aspects emerged from the integrative overview of the current COVID-19 pandemic: (i) the scientific community should start sharing social actions and policy advocacy based on the assumption that human health strongly depends upon a sustainable exploitation of natural resources in populated areas; (ii) the specific strategic role of the cities in developing sustainable food systems and promoting healthy dietary patterns. Definitely, some priority issues should be addressed to achieve these goals, such as global efforts to increase food safety and security, which would benefit from urban and peri-urban agriculture enhancement, smallholder food producers support, and ecosystem services and local biodiversity maintenance.","Galimberti, Andrea; Cena, Hellas; Campone, Luca; Ferri, Emanuele; Dell'Agli, Mario; Sangiovanni, Enrico; Belingheri, Michael; Riva, Michele Augusto; Casiraghi, Maurizio; Labra, Massimo",Front Nutr,555,22

Cardiac biomarkers, like NT‐proBNP (N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide) and high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin T, might have predictive value. METHODS AND RESULTS: Echocardiography, ECG, hemodynamic parameters, NT‐proBNP and high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin T were assessed in 853 patients with early‐stage breast cancer randomized in the German Breast Group GeparOcto‐GBG 84 phase III trial. Patients received neo‐adjuvant dose‐dense, dose‐intensified epirubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide (iddEPC group, n=424) or paclitaxel, non‐pegylated doxorubicin, and in triple negative breast cancer, (paclitaxel, non‐pegylated doxorubicin, carboplatin group, n=429) treatment for 18 weeks. Patients positive for human epidermal growth receptor 2 (n=354, 41.5%) received monoclonal antibodies on top of allocated therapy; 119 (12.9%) of all patients showed a cardiotoxic reaction during therapy (15 [1.8%] using a more strict definition). Presence of cardiotoxic reactions was irrespective of treatment allocation (P=0.31). Small but significant increases in NT‐proBNP developed early in patients with a cardiotoxic reaction as compared with those without in whom NT‐proBNP rose only towards the end of therapy (P=0.04). High‐sensitivity cardiac troponin T rose early in both groups. Logistic regression showed that NT‐proBNP (odds ratio [OR], 1.03; 95% CI, 1.008–1.055; P=0.01) and hemoglobin (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.05–1.63; P=0.02) measured at 6 weeks after treatment initiation were significantly associated with cardiotoxic reactions. CONCLUSIONS: NT‐proBNP and hemoglobin are significantly associated with cardiotoxic reactions in patients with early‐stage breast cancer undergoing dose‐dense and dose‐intensified chemotherapy, but high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin T is not.

We aim to assess the efficacy and safety of Chinese medicine in treatment of coronavirus-related pneumonia with the updated results of relevant clinical trials. METHODS: Six electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chongqing VIP, and SinoMed will be searched to identify randomized controlled trials up to May 2020. Patients diagnosed with coronavirus-related pneumonia including severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and 2019 novel coronavirus disease and administrated with Chinese medicine will be included. The primary outcome is the all cause mortality at the longest follow up available. The second outcomes include the length of stay in hospital and intensive care units, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and adverse events. The pooled effects will be analyzed and reported as risk ratios for dichotomous data using the Mantel–Haenszel method or mean differences for continuous data using the inverse-variance method. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses will be performed to test the robustness of the results and to explore the potential sources of heterogeneities.

The case group consisted of 72 males and 28 females. 40 healthy adults without any history or clinical evidence suggestive of COVID-19 and without any comorbidities, like diabetes, hypertension chronic lung disease, cardiac disease, cancer, and immune-compromised individuals were considered as a control group for the study. Routine laboratory findings of these 100 patients were used to evaluate the abnormalities found in COVID-19 patients. Statistical analysis was carried out on the data after determining whether the data had a normal/log-normal distribution and their significance was determined by calculating the p-value. The percentage of patients showing a decrease or increase from the normal value was calculated. Trend analysis was carried out for the 100 patients considered in the case group. Among them, 6 patients were used as representatives to show the trend in these biomarkers during the course of hospital stay. These 5 severe cases consisted of 2 adult males, 2 adult females, and 1 adolescent girl. This selection is to demonstrate the representation of COVID-19 infection in adult males and females and pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19 in the younger age group.

Reliable forecasts of ILI can support better preparation for patient surges in healthcare systems. Although ILI is an amalgamation of multiple pathogens with variable seasonal phasing and attack rates, most existing process-based forecasting systems treat ILI as a single infectious agent. Here, using ILI records and virologic surveillance data, we show that ILI signal can be disaggregated into distinct viral components. We generate separate predictions for six contributing pathogens (influenza A/H1, A/H3, B, respiratory syncytial virus, and human parainfluenza virus types 1–2 and 3), and develop a method to forecast ILI by aggregating these predictions. The relative contribution of each pathogen to the total ILI signal is estimated using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method upon forecast aggregation. We find highly variable overall contributions from influenza type A viruses across seasons, but relatively stable contributions for the other pathogens. Using historical data from 1997 to 2014 at US national and regional levels, the proposed forecasting system generates improved predictions of both seasonal and near-term targets relative to a baseline method that simulates ILI as a single pathogen. The hierarchical forecasting system can generate predictions for each viral component, as well as infer and predict their contributions to ILI, which may additionally help physicians determine the etiological causes of ILI in clinical settings.","Pei, Sen; Shaman, Jeffrey",PLoS Comput Biol,555,1

Aim To examine antenatal stress and stress-reduction strategies, social support, and health behaviours between women pregnant before and during the pandemic in Ireland. Methods 210 pregnant women were recruited online and in the antenatal department of a tertiary maternity hospital before the pandemic, and 235 women recruited online during the pandemic. Only women resident in Ireland were included in this study. Women completed measures of stress, social support, health-behaviours, and self-reported stress-reduction strategies. Differences in outcomes were examined between women pregnant before and during the pandemic, and between Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the Irish Government COVID-19 restrictions. Findings Women pregnant during the pandemic reported lower perceived social support, including support from a significant other, friends and family, than women pregnant before the pandemic. There were no significant differences in stress in health behaviours but women reported higher stress and less physical activity during the pandemic. Women reported a range of comparable stress-reduction strategies before and during the pandemic. No differences were observed between phases of pandemic-related restrictions for any outcome. Discussion Our findings highlight negative impacts of the pandemic on social support, stress, and physical activity, which can have implications for maternal and child health. Lack of differences between restriction phases suggests on-going negative effects for antenatal well-being and behaviours. Conclusion .

We retrospectively evaluated nowcasting performance for case counts among residents diagnosed during March–May 2020, a period when the median reporting delay was 2 days. Nowcasts with a 2-week moving window and a negative binomial distribution had lower mean absolute error, lower relative root mean square error, and higher 95% prediction interval coverage than nowcasts conducted with a 3-week moving window or with a Poisson distribution. Nowcasts conducted toward the end of the week outperformed nowcasts performed earlier in the week, given fewer patients diagnosed on weekends and lack of day-of-week adjustments. When estimating case counts for weekdays only, metrics were similar across days the nowcasts were conducted, with Mondays having the lowest mean absolute error, of 183 cases in the context of an average daily weekday case count of 2,914. Nowcasting ensured that recent decreases in observed case counts were not overinterpreted as true declines and supported health department leadership in anticipating the magnitude and timing of hospitalizations and deaths and allocating resources geographically.","Greene, Sharon K.; McGough, Sarah F.; Culp, Gretchen M.; Graf, Laura E.; Lipsitch, Marc; Menzies, Nicolas A.; Kahn, Rebecca",medRxiv,555,20

Although these separate substantive areas agree that epidemiology refers to the distribution of disease in a population and the determinants of that distribution, the literature presents conflicting definitions of what makes a study a molecular epidemiologic study. In cancer and environmental epidemiology, molecular is defined almost exclusively in terms of biomarkers. However, biomarkers are only one type of molecular measure, and this definition ignores the many applications of molecular methods in genetic and infectious disease epidemiology. Early epidemiologists made tremendous strides with what are now relatively simple molecular tools, such as using microscopy for identification, showing agents not visible by microscope cause disease, and detecting protective antibodies with hemagglutination assays. In the microbiology literature, molecular epidemiology has become synonymous with the use of molecular fingerprints—regardless of whether the study was population based or met other criteria consistent with an epidemiologic study.

Climate-related disasters are known to pose-gender specific problems that disproportionately affect more women than men. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic’s impacts along gender lines are enormous, with women being the worst-affected. Existing studies have drawn connections between COVID-19 and climate change, with most arguing that responses to the pandemic provide an opportunity to tackle climate change through emission reduction strategies as part of recovery efforts. We introduce a new dimension to this connection by demonstrating that though different phenomena, COVID-19 and climate change are not so dissimilar in terms of their gendered socioeconomic impacts. Through a systematic review of the available literature, we establish a nexus between these impacts, and examine how the gender responses to COVID-19 can be leveraged to address gender-related climate impacts. We find that social protection, labor market, economic, and violence against women measures adopted in response to the pandemic provide a good opportunity to address the gender impacts of climate change as well. However, current COVID-19 gender responses do not incorporate the interconnections between the gender impacts of the pandemic and climate change. Adopting a nexus approach could help to leverage COVID-19 responses to address the gendered socioeconomic impacts of both crises.","Akrofi, Mark M.; Mahama, Mudasiru; Nevo, Chinedu M.",SN Soc Sci,555,15

METHODS: Serology assays from Roche, Abbott, Diasorin, BioMerieux, Beckman-Coulter, Siemens, and Mt.-Sinai ELISA were included. Negative samples from 2391 individuals representative of the Israeli population, and 698 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients, collected between March and May 2020, were analyzed FINDINGS: Immunoassays sensitivities between 81.5%-89.4% and specificities between 97.7%-100% resulted in a profound impact on the expected Positive Predictive Value (PPV) in low (<15%) prevalence scenarios. No meaningful increase was detected in the false positive rate in children compared to adults. A positive correlation between disease severity and antibody titers, and no decrease in antibody titers in the first 8 weeks after PCR positivity was observed. We identified a subgroup of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (~5% of patients), who remained seronegative across a wide range of antigens, isotypes, and technologies. INTERPRETATION: wThe commercially available automated immunoassays exhibit significant differences in performance and expected PPV in low prevalence scenarios. The low false-positivity rate in under 20′s suggests that cross-reactive immunity from previous CoV strains is unlikely to explain the milder disease course in children. Finding no decrease in antibody titers in the first 8 weeks is in contrast to some reports of short half-life for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The ~5% who were seronegative non-responders, using multiple assays in a population-wide manner, represents the proportion of patients that may be at risk for re-infection.

Moreover, this study aimed to discuss the possible pathobiological mechanisms of anosmia and dysgeusia in COVID-19. Methods: Available articles from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and preprint databases (MedRxiv, BioRxiv, and Researchsquare) were searched on November 10th, 2020. Data on the characteristics of the study (anosmia, dysgeusia, and COVID-19) were extracted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Newcastle–Ottawa scale was used to assess research quality. Moreover, the pooled prevalence of anosmia and dysgeusia were calculated, and the association between anosmia and dysgeusia in presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was assessed using the Z test. Results: Out of 32,142 COVID-19 patients from 107 studies, anosmia was reported in 12,038 patients with a prevalence of 38.2% (95% CI: 36.5%, 47.2%); whereas, dysgeusia was reported in 11,337 patients out of 30,901 COVID-19 patients from 101 studies, with prevalence of 36.6% (95% CI: 35.2%, 45.2%), worldwide. Furthermore, the prevalence of anosmia was 10.2-fold higher (OR: 10.21; 95% CI: 6.53, 15.96, p < 0.001) and that of dysgeusia was 8.6-fold higher (OR: 8.61; 95% CI: 5.26, 14.11, p < 0.001) in COVID-19 patients compared to those with other respiratory infections or COVID-19 like illness. To date, no study has assessed the association of anosmia and dysgeusia with severity and mortality of COVID-19. Conclusion: Anosmia and dysgeusia are prevalent in COVID-19 patients compared to those with the other non-COVID-19 respiratory infections. Several possible mechanisms have been hypothesized; however, future studies are warranted to elucidate the definitive mechanisms of anosmia and dysgeusia in COVID-19.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among students and employees of two higher education institutions in Lahore, Pakistan, namely the University of Lahore and the Gulab Devi Educational Complex. Participants were recruited using a convenient sampling method. A validated 45-item, self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Total possible scores were 0–14 for knowledge (scores < 7, 7–10 and > 10 were considered to indicate poor, moderate and good knowledge, respectively); 0–7 for attitude (scores > 5 were considered to indicate a good attitude); and 0–18 for COVID-19 preventative practices (scores > 12 were considered to indicate good preventative practices). RESULTS: Of the 417 enrolled participants, 416 reported that they were aware of COVID-19 and social media was the major source of their information. Mean scores were 10.12 ± 2.20 for knowledge (good, moderate and poor knowledge in 50.2%, 42.8% and 7.0% of participants, respectively); 5.74 ± 1.28 for attitude (65.4% of individuals had a positive attitude); and 11.04 ± 3.34 for COVID-19 preventative practices (only 36.5% of participants had good preventive practices).

However, different products may have diverse immunomodulation. The experiment was conducted to examine effects of mannan oligosaccharide (Actigen; ACT) on growth performance and serum concentrations of antibodies and inflammatory mediators in weanling pigs (Sus scrofa) experimentally infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). A total of 32 PRRSV-negative pigs (3 wk old) were randomly assigned from within blocks to 1 of 4 treatments in a 2 by 2 factorial arrangement [2 types of diet: control (0%) and ACT addition (0.04%); and with and without PRRSV] in a randomized complete block design. Pigs were blocked by initial BW within sex. Ancestry was equalized across treatments. Pigs (8/treatment) were kept individually in each pen. After 2 wk of an 8-wk period of feeding the treatments, pigs received an intranasal inoculation of PRRSV or sham medium at 5 wk of age. Infection by PRRSV decreased ADG, ADFI, and G:F throughout the experiment (P < 0.01). Actigen did not affect ADG (P = 0.450), but decreased (P = 0.047) ADFI from 28 to 42 days postinoculation (DPI). During that time, ACT improved G:F in infected pigs but not in sham controls (interaction, P = 0.009). Dietary ACT did not affect viremia in infected pigs (P > 0.05), but increased PRRSV-specific antibody titer at 35 DPI (P = 0.042). Infection with PRRSV induced the febrile responses of pigs from 3 to 10 DPI (P < 0.001) with return to normal at 14 DPI. During the experimental period, the rectal temperature of pigs was found slightly elevated by ACT (P = 0.045). Infected pigs had greater serum concentrations of IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-12, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-10, and haptoglobin (Hp) than sham controls (P < 0.001). These results indicate that PRRSV stimulated secretion of cytokines involved in innate, T-helper 1, and T-regulatory immune responses. Actigen tended to decrease the serum TNF-α concentration regardless of PRRSV (P = 0.058). The ACT × PRRSV interaction was significant for IL-1β (P = 0.016), IL-12 (P = 0.026), and Hp (P = 0.047), suggesting that infected pigs fed ACT had greater serum concentrations of these mediators than those fed the control. The increases in IL-1β and IL-12 may favorably promote innate and T-cell immune functions in infected pigs fed ACT. Feeding ACT may be useful as ACT is related to increased PRRSV antibody titers and G:F in infected pigs at certain times during infection.","Che, T. M.; Song, M.; Liu, Y.; Johnson, R. W.; Kelley, K.

It is often estimated for various diseases through analysis of surveillance data, case reports, or record examinations. Reported CFR values for Yellow Fever vary, offering wide ranges. Estimates have not been found through systematic literature review, which has been used to estimate CFR of other diseases. This study aims to estimate the case fatality risk of severe Yellow Fever cases through a systematic literature review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A search strategy was implemented in PubMed and Ovid Medline in June 2019 and updated in March 2021, seeking reported severe case counts, defined by fever and either jaundice or hemorrhaging, and the number of those that were fatal. The searches yielded 1,133 studies, and title/abstract review followed by full text review produced 14 articles reporting 32 proportions of fatal cases, 26 of which were suitable for meta-analysis. Four studies with one proportion each were added to include clinical case data from the recent outbreak in Brazil. Data were analyzed through an intercept-only logistic meta-regression with random effects for study. Values of the I(2) statistic measured heterogeneity across studies. RESULTS: The estimated CFR was 39 % (95 % CI: 31 %, 47 %). Stratifying by continent showed that South America observed a higher CFR than Africa, though fewer studies reported estimates for South America. No difference was seen between studies reporting surveillance data and studies investigating outbreaks, and no difference was seen among different symptom definitions. High heterogeneity was observed across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 39 % of severe Yellow Fever cases are estimated to be fatal. This study provides the first systematic literature review to estimate the CFR of Yellow Fever, which can provide insight into outbreak preparedness and estimating underreporting.

At the beginning of April, Bushehr was announced as a white, coronavirus-free, province. However, increasing the temperature in the next months did not affect the spread of coronavirus and the number of confirmed cases increased during the next months, so that Bushehr was announced as a Red province on June 13, 2020. Methods: This paper aims 1) to estimate the reproduction number of COVID-19 in Bushehr considering COVID-19 reported cases of Bushehr from April to June 12, 2020, using exponential function and SIR epidemic model, and 2) to investigate the impact of temperature on reproduction number and the spread of coronavirus in Bushehr the temperature data. Result: The reproduction number is estimated to be between 2.564 to 2.641. Regarding the increase of the temperature during April to June, the results show that not only was the spread of COVID-19 not reduced but it also increased.

Given university students constitute a significant proportion of the population in Vietnam, to improve the prevention and control of COVID-19 in Vietnam and comparable countries, we examined their knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) towards face mask use which is an important preventive measure and the association between the levels of COVID-19 knowledge and KAP towards face mask use. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on all students studying at Phenikaa University, Hanoi, using a self-developed questionnaire consisted of 42 questions regarding KAP towards face mask use as well as reuse of cloth mask, and COVID-19 knowledge. Among 728 participants, 40.9% (298/728) were male, 63.2% (460/728) were from health-related faculties, 46% (335/728) lived in urban areas, and 51.9% (378) had good levels of COVID-19 knowledge. Regarding face mask, most (89.7%, 653/728) participants had good knowledge scores, 72.8% (530/728) had positive attitudes, and 76.5% (557/728) had good practice scores. The most common types of masks used were surgical mask (57.6%, 419/728), followed by non-antibacterial cloth mask (23.1%, 168/728). Among 168 participants using non-antibacterial cloth mask, 43.5% reused masks (73/168), of whom 6.8% (5/73) did not wash their masks at least daily. Face mask use knowledge was statistically associated with COVID-19 knowledge (P < 0.001). Face mask use attitudes were statistically associated with education levels (P = 0.02), and COVID-19 knowledge (P < 0.001). Practice of face mask use was statistically associated with gender (P = 0.03), geographical distribution (P = 0.04), academic majors (P = 0.02), and COVID-19 knowledge (P = 0.01).

We aimed to compare ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a treatment for patients with severe MERS-CoV infection with a supportive therapy only. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included adults (aged ≥16 years) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection and pneumonia needing ventilation support, diagnosed between Oct 23, 2012, and May 1, 2014, at the Prince Sultan Military Medical City (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). All patients received appropriate supportive care and regular clinical and laboratory monitoring, but patients diagnosed after Sept 16, 2013, were also given oral ribavirin (dose based on calculated creatinine clearance, for 8–10 days) and subcutaneous pegylated interferon alfa-2a (180 μg per week for 2 weeks). The primary endpoint was 14-day and 28-day survival from the date of MERS-CoV infection diagnosis. We used χ(2) and Fischer's exact test to analyse categorical variables and the t test to analyse continuous variables. FINDINGS: We analysed 20 patients who received ribavirin and interferon (treatment group; initiated a median of 3 days [range 0–8] after diagnosis) and 24 who did not (comparator group). Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics were similar between groups, apart from baseline absolute neutrophil count, which was significantly lower in the comparator group (5·88 × 10(9)/L [SD 3·95] vs 9·88 × 10(9)/L [6·63]; p=0·023). 14 (70%) of 20 patients in the treatment group had survived after 14 days, compared with seven (29%) of 24 in the comparator group (p=0·004). After 28 days, six (30%) of 20 and four (17%) of 24, respectively, had survived (p=0·054). Adverse effects were similar between groups, apart from reduction in haemoglobin, which was significantly greater in the treatment group than in the comparator group (4·32 g/L [SD 2·47] vs 2·14 g/L [1·90]; p=0·002). INTERPRETATION: In patients with severe MERS-CoV infection, ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a therapy is associated with significantly improved survival at 14 days, but not at 28 days. Further assessment in appropriately designed randomised trials is recommended.

The crisis has spurred the ongoing development of drugs targeting its etiological agent, the SARS-CoV-2. Targeting relevant protein-protein interaction interfaces (PPIIs) is a viable paradigm for the design of antiviral drugs and enriches the targetable chemical space by providing alternative targets for drug discovery. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the theory, methods and applications of PPII-targeted drug development towards COVID-19 based on recent literature. We will also highlight novel developments, such as the successful use of non-native protein-protein interactions as targets for antiviral drug screening. We hope that this review may serve as an entry point for those interested in applying PPIIs towards COVID-19 drug discovery and speed up drug development against the pandemic.","Chang, Chung-ke; Lin, Shan-Meng; Satange, Roshan; Lin, Shih-Chao; Sun, Sin-Cih; Wu, Hung-Yi; Kehn-Hall, Kylene; Hou, Ming-Hon",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,555,10

Recent studies suggested that long-term environmental exposures may be important determinants of severe COVID-19. However, very few environmental factors have been studied, often separately, without considering the totality of the external environment (i.e., the external exposome). We conducted an external exposome-wide association study (ExWAS) using the nationwide county-level COVID-19 mortality data in the contiguous US. A total of 337 variables characterizing the external exposome from 8 data sources were integrated, harmonized, and spatiotemporally linked to each county. A two-phase procedure was used: (1) in Phase 1, a random 50:50 split divided the data into a discovery set and a replication set, and associations between COVID-19 mortality and individual factors were examined using mixed-effect negative binomial regression models, with multiple comparisons addressed, and (2) in Phase 2, a multivariable regression model including all variables that are significant from both the discovery and replication sets in Phase 1 was fitted. A total of 13 and 22 variables were significant in the discovery and replication sets in Phase 1, respectively. All the 4 variables that were significant in both sets in Phase 1 remained statistically significant in Phase 2, including two air toxicants (i.e., nitrogen dioxide or NO2, and benzidine), one vacant land measure, and one food environment measure. This is the first external exposome study of COVID-19 mortality. It confirmed some of the previously reported environmental factors associated with COVID-19 mortality, but also generated unexpected predictors that may warrant more focused evaluation.","Hu, Hui; Zheng, Yi; Wen, Xiaoxiao; Smith, Sabrina S.; Nizomov, Javlon; Fishe, Jennifer; Hogan, William R.; Shenkman, Elizabeth A.; Bian, Jiang",Sci Total Environ,555,1

Routinely recorded, clinical data, up to the 24th of April 2020, from the 2075 patients with Covid-19, admitted in 17 hospitals in Spain between the 1st of March and the 20th of April 2020 were used. The following variables were extracted for this study: age, gender, temperature, and saturation of oxygen on admission, treatment with heparin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, steroids, tocilizumab, a combination of lopinavir with ritonavir, and oseltamivir, together with data on mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations. At the time of collecting the data, 301 patients had died, 1447 had been discharged home from the hospitals, 201 were still admitted, and 126 had been transferred to hospitals not included in the study. Median follow up time was 8 (IQR 5–12) days. Heparin had been used in 1734 patients. Heparin was associated with lower mortality when the model was adjusted for age and gender, with OR (95% CI) 0.55 (0.37–0.82) p = 0.003. This association remained significant when saturation of oxygen < 90%, and temperature > 37 °C were added to de model with OR 0.54 (0.36–0.82) p = 0.003, and also when all the other drugs were included as covariates OR 0.42 (0.26–0.66) p < 0.001. The association between heparin and lower mortality observed in this study can be acknowledged by clinicians in hospitals and in the community. Randomized controlled trials to assess the causal effects of heparin in different therapeutic regimes are required.","Ayerbe, Luis; Risco, Carlos; Ayis, Salma",J Thromb Thrombolysis,555,33

This study focuses on a case study of National Research Council of Italy (CNR), one of largest European public research organizations, to identify evolution of research activities and dynamics of scientific production from 2000 to 2019. The statistical analysis suggests that, in line with the origin of the CNR, scientific research focuses mainly on research fields of natural sciences, such as chemical, life and physical sciences, with an increasing role of scientific research in energy, engineering and mathematics. The study also shows a high intensity of collaboration of the CNR within international research networks. A key finding of this study is to show, for the first time, that although uncertain reforms and reductions of public funds, scientific productivity is growing. This novel result can be explained with self-determination of scholars as a vital determinant supporting scientific production that outclasses shrinking public research lab budgets and organizational deficiencies. The management and research policy implications of this study can be generalized to support an efficient organizational and managerial behavior, and higher scientific productivity of public research institutes in contexts of reduced public funding and market turbulence.","Pagliaro, Mario; Coccia, Mario",Heliyon,555,18

Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who are receiving non-vitamin K antagonists or direct oral anticoagulants for chronic disease are usually switched to heparin treatment during hospitalization. However, information about the most appropriate antithrombotic therapy after the acute infection phase is lacking. CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a patient with chronic atrial fibrillation who was recently hospitalized for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Four weeks after discharge he experienced an episode of an acute pulmonary embolism while on rivaroxaban therapy with adequate drug plasma levels, and in the absence of strong predisposing risk factors. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the risk of thrombotic complications after COVID-19 infection, raises some concern about their underlying mechanisms, and supports the use of effective anti-thrombotic therapy. LEARNING POINTS: COVID-19 infection is associated with frequent thrombotic events. A pro-coagulative status could be triggered by the persistent inflammatory phase of the infection despite anticoagulation. Adequate antithrombotic therapy is necessary for the prevention of acute and later thrombotic complications and needs close monitoring.","Di Tano, Giuseppe; Moschini, Luigi; Loffi, Marco; Testa, Sophie; Danzi, Gian Battista",Eur J Case Rep Intern Med,555,24

C. glabrata was the most prevalent fungal species isolated from the routine samples. It was the only fungus which was shed by the calves on the 2 farms, for continuous, more or less prolonged periods, but exclusively in the winter months. Diarrhea and C. glabrata shedding seemed to be associated. C. glabrata colonized the abomasum (the functional equivalent of the monogastric stomach) but not the other segments of the digestive tract of the euthanized calf Based on the findings of this study it seems that while some yeast species may be considered as commensals of the digestive tract of calves, and consequently their isolation from intestinal contents or fecal samples has no clinical significance, others, such as C. glabrata may be involved in enteric pathogenic processes. Moreover, characteristics of the culture, previous chemotherapeutic treatments, the animal's age and possibly climatic conditions should be taken into account before deciding on the fungal isolate's clinical relevance. Determination of mycotic involvement in NCD by routine mycological examination of intestinal contents and fecal samples of diarrheic calves may be useful to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful antibacterial therapy.","Elad, D.; Brenner, J.; Markovics, A.; Yakobson, B.; Shlomovitz, S.; Basan, J.",Mycopathologia,555,16

In the well-understood classical TGF-β signaling pathway, TGF-β activates Smad signalling via its two cell surface receptors such as TβRII and ALK5/TβRI, leading to Smad-mediated transcriptional regulation. In addition, TGF-β may also activate other signaling pathways like mitogen-activated protein kinase, PI3K, etc. The signaling of TGF-β is finely regulated at different levels. Inhibitory Smads, including Smad6 and Smad7, are key regulators of TGF-β/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling by negative feedback loops. They can form stable complexes with activated type I receptors and thereby blocking the phosphorylation of R-Smads, or recruit ubiquitin E3 ligases, such as Smurf1/2, resulting in the ubiquitination and degradation of the activated type I receptors. Besides, these inhibitory Smad proteins also inhibit TGF-β/BMP signaling in the nucleus by interacting with transcriptional repressors, such as histone deacetylases, Hoxc-8, and CtBP, or disrupting the formation of the TGF-β-induced functional Smad-DNA complexes. Smad7 is in turn regulated by different stimuli, including TGF-β, IFN-γ, TNF-α as well as ultraviolet and TPA, and mediates the crosstalk between TGF-β and other signaling pathways. Deregulation of Smad7 expression has been associated with various human diseases, such as tissue fibrosis, inflammatory disease as well as carcinogenesis. Overexpression of Smad7 has been shown to antagonize TGF-β-mediated fibrosis, carcinogenesis, and inflammation, suggesting a therapeutic potential of Smad7 to treat these diseases.","Yan, Xiaohua; Liu, Ziying; Chen, Yeguang",Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),555,16

The new ligand and its complexes were fully characterized by analytical and spectral techniques. The ligand behaved as a neutral tridentate in its keto-form towards the metals via O(8), O(10) and O(18) atoms. This was suggested based on the lower shift of υ(CH=O), υ(C=O)(amide) and υ(C-O) vibrations. The electronic transitions in Co(II)-HL and Cu(II)-HL complexes displayed d-d- transitions which belong to (4)T(1g)→(4)A(2g)(F) & (4)T(1g)(F)→(4)T(1g) (P) and (2)Eg →(2)T(2)g, in the two complexes, respectively. ESR spectrum of Cu(II)-HL complex displayed g-factor by the following order; g(//)(2.1740)>g(⊥)(2.0935)>2.0023, which agrees with octahedral geometry. The geometry optimization was executed by DFT/B3LYP method under valence double zeta polarized basis set (6-31G*), to confirm the structural forms and the mode of bonding. The orientation and the charges of O(8), O(10) and O(18) atoms, support the coordination of the ligand in its keto-form with the metal ions. Pharmacophore profiles were obtained regarding thiazole ligand and other recommended drugs (arbidol, avigan and idoxuridine) that used in treatment protocol of COVID-19 pandemic. Also, query was run in MolPort-library to obtain antiviral analogues, to broaden the search for an effective treatment. Three analogues were obtained for arbidol, avigan and idoxuridine drugs, which have the following numbers; MolPort-047-605-644, MolPort-004-768-508 and MolPort-028-750-709, respectively. Moreover, molecular docking was carried out to obtain all interaction details and rank the efficiency of thiazole compound versus the three antivirals in their interaction with the two COVID-19 proteins. The outcomes suggested the significant antiviral activity of idoxuridine and thiazole (enol-form), which not reach to eliminate the pandemic exactly. While, arbidol and avigan did not have an effective antiviral role, although they still used in COVID-19 treatment protocol.","Almalki, Samira A.; Bawazeer, Tahani M.; Asghar, Basim; Alharbi, Arwa; Aljohani, Meshari M.; Khalifa, Mohamed E.; El-Metwaly, Nashwa",J Mol Struct,555,1

Methods: We used the generalized linear model to examine the associations between non-pharmaceutical measures adopted by China and South Korea and the number of confirmed cases. Policy disparities were also discussed between these two countries. Results: The results show that the following factors influence the number of confirmed cases in China: lockdown of Wuhan city (LWC); establishment of a Leading Group by the Central Government; raising the public health emergency response to the highest level in all localities; classifying management of “four categories of personnel”; makeshift hospitals in operation (MHIO); pairing assistance (PA); launching massive community screening (LMCS). In South Korea, these following factors were the key influencing factors of the cumulative confirmed cases: raising the public alert level to orange (three out of four levels); raising the public alert to the highest level; launching drive-through screening centers (LDSC); screening all members of Shincheonji religious group; launching Community Treatment Center (LCTC); distributing public face masks nationwide and quarantining all travelers from overseas countries for 14 days. Conclusion: Based on the analysis of the generalized linear model, we found that a series of non-pharmaceutical measures were associated with contain of the COVID-19 outbreak in China and South Korea. The following measures were crucial for both of them to fight against the COVID-19 epidemic: a strong national response system, expanding diagnostic tests, establishing makeshift hospitals, and quarantine or lockdown affected areas.","Chen, Haiqian; Shi, Leiyu; Zhang, Yuyao; Wang, Xiaohan; Sun, Gang",J Epidemiol Glob Health,555,20

Methods: We included all positive nose and throat swabs between 26 April-11 October 2020 from the UK national COVID-19 Infection Survey, tested by RT-PCR for the N, S and ORF1ab genes. We investigated predictors of median Ct value using quantile regression. Results: 1892(0.22%) of 843,851 results were positive, 1362(72%), 185(10%) and 345(18%) for 3, 2 or 1 genes respectively. Ct for different genes were strongly correlated (rho=0.99) with overall median Ct 26.2 (IQR 19.7-31.1; range 10.3-37.6), corresponding to ~2,500 dC/ml (IQR 80-240,000). Ct values were independently lower in those reporting symptoms, with more genes detected, and in first (vs. subsequent) positives per-participant, with no evidence of independent effects of sex, ethnicity, age, deprivation or other test characteristics (p>0.20). Whilst single-gene positives without reported symptoms almost invariably had Ct>30, triple-gene positives without reported symptoms had widely varying Ct. Incorporating pre-test probability and Ct values, 1547(82%) and 112(6%) positives had higher or lower supporting evidence for genuine infection. Ct values, symptomatic percentages and supporting evidence changed over time. With lower positivity in the summer, there were proportionally more lower evidence positives, and higher evidence positives had higher Ct values (p<0.0001), suggesting lower viral burden. Declines in mean/median Ct values were apparent throughout August and preceded increases in positivity rates. Conclusions: Community SARS-CoV-2 infections show marked variation in viral load.

Transmission tends to be more effective in select settings that involve exposure to relatively high viral dose, such as in crowded indoor settings, assisted living facilities, prisons, or food processing plants. To explore the effect on infection dynamics, we describe a new mathematical model where transmission can occur (i) in the community at large, characterized by low dose exposure and mostly mild disease, and (ii) in so called transmission hot zones, characterized by high dose exposure that can be associated with more severe disease. Interestingly, we find that successful infection spread can hinge upon high-dose hot zone transmission, yet the majority of infections are predicted to occur in the community at large with mild disease. This gives rise to the prediction that targeted interventions that specifically reduce virus transmission in the hot zones (but not in the community at large) have the potential to suppress overall infection spread, including in the community at large. The model can further reconcile seemingly contradicting epidemiological observations. While in some locations like California, strict stay-home orders failed to significantly reduce infection prevalence, in other locations, such as New York and several European countries, stay-home orders lead to a pronounced fall in infection levels, which remained suppressed for some months after re-opening of society. Differences in hot zone transmission levels during and after social distancing interventions can account for these diverging infection patterns. These modeling results warrant further epidemiological investigations into the role of high dose hot zone transmission for the maintenance of SARS-CoV-2 spread.","Wodarz, Dominik; Komarova, Natalia L.; Schang, Luis M.",medRxiv,555,16

Moreover, it has become a global pandemic. This is of great value in describing the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients in detail and looking for markers which are significant to predict the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective study, 476 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled from a consecutive series. After screening, a total of 395 patients were included in this study. All-cause death was the primary endpoint. All patients were followed up from admission till discharge or death. RESULTS: The main symptoms observed in the study included fever on admission, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. The most common comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Patients with lower CD4(+)T cell level were older and more often male compared to those with higher CD4(+)T cell level. Reduced CD8(+)T cell level was an indicator of the severity of COVID-19. Both decreased CD4(+)T [HR:13.659; 95%CI: 3.235–57.671] and CD8(+)T [HR: 10.883; 95%CI: 3.277–36.145] cell levels were associated with in-hospital death in COVID-19 patients, but only the decrease of CD4(+)T cell level was an independent predictor of in-hospital death in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in lymphocytes and lymphocyte subsets were common in COVID-19 patients, especially in severe cases of COVID-19. It was the CD8(+)T cell level, not the CD4(+)T cell level, that reflected the severity of the patient’s disease. Only reduced CD4(+)T cell level was independently associated with increased in-hospital death in COVID-19 patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Prognostic Factors of Patients With COVID-19, NCT04292964.

In addition, no directory has been established listing all the apps developed to address the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify smartphone apps designed to address the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze their characteristics. METHODS: We performed an observational, cross-sectional, descriptive study of all smartphone apps associated with COVID-19. Between April 27 and May 2, 2020, we searched the App Store (iOS) and Google Play Store (Android) for COVID-19 apps. The search terms used were coronavirus, COVID-19, and SARS-COV-2. The apps were downloaded and evaluated. The variables analyzed were name, platform, country, language, category, cost, update date, size, version, number of downloads, developer, and purpose. Purpose was further classified into the following categories: news, general information, self-diagnosis, contact tracing, notices to contacts, notification of close cases, awareness, helplines, monitoring of clinical parameters, recording of symptoms and treatment, and messaging with health care professionals. RESULTS: We identified 114 apps on the investigated platforms. Of these, 62/114 (54.4%) were on Android and 52/114 (45.6%) were on iOS. Of the 114 apps, 37 (32.5%) were developed in Europe, 32 (28.1%) in Asia, and 30 (26.3%) in North America. The most frequent languages were English (65/114, 57.0%), Spanish (34/114, 29.8%), and Chinese (14/114, 12.3%). The most common categories were health and well-being/fitness apps (41/114, 41.2%) and medicine apps (43/114, 37.7%). Of the 114 apps, 113 (99.1%) were free. The mean time between the date of the analysis and the date of the last update was 11.1 days (SD 11.0). Overall, 95 of the 114 apps (83.3%) were intended for the general population, 99 apps (7.9%) were intended for health professionals, and 3 apps (2.6%) were intended for both. Regarding the type of developer, 64/114 apps (56.1%) were developed by governments; 42/114 (64.1%) were developed by national governments, and 23/114 (35.9%) were developed by regional governments. The apps with the highest number of downloads (100,000+) were developed by governments (P=.13), except for the World Health Organization app (500,000+). The purposes of the apps available in Western languages (107/114, 93.9%) were determined; the most common purposes were general information about COVID-19 (66, 64.0%), COVID-19 news (53, 51.0%), recording of symptoms (53, 51.0%), and contact tracing (51, 47.7%). More than one purpose was identified for 99/107 apps (92.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This paper offers a comprehensive and unique review of all available COVID-19 apps.

Children, although less directly affected by the virus, are paying a heavy price through the indirect effects of the crisis, including poor diet, mental health impact, social isolation, addiction to screens and lack of schooling and health care, particularly among vulnerable groups. This paper is aimed at discussing the potential impact of this pandemic on children’s nutrition and lifestyle. Preliminary data from the literature and from our survey show significant disruptions in nutrition and lifestyle habits of children. While undernutrition is expected to worsen in poor countries, obesity rates could increase in middle- and high-income countries especially among precarious groups widening the gap in health and social inequalities. The real impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children extends well beyond that of a viral infection. This crisis has public health implications that could have life-long consequences on children. It requires effective and targeted measures mainly for vulnerable children and households to guarantee children’s basic rights for optimal nutrition, health and development.","Zemrani, Boutaina; Gehri, Mario; Masserey, Eric; Knob, Cyril; Pellaton, Rachel",Int J Equity Health,555,9

A large proportion of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization and/or succumbing to the disease have had diabetes and other chronic conditions as underlying risk factors. In particular, individuals belonging to racial/ethnic minorities in the U.S. and other countries have been significantly and disproportionately impacted. Multiple and complex socioeconomic factors have long played a role in increasing the risk for diabetes and now for COVID-19. Since the pandemic began, the global healthcare community has accumulated invaluable clinical experience on providing diabetes care in the setting of COVID-19. In addition, understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms that link these two diseases is being developed. The current clinical management of diabetes is a work in progress, requiring a shift in patient-provider interaction beyond the walls of clinics and hospitals: the use of tele-medicine when feasible, innovative patient education programs, strategies to ensure medication and glucose testing availability and affordability, as well as numerous ideas on how to improve meal plans and physical activity.

Antiviral peptides are superior to conventional drugs and may also be effective against COVID-19. Hence, we investigated the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (nCoV-RBD) that interacts with hACE2 for viral attachment and entry. Methods: Three strategies and bioinformatics approaches were employed to design potential nCoV-RBD - hACE2 interaction-blocking peptides that may restrict viral attachment and entry. Firstly, the key residues interacting with nCoV-RBD - hACE2 are identified and hACE2 sequence-based peptides are designed. Second, peptides from five antibacterial peptide databases that block nCoV-RBD are identified; finally, a chimeric peptide design approach is used to design peptides that can bind to key nCoV-RBD residues. The final peptides are selected based on their physiochemical properties, numbers and positions of key residues binding, binding energy, and antiviral properties. Results: We found that: (i) three amino acid stretches in hACE2 interact with nCoV-RBD; (ii) effective peptides must bind to three key positions of nCoV-RBD (Gly485/Phe486/Asn487, Gln493, and Gln498/Thr500/Asn501); (iii) Phe486, Gln493, and Asn501 are critical residues; (iv) AC20 and AC23 derived from hACE2 may block two key critical positions; (iv) DBP6 identified from databases can block the three sites of the nCoV-RBD and interacts with one critical position, Gln498; (v) seven chimeric peptides were considered promising, among which cnCoVP-3, cnCoVP-4, and cnCoVP-7 are the top three; and (vi) cnCoVP-4 meets all the criteria and is the best peptide. Conclusions: To conclude, using three different bioinformatics approaches, we identified 17 peptides that can potentially bind to the nCoV-RBD that interacts with hACE2. Binding these peptides to nCoV-RBD may potentially inhibit the virus to access hACE2 and thereby may prevent the infection. Out of 17, 10 peptides have promising potential and need further experimental validation.","Barh, Debmalya; Tiwari, Sandeep; Silva Andrade, Bruno; Giovanetti, Marta; Almeida Costa, Eduardo; Kumavath, Ranjith; Ghosh, Preetam; Góes-Neto, Aristóteles; Carlos Junior Alcantara, Luiz; Azevedo, Vasco",F1000Res,555,16

Cohort studies demonstrated that lower respiratory tract infections in the first years of life are associated with an increased risk of wheezing and asthma, while the association with lung function is less clear. Additionally, the gut and airway microbiome might influence the risk of wheezing and asthma. The interaction between respiratory tract infections and the microbiome complicates studies of their associations with wheezing, asthma, and lung function. Furthermore, the causality behind these observations is still unclear, and several other factors such as genetic susceptibility and the immune system might be of importance.

METHOD: 287 survivors from COVID‐19 were included in the study, each received a questionnaire divided into three main parts starting from subjects’ demographic data, data about the COVID‐19 status and other comorbidities of the subject, and finally data about post‐COVID‐19 manifestations. Response surface plots were produced to visualize the link between several factors. RESULTS: Only 10.8 % of all subjects have no manifestation after recovery from the disease while a large percentage of subjects suffered from several symptoms and diseases. The most common symptom reported was fatigue (72.8 %), more critical manifestations like stroke, renal failure, myocarditis, and pulmonary fibrosis were reported by a few percent of the subjects. There was a relationship between the presence of other comorbidities and severity of the disease. Also, the severity of COVID‐19 was related to the severity of post‐COVID‐19 manifestations.

We developed the Integrated Cognitive Assessment (ICA); a 5-min, language independent computerised cognitive test that employs an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to improve its accuracy in detecting cognitive impairment. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the generalisability of the ICA in detecting cognitive impairment in MCI and mild AD patients. Methods: We studied the ICA in 230 participants. 95 healthy volunteers, 80 MCI, and 55 mild AD participants completed the ICA, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE) cognitive tests. Results: The ICA demonstrated convergent validity with MoCA (Pearson r=0.58, p<0.0001) and ACE (r=0.62, p<0.0001). The ICA AI model was able to detect cognitive impairment with an AUC of 81% for MCI patients, and 88% for mild AD patients. The AI model demonstrated improved performance with increased training data and showed generalisability in performance from one population to another. The ICA correlation of 0.17 (p = 0.01) with education years is considerably smaller than that of MoCA (r = 0.34, p < 0.0001) and ACE (r = 0.41, p < 0.0001) which displayed significant correlations. In a separate study the ICA demonstrated no significant practise effect over the duration of the study. Discussion: The ICA can support clinicians by aiding accurate diagnosis of MCI and AD and is appropriate for large-scale screening of cognitive impairment. The ICA is unbiased by differences in language, culture, and education.","Kalafatis, Chris; Modarres, Mohammad Hadi; Apostolou, Panos; Marefat, Haniye; Khanbagi, Mahdiyeh; Karimi, Hamed; Vahabi, Zahra; Aarsland, Dag; Khaligh-Razavi, Seyed-Mahdi",Front Psychiatry,555,1

This study aimed to explore whether mainland China will face an epidemic rebound during the Spring Festival holiday, when millions of Chinese people travel across the country, and investigate which nucleic acid testing (NAT) strategy is optimal to contain the epidemic. A microsimulation model was used to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission among railway travelers and evaluated the effects of various NAT strategies. An extended susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model was built to forecast local transmission during the Spring Festival period under different scenarios of testing strategies. The total number of infections, testing burden, and medical expenditure were calculated to devise an optimal strategy during the Spring Festival travel rush. Assuming the daily incidence of 20 per 10 million persons, our model simulated that there would be 97 active infections on the day of travel among 10 million railway passengers without NAT and symptom screening. Pre-travel testing could reduce the number of active infections. Compared with no NAT, testing passengers from risk tier 2–4 regions 3 days before travelling could significantly reduce the risk of transmission, and it is more economical and efficient than testing for all passengers.","Zhou, Yu-Hao; Ma, Ke; Xiao, Peng; Ye, Run-Ze; Zhao, Lin; Cui, Xiao-Ming; Cao, Wu-Chun",Int J Environ Res Public Health,555,21

The cytopathic strains of this virus (cpBVDV) induce dramatic cytoplasmic vacuolization in cell cultures, while infection with the non-cytopathic (NCP-BVDV) strains produces no overt changes in the host cells. Our results show that extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization is the earliest morphological change in response to cpBVDV infection in MDBK cells. Cells with extensive vacuolization showed no co-existing chromatin condensation, caspase activation, or loss of membrane integrity. In addition, the caspase inhibitor (zVAD-fmk), although improving cell viability of infected cells from 6.7±2.2% to 18.8±2.2%, did not prevent vacuolization. On the ultrastructural level, the virus-induced cytoplasmic vacuoles are single membrane structures containing organelles and cellular debris, which appear capable of fusing with other vacuoles and engulfing surrounding cytoplasmic materials. LysoTracker Red which marks lysosomes did not stain the virus-induced cytoplasmic vacuoles. In addition, this lysosomal dye could be observed in the cytoplasm of vacuolized cells, suggesting a lysosomal abnormality. Our data demonstrate that cpBVDV induced a novel cell death pathway in MDBK cells that is primarily associated with lysosomal dysfunction and the formation of phagocytic cytoplasmic vacuoles, and this mode of cell death is different from apoptosis and necrosis.","Birk, Alexander V.; Dubovi, Edward J.; Cohen-Gould, Leona; Donis, Ruben; Szeto, Hazel.

We surveyed UK residents, sampled through users of a rewards-for-exercise app (Sweatcoin; n=749) and an online panel (Prolific; n=907). Of the app users, n=487 further provided daily step-count data collected by the app, prior to, and during the periods of restrictions between March and June 2020. Regression models were applied to investigate factors associated with subjective change (perceived change in physical activity) and objective change (log-percentage change in daily step-count) in physical activity during the periods of restrictions. ANOVAs were used to further investigate the significant factors identified. Key factors associated with a substantial subjective reduction in physical activity included those classed as obese, gym users and people living in urban areas. All participants had a reduced step count during restrictions, with Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups, students and urban dwellers showing the largest reductions.

In darkness, the loss of viability of the virus on stainless steel is temperature dependent, but this is hidden by the effect of the sunlight from the first minutes of exposure. The virus shows a sensitivity to sunlight proportional to the illuminance intensity of the sunlight. The presence of interfering substances has a moderate effect on virus viability even with an elevated illuminance. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly inactivated by simulated sunlight in the presence or absence of high levels of interfering substances at 20°C or 35°C and 50% relative humidity. IMPORTANCE Clinical matrix contains high levels of interfering substances. This study is the first to reveal that the presence of high levels of interfering substances had little impact on the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on stainless steel following exposure to simulated sunlight. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 should be rapidly inactivated in outdoor environments in the presence or absence of interfering substances. Our results indicate that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to occur through outdoor surfaces, dependent on illuminance intensity. Moreover, most studies are interested in lineage S of SARS-CoV-2. In our experiments, we studied the stability of L-type strains, which comprise the majority of strains isolated from worldwide patients. Nevertheless, the effect of sunlight seems to be similar regardless of the strain studied, suggesting that the greater spread of certain variants is not correlated with better survival in outdoor conditions.","Raiteux, Jérémy; Eschlimann, Marine; Marangon, Audrey; Rogée, Sophie; Dadvisard, Maylis; Taysse, Laurent; Larigauderie, Guilhem",Microbiology spectrum,555,16

Field deployable non-invasive sensitive diagnostic techniques are needed to evaluate the infectivity dynamics of the coronavirus in pediatric populations and guide public health interventions. We evaluated the utility of high-throughput Luminex-based assays applied to saliva samples to quantify IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies against five SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) antigens in the context of a contacts and infectivity longitudinal study. We compared the antibody levels obtained in saliva versus serum/plasma samples from a group of children and adults tested weekly by RT-PCR over 35 days and diagnosed as positive (n=58), and a group of children and adults who consistently tested negative over the follow up period (n=61), in the Summer of 2020 in Barcelona, Spain. Antibody levels in saliva samples from individuals with confirmed RT-PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection were significantly higher than in negative individuals and correlated with those measured in sera/plasmas. Higher levels of anti-S IgG were found in asymptomatic individuals that could indicate protection against disease in infected individuals. Higher anti-S IgG and IgM levels in serum/plasma and saliva, respectively, in infected children compared to infected adults could also be related to stronger clinical immunity in them. Among infected children, males had higher levels of saliva IgG to N and RBD than females. Despite overall correlation, individual clustering analysis suggested that responses that may not be detected in blood could be patent in saliva, and vice versa, and therefore that both measurements are complementary. In addition to serum/plasma, measurement of SARS-CoV-2-specific saliva antibodies should be considered as a complementary non-invasive assay to better estimate the percentage of individuals who have experienced coronavirus infection. Saliva antibody detection could allow determining COVID-19 prevalence in pediatric populations, alternative to bleeding or nasal swab, and serological diagnosis following vaccination.","Dobano, C.; Alonso, S.; Vidal, M.; Jimenez, A.; Rubio, R.; Santano, R.; Barrios, D.; Pons Tomas, G.; Mele Casas, M.; Hernandez Garcia, M.; Girona-Alarcon, M.; Puyol, L.; Rodrigo Melero, N.; Carolis, C.; Garcia-Miquel, A.; Bonet-Carne, E.; Claverol, J.; Cubells, M.; Fortuny, C.; Fumado, V.; Codina, A.; Bassat, Q.; Munoz-Almagro, C.; Fernandez de Sevilla, M.; Gratacos, E.; Izquierdo, L.; Garcia-Garcia, J.

Now that the first scientific data from registers, cross-sectional studies, case reports and case series are available, the present update is intended to update the previous recommendations and to add new findings. The current recommendations are based on a literature search of publications available up to 15 June 2020 and address preventive measures (such as hygiene measures or vaccinations) and the use of immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive drugs. An important goal of the current recommendations is also to prevent harm to patients with IRD through unjustified restriction of care.

This study though to compare the times to first review and the time to approval among applications submitted prior to PRIISA.BA and thereafter, across public RECs. All public RECs of the city were invited to participate. Overall, 453 applications from 10 RECs (242 pre- and 211 post-PRIISA.BA) were available for the analyses. There was a decrease in the time to first review and an increase in the time to approval after PRIISA.BA implementation. The increase in time to approval was transient and limited to the first three months. The results were consistent in analyses limited to non-COVID applications. Our results show an increase in the times to approval after the implementation of an electronic system for online submission of health research applications that, although transient, was significant. These data could be relevant to other RECs implementing this technology, since it emphasizes the need of monitoring potential unnecessary delays in reviews during the critical initial period.","Mariani, Javier; Garau, Laura; Ferrero, Fernando; Vukotich, Claudia; Roitman, Adriel J; Serrano, Cecilia M; Perelis, Leonardo; Domínguez, Adriana G; González Villa Monte, Gabriel",Accountability in research,555,20

Older adults are especially likely to develop depressive symptomatology. This study aims to investigate the association between physical activity intensities and sedentary behavior with depression levels among previously active older adults during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: A total of 1,123 physically active older Brazilian adults (67.68 ± 5.91 years, 91.00% female) were interviewed by telephone in regard to sociodemographic, general health status, depression (GDS-15), and physical activity (IPAQ-SV) after being home-confined for 11.59 ± 2.42 weeks. Participants were also asked to self-report changes in their physical activity levels and time spent sitting. Descriptive statistics (mean, frequencies), between-groups comparisons (t-tests and chi-square), and hierarchical regression analysis were used. RESULTS: About 83.80% of older adults self-reported a decrease in daily physical activity levels and 73.90% increased sitting time. Overall, depressive symptoms were observed in 30.40, and 20.80% met physical activity recommendations. Daily moderate (β = −0.174; 95% CI = −0.026; -0.012) and moderate-to-vigorous (β = −0.183; 95% CI = −0.023; 0.011) physical activity intensities were negatively associated with depression score explaining 2.6 and 2.9% of depression variability, respectively, after adjusting for age, gender, education level, body mass index, and polypharmacy. Daily walking and sitting time were not associated with the depression score (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results provide empiric suggestion supporting moderate to vigorous physical activity as a way to reduce depressive levels among older adults during COVID-19 confinement. Supervised home-based exercise programs, specifically designed for older adults, might be an important strategy to maintain and improve older adults’ mental health.","Lage, Ana; Carrapatoso, Susana; Sampaio de Queiroz Neto, Elzier; Gomes, Sérgio; Soares-Miranda, Luísa; Bohn, Lucimere",Front Psychol,555,16

However, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a common comorbidity that has rarely been investigated in detail. This study aims to describe clinical characteristics and determine risk factors for intensive care unit (ICU) admission of COVID-19 patients with CVD. In this retrospective cohort study, we included 288 adult patients with COVID-19 in Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital from January 15, 2020 to March 10, 2020. Demographic characteristics, laboratory results, radiographic findings, complications, and treatments were recorded and compared between CVD and non-CVD groups. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify risk factors associated with ICU admission for infected patients with underlying CVD. COVID-19 patients in the CVD group were older and had higher levels of troponin I (TnI), C-reactive protein (CRP), and creatinine. They were also more prone to develop into severe or critically severe cases, receive ICU admission, and require respiratory support treatment. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the following were risk factors for ICU admission in COVID-19 patients with CVD: each 1-year increase in age (odds ratio (OR), 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.17; p = 0.018); respiratory rate over 24 times per min (OR, 25.52; 95% CI, 5.48-118.87; p < 0.0001); CRP higher than 10 mg/L (OR, 8.12; 95% CI, 1.63-40.49; p = 0.011); and TnI higher than 0.03 μg/L (OR, 9.14; 95% CI, 2.66-31.43; p < 0.0001). Older age, CRP greater than 10 mg/L, TnI higher than 0.03 μg/L, and respiratory rate over 24 times per minute were associated with increasing odds of ICU admission in COVID-19 patients with CVD. Investigating and monitoring these factors could assist in the risk stratification of COVID-19 patients with CVD at an early stage.","He, Feng; Quan, Yibo; Lei, Ming; Liu, Riguang; Qin, Shuguang; Zeng, Jun; Zhao, Ziwen; Yu, Na; Yang, Liuping; Cao, Jie",Aging Dis,555,21
