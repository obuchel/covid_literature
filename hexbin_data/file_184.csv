444,444,444,Situational Awareness and Health Protective Responses to Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) in Hong Kong: A Cross-Sectional Study,21.452887,5.714034,2010-10-12,"BACKGROUND: Whether information sources influence health protective behaviours during influenza pandemics or other emerging infectious disease epidemics is uncertain. METHODOLOGY: Data from cross-sectional telephone interviews of 1,001 Hong Kong adults in June, 2009 were tested against theory and data-derived hypothesized associations between trust in (formal/informal) information, understanding, self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility and worry, and hand hygiene and social distancing using Structural Equation Modelling with multigroup comparisons. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Trust in formal (government/media) information about influenza was associated with greater reported understanding of A/H1N1 cause (β = 0.36) and A/H1N1 prevention self-efficacy (β = 0.25), which in turn were associated with more hand hygiene (β = 0.19 and β = 0.23, respectively). Trust in informal (interpersonal) information was negatively associated with perceived personal A/H1N1 susceptibility (β = −0.21), which was negatively associated with perceived self-efficacy (β = −0.42) but positively associated with influenza worry (β = 0.44). Trust in informal information was positively associated with influenza worry (β = 0.16) which was in turn associated with greater social distancing (β = 0.36). Multigroup comparisons showed gender differences regarding paths from trust in formal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, trust in informal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, and understanding of A/H1N1 cause to perceived self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Trust in government/media information was more strongly associated with greater self-efficacy and handwashing, whereas trust in informal information was strongly associated with perceived health threat and avoidance behaviour. Risk communication should consider the effect of gender differences.","Liao, Qiuyan; Cowling, Benjamin; Lam, Wing Tak; Ng, Man Wai; Fielding, Richard",PLoS One,184,17
3858,3858,3858,Use of Big Data and Machine Learning Methods in the Monitoring and Evaluation of Digital Health Programs in India: An Exploratory Protocol,21.19115,5.761306,2019-05-24,"BACKGROUND: Digital health programs, which encompass the subsectors of health information technology, mobile health, electronic health, telehealth, and telemedicine, have the potential to generate “big data.” OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to evaluate two digital health programs in India—the maternal mobile messaging service (Kilkari) and the mobile training resource for frontline health workers (Mobile Academy). We illustrate possible applications of machine learning for public health practitioners that can be applied to generate evidence on program effectiveness and improve implementation. Kilkari is an outbound service that delivers weekly gestational age–appropriate audio messages about pregnancy, childbirth, and childcare directly to families on their mobile phones, starting from the second trimester of pregnancy until the child is one year old. Mobile Academy is an Interactive Voice Response audio training course for accredited social health activists (ASHAs) in India. METHODS: Study participants include pregnant and postpartum women (Kilkari) as well as frontline health workers (Mobile Academy) across 13 states in India. Data elements are drawn from system-generated databases used in the routine implementation of programs to provide users with health information. We explain the structure and elements of the extracted data and the proposed process for their linkage. We then outline the various steps to be undertaken to evaluate and select final algorithms for identifying gaps in data quality, poor user performance, predictors for call receipt, user listening levels, and linkages between early listening and continued engagement. RESULTS: The project has obtained the necessary approvals for the use of data in accordance with global standards for handling personal data. The results are expected to be published in August/September 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Rigorous evaluations of digital health programs are limited, and few have included applications of machine learning. By describing the steps to be undertaken in the application of machine learning approaches to the analysis of routine system-generated data, we aim to demystify the use of machine learning not only in evaluating digital health education programs but in improving their performance. Where articles on analysis offer an explanation of the final model selected, here we aim to emphasize the process, thereby illustrating to program implementors and evaluators with limited exposure to machine learning its relevance and potential use within the context of broader program implementation and evaluation.

The effects of ETT-CPAP trial on their diaphragmatic activity (Edi) and breathing variability is unknown. METHODS: Prospective observational study enrolling infants with birth weight ≤1250 g undergoing their first extubation attempt. Diaphragmatic activity, expressed as the absolute minimum (Edi min) and maximum values (Edi max), area under the Edi signal, and breath-by-breath analyses for breath areas, amplitudes, widths, and neural inspiratory and expiratory times, were analyzed during mechanical ventilation (MV) and ETT-CPAP. Neural breathing variability of each of these parameters was also calculated and compared between MV and ETT-CPAP. RESULTS: Thirteen infants with median (interquartile range) birth weight of 800 g [610–920] and gestational age of 25.4 weeks [24.4–26.3] were included. Diaphragmatic activity significantly increased during ETT-CPAP when compared to MV:Edi max (44.2 vs. 38.1 μV), breath area (449 vs. 312 μV·s), and amplitude (10.12 vs. 7.46 μV). Neural breathing variability during ETT-CPAP was characterized by increased variability for amplitude and area under the breath, and decreased for breath time and width. CONCLUSIONS: A 5-min ETT-CPAP in extremely preterm infants undergoing extubation imposed significant respiratory load with changes in respiratory variability. IMPACT: ETT-CPAP trials are often used to assess extubation readiness in extremely preterm infants, but its effects upon their respiratory system are not well known. Diaphragmatic activity analysis demonstrated that these infants are able to mount an important response to a short trial. A 5-min trial imposed a significant respiratory load evidenced by increased diaphragmatic activity and changes in breathing variability. Differences in breathing variability were observed between successful and failed extubations, which should be explored further in extubation readiness investigations. This type of trial cannot be recommended for preterm infants in clinical practice until clear standards and accuracy are established.","Latremouille, Samantha; Bhuller, Monica; Rao, Smita; Shalish, Wissam; Sant’Anna, Guilherme",Pediatr Res,184,30

Resorption is accomplished by osteoclasts and their generation may depend on an interaction with the cells in direct contact with the root, the cementoblasts. Our study aimed to investigate the role of human cementoblasts in the formation of osteoclasts and the effect of interleukin (IL)-1β hereupon. Extracted teeth from healthy volunteers were subjected to sequential digestion by type I collagenase and trypsin. The effect of enzymatic digestion on the presence of cells on the root surface was analyzed by histology. Gene expression of primary human cementoblasts (pHCB) was compared with a human cementoblast cell line (HCEM). The pHCBs were analyzed for their expression of IL-1 receptors as well as of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). In a co-culture system consisting of osteoclast precursors (blood monocytes) and pHCBs, the formation of osteoclasts and their resorptive activity was assessed by osteo-assay and ivory slices. The cells obtained after a 120 min enzyme digestion expressed the highest level of bone sialoprotein, similar to that of HCEM. This fraction of isolated cells also shared a similar expression pattern of IL-1 receptors (IL1-R1 and IL1-R2). Treatment with IL-1β potently upregulated RANKL expression but not of OPG. pHCBs were shown to induce the formation of functional osteoclasts. This capacity was significantly stimulated by pretreating the pHCBs with IL-1β prior to their co-culture with human blood monocytes. Our study demonstrated that cementoblasts have the capacity to induce osteoclastogenesis, a capacity strongly promoted by IL-1β. These results may explain why osteoclasts can be formed next to the root of teeth.","Huynh, Nam C-N; Everts, Vincent; Pavasant, Prasit; Ampornaramveth, Ruchanee S",Int J Oral Sci,184,17

However, uncontrolled TLR activation can lead to severe inflammatory disorders such as septic shock. The molecular mechanisms through which TLR responses are regulated are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate an essential function of S100A10 in TLR signaling. S100A10 was constitutively expressed in macrophages, but was significantly downregulated upon TLR activation. S100A10-deficient macrophages were hyperresponsive to TLR stimulation, and S100A10-deficient mice were more sensitive to endotoxin-induced lethal shock and Escherichia coli-induced abdominal sepsis. Mechanistically, S100A10 regulated macrophage inflammatory responses by interfering with the appropriate recruitment and activation of the receptor-proximal signaling components and eventually inhibited TLR-triggered downstream signaling. These findings expand our understanding of TLR signaling and establish S100A10 as an essential negative regulator of TLR function and a potential therapeutic target for treating inflammatory diseases.","Lou, Yunwei; Han, Meijuan; Liu, Huandi; Niu, Yuna; Liang, Yinming; Guo, Jiqiang; Zhang, Wen; Wang, Hui",Cell Mol Immunol,184,17

Other aspects of muscle function such as force control, fatigability, and steadiness are unaccounted for in current HGS protocols. This pilot study sought to determine the role of maximal HGS, submaximal HGS force control, HGS fatigability, and HGS neuromuscular steadiness on cognitive function in older adults. Our findings indicate that these additional HGS measurements could factor into detecting poorer cognitive functioning, while also evolving HGS protocols.","Klawitter, Lukus; Mahoney, Sean J.; Dahl, Lindsey; Hackney, Kyle J.; Herrmann, Stephen D.; Edwards, Bradley; McGrath, Ryan",,184,17

While making all efforts to improve independent living skills, daily living activities, and quality of life as a whole for people living visual disabilities, vision rehabilitation is an indispensable component. There is no single appropriate low vision and rehabilitation model implementable at health care institutions in the country to cover these fundamental aspects of a visually impaired individual. We did a literature review to know the existing practices of low vision and various disability models. The purpose of the review is to discern any pitfalls and shortcomings in managing visually disabled in India and to underpin the credibility and feasibility as well as suitability of the developed model. The review was done using search key terms low vision, current practices, visual disability, disability models, vision rehabilitation, and service delivery. Therefore, the article discusses the development of an inclusive low vision management model name as “Clinico-Social Model”, which we consider the most appropriate for the best management of people with vision loss. The primary aim of this model is to provide both clinical and vision rehabilitation components of management for people with visual disabilities. Such an approach is likely to have the potential to improve the quality of life of people with vision loss and can provide practical guide to eye care managers across India. Given the specific context in the current practices of low vision in India, it is desirable to design a similar model to care for the visually disabled.","Senjam, Suraj S",Indian J Ophthalmol,184,17

Qidengmingmu Capsule (QC) is a Chinese patent medicine used to treat DR, but the molecular mechanism of the treatment remains unknown. In this study, we identified and validated potential molecular mechanisms involved in the treatment of DR with QC via network pharmacology and molecular docking methods. The results of Ingredient-DR Target Network showed that 134 common targets and 20 active ingredients of QC were involved. According to the results of enrichment analysis, 2307 biological processes and 40 pathways were related to the treatment effects. Most of these processes and pathways were important for cell survival and were associated with many key factors in DR, such as vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA), hypoxia-inducible factor-1A (HIF-1Α), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Based on the results of the PPI network and KEGG enrichment analyses, we selected AKT1, HIF-1α, VEGFA, TNFα and their corresponding active ingredients for molecular docking. According to the molecular docking results, several key targets of DR (including AKT1, HIF-1α, VEGFA, and TNFα) can form stable bonds with the corresponding active ingredients of QC. In conclusion, through network pharmacology methods, we found that potential biological mechanisms involved in the alleviation of DR by QC are related to multiple biological processes and signaling pathways. The molecular docking results also provide us with sound directions for further experiments.","Zhang, Mingxu; Yang, Jiawei; Zhao, Xiulan; Zhao, Ying; Zhu, Siquan",Sci Rep,184,17

Immune checkpoint (IC) molecules are expressed on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and promote T cell exhaustion upon binding to IC ligands expressed by the tumor cells. Interfering with IC pathways with immunotherapy has promoted reactivation of anti-tumor immunity and led to success in several malignancies. However, IC inhibitors have achieved limited success in GBM patients, suggesting that other checkpoint molecules may be involved with suppressing TIL responses. Numerous IC pathways have been described, with current testing of inhibitors underway in multiple clinical trials. Identification of the most promising checkpoint pathways may be useful to guide the future trials for GBM. Here, we analyzed the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) transcriptomic database and identified PD1 and TIGIT as top putative targets for GBM immunotherapy. Additionally, dual blockade of PD1 and TIGIT improved survival and augmented CD8(+) TIL accumulation and functions in a murine GBM model compared with either single agent alone. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this combination immunotherapy affected granulocytic/polymorphonuclear (PMN) myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) but not monocytic (Mo) MDSCs in in our murine gliomas. Importantly, we showed that suppressive myeloid cells express PD1, PD-L1, and TIGIT-ligands in human GBM tissue, and demonstrated that antigen specific T cell proliferation that is inhibited by immunosuppressive myeloid cells can be restored by TIGIT/PD1 blockade. Our data provide new insights into mechanisms of GBM αPD1/αTIGIT immunotherapy.","Raphael, Itay; Kumar, Rajeev; McCarl, Lauren H.; Shoger, Karsen; Wang, Lin; Sandlesh, Poorva; Sneiderman, Chaim T.; Allen, Jordan; Zhai, Shuyan; Campagna, Marissa Lynn; Foster, Alexandra; Bruno, Tullia C.; Agnihotri, Sameer; Hu, Baoli; Castro, Brandyn A.; Lieberman, Frank S.; Broniscer, Alberto; Diaz, Aaron A.; Amankulor, Nduka M.; Rajasundaram, Dhivyaa; Pollack, Ian F.; Kohanbash, Gary",Front Immunol,184,17

Traditional in vivo studies used to characterize clinical candidate’s volume of distribution are error-prone, time- and cost-intensive and lack reproducibility in clinical settings. The paper demonstrates how a computational platform integrating machine learning optimization with mechanistic modeling can be used to simulate compound plasma concentration profile and predict tissue-plasma partition coefficients with high accuracy by varying the lipophilicity descriptor logP. The approach applied to chemically diverse small molecules resulted in comparable geometric mean fold-errors of 1.50 and 1.63 in pharmacokinetic outputs for direct tissue:plasma partition and hybrid logP optimization, with the latter enabling prediction of tissue permeation that can be used to guide toxicity and efficacy dosing in human subjects. The optimization simulations required to achieve these results were parallelized on the AWS cloud and generated outputs in under 5 h. Accuracy, speed, and scalability of the framework indicate that it can be used to assess the relevance of other mechanistic relationships implicated in pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic phenomena with a lower risk of overfitting datasets and generate large database of physiologically-relevant drug disposition for further integration with machine learning models.","Antontsev, Victor; Jagarapu, Aditya; Bundey, Yogesh; Hou, Hypatia; Khotimchenko, Maksim; Walsh, Jason; Varshney, Jyotika",Sci Rep,184,17

CDC recommends vaccinations for adults on the basis of age, health conditions, prior vaccinations, and other considerations. Updated vaccination recommendations from CDC are published annually in the U.S. Adult Immunization Schedule. Despite longstanding recommendations for use of many vaccines, vaccination coverage among U.S. adults remains low. REPORTING PERIOD: August 2017–June 2018 (for influenza vaccination) and January–December 2018 (for pneumococcal, herpes zoster, tetanus and diphtheria [Td]/tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis [Tdap], hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and human papillomavirus [HPV] vaccination). DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a continuous, cross-sectional national household survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population. In-person interviews are conducted throughout the year in a probability sample of households, and NHIS data are compiled and released annually. NHIS’s objective is to monitor the health of the U.S. population and provide estimates of health indicators, health care use and access, and health-related behaviors. Adult receipt of influenza, pneumococcal, herpes zoster, Td/Tdap, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and at least 1 dose of HPV vaccines was assessed. Estimates were derived for a new composite adult vaccination quality measure and by selected demographic and access-to-care characteristics (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, indication for vaccination, travel history [travel to countries where hepatitis infections are endemic], health insurance status, contacts with physicians, nativity, and citizenship). Trends in adult vaccination were assessed during 2010−2018. RESULTS: Coverage for the adult age-appropriate composite measure was low in all age groups. Racial and ethnic differences in coverage persisted for all vaccinations, with lower coverage for most vaccinations among non-White compared with non-Hispanic White adults. Linear trend tests indicated coverage increased from 2010 to 2018 for most vaccines in this report. Few adults aged ≥19 years had received all age-appropriate vaccines, including influenza vaccination, regardless of whether inclusion of Tdap (13.5%) or inclusion of any tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine (20.2%) receipt was measured. Coverage among adults for influenza vaccination during the 2017−18 season (46.1%) was similar to the estimate for the 2016−17 season (45.4%), and coverage for pneumococcal (adults aged ≥65 years [69.0%]), herpes zoster (adults aged ≥50 years and aged ≥60 years [24.1% and 34.5%, respectively]), tetanus (adults aged ≥19 years [62.9%]), Tdap (adults aged ≥19 years [31.2%]), hepatitis A (adults aged ≥19 years [11.9%]), and HPV (females aged 19–26 years [52.8%]) vaccination in 2018 were similar to the estimates for 2017. Hepatitis B vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥19 years and health care personnel (HCP) aged ≥19 years increased 4.2 and 6.7 percentage points to 30.0% and 67.2%, respectively, from 2017. HPV vaccination coverage among males aged 19–26 years increased 5.2 percentage points to 26.3% from the 2017 estimate. Overall, HPV vaccination coverage among females aged 19–26 years did not increase, but coverage among Hispanic females aged 19–26 years increased 10.8 percentage points to 49.6% from the 2017 estimate. Coverage for the following vaccines was lower among adults without health insurance compared with those with health insurance: influenza vaccine (among adults aged ≥19 years, 19–49 years, and 50–64 years), pneumococcal vaccine (among adults aged 19–64 years at increased risk), Td vaccine (among all age groups), Tdap vaccine (among adults aged ≥19 years and 19–64 years), hepatitis A vaccine (among adults aged ≥19 years overall and among travelers aged ≥19 years), hepatitis B vaccine (among adults aged ≥19 years and 19–49 years and among travelers aged ≥19 years), herpes zoster vaccine (among adults aged ≥60 years), and HPV vaccine (among males and females aged 19–26 years). Adults who reported having a usual place for health care generally reported receipt of recommended vaccinations more often than those who did not have such a place, regardless of whether they had health insurance. Vaccination coverage was higher among adults reporting ≥1 physician contact during the preceding year compared with those who had not visited a physician during the preceding year, regardless of whether they had health insurance. Even among adults who had health insurance and ≥10 physician contacts during the preceding year, depending on the vaccine, 20.1%–87.5% reported not having received vaccinations that were recommended either for all persons or for those with specific indications. Overall, vaccination coverage among U.S.-born adults was significantly higher than that of foreign-born adults, including influenza vaccination (aged ≥19 years), pneumococcal vaccination (all ages), tetanus vaccination (all ages), Tdap vaccination (all ages), hepatitis B vaccination (aged ≥19 years and 19–49 years and travelers aged ≥19 years), herpes zoster vaccination (all ages), and HPV vaccination among females aged 19–26 years. Vaccination coverage also varied by citizenship status and years living in the United States. INTERPRETATION: NHIS data indicate that many adults remain unprotected against vaccine-preventable diseases. Coverage for the adult age-appropriate composite measures was low in all age groups. Individual adult vaccination coverage remained low as well, but modest gains occurred in vaccination coverage for hepatitis B (among adults aged ≥19 years and HCP aged ≥19 years), and HPV (among males aged 19–26 years and Hispanic females aged 19–26 years). Coverage for other vaccines and groups with Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices vaccination indications did not improve from 2017. Although HPV vaccination coverage among males aged 19–26 years and Hispanic females aged 19–26 years increased, approximately 50% of females aged 19–26 years and 70% of males aged 19–26 years remained unvaccinated. Racial/ethnic vaccination differences persisted for routinely recommended adult vaccines. Having health insurance coverage, having a usual place for health care, and having ≥1 physician contacts during the preceding 12 months were associated with higher vaccination coverage; however, these factors alone were not associated with optimal adult vaccination coverage, and findings indicate missed opportunities to vaccinate remained. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: Substantial improvement in adult vaccination uptake is needed to reduce the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases. Following the Standards for Adult Immunization Practice (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/adults/for-practice/standards/index.html), all providers should routinely assess adults’ vaccination status at every clinical encounter, strongly recommend appropriate vaccines, either offer needed vaccines or refer their patients to another provider who can administer the needed vaccines, and document vaccinations received by their patients in an immunization information system.","Lu, Peng-Jun; Hung, Mei-Chuan; Srivastav, Anup; Grohskopf, Lisa A.; Kobayashi, Miwako; Harris, Aaron M.; Dooling, Kathleen L.; Markowitz, Lauri E.; Rodriguez-Lainz, Alfonso; Williams, Walter W.",MMWR Surveill Summ,184,5

Human proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTECs) undergo pathological and fibrotic changes seen in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in response to elevated glucose. We developed a specific in vitro model of DKD using primary human PTECs with exposure to high D-glucose and TGF-β1 and propose a role for SGLT2 inhibition in regulating fibrosis. Methods: Western blotting was performed to detect cellular and secreted proteins as well as phosphorylated intracellular signalling proteins. qPCR was used to detect CCN2 RNA. Gamma glutamyl transferase (GT) activity staining was performed to confirm PTEC phenotype. SGLT2 and ERK inhibition on high D-glucose, 25 mM, and TGF-β1, 0.75 ng/ml, treated cells was explored using dapagliflozin and U0126, respectively. Results: Only the combination of high D-glucose and TGF-β1 treatment significantly up-regulated CCN2 RNA and protein expression. This increase was significantly ameliorated by dapagliflozin. High D-glucose treatment raised phospho ERK which was also inhibited by dapagliflozin. TGF-β1 increased cellular phospho SSXS Smad3 serine 423 and 425, with and without high D-glucose. Glucose alone had no effect. Smad3 serine 204 phosphorylation was significantly raised by a combination of high D-glucose+TGF-β1; this rise was significantly reduced by both SGLT2 and MEK inhibition. Conclusions: We show that high D-glucose and TGF-β1 are both required for CCN2 expression. This treatment also caused Smad3 linker region phosphorylation. Both outcomes were inhibited by dapagliflozin. We have identified a novel SGLT2 -ERK mediated promotion of TGF-β1/Smad3 signalling inducing a pro-fibrotic growth factor secretion.

An increasing body of evidence from randomized clinical trials and real-world data suggest that rituximab is a highly effective alternative in both relapsing and progressive MS, with a low discontinuation rate, related to a good benefit/risk profile, and a good compliance. To date, the use of rituximab in patients with multiple sclerosis is not in accordance with the authorized product information (off-label use). However, the use of this medicine is widespread in several countries, and in some cases, it is the most commonly used disease-modifying drug for MS subtypes. This use could be officially recognized by national regulatory authorities, according to specific procedures, to ensure equal access for patients to a safe and effective option.","Brancati, Serena; Gozzo, Lucia; Longo, Laura; Vitale, Daniela Cristina; Drago, Filippo",Front Immunol,184,17

Oncology has proved to be a prototypical example, and wearables offer immediate benefits to patients and oncologists with the ability to track symptoms and health metrics in real time. We aimed to review the recent literature on consumer-grade wearables and its current applications in cancer from the perspective of both the patient and the provider. The relevant studies suggested that these devices offer benefits, such as improved medication adherence and accuracy of symptom tracking over self-reported data, as well as insights that increase patient empowerment. Physical activity is consistently correlated with stronger patient outcomes, and a patient’s real-time metrics were found to be capable of tracking medication side effects and toxicity. Studies have made associations between wearable data and telomere shortening, cardiovascular disease, alcohol consumption, sleep apnea, and other conditions. The objective data obtained by the wearable presents a more complete picture of an individual’s health than the snapshot of a 15-minute office visit and a single set of vital signs. Real-time metrics can be translated into a digital phenotype that identifies risk factors specific to each patient, and shared risk factors across one’s social network may uncover common environmental exposures detrimental to one’s health. Wearable data and its upcoming integration with social media will be the foundation for the next generation of personalized medicine.","Fonseka, Lakshan N; Woo, Benjamin KP",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,184,22

A 2-year pragmatic clinical trial (PCORI PCS-1504-30472) that enrolled 1100 individuals with serious mental illness in the greater Boston area was conducted to test 2 interventions for tobacco cessation for individuals with serious mental illness: (1) academic detailing, which delivers education to primary care providers and highlights first-line pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation, and (2) provision of community health worker support to smoker participants. Implementing and scaling this intervention in other settings will require the systematic identification of barriers and facilitators, as well as the identification of relevant subgroups, effective and unique components, and setting-specific factors. OBJECTIVE: This protocol outlines the proposed mixed methods evaluation of the pragmatic clinical trial to (1) identify barriers and facilitators to effective implementation of the interventions, (2) examine group differences among primary care physicians, and (3) identify barriers that stakeholders such as clinical, payor, and policy leaders would anticipate to impact the implementation of effective components of the intervention. METHODS: Qualitative interviews will be conducted with all study community health workers and selected smoker participants, primary care providers, and other stakeholders. Measures of performance and engagement will guide purposive sampling. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research will guide qualitative data collection and analysis in accordance with the following framework approach: (1) familiarization, (2) identifying a thematic framework, (3) indexing, (4) charting, and (5) mapping and interpretation. Joint display analyses will be constructed to analyze and draw conclusions across the quantitative and qualitative data. RESULTS: The 3-year cluster-randomized trial has concluded, and the analysis of primary outcomes is underway. Results from the pragmatic trial and this mixed methods implementation evaluation will be used to help disseminate, scale, and expand a systems intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this mixed methods implementation evaluation will inform strategies for dissemination and solutions to potential barriers to the implementation of interventions from a smoking cessation trial for individuals with serious mental illness.

Young people are more vulnerable to substance use than older people. Substance use has varying impacts on the health and socio-economics of countries, and is a major public health concern globally. Currently, substance use is a common public health concern among the youth of Ethiopia, mainly in Jimma town. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the substance use and risk factors among the youth of Jimma town in 2019. METHODS: The study was conducted in Jimma town among youth who were engaged in substance use, from March to April 2019. A descriptive qualitative study design was employed and the study participants were acquired using purposive/judgmental sampling techniques. In total, 20 interviews were conducted with young people using in-depth and key informant interview methods. The data were analyzed by using ATLAS.ti version 7. Thematic analyses were performed in order to extract the main themes and categories. Direct quotations were presented with a thick description of the findings. RESULTS: The findings of this study were discussed under six themes and 12 categories, which emerged from thematic analysis of the data: substance use setting, time and means of distribution, substance-related factors, social and economic factors, individual factors, psychological factors, and legal and policy factors. CONCLUSION: The study indicated that khat, alcohol, cigarettes and shisha or water pipes were the most commonly used substances. Different factors that drive the youth to engage in substance use were identified; individual factors, social and economic factors, substance-related factors, and legal and policy factors were most common. Generally, to overcome this problem, the community, lawyers, and policemen should participate in the implementation and enforcement of rules and regulations on substance use. Family should monitor their children and need to act as good role models by avoiding substance use.","Geleta, Tinsae Abeya; Amdisa, Demuma; Gizaw, Abraham Tamirat; Tilahun, Dejene",Subst Abuse Rehabil,184,1

This paper contends that it is important to embrace complexity in full, conceptually and practically, by shifting from ‘the global’ to ‘the local’, to understand the pressure of transformational change and to prepare the ground for the emergence of more resilient and cooperative orders. We apply this complexity-thinking, using a 3P analysis, to Central Eurasia, presently a battleground of three competing order-making regimes—the EU, China and Russia. We argue that for more resilient and cooperative orders to emerge, it is essential to understand and enable ‘the local’ and embrace the region in is diversity, to facilitate a more joined-up and bottom-up governance in managing the complexity of a changing world.","Korosteleva, Elena A.; Petrova, Irina",Int Polit,184,16

Jointly, they fulfill a wide range of functions including the protection of the epithelial layer. In this study, we simultaneously analyzed the epithelial tissue and the secreted mucus response using a holistic interactome-based multi-omics approach. The effect of the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) skin mucosa to a dietary inclusion of spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) was evaluated. The epithelial skin microarrays-based transcriptome data showed 194 differentially expressed genes, meanwhile the exuded mucus proteome analysis 35 differentially synthesized proteins. Separately, the skin transcripteractome revealed an expression profile that favored biological mechanisms associated to gene expression, biogenesis, vesicle function, protein transport and localization to the membrane. Mucus proteome showed an enhanced protective role with putatively higher antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. The integrated skin mucosa multi-interactome analysis evidenced the interrelationship and synergy between the metabolism and the exuded mucus functions improving specifically the tissue development, innate defenses, and environment recognition. Histologically, the skin increased in thickness and in number of mucous cells. A positive impact on animal performance, growth and feed efficiency was also registered. Collectively, the results suggest an intimate crosstalk between skin tissue and its exuded mucus in response to the nutritional stimulus (SDPP supplementation) that favors the stimulation of cell protein turnover and the activation of the exudation machinery in the skin mucosa. Thus, the multi-omics-based interactome analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the biological context of response that takes place in a mucosal tissue. In perspective, this strategy is applicable for evaluating the effect of any experimental variable on any mucosal tissue functionality, including the benefits this assessment may provide on the study of the mammalian mucosa.","Reyes-López, Felipe E.; Ibarz, Antoni; Ordóñez-Grande, Borja; Vallejos-Vidal, Eva; Andree, Karl B.; Balasch, Joan Carles; Fernández-Alacid, Laura; Sanahuja, Ignasi; Sánchez-Nuño, Sergio; Firmino, Joana P.; Pavez, Leonardo; Polo, Javier; Tort, Lluis; Gisbert, Enric",Front Immunol,184,1

Objective To determine the efficacy of 5 or 10 days of remdesivir treatment compared with standard care on clinical status on day 11 after initiation of treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized, open-label trial of hospitalized patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and moderate COVID-19 pneumonia (pulmonary infiltrates and room-air oxygen saturation >94%) enrolled from March 15 through April 18, 2020, at 105 hospitals in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The date of final follow-up was May 20, 2020. Interventions Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a 10-day course of remdesivir (n = 197), a 5-day course of remdesivir (n = 199), or standard care (n = 200). Remdesivir was dosed intravenously at 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg/d. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was clinical status on day 11 on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from death (category 1) to discharged (category 7). Differences between remdesivir treatment groups and standard care were calculated using proportional odds models and expressed as odds ratios. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates difference in clinical status distribution toward category 7 for the remdesivir group vs the standard care group. Results Among 596 patients who were randomized, 584 began the study and received remdesivir or continued standard care (median age, 57 [interquartile range, 46-66] years; 227 [39%] women; 56% had cardiovascular disease, 42% hypertension, and 40% diabetes), and 533 (91%) completed the trial. Median length of treatment was 5 days for patients in the 5-day remdesivir group and 6 days for patients in the 10-day remdesivir group. On day 11, patients in the 5-day remdesivir group had statistically significantly higher odds of a better clinical status distribution than those receiving standard care (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.09-2.48; P = .02). The clinical status distribution on day 11 between the 10-day remdesivir and standard care groups was not significantly different (P = .18 by Wilcoxon rank sum test). By day 28, 9 patients had died: 2 (1%) in the 5-day remdesivir group, 3 (2%) in the 10-day remdesivir group, and 4 (2%) in the standard care group. Nausea (10% vs 3%), hypokalemia (6% vs 2%), and headache (5% vs 3%) were more frequent among remdesivir-treated patients compared with standard care. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with moderate COVID-19, those randomized to a 10-day course of remdesivir did not have a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care at 11 days after initiation of treatment. Patients randomized to a 5-day course of remdesivir had a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care, but the difference was of uncertain clinical importance.

During the encryption, dimension coordination optimization is adopted, which effectively reduces the time cost of the system and improves the encryption efficiency by 3 times. At the same time, probabilistic shaping (PS) technology is used to further optimize the system that has effectively improved the bit error performance by about 1 dB. The proposed encryption technique for OFDM-PON has been demonstrated successfully with the help of experiments. The generated OFDM signal is modulated by the quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) technique, which transmitted 16 Gb/s data rate across a 25 km fiber span of standard single-mode fiber. The values of bit error rate (BER) and peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) are analyzed during the experiments, and the obtained results show that the proposed security-enhanced OFDM-PON has high sensitivity and security and can be well compatible with PS and OFDM technologies.

Diagnosis and subsequent treatment are discussed and the literature on the origin, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of ovary lymphoma are reviewed. All patients were diagnosed as having DLBCL after ovary biopsy, and were subsequently given regular chemotherapy. Two of them obtained remission and 1 of them had central nervous system involvement. CONCLUSIONS Ovary involvement of DLBCL is rare; prognosis is related to the overall clinical manifestation and some serum biomarkers. Diagnosis is established by ovary biopsy. Inaccurate or delayed diagnosis is often due to the lesions presenting as a mass resembling ovary cancer and may lead to poor outcome. Treatment regimen mainly consists of chemotherapy (CHOP) associated with rituximab. Intrathecal chemotherapy may play an important role in prevention of central nervous system involvement.","Hu, Rong; Miao, Miao; Zhang, Rong; Li, Yingchun; Li, Jia; Zhu, Ke; Yang, Ying; Liu, Zhuogang; Yang, Wei",The American journal of case reports,184,16

Infection with EBOV causes a high mortality rate and currently there is no FDA-licensed vaccine or therapeutic treatment available.

We tested the effect of several different Hsp90 inhibitors including geldanamycin, radicicol, and 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG; a geldanamycin analog) on the replication of Zaire EBOV. Our results showed that inhibition of Hsp90 significantly reduced the replication of EBOV. Classic Hsp90 inhibitors reduced viral replication with an effective concentration at 50% (EC(50)) in the high nanomolar to low micromolar range, while drugs from a new class of Hsp90 inhibitors showed markedly more potent inhibition. These compounds blocked EBOV replication with an EC(50) in the low nanomolar range and showed significant potency in blocking replication in primary human monocytes. These results validated that Hsp90 is an important host factor for the replication of filoviruses and suggest that Hsp90 inhibitors may be therapeutically effective in treating EBOV infection.","Smith, Darci R; McCarthy, Sarah; Chrovian, Andrew; Olinger, Gene; Stossel, Andrea; Geisbert, Thomas W; Hensley, Lisa E; Connor, John H",Antiviral research,184,1

In this article the authors describe a modified technique of laparoscopic feeding jejunostomy applied during the staging laparoscopy. A 48-year-old male patient with gastroesophageal junction tumour and a 68-year-old male patient with oesophageal tumour were operated on using the described technique. Exploratory laparoscopy was performed. Then the feeding jejunostomy was made using a Cystofix(®) TUR catheter. The jejunum was fixed to the abdominal wall with four 2.0 Novafil™ transabdominal stitches. Two additional sutures were placed caudally about 4 cm and 8 cm from the jejunostomy, aiming at prevention of jejunal torsion. Total operating time was 45 min. There was no blood loss. There were no intraoperative complications. The only adverse event was one jejunostomy wound infection that responded well to oral antibiotics. There were no mortalities. The described technique has most of the benefits of laparoscopic feeding jejunostomy with some steps added from the open operation making the procedure easier to perform as part of a staging operation with a relatively short additional operating time. The proposed transabdominal stitches make the technique easier to apply. Two additional 'anti-torsion sutures' prevent postoperative volvulus. Use of the Cystofix catheter allows easy introduction of the catheter into the peritoneal cavity and the jejunal lumen, providing a good seal at the same time. Further studies on larger groups of patients are required to assess long-term outcomes of the proposed modified technique.","Bobowicz, Maciej; Makarewicz, Wojciech; Polec, Tomasz; Kopiejć, Arkadiusz; Jastrzębski, Tomasz; Zieliński, Jacek; Jaśkiewicz, Janusz",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,184,5

METHODS From October 2018 to February 2020, we conducted this in-person survey study, enrolling similar numbers of UDLI, LCR and NLCR patients at two urban county hospital emergency departments (EDs) in San Francisco and Oakland, California. Our primary outcomes were responses to key survey questions regarding crime victimization, fear of reporting crimes and the effects of anti-immigrant rhetoric on reporting crimes. RESULTS Of 667 patients approached, 531 (80%) participated and six participants were excluded: 165 (31.3%) were UDLI, 183 (34.7%) were LCR, and 177 (33.6%) were NLCR. Similar percentages of UDLI (34%), LCR (32%) and NLCR (39%) knew of someone (themselves, friends or family) who was a victim of a crime. Similar percentages of UDLI (41%), LCR (46%), and NLCR (41%) stated that these victims were afraid to report this crime to the police. The primary reason for this fear in UDLI was fear of discovery and deportation (30%). Similar percentages of UDLI (63%), LCR (58%) and NLCR (46%) ultimately reported the crime to the police. Most (85%) respondents had heard the US president's statements about measures against immigrants; 54% reported that they believe that because of these statements, people are more afraid to report a crime to the police. CONCLUSIONS Fear of reporting crimes is common in ED patients. The most common fear in undocumented Latinx immigrants is fear of discovery and deportation. Political rhetoric against immigrants contributes to this fear.","Rodriguez, Robert M; Torres, Jesus R; Sun, Jennifer; Anderson, Erik",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,184,15

Methods This study included 495 lung cancer patients undergoing VATS from March 2018 to November 2018. Patients were randomly assigned to an IPC group or a control group using sealed envelopes containing a slip indicating the allocation. IPC calf sleeves were applied to both legs during the surgery. All patients were subjected to D-dimer and echo color-Doppler detection pre- and postoperatively. The incidences of DVT were compared between the two groups. Results While D-dimer levels failed to show any significant difference between the two groups, the incidence of DVT showed significant difference with respect to the ultrasonographic features of the thrombi. Intraoperative administration of IPC significantly reduced the risk of DVT compared with no mechanical prophylaxis (P<0.0001). No complications related to IPC occurred. Conclusions Intraoperative administration of IPC was effective in preventing postoperative DVT in lung cancer patients undergoing VATS.","Wang, Xiaojun; Song, Saiqi; Ni, Ruijie; Lu, Min; Mao, Yanjun",Journal of thoracic disease,184,10

In contrast to adult PTSD, relatively little is known about the neurobiology of adolescent PTSD, nor about how current treatments may alter adolescent neurodevelopment to allow recovery from PTSD. Improving our understanding of biological mechanisms of adolescent PTSD, taken in the context of neurodevelopment, is crucial for developing novel and personalized treatment approaches. In this review, we highlight prevailing constructs of PTSD and current findings on these domains in adolescent PTSD. Notably, little data exist in adolescent PTSD for prominent adult PTSD constructs, including threat learning and attentional threat bias. Most work to date has examined general threat processing, emotion regulation, and their neural substrates. These studies suggest that adolescent PTSD, while phenomenologically similar to adult PTSD, shows unique neurodevelopmental substrates that may impair recovery but could also be targeted in the context of adolescent neuroplasticity to improve outcomes. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal data suggest abnormal frontolimbic development compared with typically developing youths, a pattern that may differ from resilient youths. Whether current treatments such as trauma-focused psychotherapy engage these targets and restore healthy neurodevelopment remains an open question. We end our review by highlighting emerging areas and knowledge gaps that could be addressed to better characterize the biology underlying adolescent PTSD. Emerging studies in computational modeling of decision making, caregiver-related transmission of traumatic stress, and other areas may offer new targets that could harness adolescent neurobehavioral plasticity to improve resilience and recovery for some of our most vulnerable youths.","Cisler, Josh M; Herringa, Ryan J",Biological psychiatry,184,5

METHODS A retrospective chart review was undertaken to identify non-constrained PIP joint arthroplasties that underwent a subsequent soft tissue hemitenodesis for swan neck deformities. The range of motion (ROM), implant design, preoperative diagnosis, and surgical approach were collected. The Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire and patient satisfaction questionnaire were collected. RESULTS There were 12 patients with 14 procedures reviewed. There were seven surface replacement arthroplasties (SRA) (cobalt chrome on polyethylene) and eight pyrocarbon prostheses. The primary diagnosis for the initial joint arthroplasty was osteoarthritis (8), post-traumatic (2), and rheumatoid arthritis (5). The primary dorsal approach was a longitudinal split in eleven cases, Chamay in two, and unknown in one case. Nine of the 14 revision procedures had a concomitant dorsal approach to the joint. The average final position intraoperatively was 24.2° of flexion (range 15°-40°). Final ROM was 39° with average follow-up of 30 months. The average postoperative radiographic position was 20.3° flexion with an average of 24.8° hyperextension preoperatively. There was one failure secondary to implant loosening requiring fusion. DISCUSSION For patients with a swan neck deformity after PIP arthroplasty, a FDS hemitenodesis provides a treatment option with a low revision rate, retained motion, and maintenance of the original implant with no shortening of the digit.","Froelich, John M; Rizzo, Marco",Hand,184,1

Given the elevated risk of STIs and HIV for African American women, there is an urgent need to identify innovative strategies to enhance adoption and maintenance of STI and HIV preventive behaviors. Texting is a promising technology for creating preventive maintenance interventions (PMIs) that extend the efficacy of the original intervention. However, little guidance in the public health literature is available for developing this type of application. OBJECTIVE We describe a formative pilot study that incorporates user experience (UX) methods to design and test PMI texts for Afiya, an original evidence-based intervention (EBI) specifically designed for African American adolescent females. The purpose of this study is to describe the adaptation process of the health educator-lead phone calling to text-based communication. METHODS The formative process followed the ADAPT-ITT framework for adapting EBI and using them in a new setting, for a new target population, or a modified intervention strategy. This study presents the details of how the phases of the ADAPT-ITT framework were applied to the design of the adaptation. An advisory board (AB) from the target population was constituted, consisting of six African American women ages of 18 - 24 years, participating in formative activities for 12 weeks, involving components of the PMI design. As Afiya included a telephone-based PMI, developers of the original Afiya consultation scripts crafted the initial design of the SMS-based text and texting protocol. The AB participated in the one-day Afiya workshop, followed by 4 weeks of texting PMI messages, a mid-course focus group, followed by 4 more weeks of texting PMI messages, ending with a final focus group. At the advisory board's request, this phase included an optional, additional week of text-based PMI messages. RESULTS The methods provided a rich source of data and insights into the fundamental issue involved when constructing SMS-based PMI for this target population, and for this EBI. Prior contact and context are essential, as the health educator was identified as a key persona in the process and the messages were situated in the original (workshop) context. Narrative adaptations for personas emerged from AB discussions. Suggestions on how to expand the PMI to current, specific social contexts indicated the use of narrative analysis is warranted. CONCLUSIONS The use of existing EBI incorporating telephone-based PMI scripts facilitated the initial design of the texts, with subsequent narrative analysis of the AB data providing additional adjustments given the actual context. Post-analysis revealed that personas would offer insight and opportunities for persona-specific modification of texting narratives.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the determination of catheter tip position (TP) and resolution of TCs in patients with transjugular CDC scheduled into the superior vena cava using high resolution magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (HR-MRCP) and T2-weighted imaging (HR-T2WI). METHODS The study protocol was approved by the local Research Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. In total, 41 consecutively enrolled transjugular CDC patients with suspected catheter dysfunction were scanned with HRMRCP and HR-T2WI. The distance from the top to the tip of the catheter and the presence and nature of catheter TCs were assessed by 2 experienced radiologists. Chest x-ray was taken within 1 to 2 days and CDC was withdrawn within 3 to 10 days from those patients with TCs identified by HR-MRI. RESULTS A total of 38 subjects successfully underwent HR-MRI, including 13 normal and 25 with TCs (fibrin sheath [FS]: n = 21, mural thrombosis [MT]: n = 7, venous thrombosis [VT]: n = 3, intraluminal clots [IC]: n = 4). There was no significant difference between HR-MRCP and chest x-ray in catheter TP determination (P = .124). Normal catheter appeared as ""double eyes"" on HR-T2WI and ""double tracks"" on HR-MRCP. TCs appeared as follows: FS displayed as a ""thin ring"" (<1mm) around the catheter, MT as patchy hyperintensity and VT as a ""thick ring"" (>5mm) on HR-T2WI. Unilateral IC appeared as a ""single eye"" on HR-T2WI and a ""single track"" on HR-MRCP (n = 3). Bilateral IC appeared as neither ""eye"" nor ""track"" (n = 1). Catheter withdrawal confirmed FS (n = 16), MT (n = 6), VT (n = 1), and IC (n = 4). CONCLUSION HR-MRCP and HR-T2WI are promising methods for visualizing TP and TCs in CDC patients, and are helpful in adjusting the treatment plan and avoiding the risk of pulmonary embolism.","Li, Whenzheng; Li, Fang; Wang, He; Long, Xueying; Ghimire, Obin; Pei, Yigang; Xiao, Xiangcheng; Ning, Jianping",Medicine,184,11

Our geometrical approach proceeds from an analysis of the crystal structure reported for each protein. We quantify, residue-by-residue and region-by-region, the spatial and angular changes in the structure as the protein denatures, and quantify differences that result from the seven residues that differ in the two proteins. Using two independent analyses, one based on spatial metrics and the second on angular metrics, we establish the order of unfolding of the five helices in cyt c-b562 and the four helices in the apo protein. For the two helices nearest the N-terminal end of both proteins, the ones in the apo protein unfold first. For the two helices nearest the C-terminal end, the interior helix of the apo protein unfolds first, whereas the terminal helix of the holo protein unfolds first. Excluded-volume effects (repulsive interactions) are minimized in turning regions; the overall range in Δ values is Δ = 36.3 Å3 for cyt c-b562 and Δ = 36.6 Å3 for the apo protein, whereas the span for all 20 amino acids is Δ = 167.7 Å3. As our work indicates that the interior helix of cytochrome c-b562 is the first to fold, we suggest that this helix protects the heme from misligation, consistent with ultrafast folding over a minimally frustrated funneled landscape.","Kozak, John J; Gray, Harry B; Garza-López, Roberto A",Journal of inorganic biochemistry,184,32

The Air Transportation System plays a critical role in such transmissions because it is responsible for fast and long-range human travel, while its building components-the airports-are crowded, confined areas with usually poor hygiene. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) consider hand hygiene as the most efficient and cost-effective way to limit disease propagation. Results from clinical studies reveal the effect of hand washing on individual transmissibility of infectious diseases. However, its potential as a mitigation strategy against the global risk for a pandemic has not been fully explored. Here, we use epidemiological modeling and data-driven simulations to elucidate the role of individual engagement with hand hygiene inside airports in conjunction with human travel on the global spread of epidemics. We find that, by increasing travelers engagement with hand hygiene at all airports, a potential pandemic can be inhibited by 24% to 69%. In addition, we identify 10 airports at the core of a cost-optimal deployment of the hand-washing mitigation strategy. Increasing hand-washing rate at only those 10 influential locations, the risk of a pandemic could potentially drop by up to 37%. Our results provide evidence for the effectiveness of hand hygiene in airports on the global spread of infections that could shape the way public-health policy is implemented with respect to the overall objective of mitigating potential population health crises.","Nicolaides, Christos; Avraam, Demetris; Cueto-Felgueroso, Luis; González, Marta C; Juanes, Ruben",Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,184,8

METHODS : The Interstitial Cystitis Association posted a Web link on its Web site offering its members participation in the Web-based questionnaire from April 2009 to February 2010. Members were asked questions on the effect of 344 different foods, drinks, supplements, condiments/spices, and general food categories on urinary frequency, urgency, and/or pelvic pain symptoms. Members were asked to score symptoms related to consumables on a symptom Likert scale of 0 to 5. Questions on ethnicity, education, symptom duration, seasonal allergies, irritable bowel syndrome, and specific diets were included. RESULTS : There were 598 complete responses to the questionnaire, and 95.8% of the participants answered that certain foods and beverages affected their IC/BPS symptoms. Most items had no effect on symptoms. Items that made symptoms worse were citrus fruits, tomatoes, coffee, tea, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, spicy foods, artificial sweeteners, and vitamin C. Only calcium glycerophosphate (Prelief; AK Pharma, Inc, Pleasantville, NJ) and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) had a trend toward improvement in symptoms. CONCLUSIONS : Interstitial cystitis diets do not have to be overly restrictive. It is recommended that patients with IC/BPS avoid citrus fruits, tomatoes, coffee, tea, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, spicy foods, artificial sweeteners, and vitamin C. The use of calcium glycerophosphate and/or sodium bicarbonate before consumption of these trigger consumables may also help reduce sensitivity.","Bassaly, Renee; Downes, Katheryne; Hart, Stuart",Female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery,184,19

This gap will increase with the current pandemic due to COVID-19. AIM To evaluate the current availability of digital health tools for the care of people with epilepsy according to the world medical literature and their use during said pandemic. DEVELOPMENT We reviewed the publications in scientific journals in the last decade that had as their main topic the use of digital health tools or telemedicine focused on the care of patients with epilepsy, including 4 months after the national quarantines due to the appearance of the virus SARS-CoV-2. Seventeen publications were found on the use of telemedicine focused on epilepsy. The most widely used tools internationally are online platforms, followed by mobile applications, videoconferences, epileptic seizure capture systems, checklists, algorithms for understanding medical data, phone calls, tele-encephalography and text messages. None was published during the COVID-19 current pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Although there is little literature on the use of digital health tools focused on epilepsy, there are several that can be used to fight the attention gap, especially in this global pandemic by COVID-19 that forces quarantines of people and communities for long periods. It is necessary to remove barriers and facilitate patient access to these new information technologies.","Santos-Peyret, A; Durón, R M; Sebastián-Díaz, M A; Crail-Meléndez, D; Goméz-Ventura, S; Briceño-González, E; Rito, Y; Martínez-Juárez, I E",Revista de neurologia,184,26

Stroke platform is a unified information platform that unites all stages of treatment of a patient with stroke, from the first symptoms to dispensary observation by a family doctor and control of targeted provision of medicines for the secondary prevention of vascular events. MATERIAL AND METHODS The SP includes 6 modules: the Central Archive of Medical Images or the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) and connection to a single circuit of all CT devices of the regional medical institutions; Stroke register; secondary prevention register; routing bureau; statistics and analytics; COVID platform. The SP, as it develops, can be supplemented with those modules that are necessary to improve the quality and availability of patient care. More than 100 consultations of CT images are carried out monthly through the SP, the average response time is less than 10 minutes, 52 platform participants are in constant contact, all medical institutions of the region are connected. Five hundred and forty patients were consulted for 6 months of 2020. RESULTS The share of hospitalizations in specialized departments increased to 97.6% versus 86.3%. The availability of high-tech medical care for patients with stroke has increased due to timely transfer to the district vascular center. Endovascular interventions for aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations, stenting of extracerebral arteries during dissection, mechanical thrombectomy from large arteries are performed. Mortality decreased from 19.7% (2019) to 17.6%. At the stage of outpatient follow-up, it is possible to obtain information about the range of those drugs that are prescribed to the patient for prophylaxis and are delivered to the target. CONCLUSION The main feature of the SP is the speed and efficiency of making medical decisions, ergonomics and ease of interaction, a single workspace.","Lykov, Yu A; Mikryukov, A V; Chefranova, Zh Yu; Yatsenko, E A; Vlasov, P N",Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

We aimed at validating vibrating signals of snoring as a single physiological parameter for screening and evaluating severity of OSA. METHODS Totally, 111 subjects from the sleep center of a tertiary referral center were categorized into four groups according to the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) obtained from PSG: simple snoring group (5 > AHI, healthy subjects, n = 11), mild OSA group (5 ≤ AHI < 15, n = 11), moderate OSA group (15 ≤ AHI < 30, n = 30) and severe OSA group (AHI ≥ 30, n = 59). Anthropometric parameters and sleep efficiency of all subjects were compared. Frequencies of amplitude changes of vibrating signals on anterior neck during sleep were analyzed to acquire a snoring burst index (SBI) using a novel algorithm. Data were compared with AHI and index of arterial oxygen saturation (Δ Index). RESULTS There were no significant differences in age and sleep efficiency among all groups. Bland-Altman analysis showed better agreement between SBI and AHI (r = 0.906, P < 0.001) than Δ Index and AHI (r = 0.859, P < 0.001). Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) showed substantially stronger sensitivity and specificity of SBI in distinguishing between patients with moderate and severe OSA compared with Δ Index (sensitivity: 81.4% vs 66.4%; specificity: 96.7% vs 86.7%, for SBI and Δ Index, respectively). CONCLUSION SBI may serve as a portable tool for screening patients and assessing OSA severity in a non-hospital setting.","Wu, Hsien-Tsai; Pan, Wen-Yao; Liu, An-Bang; Su, Mao-Chang; Chen, Hong-Ruei; Tsai, I-Ting; Lin, Meng-Chih; Sun, Cheuk-Kwan",The clinical respiratory journal,184,17

Methods: Newly diagnosed ILD patients (n = 60) were enrolled, whose serological levels of β-CGRP, α-CGRP, AQP5, receptor activity modifying protein 1, and receptor component protein were detected by ELISA. Th1 and Th2 cytokines and CD4+ and CD8+ cells were measured by flow cytometry method. In vivo, bleomycin (BLM) was set for modeling pulmonary fibrosis. A CALCA-HET model was set as a chronic pulmonary fibrosis model. Hematoxylin-eosin, immunohistochemistry, and Masson's trichrome staining were performed to assess the role of apoptosis in the injured lung. The concentrations of cytokines were determined by cytokine antibody arrays. Results: Abnormal activation of serological CD4+ T lymphocytes and predominant Th2 response was established in the patients with ILD. Moreover, the ratio of β-CGRP/α-CGRP positively correlated with the increased level of AQP5 in patients with ILD. In vivo, a significant increase of AQP5 and β-CGRP at the chronic stage of pulmonary fibrosis was induced by BLM in the mice model, whereas the expression of AQP5 protein was generally lower in the acute alveolitis phase. Moreover, the levels of AQP5 and α-CGRP in the CALCA-HET rats were lower than those of the normal saline group. The high ratio β-CGRP/α-CGRP enhanced the expression of AQP5, inhibited transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1)/P-Smad1/Smad4 pathway, and upregulated the NRF2 signal, whereas the apoptosis of AECs was significantly reduced in late-stage pulmonary fibrosis. Conclusions: The imbalance of β-CGRP/α-CGRP may be associated with the predominance of Th2 response and participate in the process of AEC apoptosis in lung fibrosis. The high ratio of β-CGRP/α-CGRP may elevate the level of AQP5 through inactivation of the TGF-β1/smad1 signaling pathway and upregulation of the Nrf2 signaling in the chronic stage of pulmonary fibrosis.","Lv, Xiaoting; Gao, Feng; Zhang, Shuyu; Zhang, Sheng; Zhou, Xiaohui; Ding, Fadian; Wang, Jingwen; Chen, Qingquan; Chen, Min; Liu, Qicai",Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,184,7

METHODS The study is an analysis of the results of the ADEA Survey of Dental School Seniors, 2020 Graduating Class. Each year, ADEA surveys senior predoctoral students from the accredited U.S. dental schools. Whenever feasible, the answers of the survey respondents from the 2020 class were compared with their 2015 counterparts. RESULTS The analysis revealed that 46% of the 2020 respondents decided to become a dentist before going to undergraduate college, more than the proportion of those deciding while in college (42%). When it comes to preparedness to practice dentistry, the responses indicated a high level of readiness to go into the profession. Seventy-seven percent of survey participants reported the COVID-19 pandemic did not affect their plans after graduation. Between 2015 and 2020, the share of survey respondents who planned to go into advanced dental education immediately after graduation increased from 35% to 40%. Almost a third of the 2020 respondents who planned to go into private practice immediately upon graduation intended to join a Dental Service Organization (DSO). Grants and scholarships represented a higher share of the average funding for dental education for the 2020 respondents than five years ago. The share of respondents expecting to graduate without any loans to finance their dental degrees and predental education (educational debt) increased significantly, from 12% in 2015 to 17% in 2020.

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infections have been demonstrated to impact the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and induce apoptosis in many cell lines. However, the detailed mechanism of EV71-induced apoptosis remains to be elucidated. In this study, we report that EV71 2B protein (2B) localized to the mitochondria and induced cell apoptosis by interacting directly with and activating the proapoptotic protein Bax. 2B recruited Bax to the mitochondria and induced Bax conformational activation. In addition, mitochondria isolated from 2B-expressing cells that were treated with a recombinant Bax showed increased Bax interaction and cytochrome c (Cyt c) release. Importantly, apoptosis in cells with either EV71 infection or 2B expression was dramatically reduced in Bax knockdown cells but not in Bak knockdown cells, suggesting that Bax played a pivotal role in EV71- or 2B-induced apoptosis. Further studies indicate that a hydrophobic region of 18 amino acids (aa) in the C-terminal region of 2B (aa 63 to 80) was responsible for the location of 2B in the mitochondria. A hydrophilic region of 14 aa in the N-terminal region of 2B was functional in Bax interaction and its subsequent activation. Moreover, overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL abrogates 2B-induced release of Cyt c and caspase activation. Therefore, this study provides direct evidence that EV71 2B induces cell apoptosis and impacts the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by directly modulating the redistribution and activation of proapoptotic protein Bax. IMPORTANCE EV71 infections are usually accompanied by severe neurological complications. It has also been postulated that the induction of cell apoptosis resulting from tissue damage is a possible process of EV71-related pathogenesis. In this study, we report that EV71 2B protein (2B) localized to the mitochondria and induced cell apoptosis by interacting directly with and activating the proapoptotic protein Bax. This study provides evidence that EV71 induces cell apoptosis by modulating Bax activation and reveals important clues regarding the mechanism of Cyt c release and mitochondrial permeabilization during EV71 infection.","Cong, Haolong; Du, Ning; Yang, Yang; Song, Lei; Zhang, Wenliang; Tien, Po",Journal of virology,184,16

METHODS The photograph rotation tool in the iPhone PHOTO app was used by 75 examiners to evaluate 22 photographs from only 9 patients, captured in infra- and supra-dextroversion, and infra- and supra-levoversion, as not all the patients were photographed in the 4 positions mentioned. Each patient received a score for the superior and inferior oblique muscle functions, ranging from -4 (hypofunction) to 4 (hyperfunction) or 0 (normal function), using preediting and postediting photographs. These values were compared with the scores previously given by trained personnel in strabismus screening. The difference in score between the two groups was expressed in natural (whole and non-negative) numbers. The mean and pattern deviation were then calculated. RESULTS The scores of most of the edited photos showed a lower mean than those of the unedited ones, except for a patient with left superior oblique hyperfunction. The patients with no oblique dysfunction and those with right superior oblique hyperfunction demonstrated (after editing the photograph) scores with greater similarity with their initial scores (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). Similar results were found in the patients with oblique hypofunctions and right inferior oblique hyperfunction (p<0.01). CONCLUSION The proposed method for assessing muscular function in vertical strabismus is reproducible, accessible, simple, and reliable, and provides better consistency to the admeasurement.","Rautha, Yessa Vervloet Bertollo Lamego; Carvalho, Luis Eduardo Morato Rebouças de; Vadas, Marcelo Francisco Gaal; Uesugui, Carlos Fumiaki; Sakano, Laís Yumi; Barcellos, Ronaldo Boaventura",Arquivos brasileiros de oftalmologia,184,1

RECENT FINDINGS The prevalence of bacterial and viral infections continue to increase, because of the acquisition of rhinovirus, coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, OC43), influenza A H1N1, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus during Hajj. Whilst MERS-CoV continues to circulate in the Middle East, no cases of MERS-CoV have yet been identified in pilgrims during Hajj. SUMMARY Respiratory tract infections are a major cause of morbidity in pilgrims attending mass gathering events. The management of severe respiratory infections should consider investigation and empirical coverage for the most likely agents based on syndromic surveillance data from hosting country and /or other relevant exposure history during events.

OBJECTIVE We aimed to determine if low-dose dexmedetomidine would reduce remifentanil requirements during Nociception Level Index-guided antinociception without increasing complications associated with dexmedetomidine. DESIGN Double-blind randomised controlled trial. SETTING Two university teaching hospitals in Brussels, Belgium. PATIENTS American Society of Anesthesiologists 1 and 2 patients (n = 58) undergoing maxillofacial or cervicofacial surgery under propofol--remifentanil target-controlled infusion anaesthesia. INTERVENTIONS A 30 min infusion of dexmedetomidine, or equal volume of 0.9% NaCl, was infused at 1.2 μg kg h immediately preceding induction and then decreased to 0.6 μg kg h until 30 min before ending surgery. Nociception Level Index and frontal electroencephalogram guided the remifentanil and propofol infusions, respectively. MAIN OUTCOMES The primary outcome was the remifentanil requirement. Other outcomes included the propofol requirement, cardiovascular status and postoperative outcome. RESULTS Mean ± SD remifentanil (3.96 ± 1.95 vs. 4.42 ± 2.04 ng ml; P = 0.0024) and propofol (2.78 ± 1.36 vs. 3.06 ± 1.29 μg ml; P = 0.0046) TCI effect site concentrations were lower in the dexmedetomidine group at 30 min postincision and remained lower throughout surgery. When remifentanil (0.133 ± 0.085 vs. 0.198 ± 0.086 μg kg min; P = 0.0074) and propofol (5.7 ± 2.72 vs. 7.4 ± 2.80 mg kg h; P = 0.0228) requirements are represented as infusion rates, this effect became statistically significant at 2 h postincision. CONCLUSION In ASA 1 and 2 patients receiving Nociception Level Index-guided antinociception, dexmedetomidine decreases intra-operative remifentanil requirements. Combined frontal electroencephalogram and Nociception Level Index monitoring can measure dexmedetomidine's hypnotic and opioid-sparing effects during remifentanil-propofol target-controlled infusion anaesthesia.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels achieved after statin reinitiation are unknown. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to determine LDL-C levels after statin reinitiation. METHODS We analyzed data from 5498 participants in the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke study who reported ever taking a statin. We categorized participants according to their pattern of statin use including those taking a statin who did not experience statin-associated symptoms and continued treatment, and those who discontinued statins because of statin-associated symptoms and were not reinitiated, reinitiated and remained on treatment, and discontinued treatment after being reinitiated. Mortality and vascular event reduction with statin reinitiation was estimated using data from the Cholesterol-Lowering Treatment Trialists Collaboration. RESULTS After multivariable adjustment, LDL-C was 14.1 (95% CI: 9.9-18.3) mg/dL higher among participants reinitiated and taking a statin compared with those without statin-associated symptoms who continued statin therapy. Mean LDL-C was 18.1 mg/dL (95% CI: 13.0-23.1) and 27.5 mg/dL (95% CI: 20.7-34.4) lower among participants reinitiated and taking a statin compared with those who discontinued statin therapy and were not reinitiated and those who discontinued statins after being reinitiated, respectively. An LDL-C reduction of 18.1 mg/dL with statin reinitiation was projected to reduce all-cause and coronary heart disease mortality by 5.6% and 8.9%, respectively, and myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease death and major vascular events by 10.7% and 9.8%, respectively, over 5 years.

Understanding the taxonomic profile of microorganisms in the impacted systems is required to establish taxa that are bio-indicators of toxicants, and provide possible taxa for mitigating ecotoxicity of the HWWs. Geochemistry, pollution status and ecotoxicity of heavy metals (HMs) in HWW-impacted sewer (LU) were assessed. The microbiome profiling was based on 16S rDNA and ITS of 18S rDNA metagenomes. The degree of HMs contamination exceeded 50 and HMs pollution load index of LU was severe (1,084), which consequently exerted severe risk (1,411,575 toxic response factors) with very high toxic responses of Co, Cu, Pb, and Cd. Eco-toxicological impact of the HMs on LU skewed microbiome towards Proteobacteria (43%), Actinobacteria (18%), and about 5% apiece for Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Plantomycetes, and Bacteroidetes. Likewise, the relative abundance of in LU inclined towards Ascomycota (59%), Basidiomycota (17%) and unclassified Eukarya_uc_p (16%). Exclusively found in LU sediments were 44,862 bacterial species and 42,881 fungi taxa, while 72,877 and 53,971 species of bacteria and fungi, respectively, were found missing.

However, for difficult cases, there are limited insertion techniques available in routine clinical practice, considering the flexibility of NGTs. The SUZY curved forceps are designed for the removal of pharyngolaryngeal foreign bodies under guidance of the McGRATH MAC (McG) videolaryngoscope. Because McG enables clear visualization of the esophageal inlet, we hypothesized that the SUZY forceps can facilitate easier NGT insertion compared with the conventional Magill forceps under McG guidance and designed a randomized, crossover manikin study to test this hypothesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten anesthesiologists participated in this study. Each participant was instructed to insert an NGT using either the SUZY or the Magill forceps under McG guidance. Both types of forceps were used by each participant in a computer-generated random order. The primary outcome measure was the number of ""strokes"" (1 stroke was defined by a specific sequence of participant actions) required to advance the NGT 30 cm from the starting point. Data are expressed as medians (interquartile ranges [ranges]). RESULTS The number of strokes required for NGT insertion was fewer in the SUZY group than in the Magill group {7 [7.0-12.5 (5-14)] vs 16.5 [13.5-20.3 (7-22)]; P <.05}. The time required for NGT insertion was also lesser in the SUZY group than in the Magill group {15.4 [13.7-20.0 (7.0-38.3)] seconds vs 30.3 [22.0-42.3 (12.8-47.5) seconds]; P <.05}. CONCLUSIONS The SUZY curved forceps facilitated NGT insertion more effectively than the Magill straight forceps under McG guidance.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a fundamental role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis because it allows viral entry into host cells. Here we show that ACE2 nanodecoys derived from human lung spheroid cells (LSCs) can bind and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and protect the host lung cells from infection. In mice, these LSC-nanodecoys were delivered via inhalation therapy and resided in the lungs for over 72 h post-delivery. Furthermore, inhalation of the LSC-nanodecoys accelerated clearance of SARS-CoV-2 mimics from the lungs, with no observed toxicity. In cynomolgus macaques challenged with live SARS-CoV-2, four doses of these nanodecoys delivered by inhalation promoted viral clearance and reduced lung injury.

The largest, resected metastasis in each patient was assessed with CT texture analysis and semiquantitative 18F-FDG PET parameters. Correlation between imaging parameters and histopathological mutations (BRAF- and NRAS- genes) were calculated. RESULTS Attenuation standard deviation (SD) within target lesion indicated a weak correlation with its SUVpeak (rho -0.292, p 0.017). However, no correlation between CT texture analysis, metabolic 18F-FDG PET parameters and tumour cell mutation could be established. CONCLUSION CT texture parameters cannot replace the diagnostic value of 18F- FDG PET/CT for metabolic information in melanoma patients. Discrimination between BRAF- and NRAS mutation status was not feasible with CT texture analysis in this exploratory study.","Olthof, Susann-Cathrin; Krumm, Patrick; Weichold, Oliver; Eigentler, Thomas; Bösmüller, Hans; la Fougère, Christian; Pfannenberg, Christina; Martus, Peter; Klumpp, Bernhard",European journal of radiology,184,12

METHODS This review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in July 2019. Studies were identified by conducting searches for Medline (using the PubMed interface), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Ovid Gateway (Embase and Ovid) using a list of defined search terms. RESULTS 15 out of 37 studies included men only, 10 studies women only and 11 both sexes. Most participants were aged 50 to 65 years. Most studies (n = 34) focused on muscle invasive BC and only three on non-muscle invasive BC. Measurements of sexual dysfunction, including erection, ejaculation, firmness and desire, were the most commonly used measurements to report sexual health in men. In women, lubrification/dryness, desire, orgasm and dyspareunia were the most commonly reported. Twenty-one studies evaluated sexual dysfunction based on validated questionnaires, two with a non-validated questionnaire and through interviewing participants. CONCLUSION While recognition of the importance of the inclusion of psychometric measurements to assess sexual health is growing, there is a lack of consistent measures to assess sexual health in BC. With the focus on QoL arising in cancer survivorship, further studies are needed to develop, standardize and implement use of sexual health questionnaires with appropriate psychometrics and social measures to evaluate QoL in BC patients.

Electrohydrodynamic inkjet (EHD) printing is a potential method to effectively fabricate micro scale PDMS devices because EHD printing is environment-friendly, low-cost, compatible to various inks, and most importantly, high resolution. However, little research has been conducted to study EHD printing of PDMS-based ink. In this paper, EHD printing of PDMS has been investigated. The effects of several critical parameters on the printing process were studied. The dimension of the printed patterns and the printing frequency were preciously controlled by the voltage parameters. The patterns with a network structure was demonstrated. The results indicated that the voltage amplitude and the pulse frequency could both control the dimensions of droplets and the printing frequency. As future work, we plan to develop a simulation tool to predict printing quality of PDMS and optimize printing process to fabricated 3D PDMS structures in micro scale.","Jiang, Liangkui; Huang, Yanhua; Zhang, Xiao; Qin, Hantang",Procedia Manufacturing,184,16

In particular, digitalization in the care structure should be further intensified in order to withstand the pressure from societal demographic change, globalization of the economy and medical-technical progress. However, digital services in telemedicine require acceptance from both patients and doctors as a primary prerequisite for successful take-off. In the present study, patients who had previously been treated for back pain were asked about the acceptance of the use of a video consultation. With previous experience in the professional or private sector, the acceptance, regardless of the age of the patients, was higher than without previous points of contact with digital services. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic prevailing during the survey, patients nevertheless showed a higher willingness to use video consultation. This is in spite of the actual previous number of participants in online consultations being extremely low. This could be traced back to the lack of offers by doctors, which could be due to insufficient opportunities caused by a restrictive legal context. However, the positive development of recent years with the enactment of the eHealth Act (2015) and the Digital Care Act (2020) can now help to further develop the digitization process in the German healthcare system.","Hoch, P.; Arets, J.",Bewegungstherapie Und Gesundheitssport,184,1

Given waning antibody titers over time, future residual population immunity against influenza will be reduced. The implication for the subsequent 2021-22 influenza season is unknown. Methods We used an agent-based model of influenza implemented in the FRED (Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamics) simulation platform to estimate cases and hospitalization over two succeeding influenza seasons. The model uses a synthetic population to represent an actual population, and individual interactions in workplaces, school, households and neighborhoods. The impact of reduced residual immunity was estimated as a consequence of increased protective measures (e.g., social distancing and school closure) in the first season. The impact was contrasted by the level of similarity (cross-immunity) between influenza strains over the seasons. Results When the second season strains were dissimilar to the first season (have a low level of cross immunity), a low first season has limited impact on second season cases. When a high level of cross-immunity exists between strains in the 2 seasons, the first season has a much greater impact on the second season. In both cases this is modified by the transmissibility of strains in the 2 seasons. In the context of the 2021-22 season, the worst case scenario is a highly transmissible strain causing increased cases and hospitalizations over average influenza seasons, with a possible significant increase in cases in some scenarios. The most likely overall scenario for 2021-22 is a more modest increase in flu cases over an average season. Discussion Given the light 2020-21 season, we found that a large, compensatory second season might occur in 2021-22, depending on cross-immunity from past infection and transmissibility of strains. Furthermore, we found that enhanced vaccine coverage could reduce this high, compensatory season. Young children may be especially at risk in 2021-22 since very young children were unlikely to have had any exposure to infection and most immunity in that age group would be from vaccination, which wanes quickly.","Krauland, M.

The direction of travel for much 'education first' educational tourism is from less- to more-economically developed countries, yet the existing literature tends to focus on the health-related expectations, precautions and behaviours of students travelling in the other direction. We explore the health implications of the international sojourn for students in UK higher education from various developing countries, and attendant risks such as the translocation of disease (a concern elevated by the COVID-19 pandemic). Drawing on, fusing and extending ideas from research on education and health mobilities, we examine students' experiences beyond the much-discussed first few weeks after arrival which is typically understood in terms of culture shock. Using narrative research and interviews with a purposive sample of students from ten countries/territories to establish their travel health preparations and perceptions, we reveal that they made extensive use of non-medical sources of advice including family and friends, the internet and study abroad agents. When they did become ill it was an isolating, distressing and frustrating experience due to delays in obtaining a doctor's appointment and the lack of social support away from home. Of some concern, these students perceived a low risk to traveling to and studying in the UK, and had given little thought to the possibility of inadvertently transmitting disease across borders. These findings will inform our understanding of international students' health, and have the potential to shape related policy and practice in origin and destination countries alike.","Gale, T.; Obasaju, T.; Brown, L.",Tourism Geographies,184,17

Background: Coughing is known to produce a significant amount of aerosols and is thus commonly used as a best reference for high-risk aerosol-generation. Accordingly, procedures during which aerosol generation exceeds the amount of aerosol generated in instances of coughing are seen as high risk aerosol generating procedures. However, no reliable quantitative values are available for high risk aerosol-generation. Methods: Coughing was measured from 37 healthy volunteers in the operating room environment. Aerosol particles generated during coughing within the size range of 0.3 - 10 microm were measured with Optical Particle Sizer from 40cm, 70cm, and 100cm distances. The distances reflected potential exposure distances where personnel are during surgeries. Results: A total of 306 coughs were measured. Average aerosol concentration during coughing was 1.580 +/- 13.774 particles/cm3 (range 0.000 - 195.528). Discussion: The aerosol concentration measured in this study can be used as a limit for high-risk aerosol generation in the operating room environment when assessing the aerosol generating procedures and the risk of operating room staff s exposure for aerosol particles.

Yet, the intersection of these two sets of scholarship is largely underexplored. Recognizing this gap, a valuable case study can be found in Brazil, which is home to both the only LGBTQI+ refugee centre in Latin America, Casa Miga, and a growing anti-gay and anti-gender counter-movement. Thus, to better understand the conceptual novelty of the intersection of queer migration and counter-movement literature, we draw on 26 interviews with Venezuelan LGBTQI+ asylum seekers, politicians, NGOs, and UN staff in Brazil conducted before and during the pandemic. Our central argument is that Casa Miga, an LGBTQI+ refugee centre, is an essential bulwark against the coordinated counter-movements that share the goal of defeating LGBTQI+ and feminist agendas in Brazil. We conclude that lacking local avenues for action, international appeals during COVID-19 for gender and LGBTQI+ sensitive responses become critical. Indeed, the gendered impacts of COVID-19 – regarding women – are becoming well-known due to vocal feminist groups worldwide. Yet, these calls for action have largely missed analysing how COVID-19 impacts LGBTQI+ populations, even in gender-sensitive reporting.

Additionally, in this process we gained feedback from experts for our own development.We evaluated the program through weekly feedback forms, in-session polls, and live whiteboard interaction, enabling week-by-week improvements. Students reported their need for clinical teaching and social interaction was addressed when many felt isolated. From 79 respondents, 64% felt that sessions were stronger being peer rather than clinician led (29% were neutral). 93% felt that peer-driven gamification made sessions more fun.This project demonstrates that students can generate high-level, interactive, peer-to-peer education with low time investment by clinical staff, and boost student morale even at a challenging time. Our strengthening of relationships between graduate educators and medical faculty will enable us to shape future learning at UCLMS.Peer-led, MedEd, gamification, distance","Casalotti, Seb Rai Salina Norris Isabel Singh Amandeep Choa George Johnston Rebecca Sen Camilla Baki Yasmin",BMJ Leader,184,29

Derivatives of the metabolites itaconate and fumarate, dimethyl itaconate (DMI), 4-octyl itaconate (4OI) and dimethyl fumarate (DMF), limit both expression of IL-1β, and IL-1β release following NLRP3 inflammasome activation. However, the direct effects of these metabolite derivatives on NLRP3 inflammasome responses in macrophages and microglia require further investigation. Using murine bone marrow-derived macrophages, mixed glia and organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs), we demonstrate that DMI and 4OI pre-treatment limited IL-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor production in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) priming, as well as inhibiting subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome activation. DMI, 4OI, DMF and monomethyl fumarate (MMF), another fumarate derivative, also directly inhibited biochemical markers of NLRP3 activation in LPS-primed macrophages, mixed glia and OHSCs, including ASC speck formation, caspase-1 activation, gasdermin D cleavage and IL-1β release. Finally, DMF, an approved treatment for multiple sclerosis, as well as DMI, 4OI and MMF, inhibited NLRP3 activation in macrophages in response to the phospholipid lysophosphatidylcholine, which is used to induce demyelination, suggesting a possible mechanism of action for DMF in multiple sclerosis through NLRP3 inhibition. Together, these findings reveal the importance of immunometabolic regulation for both the priming and activation steps of NLRP3 activation in macrophages and microglia. Furthermore, we highlight itaconate and fumarate derivatives as a potential therapeutic option in NLRP3-driven diseases, including in the brain. Summary statement We show that itaconate and fumarate derivatives inhibit both the priming and activation steps of NLRP3 inflammasome responses in macrophages and microglia, revealing the importance of immunometabolic NLRP3 regulation.","Hoyle, Christopher; Green, Jack P; Allan, Stuart M; Brough, David; Lemarchand, Eloise",bioRxiv,184,1

The hybridomas produced mainly IgG2a or IgG1 antibodies. Western immunoblotting experiments with purified virus, and immunoprecipitation tests with [35S]methionine-labelled infected cell extracts, allowed assessment of the polypeptide specificity of the MAbs. Sixteen hybridomas secreted antibodies directed to the peplomeric protein (E2, gp200/gp100) and putative intracellular precursors of apparent Mr 170K to 180K and 90K. Four hybridomas produced antibodies that selectively reacted with a glycoprotein with an Mr of 140K (E3). This polypeptide species corresponded to the major structural component of small granular projections, located near the base of the larger bulbous peplomers, and was found to be responsible for haemagglutination. The major neutralization-mediating determinants were found to be carried by both E2 and E3 glycoproteins. Eight hybridomas produced MAbs directed to the major nucleocapsid protein (N, 52K), and only one MAb reacted with a low Mr structural glycoprotein (24K), corresponding to the matrix (E1) protein. By indirect immunofluorescence, MAbs of different specificity also revealed distinct patterns of distribution of the viral antigens within the cells. The location on the virion of the antigenic determinants recognized by MAbs of different specificity was determined by the use of an immunogold electron microscopy technique. Comparison of nine TCV Quebec strains, using MAbs directed to peplomer and haemagglutinin proteins of the prototype Minnesota strain, confirmed their close antigenic relationship, but also revealed the occurrence of at least two distinct antigenic groups.","Dea, S; Tijssen, P",The Journal of general virology,184,1

In this study, we have investigated the intracellular localization and distribution of UL51 protein both in infected cells and in transfected cells expressing only UL51. We found that this protein colocalized closely with Golgi marker proteins such as the Golgi-58K protein and GM130 in transfected cells expressing only UL51. However, in infected cells, the UL51 protein localized to the juxtanuclear region but only partially colocalized with the Golgi maker proteins. Mutant protein analysis revealed that the N-terminal 15 amino acid residues of the UL51 protein sufficed for this Golgi localization property. The UL51 protein redistributed on addition of brefeldin A. This was prevented by pretreatment with 2-deoxyglucose and sodium azide, which results in ATP depletion, but not by pretreatment with NaF and AlCl(3), which activates heterotrimeric G proteins. Moreover, we found that palmitoylation of the UL51 protein through the N-terminal cysteine at position 9 was necessary for its Golgi localization. Protease digestion analysis suggested that the UL51 protein localized on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane in UL51-transfected cells, while in infected cells it localized mainly to the inside of cytoplasmic vesicles and/or the viral envelope. Transmission immunoelectron microscopy revealed an association of UL51 protein-specific labeling with cytoplasmic virions and also with some membranous structure. We infer from these observations that internalization of UL51 protein into the cytoplasmic vesicle and/or virion may occur in association with viral envelopment in HSV-infected cells.","Nozawa, Naoki; Daikoku, Tohru; Koshizuka, Tetsuo; Yamauchi, Yohei; Yoshikawa, Tetsushi; Nishiyama, Yukihiro",Journal of virology,184,23

PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: 84 patients with MRI of the lungs: group 1 (n = 56) - with signs of effective TB treatment at the end of the intensive phase; group 2 (n = 28) - patients with signs of ineffective treatment. We used the multivariate discriminant analysis method using the statistical environment STATISTICA 13. RESULTS Results: During the discriminant analysis, the parameters of the clinical blood analysis (monocytes, stab leukocytes, erythrocytes) were selected, which were associated with high (r> 0.5) statistically significant correlations with the levels of MMP-9, TIMP-1, oxyproline and its fractions and aldosterone in the formation of the prognosis. The mathematical model allows, in the form of comparing the results of solving two linear equations and comparing their results, to predict the outcome of treatment: ""1"" effective treatment, ""2"" - ineffective treatment. Early prediction of treatment effectiveness is promising, as it allows the use of the developed mathematical model as an additional criterion for the selection of patients for whom surgical treatment is recommended, in order to increase the effectiveness of treatment. CONCLUSION Conclusions: An additional criterion for predicting ineffective MRI treatment, along with the criteria provided for by WHO recommendations, is a mathematical model that takes into account probably strong correlation (r = 0.5, p <0.05) between the factors of connective tissue destruction, collagen destruction, aldosterone , and indicators of a clinical blood test (between levels of OBZ and monocytes (r = 0.82, p = 0.00001), OB and monocytes (r = 0.92, p = 0.000001) OB and stab leukocytes (r = - 0.87, p = 0.0003) OBZ and stab leukocytes (r = - 0.53, p = 0.017), aldosterone and ESR.","Shevchenko, Olha S; Todoriko, Liliia D; Ovcharenko, Iryna A; Pogorelova, Olga O; Semianiv, Ihor O",Wiadomosci lekarskie,184,15

Israeli residents perform shifts extending up to 26 hours, a practice leading to general dissatisfaction. In early 2020, during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many Israeli hospitals transitioned from 26-hour shifts to 13-hour shifts in fixed teams (capsules) followed by a 24-hour rest period at home. The regulation changes enacted by the Israeli government during the COVID-19 pandemic provided a rare opportunity to assess perception by residents regarding length of shifts before and after the change. OBJECTIVES To assess perception of pediatric residency in three aspects: resident wellness, ability to deliver quality healthcare, and acquisition of medical education following the change to the shorter shifts model. METHODS We performed a prospective observational study among pediatric residents. Residents completed an online self-assessment questionnaire before and after the COVID-19 emergency regulations changed toward shorter shifts. RESULTS Sixty-seven residents answered the questionnaires before (37) and after (30) the shift changes. The average score was significantly better for the 13-hour shifts versus the 26-hour shifts, except for questions regarding available time for research. There was a positive perception regarding the shorter night shifts model among pediatric residents, with an increase in general satisfaction and improvement in perception of general wellness, ability to deliver quality healthcare, and medical education acquisition. CONCLUSIONS Following the change to shorter shift length, perception of pediatric residents included improvement in wellness, ability to deliver quality healthcare, and availability of medical education.","Damari, Eytan; Fargel, Alon; Berger, Itai; Ron, Reut; Yeshayahu, Yonatan",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,184,16

Quarantine, that may be defined as a restraint on the activities of people or on the traffic of goods, targeted to the prevention of the diffusion of communicable pathologies, is a health concept profoundly rooted in the history of mankind. The lessons of the past are always pertinent for the present and for the future, in particular from a public health standpoint. One of the most relevant of them is connected with previous influenza pandemics, similar to the current COVID-19 2019/2020 pandemic, and it indicates that it is practically impossible, even in recent times, to contain the infection in the geographic area where it has risen and to prevent its trans-national disseminated spread.

Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) with COVID-19 have different clinical characteristics and prognostic outcomes. This study aimed to summarize the clinical characteristics and laboratory indicators of patients with COVID-19 with CVD, especially the critically ill patients. Methods and Results This study included 244 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and CVD (hypertension, coronary heart disease, or heart failure). The patients were categorized into critical (n=36) and noncritical (n=208) groups according to the interim guidance of China's National Health Commission. Clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were collected from the patients' medical records and compared between the 2 groups. The average body mass index of patients was significantly higher in the critical group than in the noncritical group. Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and fibrinogen, and d-dimer levels at admission were significantly increased in the critical group. The all-cause mortality rate among cases of COVID-19 combined with CVD was 19.26%; the proportion of coronary heart disease and heart failure was significantly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. High body mass index, previous history of coronary heart disease, lactic acid accumulation, and a decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen were associated with death. Conclusions All-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19 with CVD in hospitals is high. The high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio may be a predictor of critical patients. Overweight/obesity combined with coronary heart disease, severe hypoxia, and lactic acid accumulation resulting from respiratory failure are related to poor outcomes.

This study examined the effect of three NSA congeners on freshwater organisms: barium dinonylnaphthalene sulfonate (BaDNS), calcium dinonylnaphthalene sulfonate (CaDNS), and dinonylnaphthalene disulfonic acid (DNDS). Chronic effects were characterized by exposing fertilized fathead minnow eggs to sediment-associated NSAs and measuring various developmental and growth endpoints for 21 d. No effects in hatch success and larval growth were observed when fathead minnow eggs were exposed to CaDNS and DNDS concentrations up to 246 and 798 µg/g dry weight, respectively, in spiked sediment (~2% organic carbon). However, when NSAs were associated with substrate containing no organic carbon (sand), EC50s for fathead minnow hatch success, larval growth, biomass production, and overall survival were 58.3, 18.8, 15.5, and 13.8 µg/L, respectively, for CaDNS. Acute effect characterization was also conducted in water-only exposures for the three NSA congeners using the freshwater amphipod Hyalella azteca, the pulmonate snail Planorbella pilsbryi, and larval freshwater mussels Lampsilis cardium and Lampsilis siliquoidea. The sulfonate salts (BaDNS and CaDNS) were significantly more acutely toxic to all tested invertebrates in the water-only exposures, with LC50s ranging from 0.47 to 12.1 µg/L, compared to DNDS (LC50s &#8805; 98.2 µg/L). This is the first study to provide empirical data on the aquatic toxicity of three NSA congeners.","Matten, K J; Parrott, J L; Bartlett, A J; Gillis, P L; Milani, D; Toito, J; Balakrishnan, V K; Prosser, R S",Sci Total Environ,184,21

Here we introduce an alternative approach for glymphatic system quantification in the mouse brain via T1 mapping which also captures drainage of Gd-DOTA to the cervical lymph nodes. The Gd-DOTA injection into CSF was performed on the bench after which the mice underwent T1 mapping using a 3D spoiled gradient echo sequence on a 9.4 T MRI. In Ketamine/Xylazine (KX) anesthetized mice, glymphatic transport and drainage of Gd-DOTA to submandibular and deep cervical lymph nodes was demonstrated as 25-50% T1 reductions in comparison to control mice receiving CSF saline. To further validate the T1 mapping approach we also verified increased glymphatic transport of Gd-DOTA transport in mice anesthetized with KX in comparison with ISO. The novel T1 mapping method allows for quantification of glymphatic transport as well as drainage to the deep and superficial cervical lymph nodes. The ability to measure glymphatic transport and cervical lymph node drainage in the same animal longitudinally is advantageous and time efficient and the coupling between the two systems can be studied and translated to human studies.","Xue, Yuechuan; Liu, Xiaodan; Koundal, Sunil; Constantinou, Stefan; Dai, Feng; Santambrogio, Laura; Lee, Hedok; Benveniste, Helene",Sci Rep,184,21

METHODS: Parents of children ages 4-12 in San Francisco with BMI&#8805;85th percentile measured at a clinic visit at an FQHC or academic practice from January 1st to March 15th, 2020 were eligible to participate. Parents completed a survey reporting on child health behaviors and household food insecurity prior to and since the start of the pandemic. Survey items were abstracted from validated surveys with adaptations. Regression models evaluated associations between food insecurity and dietary intake variables. RESULTS: Most participants (n=145) were publicly insured (90%), Latino (77%), and spoke Spanish at home (70%). Parents perceived that child mean daily non-academic screen time was higher during the pandemic compared to before (3.8 hours vs 1.6 hours). Mean daily physical activity was reported to be lower compared to prior to the pandemic (1 hour vs 1.8 hours). On average, reported bedtime shifted 1.6 hours later. Food insecurity increased significantly, but was not associated with intake of fruits, vegetables, sugar-sweetened beverages, or foods with added sugar during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Parents of children with overweight or obesity in San Francisco perceive increased child screen time, decreased physical activity and later bedtimes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings suggest a need for policies that support healthy lifestyle behaviors among low-income children during the pandemic.","Beck, Amy L; Huang, John C; Lendzion, Lauren; Fernandez, Alicia; Martinez, Suzanna",,184,24

The purpose of this review is to provide an update on azole resistance mechanisms and their epidemiology in A. fumigatus, the clinical implications of azole resistance, and to discuss future treatment options against azole-resistant aspergillosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Resistance may develop through either patient or environmental azole exposure. Environmental exposure is the most prevalent means of resistance development, and these isolates can cause disease in various at-risk groups, which now include those with influenza, and potentially COVID-19. Although current treatment options are limited, newer therapies are in clinical development. These include agents with novel mechanisms of action which have in vitro and in vivo activity against azole-resistant A. fumigatus. SUMMARY: Azole-resistant A. fumigatus is an emerging threat that hampers our ability to successfully treat patients with aspergillosis. Certain geographic regions and patient populations appear to be at increased risk for this pathogen. As new patient groups are increasingly recognized to be at increased risk for invasive aspergillosis, studies to define the epidemiology and management of azole-resistant A. fumigatus are critically needed. While treatment options are currently limited, new agents under clinical development may offer hope.","Wiederhold, Nathan P; Verweij, Paul E",Curr Opin Infect Dis,184,24

Hypertension has been widely reported to be associated with increased disease severity; however, some studies reported different findings. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to evaluate the association between hypertension and severe and fatal COVID­19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Scopus, Medline, and Web of Science databases were searched to identify studies reporting the rate of hypertensive patients in the population diagnosed with severe or nonsevere COVID­19 or in COVID-19 survivors and nonsurvivors. The obtained data were pooled into a meta­analysis to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. RESULTS: Hypertension was associated with a nearly 2.5­fold increased risk of severe COVID­19 (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.98-3.12; I2 = 24%), as well as with a similarly significant higher mortality risk (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.51-3.90; I2 = 0%). In a meta­regression analysis, a correlation was observed between an increase in the mean age of patients with severe COVID­19 and an increased log OR of hypertension and COVID-19 severity (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: This pooled analysis of the current literature would suggest that hypertension may be associated with an up to 2.5­fold higher risk of severe or fatal COVID­19, especially in older individuals.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Wong, Johnny; Henry, Brandon M",Pol Arch Intern Med,184,1

National and international triage guidelines emerged from professional and governmental bodies and have led to controversial discussions about which criteria-e.g. medical prognosis, age, life-expectancy or quality of life-are ethically acceptable. The paper presents the main points of agreement and disagreement in triage protocols and reviews the ethical debate surrounding them. SOURCES OF DATA: Published articles, news articles, book chapters, ICU triage guidelines set out by professional societies and health authorities. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Points of agreement in the guidelines that are widely supported by ethical arguments are (i) to avoid using a first come, first served policy or quality-adjusted life-years and (ii) to rely on medical prognosis, maximizing lives saved, justice as fairness and non-discrimination. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Points of disagreement in existing guidelines and the ethics literature more broadly regard the use of exclusion criteria, the role of life expectancy, the prioritization of healthcare workers and the reassessment of triage decisions. GROWING POINTS: Improve outcome predictions, possibly aided by Artificial intelligence (AI); develop participatory approaches to drafting, assessing and revising triaging protocols; learn from experiences with implementation of guidelines with a view to continuously improve decision-making. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Examine the universality vs. context-dependence of triaging principles and criteria; empirically test the appropriateness of triaging guidelines, including impact on vulnerable groups and risk of discrimination; study the potential and challenges of AI for outcome and preference prediction and decision-support.","Vinay, Rasita; Baumann, Holger; Biller-Andorno, Nikola",Br. med. bull,184,24

Studies on online individual therapy indicate that therapists often have favorable attitudes toward this modality. To date, there is scant work on couples therapists' attitudes, despite the fact that the provision of online couples' therapy poses unique challenges (e.g., dealing with escalating conflict remotely). To provide a snapshot, in real time, as to how therapists experience the transition to online therapy, we surveyed 166 Israeli couples' therapists during April 2020, when lockdown orders prevented therapists from seeing couples face-to-face. A few weeks later, when the stay-at-home policy was lifted, a subsample (N = 60) of these therapists completed a follow-up assessment. The results suggest that couples therapists had limited experience using the online modality prior to COVID. The therapists reported experiencing online couples' therapy as somewhat successful and that their experience of providing therapy during the COVID-19 crisis had an overall positive impact on their attitudes toward online work. Establishing a strong therapeutic bond with both partners, dealing with escalating conflict, and treatment dropout were identified as the issues of most concern when conducting online couples therapy. The perceived difficulties with online therapy prospectively predicted lower usage of online couples' therapy, as well as less intention to continue online treatment once the crisis is over.","Machluf, Reut; Abba Daleski, Michal; Shahar, Ben; Kula, Ofra; Bar-Kalifa, Eran",Fam. process,184,22

This virus causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has led to numerous deaths worldwide. A large percentage of infected patients present asymptomatically, augmenting the spread of the virus. Symptomatic COVID19 commonly causes mild to severe respiratory disease and fever, but some individuals experience serious complications that can result in death. Immune compromised, high risk, and elderly individuals are at an increased risk of more severe consequences of the illness such as respiratory failure, organ dysfunction, and shock. Cytokine storm (also known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS)), a systemic inflammatory response that can be triggered by an infection, has been associated with the symptom progression of COVID-19. This review evaluates several published studies that have implemented Tocilizumab (TCZ), an IL-6 receptor antibody (US20120253016A1), in COVID-19 treatment. Outcomes and biomarkers of patients treated with TCZ are compared to patients treated with standard of care regimens. Interleukin6 (IL-6), a prominent inflammatory cytokine involved in CRS in various inflammatory conditions, may have a vital role in the underlying mechanism involved in debilitating SARS-CoV-2 infections and could serve as a viable treatment target.

A total of 119 nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from symptomatic patients. A subset of samples, positive with two RT-qPCR assays were then tested with isothermal PCR and rapid antigen tests. Of the 119 specimens, 65 were positive by at least two PCR assays. All PCR assays showed substantial or perfect match, although some variations in the clinical performance was observed. Of the 37 and 32 remnant nasopharyngeal samples positive by RT-qPCR, respectively, three were positive by the BIOCREDIT COVID-19 Ag and 14 were detected by the isothermal amplification assay. In conclusion, in the clinical settings we recorded that each of the RT-qPCR assays was superior to other test formats, in particular, the routine use of the DNA-technology assay is recommended. Although alternative recommendations exist, we belive that the use of isothermal amplifiaction assays and antigen rapid tests for COVID-19 diagnosis can only serve as adjuncts while awaiting the PCR result because of their high false-negative rate.","Kenyeres, Bence; Ánosi, Noel; Bányai, Krisztián; Mátyus, Mária; Orosz, László; Kiss, Andrea; Kele, Beatrix; Burián, Katalin; Lengyel, György",J Virol Methods,184,21

The objective: To analyze the specific parameters of care for critically ill patients with the novel coronavirus infection in Pavlov Multidisciplinary Medical Center. Subjects and methods. This is a result-based report on the work performed by the Infection Center, which was deployed twice in Pavlov Multidisciplinary Medical Center (from 28.04.2020 to 03.08.2020 and from 01.11.2020 to 15.03.2021). Totally, 3,830 patients with SARS-CoV-2 were managed (1,680 patients during the first deployment and 2,150 patients during the second one). In the preparatory period, the operation of the emergency department based on the inpatient emergency medical department (EMD) had been simulated to clarify its staff structure and the procedure for admission, examination, and treatment of patients. Here we compare the organizational approaches during the first and second waves of the pandemic and present the characteristics of the demographic data of the treated patients, the incidence of certain complications, and outcomes. Results. The overall lethality in the Center made 6.2%. Despite the experience gained in the first wave, the results of treatment during the second wave (autumn-winter) did not improve (5.7% died in the first wave and 6.7% in the second one). Lethality in ICU and EMD was 40.0% and 49.6%, in ICU only 38.5% and 46.9% respectively. A moderate lethality increase in ICU was due to the concentration of critically ill and most critically ill patients. There were 51.4% of patients with comorbidities and 53.5% were above 65 years of age. Refinement and differentiation of tasks performed by departments, simulation of the operation of the Center before opening made it possible to increase the throughput of the medical unit avoiding rush during admission and deterioration the quality of treatment. Conclusion. Certain aspects of the organization of medical care affect the performance of a multidisciplinary medical institution transformed into an infectious diseases hospital.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in SARS-CoV-2 infected outpatients with OGD. Weekly phone interviews were set up starting from COVID-19 onset symptoms and over the course of 60 days, using standardized questionnaires that included a detailed description of general symptoms and OGD. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with complete recovery of OGD at D30. Rate and time to recovery of OGD, as well as risk factors for late recovery (>30 days), were evaluated using Cox regression models. RESULTS: Ninety-eight outpatients were included. The median time to onset of OGD after first COVID-19 symptoms was 2 days (IQR 0-4). The 30-day recovery rate from OGD was 67.5% (95% CI 57.1-75.4) and the estimated median time of OGD recovery was 20 days (95% CI 13-26).

The 1,2,4-triazole scaffold was selected as a privilege ring system that is embedded in core structures of a variety of anticancer drugs which are either in clinical use or still under clinical trials. The designed 1,2,4-triazole derivatives were synthesized by linking the triazole-thione moiety through amide hydrophilic linkers with diverse lipophilic fragments. In silico study to predict cytotoxicity of the new hybrids against different kinds of human cancer cell lines as well as the non-tumor cells was conducted. The multidrug-resistant human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231) was found most susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of synthesized compounds and hence were selected to evaluate the in vitro anticancer activity. Four of the designed derivatives showed promising cytotoxicity effects against selected cancer cells, among which compound 12 showed the highest potency (IC50 = 3.61 µM), followed by 21 which displayed IC50 value of 3.93 µM. Also, compounds 14 and 23 revealed equipotent activity with the reference cytotoxic agent doxorubicin. To reinforce these observations, the obtained data of in vitro cytotoxicity have been validated in terms of ligand-protein interaction and new compounds were analyzed for ADMET properties to evaluate their potential to build up as good drug candidates.

Objective: We aim to explore the clinical and immunological features of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among COVID-19 patients. Design and Methods: In this retrospective study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 306 hospitalized confirmed COVID-19 patients (including 129 diabetic and 177 non-diabetic patients) were analyzed. The serum concentrations of laboratory parameters including cytokines and numbers of immune cells were measured and compared between diabetic and non-diabetic groups. Results: Compared with non-diabetic group, diabetic cases more frequently had lymphopenia and hyperglycemia, with higher levels of urea nitrogen, myoglobin, D-dimer and ferritin. Diabetic cases indicated the obviously elevated mortality and the higher levels of cytokines IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;, as well as the distinctly reduced Th1/Th2 cytokines ratios compared with non-diabetic cases. The longitudinal assays showed that compared to that at week 1, the levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly elevated at week 2 after admission in non-survivors of diabetic cases, whereas there were greatly reductions from week 1 to week 2 in survivors of diabetic cases. Compared with survival diabetic patients, non-survival diabetic cases displayed distinct higher serum concentrations of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-&#945;, and lower Th1/Th2 cytokines ratios at week 2. Samples from a subset of participants were evaluated by flow cytometry for the immune cells. The counts of peripheral total T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NK cells were markedly lower in diabetic cases than in non-diabetic cases. The non-survivors showed the markedly declined counts of CD8+ T cells and NK cells than survivors. Conclusion: The elevated cytokines, imbalance of Th1/Th2 cytokines ratios and reduced of peripheral numbers of CD8+ T cells and NK cells might contribute to the pathogenic mechanisms of high mortality of COVID-19 patients with T2DM.","Han, Meifang; Ma, Ke; Wang, Xiaojing; Yan, Weiming; Wang, Hongwu; You, Jie; Wang, Qiuxia; Chen, Huilong; Guo, Wei; Chen, Tao; Ning, Qin; Luo, Xiaoping",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),184,16

In response, we developed SalivaDirect, which received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Methods: We simplified our saliva-based diagnostic test by (1) not requiring collection tubes with preservatives, (2) replacing nucleic acid extraction with a simple enzymatic and heating step, and (3) testing specimens with a dualplex qRT-PCR assay. Moreover, we validated SalivaDirect with reagents and instruments from multiple vendors to minimize supply chain issues. Findings: From our hospital cohort, we show a high positive agreement (94%) between saliva tested with SalivaDirect and nasopharyngeal swabs tested with a commercial qRT-PCR kit. In partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), we tested 3,779 saliva specimens from healthy individuals and detected low rates of invalid (0.3%) and false-positive (<0.05%) results. Conclusions: We demonstrate that saliva is a valid alternative to swabs for SARS-CoV-2 screening and that SalivaDirect can make large-scale testing more accessible and affordable. Uniquely, we can designate other laboratories to use our sensitive, flexible, and simplified platform under our EUA (https://publichealth.yale.edu/salivadirect/).

However, uncertainty remains over optimal times to draw serum cortisol levels. OBJECTIVE: To determine optimal times to draw serum cortisol levels for the LDST in neonates. DESIGN: A retrospective chart review of LDSTs performed on neonates between January 1, 2009-September 30, 2017. SETTING: CHEO, a tertiary-care outborn pediatric center. PATIENTS: Forty-nine patients were included; 23(46.9%) born at term, 12(24.5%) born very preterm to late preterm, and 14(28.6%) born extremely preterm. INTERVENTION: Cortisol levels were drawn at baseline, 15, 30, and 60 minutes following administration of Cortrosyn TM 1mcg/kg (maximum dose 1mcg). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Timing of peak cortisol level and marginal value of drawing a second and third cortisol sample at 15, 30 or 60 minutes was determined. RESULTS: Cortisol peaked at 15-, 30- and 60-minute sampling times for 4%, 27% and 69 % of patients. The probability that a failed LDST changes to a pass by adding a 15- or 30-minute sample to the superior 60 minute sample is 5.6% (1-25.8%) and 11% (3.1-32.6%) respectively, for a cortisol pass threshold of 18.1mcg/dL (500nmol/L). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to studies of older children, we found that the majority of neonatal LDST cortisol peaks occurred at the 60-minute sampling time with the addition of a 30 minute sample providing substantial benefit. It is questionable if a 15-minute sample provides any benefit, making a case to revise LDST protocols to sample cortisol later for neonates.","LeDrew, Robyn; Bariciak, Erika; Webster, Richard; Barrowman, Nick; Ahmet, Alexandra",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,184,5

This is seen in the current COVID-19 pandemic, as alveolar epithelium is one of the major targets of SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Thus, it is essential to understand the mechanisms to maintain the integrity of alveoli epithelium. Alveolar type II (AT2) cells behave as tissue stem cells that repair alveoli epithelium in steady-state replacement and after injury. However, not all AT2 cells are equal in their ability for self-renewal or differentiation. Through marker gene identification, lineage tracing, and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), distinct subpopulations of AT2 cells have been identified that play the progenitor role in different context. The revelation of AT2 heterogeneity has brought new insights into the role of AT2 cells in various lung disease settings and potentiates the finding of more therapeutics targets. In this mini review, we discussed the recently identified subpopulations of AT2 cells and their functions under steady state, after injury and in pathological conditions.","Chen, Qian; Liu, Yuru",,184,16

We also use Hs and Fs to rank the COVID-19 lethality in these countries based on the complexity hierarchy. Our results suggest that the most proactive countries implemented measures such as facemasks, social distancing, quarantine, massive population testing, and hygienic (sanitary) orientations to limit the impacts of COVID-19, which implied lower entropy (higher predictability) to the COVID-19 lethality. In contrast, the most reactive countries implementing these measures depicted higher entropy (lower predictability) to the COVID-19 lethality.

Maternity services, including antenatal care, labour and delivery as well as postnatal care have been affected directly and indirectly by the pandemic and resultant control interventions, with delays introduced at several points across the continuum of care. Unfortunately, maternity conditions are time-sensitive, and delays can negatively impact feto-maternal outcomes, with increased maternal, fetal or neonatal morbidity and mortality. An audit at central hospitals revealed reduced utilisation of maternity services and a trend towards an increase in maternal mortality. A formal evaluation is required; however, mitigating public health interventions are required, especially as the burden of COVID-19 in the country has considerably come down. The World Health Organisation offers useful technical guidance for maintaining essential health services in pandemic times in low-resources settings, and rationalising the use of personal protective equipment, which can be contextualised and adopted to restore and maintain essential health services. Restoration of essential maternity services is urgently required in an environment that protects healthcare workers and their clients, minimising their risk of contracting COVID-19 whilst optimising fetomaternal outcomes. Thus, the various stakeholders involved in maternity care must urgently come together and find ways of achieving this goal.","Murewanhema, Grant; Nyakanda, Munyaradzi Innocent; Madziyire, Mugove Gerald",Pan Afr Med J,184,24

METHODS: This is a descriptive, multicentre, observational study in nine tertiary care hospitals throughout Spain. The study population was women with coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy. Mother-to-child transmission was defined as positive real-time RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, placenta or neonatal nasopharyngeal swabs taken immediately after birth. RESULTS: We included 43 women with singleton pregnancies and one with a twin pregnancy, as a result we obtained 45 samples of placenta, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood. The median gestational age at diagnosis was 34.7 weeks (range 14-41.3 weeks). The median interval between positive RT-PCR and delivery was 21.5 days (range 0-141 days). Fourteen women (31.8%, 95% CI 18.6%-47.6%) were positive at the time of delivery. There was one singleton pregnancy with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive in the placenta, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood (2.2%, 95% CI 0.1%-11.8%). Nasopharyngeal aspiration was performed on 38 neonates at birth, all of which were negative (0%, 95% CI 0%-9.3%). In 11 neonates the nasopharyngeal aspiration was repeated at 24-48 hours, and one returned positive (9.1%, 95% CI 0.2%-41.3%).

The study was approved by the Hamad Medical Corporation Institutional Review Board (IRB) (MRC-05–072). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics.ResultThe majority (n = 92) of 100 included patients were male and median age was 43 years. Patients were of diverse background with majority of South Asian (Indian, Pakistani, Bengali, Nepalese, and Afghan) (n = 60), followed by Qatari (n = 18) background. Mean length of hospital stay was 26.51 days.35 patients had severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia, and 67 had at least one underlying physical comorbidity. Significant psychosocial stressors other than positive SARS-Cov-2 status, including lockdown, quarantine, finances and relationships issues were identified in 48 patients.A total of 35 patients had a positive past psychiatric history, out of which 17 were on maintenance psychotropic medications. Insomnia was the commonest psychiatric symptom (n = 65), followed by anxiety (n = 52), agitation (n = 42), depression (n = 39), changes in appetite (n = 32) and irritability (n = 30). The principal psychiatric diagnoses made were delirium (n = 29), acute stress reaction or adjustment disorder (n = 25), depression (n = 16), mania (n = 15), anxiety (n = 14), non-affective psychosis (n = 13), and dementia (n = 6). Approximately half of the patients with mania or non-affective psychosis had it as their first-onset disorder.ConclusionSARS-CoV-2, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, is associated with a wide range of psychiatric morbidity which emphasizes clinicians’ vigilance for psychiatric symptoms. Insomnia was the commonest neuropsychiatric symptom which may have clinical practice and potential preventive strategies implications.Delirium, the commonest diagnosis in the study carries high morbidity and mortality and may reflect SARS-Cov-2 propensity to affect the brain directly and indirectly through a cytokine storm, organ failure, and prothrombotic state. Patients can also present with new-onset mania or non-affective psychosis. It is noteworthy that about two-thirds of the patients had no past psychiatric history.This study, along with expanding body of evidence may assist with resource allocation and liaison psychiatry services planning. It also underscores the importance of designing future studies to better understand longer-term psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19.","Yousaf, Iqbal Haddad Peter Latoo Javed Alabdulla Majid Sultan Albrahim Kumar Rajeev Wadoo Ovais",BJPsych Open,184,16

We argue for inhibition of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) calcium-permeable ion channel as a strategy to address this issue, based on the rationale that TRPV4 inhibition is protective in various preclinical models of lung edema and that TRPV4 hyperactivation potently damages the alveolo-capillary barrier, with lethal outcome. We believe that TRPV4 inhibition has a powerful prospect at protecting this vital barrier in COVID-19 patients, even to rescue a damaged barrier. A clinical trial using a selective TRPV4 inhibitor demonstrated a benign safety profile in healthy volunteers and in patients suffering from cardiogenic lung edema. We argue for expeditious clinical testing of this inhibitor in COVID-19 patients with respiratory malfunction and at risk for lung edema. Perplexingly, among the currently pursued therapeutic strategies against COVID-19, none is designed to directly protect the alveolo-capillary barrier. Successful protection of the alveolo-capillary barrier will not only reduce COVID-19 lethality but will also preempt a distressing healthcare scenario with insufficient capacity to provide ventilator-assisted respiration.","Kuebler, Wolfgang M; Jordt, Sven-Eric; Liedtke, Wolfgang B",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,184,20

Pharmacists can perform multifaceted tasks in hypertension management such as measuring blood pressure. In a time where the use of educational videos in health professions education has increased, an educational video might be an option for teaching blood pressure measurement skills to pharmacy students. This project aimed to develop an educational video tailored to pharmacy students on oscillometric blood pressure measurement in a community pharmacy setting that can be used as a self-instruction video. Methods: The video was created with support from the university's multimedia center. The video development was roughly divided into pre-production, production, and post-production. Students' satisfaction with and perception of the video was surveyed. Results: An 11-minute 33-second self-instruction video in the German language on proper oscillometric blood pressure measurement tailored for pharmacy students was created. Along with descriptive slides, the video delineates the necessary steps of blood pressure measurement in a community pharmacy setting in a role-play, to support students in communication with the patient. Results of a survey on the satisfaction and perception of the video from thirty-seven pharmacy students were included in the analysis and revealed that the video was well accepted by pharmacy students. Moreover, approximately 95% responded that instructional videos should be included in future pharmacy education. Conclusion: We successfully developed an educational video on oscillometric blood pressure measurement for a community pharmacy setting. This work is a valuable form of support for faculty members, who intend to develop educational videos. This might be of interest especially during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, where distance learning has become highly relevant.","Farahani, S.; Farahani, I.; Burckhardt, B.

They also carefully design an objective function or loss function (often with multiple objectives) that captures the desired output for a given ML task such as classification, regression, etc. In multi-objective optimization, conflicting objectives and constraints is a major area of concern. In such problems, several competing objectives are seen for which no single optimal solution is found that satisfies all desired objectives simultaneously. In the past VA systems have allowed users to interactively construct objective functions for a classifier. In this paper, we extend this line of work by prototyping a technique to visualize multi-objective objective functions either defined in a Jupyter notebook or defined using an interactive visual interface to help users to: (1) perceive and interpret complex mathematical terms in it and (2) detect and resolve conflicting objectives. Visualization of the objective function enlightens potentially conflicting objectives that obstructs selecting correct solution(s) for the desired ML task or goal. We also present an enumeration of potential conflicts in objective specification in multi-objective objective functions for classifier selection. Furthermore, we demonstrate our approach in a VA system that helps users in specifying meaningful objective functions to a classifier by detecting and resolving conflicting objectives and constraints. Through a within-subject quantitative and qualitative user study, we present results showing that our technique helps users interactively specify meaningful objective functions by resolving potential conflicts for a classification task.","Das, Subhajit; Endert, Alex",,184,33

A series of unprecedented shocks is straining the capacity of food assistance organizations to reach vulnerable populations. We discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the demand and the supply of international food assistance, and we propose three policy changes that can keep food flowing to those in need. First, donor countries can prioritize humanitarian spending in aid-allocation decisions. Second, governments can exempt food assistance from trade barriers that impede procurement (export restrictions) and delivery (import tariffs). Third, donor countries can allow flexibility for implementing agencies by untying food assistance from domestic procurement and shipping restrictions. All of these proposals are regulatory changes that can be made without requiring increased spending. These options are particularly relevant now because donor-country governments are entering economic recessions, and foreign aid budgets will be constrained.","Cardwell, Ryan; Ghazalian, Pascal L.",World Dev.,184,24

This paper aims to understand how the Net.Create network visualization tool would support students as they tried to understand the many complex interactions in a historical text in a remote learning environment and how sustained knowledge building using Net.Create would shape student attitudes toward remote learning, collaboration and engagement. Design/methodology/approach: This paper explores changes in engagement and learning in a survey-level history course on the black death after a shift to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors used activity theory to focus the adaptation of Net.Create, a web-based collaborative social-network-analysis tool and to understand how it supported group-based remote learning. The authors describe how the redesigned activities sustained engagement with historical content and report coded student network entries, reading responses and surveys to illustrate changes in engagement and learning. Findings: The results suggest that students benefit from personal connections to historical content and their peers. Net.Create supported both through collaborative knowledge-building activities and reflection on how their quarantine experiences compared to the historical content they read. It is possible to avoid student frustrations with traditional “group work” even in a remote environment by supporting collaborative learning using Net.Create and a mix of individual and group contributions.

GWAS focuses on identifying single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with certain diseases such as cancer and diabetes, and the chi-squared (&#967;2) hypothesis test of independence can be utilized for this identification. However, recent studies have shown that publishing the results of &#967;2 tests of SNPs or personal data could lead to privacy violations. Several studies have proposed anonymization methods for &#967;2 testing with Îµ-differential privacy, which is the cryptographic community's de facto privacy metric. However, existing methods can only be applied to 2×2 or 2×3 contingency tables, otherwise their accuracy is low for small numbers of samples. It is difficult to collect numerous high-sensitive samples in many cases such as COVID-19 analysis in its early propagation stage. RESULTS: We propose a novel anonymization method (RandChiDist), which anonymizes &#967;2 testing for small samples. We prove that RandChiDist satisfies differential privacy. We also experimentally evaluate its analysis using synthetic datasets and real two genomic datasets. RandChiDist achieved the least number of Type II errors among existing and baseline methods that can control the ratio of Type I errors. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a new differentially private method, named RandChiDist, for anonymizing &#967;2 values for an I×J contingency table with a small number of samples. The experimental results show that RandChiDist outperforms existing methods for small numbers of samples.","Sei, Yuichi; Ohsuga, Akihiko",BioData Min,184,11

In cardiac and aortic surgery, as it is with most specialities, elective surgeries were halted. AIMS OF THE STUDY: We captured reflections, contingencies, and current practices across of high-volume centers in cardiac and aortic surgery globally. We also aimed this study to assess decision on prioritization of the surgical patients, the need for personal protection equipment, and the choice of preoperative investigations in current dynamic and fluid climate. METHODS: A validated web-based questionnaire was constructed and was circulated to the international surgeons amongst high volume cardiac and aortic surgery centers. Their intrinsic feedback on decision making, the impact of the lockdown, and perspectives for the future ahead of us all were noted. A mixed-method approach was constructed. Qualitative data analysis was introduced to signify the impact globally. RESULTS: Overall, 23 centers from 18 countries participated in this international study. About 91.7% of the respondents stopped operating on elective patients during the pandemic. The majority of the surgeons agreed that acute aortic dissection (87.1%) should be operated as an emergency procedure and stable triple vessel disease (87.1%) to be considered as an elective procedure. Three-fifth (60%) of the respondents relied on computerized tomography chest as a preoperative screening modality.

Crowding, pollution, noise, inadequate lighting, lack of access to green spaces, and other environmental factors associated with slums can exacerbate mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, violence, and other forms of social dysfunction. METHOD: The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation. RESULTS: Experts say that people who sleep in shelters or on the streets already have lower life expectancy, suffer from addiction, and have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk should they develop the virus. There are just so many competing and unmet needs, which makes it much harder for homeless to contend with all of this. If exposed, people experiencing homelessness might be more susceptible to illness or death due to the prevalence of underlying physical and mental medical conditions and a lack of reliable and affordable health care. Nevertheless, without an urgent solution, people experiencing homelessness will remain in limbo. CONCLUSIONS: Many people living on the streets already have a diminished health condition, higher rates of chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, all of which are risk factors for developing a more serious manifestation of the coronavirus infection. Those suffering from mental illness may have difficulty in recognizing and responding to the threat of infection. Homeless people have less access to health care providers who could otherwise order diagnostic testing and, if confirmed, isolate them from others in coordination with local health departments.","Lima, Nádia Nara Rolim; de Souza, Ricardo Inácio; Feitosa, Pedro Walisson Gomes; Moreira, Jorge Lucas de Sousa; da Silva, Claudio Gleidiston Lima; Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim",Psychiatry Res,184,19

The research aimed to describe and compare the health status of Chinese people both domestically and abroad in this global health crisis. An online questionnaire survey was distributed to Chinese mainland citizens living in Hubei (the lockdown province), outside Hubei, and those living abroad in 2020. A total of 1000 respondents were recruited and reported worse health status compared with Chinese population norms. People living in Hubei reported worse health status than those living outside Hubei but revealed better health status than overseas respondents. It was clear that the pandemic as well as strict lockdown and outdoor restriction policies affected Chinese people's health. It is important for the Chinese government to be aware of the negative impact of such strict policies and to take measures to reduce the panic of society when implementing similar policies in the future. It also implies that governments in other countries should promote social support for those who live far from home and actively call for support for non-discriminatory attitudes toward ethnic minorities.","Mao, Zhuxin; Chen, Bohao; Wang, Wei; Kind, Paul; Wang, Pei",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),184,15

Imaging studies, especially computed tomography (CT) of the chest, have gained importance since the beginning of the pandemic. CT can help diagnose COVID-19, assess the extent of pulmonary involvement, and predict the disease severity. We aimed to define the frequency of persistent symptoms and correlate their presence with the results of laboratory findings and the severity of the disease based on the findings of chest CT. METHODS: We examined patients discharged from the hospital after treatment for COVID-19 and whose nasopharyngeal swab sample tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 after at least 4 weeks from the initial diagnosis. The patients were asked about the presence of persisting symptoms. In addition to the demographic data, laboratory results and severity levels seen on the chest CT were recorded. RESULTS: In all, 116 patients were included in the study, of which 61 reported at least one persisting symptom (52.5%). The mean age of the study population was 48.90 ± 17.74 years. The persistent symptoms included shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, muscle weakness, dizziness, headache, fatigue, and palpitations. The mean CT severity score was 3.80 ± 0.38 and it was lower in patients without any persistent symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of C-reactive protein and fibrinogen, anemia, and female sex were associated with some of the persistent symptoms., the severity of the disease seen on CT was a successful predictor for the disease severity/prognosis and was also correlated with prolonged COVID infection and more persistent symptoms.","Aydin, Sonay; Unver, Edhem; Karavas, Erdal; Yalcin, Seven; Kantarci, Mecit",Respir Investig,184,1

This paper presents differences in patterns of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 in the Arab, ultra-Orthodox and overall populations in Israel, and suggests possible reasons for the low rates of infection in the Arab population. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Israeli Ministry of Health's (MOH) open COVID-19 database, which includes information on 1270 localities and is updated daily. The database contains the number of COVID-19 diagnostic tests performed, the number of confirmed cases and deaths in Israel. RESULTS: In the first 4 months of Israel's COVID-19 outbreak, just 2060 cases were confirmed in the Arab population, comprising 8.8% of the 23,345 confirmed cases, or 2.38 times less than would be expected relative to the population size. In contrast, the ultra-Orthodox made up 30.1% of confirmed cases yet just 10.1% of the population. Confirmed case rate per 100,000 was twice as high in the general Jewish population compared to the Arab population. The Arab mortality rate was 0.57 per 100,000, compared to 3.37 in the overall population, and to 7.26 in the ultra-Orthodox community. We discuss possible reasons for this low morbidity and mortality including less use of nursing homes, and effective leadership which led to early closure of mosques and high adherence to social distancing measures, even during the month of Ramadan. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a disproportionate burden of underlying illness, the Arab population did not fulfil initial predictions during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak and maintained low numbers of infections and deaths. This contrasts with reports of increased mortality in ethnic minorities and economically disadvantaged populations in other countries, and with high rates of infection in the ultra-Orthodox sector in Israel. Effective leadership and cooperation between individuals and institutions, particularly engagement of community and religious leaders, can reduce a group's vulnerability and build resilience in an emergency situation such as the current pandemic.","Saban, Mor; Myers, Vicki; Wilf-Miron, Rachel",Int J Equity Health,184,1

Applying the principle of controlling hazards at the source is argued in this context to call for an understanding of the upstream production and socio-political factors that are jointly affecting the nature of work and employment and their impact on the health of workers, the public, and the planet.","Loewenson, Rene",New Solut,184,16

The purpose of our study was to objectively assess smell impairment in COVID-19 patients and to correlate olfactory function with viral recovery. METHODS: Between 15 and 30 April 2020, hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent an objective assessment of olfactory function with the Smell Identification subtest of the Sniffin' Sticks Test (SI-SST). Association between viral recovery and SI-SST performance was evaluated. RESULTS: 51 patients were enrolled (49% males, mean age 66.2 ± 14.6 years). At the time of test administration, 45% were clinically recovered and 39% were virus-free. Objective hyposmia/anosmia was found in 45% of the patients. Subjective olfactory disorders showed no association with the clinical or viral recovery status of the patients. On the contrary, none of the patients with anosmia and the 5% of hyposmic patients at test had viral recovery. The relative risk for hyposmic patients to be still positive at swab test was 10.323 (95% CI 1.483-71.869, p < .0001).

We explored whether UK residents with more frequent or supportive social contact had fewer depressive symptoms during March-August 2020, and potential factors moderating the relationship. METHODS: A convenience sample of UK dwelling participants aged â©¾18 in the internet-based longitudinal COVID-19 Social Study completed up to 22 weekly questionnaires about face-to-face and phone/video social contact frequency, perceived social support, and depressive symptoms using the PHQ-9. Mixed linear models examined associations between social contact and support, and depressive symptoms. We examined for interaction by empathic concern, perspective taking and pre-COVID social contact frequency. RESULTS: In 71 117 people with mean age 49 years (standard deviation 15), those with high perceived social support scored 1.836 (1.801-1.871) points lower on PHQ-9 than those with low support. Daily face-to-face or phone/video contact was associated with lower depressive symptoms (0.258 (95% confidence interval 0.225-0.290) and 0.117 (0.080-0.154), respectively) compared to no contact. The negative association between social relationships and depressive symptoms was stronger for those with high empathic concern, perspective taking and usual sociability. CONCLUSIONS: We found during lockdown that those with higher quality or more face-to-face or phone/video contact had fewer depressive symptoms. Contact quality was more strongly associated than quantity. People who were usually more sociable or had higher empathy had more depressive symptoms during enforced reduced contact. The results have implications for COVID-19 and potential future pandemic management, and for understanding the relationship between social factors and mental health.","Sommerlad, Andrew; Marston, Louise; Huntley, Jonathan; Livingston, Gill; Lewis, Gemma; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",Psychol Med,184,25

Various laboratory assays have been employed in the diagnosis of COVID-19, including: nucleic acid-based tests; antigen tests; and serum testing for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. The disease can also be diagnosed based on suggestive clinical features and radiological findings. Until now, remdesivir is the only medication approved for the treatment of COVID-19 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, it is anticipated that several anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies will gain soon approval. Other methods of treatment include supportive care directed toward treating the symptoms. Nevertheless, many studies have recently emerged, showing controversial preliminary results with the off-label medication hydroxychloroquine. Given that all results are still preliminary, including those seen by remdesivir, additional evidence and research are required to identify effective medications that are broadly effective and well tolerated. Importantly, two RNA-based vaccines have recently gained approval from Pfizer and Moderna, with many others still in clinical trials.

However, only a few studies have investigated the effect of training on highly automated driving. Moreover, available interactive trainings are mostly based on automated driving simulators and the application of immersive technology such as Virtual Reality (VR) as a low-cost training solution has not been widely adopted. In this study, we developed three types of familiarization tours (low-fidelity VR, high-fidelity VR, and video) to train first-time users of highly automated cars. Then, the effectiveness of these tours was investigated on automation trust and driving performance in several critical and non-critical transition tasks in four groups: control, video, low-fidelity VR, and high-fidelity VR. The results revealed the positive impact of the tours on trust and transition performance at the first time of measurement. Takeover quality only improved when practices were presented in high-fidelity VR. After three times of exposure to transition requests, trust and transition performance of all groups converged to those of the high-fidelity VR group, demonstrating that: a) experiencing takeover transition during the training may reduce costs associated with first critical takeover request in highly automated driving, b) the VR tour with high level of interaction fidelity was superior to other training methods, and c) untrained and less-trained drivers learned about automation after a few trials. Knowledge resulting from this research could help develop cost-effective solutions for automated driving training in dealerships and car rental centers.","Ebnali, Mahdi; Lamb, Richard; Fathi, Razieh; Hulme, Kevin",Appl Ergon,184,16

Objective: To identify risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 incidence, hospitalization, and mortality among nursing home residents in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted in long-stay residents aged 65 years or older with fee-for-service Medicare residing in 15â¯038 US nursing homes from April 1, 2020, to September 30, 2020. Data were analyzed from November 22, 2020, to February 10, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was risk of diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 (per International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-10-CM] codes) by September 30 and hospitalization or death within 30 days after diagnosis. Three-level (resident, facility, and county) logistic regression models and competing risk models conditioned on nursing home facility were used to determine association of patient characteristics with outcomes. Results: Among 482â¯323 long-stay residents included, the mean (SD) age was 82.7 (9.2) years, with 326â¯861 (67.8%) women, and 383â¯838 residents (79.6%) identifying as White. Among 137â¯119 residents (28.4%) diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 during follow up, 29â¯204 residents (21.3%) were hospitalized, and 26â¯384 residents (19.2%) died within 30 days. Nursing homes explained 37.2% of the variation in risk of infection, while county explained 23.4%. Risk of infection increased with increasing body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) (eg, BMI>45 vs BMI 18.5-25: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.15-1.24) but varied little by other resident characteristics. Risk of hospitalization after SARS-CoV-2 increased with increasing BMI (eg, BMI>45 vs BMI 18.5-25: aHR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.28-1.52); male sex (aHR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.29-1.35); Black (aHR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.24-1.32), Hispanic (aHR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.15-1.26), or Asian (aHR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.36-1.57) race/ethnicity; impaired functional status (eg, severely impaired vs not impaired: aHR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.10-1.22); and increasing comorbidities, such as renal disease (aHR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.18-1.24) and diabetes (aHR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.13-1.18). Risk of mortality increased with age (eg, age >90 years vs 65-70 years: aHR, 2.55; 95% CI, 2.44-2.67), impaired cognition (eg, severely impaired vs not impaired: aHR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.71-1.86), and functional impairment (eg, severely impaired vs not impaired: aHR, 1.94; 1.83-2.05). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that among long-stay nursing home residents, risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with county and facility of residence, while risk of hospitalization and death after SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with facility and individual resident characteristics. For many resident characteristics, there were substantial differences in risk of hospitalization vs mortality. This may represent resident preferences, triaging decisions, or inadequate recognition of risk of death.","Mehta, Hemalkumar B; Li, Shuang; Goodwin, James S",JAMA Netw Open,184,13

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause excess mortality both directly and indirectly by increasing deaths from other diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on mortality in Oman. METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective analysis of mortality data from 1 January 2015 to 16 August 2020 was undertaken. Baseline mortality estimated using the Farrington flexible model and excess mortality were calculated for the pandemic period (16 March-16 August 2020) according to cause of death, place of death and age group. RESULTS: During the pandemic period, there was a 15% [95% confidence interval (CI) 14-17] increase in all-cause mortality from baseline. When classifying by cause, there was a 9% (95% CI 5-12) increase in deaths due to respiratory diseases, a 2% (95% CI 1-4) increase in deaths due to infectious diseases and a 9% (95% CI 8-11) increase in unclassified deaths.

Since the current pandemic of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a great concern for everybody in the World, the frequently asked question is how and when the COVID-19 process will be concluded. The aim of this paper is to propose hypotheses in order to answer this essential question. As recently demonstrated, SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the human genome. Our main hypothesis is that the ultimate aim of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the incorporation to human genome and being an element of the intestinal virobiota. Materials and methods: We propose that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic incorporation to be a part of human virobiota is essentially based on three pathobiological phases which are called as the 'induction', 'consolidation', and 'maintenance phases'. The phase of 'recurrence' complicates any of these three disease phases based on the viral load, exposure time, and more contagious strains and/or mutants. We have performed the 'random walk model' in order to predict the community transmission kinetics of the virus. Results: Chimerism-mediated immunotherapy at the individual and community level with the help of vaccination seems to be the only option for ending the COVID-19 process. After the integration of SARS-CoV-2 virus into the human genome via the induction, consolidation, and maintenance phases as an element of intestinal virobiota, the chimerism would be concluded. The 'viral load', the 'genomic strain of the SARS-CoV-2', and 'host immune reaction against the SARS-CoV-2' are the hallmarks of this long journey. Conclusion: Elucidation of the functional viral dynamics will be helpful for disease management at the individual- and community- based long-term management strategies.","Türk, Seyhan; Türk, Can; Malkan, Ümit Yavuz; Temirci, Elif Sena; Peker, Mustafa Çagri; Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim Celalettin",Turk J Med Sci,184,20

Motivated by the effectiveness in propagating the disease through the virus, a new bio-inspired and population-based optimization algorithm is proposed. This paper presents a novel metaheuristic algorithm named Ebola optimization algorithm (EOSA). To correctly achieve this, this study models the propagation mechanism of the Ebola virus disease, emphasising all consistent states of the propagation. The model was further represented using a mathematical model based on first-order differential equations. After that, the combined propagation and mathematical models were adapted for developing the new metaheuristic algorithm. To evaluate the proposed method's performance and capability compared with other optimization methods, the underlying propagation and mathematical models were first investigated to determine how they successfully simulate the EVD. Furthermore, two sets of benchmark functions consisting of forty-seven (47) classical and over thirty (30) constrained IEEE CEC-2017 benchmark functions are investigated numerically. The results indicate that the performance of the proposed algorithm is competitive with other state-of-the-art optimization methods based on scalability analysis, convergence analysis, and sensitivity analysis. Extensive simulation results indicate that the EOSA outperforms other state-of-the-art popular metaheuristic optimization algorithms such as the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (ABC) on some shifted, high dimensional and large search range problems.","Oyelade, Olaide N.; Ezugwu, Absalom E.",,184,19

In addition, SARS-CoV-2 has been purportedly linked to multiple cutaneous manifestations, among them chilblain-like skin lesions, also known as ""COVID toes."" Driven in large part by social media, dermatologists around the world reported a dramatic increase in the frequency of chilblain-like diagnoses early in the COVID-19 pandemic, often in members of the same family. This phenomenon has been captured in a rapidly expanding medical literature. As of this writing, the chilblain-like presentation has been reported to occur predominantly in younger, minimally symptomatic patients and to emerge late in the COVID-19 disease course. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not consistently found when these patients are evaluated by polymerase chain reaction. A robust antiviral immune response in young patients that induces microangiopathic changes has been posited as a mechanism. Herein we review the rapid evolution of the literature regarding chilblain-like skin lesions early in the COVID-19 global pandemic.","Massey, Paul R; Jones, Krystal M",Semin Oncol,184,24

There is lack of research into the production of effective vaccines and methods of treatment against viral infections. As of now, strategies encompassing antiviral drugs and corticosteroids alongside mechanical respiratory treatment are in practice as frontline treatments. Though studies have reported that microalgae possess antiviral properties, only a few cases have presented the existence of antiviral compounds such as algal polysaccharides, lectins, aggluttinins, scytovirin, algal lipids such as sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG), monogalactosyldiacylglycerides (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerides (DGDG), and algal biopigments especially chlorophyll analogues, marennine, phycobiliproteins, phycocyanin, phycoerythrin and allophycocyanin that are derived from marine and freshwater microalgae. Given the chemodiversity of bioactive compounds from microalgae and the present scenario, algal biotechnology is seen as a prospective source of antiviral and anti-inflammatory compounds that can be used to develop antiviral agents. Microalgae with potential as antivirals and microalgae derived functional compounds to treat viral diseases are summarized and can be used as a reference in developing algae-derived antivirals to treat SARS-CoV-2 and other similar viruses. © 2021, Editorial board of Journal of Experimental Biology and Agricultural Sciences.

These autoantibodies neutralized most type I IFNs but rarely IFN-beta. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to define the prevalence of autoantibodies neutralizing type I IFN in a cohort of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with IFN-beta-1b during hospitalization and to analyze their impact on various clinical variables and outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed stored serum/plasma samples and clinical data of COVID-19 patients treated subcutaneously with IFN-beta-1b from March to May 2020, at the Infanta Leonor University Hospital in Madrid, Spain. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 47 COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia, 16 of whom (34%) had a critical progression requiring ICU admission. The median age was 71 years, with 28 men (58.6%). Type I IFN-alpha- and omega-neutralizing autoantibodies were found in 5 of 47 patients with severe pneumonia or critical disease (10.6%), while they were not found in any of the 118 asymptomatic controls (p = 0.0016). The autoantibodies did not neutralize IFN-beta. No demographic, comorbidity, or clinical differences were seen between individuals with or without autoantibodies. We found a significant correlation between the presence of neutralizing autoantibodies and higher C-reactive protein levels (p = 5.10e-03) and lower lymphocyte counts (p = 1.80e-02). No significant association with response to IFN-beta-1b therapy (p = 0.34) was found. Survival analysis suggested that neutralizing autoantibodies may increase the risk of death (4/5, 80% vs 12/42, 28.5%). CONCLUSION: Autoantibodies neutralizing type I IFN underlie severe/critical COVID-19 stages in at least 10% of cases, correlate with increased C-RP and lower lymphocyte counts, and confer a trend towards increased risk of death. Subcutaneous IFN-beta treatment of hospitalized patients did not seem to improve clinical outcome. Studies of earlier, ambulatory IFN-beta treatment are warranted.","Troya, Jesús; Bastard, Paul; Planas-Serra, Laura; Ryan, Pablo; Ruiz, Montse; de Carranza, María; Torres, Juan; Martínez, Amalia; Abel, Laurent; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Pujol, Aurora",J. clin. immunol,184,1

The meaning of ""fever"" varies depending on the cutoff temperature used, the type of thermometer, the time of the day, the site of measurements, and the person's gender and race. The absence of a universally accepted definition for fever has been especially problematic during the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This investigation determined the extent to which fever is defined in COVID-19 publications, with special attention to those associated with pregnancy. RESULTS: Of 53 publications identified in which ""fever"" is reported as a manifestation of COVID-19 illness, none described the method used to measure patient's temperatures. Only 10 (19%) publications specified the minimum temperature used to define a fever with values that varied from a 37.3 °C (99.1 °F) to 38.1 °C (100.6 °F). CONCLUSIONS: There is a disturbing lack of precision in defining fever in COVID-19 publications. Given the many factors influencing temperature measurements in humans, there can never be a single, universally accepted temperature cut-off defining a fever. This clinical reality should not prevent precision in reporting fever. To achieve the precision and improve scientific and clinical communication, when fever is reported in clinical investigations, at a minimum the cut-off temperature used in determining the presence of fever, the anatomical site at which temperatures are taken, and the instrument used to measure temperatures should each be described. In the absence of such information, what is meant by the term ""fever"" is uncertain.","Grünebaum, Amos; Chervenak, Frank A; McCullough, Laurence B; Dudenhausen, Joachim W; Bornstein, Eran; Mackowiak, Philip A",J. perinat. med,184,11

Objective: To investigate the presence of sinonasal manifestations at the onset of COVID-19 to achieve an earlier diagnosis. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective telephone survey study investigated patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 5 to March 23, 2020, who were hospitalized or discharged from a single referral center. Patients who were unable to answer (intubated, receiving noninvasive ventilation, or deceased) or unreachable by telephone were excluded. Of 359 consecutive patients, 204 fulfilled the inclusion criteria; 76 were unable to answer, 76 were unreachable by telephone, and 3 refused. Exposures: Sinonasal manifestations reported before COVID-19 diagnosis were studied with a validated questionnaire: Italian Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 22 (I-SNOT-22). If reduction of taste and/or smell was documented by item 5 of the I-SNOT-22, further inquiries were made to score them separately on a scale from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no problem and 5 indicating problem as bad as it can be. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of sinonasal manifestations preceding COVID-19 diagnosis. Results: Among the 204 patients enrolled (110 [53.9%] male; mean [SD] age, 52.6 [14.4] years), the median I-SNOT-22 total score was 21 (range, 0-73). I-SNOT-22 identified 116 patients (56.9%) with reduction of taste and/or smell, 113 (55.4%) with taste reduction (median score, 5; range, 2-5), and 85 (41.7%) with smell reduction (median score, 5; range, 1-5). Eighty-two patients (40.2%) reported both. Severe reduction of taste was present in 81 patients (39.7%), and severe reduction of smell was present in 72 patients (35.3%). Only 12 patients (14.8%) with severe taste reduction and 12 patients (16.7%) with severe smell reduction reported severe nasal obstruction. Severe reduction of taste and smell was more prevalent in female vs male patients (odds ratios, 3.16 [95% CI, 1.76-5.67] vs 2.58 [95% CI, 1.43-4.65]) and middle-aged vs younger patients (effect sizes, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.21-0.78] vs 0.85 [95% CI, 0.55-1.15]). No significant association was observed between smoking habits and severe reduction of taste (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.53-1.71) and/or smell (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.35-1.21). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this telephone survey study suggest that reduction of taste and/or smell may be a frequent and early symptom of COVID-19. Nasal obstruction was not commonly present at the onset of the disease in this study. The general practitioner may play a pivotal role in identifying potential COVID-19 in patients at an early stage if taste and/or smell alterations manifest and in suggesting quarantine before confirmation or exclusion of the diagnosis.","Mercante, Giuseppe; Ferreli, Fabio; De Virgilio, Armando; Gaino, Francesca; Di Bari, Matteo; Colombo, Giovanni; Russo, Elena; Costantino, Andrea; Pirola, Francesca; Cugini, Giovanni; Malvezzi, Luca; Morenghi, Emanuela; Azzolini, Elena; Lagioia, Michele; Spriano, Giuseppe",JAMA otolaryngol.-- head neck surg.

Coronaviruses employ between 20 and 30 proteins to carry out their viral replication cycle, including infection, immune evasion, and replication. Among these, nonstructural protein 16 (Nsp16), a 2'-O-methyltransferase, plays an essential role in immune evasion. Nsp16 achieves this by mimicking its human homolog, CMTr1, which methylates mRNA to enhance translation efficiency and distinguish self from other. Unlike human CMTr1, Nsp16 requires a binding partner, Nsp10, to activate its enzymatic activity. The requirement of this binding partner presents two questions that we investigate in this manuscript. First, how does Nsp10 activate Nsp16? Although experimentally derived structures of the active Nsp16/Nsp10 complex exist, structures of inactive, monomeric Nsp16 have yet to be solved. Therefore, it is unclear how Nsp10 activates Nsp16. Using over 1 ms of molecular dynamics simulations of both Nsp16 and its complex with Nsp10, we investigate how the presence of Nsp10 shifts Nsp16's conformational ensemble to activate it. Second, guided by this activation mechanism and Markov state models, we investigate whether Nsp16 adopts inactive structures with cryptic pockets that, if targeted with a small molecule, could inhibit Nsp16 by stabilizing its inactive state. After identifying such a pocket in SARS-CoV2 Nsp16, we show that this cryptic pocket also opens in SARS-CoV1 and MERS but not in human CMTr1. Therefore, it may be possible to develop pan-coronavirus antivirals that target this cryptic pocket.","Vithani, Neha; Ward, Michael D; Zimmerman, Maxwell I; Novak, Borna; Borowsky, Jonathan H; Singh, Sukrit; Bowman, Gregory R",Biophys. j,184,20

We aimed to identify factors associated with changes in alcohol and tobacco consumption during the strictest period of PHSM 'lockdown'. METHODS: Logistic regression analysis were conducted using secondary data from the Central Statistics Office Social Impact Survey collected during lockdown in Ireland (April 23rd-May 1st, 2020). RESULTS: Of the 1,362 (33.8%) individuals that responded to the survey, 80.6% were current drinkers and 26.0% were smokers. The majority of smokers (60.9%) and drinkers (60.6%) reported no change in consumption. However, 30.5% of smokers and 22.2% of drinkers reported increased consumption. Being concerned about household stress from confinement (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.9, p = 0.002), working from home (aOR 2.1, 95 CI 1.4-3.3, p < 0.001) and urban living (aOR 2.0, 95 CI 1.5-2.9, p < 0.001) were associated with increases in alcohol consumption. Feeling very nervous (aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.0, p = 0.009), feeling downhearted/depressed (aOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.4, p = 0.004), being concerned about someone else's health (aOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.9, p = 0.031), working from home (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.0-5.3, p = 0.046) and increases in alcohol consumption (aOR 3.6, 95% CI 1.7-7.7, p = 0.023) were associated with increases in tobacco consumption. CONCLUSION: A mixed picture was evident in terms of changes in consumption among current smokers and drinkers. Increased consumption was more commonly reported than reductions. Increased consumption was associated with psychological distress and socio-economic factors. Policies and services should consider a response to widening inequalities in harmful consumption.","Reynolds, Ciara M E; Purdy, Joanna; Rodriguez, Lauren; McAvoy, Helen",Eur. j. public health,184,33

In addition to the burden of psychosocial stress, there is increasing evidence of direct viral neuroinvasion of the central nervous system through physical contact with the nasal mucosa. In a parallel fashion, there is a significant body of ongoing research related to the risk of in utero viral transmission and the resulting neurodevelopmental impact in the fetus. Aberrant neurodevelopment secondary to viral transmission has previously been related to the later development of psychosis, schizophrenia, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders, generating the hypothesis that this population of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 may see an increased incidence in future decades.

TBI patients suffer short- and long-term behavioral, cognitive, and emotional impairments, including difficulties in concentration, memory loss, and depression. Research shows that CE application can mitigate cognitive and behavioral impairments in animal models for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, whose pathophysiology is similar to that of TBI. This study builds on prior research by showing similar results in TBI mice models. After drinking CE for a week, mice were injured using our 70-g weight drop TBI device. For 2 weeks thereafter, the mice continued drinking CE alongside standard lab nutrition. Subsequently, the mice underwent behavioral tests to assess their memory, motor activity, and anxiety. The mice brains were harvested for immunohistochemistry staining to evaluate overall neuronal survival. Our results show that CE consumption almost completely mitigates memory impairment and decreases neuronal loss after TBI. Mice that did not consume CE demonstrated impaired memory. Our results also show that CE consumption attenuated neuronal loss in the temporal cortex and the dentate gyrus. Mice that did not consume CE suffered a significant neuronal loss. There were no significant differences in anxiety levels and motor activity between all groups. These findings show a new therapeutic approach to improve cognitive function and decrease memory loss after TBI.","Qubty, Doaa; Rubovitch, Vardit; Benromano, Tali; Ovadia, Michael; Pick, Chaim G",J. mol. neurosci,184,18

Despite the genetic mutations across the SARS-CoV-2 genome being recently investigated, its transcriptomic genetic polymorphisms at inter-host level and the viral gene expression level based on each Open Reading Frame (ORF) remains unclear. Using available High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data and based on SARS-CoV-2 infected human transcriptomic data, this study presents a high-resolution map of SARS-CoV-2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) hotspots in a viral population at inter-host level. Four throat swab samples from COVID-19 infected patients were pooled, with RNA-Seq read retrieved from SRA NCBI to detect 21 SNPs and a replacement across the SARS-CoV-2 genomic population. Twenty-two RNA modification sites on viral transcripts were identified that may cause inter-host genetic diversity of this virus. In addition, the canonical genomic RNAs of N ORF showed higher expression in transcriptomic data and reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR compared to other SARS-CoV-2 ORFs, indicating the importance of this ORF in virus replication or other major functions in virus cycle. Phylogenetic and ancestral sequence analyses based on the entire genome revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is possibly derived from a recombination event between SARS-CoV and Bat SARS-like CoV. Ancestor analysis of the isolates from different locations including Iran suggest shared Chinese ancestry. These results propose the importance of potential inter-host level genetic variations to the evolution of SARS-COV-2, and the formation of viral quasi-species. The RNA modifications discovered in this study may cause amino acid sequence changes in polyprotein, spike protein, product of ORF8 and nucleocapsid (N) protein, suggesting further insights to understanding the functional impacts of mutations in the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.","Ghorbani, Abozar; Samarfard, Samira; Ramezani, Amin; Izadpanah, Keramatollah; Afsharifar, Alireza; Eskandari, Mohammad Hadi; Karbanowicz, Thomas P; Peters, Jonathan R",Infect Genet Evol,184,1

This study investigated the trends in anxiety and performance of preventive measures among Taiwanese citizens during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This study employed an anonymous online survey to investigate anxiety and preventive behavior practice in adults during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 6-item state version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6) was used to measure symptoms of anxiety. The preventive measures consisted of 12 items divided into three categories: Personal protection, cough etiquette, and social distance and voluntary quarantine. The three time periods studied were the lockdown in Wuhan, China (from January 23 to February 7), the week when enhanced border protections and in-person mask purchase systems were introduced and the first citizen tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms (from February 8 to February 16), and the 10 days following the first death from COVID-19 in Taiwan (from February 27 to March 9). The Cochran-Armitage trend test and the Jonckheere trend test were used to analyze changes in the degree of anxiety and the adoption of preventive measures in the early stages of the epidemic. An analysis of covariance was performed to examine the relationship between changes in anxiety and engagement in preventive behaviors after control for sex, age, education, and income. Results: The percentages of the participants with moderate to high levels of anxiety during the three time periods were 45%, 50%, and 55%, respectively. The percentages of those who practiced preventive measures often or always during the three time periods were 46%, 58%, and 66%, respectively. Significant increases were found both in levels of anxiety and in performance of preventive measures over the three time periods, but no differences across sex, age, education, or income groups were found. Changes in anxiety and performance of preventive behaviors were significantly associated during the three periods.

The implied life savings exceed 9,400 people over a period of less than a month. We also find that business closures exhibited rapidly diminishing returns and had large effects outside the closed businesses themselves, including spillovers to other municipalities.

Significant progress has been made in advancing our understanding of the disease process, one of the unanswered questions, however, is the anomaly in the case/mortality ratio with Mexico as a clear example. Herein, this anomaly is explored by spatial analysis and whether mortality varies locally according to local factors. To address this, hexagonal cartogram maps (hexbin) used to spatially map COVID-19 mortality and visualise association with patient-level data on demographics and pre-existing health conditions. This was further interrogated at local Mexico City level by choropleth mapping. Our data show that the use of hexagonal cartograms is a better approach for spatial mapping of COVID-19 data in Mexico as it addresses bias in area size and population. We report sex/age-related spatial relationship with mortality amongst the Mexican states and a trend between health conditions and mortality at the state level. Within Mexico City, there is a clear south, north divide with higher mortality in the northern municipalities. Deceased patients in these northern municipalities have the highest pre-existing health conditions. Taken together, this study provides an improved presentation of COVID-19 mapping in Mexico and demonstrates spatial divergence of the mortality in Mexico.","Javaheri, Behzad",,184,1

However, there is no study on the acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine in Japan. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy situation in Japan and assess the factors associated with such issues. This was a cross-sectional study based on an internet survey completed by 2956 people. Participants were asked to indicate how likely they were to get vaccinated for COVID-19. In addition, the participants responded to questions regarding sociodemographic factors, attitudes, and beliefs regarding COVID-19 infection and vaccination. The proportion of participants with a high likelihood of getting a COVID-19 vaccine was 62.1%. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that vaccine acceptance was lower among several sociodemographic groups, such as women, adults aged 20-49 years, and those with a low-income level. Several psychological factors, especially the perceived effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine, and willingness to protect others by getting oneself vaccinated, were associated with vaccine acceptance. Our results indicate that the perceived effectiveness of the vaccine and willingness to protect others may play an important role in the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine.","Machida, Masaki; Nakamura, Itaru; Kojima, Takako; Saito, Reiko; Nakaya, Tomoki; Hanibuchi, Tomoya; Takamiya, Tomoko; Odagiri, Yuko; Fukushima, Noritoshi; Kikuchi, Hiroyuki; Amagasa, Shiho; Watanabe, Hidehiro; Inoue, Shigeru",,184,24

We searched the PubMed (Medline), Web of Science and Cochrane databases for articles published between 01 January 2020 and 05 August 2020 using SARS-CoV-2 and GBS-related keywords. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, antecedent symptoms, clinical, serological and electrophysiological features, and hospital outcomes were recorded. We included 45 articles from 16 countries reporting 61 patients with SARS-CoV-2-associated GBS. Most (97.7%) articles were from high- and upper-middle-income countries. Forty-two (68.9%) of the patients were male; median (interquartile range) age was 57 (49-70) years. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in 90.2% of patients. One report of SARS-CoV-2-associated familial GBS was found which affected a father and daughter of a family. Albuminocytological dissociation in cerebrospinal fluid was found in 80.8% of patients. The majority of patients (75.5%) had a demyelinating subtype of GBS. Intravenous immunoglobulin and plasmapheresis were given to 92.7% and 7.3% of patients, respectively. Around two-thirds (65.3%) of patients had a good outcome (GBS-disability score &#8804; 2) on discharge from hospital. Two patients died in hospital. SARS-CoV-2-associated GBS mostly resembles the classical presentations of GBS that respond to standard treatments.

In a convenience sample of HIV-positive Black Americans, we examined associations of COVID-19 related medical mistrust with COVID-19 vaccine and COVID-19 treatment hesitancy, and negative impacts of COVID-19 on antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. METHODS: Participants were 101 HIV-positive Black Americans (age: M=50.3 years; SD=11.5; 86% cisgender male; 77% sexual minority) enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of a community-based ART adherence intervention in Los Angeles County, CA.

These measures may have had a negative impact on perceived quality of care and symptoms in patients with chronic disorders. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether patients under long-term home noninvasive ventilation (LTHNIV) for chronic respiratory failure (CRF) were negatively affected by the 56-day confinement (March-April 2020). METHODS: A questionnaire-based survey exploring mood disturbances (HAD), symptom scores related to NIV (S3-NIV), and perception of health-care providers during confinement was sent to all patients under LTHNIV followed up by our center. Symptom scores and data obtained by ventilator software were compared between confinement and the 56 days prior to confinement. RESULTS: Of a total of 100 eligible patients, 66 were included (median age: 66 years [IQR: 53-74]): 35 (53%) with restrictive lung disorders, 20 (30%) with OHS or SRBD, and 11 (17%) with COPD or overlap syndrome. Prevalence of anxiety (n = 7; 11%) and depressive (n = 2; 3%) disorders was remarkably low. Symptom scores were slightly higher during confinement although this difference was not clinically relevant. Technical data regarding ventilation, including compliance, did not change. Patients complained of isolation and lack of social contact. They felt supported by their relatives and caregivers but complained of the lack of regular contact and information by health-care professionals. CONCLUSIONS: Patients under LTHNIV for CRF showed a remarkable resilience during the SARS-CoV-2 confinement period.

This study explores the impact of the Australian 2019/20 bushfires followed by the COVID-19 pandemic on unintentional coastal drowning fatalities. Fatality data were collated using triangulation methodology. Percentage change in coastal drowning fatalities between 2019/20 financial year (FY) and the 15FY annual average (2004/5-2018/19) were calculated for the dominant bushfire period (August 2019-February 2020 inclusive) and COVID-19 restrictions in place for 2019/20FY (March-June 2020 inclusive). Relative risk (RR; with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) of coastal drowning was calculated against the average for overall, bushfire and COVID-19 periods, using coastal participation data as the denominator, weighted for the predicted decrease in the use of outdoor coastal areas due to these widespread events. Coastal drowning fatalities increased in 2019/20FY by 9% overall (bushfires: 6%; COVID-19: 9%). Swimming/wading drowning fatalities increased during the bushfire period (RR = 2.02; 95% CI: 1.13-3.63), while boating and personal watercraft (PWC)-related fatalities increased during both the bushfire (RR = 2.92; 95% CI: 1.41-6.05) and COVID-19 period (RR = 3.86; 95% CI: 1.64-9.11).

This includes the spread of misinformation, which has been documented within the context of the emerging COVID-19 crisis. Understanding the creation, spread and uptake of social media misinformation is of critical importance to public safety. In this descriptive study, we detail Twitter activity regarding spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) and claims it increases, or ""boosts"", immunity. Spinal manipulation is a common intervention used by many health professions, most commonly by chiropractors. There is no clinical evidence that SMT improves human immunity. METHODS: Social media searching software (Talkwalker Quick Search) was used to describe Twitter activity regarding SMT and improving or boosting immunity. Searches were performed for the 3 months and 12 months before March 31, 2020 using terms related to 1) SMT, 2) the professions that most often provide SMT and 3) immunity. From these searches, we determined the magnitude and time course of Twitter activity then coded this activity into content that promoted or refuted a SMT/immunity link. Content themes, high-influence users and user demographics were then stratified as either promoting or refuting this linkage. RESULTS: Twitter misinformation regarding a SMT/immunity link increased dramatically during the onset of the COVID crisis. Activity levels (number of tweets) and engagement scores (likes + retweets) were roughly equal between content promoting or refuting a SMT/immunity link, however, the potential reach (audience) of tweets refuting a SMT/immunity link was 3 times higher than those promoting a link. Users with the greatest influence on Twitter, as either promoters or refuters, were individuals, not institutions or organizations. The majority of tweets promoting a SMT/immunity link were generated in the USA while the majority of refuting tweets originated from Canada. CONCLUSION: Twitter activity about SMT and immunity increased during the COVID-19 crisis. Results from this work have the potential to help policy makers and others understand the impact of SMT misinformation and devise strategies to mitigate its impact.","Kawchuk, Greg; Hartvigsen, Jan; Harsted, Steen; Nim, Casper Glissmann; Nyirö, Luana",Chiropr Man Therap,184,6

Wearing personal protective equipment, especially respirators (face masks), has become common for both the public and medical professionals, proving to be effective in preventing spread of the virus. Nevertheless, a detailed understanding of respirator filtration-layer internal structures and their physical configurations is lacking. Here, we report three-dimensional (3D) internal analysis of N95 filtration layers via X-ray tomography. Using deep learning methods, we uncover how the distribution and diameters of fibers within these layers directly affect contaminant particle filtration. The average porosity of the filter layers is found to be 89.1%. Contaminants are more efficiently captured by denser fiber regions, with fibers <1.8 µm in diameter being particularly effective, presumably because of the stronger electric field gradient on smaller diameter fibers. This study provides critical information for further development of N95-type respirators that combine high efficiency with good breathability.","Lee, Hye Ryoung; Liao, Lei; Xiao, Wang; Vailionis, Arturas; Ricco, Antonio J; White, Robin; Nishi, Yoshio; Chiu, Wah; Chu, Steven; Cui, Yi",Nano lett,184,16

OBJECTIVE: Complement hyperactivation promotes lung injury and was observed in patients suffering from Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, we investigated the very first interactions of primary human airway epithelial cells on exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of complement component 3 (C3)-mediated effects. METHODS: For this, we used highly differentiated primary human 3-dimensional tissue models infected with SARS-CoV-2 patient isolates. On infection, viral load, viral infectivity, intracellular complement activation, inflammatory mechanisms, and tissue destruction were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, high content screening, plaque assays, luminex analyses, and transepithelial electrical resistance measurements. RESULTS: Here, we show that primary normal human bronchial and small airway epithelial cells respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection by an inflated local C3 mobilization. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in exaggerated intracellular complement activation and destruction of the epithelial integrity in monolayer cultures of primary human airway cells and highly differentiated, pseudostratified, mucus-producing, ciliated respiratory tissue models. SARS-CoV-2-infected 3-dimensional cultures secreted significantly higher levels of C3a and the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, IL-1&#945;, and RANTES. CONCLUSIONS: Crucially, we illustrate here for the first time that targeting the anaphylotoxin receptors C3a receptor and C5a receptor in nonimmune respiratory cells can prevent intrinsic lung inflammation and tissue damage. This opens up the exciting possibility in the treatment of COVID-19.","Posch, Wilfried; Vosper, Jonathan; Noureen, Asma; Zaderer, Viktoria; Witting, Christina; Bertacchi, Giulia; Gstir, Ronald; Filipek, Przemyslaw A; Bonn, Günther K; Huber, Lukas A; Bellmann-Weiler, Rosa; Lass-Flörl, Cornelia; Wilflingseder, Doris",J. allergy clin. immunol,184,16

For this purpose, ten exercises were developed to be downloaded by the students and the solutions returned to the course lecturer on a weekly basis. In addition, two students individually recorded via video one of eight doctor-patient exercise conversations, which were then evaluated by four other students and the respective lecturer. Methods: For evaluation, the students filled out an exercise and an effect-related questionnaire with 21 items. Results: The questionnaire was completed by n=203 (98%) students (59% female, 41% male). The video-based situation analyses (91%) helped most of them to become rather closely or very well acquainted with medical conversation practice. 76% rated the exercise ""Enlightenment Conversation/SPIKES Protocol"" as fairly helpful or very helpful in respect to the practicing concepts of medical conversation. When asked about the effects, most of them found the idea of patient orientation in medicine to be quite helpful or very helpful (83%). About a quarter of them (24%) stated that the online course could not, or only slightly, replace face-to-face teaching. This assessment was less pronounced among female students than among male students (Wilcoxon test p<.01). Conclusion: Our online course concept of physician-patient conversation found good overall response among pre-clinical medical students. However, the participants expressed different opinions about the extent to which the concept can replace face-to-face teaching.","Fischbeck, Sabine; Hardt, Jochen; Malkewitz, Camila; Petrowski, Katja",GMS J Med Educ,184,1

About 3.2% of patients with COVID-19 will require intubation and invasive ventilation. Moreover, there will be an increase in the number of critically ill patients, hospitalized and intubated due to unrelated acute pathology, who will present underlying asymptomatic or mild forms of COVID-19. Tracheostomy is one of the procedures associated with an increased production of aerosols and higher risk of transmission of the virus to the health personnel. The aim of this paper is to describe indications and recommended technique of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients, emphasizing the safety of the patient but also the medical team involved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidisciplinary group made up of surgeons with privileges to perform tracheostomies, intensive care physicians, infectious diseases specialists and intensive pulmonologists was created to update previous knowledge on performing a tracheostomy in critically ill adult patients (>18 years) amidst the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a high-volume referral center. Published evidence was collected using a systematic search and review of published studies. RESULTS: A guideline comprising indications, surgical technique, ventilator settings, personal protective equipment and timing of tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients was developed. CONCLUSIONS: A safe approach to performing percutaneous dilational bedside tracheostomy with bronchoscopic guidance is feasible in COVID-19 patients of appropriate security measures are taken and a strict protocol is followed.

No vaccine has yet been developed for COVID-19. The compliance of the general public with the advice and regulations of the health authorities and the adoption of effective health behavior regimens are currently the only weapons to effectively cope with the disease. Here we report the results of a worldwide survey (n = 953) conducted between March 2 and March 14, 2020 that sought (a) to identify critical proximal predictors of health behavior relevant to the current situation, (b) to examine their relationships to various demographic characteristics of the population, (c) and to provide a model of health behavior specific to COVID-19. We found that the perceived severity of the disease and susceptibility to it, emotional reactions, and attitudes toward COVID-19 predicted one-third of the preventive behavior variance. Various demographic variables influenced these predictors. Based on the data collected, we constructed, using path analysis, a theoretical model of health behavior. Our results emphasize the need to consider the impact of antecedent variables on actual precautionary behavior and the influence of demographic factors on these antecedent variables. Understanding the complex interplay of these precursors in health behavior will maximize their beneficial role, eliminate maladaptive prevention patterns, and facilitate the eradication of the disease.","Anaki, David; Sergay, Jamie",PLoS One,184,1

The Mario Pinotti II (MPII) study is a 24-week observational study that conducted scheduled telephone calls every 2 weeks to verify the occurrence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatic diseases on chronic hydroxychloroquine therapy (from March 29, 2020, to September 30, 2020). The effects of voluntarily participating in a research project (ie, one that involves interactions via telephone contact with patients, professors, rheumatologists, and colleagues) on the daily lives and mental health of medical students requires evaluation. Objective: As medical students are professionals in training and have a high level of responsibility in terms of handling the emotional and physical aspects of several diseases, this study aims to evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and participation in the MPII study on the educational routines and mental health of medical students. Methods: A web-based survey was carried out to perform a cross-sectional comparative assessment of medical students who participated in the MPII study and their colleagues who were not involved in the MPII study. Participants from both groups were matched based on sex, age, and medical school. The web questionnaire was developed by a panel composed of graduate medical students, rheumatologists, medical school professors, and a psychology professor. The questionnaire included details on demographic and life habits data and evaluated participants' impressions of the MPII study and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their educational routines and medical training. In addition, depression, anxiety, and stress were evaluated using the Brazilian version of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS)-21, and currently, the DASS-21 scores are grouped as those that indicate a low, moderate, or high risk of mental distress. This project was approved by the Federal University of São Paulo Ethics Committee (CAAE: 34034620.0.0000.5505). Results: Data were collected from both medical student groups from July 20 to August 31, 2020. Data extraction was completed in September 2020. The data analysis is ongoing. We expect the results to be published in the first semester of 2021. Conclusions: This study will provide insight into the effects of participating in a research project on depression, anxiety, and stress, which will be determined by applying the DASS-21 to a large sample of Brazilian undergraduate medical students.

With pressures to reduce the number of in-person ambulatory visits, innovative models of telemonitoring have been used during the pandemic as a necessary alternative to support access to care for patients with chronic conditions. The pandemic has led health care organizations to consider the adoption of telemonitoring interventions for the first time, while others have seen existing programs rapidly expand. OBJECTIVE: At the Toronto General Hospital in Ontario, Canada, the rapid expansion of a telemonitoring program began on March 9, 2020, in response to COVID-19. The objective of this study was to understand the experiences related to the expanded role of a telemonitoring program under the changing conditions of the pandemic. METHODS: A single-case qualitative study was conducted with 3 embedded units of analysis. Semistructured interviews probed the experiences of patients, clinicians, and program staff from the Medly telemonitoring program at a heart function clinic in Toronto, Canada. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis as well as Eakin and Gladstone's value-adding approach to enhance the analytic interpretation of the study findings. RESULTS: A total of 29 participants were interviewed, including patients (n=16), clinicians (n=9), and operational staff (n=4). Four themes were identified: (1) providing care continuity through telemonitoring; (2) adapting telemonitoring operations for a more virtual health care system; (3) confronting virtual workflow challenges; and (4) fostering a meaningful patient-provider relationship. Beyond supporting virtual visits, the program's ability to provide a more comprehensive picture of the patient's health was valued. However, issues relating to the lack of system integration and alert-driven interactions jeopardized the perceived sustainability of the program. CONCLUSIONS: With the reduction of in-person visits during the pandemic, virtual services such as telemonitoring have demonstrated significant value. Based on our study findings, we offer recommendations to proactively adapt and scale telemonitoring programs under the changing conditions of an increasingly virtual health care system. These include revisiting the scope and expectations of telemedicine interventions, streamlining virtual patient onboarding processes, and personalizing the collection of patient information to build a stronger virtual relationship and a more holistic assessment of patient well-being.","Wali, Sahr; Guessi Margarido, Milena; Shah, Amika; Ware, Patrick; McDonald, Michael; O039,; Sullivan, Mary; Duero Posada, Juan; Ross, Heather; Seto, Emily",J Med Internet Res,184,16

In this prospective cohort study, 45 adults (19 chronic, 26 acute/subacute TMD) were recruited prior to the COVID-19 outbreak. Baseline assessment took place before the outbreak while a follow-up was performed immediately after the lockdown period. Multiple variables were investigated including age, gender, perceived life quality, sleep quality, anxiety and depression, coping strategies, central sensitization, pain intensity, pain-related disability and oral behaviour. COVID Stress Scales (CSS) were applied at follow-up to measure the extent of COVID-related distress. CSS were significantly higher in those with chronic TMDs compared to those with acute/subacute TMDs (p<0.05). In people with chronic TMD, the variation in anxiety and depression from baseline to follow-up was significantly correlated with scores on the CSS (r = 0.72; p = 0.002). Variations of the central sensitization inventory (r = 0.57; p = 0.020) and graded chronic pain scale (r = 0.59; p = 0.017) were significantly correlated with scores on the CSS. These initial findings indicate that people with chronic TMD were more susceptible to COVID-19 distress with deterioration of psychological status, worsening features of central sensitization and increased chronic facial pain severity. These findings reinforce the role of stress as a possible amplifier of central sensitization, anxiety, depression, chronic pain and pain-related disability in people with TMDs.

Patients from sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) are underrepresented in existing studies of sepsis, and little is known about ARDS in sSA. Severe respiratory distress (SRD) is a surrogate for ARDS defined by the WHO as O2 saturation &lt;90% or respiratory rate &gt;30 breaths/minute and a systolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg plus suspected infection in the absence of cardiac failure. In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, a better understanding of SRD in sSA is urgently needed. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and in-hospital mortality of adults with SRD in sSA. Methods We analyzed pooled individual-level data from 16 studies of hospitalized patients conducted in 6 countries throughout sSA from 2009 to 2019. We used multiple imputation with chained equations with 10 iterations to impute missing data. We performed multivariable logistic regression to estimate associations between patient vital signs, laboratory studies, SRD, and in-hospital mortality. We characterized factors associated with in-hospital mortality in the subset of patients with SRD. Results The pooled data included 7385 patients with a median age of 37 years, of whom 3584 (49%) were women, 2282 (31%) were living with HIV, 3190 (43%) had a known acute infection, and 946 (13%) had SRD. The mortality for the total population and for patients with SRD was 15% and 22%, respectively. Older age, lower temperature, increased heart rate, increased respiratory rate, decreased oxygen saturation, Glasgow Coma Scale score &lt;15, HIV infection, and SRD were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. For every increase of 5 breaths/minute, there was a 72% increase in the odds of in-hospital mortality, and conversely for every 1% increase in O2 saturation there was a 5% reduction in the odds of in-hospital mortality. In a subset of patients with available laboratory values, decreased hemoglobin and increased lactate were independently associated with increased inhospital mortality. We found similar associations with in-hospital mortality in the subset of patients with SRD. Conclusions In the first comprehensive evaluation of the prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalized patients from sSA with WHO-defined SRD, we found that the prevalence of SRD was high and independently associated with in-hospital mortality. These findings can serve as a benchmark for future studies of patients with SRD in sSA including those with COVID-19.","Chang, B.; Adakun, S.; Andrews, B.; Auma, M.; Banura, P.; Crump, J.; Grobusch, M.; Huson, M.; Jacob, S.; Jarrett, O.; Kallett, J.; Majwala, A.; Mbonde, A.; Rubach, M.; Rylance, J.; Schieffelin, J.; Ssekitoleko, R.; Wheeler, I.; Rogawski-McQuade, E.; Moore, C.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,184,26

DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey of parents of primary and secondary school-age children. SETTING: Community setting. PARTICIPANTS: 1214 parents of school-age children in the UK. METHODS: An online survey explored the impact of lockdown on the mental health of parents with school-age children, and in particular about feelings of social isolation and loneliness. Associations between the UCLA Three-Item Loneliness Scale (UCLATILS), the Direct Measure of Loneliness (DMOL) and the characteristics of the study participants were assessed using ordinal logistic regression models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported measures of social isolation and loneliness using UCLATILS and DMOL. RESULTS: Half of respondents felt they lacked companionship, 45% had feelings of being left out, 58% felt isolated and 46% felt lonely during the first 100 days of lockdown. The factors that were associated with higher levels of loneliness on UCLATILS were female gender, parenting a child with special needs, lack of a dedicated space for distance learning, disruption of sleep patterns and low levels of physical activity during the lockdown. Factors associated with a higher DMOL were female gender, single parenting, parenting a child with special needs, unemployment, low physical activity, lack of a dedicated study space and disruption of sleep patterns during the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown has increased feelings of social isolation and loneliness among parents of school-age children. The sustained adoption of two modifiable health-seeking lifestyle behaviours (increased levels of physical activity and the maintenance of good sleep hygiene practices) wmay help reduce feelings of social isolation and loneliness during lockdown.","El-Osta, Austen; Alaa, Aos; Webber, Iman; Riboli Sasco, Eva; Bagkeris, Emmanouil; Millar, Helen; Vidal-Hall, Charlotte; Majeed, Azeem",BMJ Open,184,2

Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the association between environmental factors and the number of COVID-19 death cases under different aggregation strategies to illustrate the presence of MAUP. We used real-world COVID-19 outbreak data from the Hubei and Henan Provinces and studied their association with atmospheric NO2 levels. By fitting linear regression models with penalized splines on NO2, we found that the association between COVID-19 mortality and NO2 varies when data were aggregated (1) at the city level, (2) under two different aggregation strategies, and (3) at the provincial level, indicating the presence of MAUP.

In Uganda, teenage pregnancy is a public and community health issue. Objectives: This study hypothesized that there would be regional variations in rates, risk factors and trends of teenage pregnancy in Uganda. Methods: Data were analyzed from the Uganda Demographic and Health Surveys (UDHS) in 2006 and 2011. The outcome of interest was current pregnancy for females 15 to 19 years of age at the time of the survey. Bivariate analysis was performed for each year to examine the rate and trends of pregnancy by various demographic characteristics. Logistic regression was conducted to assess the association between teenage pregnancy and sociodemographic variables. Results: Uganda's rate of teenage pregnancy increased from 7.3/1000 in 2006 to 8.1/1000 in 2011. The East Central region consistently had the highest rates than other regions. In 2006, teenage pregnancy was significantly associated with being married, living with a partner or separated, as compared to those who were single. Marital and wealth status were also significant predictors of teenage pregnancy based on the 2011 survey. Conclusion: The rate of teenage pregnancy in Uganda is high and the trend demonstrated regional variation.

The present study aimed to identify the predictors of turnover intention based on psychosocial factors in nurses of Ardabil pre-hospital emergency and educational and medical centres during the COVID-19 outbreak. DESIGN: The present descriptive-analytical study was conducted in June, 2020. METHODS: A total of 479 nurses working in Ardabil pre-hospital emergency and educational and medical centres to fight COVID-19 were recruited for this study using the census method. Data were collected using the Demographic Information Questionnaire, Turnover Intention Questionnaire, Weiss & Marmar Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), General Health Questionnaire (12 C-GHQ) and Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ). Data were analysed with SPSSv.22 software using correlation, t test, analysis of variance, multiple regression and descriptive tests. RESULTS: The mean turnover intention score of nurses was 41.73 with a standard deviation of 12.11. The results of correlation coefficient revealed a positive relationship between PTSD, general health, job demand and job strain with turnover intention (p &#8804; .01) and a positive and significant relationship between social support and turnover intention (p &#8804; .01). Multiple regression analysis showed that the variables of gender, marital status, work position, decision latitude, social support, job strain, general health and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were predictors of turnover intention. CONCLUSION: Job stressors during the COVID-19 outbreak have led to an increase in nurses' turnover intention.

The new coronavirus is rapidly spreading all over the world and considered a pandemic. The first case in Turkey was confirmed on March 10, 2020, and on March 18, 2020, Turkey has reached the 100thcase. Material and Methods: In this study, the doubling times of the outbreak in the European Union countries, especially Turkey, were investigated. Moreover, in this context, as South Korea has been extensively testing both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and implementing effective strategies, the doubling times have increased steadily linearly without any decline. Therefore, the doubling times for European countries have been compared to South Korea. Results: The highest slope in doubling times was achieved in South Korea and Austria. Among the compared countries, Italy, despite its 51stday after its 100thcase, has not yet experienced a rapid rise. In Turkey, the doubling time after the 100thcase was calculated to be 1.04. Initially, Turkey was ranked as the country with the lowest doubling times between European Union countries, however, at the point reached today (the 34thday after than the 100thcase); after Spain, Austria, Switzerland, and South Korea, Turkey ranks fourth by a doubling time of 13.14. Conclusion: Turkey on the 34thday after the 100thcase of the outbreak, has made further successful progress more than major European countries. The prolongation of the doubling time in this wise is promising to combat the pandemic successfully.","Ahmadian, Robab; Uncu, Yeşim; Ercan, İlker",Turk. Klinikleri J. Med. Sci.,184,30

An outbreak of this disease has been reported in mainland China with the city of Wuhan as the recognized epicenter. The disease has also been exported to other countries, including the Philippines, but the level of spread is still under control (as of 08 February 2020). To describe and predict the dynamics of the disease, several preliminary mathematical models are formulated by various international study groups. Here, the insights that can be drawn from these models are discussed, especially as inputs for designing strategies to control the epidemics. Proposed model-based strategies on how to prevent the spread of the disease in local setting, such as during large social gatherings, are also presented. The model shows that the exposure time is a significant factor in spreading the disease. With a basic reproduction number equal to 2, and 14-day infectious period, an infected person staying more than 9 hours in the event could infect other people. Assuming the exposure time is 18 hours, the model recommends that attendees of the social gathering should have a protection with more than 70 percent effectiveness.","Rabajante, Jomar F.",,184,16

Results show that Bitcoin has a causal nexus with Chinese yuan and Indian rupee for price and various return components. The MRSR analysis justifies these findings by demonstrating the presence of interaction in contractionary regimes. Accordingly, it can be stated that when markets display a downward trend, appreciation of the Chinese yuan and Indian rupee positively and strongly affects the value of Bitcoin, possibly due to the market timing. The MRSR analysis also exhibits a transition from a tranquil to a crisis regime in March 2020 because of the pandemic. However, a shorter duration spent in the crisis regime in 2020 indicates the limited and relatively less harmful effect of the pandemic on the cryptocurrency market when compared to the turmoil that occurred in 2018.","Samet, Gunay Kaskaloglu Kerem Shahnawaz Muhammed",Mathematics,184,26

Preventing in-hospital transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is challenging, since symptom-based screening protocols may miss asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients. In particular, dental healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of exposure, as face-to-face contact and exposure to oral secretions is unavoidable. We report exposure of HCWs during dental procedures on a mild symptomatic COVID-19 patient. A 32-year-old male visited a dental clinic at a tertiary care hospital. He experienced mild cough, which started three days before the dental visit, but did not report his symptom during the entrance screening. He underwent several dental procedures and imaging for orthognathic surgery without wearing a mask. Seven HCWs were closely exposed to the patient during dental procedures that could have generated droplets and aerosols. One HCW had close contact with the patient during radiologic exams, and seven HCWs had casual contact. All HCWs wore particulate filtering respirators with 94% filter capacity and gloves, but none wore eye protection or gowns. The next day, the patient experienced dysgeusia and was diagnosed with COVID-19 with high viral load. All HCWs who had close contact with the patient were quarantined for 14 days, and polymerase chain reaction and antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 were negative. This exposure event suggests the protective effect of particulate filtering respirators in dental clinics. The recommendations of different levels of personal protective equipment (PPE) for dental HCWs according to the procedure types should be established according to the planned procedure, the risk of COVID-19 infection of the patient, and the outbreak situation of the community.","Kim, Dosup; Ko, Jae-Hoon; Peck, Kyong Ran; Baek, Jin Yang; Moon, Hee-Won; Ki, Hyun Kyun; Yoon, Ji Hyun; Kim, Hyo Jin; Choi, Jeong Hwa; Park, Ga Eun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),184,19

However, systematic assessment of inflammatory response-related factors associated with SMI that could influence COVID-19 outcomes is lacking. In the present review, dietary patterns, smoking and the use of psychotropic medications are discussed as potential extrinsic risk factors and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) gene polymorphisms are considered as potential intrinsic risk factors. A genetics-based prediction model for SMI using ACE-I/D genotyping is also proposed for use in patients experiencing severe COVID-19. Furthermore, the literature suggests that ACE inhibitors may have protective effects against SMI or severe COVID-19, which is often linked to hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities. For this reason, we hypothesize that using these medications to treat patients with severe COVID-19 might yield improved outcomes, including in the context of SMI associated with COVID-19.

However, the pathophysiological mechanisms connecting these GI symptoms to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections remain elusive. Previous studies indicate that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into intestinal cells leads to downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors resulting in impaired barrier function. While intestinal ACE2 functions as a chaperone for the amino acid transporter B0AT1, the B0AT1/ACE2 complex within the intestinal epithelium acts as a regulator of gut microbiota composition and function. Alternations to the B0AT1/ACE2 complex lead to microbial dysbiosis through increased local and systemic immune responses. Previous studies have also suggested that altered serotonin metabolism may be the underlying cause of GI disorders involving diarrhea. The findings of elevated plasma serotonin levels and high fecal calprotectin in COVID-19 patients with diarrhea indicate that the viral infection evokes a systemic inflammatory response that specifically involves the GI. Interestingly, the elevated proinflammatory cytokines correlate with elevated serotonin and fecal calprotectin levels further supporting the evidence of GI inflammation, a hallmark of functional GI disorders. Moreover, the finding that rectal swabs of COVID-19 patients remain positive for SARS-CoV-2 even after the nasopharynx clears the virus, suggests that viral replication and shedding from the GI tract may be more robust than that of the respiratory tract, further indicating fecal-oral transmission as another important route of viral spread. This review summarized the evidence for pathophysiological mechanisms (impaired barrier function, gut inflammation, altered serotonin metabolism and gut microbiota dysbiosis) underlying the GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19.","Jin, Byungchang; Singh, Rajan; Ha, Se Eun; Zogg, Hannah; Park, Paul J; Ro, Seungil",World J Gastroenterol,184,26

The data set consists of MCF7 which is a human breast cancer cell line with estrogen, progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors. The cell lines treated with different quantities of Cissampelos pareira (Cipa). Cipa is a traditional medicinal plant which would possess an antiviral potency in preventing viral diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Methods: Utilizing Biobase, GEOquery, gplots packages in R studio, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. The gene ontology (GO) of pathway enrichments employed by utilizing DAVID and KEGG enrichment analyses were studied. We further constructed a human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and performed, based upon that, a subnetwork module analysis for significant signaling pathways. Results: The study identified 418 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using bioinformatics tools.

The results clearly indicated that ABA improves TAA-induced hepatic injury and collagen accumulation in mice. Otherwise, ABA significantly reduced liver fibrosis by regulating caspase-3 and Bcl-2, &#945;-smooth muscle actin, and collagen I. ABA inhibited the nuclear factor kappa B pathway, significantly alleviating oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines.

The adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 until August 20, 2020 was estimated as 14.2% (95% uncertainty interval: 13.3%, 15.2%), which was equal to 11,958,346 (95% confidence interval: 11,211,011-12,746,776) individuals. The adjusted prevalence of infection was 14.6%, 13.8%, 16.6%, 11.7%, and 19.4% among men, women, urban population, rural population, and individuals &#8804; 60 years of age, respectively. Ardabil, Golestan, and Khuzestan provinces had the highest prevalence, and Alborz, Hormozgan, and Kerman provinces had the lowest. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the study results, a large proportion of the Iranian population had not yet been infected by COVID-19. The observance of hygienic principles and social restrictions should therefore continue until the majority of the population has been vaccinated.","Khalagi, Kazem; Gharibzadeh, Safoora; Khalili, Davood; Mansournia, Mohammad Ali; Samiee, Siamak Mirab; Aghamohamadi, Saeide; Mir-Mohammad-Ali Roodaki, Maryam; Hashemi, Seyed Mahmoud; Tayeri, Katayoun; Tabar, Hengameh Namdari; Azadmanesh, Kayhan; Tabrizi, Jafar Sadegh; Mohammad, Kazem; Hajipour, Firoozeh; Namaki, Saeid; Raeisi, Alireza; Ostovar, Afshin",Clin. microbiol. infect,184,1

The pigment release is believed to occur from retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in the former and the posterior iris in the latter. The exact timing of this pre-retinal pigment deposition is unknown but typically is mild and occurs over several months. A rapid progression of diffuse preretinal pigmentation is uncommon and may be suggestive of persistent RPE release from an open break or continued iris trauma with posterior pigment release. This report describes a case of profound posterior pigment deposition more than 4 months after retinectomy and oil in a patient with a persistently open retinectomy edge with anterior retinal detachment. The rapidity of pigment deposition was the clue to recognizing this subtle anterior detachment under silicone oil.

METHODS: An optical mark recognition/optical character recognition (OMR/OCR) system was developed to identify fields that were selected on 2,814 paper assessment forms, each with 141 fields which were used to assess potential COVID-19 infections. A novel user interface (UI) displayed mirrored forms showing the scanned assessment forms with OMR results superimposed on the left and an editable web form on the right to improve ease of data validation. Crowdsourced participants validated the results of the OMR system. Overall error rate and time taken to validate were calculated. A subset of forms was validated by multiple participants to calculate agreement between participants. RESULTS: The OMR/OCR tools correctly extracted data from scanned forms fields with an average accuracy of 70% and median accuracy of 78% when the OMR/OCR results were compared with the results from crowd validation. Scanned forms were crowd-validated at a mean rate of 157 seconds per document and a volume of approximately 108 documents per day. A randomly selected subset of documents was reviewed by multiple participants, producing an interobserver agreement of 97% for documents when narrative-text fields were included and 98% when only Boolean and multiple-choice fields were considered. CONCLUSION: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be challenging for health care workers wearing personal protective equipment to interact with electronic health records. The combination of OMR/OCR technology, a novel UI, and crowdsourcing data-validation processes allowed for the efficient extraction of a large volume of paper medical documents produced during the COVID-19 pandemic.","White-Dzuro, Colin G; Schultz, Jacob D; Ye, Cheng; Coco, Joseph R; Myers, Janet M; Shackelford, Claude; Rosenbloom, S Trent; Fabbri, Daniel",Appl Clin Inform,184,22

The subsequent efficient human-to-human transmission of this virus eventually affected millions of people worldwide. The most devastating thing is that the infection rate is continuously uprising and resulting in significant mortality especially among the older age population and those with health co-morbidities. This enveloped, positive-sense RNA virus is chiefly responsible for the infection of the upper respiratory system. The virulence of the SARS-CoV-2 is mostly regulated by its proteins like entry to the host cell through fusion mechanism, fusion of infected cells with neighboring uninfected cells to spread the virus, inhibition of host gene expression, cellular differentiation, apoptosis, mitochondrial biogenesis, etc. But very little is known about the protein structures and functionalities. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to learn more about these proteins through bioinformatics approaches. In this study, ORF10, ORF7b, ORF7a, ORF6, membrane glycoprotein, and envelope protein have been selected from a Bangladeshi Corona-virus strain G039392 and a number of bioinformatics tools (MEGA-X-V10.1.7, PONDR(R), ProtScale, ProtParam, SCRIBER, NetSurfP v2.0, IntFOLD, UCSF Chimera, and PyMol) and strategies were implemented for multiple sequence alignment and phylogeny analysis with 9 different variants, predicting hydropathicity, amino acid compositions, protein-binding propensity, protein disorders, 2D and 3D protein modeling. Selected proteins were characterized as highly flexible, structurally and electrostatically extremely stable, ordered, biologically active, hydrophobic, and closely related to the proteins of different variants. This detailed information regarding the characterization and structure of proteins of SARS-CoV-2 Bangladeshi variant was performed for the first time ever to unveil the deep mechanism behind the virulence features and also, this robust appraisal paves the future way for molecular docking, vaccine development targeting these characterized proteins.","Debnath, Pinky; Khan, Umama; Khan, Md.

Ophthalmologists are essential health care workers who provide urgent and emergent vision care services during outbreaks and address the ocular consequences of epidemic and pandemic infectious diseases. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified high priority pathogens likely to cause a future epidemic with the goal of guiding research and development to improve diagnostic tests, vaccines, and medicines. These measures were necessary to better inform and respond to public health emergencies. Given the ocular complications associated with emerging infectious diseases, there is a need to recognize the ophthalmic sequelae for future vision health preparedness for potential future outbreaks. The WHO High Priority pathogens list provides a roadmap for ophthalmologists and subspecialty providers that will guide strategic areas of research for clinical care and preparedness for future pandemic threats. This review summarizes these key viral pathogens, summarizes major systemic disease findings, and delineates relevant ocular complications of the WHO High Priority pathogens list, including Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Filovirus diseases (Ebola virus disease and Marburg hemorrhagic fever), human Coronaviruses, Lassa Fever, Nipah virus infection, Zika, and Rift Valley fever.","Kuthyar, S.; Anthony, C.

Out of a total of 648 articles found, 10 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The included studies differ for duration, setting and type of intervention, frequency of active game sessions, and outcomes considered. Seven out of ten studies reported better outcomes in children/adolescents involved in the interventions, with significant differences between groups in four, while three studies found better outcomes in control groups. These results suggest a possible positive effect of active video games on weight-related outcomes in obese children and adolescents. However, further research is still needed to define if they can be effectively used in childhood obesity treatment and which may be the most effective approach.

I argue that over 36 million people in Pakistan are standing at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, developing severe complications, and losing their lives. These two diseases, but several other socio-cultural, economic, and political factors contributing to structured vulnerabilities, would function as confounders. To deal with the critical effects of these syndemics the government needs appropriate policies and their implementation during the pandemic and post-pandemic.

One of these concerns is a surge of misinformation, which we argue should be viewed as a risk in its own right, and to which insights from decades of risk communication research must be applied. Further, when the subject of misinformation is itself a risk, as in the case of COVID-19, we argue for the utility of viewing the problem as a multi-layered risk communication problem. In such circumstances, misinformation functions as a meta-risk that interacts with and complicates publics’ perceptions of the original risk. Therefore, as the COVID-19 “misinfodemic” intensifies, risk communication research should inform the efforts of key risk communicators. To this end, we discuss the implications of risk research for efforts to fact-check COVID-19 misinformation and offer practical recommendations.","Krause, Nicole M.; Freiling, Isabelle; Beets, Becca; Brossard, Dominique",J.

Although various molecular diagnostic methods based on nucleic acid amplification have been suggested as gold standards for identifying different species, these methods are not suitable for the rapid diagnosis of pathogens owing to their long result acquisition times and complexity. In this study, we developed a rapid bio-optical sensor that uses a ball-lensed optical fiber (BLOF) probe and an automatic analysis platform to precisely diagnose infectious pathogens. The BLOF probe is easy to align and has a high optical sensing sensitivity (1.5-fold) and a large detection range (1.2-fold) for an automatic optical sensing system. Automatic signal processing of up to 250 copies/reaction of DNA of Q-fever-causing Coxiella burnetii was achieved within 8 min. The clinical utility of this system was demonstrated with 18 clinical specimens (9 Q-fever and 9 other febrile disease samples) by measuring the resonant wavelength shift of positive or negative samples for Coxiella burnetii DNA. The results from the system revealed the stable and automatic optical signal measurement of DNA with 100% accuracy. We envision that this BLOF probe-based sensor would be a practical tool for the rapid, simple, and sensitive diagnosis of emerging infectious pathogens.","Park, B.; Koo, B.; Kim, J.; Lee, K.; Bang, H.; Kim, S.

However, reported case counts are recognized to be less than the true number of cases because detection and reporting are incomplete and can vary by disease severity, geography, and over time. METHODS: To estimate the cumulative incidence SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic illnesses, and hospitalizations, we adapted a simple probabilistic multiplier model. Laboratory-confirmed case counts that were reported nationally were adjusted for sources of under-detection based on testing practices in inpatient and outpatient settings and assay sensitivity. RESULTS: We estimated that through the end of September, 1 of every 2.5 (95% Uncertainty Interval (UI): 2.0-3.1) hospitalized infections and 1 of every 7.1 (95% UI: 5.8-9.0) non-hospitalized illnesses may have been nationally reported. Applying these multipliers to reported SARS-CoV-2 cases along with data on the prevalence of asymptomatic infection from published systematic reviews, we estimate that 2.4 million hospitalizations, 44.8 million symptomatic illnesses, and 52.9 million total infections may have occurred in the U.S. population from February 27-September 30, 2020.

Sebum sampling has the potential to support both needs by looking at what the virus does to us, rather than looking for the virus itself. Methods: In this pilot study, sebum samples were collected from 67 hospitalised patients (30 COVID-19 positive and 37 COVID-19 negative) by gauze swab. Lipidomics analysis was carried out using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, identifying 998 reproducible features. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied to the resulting feature set. Findings: Lipid levels were depressed in COVID-19 positive participants, indicative of dyslipidemia; p-values of 0·022 and 0·015 were obtained for triglycerides and ceramides respectively, with effect sizes of 0·44 and 0·57. Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis showed separation of COVID-19 positive and negative participants with sensitivity of 57% and specificity of 68%, improving to 79% and 83% respectively when controlled for confounding comorbidities. Interpretation: COVID-19 dysregulates many areas of metabolism; in this work we show that the skin lipidome can be added to the list. Given that samples can be provided quickly and painlessly, we conclude that sebum is worthy of future consideration for clinical sampling.

The mathematical definition of the fractal dimension provides a way to estimate the complexity of the non-linear dynamic behavior exhibited by the time series of the countries. Fuzzy logic offers a way to represent and handle the inherent uncertainty of the classification problem. The hybrid intelligent approach is composed of a fuzzy system formed by a set of fuzzy rules that uses the fractal dimensions of the data as inputs and produce as a final output the classification of countries. The hybrid approach calculations are based on the COVID-19 data of confirmed and death cases. The main contribution is the proposed hybrid approach composed of the fractal dimension definition and fuzzy logic concepts for achieving an accurate classification of countries based on the complexity of the COVID-19 time series data. Publicly available datasets of 11 countries have been the basis to construct the fuzzy system and 15 different countries were considered in the validation of the proposed classification approach. Simulation results show that a classification accuracy over 93% can be achieved, which can be considered good for this complex problem.","Castillo, Oscar; Melin, Patricia",,184,16

We design this study to explore the value of serum procalcitonin (PCT) on predicting AKI and construct risk score for predicting AKI in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between January 30 and February 24, 2020, were included. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was performed to identify the strongest predictors of AKI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to find independent risk factors for AKI and construct risk score using odds ratio (OR) value of those risk factors. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were plotted, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) value was calculated to evaluate the predictive value of single PCT level and the constructed risk score. RESULTS: Among 389 included COVID-19 patients, 28 (7.2%) patients developed AKI. LASSO regression showed hypertension, saturation of arterial oxygen (SaO2 ), PCT, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were the strongest predictors for AKI. After multivariate logistic regression analysis, only SaO2 (<0.001), PCT (p = 0.004), and BUN (p = 0.005) were independently associated with development of AKI in COVID-19 patients. The AUC of single PCT and constructed risk score was 0. 881 and 0.928, respectively. CONCLUSION: PCT level is correlated with AKI in COVID-19 patients. The efficient risk score consisted of SaO2 , PCT, and BUN is readily accessible for physicians to evaluate the possibility of AKI in COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Ruo Ran; He, Min; Kang, Yan",J Clin Lab Anal,184,15

High standards in the design, conduct, and reporting of NHP vaccine studies are crucial for maximizing their scientific value and translation, and for making efficient use of precious resources. A key aspect is consideration of the 3Rs principles of replacement, reduction, and refinement. Funders of NHP research are placing increasing emphasis on the 3Rs, helping to ensure such studies are legitimate, ethical, and high-quality. The UK's National Centre for the 3Rs (NC3Rs) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) have collaborated on a range of initiatives to support vaccine developers to implement the 3Rs, including hosting an international workshop in 2019. The workshop identified opportunities to refine NHP vaccine studies to minimize harm and improve welfare, which can yield better quality, more reproducible data. Careful animal selection, social housing, extensive environmental enrichment, training for cooperation with husbandry and procedures, provision of supportive care, and implementation of early humane endpoints are features of contemporary good practice that should and can be adopted more widely.

Relying on a cross-fertilization between Erikson's personality theory and self-determination theory, this study aimed to examine possible sources of resilience (i.e., ego integrity and need satisfaction) and vulnerability (i.e., despair) in older adults' (mal) adjustment, thereby additionally considering the role of multiple risk and protective factors (e.g., gender and marital status). During the second month of the lockdown period in Belgium, 693 older adults (M age = 70.06, SD = 4.48, range: 65-89 years, 62.1% female) filled out online questionnaires concerning the study variables, while also completing assessments of several important sociodemographic factors. Structural equation modeling suggested that both ego integrity and despair related to indicators of well-being and psychological distress through experienced need satisfaction. Additionally, we found several factors to protect (e.g., higher perceived income) or diminish (e.g., being widowed) older adults' well-being during these challenging times, with little evidence for a moderating role of these factors in associations between the psychological variables. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.","van der Kaap-Deeder, Jolene; Vermote, Branko; Waterschoot, Joachim; Soenens, Bart; Morbée, Sofie; Vansteenkiste, Maarten",Eur J Ageing,184,0

The Australian Healthier Wealthier Families project seeks to reduce the childhood inequities caused by poverty and deprivation by creating a systematic referral pathway between two free, community-based services: universal, well-child nursing services, which provide health and development support to families with children from birth to school entry, and financial counselling. By adapting the successful Scottish 'Healthier Wealthier Children' model, the objectives of this Australian pilot are to test the (1) feasibility of systematising the referral pathway, and (2) short-term impacts on household finances, caregiver health, parenting efficacy and financial service use. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This pilot randomised controlled trial will run in three sites across two Australian states (Victoria and New South Wales), recruiting a total of 180 participants. Nurses identify eligible caregivers with a 6-item, study-designed screening survey for financial hardship. Caregivers who report one or more risk factors and consent are randomised. The intervention is financial counselling. The comparator is usual care plus information from a government money advice website. Feasibility will be evaluated using the number/proportion of caregivers who complete screening, consent and research measures, and access financial counselling. Though powered to assess feasibility, impacts will be measured 6 months post-enrolment with qualitative interviews and questionnaires about caregiver-reported income, loans and costs (adapted from national surveys, for example, the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey); health (General Health Questionnaire 1, EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale short-form); efficacy (from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children); and financial service use (study-designed) compared between arms.

Serial testing using rapid lateral flow antigen tests is a possible way to do this by screening populations in a targeted way, identifying infectious (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) people and removing them from circulation while infectious. To make rapid antigen testing effective, high levels of participation are important. This study was designed to evaluate the establishment of a testing programme in a university setting and assess some of the factors that impact participation in such a study among both staff and students. Study DesignObservational, survey MethodsA trial period of SARS-CoV-2 rapid testing using the Abbott Panbio rapid antigen test was set up and staff and students based in the University College Dublin Veterinary Hospital were asked to take part voluntarily for 6 weeks. Following the trial period, we used a questionnaire to evaluate satisfaction and to understand some reasons behind participation or lack thereof. ResultsOverall, almost all respondents to the survey stated that they were happy with having a testing programme present in the workplace and it helped to reduce anxiety associated with COVID-19. Findings indicated that staff and students did not participate equally in the voluntary testing programme. The findings also highlighted that intrinsic motivations and extrinsic motivations for participation differ. For example, participation among staff was much higher than among students, motivational messaging focused on protecting others did not resonate with students as much as staff, convenience was a key factor driving participation in both cohorts and the pressure of being forced to miss class (if positive) close to exam time provided motivation to students to avoid testing. ConclusionsIntroducing antigen testing into a workplace helped to reduce overall anxiety associated with the potential impact of COVID-19, but achieving good participation was challenging. Participation is key to a successful, campus wide antigen testing programme but reaching high levels of participation is not straightforward and can not be taken for granted. Different motivations drive participation in different cohorts and different messaging/incentivisation is needed to encourage participation in those different cohorts. The findings reported here should inform any SARS-CoV-2 testing programme that will run in these types of settings in the future.","Barry, Gerald; McCarney, Catherine; Farrelly, Marc; Mooney, Carmel; Breathnach, Rory; More, Simon",,184,16

The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence and predictors of anxiety, depression and stress among young people diagnosed with COVID-19 of Bangladesh amidst the pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 1 May to 30 May 2020 using an online Google form-based questionnaire posted on Facebook. A snowball sampling approach was used for data collection. A total of 974 self-declared healthy individuals not diagnosed with COVID-19 participated here. Anxiety, depression and stress were measured using Bangla validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale, and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), respectively. Statistical software SPSS 20 was used for analysis. Result: Average age of the population was 25.86±6.26 (SD) years with nearly half (48.6%) of them being young people (15 to &#8804;24 years). Most of the participants were male (76.3%). The overall prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress was found to be 64.1%, 73.3% and 69.4%, respectively. Young people had significantly higher proportion of anxiety (67.2% vs 61.1%), and depression (78.2% vs 68.7%) compared to adults (p=0.045 and p<0.001, respectively). However, most of the participants had mild depression (30.3%), minimal anxiety (31.4%), and moderate stress (67.5%) and severity of depression and anxiety being higher in the young participants. The mean GAD-7, PHQ-9 and PSS scores were 7.57±5.61, 9.19±6.15 and 16.02±5.55 (SD), respectively.

This paper proposes a smart low-cost ventilation control strategy based on occupant-density-detection algorithm with consideration of both infection prevention and energy efficiency. The ventilation rate can be automatically adjusted between the demand-controlled mode and anti-infection mode with a self-developed low-cost hardware prototype. YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm was applied for occupancy detection based on video frames from surveillance cameras. Case studies show that, compared with a traditional ventilation mode (with 15% fixed fresh air ratio), the proposed ventilation control strategy can achieve 11.7% energy saving while lowering the infection probability to 2%. The developed ventilation control strategy provides a feasible and promising solution to prevent transmission of infection diseases (e.g., COVID-19) in public and private buildings, and also help to achieve a healthy yet sustainable indoor environment.","Wang, Junqi; Huang, Jingjing; Feng, Zhuangbo; Cao, Shi-Jie; Haghighat, Fariborz",Energy Build,184,20

The pathophysiology of COVID-19-related myocarditis is thought to be a combination of direct viral injury and cardiac damage due to the host’s immune response. COVID-19 myocarditis diagnosis should be guided by insights from previous coronavirus and other myocarditis experience. The clinical findings include changes in ECG, cardiac biomarkers, and impaired cardiac function. When cardiac MRI is infeasible, cardiac CT angiography with delayed myocardial imaging may serve to exclude significant coronary artery disease and identify myocardial inflammatory patterns. Because many COVID-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities, myocardial infarction should be considered. Where the diagnosis remains uncertain, an endomyocardial biopsy may help identify active cardiac infection through viral genome amplification and possibly refine the treatment risks of systemic immunosuppression. Arrhythmias are not uncommon in the COVID-19 patients; however, its pathophysiology is still speculative. Nevertheless, clinicians should be vigilant to provide prompt monitoring and treatments.

Since then there has been a rapid rise in development of maternal and perinatal health guidelines related to COVID-19. The aim of this project was to develop a database of Australian and international recommendations relating to antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care of women during the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to identify inconsistencies in clinical guidance. Methods : We conducted weekly web searches from 30th March to 15th May 2020 to identify recommendations pertaining to the care of women during pregnancy, labour and postpartum period from national or international professional societies, specialist colleges, Ministries of Health, Australian state and territory governments, and international guideline development organisations. Individual recommendations were extracted and classified according to intervention type, time period, and patient population. Findings were reported using descriptive analysis, with areas of consensus and non-consensus identified. Results We identified 81 guidelines from 48 different organisations. Generally, there was high consensus across guidelines for specific interventions. However, variable guidance was identified on the use of nitrous oxide during labour, administration of antenatal corticosteroids, neonatal isolation after birth, labour and birth companions, and the use of disease modifying agents for treating COVID-19. Conclusion Discrepancies between different guideline development organisations creates challenges for maternity care clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Collating recommendations and keeping up-to-date with the latest guidance can help clinicians provide the best possible care to pregnant women and their babies.","Pavlidis, Pollyanna; Eddy, Katherine; Phung, Laura; Farrington, Elise; Connolly, Mairead; Lopes, Rudy; Wilson, Alyce N.; Homer, Caroline S.E.; Vogel, Joshua P.",Women Birth,184,1

COVID-19 has resulted in numerous stressors for youth (e.g., school closures, social isolation) that directly disrupt sleep and may have negative mental health consequences. However, investigations of sleep and adverse events in youth have primarily been limited to months or years after a trauma has occurred. How adolescent sleep patterns and mental health intersect during an ongoing adverse experience is unknown. METHODS: Adolescents from the United States (N = 503; 80.9% female; 13–18 years) participated in an online daily diary study within 3 weeks after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency. Participants completed one week of twice daily reports (5406 observations) on their nightly sleep (sleep timing, sleep quality, sleep onset difficulties, and nightmares) and daytime mental health symptoms (COVID-19 PTSS, positive affect, negative affect, and loneliness). RESULTS: Mixed models adjusting for age, sex, and socioeconomic status indicated that cyclical, bidirectional effects emerged, with daytime mental health symptoms predicting same-night sleep disturbances, and sleep disturbances predicting next-day mental health. Greater PTSS predicted sleep onset difficulties (Estimate = .02, SE = .004, t = 5.56 p < .001) and sleep onset difficulties predicted next-day PTSS (Estimate = .35, SE = .17, t = 2.04, p < .05). Greater daytime negative affect predicted greater nightmares (Estimate = .07, SE = .01, t = 4.97, p < .001), and nightmares predicted marginally more next-day negative affect (Estimate = .07, SE = .04, t = 1.66, p = .09). PTSS (Estimate = .01, SE = .003, t = 3.47, p < .001) and negative affect (Estimate = .05, SE = .03, t = 2.06, p < .05) both predicted poorer sleep quality the following night. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that mental health symptoms during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with increased sleep disturbances. In turn, these sleep disturbances predict increased mental health symptoms. Overall, results provide a greater understanding of youth sleep patterns during COVID-19 and how sleep disturbances may inhibit resilience in the context of an ongoing stressor.

However, multiple variants have emerged with mutations in the spike protein amongst others, the key target of neutralising antibodies. We evaluated the neutralising efficacy of 89 serum samples from patients, infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the beginning of 2020, against two virus variants isolated from acutely infected patients and harbouring spike protein mutations. One isolate was assigned to lineage B.1.351 (MUC-IMB-B.1.351) whilst the other (MUC-484) was isolated from an immunocompromised patient, sharing some but not all mutations with B.1.351 and representing a transitional variant. Both variants showed a significant reduction in neutralisation sensitivity compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 with MUC-IMB-B.1.351 being almost completely resistant to neutralisation. The observed reduction in neutralising activity of wild-type-specific antibodies against both variants suggests that individual mutations in the spike protein are sufficient to confer a potent escape from the humoral immune response. In addition, the effect of escape mutations seems to accumulate, so that more heavily mutated variants show a greater loss of sensitivity to neutralisation up to complete insensitivity as observed for MUC-IMB-B.1.351. From a clinical point of view, this might affect the efficacy of (monoclonal) antibody treatment of patients with prolonged infections as well as patients infected with variants other than the donor. At the same, this could also negatively influence the efficacy of current vaccines (as they are based on wild-type spike protein) emphasising the need to thoroughly surveil the emergence and distribution of variants and adapt vaccines and therapeutics accordingly.","Müller, Katharina; Girl, Philipp; Giebl, Andreas; Gruetzner, Stefanie; Antwerpen, Markus; Khatamzas, Elham; Wölfel, Roman; von Buttlar, Heiner",Virus Genes,184,3

Intake, change in body weight, feed efficiency, morbidity and mortality, and selected plasma metabolites were determined. Body weight at 28 d, 56 d, daily body weight gain, intake of milk replacer, fecal scores, days with diarrhea, and days treated with antibiotics were increased with feeding variable amount of milk replacer over the 56-d study. Starter intake from d 1 to 56 was reduced from 919 to 717 g/d in calves fed fixed and variable amounts of milk replacer, respectively. Morbidity, measured as the number of days that calves had diarrhea, was increased by 53% when a variable amount of milk replacer was fed. Calves fed variable milk replacer were treated with antibiotics for 3.1 d compared with 1.9 d for calves fed 454g of milk replacer/d. Concentrations of plasma glucose, urea N, and insulin-like growth factor-I were increased when calves were fed variable amount of milk replacer. Dietary supplement containing bovine serum had no effect on any parameter measured. There was no effect of milk replacer feeding on concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids, total protein, or growth hormone concentrations. Plasma tumor necrosis factor-α was highest in calves with the highest plasma IgG concentrations on the day of arrival and might be related to the calf's ability to identify pathogens in the environment. Under conditions of this study, calves fed variable amount of milk replacer and exposed to immunological challenge before weaning had greater BW gain, but also increased incidence of diarrhea that required added veterinary treatments.","Quigley, J.

Findings from a cross-sectional study,21.383068,6.0771394,2021-06-23,"The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and is the causative agent for the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is a 29,811 nucleotides positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the betacoronavirus genus. Due to inefficient proofreading ability of the viral RNA-dependent polymerase complex, coronaviruses are known to acquire new mutations following replication, which constitutes one of the main factors driving the evolution of its genome and the emergence of new genetic variants. In the last few months, the identification of new B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa) and P.1 (Brazil) variants of concern (VOC) highlighted the importance of tracking the emergence of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and their impact on transmissibility, infectivity, and neutralizing antibody escape capabilities. These VOC demonstrate increased transmissibility and antibody escape, and reduce current vaccine efficacy. Here we analyzed the appearance and prevalence trajectory of mutations that appeared in all SARS-CoV-2 genes from December 2019 to January 2021. Our goals were to identify which modifications are the most frequent, study the dynamics of their spread, their incorporation into the consensus sequence, and their impact on virus biology. We also analyzed the structural properties of the spike glycoprotein of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 variants. This study offers an integrative view of the emergence, disappearance, and consensus sequence integration of successful mutations that constitute new SARS-CoV-2 variants and their impact on neutralizing antibody therapeutics and vaccines.","Castonguay, N.; Zhang, W.; Langlois, M.-A.",,184,9

However, the mechanisms underlying TGEV-induced apoptosis are still unclear. In this study we observed that TGEV infection induced apoptosis in porcine kidney (PK-15) cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. TGEV infection up-regulated FasL, activated FasL-mediated apoptotic pathway, leading to activation of caspase-8 and cleavage of Bid. In addition, TGEV infection down-regulated Bcl-2, up-regulated Bax expression, promoted translocation of Bax to mitochondria, activated mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway, which in turn caused the release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-9. Both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways activated downstream effector caspase-3, followed by the cleavage of PARP, resulting in cell apoptosis. Moreover, TGEV infection did not induce significant DNA fragmentation in ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl) pretreated PK-15 cells or cells infected with UV-inactivated TGEV. In turn, block of caspases activation also did not affect TGEV replication. Taken together, this study demonstrates that TGEV-induced apoptosis is dependent on viral replication in PK-15 cells and occurs through activation of FasL- and mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathways.","Ding, Li; Xu, Xingang; Huang, Yong; Li, Zhaocai; Zhang, Kuan; Chen, Guangda; Yu, Gaoshui; Wang, Zhisheng; Li, Wei; Tong, Dewen",Vet Microbiol,184,1

We found that non-structural proteins and accessory proteins NSP1, NSP7, NSP8, RdRp, ORF3b and ORF9b elicit prevalent IgG responses. The IgG patterns and dynamic of non-structural/ accessory proteins are different from that of S and N protein. The IgG responses against these 6 proteins are associated with disease severity and clinical outcome and declined sharply about 20 days after symptom onset. In non-survivors, sharp decrease of IgG antibodies against S1 and N protein before death was observed.

We aim to correlate those patients’ demographics, symptoms and comorbidities, with the risk of mortality from COVID-19, length of hospital stay, and time from diagnosis to definitive outcome. On the basis of a dataset provided by the Health Secretary of the State of Bahia, we selected 3,896 hospitalized patients from a total of 154,868 COVID-19 patients that included non-hospitalized patients and patients with invalid registration in the dataset. Then, we statistically analyzed whether there was a significant correlation between the patient record data and the COVID-19 pandemic, and our main findings reinforced by the use of a multivariable logistic regression were that older age (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.03, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.03-1.04, p-value (p) <0.001), an initial symptom of shortness of breath (OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.60-2.20, p < 0.001), and the presence of comorbidities, mainly chronic kidney disease (OR = 2.41, 95% CI = 1.67-3.48, p < 0.001) are related to an increased risk of mortality from COVID-19.

METHODS: A total of 535 COVID‐19 patients were recruited at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital. Information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, ocular symptoms, eye drop medication, eye protections, chronic eye diseases, systemic concomitant symptoms, radiologic findings and SARS‐CoV‐2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs by real‐time PCR was collected from questionnaires and electronic medical records. RESULTS: Of 535 patients, 27 patients (5.0%) presented with conjunctival congestion and 4 patients had conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom. The average duration of conjunctival congestion was 5.9 ± 4.5 days (mean [SD]). The other ocular symptoms, including increased conjunctival secretion, ocular pain, photophobia, dry eye and tearing, were also found in patients with conjunctival congestion. Notably, hand–eye contact was independently correlated with conjunctival congestion in COVID‐19 patients. We also found that some COVID‐19 patients had chronic eye diseases, including conjunctivitis (33, 6.2%), xerophthalmia (24, 4.5%) and keratitis (14, 2.6%). Similar to the published studies, the most common clinical symptoms were fever, cough and fatigue. A total of 343 patients (64.1%) had positive SARS‐CoV‐2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs. CONCLUSIONS: Conjunctival congestion is one of the COVID‐19‐related ocular symptoms, which could occur as the initial symptoms. Frequent hand–eye contact may be the risk factor for conjunctival congestion in COVID‐19 patients. Screening of patients with conjunctival congestion by ophthalmologists is advocated during the outbreak of COVID‐19. It is essential to provide eye‐care equipment and strengthen education on eye protection.","Chen, Liwen; Deng, Chaohua; Chen, Xuhui; Zhang, Xian; Chen, Bo; Yu, Huimin; Qin, Yuanjun; Xiao, Ke; Zhang, Hong; Sun, Xufang",Acta Ophthalmol,184,1

The aim of this study was to examine the use of weekly saliva RT‐qPCR testing for SARS‐CoV‐2 detection among NH workers as a strategy to control disease transmission within NHs in Belgium. From 16 November to 27 December 2020, a voluntary and anonymous weekly screening was implemented in a cohort of 50,000 workers across 572 NHs in the Walloon region of Belgium to detect asymptomatic cases of SARS‐CoV‐2 via saliva RT‐qPCR testing and using the Diagenode saliva sample collection device. Positive workers were isolated to avoid subsequent infections in residents and other staff. RT‐qPCR testing was based on pooled saliva sampling techniques from three workers, followed by individual testing of each positive or inconclusive pool. The majority of NHs (85%) and 55% of their workers participated. Pooling did not affect sensitivity as it only induced a very decrease in sensitivity estimated as 0.33%. Significant decreases in the prevalence (34.4–13.4%) and incidence of NHs with either single (13.8–2%) or multiple positive workers (3.7–0%) were observed over time. In addition, deaths among NH residents and NH worker absences decreased significantly over time. Weekly saliva RT‐qPCR testing for SARS‐CoV‐2 demonstrated large‐scale feasibility and efficacy in disrupting the chain of transmission. Implementation of this testing strategy in NHs could also be extended to other settings with the aim to control viral transmission for maintaining essential activities.","Saegerman, Claude; Donneau, Anne‐Françoise; Speybroeck, Niko; Diep, Anh Nguyet; Williams, Alexandria; Stamatakis, Lambert; Coppieters, Wouter; Michel, Fabienne; Breuer, Christophe; Dandoy, Margaux; Ek, Olivier; Gourzones, Claire; Schyns, Joey; Goffin, Emeline; Minner, Frédéric; Renault, Véronique; Gillet, Laurent; Bureau, Fabrice",Transbound Emerg Dis,184,1

METHODS: : Adults with VI (best-corrected visual acuity <20/60 in the better-seeing eye), HI (ICD-10 codes), and age- and sex-matched controls (n=375) were recruited from the University of Michigan. The 34-item Coronavirus Disability Survey was administered. Chi-squared and logistic regression were used to compare survey responses between groups. RESULTS: : All groups reported high levels of disruption of daily life with 80% reporting “a fair amount” or “a lot” of disruption (VI:76%, HI:83%, CT: 82%, p=0.33). Participants with VI had greater difficulty with day-to-day activities and were more likely to cite the following reasons: caregiver was worried about COVID-19 (OR(VI)=7.2, [95% CI 3.5-14.4], p<.001) and decreased availability of public transportation (OR(VI)=5.0, [95% CI 1.5-15.6], p=.006). Those with VI, but not HI, showed a trend toward increased difficulty accessing medical care (OR(VI)=2.0, [95% CI 0.99-4.0], p=.052) and they began relying more on others for day-to-day assistance (OR(VI)=3.1, [95% CI 1.6-5.7], p<.001).

METHODS: We constructed deterministic models to assess the health and economic impact of maternal HIV retesting on a hypothetical population of pregnant women, following initial testing in pregnancy, on MTCT in four countries: South Africa and Kenya (high/intermediate HIV prevalence), and Colombia and Ukraine (low HIV prevalence). We evaluated six scenarios with varying retesting frequencies from late in antenatal care (ANC) through nine months postpartum. We compared strategies using incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios (ICERs) over a 20‐year time horizon using country‐specific thresholds. RESULTS: We found maternal retesting once in late ANC with catch‐up testing through six weeks postpartum was cost‐effective in Kenya (ICER = $166 per DALY averted) and South Africa (ICER=$289 per DALY averted). This strategy prevented 19% (Kenya) and 12% (South Africa) of infant HIV infections. Adding one or two additional retests postpartum provided smaller benefits (1 to 2 percentage point increase in infections averted versus one retest). Adding three retests during the postpartum period averted additional infections (1 to 3 percentage point increase in infections averted versus one retest) but ICERs ($7639 and in Kenya and $11 985 in South Africa) greatly exceeded the cost‐effectiveness thresholds. In Colombia and Ukraine, all retesting strategies exceeded the cost‐effectiveness threshold and prevented few infant infections (up to 31 and 5 infections, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In high HIV burden settings with MTCT rates similar to those seen in Kenya and South Africa, HIV retesting once in late ANC, with subsequent intervention, is the most cost‐effective strategy for preventing infant HIV infections. In these settings, two HIV retests postpartum marginally reduced MTCT and were less costly than adding three retests. Retesting in low‐burden settings with MTCT rates similar to Colombia and Ukraine was not cost‐effective at any time point due to very low HIV prevalence and limited breastfeeding.","Meisner, Julianne; Roberts, D Allen; Rodriguez, Patricia; Sharma, Monisha; Newman Owiredu, Morkor; Gomez, Bertha; de Mello, Maeve B; Bobrik, Alexey; Vodianyk, Arkadii; Storey, Andrew; Githuka, George; Chidarikire, Thato; Barnabas, Ruanne; Farid, Shiza; Essajee, Shaffiq; Jamil, Muhammad S; Baggaley, Rachel; Johnson, Cheryl; Drake, Alison L",J Int AIDS Soc,184,24

Replication mainly occurred in alveolar cells but also in epithelial cells of nasal mucosa, trachea, bronchi, bronchioli, in alveolar macrophages and in tonsils. After primary replication in the respiratory tract, viraemia occurred. Virus also reached the gastrointestinal tract after swallowing. Subsequently, PRCV was observed to replicate in the ileum. The infection spread within a few days from the ileum to the duodenum. Replication in the small intestine remained limited to a few cells located in or underneath the epithelial layer of villi and, or, crypts. The cell type could not be identified. Virus was isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes in all pigs, but immunofluorescence was not observed.

To explore the validity of the tool, we considered both diet quality as an outcome of NL, and health literacy (HL) as a construct that presents similarities and differences with NL. Diet quality was measured by adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (Med diet) through the validated Mediterranean Diet Literature-based adherence score (MEDI-Lite). The relationship between NL level and adherence to Med diet was assessed by linear regression analysis and computing correlations between NLit-IT and MEDI-Lite scores (Spearman’s Rho). Additionally, we evaluated the correlation between NLit-IT score and the level of HL (Spearman’s Rho). Internal consistency and reliability were measured by Cronbach’s alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) respectively. Internal consistency (ρT = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.69–0.84) and reliability (ICC = 0.68, 95% CI, 0.46–0.85) were confirmed.

The case severity and fatality of COVID-19 are associated with excessive inflammation, namely, a cytokine storm. Metformin, a widely used drug to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) mellitus and metabolic syndrome, has immunomodulatory activity that reduces the production of proinflammatory cytokines using macrophages and causes the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Metformin also inhibits the cytokine production of pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells. Importantly, treatment with metformin alleviates various lung injuries in preclinical animal models. In addition, a recent proteomic study revealed that metformin has the potential to directly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, retrospective clinical studies have revealed that metformin treatment reduces the mortality of T2D with COVID-19. Therefore, metformin has the potential to be repurposed to treat patients with COVID-19 at risk of developing severe illness. This review summarizes the immune pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and addresses the effects of metformin on inhibiting cytokine storms and preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as its side effects.","Chen, Xianyang; Guo, Huifang; Qiu, Li; Zhang, Chengdong; Deng, Qiang; Leng, Qibin",Front Immunol,184,21

EBOV infection causes Ebola virus disease (EVD), characterized by coagulopathy, lymphopenia, and multi-organ failure, which can culminate in death. In 2019, the FDA approved the first vaccine against EBOV, a recombinant live-attenuated viral vector wherein the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus is replaced with the glycoprotein (GP) of EBOV (rVSV-EBOV-GP, Ervebo(®) by Merck). This vaccine demonstrates high efficacy in nonhuman primates by providing prophylactic, rapid, and post-exposure protection. In humans, rVSV-EBOV-GP demonstrated 100% protection in several phase III clinical trials in over 10,000 individuals during the 2013–2016 West Africa epidemic. As of 2020, over 218,000 doses of rVSV-EBOV-GP have been administered to individuals with high risk of EBOV exposure. Despite licensure and robust preclinical studies, the mechanisms of rVSV-EBOV-GP-mediated protection are not fully understood. Such knowledge is crucial for understanding vaccine-mediated correlates of protection from EVD and to aid the further design and development of therapeutics against filoviruses. Here, we summarize the current literature regarding the host response to vaccination and EBOV exposure, and evidence regarding innate and adaptive immune mechanisms involved in rVSV-EBOV-GP-mediated protection, with a focus on the host transcriptional response. Current data strongly suggest a protective synergy between rapid innate and humoral immunity.","Pinski, Amanda N.; Messaoudi, Ilhem",Microorganisms,184,1

This paper is the second part of a series of articles that explore the intricate relationship between the different challenges that have hindered biomedical research and the generation of novel scientific knowledge during the COVID‐19 pandemic. In the first part of this series, we demonstrated that, in the context of COVID‐19, the scientific community has been faced with numerous challenges with respect to (1) finding and prioritizing relevant research questions and (2) choosing study designs that are appropriate for a time of emergency. METHODS: During the early stages of the pandemic, research conducted on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) sparked several heated debates with respect to the scientific methods used and the quality of knowledge generated. Research on HCQ is used as a case study in both papers. The authors explored biomedical databases, peer‐reviewed journals, pre‐print servers and media articles to identify relevant literature on HCQ and COVID‐19, and examined philosophical perspectives on medical research in the context of this pandemic and previous global health challenges. RESULTS: This second paper demonstrates that a lack of research prioritization and methodological rigour resulted in the generation of fleeting and inconsistent evidence that complicated the development of public health guidelines. The reporting of scientific findings to the scientific community and general public highlighted the difficulty of finding a balance between accuracy and speed. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID‐19 pandemic presented challenges in terms of (3) evaluating evidence for the purpose of making evidence‐based decisions and (4) sharing scientific findings with the rest of the scientific community. This second paper demonstrates that the four challenges outlined in the first and second papers have often compounded each other and have contributed to slowing down the creation of novel scientific knowledge during the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Perillat, Lucie; Baigrie, Brian S.",J Eval Clin Pract,184,1

Furthermore, a comparison between the concentration of various air pollutants and the air quality index during the lockdown period and last two years, 2018 and 2019, has been presented. RESULTS: From the experimental work, it has been observed that the pollutants ozone and toluene have increased during the lockdown period. It has also been deduced that the pollutants that may impact the mortalities due to COVID-19 are ozone, NH(3), NO(2), and PM(10.)

About 33% were associated with a Tablighi Jamaat religious mass gathering held in Kuala Lumpur between February 27 and March 3, 2020, which drove community transmission during Malaysia’s second wave. We analysed genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from Malaysia to better understand the molecular epidemiology and spread. We obtained 58 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences from patients in Kuala Lumpur and performed phylogenetic analyses on these and a further 57 Malaysian sequences available in the GISAID database. Nine different SARS-CoV-2 lineages (A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.1, B.1.36, B.2, B.3 and B.6) were detected in Malaysia. The B.6 lineage was first reported a week after the Tablighi mass gathering and became predominant (65.2%) despite being relatively rare (1.4%) globally. Direct epidemiological links between lineage B.6 viruses and the mass gathering were identified. Increases in reported total cases, Tablighi-associated cases, and community-acquired B.6 lineage strains were temporally linked. Non-B.6 lineages were mainly travel-associated and showed limited onward transmission. There were also temporally correlated increases in B.6 sequences in other Southeast Asian countries, India and Australia, linked to participants returning from this event. Over 95% of global B.6 sequences originated from Asia Pacific. We also report a nsp3-C6310A substitution found in 47.3% of global B.6 sequences which was associated with reduced sensitivity using a commercial diagnostic real-time PCR assay. Lineage B.6 became the predominant cause of community transmission in Malaysia after likely introduction during a religious mass gathering. This event also contributed to spikes of lineage B.6 in other countries in the Asia-Pacific. Mass gatherings can be significant causes of local and global spread of COVID-19. Shared genomic surveillance can be used to identify SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains to aid prevention and control, and to monitor diagnostic molecular assays.

The possible interactions between surfaces of such nanostructured materials with coronaviruses are discussed. The antiviral mechanisms of graphene materials can be related to events such as the inactivation of virus and/or the host cell receptor, electrostatic trapping and physico-chemical destruction of viral species. These effects can be enhanced by functionalization and/or decoration of carbons with species that enhances graphene-virus interactions.

Non-adherence to self-isolation for 7 days after the development of symptoms is considered suboptimal and little is known about adherence to quarantine for 14 days if a co-habitant developed symptoms. This study aims to analyse non-adherence behaviours to self-isolation and quarantine measures by identifying their potential psycho-social and demographic predictors and by exploring people’s accounts of their experiences with these measures. A mixed-methods convergent design was used, comprising an online survey (n = 681) completed by residents in six North London boroughs and qualitative interviews with a subsample of participants (n = 16). Findings identified not accessing community support, lack of control over leaving the house, and lack of perceived benefit and need to follow the rules as behaviours associated with non-adherence to quarantine (42.7%). Non-adherence to self-isolating measures (24.4%) was associated with individuals’ perceived lack of control over responsibilities, lack of control over leaving the house, uncertainty about symptoms experienced, lack of access to tests, and distrust in the Government. Adherence to self-isolation and quarantine could be improved through strengthening perceived benefit to self-isolate with messages emphasising its effectiveness, by implementing a two-way information system to support symptoms identification, and with Government-funded, locally supported packages at different levels (financial, food, and practical needs).","Eraso, Yolanda; Hills, Stephen",Int J Environ Res Public Health,184,24

However, most countries, including those with widely available critical care services, lack sufficient specialized staff, medical equipment, and ICU space to provide timely, usual critical care for a large influx of additional patients. Shifting critical care disaster preparedness efforts to augment limited, essential critical care (emergency mass critical care [EMCC]), rather than to marginally increase unrestricted, individual-focused critical care may provide many additional people with access to life-sustaining interventions. In 2007, in response to the increasing concern over a severe influenza pandemic, the Task Force on Mass Critical Care (hereafter called the Task Force) convened to suggest the essential critical care therapeutics and interventions for EMCC. TASK FORCE SUGGESTIONS: EMCC should include the following: (1) mechanical ventilation, (2) IV fluid resuscitation, (3) vasopressor administration, (4) medication administration for specific disease states (eg, antimicrobials and antidotes), (5) sedation and analgesia, and (6) select practices to reduce adverse consequences of critical illness and critical care delivery. Also, all hospitals with ICUs should prepare to deliver EMCC for a daily critical care census at three times their usual ICU capacity for up to 10 days. DISCUSSION: By using the Task Force suggestions for EMCC, communities may better prepare to deliver augmented critical care in response to disasters. In light of current mass critical care data limitations, the Task Force suggestions were developed to guide preparedness but are not intended as strict policy mandates. Additional research is required to evaluate EMCC and revise the strategy as warranted.","Rubinson, Lewis; Hick, John L.; Hanfling, Dan G.; Devereaux, Asha V.; Dichter, Jeffrey R.; Christian, Michael D.; Talmor, Daniel; Medina, Justine; Curtis, J.

In this study we focus on gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT), where active screening was suspended in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) due to the pandemic. We use two independent mathematical models to predict the impact of COVID-19 interruptions on transmission and reporting, and the achievement of 2030 elimination of transmission (EOT) goal for gHAT in two moderate-risk regions of DRC. We consider different interruption scenarios, including reduced passive surveillance in fixed health facilities, and whether this suspension lasts until the end of 2020 or 2021. Our models predict an increase in the number of new infections in the interruption period only if both active screening and passive surveillance were suspended, and with slowed reduction - but no increase - if passive surveillance remains fully functional. In all scenarios, the EOT may be slightly pushed back if no mitigation such as increased screening coverage is put in place. However, we emphasise that the biggest challenge will remain in the higher prevalence regions where EOT is already predicted to be behind schedule without interruptions unless interventions are bolstered.","Aliee, M.; Castano, S.; Davis, C.; Patel, S.; Miaka, E.

OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to determine Chinese netizens’ concerns related to COVID-19 and the relationship between their concerns and information on the internet. We also aimed to elucidate the association between individuals’ levels of concern, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-19. METHODS: The questionnaire, which consisted of 15 closed-ended questions, was designed to investigate Chinese netizens’ knowledge about COVID-19. The self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit participants through Dingxiangyisheng WeChat (a public, medical, and health service platform in China) accounts. Standard descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to analyze the data. RESULTS: In total, 10,304 respondents were surveyed on the internet (response rate=1.75%; 10,304/590,000). Nearly all (n=9803, 95.30%) participants were concerned about “confirmed cases” of COVID-19, and 87.70% (n=9036) received information about the outbreak through social media websites. There were significant differences in participants’ concerns by sex (P=.02), age (P<.001), educational attainment (P=.001), and occupation (P<.001). All knowledge questions and preventive practices were associated with concerns about COVID-19.

CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidated Chinese netizens’ concerns, information sources, and preventive behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sex, educational attainment, occupation and employment status, knowledge acquisition, and level of concern were key factors associated with proper preventive behaviors.

Besides molecular approaches and indirect tests, the use of surrogate viruses with similar biophysical properties and genomic structure allows the assessment of virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants in quantitative suspension tests. Furthermore, insights into the survival of these viruses in the environment are possible. In recent years, duck hepatitis B virus and bovine viral diarrhoea virus have been tested as surrogates for hepatitis B and C viruses. Feline calicivirus serves as a surrogate for the group of norovirus. By including these viruses in inactivation experiments, valuable data from suspension tests can be derived on the virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants. Even in vivo tests using fingerpads of adult volunteers can be performed with these animal viruses without risk of infection. In contrast to in vitro examinations, the results of these tests allow use recommendations of chemical disinfectants for outbreak situations and daily routine disinfection.","Steinmann, J",J Hosp Infect,184,16

Under global scrutiny, China has started reviving the social, cultural, and working lives of its inhabitants. However, localized outbreaks of COVID-19 are occurring, indicating that the country still needs to follow disease prevention and control measures. Previous studies have assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of the general public in China regarding COVID-19 during the pandemic. However, little is known about knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of Chinese residents regarding COVID-19 after periods of lockdown. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the KAP and other factors among the residents of Shaanxi Province during the post-lockdown period. Methods: A cross-sectional, network questionnaire survey was conducted in Shaanxi Province from October 1–30, 2020. A total of 1,175 urban residents were interviewed via Wen Juan Xing, an online questionnaire tool. A self-developed online KAP COVID-19 questionnaire was developed in this study. The questionnaire consisted of four parts: general information, knowledge, attitude, and practice. Descriptive statistics and binomial logistic regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis. Results: The majority of the participants were knowledgeable about COVID-19. They had optimistic attitudes and behaved appropriately toward COVID-19. Education was an associated factor for the knowledge of residents and the knowledge of COVID-19 was high among people with high academic qualifications. Attitudes were more positive in residents who lived with elderly people, women, and children. The score of practice was higher in residents with positive attitudes and high academic qualifications. There was a positive correlation between age and practice. Conclusion: We found that the KAP of residents in Shaanxi was at a relatively high level during the post-lockdown period. Although the lockdown was lifted, the epidemic is not over. Thus, it is necessary to develop targeted health education programs for residents with different demographic characteristics in Shaanxi.","Xu, Na; Zhang, Yongai; Zhang, Xiaona; Zhang, Guangwei; Guo, Zikai; Zhao, Nan; Li, Fei",Front Public Health,184,16

Methods: In this retrospective, single centre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients with confirmed COVID-19, who had been discharged or died by April 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were extracted from medical records. Results: 173 patients were included in this study, of whom 56 resulted positive for COVID-19 and 117 resulted negative for COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were older, had a different distribution regarding admission diagnoses, including cerebrovascular disorders, and had a higher quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score on admission (all p<0.05). In-hospital mortality rates and incident delirium were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (all p<0.05). COVID-19 and non-COVID patients with stroke had similar baseline characteristics but patients with COVID-19 had higher modified Rankin scale scores at discharge (p<0.0001), with a significantly lower number of patients with a good outcome (p<0.0001).

Generally, the reduction in the population size that accompanies abrupt environmental changes makes it difficult to generate and select adaptive mutations. However, in systems with high genetic diversity, as happens in RNA viruses, mutations with beneficial effects under new conditions can already be present in the population, facilitating adaptation. In this work, we have propagated an RNA bacteriophage (Qβ) at temperatures higher than the optimum, following different patterns of change. We have determined the fitness values and the consensus sequences of all lineages throughout the evolutionary process in order to establish correspondences between fitness variations and adaptive pathways. Our results show that populations subjected to a sudden temperature change gain fitness and fix mutations faster than those subjected to gradual changes, differing also in the particular selected mutations. The life-history of populations prior to the environmental change has great importance in the dynamics of adaptation. The conclusion is that in the bacteriophage Qβ, the standing genetic diversity together with the rate of temperature change determine both the rapidity of adaptation and the followed evolutionary pathways.","Somovilla, Pilar; Manrubia, Susanna; Lázaro, Ester",Pathogens,184,24

The most typical examples are South Africa and Peru (before official correction), wherein the confirmed deaths are only one third of the excess deaths.

A corollary benefit is a potential fit in terms of the need for equitable and timely access to mental health services in remote and rural locations. Owing to COVID-19, there may be an increase in the demand for timely, virtual delivery of services among trauma-affected populations, including public safety personnel (PSP; eg, paramedics, police, fire, correctional officers), military members, and veterans. There is a lack of evidence on the question of whether digital delivery of trauma-therapies for military members, veterans, and PSP leads to similar outcomes to in-person delivery. Information on barriers and facilitators and recommendations regarding digital-delivery is also scarce. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the scope and quality of peer-reviewed literature on psychotherapeutic digital health interventions delivered remotely to military members, veterans, and PSP and synthesize the knowledge of needs, gaps, barriers to, and facilitators for virtual assessment of and virtual interventions for posttraumatic stress injury. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified using MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica dataBASE), APA (American Psychological Association) PsycINFO, CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature) Plus with Full Text, and Military & Government Collection. For collation, analysis, summarizing, and reporting of results, we used the CASP (Critical Skills Appraisal Program) qualitative checklist, PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) scale, level of evidence hierarchy, PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews), and narrative synthesis. RESULTS: A total of 38 studies were included in this review. Evidence for the effectiveness of digital delivery of prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing therapy, behavioral activation treatment with therapeutic exposure to military members, veterans, and PSP was rated level 1a, whereas evidence for cognitive behavioral therapy was conflicting. The narrative synthesis indicated that virtual delivery of these therapies can be as effective as in-person delivery but may reduce stigma and cost while increasing access to therapy. Issues of risk, safety, potential harm (ie, suicidality, enabling avoidance), privacy, security, and the match among the therapist, modality, and patient warrant further consideration. There is a lack of studies on the influences of gender, racial, and cultural factors that may result in differential outcomes, preferences, and/or needs. An investigation into other therapies that may be suitable for digital delivery is needed. CONCLUSIONS: Digital delivery of trauma therapies for military members, veterans, and PSP is a critical area for further research. Although promising evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of digital health within these populations, many questions remain, and a cautious approach to more widespread implementation is warranted.","Jones, Chelsea; Miguel-Cruz, Antonio; Smith-MacDonald, Lorraine; Cruikshank, Emily; Baghoori, Delaram; Kaur Chohan, Avneet; Laidlaw, Alexa; White, Allison; Cao, Bo; Agyapong, Vincent; Burback, Lisa; Winkler, Olga; Sevigny, Phillip R; Dennett, Liz; Ferguson-Pell, Martin; Greenshaw, Andrew; Brémault-Phillips, Suzette",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,184,16

We designed a CVVHD protocol with a high cut-off (HCO) filter in regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA). The HCO filter in diffusion determines the enhanced cytokines clearance with less filter clotting due to a lower filtration fraction. In our hospital, at the beginning of the pandemic outbreak, we treated seven COVID-19 patients with AKI stage 2 and 3 and recorded the circuit lifespan and the number of interventions on monitors. CVVHD in RCA appears to be safe, effective and easy to be performed in a biohazard scenario using lower blood flows and less bag changes with fluid savings, a biohazard reduction and sparing of resources.

This study reviews the relatively new drug safety surveillance system in China and compares it with the systems in the United States and Europe. Methods An extensive literature review was conducted in the following four areas: 1) the organizational structure of the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) in China; 2) the development of an adverse drug reaction (ADR) monitoring system in China; 3) regulatory issues related to drug safety in China; and 4) similarities and differences between drug safety surveillance in China and surveillance in the United States and Europe. Results The SFDA oversees an extensive network of drug safety “watchdogs,” including the China National Center for ADR Monitoring and 32 regional centers throughout China. China's system has faced a number of recent challenges. It has had to respond quickly to the withdrawal of various high-profile drugs like Vioxx (rofecoxib) and Baycol (cerivastatin) from other markets. Together with China's Ministry of Health, the SFDA has faced several unique drug safety events. Three of those events, involving the injectable form of the heartleaf houttuyinia herb (Yu Xing Cao), Armillarisni A injections, and clindamycin glucose infusions (Xinfu), are discussed. The rapid development of drug safety surveillance in China is manifested in extensive organizational structure, development of large databases, and laws and regulations supporting drug safety. The two major laws are the China Drug Administration Law issued in February 2001 and the Regulation for the Administration of ADR Reporting and Monitoring issued in March 2004. The study also discusses and compares recent developments in drug safety surveillance in the United States and the European Union. These developments will most likely have implications for the Chinese system in the near future. Conclusions While postmarketing surveillance guidelines are not yet available in China, we fully expect their eventual issuance after adaptation to the particular culture and clinical practices in China.","Du, Wenmin; Guo, Jeff J.; Jing, Yonghua; Li, Xing; Kelton, Christina M.L.",Value in Health,184,1

Computed tomography (CT) findings, such as a spot sign have been shown to be an independent predictor of poor outcome. We have recently encountered a succession of ICH patients who presented with a peculiar imaging finding, which we term the spot on a string sign. This is a rare imaging finding, and interestingly, all these patients presented to our institution over the last few weeks. METHODS: This was a single high-volume center series of patients who presented to our institution between 1 April and 21 May 2020. All patients underwent initial non-contrast CT brain and subsequent CT angiography (CTA). We also present laboratory and clinical data. Our primary measure was the presence of the spot on a string sign on the CTA. We also report the clinical course of these patients. RESULTS: In this study seven large-volume ICH patients with this imaging sign were identified, with a median age of 48 years (range 30–68 years). All had tested negative for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). CONCLUSION: We have described an unusual imaging finding in a cohort of younger patients with large-volume ICH, all of whom presented in a 2-month period to a high-volume neurovascular unit. The cause of these ICH presentations and associated imaging findings are unclear, but we encourage other clinicians to be aware of and vigilant for this rare phenomenon, especially in younger patients with such a bleeding pattern.","Nicholson, Patrick; Gao, Meah; Radovanovic, Ivan; Mendes-Pereira, Vitor; Hodaie, Mojgan; Pikula, Aleksandra; Krings, Timo",Clin Neuroradiol,184,26

IB is mainly controlled by biosecurity and vaccines, although, it is a very challenging issue because the viral populations are constantly evolving by several factors. One of these factors is the same vaccines used for IB control, this could explain by recombination, reversion to virulence, or by favoring virus serotype selection. Thus, a human role in the change of viral populations can be identified by the IBV vaccine usage, this must be considered to achieve effective IB control. ABSTRACT: Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) remains one of the most important diseases impacting poultry today. Its high adaptive capacity, attributable to the high mutation rate associated with its ssRNA(+), is one of its more important features. While biosecurity procedures and barriers have been shown to be preponderant factors in minimizing the impact of infectious bronchitis (IB), the environment and procedures associated with intensive poultry systems greatly influence the viral population dynamics. High-density poultry flocks facilitate recombination between different viruses, and even with live attenuated vaccines, which can change the dominant circulating field strains. Furthermore, the remaining issue of reversion to virulence gives rise to significant problems when vaccinal strains are introduced in places where their pathogenic variants have not been reported. Under specific conditions, live attenuated vaccines could also change the frequency of circulating viruses and enable replacement between different field strains. In summary, under a comprehensive approach, while vaccination is one of the most essential tools for controlling IB, the veterinarians, farmers, and official services role in its usage is central to minimizing alteration in a malleable viral population. Otherwise, vaccination is ultimately counterproductive.","Guzmán, Miguel; Hidalgo, Héctor",Animals (Basel),184,3

It is considered one of the most critical innate immune mechanisms that limits pathogen proliferation and propagation before the initiation of the adaptive immune response. Recent studies investigating the cellular responses to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection have revealed that coronaviruses can alter cellular homeostasis and promote cell death, providing evidence that the modulation of apoptotic pathways is important for viral replication and propagation. Despite the genetic diversity among different coronavirus clades and the infection of different cell types and several hosts, research studies in animal coronaviruses indicate that apoptosis in host cells is induced by common molecular mechanisms and apoptotic pathways. We summarize and critically review current knowledge on the molecular aspects of cell-death regulation during animal coronaviruses infection and the viral–host interactions to this process. Future research is expected to lead to a better understanding of the regulation of cell death during coronavirus infection. Moreover, investigating the role of viral proteins in this process will help us to identify novel antiviral targets related to apoptotic signaling pathways.","Gioti, Katerina; Kottaridi, Christine; Voyiatzaki, Chrysa; Chaniotis, Dimitrios; Rampias, Theodoros; Beloukas, Apostolos",Life (Basel),184,16

Patients with comorbidities are most vulnerable to this disease. Therefore, cancer patients are reported to be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection, particularly lung cancer patients. To evaluate the probable reasons behind the excessive susceptibility and fatality of lung cancer patients to COVID-19 infection, we targeted the two most crucial agents, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and C-X-C motif 10 (CXCL10). ACE2 is a receptor protein that plays a vital role in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell and CXCL10 is a cytokine mainly responsible for the lung cell damage involving in a cytokine storm. By using the UALCAN and GEPIA2 databases, we observed that ACE2 and CXCL10 are mostly overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). We then identified the functional significance of ACE2 and CXCL10 in lung cancer development by determining the genetic alteration frequency in their amino acid sequences using the cBioPortal web portal. Lastly, we did the pathological assessment of targeted genes using the PANTHER database. Here, we found that ACE2 and CXCL10 along with their commonly co-expressed genes are involved respectively in the binding activity and immune responses in case of lung cancer and COVID-19 infection. Finally, based on this systemic analysis, we concluded that ACE2 and CXCL10 are two possible biomarkers responsible for the higher susceptibility and fatality of lung cancer patients towards the COVID-19.","Mahmood, Tousif Bin; Chowdhury, Afrin Sultana; Hossain, Mohammad Uzzal; Hasan, Mehedee; Mizan, Shagufta; Aakil, Md.

Previously, we showed that the cellular factor TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE), activated by the spike protein of SARS-CoV (SARS-S protein), was positively involved in viral entry, implying that TACE is a possible target for developing antiviral compounds. To demonstrate this possibility, we here tested the effects of TACE inhibitors on viral entry. In vitro and in vivo data revealed that the TACE inhibitor TAPI-2 attenuated entry of both pseudotyped virus expressing the SARS-S protein in a lentiviral vector backbone and infectious SARS-CoV. TAPI-2 blocked both the SARS-S protein-induced shedding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV, and TNF-α production in lung tissues. Since the downregulation of ACE2 by SARS-S protein was proposed as an etiological event in the severe clinical manifestations, our data suggest that TACE antagonists block SARS-CoV infection and also attenuate its severe clinical outcome.","Haga, Shiori; Nagata, Noriyo; Okamura, Tadashi; Yamamoto, Norio; Sata, Tetsutaro; Yamamoto, Naoki; Sasazuki, Takehiko; Ishizaka, Yukihito",Antiviral Res,184,19

The degree of lymphocyte count reduction is related to COVID-19 severity and could be used as an indicator to reflect the disease severity. Our aim was to investigate the value of lymphocyte count in determining COVID-19 severity and estimating the time for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results to turn negative. We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 201 patients with severe and critical COVID-19. The patients were admitted to the West Campus of Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The data included age, gender, chronic disease, lymphocyte count, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results. The age of patients in critically ill group was higher than in severely ill group (p = 0.019). The lymphocyte count of critically ill patients was lower than of severely ill patients. The cutoff value of lymphocyte count to distinguish between the critically ill and the severely ill was 0.735 × 10(9)/L (p = 0.001). The cutoff value of lymphocyte count for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results turning negative in severely and critically ill patients with chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease) was 0.835 × 10(9)/L (p = 0.017). The cutoff value of lymphocyte count for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results turning negative in severely and critically ill male patients was 0.835 × 10(9)/L (p < 0.0001). Lymphocyte count could be an effective indicator to predict COVID-19 severity. It may also be useful in determining the time for nucleic acid test results to turn negative in COVID-19 patients with underlying chronic diseases or male COVID-19 patients with severe and critical conditions.","Li, Yuanchao; Yang, Tuoyun; Wang, Sicong; Zheng, Junbo; Zhou, Jing; Jiang, Min; Zhou, Tong; Cao, Yang; Wang, Hongliang",Bosn J Basic Med Sci,184,16

The psychological impact on frontline doctors of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic is currently unknown. This longitudinal professional survey aims to understand the evolving and cumulative effects of working during the COVID-19 outbreak on the psychological well-being of doctors working in emergency departments (ED), intensive care units (ICU) and anaesthetics during the pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a longitudinal questionnaire-based study with three predefined time points spanning the acceleration, peak and deceleration phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary outcomes are psychological distress and post-trauma stress as measured by the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) and Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R). Data related to personal and professional characteristics will also be collected. Questionnaires will be administered prospectively to all doctors working in ED, ICU and anaesthetics in the UK and Ireland via existing research networks during the sampling period. Data from the questionnaires will be analysed to assess the prevalence and degree of psychological distress and trauma, and the nature of the relationship between personal and professional characteristics and the primary outcomes. Data will be described, analysed and disseminated at each time point; however, the primary endpoint will be psychological distress and trauma at the final time point. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Bath, UK (ref: 4421), and Children’s Health Ireland at Crumlin, Ethics Committee. Regulatory approval from the Health Regulation Authority (UK), Health and Care Research Wales (IRAS: 281944). This study is limited by the fact that it focuses on doctors only and is survey based without further qualitative interviews of participants.

Saudi Arabia, like many other countries worldwide, implemented lockdown of most public and private services in response to the pandemic and established population movement restrictions nationwide. With the implementation of these strict mitigation regulations, technology and digital solutions have enabled the provision of essential services. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to highlight how Saudi Arabia has used digital technology during the COVID-19 pandemic in the domains of public health, health care services, education, telecommunication, commerce, and risk communication. METHODS: We documented the use of digital technology in Saudi Arabia during the pandemic using publicly available official announcements, press briefings and releases, news clips, published data, peer-reviewed literature, and professional discussions. RESULTS: Saudi Arabia’s government and private sectors combined developed and launched approximately 19 apps and platforms that serve public health functions and provide health care services. A detailed account of each is provided. Education processes continued using an established electronic learning infrastructure with a promising direction toward wider adoption in the future. Telecommunication companies exhibited smooth collaboration as well as innovative initiatives to support ongoing efforts. Risk communication activities using social media, websites, and SMS text messaging followed best practice guides. CONCLUSIONS: The Saudi Vision 2030 framework, released in 2017, has paved the path for digital transformation. COVID-19 enabled the promotion and testing of this transition. In Saudi Arabia, the use of artificial intelligence in integrating different data sources during future outbreaks could be further explored. Also, decreasing the number of mobile apps and merging their functions could increase and facilitate their use.","Hassounah, Marwah; Raheel, Hafsa; Alhefzi, Mohammed",J Med Internet Res,184,10

It is surprising that the total number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and the number of deaths has varied greatly across countries. Such great variations are caused by age population, health conditions, travel, economy, and environmental factors. Here, we investigated which national factors (life expectancy, aging index, human development index, percentage of malnourished people in the population, extreme poverty, economic ability, health policy, population, age distributions, etc.) influenced the spread of COVID-19 through systematic statistical analysis. First, we employed segmented growth curve models (GCMs) to model the cumulative confirmed cases for 134 countries from 1 January to 31 August 2020 (logistic and Gompertz). Thus, each country’s COVID-19 spread pattern was summarized into three growth-curve model parameters. Secondly, we investigated the relationship of selected 31 national factors (from KOSIS and Our World in Data) to these GCM parameters. Our analysis showed that with time, the parameters were influenced by different factors; for example, the parameter related to the maximum number of predicted cumulative confirmed cases was greatly influenced by the total population size, as expected. The other parameter related to the rate of spread of COVID-19 was influenced by aging index, cardiovascular death rate, extreme poverty, median age, percentage of population aged 65 or 70 and older, and so forth. We hope that with their consideration of a country’s resources and population dynamics that our results will help in making informed decisions with the most impact against similar infectious diseases.","Kim, Hakyong; Apio, Catherine; Ko, Yeonghyeon; Han, Kyulhee; Goo, Taewan; Heo, Gyujin; Kim, Taehyun; Chung, Hye Won; Lee, Doeun; Lim, Jisun; Park, Taesung",Int J Environ Res Public Health,184,14

Design Ecological analysis of data from the CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) and from the CDC’s Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program. Setting and Participants CMS-certified nursing homes participating in both NHSN and the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program. Methods A multivariable, random intercepts, negative binomial model was applied to contrast COVID-19 incidence rates among residents living in facilities with an initial vaccination clinic during the week ending January 3, 2021 (n=2,843) versus those living in facilities with no vaccination clinic reported up to and including the week ending January 10, 2021 (n=3,216). Model covariates included: bed size, resident SARS-CoV-2 testing, staff with COVID-19, cumulative COVID-19 among residents, residents admitted with COVID-19, community county incidence, and county social-vulnerability index (SVI). Results In December 2020 and January 2021, incidence of COVID-19 among nursing home residents declined to the lowest point since reporting began in May, diverged from the pattern in community cases, and began dropping before vaccination occurred. Comparing week 3 following an initial vaccination clinic versus week 2, the adjusted reduction in COVID-19 rate in vaccinated facilities was 27% greater than the reduction in facilities where vaccination clinics had not yet occurred (95% confidence interval: 14–38%, p<0.05). Conclusions and Implications Vaccination of residents contributed to the decline in COVID-19 incidence in nursing homes; however other factors also contributed. The decline in COVID-19 was evident prior to widespread vaccination highlighting the benefit of a multifaced approach to prevention including continued use of recommended screening, testing and infection prevention practices as well as vaccination to keep residents in nursing homes safe.","Benin, Andrea L.; Soe, Minn M.; Edwards, Jonathan R.; Bagchi, Suparna; Link-Gelles, Ruth; Schrag, Stephanie J.; Herzer, Kurt; Verani, Jennifer R.; Budnitz, Daniel; Nanduri, Srinivas; Jernigan, John; Edens, Chris; Gharpure, Radhika; Patel, Anita; Wu, Hsiu; Golshir, Beth C.; Jaffe, Aaron; Li, Qunna; Srinivasan, Arjun; Shulman, Evan; Ling, Shari M.; Moody-Williams, Jean; Fleisher, Lee A.; Pollock, Daniel A.; Bell, Jeneita",J Am Med Dir Assoc,184,15

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to characterize the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of social media users located at the initial epicenter of the outbreak by analyzing data from the Sina Weibo platform in Chinese. METHODS: We used web scraping to collect public Weibo posts from December 31, 2019, to January 20, 2020, from users located in Wuhan City that contained COVID-19–related keywords. We then manually annotated all posts using an inductive content coding approach to identify specific information sources and key themes including news and knowledge about the outbreak, public sentiment, and public reaction to control and response measures. RESULTS: We identified 10,159 COVID-19 posts from 8703 unique Weibo users. Among our three parent classification areas, 67.22% (n=6829) included news and knowledge posts, 69.72% (n=7083) included public sentiment, and 47.87% (n=4863) included public reaction and self-reported behavior. Many of these themes were expressed concurrently in the same Weibo post. Subtopics for news and knowledge posts followed four distinct timelines and evidenced an escalation of the outbreak’s seriousness as more information became available. Public sentiment primarily focused on expressions of anxiety, though some expressions of anger and even positive sentiment were also detected. Public reaction included both protective and elevated health risk behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Between the announcement of pneumonia and respiratory illness of unknown origin in late December 2019 and the discovery of human-to-human transmission on January 20, 2020, we observed a high volume of public anxiety and confusion about COVID-19, including different reactions to the news by users, negative sentiment after being exposed to information, and public reaction that translated to self-reported behavior. These findings provide early insight into changing knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors about COVID-19, and have the potential to inform future outbreak communication, response, and policy making in China and beyond.","Xu, Qing; Shen, Ziyi; Shah, Neal; Cuomo, Raphael; Cai, Mingxiang; Brown, Matthew; Li, Jiawei; Mackey, Tim",JMIR Public Health Surveill,184,12

However, in the absence of signs of infection or at resolution thereof, inappropriately and persistently high PCT may suggest and reveal the presence of other pathologies. We report a patient with acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia in whom persistence of initially elevated PCT during recovery prompted the diagnosis of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). CASE REPORT: A 43- year-old man presented with a two-day history of fever, sneezing, sore throat and dry cough. Physical exam revealed decreased sounds and coarse crackles in both lung bases at auscultation. Medical history was positive for cognitive impairment since birth, arterial hypertension, systemic lupus erythematosus with nephritis. Initial studies included mild lymphocytopenia 650/μl (760 – 5000), D-Dimer 0.73 μg/ml (< 0.5), C reactive protein (CRP) of 62 mg/l (< 5) and PCT of 94 ng/ml (0.00 – 0.10). Positivity for SARS-Cov-2 RNA was detected and chest computerized tomography showed bilateral ground-glass opacities in the basilar lung zones and hyperdense and irregular foci in the thoracic vertebral bodies. Empirical antibiotic therapy was started and was maintained for seven days but, despite clinical improvement and the normalization of CRP, serum PCT was persistently high (84 ng/ml). Serum calcitonin (CTN) was 2120 pg/ml (normal up to 12 pg/ml). Neck ultrasound revealed inhomogeneously echogenic lymph nodes with small punctate calcifications and a non-homogeneous thyroid with multiple nodules. Cytological examination by fine needle aspiration and CTN measurement on washing liquid confirmed the suspicion of MTC. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy with bilateral cervical lymph node dissection. Histological analysis confirmed MTC of right thyroid lobe and metastasis at lymph nodes of the central right midneck area. Blood tests performed 48 hours after surgery showed a lowering of CTN (986 pg/mL) and PCT (16 ng/mL). A 6-months follow up showed persistent increased CTN and PCT levels (921 pg/ml and 16 ng/ml, respectively) while a (18)F-fluorodihydro-xyphenylalanine ((18)F-DOPA) PET did not reveal any suspicious fixations at thyroid lodge and cervical lymph node stations while multiple osteoblastic foci in the skeletal area were described. A close follow-up was planned with establishment of the results of RET gene analysis. DISCUSSION: Although CTN is the gold standard biochemical parameter for the diagnosis and follow-up of MTC, PCT can be useful as a biochemical marker of MTC suspicion in patients with inflammatory conditions and persistently elevated PCT even after resolution. In the present CASE, high levels of PCT in a patient with Covid-19 pneumonia without signs of bacterial infection, allowed to diagnose MCT. CONCLUSION: In the absence of any other signs of infection, a complete clinical assessment, including neck palpation, CTN measurement and thyroid ultrasound should be performed in the presence of persistently elevated PCT.","Laura, Gianotti; Salvatore, D’Agnano; Giorgio, Pettiti; Francesco, Tassone; Giorgio, Giraudo; Corrado, Lauro; Giuseppe, Lauria; Valerio, Del Bono; Giorgio, Borretta",AACE Clin Case Rep,184,16

The CURB-65, A-DROP and expanded CURB-65 tools are known to predict the risk of mortality in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. In this retrospective single-center retrospective study, we aimed to assess the correlations of the A-DROP, CURB-65, and expanded CURB-65 scores on admission with an increase in oxygen requirement in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 207 patients who were hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in Tokyo, Japan. Performance of A-DROP, CURB-65, and the expanded CURB-65 scores were validated. In addition, we assessed whether there were any associations between an increase in oxygen requirement and known risk factors for critical illness in COVID-19, including elevation of liver enzymes and C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocytopenia, high D-dimer levels and the chest computed tomography (CT) score. RESULTS: The areas under the curve for the ability of CURB-65, A-DROP, and the expanded CURB-65 scores to predict an increase in oxygen requirement were 0.6961, 0.6980 and 0.8327, respectively, and the differences between the three groups were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Comorbid cardiovascular disease, lymphocytopenia, elevated CRP, liver enzyme and D-dimer levels, and higher chest CT score were significantly associated with an increase in oxygen requirement CONCLUSIONS: The expanded CURB-65 score can be a better predictor of an increase in oxygen requirement in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.","Kodama, Tatsuya; Obinata, Hirofumi; Mori, Hitoshi; Murakami, Wakana; Suyama, Yohsuke; Sasaki, Hisashi; Kouzaki, Yuji; Kawano, Shuichi; Kawana, Akihiko; Mimura, Satoshi",J Infect Chemother,184,20
665110,665110,665110,A crisis is an opportunity riding a dangerous wind. (Chinese proverb),21.386953,5.953678,2020,"In response to the COVID‐19 pandemic, societies face the formidable challenge of developing sustainable forms of sociability‐cumsocial‐distancing – enduring social life while containing the virus and preventing new outbreaks. Accordant public policies often balance between retributive (punishment‐based) and assistance (solidarity‐based) measures to foster responsible behaviour. Yet, the uncontrolled spreading of the disease has divided public opinion about which measures are best suited, and it has made salient group disparities in behaviour, potentially straining intergroup relations, elevating heated emotions, and undercutting coordinated international responses. In a 2 × 2 between‐subjects experiment, British citizens (N = 377) read about national in‐group or outgroup members (categorical differentiation), who were either conforming to or deviating from the corona regulations (normative differentiation). Participants then reported moral emotions towards the target national group and indicated support for public policies. In general, support for assistance policies outweighed support for retributive measures. Second, however, norm deviation was associated with less positive and more negative moral emotions, the latter category further relating to more punitiveness and less assistance support. Finally, respondents who read about norm‐violating outgroup members especially reported support for retributive measures, indicating that people might use norm deviation to justify outgroup derogation. We discuss implications for policymakers and formulate future research avenues.","Van Assche, Jasper; Politi, Emanuele; Van Dessel, Pieter; Phalet, Karen",Br J Soc Psychol,184,24

Since its emergence, CPV-2 has been replaced with new genetic variants (CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c). Currently, information about the genotype prevalence of CPV-2 in Vietnam is limited. In the present study, we investigated the genotype prevalence and distribution of CPV-2 in the three regions of Vietnam. METHODS: Rectal swabs were collected from 260 dogs with suspected CPV-2 infection from northern, central, and southern Vietnam from November 2016 to February 2018. All samples were identified as parvovirus positive by real-time PCR, and further genotyping was performed using a SimpleProbe® real-time PCR assay. RESULTS: Of the 260 Vietnamese CPV-2 isolates, 6 isolates (2.31%) were identified as CPV-2a, 251 isolates (96.54%) were identified as CPV-2c and 3 isolates (1.15%) were untypable using the SimpleProbe® real-time PCR assay. In northern Vietnam, the percentages of CPV-2a and CPV-2c were 2.97% (3/101) and 97.3% (98/101), respectively. In central Vietnam, the percentages of CPV-2a and CPV-2c were 1.11% (1/90) and 98.89% (89/90), respectively. In southern Vietnam, the percentages of CPV-2a and CPV-2c were 3.03% (2/66) and 96.97% (64/66), respectively. CPV-2b was not observed in this study. The VP2 genes of CPV-2c in Vietnam are more genetically similar to those of CPV-2c strains in China and Taiwan than to those of prototype CPV-2c strains (FJ222821) or the first Vietnamese CPV-2c (AB120727). CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence that CPV-2c is the most prevalent variant in Vietnam. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the recent Vietnamese CPV-2c isolates share a common evolutionary origin with Asian CPV-2c strains.

But there are compelling reasons to question the assertion that we are running out. On the one hand, new technologies and discoveries have increased the supply of petroleum and natural gas. On the other, concerns about global climate change and the competitiveness of renewable energy are turning coal into a sunset industry and threaten to transform oil reserves into stranded assets. In contrast to fossil fuels, which are consumed in the process of generating energy, virtually all of the metals excavated in the past remain available even after they have been put to use. Even though the average size and degree of mineralization of recently-discovered ore bodies is on the decline, there has never been as much copper, silver, and gold available for human consumption as there is today. Whether incorporated into digital technology or infrastructure, the majority of metals remain available for recycling, which is generally less expensive, uses less energy, and has fewer environmental impacts than extracting minerals from the earth. The threat posed by climate change from continued use of fossil fuels, and the impacts of environmental degradation caused by resource extraction, demand greater attention than the misleading specter of peak oil or running out of metals.","Kirsch, Stuart",Extr Ind Soc,184,12

Twenty-nine healthy adults participated in a repeated-measures design. Each participant completed a videofluoroscopic swallow study while receiving airflow via HFNC across a control condition of zero flow and conditions of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 L/min. Five raters rated dLVC and PAS scores. Laryngeal vestibule closure was complete on all swallows. Linear regression revealed that the amount of airflow via HFNC significantly influenced dLVC, F(1, 810) = 19.056, p < .001. The mode of airway invasion for each airflow condition was PAS 2, with > 80% frequency compared to other PAS scores. Aspiration (PAS 7 or 8) did not occur. A Fisher's Exact test determined there was no association between normal/abnormal PAS score and no airflow/HFNC (p = .610). Findings indicate that for healthy adults, airflow via HFNC influenced dLVC in a dose-dependent manner with no change in airway invasion. The influence of HFNC on dLVC was a positive relationship, meaning when airflow increased, dLVC increased, and when airflow decreased, dLVC decreased. Modulation of dLVC in response to the amount of airflow highlights the ability of healthy adults to adapt to swallow conditions as needed to protect the airway.","Allen, Katie; Galek, Kristine",Dysphagia,184,1

Because only a subset of mouse primary macrophages have been identified that can support LDV replication in vitro, the precise molecular mechanism of viral entry and replication remains unclear. To analyze the LDV envelope proteins, which probably mediate viral attachment to the host cell, we developed a mammalian system for stable co-expression of LDV open reading frame (ORF) 5- and ORF 6-encoded proteins (ORF 5 and ORF 6 proteins), which correspond to envelope VP-3 and M/VP-2, respectively, and compared these expressed proteins to the native ones. Western blotting analysis combined with N-glycanase digestion revealed that ORF 5 and ORF 6 proteins were similar in size to native VP-3 and M/VP-2, and that ORF 5 protein was N-glycosylated, like the native VP-3. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that both ORF 5 and ORF 6 proteins were distributed throughout the cytoplasm and were colocalized in most cells. Moreover, ORF 5 protein was localized both in the perinuclear region and the Golgi complex and transported to the cell surface. This mammalian expression system in which the exogenously expressed proteins closely resemble the native proteins will provide the experimental basis for further studies of the interactions between LDV envelope proteins and host cells.","Takahashi-Omoe, H.; Omoe, K.; Sakaguchi, M.; Kameoka, Y.; Matsushita, S.; Inada, T.",Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,184,24

A cross-sectional study,21.369453,6.179074,2021,"Background COVID-19 patients can develop a cytokine release syndrome that eventually leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Since interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a relevant cytokine in ARDS, the blockade of its receptor with Tocilizumab (TCZ) could reduce mortality and/or morbidity in severe COVID-19. Objective To determine whether baseline IL-6 serum levels can predict the need for IMV and the response to TCZ. Methods Retrospective observational study performed in hospitalized patients diagnosed of COVID-19. Clinical information and laboratory findings, including IL-6 levels, were collected approximately 3 and 9 days after admission to be matched with pre- and post-administration of TCZ. Multivariable logistic and linear regressions, and survival analysis were performed depending on outcomes: need for IMV, evolution of arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2) or mortality. Results One hundred and forty-six patients were studied, predominantly male (66%); median age was 63 years. Forty-four patients (30%) required IMV, and 58 patients (40%) received treatment with TCZ. IL-6 levels>30 pg/ml was the best predictor for IMV (OR:7.1; p<0.001). Early administration of TCZ was associated with improvement of oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2) in patients with high IL-6 (p=0.048). Patients with high IL-6 not treated with TCZ showed high mortality (HR: 4.6; p=0.003), as well as those with low IL-6 treated with TCZ (HR: 3.6; p=0.016). No relevant serious adverse events were observed in TCZ-treated patients. Conclusion Baseline IL-6>30 pg/ml predicts IMV requirement in patients with COVID-19 and contributes to establish an adequate indication for TCZ administration.","Galván-Román, José María; Rodríguez-García, Sebastián C.; Roy-Vallejo, Emilia; Marcos-Jiménez, Ana; Sánchez-Alonso, Santiago; Fernández-Díaz, Carlos; Alcaraz-Serna, Ana; Mateu-Albero, Tamara; Rodríguez-Cortes, Pablo; Sánchez-Cerrillo, Ildefonso; Esparcia, Laura; Martínez-Fleta, Pedro; López-Sanz, Celia; Gabrie, Ligia; Guerola, Luciana del Campo; Suarez, Carmen; Ancochea, Julio; Canabal, Alfonso; Albert, Patricia; Rodríguez-Serrano, Diego A.; Aguilar, Juan Mariano; Arco, Carmen del; Santos, Ignacio de los; García-Fraile, Lucio; Camara, Rafael de la; Serra, José María; Ramírez, Esther; Alonso, Tamara; Landete, Pedro; Soriano, Joan B.; Martín-Gayo, Enrique; Torres, Arturo Fraile; Zurita Cruz, Nelly Daniela; García-Vicuña, Rosario; Cardeñoso, Laura; Sánchez-Madrid, Francisco; Alfranca, Arantzazu; Muñoz-Calleja, Cecilia; González-Álvaro, Isidoro",J Allergy Clin Immunol,184,11

We reviewed the current evidence on the transmission dynamics and on pathogenic and clinical features of COVID-19 to critically identify any gaps in the current infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines. METHODS: In this study, we reviewed global COVID-19 IPC guidelines by organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Guidelines from 2 high-income countries (Australia and United Kingdom) and from 1 middle-income country (China) were also reviewed. We searched publications in English on ‘PubMed’ and Google Scholar. We extracted information related to COVID-19 transmission dynamics, clinical presentations, and exposures that may facilitate transmission. We then compared these findings with the recommended IPC measures. RESULTS: Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare settings occurs through droplets, aerosols, and the oral–fecal or fecal–droplet route. However, the IPC guidelines fail to cover all transmission modes, and the recommendations also conflict with each other. Most guidelines recommend surgical masks for healthcare providers during routine care and N95 respirators for aerosol-generating procedures. However, recommendations regarding the type of face mask varied, and the CDC recommends cloth masks when surgical masks are unavailable. CONCLUSION: IPC strategies should consider all the possible routes of transmission and should target all patient care activities involving risk of person-to-person transmission. This review may assist international health agencies in updating their guidelines.","Islam, M.

Objective: To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma among adults hospitalized with severe and critical COVID-19. Design: Randomized, double-blind, controlled, multicenter, phase 2 trial conducted from April 21st to November 27th, 2020. Setting: Five hospitals in New York City (NY, USA) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Participants: Hospitalized patients aged [≥]18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, infiltrates on chest imaging and oxygen saturation [≤] 94% on room air or requirement for supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Intervention: Participants were randomized 2:1 to a single transfusion of either 1 unit of convalescent or normal control plasma. Measurements: The primary outcome was clinical status at 28 days, measured using an ordinal scale and analyzed using a proportional odds model in the intention-to-treat population (with an odds ratio (OR) >1.0 indicating improved clinical status in the convalescent plasma group). Results: Of 223 participants enrolled, 150 were randomized to receive convalescent plasma and 73 to normal control plasma. At 28 days, no significant improvement in clinical status was observed in participants randomized to convalescent plasma (OR 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-2.68, p=0.180). However, 28-day mortality was significantly lower in participants randomized to convalescent plasma versus control plasma (19/150 [12.6%] versus 18/73 [24.6%], OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.91, p=0.034). The median titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in infused convalescent plasma units was 1:160 (IQR 1:80-1:320). In a subset of nasopharyngeal swab samples from Brazil that underwent genomic sequencing, no evidence of neutralization-escape mutants was detected. Serious adverse events occurred in 39/147 (27%) participants who received convalescent plasma and 26/72 (36%) participants who received control plasma. Limitations: Some participants did not receive high-titer convalescent plasma. Conclusion: In adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19, use of convalescent plasma was not associated with significant improvement in 28 days clinical status. However, a significant improvement in mortality was observed, which warrants further evaluation.

This mainly affects the elderly and people with underlying diseases. People with obesity are more likely to experience unpleasant disease symptoms and increased mortality. The severe oxidative environment that occurs in obesity due to chronic inflammation permits viral activation of further inflammation leading to severe lung disease. Lifestyle affects the levels of inflammation and oxidative stress. It has been shown that a careful diet rich in antioxidants, regular exercise, and fasting regimens, each and/or together, can reduce the levels of inflammation and oxidative stress and strengthen the immune system as they lead to weight loss and activate cellular antioxidant mechanisms and reduce oxidative damage. Thus, a lifestyle change based on the three pillars: antioxidants, exercise, and fasting could act as a proactive preventative measure against the adverse effects of COVID-19 by maintaining redox balance and well-functioning immunity. Moreover, because of the observed diversity in the expression of COVID-19 inflammation, the role of genetics of innate immune molecules, surfactant protein A (SP-A)1 and SP-A2, and their differential impact on the local lung microenvironment and host defense is reviewed as genetics may play a major role in the diverse expression of the disease.","Tekos, Fotios; Skaperda, Zoi; Goutzourelas, Nikolaos; Phelps, David S.; Floros, Joanna; Kouretas, Demetrios",Antioxidants (Basel),184,29

Differences between published subspecies were supported genetically. At a local scale, populations were generally considered panmictic with minor genetic structure. Although cheetahs have persisted despite low genetic variability, important questions arise from these findings: Does the cheetah have the ability to adapt to and evolve with future changes in environmental and infectious pressure? How would cheetahs cope with further loss of genetic diversity? Connectivity in the wild should be maintained via prevention of habitat loss, while management of small isolated populations may require reestablishing gene flow.

At the same time, a variety of functional autoantibodies have been observed in individuals with severe COVID-19, where they likely contribute to immunopathology. Here, we aimed to determine the extent to which autoantibodies might target NETs in COVID-19 and, if detected, to elucidate their potential functions and clinical associations. We measured anti-NET antibodies in 328 individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 alongside 48 healthy controls. We found high anti-NET activity in the IgG and IgM fractions of 27% and 60% of patients, respectively. There was a strong correlation between anti–NET IgG and anti–NET IgM. Both anti–NET IgG and anti–NET IgM tracked with high levels of circulating NETs, impaired oxygenation efficiency, and high circulating D-dimer. Furthermore, patients who required mechanical ventilation had a greater burden of anti-NET antibodies than did those not requiring oxygen supplementation. Levels of anti–NET IgG (and, to a lesser extent, anti–NET IgM) demonstrated an inverse correlation with the efficiency of NET degradation by COVID-19 sera. Furthermore, purified IgG from COVID-19 sera with high levels of anti-NET antibodies impaired the ability of healthy control serum to degrade NETs. In summary, many individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 have anti-NET antibodies, which likely impair NET clearance and may potentiate SARS-CoV-2–mediated thromboinflammation.","Zuo, Yu; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Navaz, Sherwin A.; Hoy, Claire K.; Harbaugh, Alyssa; Gockman, Kelsey; Zuo, Melanie; Madison, Jacqueline A.; Shi, Hui; Kanthi, Yogendra; Knight, Jason S.",JCI insight,184,28

Many recommend to minimize radiation dose while maintaining diagnostic quality. This study was designed to evaluate the difference between findings of COVID-19 pneumonia on standard and low-dose protocols to provide data on the utility of the latter during initial imaging of COVID-19. METHODS Patients suspected of having COVID-19 were scanned with a 128-slices scanner using two consecutive protocols in the same session (standard-dose scan: 120 kV and 300 mA; low-dose scan: 80 kV and 40 mA). Dose data acquisition and analysis was performed using an automated software. High and low-dose examinations were anonymized, shuffled and read by two radiologist with consensus according to a highly structured reporting format that was primarily based on the consensus statement of the RSNA. Accordingly, 8 typical, 2 indeterminate, and 7 atypical findings were investigated. Cases were then assigned to one of the categories: (i) Cov19Typ, typical COVID-19; (ii) Cov19Ind, indeterminate COVID-19; (iii) Cov19Aty, atypical COVID-19; (iv) Cov19Neg, not COVID-19. McNemar test was used to analyze the number of disagreements between standard and low-dose scans regarding paired proportions of structured findings. Inter- test reliability was tested using kappa coefficient. RESULTS The study included 740 patients with a mean age of 44.05±16.59 years. The median (minimum-maximum) dose level for standard protocol was 189.98 mGy•cm (98.20-493.54 mGy•cm) and for low-dose protocol was 15.59 mGy•cm (11.59-32.37 mGy•cm) differing by -80 and -254 mGy•cm from pan-European diagnostic reference levels. Only two findings for typical, one finding for indeterminate, and three findings for atypical categories were statistically similar (p > 0.05). The difference in other categories resulted in significantly different final diagnosis for COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Overall, 626 patients received matching diagnoses with the two protocols. According to intertest reliability analysis, kappa value was found to be 0.669 (p < 0.001) to indicate substantial match. CT with standard-dose had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 72%, while CT with low-dose had a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 81%. CONCLUSION Low kV and mA scans, as used in this study according to scanner manufacturer's global recommendations, may significantly lower exposure levels. However, these scans are significantly inferior in the detection of several individual CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly the ones with GGO. Therefore, they should not be used as the protocol of choice in the initial imaging of COVID-19 patients during which higher sensitivity is required.","Karakaş, Hakkı Muammer; Yıldırım, Gülşah; Çiçek, Esin Derin",Diagnostic and interventional radiology,184,30

To determine the magnitude of the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of essential health services at all levels of care in Paraguay. METHODS. Descriptive and cross-sectional observational research. Indicators of services of the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare monitored in the country were analyzed. To compare the behavior of these indicators over time, data from the first four months (January-April) of 2017-2020 were used. To calculate the impact on each indicator, the same four-month period of 2019 and 2020 was compared, and the percentages of increase or decrease between these years were calculated. RESULTS. Since 2017, the number of visits has increased for all indicators; however, in 2020 visits related to almost all indicators have decreased to a variable degree. The most affected indicators (more than 30% decrease) were visits for digestive, hemolymphopoietic and ocular conditions. The number of visits related to the indicators control of diabetes mellitus and health control in children under 5 years increased 10.5% and 3.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. Health care related to essential services has been affected by the pandemic with a reduction of visits for non-COVID-19 causes, which should serve as an alert for the health system in order not to lose the ground gained on this front.","Tullo, Juan Edgar; Lerea, María José; López, Pedro; Alonso, Liuba",Rev Panam Salud Publica,184,26

However, the postoperative complications of this technique related to bar fixation, including wire breakage and bar displacement, are relatively high. In this study, a new minimally invasive technique for correction of PC is described, in which the pectus bar is secured by bilateral selected ribs, and for which no special fixation to the rib is needed. METHODS: The procedure was performed by placing the pectus bar subcutaneously over the sternum with both ends of the bar passing through the intercostal space of the selected rib at the anterior axillary line. The protruding sternum was depressed by the bar positioned in this 2 intra- and 2 extra-thorax manners. Between October 2011 and September 2019, 42 patients with PC underwent this procedure. RESULTS: Satisfactory cosmetic results were obtained in all the patients. The mean operation time was 87.14 min, and the mean postoperative stay was 4.05 days. Wound infection occurred in 3 patients, 2 were cured by antibiotics, and 1 received bar removal 4 months after the initial operation due to the exposure of the implant resulting from uncontrolled infection.

The prevalence is 0.001%–0.025% populations. This condition often misdiagnosed because the symptom does not appear. Acute symptoms such as abdominal pain may occur due to the obstruction of retrograde menstrual flow. In this case, we presented a case complex management of vaginal atresia with pyosalpinx, hematometra and bilateral hematosalpinx. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 12 years old teenager, non-sexually active, complained cyclic abdominal pain that worsening in seven months before admission. Patient never had menstrual blood flow during her life. Patient was diagnosed with hematometra, hematocolpos, bilateral hematosalpinx and distal vaginal agenesis. Amnion graft neovagina was performed. Five days after surgery, patient started to have fever. On the seventh days after surgery, amnion graft was removed. The next two days patient still had fever. Because of continuous fever, patient was test of COVID 19. The result was positive. On the eleventh days after the first surgery, patient complained abdominal pain VAS 3–4. Patient was diagnosed with pyosalpinx by ultrasound examination. Laparotomy was done performing adhesiolysis, bilateral salpingectomy, and omentectomy. DISCUSSION: In our case vaginal reconstruction surgery from vaginal approach has been done without management of the bilateral hematosalpinx because the consideration of small caliber of bilateral hematosalpinx. But then complications were developed when vaginal canal was opened, bilateral hematosalpinx were transformed into bilateral pyosalpinx and continue to developed into bilateral tubal abscess. We assume during this process, the bacteria from vagina could fastly infecting the blood and transformed it into pus and grew until tubal abscess. CONCLUSION: The surgical intervention in vaginal agenesis must be considered as a treatment and not only focus on the reconstruction. Laparoscopy or laparotomy may offered as options for combination treatment with vaginal approach reconstructive surgery for vaginal agenesis with obstruction complications such as hematometra and hematosalpinx to prevent the worst condition like ascending infection or misdiagnosed other severe conditions.","Moegni, Fernandi; Kouwagam, Anggrainy Dwifitriana",Int J Surg Case Rep,184,6

While the current literature has collated numerous studies on the former, strikingly, there has not been much research on the relationship between pathogen threat and in-group cooperation. Drawing upon prior studies on the function of the behavioral immune system (BIS), we argued that the BIS might facilitate cooperation with in-group members as a reactive behavioral immune response to pathogen threat. More specifically, we held that individuals might utilize cooperative behavior to ensure that they can receive social support when they have contracted an infectious disease.
