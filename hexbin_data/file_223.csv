138,Epithelial Cell Apoptosis and Neutrophil Recruitment in Acute Lung Injury—A Unifying Hypothesis? What We Have Learned from Small Interfering RNAs,2008-03-18,"In spite of protective ventilatory strategies, Acute Lung Injury (ALI) remains associated with high morbidity and mortality. One reason for the lack of therapeutic options might be that ALI is a co-morbid event associated with a diverse family of diseases and, thus, may be the result of distinct pathological processes. Among them, activated neutrophil- (PMN-) induced tissue injury and epithelial cell apoptosis mediated lung damage represent two potentially important candidate pathomechanisms that have been put forward. Several approaches have been undertaken to test these hypotheses, with substantial success in the treatment of experimental forms of ALI. With this in mind, we will summarize these two current hypotheses of ALI briefly, emphasizing the role of apoptosis in regulating PMN and/or lung epithelial cell responses. In addition, the contribution that Fas-mediated inflammation may play as a potential biological link between lung cell apoptosis and PMN recruitment will be considered, as well as the in vivo application of small interfering RNA (siRNA) as a novel approach to the inhibition of ALI and its therapeutic implications.","Perl, Mario; Lomas-Neira, Joanne; Chung, Chun-Shiang; Ayala, Alfred",Molecular Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2274893/,223
662,NNAlign: A Web-Based Prediction Method Allowing Non-Expert End-User Discovery of Sequence Motifs in Quantitative Peptide Data,2011-11-02,"Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have made it possible to generate both gene and protein sequence data at an unprecedented rate and scale thereby enabling entirely new “omics”-based approaches towards the analysis of complex biological processes. However, the amount and complexity of data that even a single experiment can produce seriously challenges researchers with limited bioinformatics expertise, who need to handle, analyze and interpret the data before it can be understood in a biological context. Thus, there is an unmet need for tools allowing non-bioinformatics users to interpret large data sets. We have recently developed a method, NNAlign, which is generally applicable to any biological problem where quantitative peptide data is available. This method efficiently identifies underlying sequence patterns by simultaneously aligning peptide sequences and identifying motifs associated with quantitative readouts. Here, we provide a web-based implementation of NNAlign allowing non-expert end-users to submit their data (optionally adjusting method parameters), and in return receive a trained method (including a visual representation of the identified motif) that subsequently can be used as prediction method and applied to unknown proteins/peptides. We have successfully applied this method to several different data sets including peptide microarray-derived sets containing more than 100,000 data points. NNAlign is available online at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NNAlign.","Andreatta, Massimo; Schafer-Nielsen, Claus; Lund, Ole; Buus, Søren; Nielsen, Morten",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3206854/,223
2715,Spread of competing viruses on heterogeneous networks,2017-06-28,"In this paper, we propose a model where two strains compete with each other at the expense of common susceptible individuals on heterogeneous networks by using pair-wise approximation closed by the probability-generating function (PGF). All of the strains obey the susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) mechanism. From a special perspective, we first study the dynamical behaviour of an SIR model closed by the PGF, and obtain the basic reproduction number via two methods. Then we build a model to study the spreading dynamics of competing viruses and discuss the conditions for the local stability of equilibria, which is different from the condition obtained by using the heterogeneous mean-field approach. Finally, we perform numerical simulations on Barabási–Albert networks to complement our theoretical research, and show some dynamical properties of the model with competing viruses.

3441,Epidemic spreading in localized environments with recurrent mobility patterns,2018-05-03,"The spreading of epidemics is very much determined by the structure of the contact network, which may be impacted by the mobility dynamics of the individuals themselves. In confined scenarios where a small, closed population spends most of its time in localized environments and has easily identifiable mobility patterns—such as workplaces, university campuses, or schools—it is of critical importance to identify the factors controlling the rate of disease spread. Here, we present a discrete-time, metapopulation-based model to describe the transmission of susceptible-infected-susceptible-like diseases that take place in confined scenarios where the mobilities of the individuals are not random but, rather, follow clear recurrent travel patterns. This model allows analytical determination of the onset of epidemics, as well as the ability to discern which contact structures are most suited to prevent the infection to spread. It thereby determines whether common prevention mechanisms, as isolation, are worth implementing in such a scenario and their expected impact.","Granell, Clara; Mucha, Peter J.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6195814/,223
3473,Use of daily Internet search query data improves real-time projections of influenza epidemics,2018-10-10,"Seasonal influenza causes millions of illnesses and tens of thousands of deaths per year in the USA alone. While the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza is substantial each year, the timing and magnitude of epidemics are highly variable which complicates efforts to anticipate demands on the healthcare system. Better methods to forecast influenza activity would help policymakers anticipate such stressors. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recognized the importance of improving influenza forecasting and hosts an annual challenge for predicting influenza-like illness (ILI) activity in the USA. The CDC data serve as the reference for ILI in the USA, but this information is aggregated by epidemiological week and reported after a one-week delay (and may be subject to correction even after this reporting lag). Therefore, there has been substantial interest in whether real-time Internet search data, such as Google, Twitter or Wikipedia could be used to improve influenza forecasting. In this study, we combine a previously developed calibration and prediction framework with an established humidity-based transmission dynamic model to forecast influenza. We then compare predictions based on only CDC ILI data with predictions that leverage the earlier availability and finer temporal resolution of Wikipedia search data. We find that both the earlier availability and the finer temporal resolution are important for increasing forecasting performance. Using daily Wikipedia search data leads to a marked improvement in prediction performance compared to weekly data especially for a three- to four-week forecasting horizon.","Zimmer, Christoph; Leuba, Sequoia I.; Yaesoubi, Reza; Cohen, Ted",J R Soc Interface,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6228485/,223
4273,Pediatric Airway Stent Designed to Facilitate Mucus Transport and Atraumatic Removal,2019-04-11,"Objective: The goal was to develop a pediatric airway stent for treating tracheobronchomalacia that could be used as an alternative to positive pressure ventilation. The design goals were for the stent to allow mucus flow and to resist migration inside the airways, while also enabling easy insertion and removal. Methods: A helical stent design, together with insertion and removal tools, is presented. A mechanics model of stent compression is derived to assist in selecting stent design parameters (pitch and wire diameter) that provide the desired amount of tracheal support, while introducing the minimal amount of foreign material into the airway. Worst-case airway area reduction with stent support is investigated experimentally using a pressurized tracheal phantom matched to porcine tracheal tissue properties. The stent design is then evaluated in a porcine in vivo experiment. Results: Phantom testing validated the mechanics model of stent compression. In vivo testing demonstrated that the stent was well tolerated by the animal. Since the helical design covers only a small portion of the epithelium, mucus transport through the stented region was minimally impeded. Furthermore, the screw-like stent resisted migration, while also providing for atraumatic removal through the use of an unscrewing motion during removal. Conclusion: The proposed stent design and tools represent a promising approach to prevent airway collapse in children with tracheobronchomalacia. Significance: The proposed technology overcomes the limitations of existing airway stents and may provide an alternative to maintaining children on a ventilator.",,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6947666/,223
5327,The Problems with Forbidding Science,2009-04-07,"Gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticle Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA probes were prepared, and their application for HBV DNA measurement was studied. Gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticles were prepared by the citrate reduction of tetra-chloroauric acid in the presence of iron oxide nanoparticles which were added as seeds. With a fluorescence-based method, the maximal surface coverage of hexaethiol 30-mer oligonucleotides and the maximal percentage of hybridization strands on gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticles were (120 ± 8) oligonucleotides per nanoparticle, and (14 ± 2%), respectively, which were comparable with those of (132 ± 10) and (22 ± 3%) in Au nanoparticle groups. Large network aggregates were formed when gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticle HBV DNA gene probe was applied to detect HBV DNA molecules as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy and the high specificity was verified by blot hybridization. Our results further suggested that detecting DNA with iron oxide nanoparticles and magnetic separator was feasible and might be an alternative effective method.","Xi, Dong; Luo, XiaoPing; Lu, QiangHua; Yao, KaiLun; Liu, ZuLi; Ning, Qin",J Nanopart Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088703/,223
5393,The bane of “inhumane” weapons and overkill: An overview of increasingly lethal arms and the inadequacy of regulatory controls,2004,"Acinar cells have been difficult to maintain in primary or secondary cultures over extended periods of time. The most successful monolayer culture system reported to date requires basement membrane substrates. We report here a technique for culture of rat parotid acinar cells which does not rely upon basement membrane supports for maintenance and growth. The procedure involves gland excision, treatment to chelate metal ions, enzymatic digestion with collagenases and hyaluronidase, removal of fat and red blood cells by gravimetric separation, and nylon mesh filtration to yield a homogeneous suspension of small aggregates and single cells. The cells were examined for: a) morphology, identity, and growth; b) macromolecular synthesis; and c) secretory output. They were healthy, peroxidase positive, and growing for up to 10 d. Protein synthesis increased from the point of cell layer formation at 3 to 4 d, through 10 d, while DNA synthesis decreased. As in other studies, amylase secretion fell sharply between 2 and 4 d in culture and remained low. Although previous studies indicated that the initial isolation protocol left these acinar cells unable to thrive in monolayer culture except in the presence of basement membrane substrates, the modified technique reported herein allows these cells to attach, spread, and grow on a wide variety of commerically available plasticware. this method lends itself readily to long-term analysis of rat parotid acinar cell metabolism without the complications of dedifferentiation, cell loss through culture manipulation common in suspension cultures, or complex interactions between bioactive supports and cell surfaces.","Kiser, Cheryl S.; Rahemtulla, Firoz; Månsson-Rahemtulla, Britta",In Vitro Cell Dev Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089145/,223

Oligonucleotides and their derivates were conjugated with the TiO(2) nanoparticles, which were obtained as colloidal solutions at a concentration of TiO(2) 0.3M by TiCl(4) hydrolysis. The electronic microscopy of various cell cultures (KCT, Vero, and MDCK) treated with nanoparticle solutions (20 µg/µl) showed that nanoparticles could enter the cells and accumulate in the vacuoles and phagosomes and form inclusions in cytoplasm. Thus, we demonstrated the penetration of TiO(2) nanoparticles and their oligonucleotide conjugates into intracellular space without any auxiliary operations.

6196,Mathematical analysis of swine influenza epidemic model with optimal control,2016-01-21,"Fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) of secondary lymphoid organs form distinct niches for interaction with hematopoietic cells. We found here that production of the cytokine IL-15 by FRCs was essential for the maintenance of group 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. Moreover, FRC-specific ablation of the innate immunological sensing adaptor MyD88 unleashed IL-15 production by FRCs during infection with an enteropathogenic virus, which led to hyperactivation of group 1 ILCs and substantially altered the differentiation of helper T cells. Accelerated clearance of virus by group 1 ILCs precipitated severe intestinal inflammatory disease with commensal dysbiosis, loss of intestinal barrier function and diminished resistance to colonization. In sum, FRCs act as an 'on-demand' immunological 'rheostat' by restraining activation of group 1 ILCs and thereby preventing immunopathological damage in the intestine.

Multiple agents are now recognized to cause indistinguishable illnesses.

Public health physicians would also get timely information on the specific etiology of the infectious syndrome, facilitating intervention at the community level in the face of outbreaks or epidemics.

7105,Controlling infectious disease outbreaks: A deterministic allocation-scheduling model with multiple discrete resources,2017-01-24,"Even though viruses evolve mainly in liquid milieu, their horizontal transmission routes often include episodes of dry environment. Along their life cycle, some insect viruses, such as viruses from the Dicistroviridae family, withstand dehydrated conditions with presently unknown consequences to their structural stability. Here, we use atomic force microscopy to monitor the structural changes of viral particles of Triatoma virus (TrV) after desiccation. Our results demonstrate that TrV capsids preserve their genome inside, conserving their height after exposure to dehydrating conditions, which is in stark contrast with other viruses that expel their genome when desiccated. Moreover, empty capsids (without genome) resulted in collapsed particles after desiccation. We also explored the role of structural ions in the dehydration process of the virions (capsid containing genome) by chelating the accessible cations from the external solvent milieu. We observed that ion suppression helps to keep the virus height upon desiccation. Our results show that under drying conditions, the genome of TrV prevents the capsid from collapsing during dehydration, while the structural ions are responsible for promoting solvent exchange through the virion wall.","Martín-González, Natalia; Guérin Darvas, Sofía M; Durana, Aritz; Marti, Gerardo A; Guérin, Diego M A; de Pablo, Pedro J",J Phys Condens Matter,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104708/,223

Using reovirus types 1 and 3, we infected 1B-6 cells (a cloned derivative of the Fisher rat cell line FRTL-5), and found a dose-dependent induction of thyroid cell MHC class II antigen expression as determined by laser flow cytometry and FITC-labelled OX-6 anti-RTl.B. As the number of viral particles/cell used for the infections increased from 5 to 100, the number of antigen positive cells increased, in reovirus type 3 infections to 50%, and in reovirus type 1 infections to 15%. Kinetic studies indicated that MHC class II antigen expression continues to increase three days after infection. Viral infection and the resulting MHC class II antigen expression may allow presentation of thyroid antigen to the immune system and participate in the initiation of autoimmune thyroid disease.","Neufeld, David S.; Platzer, Michael; Davies, Terry F.",Endocrinology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108507/,223
7569,Recovery rate affects the effective epidemic threshold with synchronous updating,2016-06-13,"Epidemic threshold has always been a very hot topic for studying epidemic dynamics on complex networks. The previous studies have provided different theoretical predictions of the epidemic threshold for the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, but the numerical verification of these theoretical predictions is still lacking. Considering that the large fluctuation of the outbreak size occurs near the epidemic threshold, we propose a novel numerical identification method of SIR epidemic threshold by analyzing the peak of the epidemic variability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that the variability measure can successfully give the numerical threshold for the SIR model. The heterogeneous mean-field prediction agrees very well with the numerical threshold, except the case that the networks are disassortative, in which the quenched mean-field prediction is relatively close to the numerical threshold. Moreover, the numerical method presented is also suitable for the susceptible-infected-susceptible model. This work helps to verify the theoretical analysis of epidemic threshold and would promote further studies on the phase transition of epidemic dynamics.","Shu, Panpan; Wang, Wei; Tang, Ming; Do, Younghae",Chaos,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112466/,223

While there are results on the asymptotic scope of the spreading dynamics, the issue of how fast an epidemic outbreak can occur remains outstanding. We observe numerically that the density of the infected nodes exhibits an exponential increase with time initially, rendering definable a characteristic time for the outbreak. We then derive a formula for scale-free networks, which relates this time to parameters characterizing the traffic dynamics and the network structure such as packet-generation rate and betweenness distribution. The validity of the formula is tested numerically. Our study indicates that increasing the average degree and/or inducing traffic congestion can slow down the spreading process significantly.","Yang, Han-Xin; Wang, Wen-Xu; Lai, Ying-Cheng",Chaos,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112479/,223

By applying spectral analysis to several constructed models, we find that one can estimate the epidemic thresholds of these networks by investigating information from only the deterministic connections. Nonetheless, in these models, generic nonuniform stochastic connections and heterogeneous community structure are also considered. The estimation of epidemic thresholds is achieved via inequalities with upper and lower bounds, which are found to be in very good agreement with numerical simulations. Since these deterministic connections are easier to detect than those stochastic connections, this work provides a feasible and effective method to estimate the epidemic thresholds in real epidemic networks.","Li, Kezan; Fu, Xinchu; Small, Michael; Zhu, Guanghu",Chaos,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112486/,223

The goal of this investigation is to examine the relationship between fluid resuscitation rate and septic shock resolution. METHOD: We retrospectively studied adult (≥ 18 years) patients with septic shock, defined based on sepsis III definition, from January 1, 2006, through May 31, 2018, in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) of Mayo Clinic Rochester. The fluid resuscitation time was defined as the time required to infuse the initial fluid bolus of 30 ml/kg, based on the recommendations of the 2016 surviving sepsis campaign. The cohort was divided into four groups based on the average fluid rate (group 1 ≥ 0.5, group 2 0.25–0.49, group 3 0.17–0.24, and group 4 < 0.17 ml/kg/min). The primary outcome was the time to shock reversal. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to account for potential confounders. RESULT: A total of 1052 patients met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. The time-to-shock reversal was significantly different among the groups (P < .001). Patients in group 1 who received fluid resuscitation at a faster rate had a shorter time to shock reversal (HR = 0.78; 95% CI 0.66–0.91; P = .01) when compared with group 4 with a median (IQR) time-to-shock reversal of 1.7 (1.5, 2.0) vs. 2.8 (2.6, 3.3) days, respectively. Using 0.25 ml/kg/min as cutoff, the higher fluid infusion rate was associated with a shorter time to shock reversal (HR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.06–1.41; P = .004) and with decreased odds of 28-day mortality (HR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.60–0.85; P < .001). CONCLUSION: In septic shock patients, initial fluid resuscitation rate of 0.25–0.50 ml/kg/min (i.e., completion of the initial 30 ml/kg IV fluid resuscitation within the first 2 h), may be associated with early shock reversal and lower 28-day mortality compared with slower rates of infusion.","Hu, Bo; Chen, Joy C.

Six strains were shown by monoclonal antibodies to differ from H120, Connecticut and Arkansas 99 strains of IBV and also to differ from each other. Four of these strains were serotyped; one (NRZ) was of the Massachusetts serotype, three (HV, NB-90 and TJ) shared a degree of antigenic similarity and were of a serotype that differed from Massachusetts and Connecticut. NB-90 was similar to both Gray and T strains whereas TJ shared some similarity with the T strain.

Clinical signs and post-mortem findings were identical to those induced by the nephropathogenic T strain. Chickens vaccinated with H120 strain, and then challenged with four highly pathogenic strains HV, NB-90, YY and TJ were not protected as determined by both virus isolation and mortality. The results show that highly pathogenic IBV strains which induce clinical nephritis occur frequently in poultry flocks in China.

9947,Design and Prototyping of a Low-Cost Portable Mechanical Ventilator,2010-06-01,"Airway transmural pressure in healthy homogeneous lungs with dilated airways is approximately equal to the difference between intraluminal and pleural pressure. However, bronchoconstriction causes airway narrowing, parenchymal distortion, dynamic hyperinflation, and the emergence of ventilation defects (VDefs) affecting transmural pressure. This study aimed to investigate the changes in transmural pressure caused by bronchoconstriction in a bronchial tree. Transmural pressures before and during bronchoconstriction were estimated using an integrative computational model of bronchoconstriction. Briefly, this model incorporates a 12-generation symmetric bronchial tree, and the Anafi and Wilson model for the individual airways of the tree. Bronchoconstriction lead to the emergence of VDefs and a relative increase in peak transmural pressures of up to 84% compared to baseline. The highest increase in peak transmural pressure occurred in a central airway outside of VDefs, and the lowest increase was 27% in an airway within VDefs illustrating the heterogeneity in peak transmural pressures within a bronchial tree. Mechanisms contributing to the increase in peak transmural pressures include increased regional ventilation and dynamic hyperinflation both leading to increased alveolar pressures compared to baseline. Pressure differences between intraluminal and alveolar pressure increased driven by the increased airway resistance and its contribution to total transmural pressure reached up to 24%. In conclusion, peak transmural pressure in lungs with VDefs during bronchoconstriction can be substantially increased compared to dilated airways in healthy homogeneous lungs and is highly heterogeneous. Further insights will depend on the experimental studies taking these conditions into account.","Winkler, Tilo",J Eng Sci Med Diagn Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164500/,223

Activity measurement included viability, phagocytosis of yeast, phagosome‐lysosome fusion, phagocytosis of opsonized particles, and superoxide release. AM were infected with 5 × 10(‐3) PFU/cell, and the comparative assessment of functions was performed at 18‐20 h postinfection. Cell viability in PRV‐infected cultures ranged from 79 to 94% of the viability in noninfected cultures. Phagocytosis of yeast was significantly reduced only in the AM cultures infected with the strain S‐62. Phagosome‐lysosome fusion was depressed in cultures infected with the strains S‐62, 4892, 3816, and BUK. The phagocytosis of opsonized sheep red blood cells showed significant differences between noninfected and PRV‐infected cultures in all cases except cultures infected with the strain PRV‐C. The O(2) release after stimulation with opsonized zymosan was significantly reduced in all the PRV‐infected cultures. The effect of PRV infection on AM functions that are related to the bacterial activity of such cells suggests that PRV‐induced AM dysfunction might have a role in the increased susceptibility of PRV‐infected pigs to bacterial pneumonia.","Iglesias, Gerardo; Pijoan, Carlos; Molitor, Thomas",J Leukoc Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166681/,223
10508,Impact of Model Shape Mismatch on Reconstruction Quality in Electrical Impedance Tomography,2012-05-22,"Influenza type A viruses are classified into subtypes based on their two surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The HA protein facilitates the viral binding and entering a host cell and the NA protein helps the release of viral progeny from the infected cell. The complementary roles of HA and NA entail their collaboration, which has important implications for viral replication and fitness. The HA protein from early strains of pandemic 2009 H1N1 of swine origin preferentially binds to human type receptors with a weak binding to avian type receptors. This virus caused several human deaths in December 2013 in Texas, USA, which motivated us to investigate the changes of genetic features that might contribute to the surged virulence of the virus. Our time series analysis on the strains of this virus collected from 2009 to 2013 implied that the HA binding preference of this virus in USA, Europe, and Asia has been the characteristic of swine H1N1 virus since 2009. However, its characteristic of seasonal human H1N1 and its binding avidity for avian type receptors both were on steady rise and had a clear increase in 2013 with American strains having the sharpest surge. The first change could enhance the viral transmission and replication in humans and the second could increase its ability to cause infection deep in lungs, which might account for the recent human deaths in Texas. In light of HA and NA coadaptation and evolutionary interactions, we also explored the NA activity of this virus to reveal the functional balance between HA and NA during the course of virus evolution. Finally we identified amino acid substitutions in HA and NA of the virus that were critical for the observed evolution.",,IEEE Trans Nanobioscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176471/,223
10591,Design and Control of a Mechatronic Tracheostomy Tube for Automated Tracheal Suctioning,2015-10-15,"Objective: To develop a compact probe that can be used to monitor humidity in ventilator care equipment. A mesoporous film of alternate layers of Poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and silica (SiO2) nanoparticles (bilayers), deposited onto an optical fibre was used. The sensing film behaves as a Fabry-Perot cavity of low-finesse where the absorption of water vapour changes the optical thickness and produces a change in reflection proportional to humidity. Methods: The mesoporous film was deposited upon the cleaved tip of an optical fibre using the layer-by-layer method. The sensor was calibrated in a bench model against a commercially available capacitive sensor. The sensitivity and response time were assessed in the range from 5 % relative humidity (RH) to 95%RH for different numbers of bilayers up to a maximum of nine. Results: The sensitivity increases with the number of bilayers deposited; sensitivity of 2.28 mV/%RH was obtained for nine bilayers. The time constant of the response was 1.13 s ± 0.30 s which is faster than the commercial device (measured as 158 s). After calibration, the optical fibre humidity sensor was utilised in a bench top study employing a mechanical ventilator. The fast response time enabled changes in humidity in individual breaths to be resolved. Conclusion: Optical fibre sensors have the potential to be used to monitor breath to breath humidity during ventilator care. Significance: Control of humidity is an essential part of critical respiratory care and the developed sensor provides a sensitive, compact and fast method of humidity monitoring.",,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7186042/,223
10683,Analysis of Benthic Communities in the Cyclades Plateau (Aegean Sea) Using Ecological and Paleoecological Data Sets,2008-06-28,"Previous studies of fetal death with maternal influenza have been inconsistent. We explored the effect of maternal influenza-like illness (ILI) in pregnancy on the risk of fetal death, distinguishing between diagnoses during regular influenza seasons and the 2009/2010 pandemic and between trimesters of ILI. We used birth records from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to identify fetal deaths after the first trimester in singleton pregnancies (2006–2013). The Norwegian Directorate of Health provided dates of clinical influenza diagnoses by primary-health-care providers, whereas dates of laboratory-confirmed influenza A (H1N1) diagnoses were provided by the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases. We obtained dates and types of influenza vaccinations from the Norwegian Immunisation Registry. Cox proportional-hazards regression models were fitted to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of fetal death, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs), comparing women with and without an ILI diagnosis in pregnancy. There were 2510 fetal deaths among 417,406 eligible pregnancies. ILI during regular seasons was not associated with increased risk of fetal death: adjusted HR = 0.90 (95% CI 0.64–1.27). In contrast, ILI during the pandemic was associated with substantially increased risk of fetal death, with an adjusted HR of 1.75 (95% CI 1.21–2.54). The risk was highest following first-trimester ILI (adjusted HR = 2.28 [95% CI 1.45–3.59]). ILI during the pandemic—but not during regular seasons—was associated with increased risk of fetal death in the second and third trimester. The estimated effect was strongest with ILI in first trimester.

10709,Monotonicity properties for a ratio of finite many gamma functions,2020-05-01,"ABSTRACT. The life cycle of Vairimorpha necatrix was studied by electron microscopy. Disporous development has two distinct stages: 1) diplokaryotic meronts which are actively mitotic, and 2) diplokaryotic sporonts which are distinguished by reduced ribosome density and a thickened plasmalemma. After final division of the sporont, sporoblasts form spores which are ovocylindrical and measure 4.4 ± 0.08 × 2.3 ± 0.05 μm (mean ± SE). Octosporous development results in eight haploid spores being formed in a sporophorous vesicle. The uninucleate octospores were smaller than the binucleate dispores and the exospore was thicker but less crenulate in outline. Early in octosporogony, tubules are produced from the sporont plasmalemma and electron‐dense material accumulates in the episporontal space. The latter may be amorphous, vesiculated, or vacuolated in appearance and in later stages may take a stacked, lamellar form. At sporoblast formation, exospore material coats the plasmalemma and attached tubules; all inclusions in the episporontal space gradually disappear as spores are formed. These secretory products may have application to taxonomic distinction at the species level.","MOORE, CLYDE B.; BROOKS, WAYNE M.",J Protozool,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7194291/,223
10883,Intervention threshold for epidemic control in susceptible-infected-recovered metapopulation models,2019-08-05,"One of the major issues in theoretical modeling of epidemic spreading is the development of methods to control the transmission of an infectious agent. Human behavior plays a fundamental role in the spreading dynamics and can be used to stop a disease from spreading or to reduce its burden, as individuals aware of the presence of a disease can take measures to reduce their exposure to contagion. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for the spread of diseases with awareness in complex networks. Unlike previous models, the information is propagated following a generalized Maki-Thompson rumor model. Flexibility on the timescale between information and disease spreading is also included. We verify that the velocity characterizing the diffusion of information awareness greatly influences the disease prevalence. We also show that a reduction in the fraction of unaware individuals does not always imply a decrease of the prevalence, as the relative timescale between disease and awareness spreading plays a crucial role in the systems' dynamics. This result is shown to be independent of the network topology. We finally calculate the epidemic threshold of our model, and show that it does not depend on the relative timescale. Our results provide a new view on how information influence disease spreading and can be used for the development of more efficient methods for disease control.","da Silva, Paulo Cesar Ventura; Velásquez-Rojas, Fátima; Connaughton, Colm; Vazquez, Federico; Moreno, Yamir; Rodrigues, Francisco A.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217501/,223

Many researchers have studied the epidemic threshold of epidemic models above which a global outbreak can occur, starting from an infinitesimal fraction of seeds. However, there have been few studies of epidemic models with finite fractions of seeds. The aim of this paper is to clarify what happens in phase transitions in such cases. The SIR model in networks exhibits two percolation transitions. We derive the percolation transition points for the SIR model with multiple seeds to show that as the infection rate increases epidemic clusters generated from each seed percolate before a single seed can induce a global outbreak.","Hasegawa, Takehisa; Nemoto, Koji",Phys Rev E,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217506/,223
10904,Effect of risk perception on epidemic spreading in temporal networks,2018-01-31,"The use of stochastic models to study the dynamics of infectious diseases is an important tool to understand the epidemiological process. For several directly transmitted diseases, reinfection is a relevant process, which can be expressed by endogenous reactivation of the pathogen or by exogenous reinfection due to direct contact with an infected individual (with smaller reinfection rate [Formula: see text] than infection rate [Formula: see text]). In this paper, we examine the stochastic susceptible, infected, recovered, infected (SIRI) model simulating the endogenous reactivation by a spontaneous reaction, while exogenous reinfection by a catalytic reaction. Analyzing the mean-field approximations of a site and pairs of sites, and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for the particular case of exogenous reinfection, we obtained continuous phase transitions involving endemic, epidemic, and no transmission phases for the simple approach; the approach of pairs is better to describe the phase transition from endemic phase (susceptible, infected, susceptible (SIS)-like model) to epidemic phase (susceptible, infected, and removed or recovered (SIR)-like model) considering the comparison with MC results; the reinfection increases the peaks of outbreaks until the system reaches endemic phase. For the particular case of endogenous reactivation, the approach of pairs leads to a continuous phase transition from endemic phase (SIS-like model) to no transmission phase. Finally, there is no phase transition when both effects are taken into account. We hope the results of this study can be generalized for the susceptible, exposed, infected, and removed or recovered ([Formula: see text]) model, for which the state exposed (infected but not infectious), describing more realistically transmitted diseases such as tuberculosis. In future work, we also intend to investigate the effect of network topology on phase transitions when the SIRI model describes both transmitted diseases ([Formula: see text]) and social contagions ([Formula: see text]).","Barros, Alessandro S.; Pinho, Suani T.

10912,Infection dynamics on spatial small-world network models,2017-11-30,"The duration of the infectious period is a crucial determinant of the ability of an infectious disease to spread. We consider an epidemic model that is network based and non-Markovian, containing classic Kermack-McKendrick, pairwise, message passing, and spatial models as special cases. For this model, we prove a monotonic relationship between the variability of the infectious period (with fixed mean) and the probability that the infection will reach any given subset of the population by any given time. For certain families of distributions, this result implies that epidemic severity is decreasing with respect to the variance of the infectious period. The striking importance of this relationship is demonstrated numerically. We then prove, with a fixed basic reproductive ratio ([Formula: see text]), a monotonic relationship between the variability of the posterior transmission probability (which is a function of the infectious period) and the probability that the infection will reach any given subset of the population by any given time. Thus again, even when [Formula: see text] is fixed, variability of the infectious period tends to dampen the epidemic. Numerical results illustrate this but indicate the relationship is weaker. We then show how our results apply to message passing, pairwise, and Kermack-McKendrick epidemic models, even when they are not exactly consistent with the stochastic dynamics. For Poissonian contact processes, and arbitrarily distributed infectious periods, we demonstrate how systems of delay differential equations and ordinary differential equations can provide upper and lower bounds, respectively, for the probability that any given individual has been infected by any given time.","Wilkinson, Robert R.; Sharkey, Kieran J.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217532/,223

By numerical and analytical arguments, we show that for symmetric and homogeneous structures [Formula: see text] where [Formula: see text] is the mean degree of both networks. Being this behavior is in marked contrast with a purely diffusive process, where the mixing time would go simply like [Formula: see text] , we identify the logarithmic slowing down in [Formula: see text] to be the result of a spontaneous mechanism of repulsion between the reactants [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] due to the interactions taking place at the networks' interface.

This fact is interpreted as an indication that these systems are operating near criticality, and, in turn, typical properties of critical dynamical processes, such as optimal information transmission and stability, are attributed to neuronal systems. The purpose of this Rapid Communication is to show that the presence of power-law distributions for the size of neuronal avalanches is not a sufficient condition for the system to operate near criticality. Specifically, we consider a simplistic model of neuronal dynamics on networks and show that the degree distribution of the underlying neuronal network may trigger power-law distributions for neuronal avalanches even when the system is not in its critical regime. To certify and explain our findings we develop an analytical approach based on percolation theory and branching processes techniques.","Faqeeh, Ali; Osat, Saeed; Radicchi, Filippo; Gleeson, James P.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217540/,223

11491,Trends in 3D Printing Processes for Biomedical Field: Opportunities and Challenges,2020-03-31,"The nature of enveloped virus-like particles (VLPs) has triggered high interest in their application to different research fields, including vaccine development. The baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) has been used as an efficient platform for obtaining large amounts of these complex nanoparticles. To date, most of the studies dealing with VLP production by recombinant baculovirus infection utilize indirect detection or quantification techniques that hinder the appropriate characterization of the process and product. Here, we propose the application of cutting-edge quantification methodologies in combination with advanced statistical designs to exploit the full potential of the High Five/BEVS as a platform to produce HIV-1 Gag VLPs. The synergies between CCI, MOI, and TOH were studied using a response surface methodology approach on four different response functions: baculovirus infection, VLP production, VLP assembly, and VLP productivity. TOH and MOI proved to be the major influencing factors in contrast with previous reported data. Interestingly, a remarkable competition between Gag VLP production and non-assembled Gag was detected. Also, the use of nanoparticle tracking analysis and flow virometry revealed the existence of remarkable quantities of extracellular vesicles. The different responses of the study were combined to determine two global optimum conditions, one aiming to maximize the VLP titer (quantity) and the second aiming to find a compromise between VLP yield and the ratio of assembled VLPs (quality). This study provides a valuable approach to optimize VLP production and demonstrates that the High Five/BEVS can support mass production of Gag VLPs and potentially other complex nanoparticles.

The refined theory explains the experience of living well with advanced cancer illuminating a five-phase iterative process: struggling, accepting, living with advanced cancer, sharing the illness experience, and reconstructing life. These five phases revolve around the core concept of Awareness of Dying, which varied from awareness of the possibility of dying, to accepting the possibility of dying, to acceptance that “I am dying.” Awareness of Dying led to a focus on living well with advanced cancer and movement towards living a life rather than living an illness.","Arantzamendi, Maria; García-Rueda, Noelia; Carvajal, Ana; Robinson, Carole A.",Qual Health Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7307002/,223

12992,Should Networks Supplant Tree Building?,2020-08-03,"INTRODUCTION: Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in patient-derived bioaerosol is a potential tool to measure source case infectiousness. However, current bioaerosol sampling approaches have reported low detection yields in sputum-positive TB cases. To increase the utility of bioaerosol sampling, we present advances in bioaerosol collection and Mtb identification that improve detection yields. METHODS: A previously described Respiratory Aerosol Sampling Chamber (RASC) protocol, or “RASC-1”, was modified to incorporate liquid collection of bioaerosol using a high-flow wet-walled cyclone (RASC-2). Individuals with GeneXpert-positive pulmonary TB were sampled pre-treatment over 60-minutes. Putative Mtb bacilli were detected in collected fluid by fluorescence microscopy utilising DMN-Trehalose. Exhaled air and bioaerosol volumes were estimated using continuous CO(2) monitoring and airborne particle counting, respectively. Mtb capture was calculated per exhaled air volume sampled and bioaerosol volume for RASC-1 (n = 35) and for RASC-2 (n = 21). Empty chamber samples were collected between patients as controls. RESULTS: The optimised RASC-2 protocol sampled a median of 258.4L (IQR: 226.9–273.6) of exhaled air per patient compared with 27.5L (IQR: 23.6–30.3) for RASC-1 (p<0.0001). Bioaerosol volume collection was estimated at 2.3nL (IQR: 1.1–3.6) for RASC-2 compared with 0.08nL (IQR: 0.05–0.10) for RASC-1 (p<0.0001). The detection yield of viable Mtb improved from 43% (median 2 CFU, range: 1–14) to 95% (median 20.5 DMN-Trehalose positive bacilli, range: 2–155). These improvements represent a lowering of the limit of detection in the RASC-2 platform to 0.9 Mtb bacilli per 100L of exhaled air from 3.3 Mtb bacilli per 100L (RASC-1). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that technical improvements in particle collection together with sensitive detection enable rapid quantitation of viable Mtb in bioaerosols of sputum positive TB cases. Increased sampling sensitivity may allow future TB transmission studies to be extended to sputum-negative and subclinical individuals, and suggests the potential utility of bioaerosol measurement for rapid intervention in other airborne infectious diseases.","Patterson, Benjamin; Dinkele, Ryan; Gessner, Sophia; Morrow, Carl; Kamariza, Mireille; Bertozzi, Carolyn R.; Kamholz, Andrew; Bryden, Wayne; Call, Charles; Warner, Digby F.; Wood, Robin",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470324/,223

At the convergence between lab-on-chip and cell biology, BoC couples in vitro three-dimensional brain-like systems to an engineered microfluidics platform designed to provide an in vivo-like extrinsic microenvironment with the aim of replicating tissue- or organ-level physiological functions. BoC therefore offers the advantage of an in vitro reproduction of brain structures that is more faithful to the native correlate than what is obtained with conventional cell culture techniques. As brain function ultimately results in the generation of electrical signals, electrophysiology techniques are paramount for studying brain activity in health and disease. However, as BoC is still in its infancy, the availability of combined BoC–electrophysiology platforms is still limited. Here, we summarize the available biological substrates for BoC, starting with a historical perspective.

Bank workers are at higher risk of hypertension because of their work sedentary characteristics. However, little is known about the prevalence and determinants of hypertension among this group of population. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of hypertension among bank employees in metropolitan cities in Amhara Regional State of Ethiopia. METHOD: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 368 bank employees. A simple random sampling technique was used to select participants. A pretested self-administered questionnaire and biophysical measurements were employed to collect the data. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses were done to summarize the data and identify factors associated with hypertension, respectively. RESULT: The overall prevalence of hypertension among bank employees was 52.4% (95% CI: 47.2, 57.7).

The more than 600 German clinics that take part in the TraumaRegistry DGU® try to obtain the declarations of consent from this special patient population. The study clinic evaluated the rate of consent and the reasons for rejection or failure to obtain consent over a 12-month period. While using a resource-intensive workflow especially for patient education and obtaining the consent, a patient consent rate of 64.5% and an error rate of 35.5% were recorded. Of the 276 potential TraumaRegistry DGU® data records 98 could not be entered and were therefore neither available for quality control nor for multiple trauma research. In order to guarantee the quality control and the further improvement of the quality of care, an approximate total recording of the patient population is necessary; however, this cannot be achieved by requiring a declaration of consent. We therefore advocate creating the possibility of collecting the TraumaRegistry data set without consent, as this ultimately represents a standard data set, comparable to the Hospital Remuneration Act (§21-KHEntgG) data set but pseudonymised.","Herbst, T.; Popp, D.; Thiedemann, C.; Alt, V.; Ernstberger, A.",Unfallchirurg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8317674/,223

For this reason, effective dietary therapies are sought that can alleviate the course of this disease. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of chemically pure oat beta-glucan preparations with different molar masses, low or high, used for 30 days in patients with histologically diagnosed chronic gastritis. The study enrolled 48 people of both genders of different ages recruited from 129 patients with a gastritis diagnosis. Before and after the therapy, hematological, biochemical, immunological and redox balance parameters were determined in the blood and the number of lactic acid bacteria and SCFA concentrations in the feces. Our results demonstrated a beneficial effect of oat beta-glucans with high molar mass in chronic gastritis in humans, resulting in reduced mucosal damage and healthy changes in SCFA fecal concentration and peripheral blood serum glutathione metabolism and antioxidant defense parameters. This fraction of a highly purified oat beta-glucan is safe for humans. Its action is effective after 30 days of use, which sheds new light on the nutritional treatment of chronic gastritis.","Gudej, Sylwia; Filip, Rafał; Harasym, Joanna; Wilczak, Jacek; Dziendzikowska, Katarzyna; Oczkowski, Michał; Jałosińska, Małgorzata; Juszczak, Małgorzata; Lange, Ewa; Gromadzka-Ostrowska, Joanna",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8400320/,223

This is a prospective, single-centre, interventional, exploratory study in a convenience sample. Clinically stable preterm infants supported with NIV-NAVA for RDS were eligible. Patients were recruited in the first 24 h after the start of NIV-NAVA. Following a predefined titration protocol, NAVA levels were progressively increased starting from a level of 0.5 cmH(2)O/µV and with increments of 0.5 cmH(2)O/µV every 3 min, up to a maximum level of 4.0 cmH(2)O/µV. We measured the evolution of peak inspiratory pressure and the electrical signal of the diaphragm (Edi) during NAVA level titration. Twelve infants with a mean (SD) gestational age at birth of 30.6 (3.5) weeks and birth weight of 1454 (667) g were enrolled. For all patients a breakpoint could be identified during the titration study. The breakpoint was on average (SD) at a level of 2.33 (0.58) cmH(2)O/µV. With increasing NAVA levels, the respiratory rate decreased significantly. No severe complications occurred. Conclusions: Preterm neonates with RDS supported with NIV-NAVA display a biphasic response to changing NAVA levels with an identifiable breakpoint. This breakpoint was at a higher NAVA level than commonly used in this clinical situation. Immature neural feedback mechanisms warrant careful monitoring of preterm infants when supported with NIV-NAVA. Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov NCT03780842.

Therefore, early detection and identification of minority viral haplotypes may help to promptly adjust the patient’s treatment plan preventing potential disease complications. Minority haplotypes can be identified using next-generation sequencing, but sequencing noise hinders accurate identification. The elimination of sequencing noise is a non-trivial task that still remains open. Here we propose CliqueSNV based on extracting pairs of statistically linked mutations from noisy reads. This effectively reduces sequencing noise and enables identifying minority haplotypes with the frequency below the sequencing error rate. We comparatively assess the performance of CliqueSNV using an in vitro mixture of nine haplotypes that were derived from the mutation profile of an existing HIV patient. We show that CliqueSNV can accurately assemble viral haplotypes with frequencies as low as 0.1% and maintains consistent performance across short and long bases sequencing platforms.","Knyazev, Sergey; Tsyvina, Viachaslau; Shankar, Anupama; Melnyk, Andrew; Artyomenko, Alexander; Malygina, Tatiana; Porozov, Yuri B; Campbell, Ellsworth M; Switzer, William M; Skums, Pavel; Mangul, Serghei; Zelikovsky, Alex",Nucleic Acids Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8464054/,223

The clinical presentation of PCD is highly non-specific since it includes infections and disorders of the upper (otitis and rhinosinusitis) and lower (neonatal respiratory distress, bronchitis, pneumonia and bronchiectasis) airways, starting in early life. Clinical examination alone does not allow a PCD diagnosis, which relies on several concordant tests, since none are sensitive or specific enough alone. Despite being the most sensitive and specific test to diagnose PCD, digital high-speed videomicroscopy (DHSV) is not sufficiently standardized, preventing its use with complete confidence as a confirmatory diagnostic test for PCD, or its inclusion in a diagnostic algorithm. Since the 2017 ERS recommendations for PCD diagnosis, three main issues remain to be solved in order to optimize DHSV ciliary beating evaluation: the problem in defining an accurate sensitivity and specificity as there is no gold standard method to diagnose all PCD cases, a lack of standardization in the operating procedure for processing respiratory samples, and in the choice of measured parameters (self-operating or not). The development of new automated analysis approaches is promising and will require full clinical validation.","Bricmont, Noemie; Alexandru, Mihaela; Louis, Bruno; Papon, Jean-François; Kempeneers, Céline",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8471803/,223
22561,Book Review,2007-02-13,"BACKGROUND: Human coronaviruses (HCoV) OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1 commonly cause upper respiratory tract infections, but can also cause severe lower respiratory tract disease. Increased use of diagnostic assays for respiratory viruses has facilitated detection and, since 2014, voluntary reporting of HCoV to the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). METHODS: We reviewed weekly aggregate test results for HCoV OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1 voluntarily reported to NREVSS by U.S. hospital and clinical laboratories from July 1, 2014‒April 30, 2017. Laboratories reporting any HCoV result using PCR were included, and the weekly percentage of positive HCoV tests by type was calculated. For a subset of HCoV detections reported to NREVSS via the Public Health laboratory Interoperability Project (PHLIP), which collects individual-level demographic data, we described age distribution and sex. Age distribution by HCoV type was compared using the Kruskal–Wallis test. RESULTS: 154 laboratories, across all 9 U.S. census divisions, reported 834,742 tests for HCoV; 18,514 (2.2%) were positive for HCoV-OC43, 8,363 (1.0%) for HCoV-NL63, 6,828 (0.8%) for HCoV-229E, and 5,170 (0.6%) for HCoV-HKU1. The percentage of tests positive for HCoV generally peaked between December and March (Figure 1). HCoV-OC43 showed distinct annual peaks with variation in magnitude by year. HCoV-HKU1 and NL63 had similar patterns, each with notable peaks during winter 2016 compared with 2015 or 2017. HCoV-229E showed a discernable peak in 2017 compared with the previous 2 years. Of 20,533 individuals with HCoV test results reported via PHLIP, 1,589 (7.7%) tested positive for any HCoV; 50% of HCoV-positive individuals were male, and the median age was 22 (range 0–96) years. Age distribution differed between HCoV types (P < 0.01, Figure 2). CONCLUSION: Over approximately 3 seasons, peak positivity for HCoV occurred during winter months, and annual differences in circulation by HCoV type were observed. Continued testing and surveillance for HCoV will allow for further characterization of circulation trends over time and by geographic region, and improved understanding of the contribution of HCoV to the winter respiratory virus season.

The risk of a disease pandemic presents an important challenge for social marketing –to this point, health-related social marketing has focused on chronic diseases (such as cancer, asthma, obesity) and their risk factors (such as tobacco use, physical inactivity, and dietary intake). In the communicable disease field, most of the challenges we have addressed have had simple and proven preventive strategies (such as immunisation and the use of condoms). However, emerging pandemic diseases pose new challenges – notably in the global scale of the threat, the rapid nature of transmission, and (often) the absence of a known cure or vaccine. In this context, people’s quality of life has scope to be shaped by immense physical and social influences. This chapter reports on a comprehensive study undertaken to inform government policy and practice in the event of an avian influenza pandemic – specifically how to prepare (but not panic) the general public.

These spiked dramatically after the Industrial Revolution, which led to the first health of cities movement that stimulated the adoption of new public health measures to improve the built-environment in the developed countries. Together with such additional factors as increasing prosperity, hygiene and especially medical advances, the old health disadvantages of cities was reversed. But a new set of medical challenges threatening to reverse previous progress has emerged. These include such problems as bacterial resistances to many of the drugs that reduced communicative diseases, to the effects of indoor living and aging, all of which require urgent attention. In addition, a review of the various health determinants that contribute to ill-health shows that since many of these factors are not within the prevue of current medical practice, they must be addressed if the health and well-being of people in cities are to be improved. A series of other problems that were previously overlooked are being tackled by the new Healthy Cities movement, such as the need for more political and citizen involvement in planning and delivering health care, better ways of promoting health rather than just curing ill-health with a new emphasis on wellness, as well as more effective measures to reduce the persistent pockets of ill-health in many cities.","Davies, Wayne K.D.",Theme Cities: Solutions for Urban Problems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121224/,223

25381,Conclusion: Ethnographic Data as Medical Evidence,2016-07-31,"Pulmonary surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins, and is synthesized and secreted by alveolar type II epithelial cells and bronchiolar Clara cells. It acts to keep alveoli from collapsing during the expiratory phase of the respiratory cycle. After its secretion, lung surfactant forms a lattice structure on the alveolar surface, known as tubular myelin. Surfactant proteins (SP)-A, B, C and D make up to 10% of the total surfactant. SP-B and SPC are relatively small hydrophobic proteins, and are involved in the reduction of surface-tension at the air-liquid interface. SP-A and SP-D, on the other hand, are large oligomeric, hydrophilic proteins that belong to the collagenous Ca(2+)-dependent C-type lectin family (known as “Collectins”), and play an important role in host defense and in the recycling and transport of lung surfactant (Awasthi 2010) (Fig. 43.1). In particular, there is increasing evidence that surfactant-associated proteins A and -D (SP-A and SP-D, respectively) contribute to the host defense against inhaled microorganisms (see 10.1007/978-3-7091-1065_24 and 10.1007/978-3-7091-1065_25). Based on their ability to recognize pathogens and to regulate the host defense, SP-A and SP-D have been recently categorized as “Secretory Pathogen Recognition Receptors”. While SP-A and SP-D were first identified in the lung; the expression of these proteins has also been observed at other mucosal surfaces, such as lacrimal glands, gastrointestinal mucosa, genitourinary epithelium and periodontal surfaces. SP-A is the most prominent among four proteins in the pulmonary surfactant-system. The expression of SP-A is complexly regulated on the transcriptional and the chromosomal level. SP-A is a major player in the pulmonary cytokine-network and moreover has been described to act in the pulmonary host defense. This chapter gives an overview on the understanding of role of SP-A and SP-D in for human pulmonary disorders and points out the importance for pathology-orientated research to further elucidate the role of these molecules in adult lung diseases. As an outlook, it will become an issue of pulmonary pathology which might provide promising perspectives for applications in research, diagnosis and therapy (Awasthi 2010).","Gupta, Anita","Animal Lectins: Form, Function and Clinical Applications",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121960/,223

This chapter examines the efficacy, or the lack thereof, of the human security paradigm in the nexus between politics and refugees. Any attempt to resolve the matter can only begin with a re-conceptualization of the entire security paradigm, including the adoption of “sustainable security,” and to perceive human security as an ethos to pave way for a more constructive political culture of reconciliation instead of recrimination.","Guan, Benny Teh Cheng",Human Security,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122314/,223
25740,Kann das Immunsystem unterwandert werden?,2009,"The products resulting for biotechnologies continue to grow at an exponential rate, and the expectations are that an even greater percentage of drug development will be in the area of the biologics. In 2011, worldwide there were over 800 new biotech drugs and treatments in development including 23 antisense, 64 cell therapy, 50 gene therapy, 300 monoclonal antibodies, 78 recombinant proteins, and 298 vaccines (PhRMA 2012). Pharmaceutical biotechnology techniques are at the core of most methodologies used today for drug discovery and development of both biologics and small molecules. While recombinant DNA technology and hybridoma techniques were the major methods utilized in pharmaceutical biotechnology through most of its historical timeline, our ever-widening understanding of human cellular function and disease processes and a wealth of additional and innovative biotechnologies have been, and will continue to be, developed in order to harvest the information found in the human genome. These technological advances will provide a better understanding of the relationship between genetics and biological function, unravel the underlying causes of disease, explore the association of genomic variation and drug response, enhance pharmaceutical research, and fuel the discovery and development of new and novel biopharmaceuticals. These revolutionary technologies and additional biotechnology-related techniques are improving the very competitive and costly process of drug development of new medicinal agents, diagnostics, and medical devices. Some of the technologies and techniques described in this chapter are both well established and commonly used applications of biotechnology producing potential therapeutic products now in development including clinical trials. New techniques are emerging at a rapid and unprecedented pace and their full impact on the future of molecular medicine has yet to be imagined.","Sindelar, Robert D.",Pharmaceutical Biotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122419/,223

The very first reverse genetic system for feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) was established in the early 2000s; the respective approach exclusively enabled the manipulation of the 3′-third of the viral genome. Later on, vaccinia virus- and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based systems have been developed. Both systems have the advantage that the entire FCoV genome is amenable for mutagenesis. The main focus of this chapter is the vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system for FCoVs. Here we present protocols for (1) the generation of a full-length cDNA clone, (2) the manipulation of the FCoV genome, and (3) the rescue of recombinant FCoVs.","Tekes, Gergely",Animal Coronaviruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122496/,223

In this paper, we hypothesise that relevance judgement, being a multidimensional, cognitive concept, can be used to probe the quantum-like structure for modelling users’ cognitive states in information seeking. Extending from an experiment protocol inspired by the Stern-Gerlach experiment in Quantum Physics, we design a crowd-sourced user study to show violation of the Kolmogorovian probability axioms as a proof of the quantum-like structure, and provide a comparison between a quantum probabilistic model and a Bayesian model for predictions of relevance.","Uprety, Sagar; Tiwari, Prayag; Dehdashti, Shahram; Fell, Lauren; Song, Dawei; Bruza, Peter; Melucci, Massimo",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148250/,223

32377,Droit et santé mentale,2020-05-11,"Online recruitment industry holds large amount of user-generated content in the form of job postings, resumes etc. This content finds its way in the knowledge bases (KB) causing duplicate and non-standard representations of entities (like company names, institute names, designations, skills etc.) These non-standard entity representations impact various applications such as search, recommendations and information retrieval. Therefore, KB canonicalization i.e, mapping multiple references of same entities into unique clusters is imperative for online recruitment platforms. Research suggests various approaches that use enriched semantic context or external context (from sources like Freebase) to perform KB Canonicalization. In fields where such external sources of context do not exist the problem remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep Siamese architecture with character-based attention and word embeddings that (a) estimates pairwise similarity between all entity mentions, and (b) then uses these similarity (scores) to create canonical clusters representing unique entity in the KB. Our experiments on recruitment domain dataset comprising of 62,288 unique entities of various types such as companies, institutes, skills, and designations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We also provide insights on different network architectures, each of which encapsulate a different set of variation while performing canonicalization.","Fatma, Nausheen; Choudhary, Vijay; Sachdeva, Niharika; Rajput, Nitendra",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206229/,223
32402,Agenda,2020-05-22,"Nowadays, great quantities of data are produced by a large and diverse family of sensors (e.g., remote sensors, biochemical sensors, wearable devices), which typically measure multiple variables over time, resulting in data streams that can be profitably organized as multivariate time-series. In practical scenarios, the speed at which such information is collected often makes the data labeling task uneasy and too expensive, so that limit the use of supervised approaches. For this reason, unsupervised and exploratory methods represent a fundamental tool to deal with the analysis of multivariate time series. In this paper we propose a deep-learning based framework for clustering multivariate time series data with varying lengths. Our framework, namely DeTSEC (Deep Time Series Embedding Clustering), includes two stages: firstly a recurrent autoencoder exploits attention and gating mechanisms to produce a preliminary embedding representation; then, a clustering refinement stage is introduced to stretch the embedding manifold towards the corresponding clusters. Experimental assessment on six real-world benchmarks coming from different domains has highlighted the effectiveness of our proposal.","Ienco, Dino; Interdonato, Roberto",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206254/,223
32413,A Novel Method for Eliminating Redundant Option Statements in the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution,2020-04-25,"Document-level RE requires reading, inferring and aggregating over multiple sentences. From our point of view, it is necessary for document-level RE to take advantage of multi-granularity inference information: entity level, sentence level and document level. Thus, how to obtain and aggregate the inference information with different granularity is challenging for document-level RE, which has not been considered by previous work. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Inference Network (HIN) to make full use of the abundant information from entity level, sentence level and document level. Translation constraint and bilinear transformation are applied to target entity pair in multiple subspaces to get entity-level inference information. Next, we model the inference between entity-level information and sentence representation to achieve sentence-level inference information. Finally, a hierarchical aggregation approach is adopted to obtain the document-level inference information. In this way, our model can effectively aggregate inference information from these three different granularities. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale DocRED dataset. We also demonstrate that using BERT representations can further substantially boost the performance.","Tang, Hengzhu; Cao, Yanan; Zhang, Zhenyu; Cao, Jiangxia; Fang, Fang; Wang, Shi; Yin, Pengfei",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206265/,223

While this is true, our analysis reveals for the first time that these relative scores have a key shortcoming: anomalies have greatly different relative scores if they are located in different regions where the curvatures of the density surface are very different. As a result, the low-score anomalies could be ranked lower than some normal points. This revelation motivates (i) a new score called Neighbourhood Contrast (NC) which produces approximately the same high scores for all anomalies, regardless of varying curvatures of the density surface in different regions; and (ii) an anomaly detection method based on NC. Our experiments show that the proposed method which employs the new score significantly outperforms methods using the aforementioned relative scores on benchmark datasets.","Chen, Bo; Ting, Kai Ming; Chin, Tat-Jun",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206296/,223
32465,Spreading Processes in Multiplex Metapopulations Containing Different Mobility Networks,2018-08-09,"Machine learning algorithms have been widely used for predicting kinase-specific phosphorylation sites. However, the scarcity of training data for specific kinases makes it difficult to train effective models for predicting their phosphorylation sites. In this paper, we propose a deep transfer learning framework, PhosTransfer, for improving kinase-specific phosphorylation site prediction. It banks on the hierarchical information encoded in the kinase classification tree (KCT) which involves four levels: kinase groups, families, subfamilies and protein kinases (PKs). With PhosTransfer, predictive models associated with tree nodes at higher levels, which are trained with more sufficient training data, can be transferred and reused as feature extractors for predictive models of tree nodes at a lower level. Out results indicate that models with deep transfer learning out-performed those without transfer learning for 73 out of 79 tested PKs. The positive effect of deep transfer learning is better demonstrated in the prediction of phosphosites for kinase nodes with less training data. These improved performances are further validated and explained by the visualisation of vector representations generated from hidden layers pre-trained at different KCT levels.

A multi-objective graph model (MOGM) is proposed to balance each DM’s objectives in both two-DM and multi-DM conflicts. To identify Nash stability in MOGMs, a comprehensive preference matrix with weight parameters on objectives is developed for each DM, along with a unilateral move matrix including preference weights (UMP). Then, considering the subjective uncertainty of DMs, interval numbers are used to represent the degree of uncertainty of preference. Subsequently, Nash equilibria and interval Nash equilibria are developed for MOGMs, and the dependence of these equilibria on weights is shown. To illustrate how MOGM can be applied in practice and provide valuable strategic insights, it is used to investigate a US-China trade dispute model. The stability results suggest potential strategic resolutions of bilateral trade disputes, and how DMs can attain them. The case analysis process suggests that a peaceful settlement of the dispute may be achievable.","An, Jingjing; Kilgour, D.

There are two key questions: (1) is the TORA suitable for explaining the intention to comply with the imposed curfews? and (2) does an extension of TORA by the variable sanction-anticipation influence the intention to obey the imposed curfews? METHODS: Using an online survey, it was investigated the individual’s intention, attitudes and subjective norm to follow the restrictions, and also the anticipation of sanctions for noncompliance using a rating scale (1–7). Multiple linear regression and hierarchical regression analysis were used to clarify key questions. RESULTS: In all, 1269 evaluable records demonstrated that the intention to follow the curfews is high (mean 6.24, standard deviation 1.2) and that this can be elucidated through the attitudes and subjective norm to 67% (p < 0.001). There is no impact of impending sanctions for noncompliance (∆R(2) = 0.002). DISCUSSION: The TORA is suitable for explaining the intention to comply with the curfews. Key political decision-makers should avoid threatening sanctions during speeches to increase compliance but instead emphasize the meaning and benefit of the measures for society and also for the individual’s own social environment in order to positively influence the intended goals.","Schillings, Johannes; Mohr, Mara; Mohren, Jessica",Pr&#x000e4;v Gesundheitsf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7250259/,223
33124,People & Appointments,2020-05-14,"Objective of the current study was to assess whether game-formatted executive function (EF) training, is effective in improving attention, EF and academic performance in very preterm and/or extremely low birthweight children aged 8–12 years. A multi-center, double-blind, placebo- and waitlist controlled randomized trial (NTR5365) in two academic hospitals in The Netherlands was performed. Eighty-five very preterm children with parent-rated attention problems on the Child Behavior Checklist were randomized to one of three treatment conditions: EF training, placebo training or waitlist condition. EF or placebo training was completed at home (6 weeks, 25 sessions of 30–45 min each). At baseline, 2 weeks after training or being on the waitlist, and five months after first follow-up visit, children underwent assessments of primary outcomes (parent and teacher ratings of attention) and secondary outcomes (parent and teacher ratings of daily-life EF, computerized EF tasks and academic performance). Linear mixed model analyses were performed for all outcome measures. There were no significant differences in improvement over time on parent- and teacher ratings of attention, parent- and teacher ratings of daily-life EF, computerized EF tasks, and academic performance (arithmetic and reading) between the EF training, placebo training and waitlist condition. In conclusion, game-formatted EF training does not improve attention, EF or academic performance in very preterm children with parent-rated attention problems.

Modern blockchains support smart contracts, i.e., software deployed on the blockchain, and guarantee their repeatable, deterministic execution. Alas, blockchains and smart contracts lack standardization. Therefore, smart contracts come with heterogeneous properties, APIs and data formats. This hinders the integration of smart contracts running in different blockchains, e.g., into enterprise business processes. This paper introduces the Smart Contract Invocation Protocol (SCIP), which unifies interacting with smart contracts of different blockchains. The protocol supports invoking smart contract functions, monitoring function executions, emitted events, and transaction finality, as well as querying a blockchain. The protocol is accompanied by a prototypical implementation of a SCIP endpoint in the form of a gateway.","Falazi, Ghareeb; Breitenbücher, Uwe; Daniel, Florian; Lamparelli, Andrea; Leymann, Frank; Yussupov, Vladimir",Advanced Information Systems Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266466/,223

However, transparency is not automatically achieved when FIS are estimated from data, thus researchers are actively investigating methods to design interpretable FIS. Following this line of research, we propose a new approach for FIS simplification which leverages graph theory to identify and remove similar fuzzy sets from rule bases. We test our methodology on two data sets to show how this approach can be used to simplify the rule base without sacrificing accuracy.","Fuchs, Caro; Spolaor, Simone; Nobile, Marco S.; Kaymak, Uzay",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274303/,223
34355,Het nieuwe normaal,2020-06-26,"One of the key coordination problems in physically-deployed distributed systems, such as mobile robots, wireless sensor networks, and IoT systems in general, is to provide notions of “distributed sensing” achieved by the strict, continuous cooperation and interaction among individual devices. An archetypal operation of distributed sensing is data summarisation over a region of space, by which several higher-level problems can be addressed: counting items, measuring space, averaging environmental values, and so on. A typical coordination strategy to perform data summarisation in a peer-to-peer scenario, where devices can communicate only with a neighbourhood, is to progressively accumulate information towards one or more collector devices, though this typically exhibits problems of reactivity and fragility, especially in scenarios featuring high mobility. In this paper, we propose coordination strategies for data summarisation involving both idempotent and arithmetic aggregation operators, with the idea of controlling the minimum information propagation speed, so as to improve the reactivity to input changes. Given suitable assumptions on the network model, and under the restriction of no data loss, these algorithms achieve optimal reactivity. By empirical evaluation via simulation, accounting for various sources of volatility, and comparing to other existing implementations of data summarisation algorithms, we show that our algorithms are able to retain adequate accuracy even in high-variability scenarios where all other algorithms are significantly diverging from correct estimations.","Audrito, Giorgio; Bergamini, Sergio; Damiani, Ferruccio; Viroli, Mirko",Coordination Models and Languages,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7282839/,223

The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a member of the Coronaviridae family. Though the pulmonary involvement is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and pancreas has been explained in these patients. The literature is rapidly changing because of influx of new information with every passage of time. The most common hepatic presentation is mild elevation of aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase, which does not require specific treatment. Occasionally, patients can have severe liver injury. Because of underlying predisposing factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity, patients with nonalcoholic liver disease may be at risk of severe disease. Patients with decompensated liver disease may also be vulnerable to severe disease. Behavior of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C, autoimmune hepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis is yet to be seen. The prevalence and severity of COVID-19 patients with the aforementioned diseases may be different. The effect of SARS-CoV-2 on an underlying liver disease is not known. COVID-19 may complicate the peritransplant period and throw new challenges in these patients. Drugs used to treat severe COVID-19 may cause liver injury and may have an effect on the underlying disease activity. Both hepatic and pancreatic involvement is related to the severity of COVID-19 disease. Serum amylase and lipase levels may be elevated in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. The involvement of pancreatic islet cells may lead to deranged blood sugar levels and potentially predispose to future diabetes mellitus. There are many unknown facts that will unfold with the passage of time.","Singla, Vikas; Arora, Anil",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7295265/,223
35096,Sefficiency (Sustainable Efficiency),2020-06-21,"In clinical practice, normal values or reference intervals are the main point of reference for interpreting a wide array of measurements, including biochemical laboratory tests, anthropometrical measurements, physiological or physical ability tests. They are historically defined to separate a healthy population from unhealthy and therefore serve a diagnostic purpose. Numerous cross-sectional studies use various classical parametric and nonparametric approaches to calculate reference intervals. Based on a large cross-sectional study (N = 60,799), we compute reference intervals for subpopulations (e.g. males and females) which illustrate that subpopulations may have their own specific and more narrow reference intervals. We further argue that each healthy subject may actually have its own reference interval (subject-specific reference intervals or SSRIs). However, for estimating such SSRIs longitudinal data are required, for which the traditional reference interval estimating methods cannot be used. In this study, a linear quantile mixed model (LQMM) is proposed for estimating SSRIs from longitudinal data. The SSRIs can help clinicians to give a more accurate diagnosis as they provide an interval for each individual patient. We conclude that it is worthwhile to develop a dedicated methodology to bring the idea of subject-specific reference intervals to the preventive healthcare landscape.","Pusparum, Murih; Ertaylan, Gökhan; Thas, Olivier",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7303731/,223

Sepsis-3 was established to improve risk stratification among patients with infection based on organ failures, but it has been still controversial compared with previous definitions. Therefore, we aimed to describe characteristics of patients who met sepsis-2 (severe sepsis) and sepsis-3 definitions. METHODS: This was a multicenter, prospective cohort study conducted by 22 intensive care units (ICUs) in Japan. Adult patients (≥ 16 years) with newly suspected infection from December 2017 to May 2018 were included. Those without infection at final diagnosis were excluded. Patient’s characteristics and outcomes were described according to whether they met each definition or not. RESULTS: In total, 618 patients with suspected infection were admitted to 22 ICUs during the study, of whom 530 (85.8%) met the sepsis-2 definition and 569 (92.1%) met the sepsis-3 definition. The two groups comprised different individuals, and 501 (81.1%) patients met both definitions. In-hospital mortality of study population was 19.1%. In-hospital mortality among patients with sepsis-2 and sepsis-3 patients was comparable (21.7% and 19.8%, respectively). Patients exclusively identified with sepsis-2 or sepsis-3 had a lower mortality (17.2% vs. 4.4%, respectively). No patients died if they did not meet any definitions. Patients who met sepsis-3 shock definition had higher in-hospital mortality than those who met sepsis-2 shock definition. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with infection admitted to ICU meet sepsis-2 and sepsis-3 criteria. However, in-hospital mortality did not occur if patients did not meet any criteria. Better criteria might be developed by better selection and combination of elements in both definitions.

In the case of severe traffic congestion, the vehicle speed is very slow, which results in the GPS positioning system’s estimation of the vehicle speed being very inaccurate, which in turn leads to poor reliability of the estimated congestion time of the road segment. The main contents of this study are: in the case of urban traffic congestion, the prediction and analysis of the degree of traffic congestion and the length of congestion. Taking the dynamic traffic data of Shenzhen on June 9, 2014 as an example, the road section of Binhe Avenue is selected, and the data of traffic flow, average speed of traffic volume and traffic volume density in the current time period are calculated after data preprocessing, as a measure of traffic. The main impact indicators of congestion status. Then we use the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method to divide TSI as a traffic congestion evaluation index and divide the road congestion into four levels. In this way, we can get the congestion of the road in each time period of the day and the time required to pass. Then we use the random forest, adaboost, GBDT, Lasso CV and BP neural networks in the machine learning algorithm to build models to measure traffic congestion for training and testing. Finally, the BP neural network has the best effect on this problem, and mean square error is 0.0190. Finally, we used BP neural network to predict and congest the road in the next three hours. From the experimental simulation results, this method can effectively analyze and predict the real-time traffic congestion.","Mei, Yuan; Hu, Ting; Yang, Li Chun",Data Mining and Big Data,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7351684/,223

Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has made significant progress on single-agent problems. However, multi-agent problems still cannot be easily solved by traditional RL algorithms. First, the multi-agent environment is considered as a non-stationary system. Second, most multi-agent environments only provide a shared team reward as feedback. As a result, agents may not be able to learn proper cooperative or competitive behaviors by traditional RL. Our algorithm adopts Evolution Strategies (ES) for optimizing policy which is used to control agents and a value decomposition method for estimating proper fitness for each policy. Evolutionary Algorithm is considered as a promising alternative for signal-agent problems. Owing to its simplicity, scalability, and efficiency on zeroth-order optimization, EAs can even outperform RLs on some tasks. In order to solve multi-agent problems by EA, a value decomposition method is used to decompose the team reward. Our method is parallel on multiple cores, which can speed up our algorithm significantly. We test our algorithm on two benchmarking environments, and the experiment results show that our algorithm is better than traditional RL and other representative gradient-free methods.","Li, Gao; Duan, Qiqi; Shi, Yuhui",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354799/,223

On 1 April 2019, the Act on Improvement of the Cooperation and the Structural Framework for Organ Donation came into force. This Act strengthens the role of the transplant coordinators in the harvesting hospitals and establishes adequate reimbursement of the organ donation-related costs in the harvesting hospitals. Furthermore, it fosters the cooperation of the transplant coordinators with the German organ procurement organization. On 16 January 2020, the existing opt-in legislation was modified. While the general principle of the opt-in legislation stayed unchanged, different measures were introduced that aim to repeatedly inform all citizens about organ donation and thereby motivate them to make a decision on organ donation.

Additionally, the molecular classification of CRC has led to the identification of different immune microenvironments linked to distinct prognosis and therapeutic response. However, the association between tumor budding and the different molecular subtypes of CRC and distinct immune profiles have not been fully elucidated. This study focused, firstly, on the validation of derived xenograft models (PDXs) for the evaluation of tumor budding and their human counterparts and, secondly, on the association between tumor budding and the immune tumor microenvironment by the analysis of gene expression signatures of immune checkpoints, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and chemokine families. Clinical CRC samples with different grades of tumor budding and their corresponding PDXs were included in this study. Tumor budding grade was reliably reproduced in early passages of PDXs, and high-grade tumor budding was intimately related with a poor-prognosis CMS4 mesenchymal subtype. In addition, an upregulation of negative regulatory immune checkpoints (PDL1, TIM-3, NOX2, and IDO1), TLRs (TLR1, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR6), and chemokine receptors and ligands (CXCR2, CXCR4, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL6, and CXCL9) was detected in high-grade tumor budding in both human samples and their corresponding xenografts. Our data support a close link between high-grade tumor budding in CRC and a distinctive immune-suppressive microenvironment promoting tumor invasion, which may have a determinant role in the poor prognosis of the CMS4 mesenchymal subtype.

37527,Kindness Should Still Underline Science During the Pandemic,2020-07-13,"Enveloped viruses such as SAR-CoV-2 are sensitive to heat and are destroyed by temperatures tolerable to humans. All mammals use fever to deal with infections and heat has been used throughout human history in the form of hot springs, saunas, hammams, steam-rooms, sweat-lodges, steam inhalations, hot mud and poultices to prevent and treat respiratory infections and enhance health and wellbeing. This paper reviews the evidence for using heat to treat and prevent viral infections and discusses potential cellular, physiological and psychological mechanisms of action. In the initial phase of infection, heat applied to the upper airways can support the immune system’s first line of defence by supporting muco-ciliary clearance and inhibiting or deactivating virions where they first lodge. This may be further enhanced by the inhalation of steam containing essential oils with anti-viral, mucolytic and anxiolytic properties. Heat applied to the whole body can further support the immune system’s second line of defence by mimicking fever and activating innate and acquired immune defences and building physiological resilience. Heat-based treatments also offer psychological benefits and enhanced mental wellness by focusing attention on positive action, enhancing relaxation and sleep, inducing 'forced-mindfulness', and invoking the power of positive thinking and ‘remembered wellness’. Heat is a cheap, convenient and widely accessible therapeutic modality and while no clinical protocols exist for using heat to treat COVID-19, protocols that draw from traditional practices and consider contraindications, adverse effects and infection control measures could be developed and implemented rapidly and inexpensively on a wide scale. While there are significant challenges in implementing heat-based therapies during the current pandemic, these therapies present an opportunity to integrate natural medicine, conventional medicine and traditional wellness practices, and support the wellbeing of both patients and medical staff, while building community resilience and reducing the likelihood and impact of future pandemics.","Cohen, Marc",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7372531/,223

This article looks at the potential impact of COVID‐19 on student learning as schools abruptly morphed into virtual learning environments using data from several instructional, practice, and assessment solutions offered by Renaissance. First, three hypothetical learning scenarios are considered using normative data from Star assessments to explore the potential impact on reading and math test performace. Next, data on Focus Skills are used to highlight which grades may have missed the most foundational math and reading content if instruction was stopped or reduced. Last, data from two of Renaissance's practice tools are used to evaluate whether students were practicing key skills following school closures. The article concludes that academic decline will likely occur but may be tempered by the increased use of practice tools; effects may look different for math and reading; and may impact grades and schools differently.

We sought to determine the relationship between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and mortality in the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) patients with CS. METHODS: Using a single-center database of CICU patients admitted between 2007 and 2015, we identified patients with an admission diagnosis of CS. MAP was measured every 15 min, and the mean of all MAP values during the first 24 h (mMAP(24)) was recorded. Multivariable logistic regression determined the relationship between mMAP(24) and adjusted hospital mortality. RESULTS: We included 1002 patients with a mean age of 68 ± 13.7 years, including 36% females. Admission diagnoses included acute coronary syndrome in 60%, heart failure in 74%, and cardiac arrest in 38%. Vasoactive drugs were used in 72%. The mMAP(24) was higher (75 vs. 71 mmHg, p < 0.001) among hospital survivors (66%) compared with non-survivors (34%). Hospital mortality was inversely associated with mMAP(24) (adjusted OR 0.9 per 5 mmHg higher mMAP(24), p = 0.01), with a stepwise increase in hospital mortality at lower mMAP(24). Patients with mMAP(24) < 65 mmHg were at higher risk of hospital mortality (57% vs. 28%, adjusted OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4–3.0, p < 0.001); no differences were observed between patients with mMAP(24) 65–74 vs. ≥ 75 mmHg (p > 0.1).

39021,"Leitlinie: Neurogene Darmfunktionsstörung bei Querschnittlähmung (Langfassung): Entwicklungsstufe: S2k, AWMF-Register-Nr.: 179-004",2020-09-11,"BACKGROUND: The active metabolite of vitamin D, calcitriol, has been shown across many different species to augment innate immune responses and dampen aberrant proinflammatory cytokine production. Community acquired infections are common in shelters and consume limited shelter resources, impact adoption rates, and can result in unnecessary euthanasia. Prophylactic oral vitamin D supplementation decreases the incidence and severity of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in humans. Before a clinical trial investigating the clinical benefit of oral vitamin D supplementation in shelter dogs can be pursued, an in vitro study evaluating the immunomodulatory effects of calcitriol in blood from shelter dogs is warranted. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine if incubation of whole blood obtained from apparently healthy dogs housed in a shelter for ≥7 days with calcitriol would alter granulocyte/monocyte (GM) oxidative burst and phagocytic function as well as pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-stimulated leukocyte production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10. RESULTS: Ten dogs housed in a shelter for ≥7 days were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Whole blood from these dogs was incubated with calcitriol (10(− 7) M) or diluent (control) for 24 h. Subsequent to this incubation, phagocytosis of opsonized-Escherichia coli (E. coli) and E. coli-induced oxidative burst were evaluated via flow cytometry. In addition, leukocyte production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 were measured using a canine-specific multiplex bead assay. Calcitriol significantly decreased leukocyte TNF-α production (p = 0.009) and increased IL-10 production (p = 0.002). Tumor necrosis factor-α-to-IL-10 ratio was significantly decreased with calcitriol (p = 0.017), while IL-6 production as well as GM oxidative burst and phagocytic function were not significantly affected. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that calcitriol attenuates proinflammatory immune responses without affecting GM oxidative burst or phagocytic function in vitro in whole blood obtained from apparently healthy shelter dogs.","Jaffey, Jared A.; Bessette, Mariah; Tao, Zenan; Bradley-Siemens, Nancy; Thompson, Melissa",Canine Med Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7477847/,223

The correctness of such analyses usually depends both on domain-specific properties and change impact analysis, and is rarely established formally, which is detrimental to trustworthiness. We present a formalization of change impact analysis with machine-checked proofs of correctness in the Coq proof assistant. Our formal model factors out domain-specific concerns and captures system components and their interrelations in terms of dependency graphs. Using compositionality, we also capture hierarchical impact analysis formally for the first time, which, e.g., can capture when impacted files are used to locate impacted tests inside those files. We refined our verified impact analysis for performance, extracted it to efficient executable OCaml code, and integrated it with a regression test selection tool, one regression proof selection tool, and one build system, replacing their existing impact analyses. We then evaluated the resulting toolchains on several open source projects, and our results show that the toolchains run with only small differences compared to the original running time. We believe our formalization can provide a basis for formally proving domain-specific techniques using change impact analysis correct, and our verified code can be integrated with additional tools to increase their reliability.","Palmskog, Karl; Celik, Ahmet; Gligoric, Milos",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7480691/,223

39783,NSLPCD: Topic based tweets clustering using Node significance based label propagation community detection algorithm,2020-09-24,"During pregnancy, various immune effectors and molecules participating in the immune-microenvironment establish specific maternal tolerance toward the semi-allogeneic fetus. Activated maternal immune effectors by the trophoblast antigens, such as T helper (Th), T cytotoxic (Tc), T regulatory (Treg), and B cells, are involved in the regulation of adaptive immunity. Recognition of active signal through the T cell receptors stimulate the differentiation of naive CD3(+)CD4(+) T cells into specific T cell subsets, such as Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, Th22, and follicular Th cells (Tfh). Each of these subsets has a significant and distinct role in human pregnancy. Th1 immunity, characterized by immune-inflammatory responses, becomes dominant during the peri-implantation period, and the “controlled” Th1 immunity benefits the invading trophoblasts rather than harm. Quickly after the placental implantation, the early inflammatory Th1 immunity is shifted to the Th2 anti-inflammatory immune responses. The predominant Th2 immunity, which overrules the Th1 immunity at the placental implantation site, protects a fetus by balancing Th1 immunity and accommodate fetal and placental development. Moreover, Treg and Th9 cells regulate local inflammatory immune responses, potentially detrimental to the fetus. Th17 cells induce protective immunity against extracellular microbes during pregnancy. However, excessive Th17 immunity may induce uncontrolled neutrophil infiltration at the maternal-fetal interface. Other Th cell subsets such as Tfh cells, also contribute to pregnancy by setting up favorable humoral immunity during pregnancy. However, dysregulation of Th cell immunity during pregnancy may result in obstetrical complications, such as recurrent pregnancy losses (RPL) and preeclampsia (PE). With this review, we intend to deliver a comprehensive overview of CD4(+) Th cell subsets, including Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, Th22, and Tfh cells, in human pregnancy by reviewing their roles in normal and pathological pregnancies.","Wang, Wenjuan; Sung, Nayoung; Gilman-Sachs, Alice; Kwak-Kim, Joanne",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7461801/,223

40451,To Fight a New Coronavirus: Special Section of Letters and a Comment,2020-09-11,"The trade war between the USA and China has shocked many across the world. A disruption to the interdependence of the two largest economies seemed unfathomable. However, in an effort to thwart China’s economic practices and boost the US economy, President Trump’s administration levied tariffs on Chinese imports shortly after taking office, moving US foreign economic policy from liberalism, practiced for decades, to protectionism. China has retaliated, and the trade war continues today. With conceptual insights from the nationalism literature, we explore the nationalist roots of the trade war from both the US and Chinese perspectives. In the USA, the Trump administration’s plan to achieve energy autonomy, decrease reliance on foreign resources, and reinvigorate the manufacturing sector has led to protectionist policies, the othering of China, and hence the trade war. Although reluctant to enter the conflict, China has rebuffed the USA, resisting and counterattacking US actions, owing to a long-felt sense of persecution in the global space and an eagerness to participate fully, and lead in some issue areas, in international affairs. The conflict continues into the COVID-19 era, marked by US scapegoating of China and hits to economic performance. Until both sides are convinced they have achieved their goals, or the USA undergoes an administration change, the conflict will likely continue.","Boylan, Brandon M.; McBeath, Jerry; Wang, Bo",Fudan J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7533044/,223
40603,Barbara Stoll: China Medical Board's charismatic new President,2020-10-08,"In agricultural and agrifood systems, like in many other economic sectors, the main innovation drivers have traditionally been (1) technological advances and (2) research and development. When innovation fails to address the actual needs of clients and end-users, however, satisfaction gaps are created. The result is that investors receive insufficient returns and end-users receive less than expected value. The consequences of failure can be deeper than just financial, however. Successful innovation in agriculture and agrifood systems is critical to secure affordable, nutritious, and safe food for all people. Rapid innovation is needed to address the serious challenge of climate change and to reduce agriculture’s global environmental footprint. The overarching goal of agricultural innovation should be to deliver high value to end-users and improve their quality of life and well-being. To achieve this goal, organizations must first understand the jobs to be done concept for their end-users. They must take into account user satisfaction gaps and frustrations. Understanding user needs is as important as producing technology to finding innovative solutions. This is true around the globe; in industry and public sectors, and in both developed and developing countries. This chapter explains why investing in innovation is very different from succeeding at it. Ultimately, the examples, ideas, and guidelines in this chapter can be brought to bear on agricultural innovation efforts (and any other economic sector), to make them more productive and worthwhile for end-users and investors/funders. The information herein is meant to increase the likelihood of successful innovation efforts at both profit-seeking firms and nonprofit organizations.","Campos, Hugo",The Innovation Revolution in Agriculture,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7540614/,223
40665,Ein Vogel braucht zwei Flügel,2020-10-16,"BACKGROUND: Public health agencies had to respond swiftly to the novel coronavirus that emerged in 2019 (COVID-19) to try to contain the virus, which requires early identification of new cases. Monitoring exposed individuals is labor intensive and available tools are often limited. MITRE, a company that operates federally funded research and development centers for the U.S. government, rapidly developed a configurable monitoring tool that allows public health authorities to monitor potentially exposed individuals in their jurisdictions. METHODS: A team, including public health leaders, field epidemiologists, software engineers, and health communication specialists, was quickly assembled to design and develop an open source, disease-independent monitoring tool called Sara Alert. Outreach to key public health stakeholders, including partner organizations and local and state health departments, was conducted early for requirements gathering and to validate assumptions. Public health law experts were consulted regarding data privacy and security. RESULTS: By four weeks, a minimally viable monitoring tool was available for testing by public health partners. Exposed individuals can be enrolled and reminded daily to enter a temperature and any symptoms by web or mobile interface, SMS messaging or phone. Public health officials monitor and can quickly take action if symptoms consistent with COVID-19 are reported of if there is failure to report within a configurable time frame. Dashboards provide insight into aggregated data appropriate to level of view. CONCLUSIONS: Sara Alert serves as a force multiplier that supports disease containment and allows resources to be directed where they are most needed. Successful development was possible because key stakeholders across public health practice were consulted early. Sara Alert is available, free, to state and local public health departments and serves as an enduring resource easily configured for the next public health emergency. KEY MESSAGES: Sara Alert serves as a force multiplier that supports disease containment and allows resources to be directed where they are most needed.

41265,Letter from the Editor-in-Chief,2020-10-27,"Solubility of recombinant proteins (i.e., the extent of soluble versus insoluble expression in heterogeneous hosts) is the first checkpoint criterion for determining recombinant protein quality. However, even soluble proteins often fail to represent functional activity because of the involvement of non-functional, misfolded, soluble aggregates, which compromise recombinant protein quality. Therefore, screening of solubility and folding competence is crucial for improving the quality of recombinant proteins, especially for therapeutic applications. The issue is often highlighted especially in bacterial recombinant hosts, since bacterial cytoplasm does not provide an optimal environment for the folding of target proteins of mammalian origin. Antibody fragments, such as single-chain variable fragment (scFv), single-chain antibody (scAb), and fragment antigen binding (Fab), have been utilized for numerous applications such as diagnostics, research reagents, or therapeutics. Antibody fragments can be efficiently expressed in microorganisms so that they offer several advantages for diagnostic applications such as low cost and high yield. However, scFv and scAb fragments have generally lower stability to thermal stress than full-length antibodies, necessitating a judicious combination of designer antibodies, and bacterial hosts harnessed with robust chaperone function. In this review, we discuss efforts on not only the production of antibodies or antibody fragments in microorganisms but also scFv stabilization via (i) directed evolution of variants with increased stability using display systems, (ii) stabilization of the interface between variable regions of heavy (V(H)) and light (V(L)) chains through the introduction of a non-native covalent bond between the two chains, (iii) rational engineering of V(H)-V(L) pair, based on the structure, and (iv) computational approaches. We also review recent advances in stability design, increase in avidity by multimerization, and maintaining the functional competence of chimeric proteins prompted by various types of chaperones.","Kang, Tae Hyun; Seong, Baik Lin",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7546209/,223

In light of the stark reality, this study unravels the political economy and multidimensional factors of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria using the daily data spanning 27th of February through 26th of May, 2020. This paper deploys a variety of count data estimators to estimate the effects of political economy and ethno-religious factors on COVID-19 cases in Nigeria. The parameter estimates reveal that the odds of the Hausa ethnic group in human-to-human transmission of the virus, to be in the “Certain Zero” group is relatively less as compared to other ethnic groups in the country. A plausible reason, particularly for the vulnerable group can be attributed, in part, to their low levels of educational attainment as well as their staunch religious belief with respect to the act of soul taking as being the exclusive property of the creator than the created. Thus, addressing ethno-religious concerns together with socioeconomic factors remain the formidable mitigation policy choices to combating the scourge of the global virus of COVID-19.","Ajide, Kazeem Bello; Alimi, Olorunfemi Yasiru; Ibrahim, Ridwan Lanre; Nwokolo, Ifeoma Chinenye",J Econ Race Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7649302/,223

A direct causative relationship between Patient–ventilator asynchrony and adverse clinical outcome have yet to be demonstrated. It is hypothesized that during trigger errors excessive pleural pressure swings are generated, contributing to increased work-of-breathing and self-inflicted lung injury. The objective of this study was to determine the additional work-of-breathing and pleural pressure swings caused by trigger errors in mechanically ventilated children. METHODS: Prospective observational study in a tertiary paediatric intensive care unit in an university hospital. Patients ventilated > 24 h and < 18 years old were studied. Patients underwent a 5-min recording of the ventilator flow–time, pressure–time and oesophageal pressure–time scalar. Pressure–time–product calculations were made as a proxy for work-of-breathing. Oesophageal pressure swings, as a surrogate for pleural pressure swings, during trigger errors were determined. RESULTS: Nine-hundred-and-fifty-nine trigger errors in 28 patients were identified. The additional work-of-breathing caused by trigger errors showed great variability among patients. The more asynchronous breaths were present the higher the work-of-breathing of these breaths. A higher spontaneous breath rate led to a lower amount of trigger errors. Patient–ventilator asynchrony was not associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation or paediatric intensive care stay. CONCLUSIONS: The additional work-of-breathing caused by trigger errors in ventilated children can take up to 30–40% of the total work-of-breathing. Trigger errors were less common in patients breathing spontaneously and those able to generate higher pressure–time–product and pressure swings.

To control the epidemiological situation, it is necessary to develop corresponding mathematical models. Mathematical models of COVID-2019 spread described by systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are overviewed. Some of the coefficients and initial data for the ODE systems are unknown or their averaged values are specified. The problem of identifying model parameters is reduced to the minimization of a quadratic objective functional. Since the ODEs are nonlinear, the solution of the inverse epidemiology problems can be nonunique, so approaches for analyzing the identifiability of inverse problems are described. These approaches make it possible to establish which of the unknown parameters (or their combinations) can be uniquely and stably recovered from available additional information. For the minimization problem, methods are presented based on a combination of global techniques (covering methods, nature-like algorithms, multilevel gradient methods) and local techniques (gradient methods and the Nelder–Mead method).","Kabanikhin, S.

Increased utilization of invasive devices such as indwelling urinary catheters and central venous catheters may be needed in this population. Staff minimize contact time with COVID-19 patients. We hypothesized higher rates of device infection in patients with COVID-19. Table 1 [Image: see text] METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study at a 555-bed safety net hospital. 4 units (125 beds) primarily cared for patients with confirmed infection. Other units did not accept patients until COVID status was deemed negative, except Labor & Delivery and a designated mixed unit. Indwelling urinary catheter and central venous catheter (CVC) device days are tracked in all inpatient areas. CLABSI and CAUTI surveillance is performed using NHSN definitions. The first hospitalized COVID-19 case at our hospital occurred late March 2020. April - May 2020 was considered the initial pandemic phase for our institution. Device utilization for the 6 months prior (October 2019 – March 2020) was compared to initial pandemic phase. Device infection rates were also compared. Within the initial pandemic phase, utilization and infection rates were stratified by COVID-19 vs non-COVID-19 areas. RESULTS: Median indwelling urinary catheter usage increased during the initial pandemic period by 36% (998 to 1355 catheter days, p=0.13); CVC usage increased 25% (997 to 1246 CVC days, p=0.13). Hospital-wide, median CAUTI rates remained constant (2.9 and 2.7 infections/1000 catheter days, p=1.00). CLABSI rates increased significantly (0.0 and 1.6 infections/1000 CVC days, p=0.008). CAUTI rates were 83% higher, and CLABSI rates were 65% higher in COVID-19 areas compared to non-COVID-19 areas (Table 1). Urine culture and blood culture ordering were 69% higher and 73% higher in COVID-19 areas, respectively. CONCLUSION: Utilization of both indwelling urinary catheters and CVC increased during the initial phase of the pandemic. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients appear to be at higher risk of both CAUTI and CLABSI. Patient care protocols, device utilization and culture ordering all require further investigation.

44663,E-business adoption costs and strategies for retail micro businesses,2021-01-19,"The global tourism industry has been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic due to strict travel restrictions imposed by most countries. In order to achieve a swift post-pandemic recovery, it is important to understand what psychological obstacles people would face when making travel decisions. Building upon the dual-route theory of information processing, this study examined and compared how the perceived risk of COVID-19 would affect people’s travel intentions in the Japanese city of Sapporo and the Chinese city of Wuhan through two rounds of data collection. While both cities were hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic at an early stage, the cumulative numbers of confirmed human cases and the levels of intervention adopted were largely different. Results from the present study showed that risk perception of COVID-19 had a negative effect on people’s travel intentions in Sapporo. However, no significant effect of COVID-19 perception could be observed in post-lockdown Wuhan. Meanwhile, although the dual-route structure of information processing was obtained in Sapporo and post-lockdown Wuhan, neither routes seemed to predict the perceived risk of COVID-19 in Wuhan when lockdown restrictions were still in place. Several theoretical and practical implications concerning the results are discussed in this study.","Li, Si Ru; Ito, Naoya",Information and Communication Technologies in Tourism 2021,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7798083/,223

44905,Second-order neutrosophic boundary-value problem,2021-01-24,"BACKGROUND: Group A rotavirus (RVA), despite being a leading cause of gastroenteritis in infants and young children, is less studied in Shanxi Province, China. The current study was conducted to determine the prevalence and genetic characterization of RVA in hospitalized children younger than 10 years of age with the diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis in Shanxi Province, China. METHODS: A hospital-based active surveillance of rotavirus gastroenteritis was conducted at Children’s Hospital of Shanxi from Jan 1, 2015, through Dec 31, 2019. Rotavirus was detected in stool samples by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). G- and P-genotypes were determined by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and nucleotide sequencing. RESULTS: A total of 961 children younger than 10 years of age was enrolled over the study period, of whom 183 (19.0%) were positive for RVA. The highest RVA-infection frequency (23.7%) was found among children aged 12–23 months, and the seasonal peak was in December. G9P[8] was most prevalent (76.0%), followed by G3P[8] (7.1%), G2P[4] (3.3%), G1P[8] (0.5%) and G9P[4] (0.5%). CONCLUSIONS: These results report for the first time that RVA was one of the main causes of severe infectious gastroenteritis in children, and a high proportion of G9P[8] strains circulating in most areas of Shanxi Province. While the protective efficacy of the rotavirus vaccines has been demonstrated against G9P[8] strains, our results highlight that the dominant strains have not been effectively controlled in China.

In this article, we employ survey data to analyze the extent to which policy interventions related to COVID-19 have exacerbated gender disparities in child care obligations. We find that existing asymmetrical distributions of child care obligations in Canada and Australia have been amplified during the pandemic, resulting in a disproportionate burden on women. During the pandemic we also find that, in households with children, women tend to report experiencing poorer mental health than men.","Johnston, Regan M.; Mohammed, Anwar; van der Linden, Clifton",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7853744/,223

Articles on the role of micro-current and skin have emerged in recent years. The function of micro-current is various, including introducing various drugs into the skin locally or throughout the body, stimulating skin wounds healing through various currents, suppressing pain caused by various diseases, and promoting blood circulation for postoperative muscle rehabilitation, etc. This article reviews these efforts. Compared with various physical and chemical medical therapies, micro-current stimulation provides a relatively safe, non-invasive therapy with few side effects, giving modern medicine a more suitable treatment option. At the same time, the cost of the electrical stimulation generating device is relatively low, which makes it have wider space to and more clinical application value. The current micro-current stimulation technology has become more and more mature, but there are still many problems in its research. The design of the experiment and the selection of the current parameters not standardized and rigorous. Now, clear regulations are needed to regulate this field.

The apparition of the COVID-19 virus is widely spread to concern all countries worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11 declare COVID-19 a pandemic. This Virus causes a serious infection of the respiratory system. Its high transmission constitutes great problems and challenges. The WHO proposes many actions to limit the spread of the virus such as quarantine and decrease or halt flights between states. The actions taken by states in airports are to detect suspicious persons with COVID-19. We aimed to provide a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) framework to predict suspicious COVID-19 person. This prediction identifies suspicious persons who suffer from shortness breath which is the main symptom of this disease. Extract shortness breath anomaly through the estimated heart rate from face based-video is the main contribution of the present paper. We developed a Smart Recognition COVID-19 (SRC) system to estimate the breath score. In conclusion, our study achieves an accurate breath score. The error is about 1 breath per minute. The proposed solution is of great importance because it helps managers in the airport to predict suspicious COVID-19 passengers.","Ben Ayed, Mossaad; Massaoudi, Ayman; Alshaya, Shaya A.",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7883761/,223

46355,'Sommigen zijn meer gelijk dan anderen': Crisis legt verhoudingen bloot,2021-03-19,"For fact, a strong demand seasonality is observed in hotel industry, which needs early planning to prevent revenue declines. Cost cuts, although sometimes deemed tolerable, no longer help because expenditures have thresholds that hardly can be crossed. Increasing the revenue by raising rates, on the other side, adversely affects the level of demand. In low seasons, travelers are more sensitive to prices, and therefore, higher rates turn customers away to other rivals. To address the compromise between demand, supply, and prices, this work contributes to the existing literature by proposing a model that tests the balance of seasonal demands and prices to maximize hoteliers’ profit. Specifically, we present an approach that finds the seasonal elasticity of demand at the optimum profit. The model is capable of assessing the balance of prices with the market demand, which helps in the assessment of hotels. To validate the model, data sets from Dubai international and domestic hotels were collected and used for benchmarking. It was found that international hotels confront higher seasonality as compared to local hotels. Only couple of hotels (Local and International) demonstrated successful efforts in seasonal balancing of prices with the demand. The demand was also found to be more elastic in the low seasons owing to high room offerings, while less elasticity is observed in the high seasons. The model acts as an effective tool for placing hotels on the board of price and demand, which assists the hoteliers to gain more insights toward benchmarking and evaluation.","Alrawabdeh, Wasfi",J Revenue Pricing Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7910791/,223

Should the role of consent be different if the public health action involves surveillance rather than efforts to change behavior to improve health? Should either individual or community consent be required for the exercise of surveillance? If community consent is required, what constitutes the community and how might it give consent? This chapter explores these difficult questions about consent and communities. It argues that the ethical considerations of respect for persons that lie behind informed consent can be reflected in the roles of public health, groups, communities, and populations in surveillance. Reflecting such respect, however, requires careful attention to the differing ways communities may be defined, in terms of political borders, geography, groups, identities, and interests.

Social workers in particular experience this crisis by providing direct practice and macro-level interventions across a myriad of occupations and ecological systems. Consequently, the prevalence of occupational stress issues, especially shared trauma and burnout, has intensified. Although these are not new issues for healthcare workers, including social workers, COVID-19 has underscored the importance of protecting them with the most effective and practical approaches to alleviate shared stress and burnout. COVID-19 also demonstrates the limitations of self-care, one of the most touted frameworks to reduce shared stress and burnout. This chapter critically examines why self-care has assumed prominence in social work discourse and education, emphasizing its synergy with neoliberal values. It then explores how the intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the deficiencies of self-care. Finally, suggestions are offered that center on structurally mitigating the effects of burnout and shared trauma in social work caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although self-care can be useful in specific roles, the primary onus for reduction of both burnout and shared trauma should be shifted from the individual worker to the organization.","Cohen-Serrins, Julian","Shared Trauma, Shared Resilience During a Pandemic",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978533/,223

The lockdown and economic crisis heighten the risk of abuse and neglect for children in precarious situations and shared trauma for PCW workers dealing with increased work and personal stressors. Symptoms of shared trauma can impede PCW workers from fulfilling job demands and responsibilities, which leads to inadequate resources for children in need of permanency and can potentially harm service delivery outcomes. The risk of significant shared traumatic stress among PCW workers thus needs to be mitigated with protective factors.

The importance of these two policy objectives comes to the fore, especially when viewed through the lens of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. Growth is critical for combating poverty and undertaking redistributive measures to mitigate inequality within nations (SDGs 1 and 10), whereas managing inflation, especially food inflation, lies at the core of strategies designed to end hunger and achieve food and nutrition security (SDG 2). The performance evaluation undertaken in the paper is based on a review of relevant literature in the Indian context, focusing especially on the post-liberalization period. Given the centrality of monetary policy measures in the Indian government’s response to the economic pandemic wrought by COVID-19, perhaps such an appraisal is needed now, more than ever before. To begin with, a brief overview of the conduct of monetary policy in India provides the necessary background for the remaining analysis. The effectiveness of monetary transmission in affecting aggregate demand and output in the Indian context, especially in recent times, is examined thereafter. The phenomenon of inflation, especially food price inflation and the efficacy of monetary measures in controlling it, is discussed next. Findings from the literature are then used to assess recent liquidity measures of the Indian government for economic revival in pandemic times and conclude.","Dastidar, Ananya Ghosh; Kaur, Kajleen",Sustainable Development Insights from India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978633/,223

Sharingan accepts raw network traces as inputs and reports potential patterns of the target traffic in NetQRE, a domain specific language designed for specifying session-layer quantitative properties. We develop a range of novel optimizations that reduce the synthesis time for large and complex tasks to a matter of minutes.

They are critical global nodes that link the world and facilitate economic development. In 2020, the global aviation industry was brought to a near standstill by the COVID-19 pandemic, with devastating global economic and associated impacts. This study evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on the airports’ sector. Using archival and secondary data from authoritative sources such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), EUROCONTROL and Flightradar24, it emerged that COVID-19 had a negative impact on airport operations mainly affecting their revenue streams. Travel restrictions and border closures had a debilitating impact on the airports and the aviation component of the tourism industry. With airlines grounded, the airports converted into parking lots and ghost towns. With this, there were drastic declines in receipt in landing, departure fees and non-aeronautical revenue. The remaining limited operations that continued in many airports related to service and facilitate the delivery of medical and other essential supplies, including food and critical raw materials. These could not raise adequate revenues to sustain many airports.

This study analyzes the impacts stemming from the realization of sport tourism events, focusing on the case of the world famous and spectacular Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series event in the Azores. The primary objective of this research is to assess the main economic impacts of this event, its importance for regional development, the perceptions of respondents, and the levels of satisfaction with it – both in a global sense and for several dimensions of the event – using a novel primary dataset, with individual survey data. The results support the idea that this event has important economic impacts and suggest that most participants are generally satisfied, although some aspects that could be improved have been identified. Most respondents consider this event to be important for tourism and economic development, and a large proportion consider it important for the social development and cultural development of the region in which it takes place.","Avelar, Melissa; Sousa, Áurea; Menezes, António","Advances in Tourism, Technology and Systems",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980919/,223

At the same time, tourism is one of the fastest growing economic sectors and can play and important role in boosting a country’s economy. This paper aims to analyse the impact of ICT and tourism on economic growth in European and Central Asian countries. The analysis is based on a sample of 42 countries over the period 1995–2018. Using panel data estimation techniques, the results suggest that ICT (a composed index of internet users, fixed broadband and mobile cellular subscriptions) and tourism are important determinants of economic growth. The results also reveal that and increase in the burden caused by non-working people on a nation’s working-age population has adverse effects on economic growth, while urbanization and inflation are insignificant. Promoting technology advancements, ICT diffusion and tourism expansion can foster economic growth.","Castro, Conceição; Ferreira, Fernanda A.; Nunes, Pedro","Advances in Tourism, Technology and Systems",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980938/,223
49658,Conclusion,2020-08-28,"The concept of diversity has its origins in the US civil rights movement, which fought against racism against people of colour. Diversity thus initially stood for the creation of equal opportunities for groups who are disadvantaged according to certain characteristics. In the USA, this resulted in the Anti-Discrimination Act and the Affirmative Action to promote disadvantaged groups according to the criteria of race, gender, skin colour, ethnic origin, age, disability or religion. The civil rights movement of the USA had a great influence on the development of further social movements of previously disadvantaged and discriminated groups, e.g. B. on the movement of the Native Americans.","Helmold, Marc","New Work, Transformational and Virtual Leadership",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980996/,223

First, we present an overview of Bronfenbrenner’s bioecological systems theory and the ways the theory has shifted to better reflect psychological processes and the contexts that influence them. Second, we focus on immigration as a compelling topic of study using bioecological systems theory. Specifically, we address how the landscape of immigration provides opportunities for in-depth research into the ways it affects individuals through history, families, culture, and school.

We highlight and define key terms such as “sustainability” and “disruption” by showing how sustainable models of birth flexibly respond and adapt to disruptive times of rising social inequalities compounded by the uncertainties of climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe models of care that disrupt binaries that pit providers against patients, hospitals against home birth settings, obstetric against midwifery models of care, high- resource versus low-resource settings, and bureaucracies versus individuals. We lay out an evidence-based framework for adopting sustainable midwifery models of care across the globe that are adaptable and resilient in the face of rising social inequality and scarcity. We address the growing consensus that promoting costly obstetric care across the globe at the expense of midwifery care can produce care that is either TLTL (too little too late) or TMTS (too much too soon). Instead we illustrate models of care that provide evidence-based, timely, humanistic, and holistic care in order to improve maternal and newborn outcomes.","Gutschow, Kim; Davis-Floyd, Robbie",Sustainable Birth in Disruptive Times,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7982973/,223

We propose a general semantic construction of dependent refinement type systems from underlying type systems and predicate logic, that is, a construction of liftings of closed comprehension categories from given (underlying) closed comprehension categories and posetal fibrations for predicate logic. We give sufficient conditions to lift structures such as dependent products, dependent sums, computational effects, and recursion from the underlying type systems to dependent refinement type systems. We demonstrate the usage of our construction by giving semantics to a dependent refinement type system and proving soundness.","Kura, Satoshi",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984113/,223

As a result of the restrictions in place due to the pandemic, critical aspects of our impact on the environment have been brought to our attention. This chapter focuses on such insights, and emphasises on how the observations during this time could help us understand the need of the hour, i.e., learning to share the same space with other species on the planet. To achieve this state, the priorities would have to shift from an attitude of constant consumption and short-term satisfaction, to a sense of well-being based on community and harmony with nature. The chapter further goes on to explore the contribution of psychology in changing the existing unsustainable actions of humans towards pro-environment and sustainable behaviour through an examination of both the contributing factors as well as obstacles to achieving such a change. Finally, a psychosocial model for sustainable action is proposed, focusing on promoting global health, wealth and peace; thus, creating a safe and secure space for all living beings.","Shwetha, T.

The pipeline consisted of three stages: preprocessing, word-by-word vectorisation using models obtained with various methods to map vectors from two independent vector spaces to a common one, and search for the most similar papers based on the cosine similarity of text vectors. The four methods used can be grouped into two approaches: 1) aligning two pretrained monolingual word embedding models with a bilingual dictionary on our own (for example, with the VecMap algorithm) and 2) using pre-aligned cross-lingual word embedding models (MUSE). To find out, which approach brings more benefit to the task, we conducted a manual evaluation of the results and calculated the average precision of recommendations for all the methods mentioned above. MUSE turned out to have the highest search relevance, but the other methods produced more recommendations in a language other than the one of the target paper.","Safaryan, Anna; Filchenkov, Petr; Yan, Weijia; Kutuzov, Andrey; Nikishina, Irina","Recent Trends in Analysis of Images, Social Networks and Texts",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7988405/,223

The Antarctica that we now label a ‘continent for peace and science’ is, however, very much a product of the Cold War. With the USSR and the US refusing to recognise national claims to the continent, the 1959 Antarctic Treaty emerged as a truce that put all claims into a kind of indefinite suspension. Geopolitical tensions nonetheless permeate imaginative texts that engaged with the region throughout the later twentieth century.

Jocelynne Scutt relates the importance of women’s hair through history, its impact in religious orders, romance and male attraction, and how not only colour, texture, length and thickness can be manufactured, but bad hair days can become long-lived nightmares. Are such outcomes compensable through legal action for negligence? If so, what is the level of damages? What of noses reshaped, ears pinned back, skin stretched taut over cheekbones chasing wrinkle elimination? The history of the facelift is a story in itself, going from outer skin manipulation, to subcutaneous fat and thence to bone structure, recognising that bone loss will impact on how well a woman’s cheeks hold up to ageing. As Jocelynne Scutt warns, a woman’s wish for a wondrously youthful outcome may not be met through surgery, but recompense through law requires a failure of surgical technique, not patient or client dissatisfaction. As for teeth, whitening and false crowns or veneers can make a smile translucent or lead to litigation with enamel stripped, gums diseased, and damages claimed. Receding jaws can be refashioned into defined curve, or too firm definition into gentle contour. Yet just as discontent may drive a woman into the clinic, salon or surgery, it can accompany her exit. Botoxed and botched lips figure highly in compensation claims, too, an original desire for a pleasantly puffed-up appearance generating displeasure at a puckered pout. But as Jocelynne Scutt explains, dissatisfaction is not the measure for determining negligence. In a courtroom, the failure of hair or beauty treatments or face-changing surgery to satisfy is immaterial. There, practitioners are adjudged on skill, not a woman’s woes.","Scutt, Jocelynne A.","Beauty, Women's Bodies and the Law",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7990664/,223

These more conserved regions are often hidden and difficult to access by the human immune system but recent efforts have shown that these may be the Achilles heel of the virus through development and delivery of appropriate biological drugs. Amongst these, single domain antibodies (sdAbs) are equipped to target these vulnerabilities of the influenza virus due to their preference for concave epitopes on protein surfaces, their small size, flexible reformatting and high stability.

Two types of influenza virus, A and B cause seasonal flu epidemics, whereas type A can cause influenza pandemics. To specifically detect influenza A (IAV) and B (IBV) viruses, we developed a clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) system-based assay. By coupling reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), a CRISPR-Cas12a DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans-reporter (DETECTR) detected IAV and IBV titers as low as 1 × 10(0) plaque forming units (PFUs) per reaction without exhibiting cross-reactivity. Only 75 to 85 min were required to detect IAV and IBV, depending on isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods, and results were verified using a lateral flow strip assay that does not require additional analytic equipment. Taken together, our findings establish RT-RPA and RT-LAMP-coupled DETECTR-based diagnostic tests for rapid, specific and high-sensitivity detection of IAV and IBV using fluorescence and lateral flow assays. The diagnostic test developed in this study can be used to distinguish IAV and IBV infections, a capability that is necessary for monitoring and preventing the spread of influenza epidemics and pandemics.","Park, Bum Ju; Park, Man Seong; Lee, Jae Myun; Song, Yoon Jae",Biosensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8003587/,223

The study was done to compare the rise in Hct after transfusing PRBC volume calculated either based on body weight or using formula considering Hct of blood bag and Hct of preterm neonates. This prospective study included a total of 68 preterm neonates requiring transfusion for the first time having ≤ 34 weeks of gestational age. Neonates were randomized using block randomization, to receive 15 ml/kg of PRBC transfusion (group A) or transfusion based on the formula (group B). The primary outcome of interest was post-transfusion rise in hematocrit. The secondary outcome was the effect of transfusion on neonatal morbidities in terms of retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and death. Baseline variables (birth weight, gestation age, APGAR score and score of neonatal acute physiology) pre-transfusion hemodynamics and hematocrit of the bag were comparable in both groups. The mean volume of PRBC in group A was 18.8 ± 4.9 ml, whereas in group B it was 29.6 ± 7.3 ml, p = 0.0001. Group B transfusions had a statistically significant change in 24 h post-transfusion hematocrit. Secondary outcomes were comparable in two groups.

Thus, a nonlinear programming model was established and optimized, for which a genetic algorithm is designed. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed diversified AHP-tree approach, it was applied to a supplier selection problem. The experimental results showed that the application of the diversified AHP-tree approach enabled the selection of multiple diversified suppliers from a single judgement matrix.

METHOD: A combination of telephone calls, emails, photography, and Microsoft Teams software was utilised to facilitate a virtual review service. Our initial adoption of the system was audited during April and May 2020. Through Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) methodology an electronic tertiary-referral proforma was established prior to closure of the audit cycle in July 2020. RESULTS: From the start of lockdown a significant reduction in face-to-face consultations was observed. Given the increasing use of virtual telephone consultation only 19.5% of the unit's total referrals (April, May, and July) were either reviewed face-to-face in dressing clinic or admitted. A target of 100% data point entry (including demographic, clinical, and initial management) for patients entering the virtual service was set. Following implementation of the e-Referral pathway an improvement in both the detail and completeness (95%) of patient referral information was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience demonstrates that virtual burns care can be safely and rapidly adapted in response to evolving need. The potential role of virtual care post-COVID, in selected patients, is an exciting one.","Hayes, J; Clements, J; McGarry, K; Rashid, A",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135957/,223

PCV3 replication involves the entry of the viral capsid (Cap) protein with nucleolar localization signals into the nucleus. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, nucleolar phosphoprotein NPM1 was identified as one of the cellular proteins bound to PCV3 Cap. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that PCV3 Cap interacts directly with NPM1, where the region binding with NPM1 is mapped to amino acid residues 1–38 of Cap. Upon co-transfection, the expression of Cap protein promoted the redistribution of NPM1, which translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and colocalized with Cap in cultured PK15 cells. NPM1 expression was upregulated and translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in PCV3-infected cells, upon siRNA-mediated depletion, or upon treatment with NPM1 inhibitor in PK15 cells with impaired PCV3 replication, as evidenced by decreased levels of viral DNA synthesis and protein expression. By contrast, the replication of PCV3 was enhanced in stably NPM1-expressing cells via a lentivirus-delivered system. Taken together, these findings indicate that NPM1 interacts with PCV3 Cap and plays a crucial role in PCV3 replication.","Song, Jiangwei; Hou, Lei; Wang, Dan; Wei, Li; Zhu, Shanshan; Wang, Jing; Quan, Rong; Jiang, Haijun; Shi, Ruihan; Liu, Jue",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8185148/,223

Relapse was defined as clinical disease relapse or biochemical disease relapse (C-reactive protein (CRP) level ≥5 mg/L without other, non-IBD related explanation). Associations between relapse and IFX delay were analyzed. [Image: see text] RESULTS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including 166 CD patients receiving maintenance IFX infusion during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of all, 135 (81.3%) had delayed their IFX infusion. Only 31 (18.7%) followed the schedule infusion during the COVID-19 pandemic. The median time of the IFX delay was 18.6±17.1 days. The relapse rate in the IFX-delay group was significantly higher than the group without delay (25.9% versus 5.5%, P＜0.02). During a median IFX delay interval of 46 days (95% CI 20.9–71.1), the ratio of relapse increased with the increase of IFX delay intervals. Delay interval had a cumulative effect on disease recurrence. We proposed interval prolongation resulted in a significant IFX trough concentration reduction. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Our study provided real-world evidence of influence on relapse of IFX delay in CD patients undergone maintenance therapy. It might help the IBD specialists arrange reasonable IFX treatment intervals for patients.","Guo, H; Tang, J; Huang, Z; Li, B; Yang, Q; Chao, K; Gao, X",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194577/,223
54405,Sportler mit Stoffmaske sollten Aktivitätsprogramm anpassen,2021-06-25,"BACKGROUND: The broad use of immunosuppressants and biologicals in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients increases the susceptibility to severe infections, and possibly COVID-19. Recently, in a Swedish population-based study it was suggested that IBD patients are at an increased risk of hospitalization for COVID-19, although course of COVID-19 did not differ from controls. Data on the outcome of COVID-19 in IBD patients from heavily affected regions remain, however, limited. South-Limburg has the second highest COVID-19 mortality rate in the Netherlands. We aimed to determine the incidence rate and outcome of severe COVID-19 in IBD patients in a population-based setting in South-Limburg. METHODS: We identified all IBD patients who presented at the emergency department (ED) of the only two hospitals covering the whole South-Limburg region with COVID-19 associated symptoms between February 27 and November 1, 2020. Confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis was defined by a combination of COVID-19 associated symptoms and either a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or a CT-CORADS score ≥4. As primary outcome, the incidence rate of severe COVID-19 (i.e. confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis requiring hospitalization, and/or resulting in ICU admission or death) was determined. Baseline characteristics and data on COVID-19 course were collected. At present, the total IBD population in South-Limburg is set at 4980 patients. RESULTS: During a follow-up of 3384 person-years, a total of 61 IBD patients (1.22%) presented with COVID-19 associated symptoms at one of the two hospital’s ED. Of these, 18 IBD patients (0.36%; 11 UC, 7 CD) fulfilled the criteria for severe COVID-19, corresponding to an incidence rate of 5.3 per 1000 person-years. Furthermore, 12/18 patients were using immunosuppressive medication for their IBD. Mean age at time of admission was 64.5 years (SD: 10.8) and 55.6% were male. All hospitalized patients had at least one comorbidity (with ≥ 1 comorbidity in 13/18 patients (72.2%)), cardiovascular disease being most prevalent (12/18). Mean BMI at time of admission was 27.3 (SD: 4.2). Thirteen patients (72.2%) required oxygen support and three patients (16.7%) ICU admission (of which two needed mechanical ventilation), translating to an incidence rate of 0.9 per 1000 patient-years for ICU admission. Median length of hospitalization was 11 days (IQR: 5.3–18.3). No IBD patients died due to severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The incidence rate of severe COVID-19 among IBD patients in a population-based setting in a heavily affected region was 5.3 per 1000 person-years. Despite frequent use of immunosuppressive medication and high region-specific mortality rates, clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19 were comparable to the general population and in line with recent literature.","Rezazadeh Ardabili, A; Creemers, R H; Jonkers, D M A E; Romberg-Camps, M J L; Pierik, M J; van Bodegraven, A A",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194845/,223
54572,Existence and data dependence results for fractional differential equations involving atangana-baleanu derivative,2021-06-17,"BACKGROUND: The course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is punctuated by exacerbations, most often of infectious origin, responsible for many intensive care unit (ICU) and intermediate care unit (IMCU) admissions. Our objective was to study in-hospital mortality during severe COPD exacerbations in ICU and IMCU based on the performance of bronchoscopy. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out on stays in ICUs for COPD exacerbation from the French Programme for the Medicalisation of Information Systems databases for the years 2014 and 2015. Propensity score matching of stays made it possible to constitute two comparable groups on the factors of excess mortality described in the literature (age, sex, SAPS 2, type of admission and bronchial tumour). RESULTS: We identified 14,491 stays for COPD exacerbation in ICUs, 2586 of which received a bronchoscopy. Mortality was significantly higher in the fibroscopy group (31.32% versus 19.8%). After propensity score matching, we found an excess of mortality in the intervention group (OR = 1.749 [1.516–2.017]) associated with a significantly longer length of stay. The main diagnoses associated with an increased risk of death were pulmonary embolism (OR = 3.251 [1.126–9.384]), bacterial pneumonia (OR = 1.906 [1.173–3.098]) and acute respiratory failure (OR = 1.840 [1.486–2.278]). CONCLUSIONS: Performing bronchoscopy during ICU hospitalisations for severe COPD exacerbations was associated with increased mortality. This increased mortality appears to be related to a bias in patient selection with a procedure reserved for patients with the adverse course.

55222,Schichtarbeitende im Dauer-Jetlag,2021-07-07,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) is responsible for many pathological processes, such as altered vascular disease development, dysfunctional thrombosis, and a heightened inflammatory state. Although many clinical reports support these observations, there has been limited experimental work to determine the underlying mechanisms and cellular processes induced by exposure to SARS‐CoV‐2 structural proteins. Importantly, these structural proteins are conserved amongst all current known SARS‐CoVs. Our objective was to investigate the effects of the Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N), and Membrane‐Envelope (M) SARS‐CoV‐2 structural proteins on inflammation, thrombosis, and diabetic disease markers of human aortic adventitial fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. We hypothesized that short‐term exposure to SARS‐CoV‐2 structural proteins would result in increased expression of inflammatory, thrombotic, and diabetic proteins in both cell types, which would support a mechanism for altered vascular disease progression. To test this, the cells were incubated independently with the three SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins for one hour, after which we analyzed the expression of gC1qR, ICAM‐1, tissue factor, RAGE, GLUT‐4, thrombomodulin, PECAM‐1, and Connexin‐43 (in their respective cell types), using an ELISA approach. All cells were monitored for maintenance of typical culture parameters using a live/dead cell cytotoxicity assay and the MTT assay (for metabolic activity). We observed that each of these markers were significantly up‐regulated after exposure to SARS‐CoV‐2 structural proteins as compared to fibroblasts or endothelial cells that were not exposed to these proteins. Interestingly, the extent of the expression of these markers was sometimes significantly different for each of the SARS‐CoV‐2 structural proteins. This suggests that each of the SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins interacts with these cells through different mechanisms, however, more work will need to be undertaken to determine the mechanisms by which these proteins interact with cells. Thus, these results indicate that the cellular response of vascular cells towards SARS‐CoV‐2 structural proteins promotes inflammatory, thrombotic, and vascular dysfunction. However, these interactions are regulated by complex and possibly different cellular receptors/signal transduction pathways that should be explored further.","Freda, Christopher; Yin, Wei; Ghebrehiwet, Berhane; Rubenstein, David",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239652/,223
55247,Neues zu Hypertonie und Diabetes,2021-07-01,"Provision of responsible healthcare to patients by healthcare professionals (HCP) during the COVID‐19 pandemic has lead to the development of symptoms of stress, anxiety, fear, and other strong emotions that has predisposed HCP to significant potential for mental health diagnosis including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In a metanalysis, Mealer et al (2009) and others reported that how one copes with these emotions and stressful conditions may affect the quality of healthcare provided to others, and the well‐being of the people they care about both within and outside of their work environment. The recent emergence of more highly infective mutations of SARS‐CoV‐2 [COVID‐19], identified as SARS‐CoV‐2 VUI 202012/01 in the USA with a reportedly 50‐70% greater contagious potential than the novel strain has sparked great concern throughout Europe, the United Kingdom and the USA, resulting in both International and Domestic travel limitations attempts to slow the continued spread of the coronavirus pandemic in attempts to contain the mutations, albeit it unsuccessful so far. PTSD and other mental health disorders may develop in individuals following exposure to a traumatic event or ongoing circumstances as has occurred among healthcare workers in the current pandemic as well as among returning combat veterans and disaster stricken regions and may be a precipitating cause of PTSD among HCPs and may contribute to their symptoms following prolonged exposure to their seemingly unending and highly stressful patient care responsibilities, and which symptoms may escape observation by others similarly affected in the treatment chain. The results of this metanalysis study indicate that according to Tang et al (2017), healthcare providers that were exposed to Avian Influenza virus (H7N9) patients were significantly prone (p=<0.05) to developing severe anxiety, PTSD stress and burnout symptoms, indicating a need for greater pre‐exposure training in traumatic illness stress management to better prepare them for early‐stage career management, particularly during the early stages of their careers. The recent emergence of SARS‐CoV‐2 VUI 202012/01 and more recent variants, potentially 50% or more contagious strains of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus with as yet unknown risks for morbidity and mortality particularly among smokers may pose such a threat among the general population and the among the HCP who may be tasked for their healthcare, wellbeing, and all to often, palliative supportive care, despite the best efforts of epidemiologic surveillance and containment via application of conventional public health measures and available resources.

55298,Treading water,2021-06-14,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV‐2) encoded nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) orchestrates a multi‐pronged mechanism to suppress host gene expression, also known as the host shutoff. Current literature suggests that the C‐terminus of nsp1 competes for the mRNA binding site in the 40S ribosome, preventing host translation from host mRNAs. However, several mutations on surface residues of nsp1 are reported to either attenuate or augment its host shutoff function suggesting a role of these surface amino acids in dampening host gene expression. Additionally, nsp1 of SARS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV‐2 share 84% sequence identity, prompting us to believe they share a similar mechanism of host shutoff. To identify cellular proteins that interact with nsp1 and assist its function, we isolated host proteins proximal to nsp1 in human epithelial kidney (HEK) cells using the proximity‐dependent biotinylation experiment by expressing nsp1 fused to BIOID2. BioID2 is a promiscuous bacterial biotin ligase protein that attaches biotin to free lysine residues of nearby proteins. Biotin treatment of these cells incorporates biotin tag on proteins proximal to nsp1. Using streptavidin magnetic beads, we isolated these proteins and identified them using mass spectroscopy. Finally, several factors were verified by western blot. By comparing protein complexes, we identified a group of proteins including ribosomal proteins that are likely involved in host shutoff. In addition to the ribosomal proteins, factors implicated in the stress granule formation and RNA processing are identified and verified. These proteins are common in both SARS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV‐2. Currently, we are using similar methods to verify the binding of these proteins to nsp1 mutations in the N‐terminus and C‐terminus.","Nag, Anita; Gerassimovich, Yevgeniy; Miladinovski‐Bengall, Samantha",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239892/,223

Diagnosis accuracy and delay have been the major drivers for the upsurge of M/XDR-TB. Pyrosequencing (PSQ) is a novel, real-time DNA sequencing for rapid detection of mutations associated with M/XDR-TB. We aimed to systematically synthesize the evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of PSQ for M/XDR-TB. METHODS: We conducted an electronic search of PubMed, Embase, Biosis, Web of Science, and Google Scholar up to March 2020. We used the QUADAS‐2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) tool to assess the quality of studies, the BRMA (bivariate random‐effects meta-analysis) model to synthesize diagnostic accuracies, and the Rev-Man 5.4 software to perform the meta-analyses. We analyzed dichotomous data using the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval. PROSPERO Registration ID: CRD42020200817. RESULTS: The analysis included seven studies, with a total sample of 3,165. At 95% confidence interval, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of PSQ were 89.7 (CI: 83.5–93.8) and 97.8 (CI: 94.9–99.1) for Isoniazid, 94.6 (CI: 90.9–96.8) and 98.5 (CI: 96.5–99.3) for Rifampicin, 87.9 (CI: 81.2–92.4) and 98.8 (CI: 97.2–99.5) for Fluoroquinolone, 83.5 (CI: 72.8–90.5) and 99.4 (CI: 98.3–99.8) for Amikacin, 79 (CI: 67–8-87) and 97.9 (CI: 95.5–99) for Capreomycin, and 69.6 (CI: 57–79.8) and 98.2 (CI: 95.9–99.2) for Kanamycin. The overall pooled sensitivity and specificity were 85.8 (CI: 76.7–91.7) and 98.5 (CI: 96.5–99.3), respectively.

Since crosstalk between endothelial cells (ECs) and PCs greatly impacts the function of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), effects of PCs on endothelial integrity and function have been investigated extensively. However, the impact of ECs on the function and activity of PCs remains largely unknown. Hence, using co-cultures of human brain vascular PCs with human cerebral microvascular ECs on opposite sides of porous Transwell inserts which facilitates direct EC–PC contact and improves EC barrier function, we analyzed EC-driven transcriptomic changes in PCs using microarrays and changes in cytokines/chemokines using proteome arrays. Gene expression analysis (GEA) in PCs co-cultured with ECs versus PCs cultured alone showed significant upregulation of 1′334 genes and downregulation of 964 genes. GEA in co-cultured PCs revealed increased expression of five prominent PC markers as well as soluble factors, such as transforming growth factor beta, fibroblast growth factor, angiopoietin 1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, all of which are involved in EC–PC crosstalk and BBB induction. Pathway enrichment analysis of modulated genes showed a strong impact on many inflammatory and extracellular matrix (ECM) pathways including interferon and interleukin signaling, TGF-β and interleukin-1 regulation of ECM, as well as on the mRNA processing pathway. Interestingly, while co-culture induced the mRNA expression of many chemokines and cytokines, including several CCL- and CXC-motif ligands and interleukins, we observed a decreased expression of the same inflammatory mediators on the protein level. Importantly, in PCs, ECs significantly induced interferon associated proteins (IFIT1, IFI44L, IF127, IFIT3, IFI6, IFI44) with anti-viral actions; downregulated prostaglandin E receptor 2 (prevent COX-2 mediated BBB damage); upregulated fibulin-3 and connective tissue growth factor essential for BBB integrity; and multiple ECMs (collagens and integrins) that inhibit cell migration. Our findings suggest that via direct contact, ECs prime PCs to induce molecules to promote BBB integrity and cell survival during infection and inflammatory insult. Taken together, we provide first evidence that interaction with ECs though porous membranes induces major changes in the transcriptomic and proteomic profile of PCs. ECs influence genes involved in diverse aspects of PC function including PC maturation, cell survival, anti-viral defense, blood flow regulation, immuno-modulation and ECM deposition.","Kurmann, Lisa; Okoniewski, Michal; Dubey, Raghvendra K.",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8304094/,223

56812,WAC Virtual Inter-Congress Archaeology on the Global Stage,2021-08-17,"PURPOSE: Severe trauma may lead to the systemic release of inflammatory mediators into the circulation with profound acute-phase responses; however, the understanding of the expression of these mediators remains limited. This study aimed to characterize the alterations in the expression of circulating acute-phase proteins, cytokines, and checkpoint proteins in patients with severe trauma injuries. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population included trauma patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with an injury severity score equal to or greater than 16 and who had used a ventilator for 48 hours. A total of 12 female and 28 male patients were recruited for the study; six patients died and 34 survived. Blood samples collected at acute stages were compared with those drawn at the subacute stage, the time when the patients were discharged from the ICU, or before the discharge of the patients from the hospital. RESULTS: The study identified that the expression of acute-phase proteins, such as alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and C-reactive protein, and cytokines, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, was elevated in the circulation after severe trauma. In contrast, the levels of acute-phase proteins, such as alpha-2-macroglobulin, serum amyloid P, and von Willebrand factor, and cytokines, including interleukin-4 and interferon gamma-induced protein 10, were reduced. However, there were no significant differences in the expression of checkpoint proteins in the circulation. CONCLUSION: The dysregulated proteins identified in this study may serve as potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for treating patients with severe trauma. However, the related biological functions of these dysregulated factors require further investigation to validate their functions.","Wu, Shao-Chun; Rau, Cheng-Shyuan; Kuo, Pao-Jen; Shih, Fu-Yuan; Lin, Hui-Ping; Wu, Yi-Chan; Hsieh, Ting-Min; Liu, Hang-Tsung; Hsieh, Ching-Hua",J Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8354739/,223

OBJECTIVES: To describe and evaluate the performance of the VI-RADS score using mpMRI and assess its potential clinical applications and limitations. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using the MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic bibliographic databases between June 2020 and December 2020. All reports deemed relevant to describe the VI-RADS score and assess its performance and applications were retrieved. Results presentation stands as narrative, purely descriptive synthesis based on aggregate studies data. RESULTS: A total of 20 relevant studies were retrieved: three meta-analyses, five prospective studies, and twelve retrospective studies. The retrospective studies covered 1676 patients, while the prospective studies included a total number of 468 patients. Pooled sensitivity, specificity to differentiate muscle-invasive from non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, ranged from 74.1% to 97.3%, and 77% to 100%, respectively. The chosen VI-RADS score thresholds for this discrimination varied across studies. The interreader agreement ranged from 0.73 to 0.95. Currently, the potential clinical applications of VI-RADS consist of initial BC risk stratification, assessment of neoadjuvant therapies response, and bladder sparing approaches, although further validation is required. CONCLUSIONS: The VI-RADS score helps to discriminate muscle invasive from non-muscle invasive BC with good performance and reproducibility. A simple algorithm based on four basic questions may enhance its popularization. Further studies are required to validate the clinical applications.","Séguier, Denis; Puech, Philippe; Kool, Ronald; Dernis, Léa; Gabert, Héléna; Kassouf, Wassim; Villers, Arnauld; Marcq, Gautier",Ther Adv Urol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8392809/,223

Open spaces play a vital role in healing the natural environment as well as the physical and mental health of the citizens. This paper presents an exploratory eco-park design project in Helwan, Egypt. The project focuses on the opportunity of integrating marginalised natural environments, such as Wadis (dry streams), with the urban fabric through Eco-landscape design. The current work explores the complex environment, characterised by detailed multidisciplinary data, which requires multi-layer analysis. The discussion evaluates the tremendous effect of integrating the participatory qualitative method with other analytical and digital tools, such as modelling and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), to deduce scientific details and activities in the preliminary phases of zoning plans. This results in a constructive framework for merging these multi-methods and tools within the participatory eco-landscape design process. In addition, the conclusion highlights the peculiarity of the eco-landscape design and practice in the current Egyptian situation in a broad sense.","Okasha, Alia Sameh; Mekkawy, Asmaa Aly El",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8492091/,223

Methods: The PubMed and Embase databases were searched for eligible studies published up to July 2020 (PROSPERO: CRD42018091692). The non-linear or linear exposure–effect relationship between PA and AF was examined using the robust error meta-regression method. Results: A total of 16 prospective studies involving 1,449,017 individuals and 39,884 AF cases were included. We observed an inverse non-linear association between PA level and incident AF (I(2) = 0%, p(non−linearity) < 0.001). In the linear model, a 5 metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-h/week increase in PA was associated with a decreased risk of AF [risk ratio (RR) = 0.992, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.988–0.996, I(2) = 0%]. In the sex-stratified analysis, we observed an inverse non-linear relationship between PA level and AF risk in females (I(2) = 90%, p(non−linearity) < 0.0001) but not in males (I(2) = 0%, p(non−linearity) = 0.40). In the linear model, a 5 MET-h/week increase in PA was associated with a reduced risk of AF in females (RR = 0.982, 95% CI: 0.975–0.989, I(2) = 71%) but not in males (RR = 0.998, 95% CI: 0.994–1.002, I(2) = 0%), with a significant interaction observed between the two groups (p(interaction) < 0.0001). Conclusion: There was an inverse non-linear relationship between PA level and incident AF in the general population.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality of life and burden of caregiving of primary caregivers of children with disability registered in a CBR services in rural Karnataka. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was done among 100 children with disability and their primary caregivers. Interview schedule including socio-demography, WHOQOL-BREF, ZBI and WHODAS was used. RESULTS: Mean age of caregivers was 36.38 of which 97% were women and 82% were mothers of children with disability. Mean age of children was 11.43 years, 56% males and most common diagnosis was multiple disabilities (38%). Mean caregiver burden according to Zarit scale was 33.27 and mean burden scores were significantly different between the disability domains of the children. Mean quality of life (QOL) scores for each domain was 49.6 in physical, 60.47 in psychological, 45.67 in social and 58.44 in environmental domains. Marital status of the caregivers was significantly associated with both physical and the social domain of the QOL. Occupation of the caregiver was significantly associated with the environmental domain and the type of disability in the children significantly affected the physical domain of the QOL of the caregivers. CONCLUSION: Caregiver QOL is overall poor but it was the lowest in the physical domain and higher in psychological domain. Caregiver burden scores were high and depends on the type of disability.

59842,Q&A: How to market vaccination.,2021-01-15,"WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: BACKGROUND:: Triple-low events (mean arterial pressure less than 75 mmHg, Bispectral Index less than 45, and minimum alveolar fraction less than 0.8) are associated with mortality but may not be causal. This study tested the hypothesis that providing triple-low alerts to clinicians reduces 90-day mortality. METHODS Adults having noncardiac surgery with volatile anesthesia and Bispectral Index monitoring were electronically screened for triple-low events. Patients having triple-low events were randomized in real time, with clinicians either receiving an alert, ""consider hemodynamic support,"" or not. Patients were blinded to treatment. Helpful responses to triple-low events were defined by administration of a vasopressor within 5 min or a 20% reduction in end-tidal volatile anesthetic concentration within 15 min. RESULTS Of the qualifying patients, 7,569 of 36,670 (20%) had triple-low events and were randomized. All 7,569 were included in the primary analysis. Ninety-day mortality was 8.3% in the alert group and 7.3% in the nonalert group. The hazard ratio (95% CI) for alert versus nonalert was 1.14 (0.96, 1.35); P = 0.12, crossing a prespecified futility boundary. Clinical responses were helpful in about half the patients in each group, with 51% of alert patients and 47% of nonalert patients receiving vasopressors or having anesthetics lowered after start of triple low (P < 0.001). There was no relationship between the response to triple-low events and adjusted 90-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS Real-time alerts to triple-low events did not lead to a reduction in 90-day mortality, and there were fewer responses to alerts than expected. However, similar mortality with and without responses suggests that there is no strong relationship between responses to triple-low events and mortality.","Sessler, Daniel I; Turan, Alparslan; Stapelfeldt, Wolf H; Mascha, Edward J; Yang, Dongsheng; Farag, Ehab; Cywinski, Jacek; Vlah, Claudene; Kopyeva, Tatyana; Keebler, Allen L; Perilla, Mauricio; Ramachandran, Mangakalaraip; Drahuschak, Sean; Kaple, Kristina; Kurz, Andrea",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000002480; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30312182/,223
59885,Covid-19: what next?,2020-07-25,"INTRODUCTION The role and application of robotic surgery are debated, particularly given the expansion of laparoscopy, especially laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery. This cohort study was undertaken to delineate differences in outcomes between LESS and robotic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. METHODS With Institutional Review Board approval, patients undergoing LESS or robotic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy from September 1, 2012, through December 31, 2014, were prospectively observed, and data were collected. The results are expressed as the median, with the mean ± SD. RESULTS Thirty-four patients underwent a minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy: 18 with robotic and 16 with LESS surgery. The patients were similar in sex, age, and body mass index. Conversions to open surgery and estimated blood loss were similar. There were two intraoperative complications in the group that underwent the robotic approach. Time spent in the operating room was significantly longer with the robot (297 vs 254 minutes, P = .03), although operative duration (i.e., incision to closure) was not longer (225 vs 190 minutes; P = .15). Of the operations studied, 79% were undertaken for neoplastic processes. Tumor size was 3.5 cm for both approaches; R0 resections were achieved in all patients. Length of stay was similar in the two study groups (5 vs 4 days). There was one 30-day readmission after robotic surgery. CONCLUSIONS Patient outcomes are similar with LESS or robotic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. Robotic operations require more time in the operating room. Both are safe and efficacious minimally invasive operations that follow similar oncologic principles for similar tumors, and both should be in the surgeon's armamentarium for distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy.","Ryan, Carrie E; Ross, Sharona B; Sukharamwala, Prashant B; Sadowitz, Benjamin D; Wood, Thomas W; Rosemurgy, Alexander S",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2014.00246; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25848192/,223

60750,Epidemic plateau in critical susceptible-infected-removed dynamics with nontrivial initial conditions.,2020-11-01,"Background: It is twenty years since the US Institute of Medicine (IOM) defined quality in healthcare, as comprising six domains: person-centredness, timeliness, efficiency, effectiveness, safety and equity. Since then, a new quality movement has emerged, with the development of numerous interventions aimed at improving quality, with a focus on accessibility, safety and effectiveness of care. Further gains in equity and timeliness have proven even more challenging. The challenge: With the emergence of ""service-oriented"" systems, complexity science, the challenges of climate change, the growth of social media and the internet and the new reality of COVID-19, the original domains proposed by the IOM invite reflection on their relevance and possibility for improvement. The possible solution: In this paper, we propose a revised model of quality that is built on never-ending learning and includes new domains, such as Ecology and Transparency, which reflect the changing worldview of healthcare. We also introduce the concept of person- or ""kin-centred care"" to emphasise the shared humanity of people involved in the interdependent work. The change of Person Centred Care to Kin Centred Care introduces a broader concept of the person and ensures that Person Centred Care is included in every domain of quality rather than as a separate domain. The concentration on the technological aspects of quality is an example of the problem in the past. This is a more expansive view of what ""person-centredness"" began. The delivery of health and healthcare requires people working in differing roles, with explicit attention to the lived realities of the people in the roles of professional and patient. The new model will provide a construct that may make the attainment of equity in healthcare more possible with a focus on kindness for all.","Lachman, Peter; Batalden, Paul; Vanhaecht, Kris",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.26368.3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34158927/,223

61676,The people behind the papers - Kayt Scott and Bruce Appel.,2020-08-27,"BACKGROUND Clinical guidelines exhort clinicians to encourage patients to improve their health behaviours. However, most offer little support on how to have these conversations in practice. Clinicians fear that health behaviour change talk will create interactional difficulties and discomfort for both clinician and patient. This review aims to identify how healthcare professionals can best communicate with patients about health behaviour change (HBC). METHODS We included studies which used conversation analysis or discourse analysis to study recorded interactions between healthcare professionals and patients. We followed an aggregative thematic synthesis approach. This involved line-by-line coding of the results and discussion sections of included studies, and the inductive development and hierarchical grouping of descriptive themes. Top-level themes were organised to reflect their conversational positioning. RESULTS Of the 17,562 studies identified through systematic searching, ten papers were included. Analysis resulted in 10 top-level descriptive themes grouped into three domains: initiating; carrying out; and closing health behaviour change talk. Of three methods of initiation, two facilitated further discussion, and one was associated with outright resistance. Of two methods of conducting behaviour change talk, one was associated with only minimal patient responses. One way of closing was identified, and patients did not seem to respond to this positively. Results demonstrated a series of specific conversational practices which clinicians use when talking about HBC, and how patients respond to these. Our results largely complemented clinical guidelines, providing further detail on how they can best be delivered in practice. However, one recommended practice - linking a patient's health concerns and their health behaviours - was shown to receive variable responses and to often generate resistance displays. CONCLUSIONS Health behaviour change talk is smoothly initiated, conducted, and terminated by clinicians and this rarely causes interactional difficulty. However, initiating conversations by linking a person's current health concern with their health behaviour can lead to resistance to advice, while other strategies such as capitalising on patient initiated discussions, or collaborating through question-answer sequences, may be well received.","Albury, C; Hall, A; Syed, A; Ziebland, S; Stokoe, E; Roberts, N; Webb, H; Aveyard, P",BMC family practice,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-019-0992-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31376830/,223

STUDY DESIGN Experimental in vitro study. ANIMALS Jejunal sections from adult horses (n = 5) without gastrointestinal disease. METHODS Jejunal end-to-end anastomoses (n = 9) were performed for each group (V-Loc™, Biosyn™) with a continuous Lembert pattern with an interruption every 120°. Anastomosis construction time, luminal diameter, and number of suture bites were recorded. Anastomosis constructs were distended with fluid at 1 L/min until failure. Location and intraluminal pressure at failure were recorded and all measurements were compared between groups. RESULTS V-Loc™ anastomoses were significantly faster to perform (13.1 ± 0.35 minutes) when compared to the Biosyn™ group (15.6 ± 0.72 minutes; P = .0004). No differences were observed for anastomotic index or number of suture bites. V-Loc™ anastomosis constructs had a significantly decreased bursting pressure (160 ± 11.6 mmHg) compared to Biosyn™ constructs (184 ± 16.9 mmHg; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS V-Loc™ allowed faster construction time and did not cause a decreased anastomosis luminal diameter when compared with Biosyn™. V-Loc™ had a decreased bursting strength compared with Biosyn™, albeit well above pathologic pressures encountered clinically. Use of V-Loc™ may be beneficial for decreasing the amount of exposed suture material because of the absence of knots after construction and has the potential to result in decreased adhesions.","Nelson, Brad B; Hassel, Diana M",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950x.2013.12081.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24256315/,223
63797,Language matters in a pandemic.,2020-11-01,"The lungs are the primary organs affected in LHD (left heart disease). Increased left atrial pressure leads to pulmonary alveolar-capillary stress failure, resulting in cycles of alveolar wall injury and repair. The reparative process causes the proliferation of MYFs (myofibroblasts) with fibrosis and extracellular matrix deposition, resulting in thickening of the alveolar wall. Although the resultant reduction in vascular permeability is initially protective against pulmonary oedema, the process becomes maladaptive causing a restrictive lung syndrome with impaired gas exchange. This pathological process may also contribute to PH (pulmonary hypertension) due to LHD. Few clinical trials have specifically evaluated lung structural remodelling and the effect of related therapies in LHD. Currently approved treatment for chronic HF (heart failure) may have direct beneficial effects on lung structural remodelling. In the future, novel therapies specifically targeting the remodelling processes may potentially be utilized. In the present review, we summarize data supporting the clinical importance and pathophysiological mechanisms of lung structural remodelling in LHD and propose that this pathophysiological process should be explored further in pre-clinical studies and future therapeutic trials.","Azarbar, Sayena; Dupuis, Jocelyn",Clinical science,https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20130296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24678967/,223

Current convention does not address these challenges well. The goals of this pilot study were to determine whether computational modeling improves flow-diverter sizing over current convention and to validate simulated deployments. MATERIALS AND METHODS Seven experienced neurosurgeons and interventional neuroradiologists used computational modeling to prospectively plan 19 clinical interventions. In each patient case, physicians simulated 2-4 flow-diverter sizes that were under consideration based on preprocedural imaging. In addition, physicians identified a preferred device size using the current convention. A questionnaire on the impact of computational modeling on the procedure was completed immediately after treatment. Rotational angiography image data were acquired after treatment and compared with flow-diverter simulations to validate the output of the software platform. RESULTS According to questionnaire responses, physicians found the simulations useful for treatment planning, and they increased their confidence in device selection in 94.7% of cases. After viewing the simulations results, physicians selected a device size that was different from the original conventionally planned device size in 63.2% of cases. The average absolute difference between clinical and simulated flow-diverter lengths was 2.1 mm.

66190,Covid-19 treatment hope derived from llamas.,2021-10-01,"Online gambling has significantly altered the situational and structural characteristics of gambling products, to the extent that online gamblers might be substantially different from traditional offline gamblers. A growing body of literature has identified the evolving features of online gambling and the individuals who engage in it. However, beyond understanding the individual characteristics of this subgroup, relatively less effort has been made to examine whether existing cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) approaches are still entirely relevant for online problem gamblers, or whether changes are needed to adapt according to gambling mode of access. To understand what kind of challenges online gambling poses to mental health professionals dealing with disordered gamblers, four focus groups comprising 28 Spanish participants were carried out. All the treatment providers had ongoing experience with online gamblers undergoing treatment, and included clinical psychologists, mental health social workers, and a medical doctor. The data were examined using thematic analysis. The analysis identified five main themes that characterised online gamblers: (1) being of younger age, (2) lack of conflicts at home and at work/educational centre, rarely presenting violent or aggressive behaviour, (3) gambling disorder only being identified by overdue debt, (4) co-occurring conditions with technology-related abuse rather than other substance-related addictions, and (5) skill-based gambling. The study highlights mental health workers' perceived insecurities about how to best treat online gamblers, and discusses the specific characteristics that CBT for gambling disorder might need to incorporate to adjust for this particular group of gamblers.","Lopez-Gonzalez, Hibai; Jimenez-Murcia, Susana; Rius-Buitrago, Alicia; Griffiths, Mark D",Journal of gambling studies,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10899-021-10064-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34655397/,223

A central issue is to govern the multidimensional anisotropic space that defines these microparticle attributes. However, this control is limited to one or few dimensions due to profound fabrication tradeoffs, a problem that is exacerbated by miniaturization. Here, a vast number of anisotropic dimensions are integrated combining SU-8 photolithography with (bio)chemical modifications via soft-lithography. Microparticles in a 15-D anisotropic space are demonstrated, covering branching, faceting, fiducial, topography, size, aspect ratio, stiffness, (bio)molecular and quantum dot printing, top/bottom surface coverage, and quasi-0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D surface patterning. The strategy permits controlled miniaturization on physical dimensions below 1 µm and molecular patterns below 1 µm2 . By combining building blocks, anisotropic microparticles detect pH changes, form the basis for a DNA-assay recognition platform, and obtain an extraordinary volumetric barcoding density up to 1093 codes µm-3 in a 3 × 12 × 0.5 µm3 volume.","Agusil, Juan Pablo; Arjona, María Isabel; Duch, Marta; Fusté, Naüm; Plaza, José A",Small,https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202004691; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079486/,223

OBJECTIVES to propose an analysis strategy to ascertain the non-random nature of the spatial spread of COVID-19 cases infection and identify any territorial aggregations, in order to enhance contact tracing activities in specific areas of the Lazio Region (Central Italy) and a large urban area as Rome. METHODS all cases of COVID-19 of the Lazio Region notified to the Regional Service for Epidemiology, Surveillance, and Control of Infectious Diseases (Seresmi) with daily updates from the beginning of the epidemic to April 27, 2020 were considered. The analyses were carried out considering two periods (the first from the beginning of the epidemic to April 6 and the second from the beginning of the epidemic to April 27) and two different levels of spatial aggregation: the entire Lazio region excluding the Municipality of Rome, where the 377 municipalities represent the area units, and the Municipality of Rome, where the area units under study are the 155 urban areas (ZUR). The Scan statistic of Kulldorff was used to ascertain the non-random nature of the spatial spread of infected cases and to identify any territorial aggregations of cases of COVID-19 infection, using a retrospective spatial analysis in two overlapping periods. RESULTS analysis was conducted at regional level in the two survey periods and revealed the presence of 7 localized clusters. In the Municipality of Rome, a single cluster (Historic Centre) was identified in the first period which includes 7 urban areas, while in the second period two distinct clusters (Omo and Farnesina) were observed. CONCLUSIONS Scan statistics are an important surveillance tool for monitoring disease outbreaks during the active phase of the epidemic and a useful contribution to epidemiological surveillance during the COVID-19 epidemic in a specific territory.","Badaloni, Chiara; Asta, Federica; Michelozzi, Paola; Mataloni, Francesca; Di Rosa, Enrico; Scognamiglio, Paola; Vairo, Francesco; Davoli, Marina; Leone, Michela",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,https://doi.org/10.19191/ep20.5-6.s2.113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412805/,223

Surgical approaches vary substantially with little data on efficacy and safety. OBJECTIVE Summarize the literature on HS surgery with regards to patient characteristics, surgical approaches, and study quality. Compare postsurgical recurrence rates with a meta-analysis. METHODS PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched for studies on surgical HS management published after 2004. A random effects meta-analysis of recurrence rates was performed on eligible studies. RESULTS Of 715 identified studies, 59 were included in the review and 33 in the meta-analysis. Twenty-two studies of wide excision had the lowest pooled recurrence rate at 8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2%-16%); local excision had the highest at 34% (95% CI 24%-44%). For studies of wide/radical excision, flap repair had the lowest pooled recurrence rate at 0% (95% CI 0%-4%); delayed primary closure had the highest at 38% (95% CI 20%-59%). CONCLUSIONS Wide excision and flap-based reconstruction are associated with a lower postsurgical HS recurrence, although this must be balanced against potentially higher morbidity of extensive procedures.

67447,Are COVID vaccination programmes working? Scientists seek first clues.,2021-01-22,"BACKGROUND Recent data show that some patients will have insufficient weight loss or experience weight regain after sleeve gastrectomy. Dilation of the sleeve over time or use of an inadequate technique may contribute to relapse of morbid obesity. Repeat sleeve gastrectomy is the most obvious option but requires stapling of scarred tissue, has a higher risk of leakage, and is prone to re-enlargement with time. We herein describe a simple and innovative technique with which to revise vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) into functional single-anastomosis gastric bypass (f-SAGB). MATERIALS AND METHODS Twelve VSGs were converted to f-SAGB by placing a GaBP Ring (Bariatec Corp., Palos Verdes Peninsula, CA, USA) at the base of the ""sleeve"" and performing the anastomosis above the ring. The length of the biliopancreatic loop was chosen according to the volume of the pouch and the patient's residual eating capability. RESULTS All procedures were completed by laparoscopy and were uneventful. The average decrease in the body mass index was from 41.0 to 29.5 kg/m2 at the 12-month follow-up. No ring-related complications were reported. CONCLUSION f-SAGB is a low-risk and effective option with which to revise VSG in patients with inadequate weight loss. Avoiding detachment of the pouch from the antrum assures full reversibility of the procedure and preserves the chance to explore the remnant stomach and biliary tree.","Greco, Francesco",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-016-2392-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27704339/,223
68509,No use in shouting.,2021-01-15,"BACKGROUND Endovascular interventions are increasingly utilized in managing occlusive peripheral vascular disease. Angioplasty and stenting remain the mainstay of endovascular management; however, newer treatment modalities such as excisional atherectomy provide the clinician with additional treatment options. While demonstrating promising results in available trials, a paucity of data exist regarding peripheral atherectomy. The purpose of this retrospective clinical study was to assess the efficacy and safety of excisional atherectomy with the TurboHawk atherectomy device (Covidien/ev3, Plymouth, MN, USA) in the treatment of lower limb peripheral vascular disease and to evaluate the learning curve involved in the institution of a new treatment modality. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients undergoing atherectomy for symptomatic lower limb peripheral vascular disease by a single clinician between November 2011 and June 2013. Forty-seven vessels on 28 legs in 24 patients were treated during the period. RESULTS Atherectomy was possible in 98% of cases. The 6- and 12-month primary patency was 72.6 and 58.9%, respectively. The primary-assisted patency was 93.2% at 6 months and 74.6% at 12 months. There were significantly greater patency rates in the TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus A + B lesions and a non-significant trend towards improved patency rates in claudicants versus critical limb ischaemia. There were four instances of embolization and four cases of dissection. CONCLUSION Excisional atherectomy provides a further option for the minimally invasive management of peripheral vascular disease. It has similar patency rates to established endovascular therapies and should be considered among the treatment options in patients with favourable pathology.","Werner-Gibbings, Keagan; Dubenec, Steven",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.12897; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25366124/,223

The effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on MS are not known. The aim of this study was to understand the impact of COVID-19 on new and pre-existing symptoms of MS. METHODS The COVID-19 and MS study is an ongoing community-based, prospective cohort study conducted as part of the United Kingdom MS Register. People with MS and COVID-19 were invited by email to complete a questionnaire about their MS symptoms during the infection. An MS exacerbation was defined as developing new MS symptoms and/or worsening of pre-existing MS symptoms. RESULTS Fifty-seven percent (230/404) of participants had an MS exacerbation during their infection; 82 developed new MS symptoms, 207 experienced worsened pre-existing MS symptoms, and 59 reported both. Disease modifying therapies (DMTs) reduced the likelihood of developing new MS symptoms during the infection (OR 0.556, 95%CI 0.316-0.978).

68850,"Out of sight, out of mind.",2014,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness of prevention strategies to reduce future impact of low back pain (LBP), where impact is measured by LBP intensity and associated disability. DESIGN Systematic review with meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PEDro and The Cochrane (CENTRAL) databases from inception to 22 October 2018. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA RCTs evaluating any intervention aiming to prevent future impact of LBP, reporting an outcome measure of LBP intensity and/or disability measured at least 3 months post-randomisation, and the intervention group must be compared with a group that received no intervention/placebo or minimal intervention. Trials restricting recruitment to participants with current LBP were excluded. RESULTS 27 published reports of 25 different trials including a total of 8341 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The pooled results, from three RCTs (612 participants), found moderate-quality evidence that an exercise programme can prevent future LBP intensity (mean difference (MD) -4.50; 95% CI -7.26 to -1.74), and from 4 RCTs (471 participants) that an exercise and education programme can prevent future disability due to LBP (MD -6.28; 95% CI -9.51 to -3.06). It is uncertain whether prevention programmes improve future quality of life (QoL) and workability due to the overall low-quality and very low-quality available evidence. CONCLUSIONS This review provides moderate-quality evidence that an exercise programme, and a programme combining exercise and education, are effective to reduce future LBP intensity and associated disability. It is uncertain whether prevention programmes can improve future QoL and workability. Further high-quality RCTs evaluating prevention programmes aiming to reduce future impact of LBP are needed.","de Campos, Tarcisio F; Maher, Chris G; Fuller, Joel T; Steffens, Daniel; Attwell, Stephanie; Hancock, Mark J",British journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2019-101436; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32646887/,223
69095,Letter from Japan: Re-thinking our future.,2020-12-08,"Renal denervation transmits radiofrequency (RF) energy through an electrode to treat resistant hypertension (RH), applying ablation in the renal artery. Several experimental studies have shown that this treatment has been used effectively to treat RH. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of ablation parameters (i.e., electrode length, applied voltage, ablation time, and blood flow) on the temperature distribution using a balloon-based array electrodes system. A simplified three-dimensional model including four electrodes and a balloon was established. The balloon diameter was 3 mm and placed in a 5 mm diameter renal artery for forming intra-arterial occlusion. Four electrodes were mounted on the balloon and distributed in the same plane to mimic circumferential RF ablation. Computer simulations were conducted to investigate the thermal performances of the device by setting different electrode configurations, treatment protocols, and physiological factors. The thermal performances including the thermal distribution, maximum lesion depth, length, and area were analyzed. The lesion shape of the array RF electrodes was approximately a sphere with a 100% circumference coverage rate of the renal artery. The lesion depth and length increase with each factor except for blood velocity. Increasing the electrode length from 2 to 4 mm or 2 to 6 mm, the lesion depth increases by 1.15 mm and 0.54 mm at 60 s. The corresponding lesion length increases by 2.65 mm and 2.34 mm, respectively. The range of effective lesion depth is 1.90-4.90 mm, at a voltage of 15-30 V. But the peak temperature at the arterial outer wall exceeded 100 °C when the voltage is above 25 V. In tissue, the degree of thermal injury in the 2 mm area reached 100%, but in blood was not more than 5%. There was no significant difference at different flow conditions because the difference value in lesion depth was not exceeded 0.5 mm. The results showed that the balloon-based four electrodes system is expected to overcome the difficulty of incomplete ablation. In clinical application, 2 mm-electrode is recommended to avoid long wall damage as much as possible and control the voltage below 25 V. This treatment has little thermal injury on the blood, which means it may avoid coagulation formation. Moreover, the application of this device does not need to consider the difference in individual blood velocity.","Cheng, Yanyan; Liu, Hongxing; Tian, Zhen; Zhang, Meng; Liu, Youjun; Nan, Qun",Electromagnetic biology and medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/15368378.2021.1961266; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352188/,223
69941,A guide to R - the pandemic's misunderstood metric.,2020-07-03,"OBJECTIVES Intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after curative treatment occurs frequently and influences the prognoses. The aim of this study was to determine prognostic factors affecting survival after IDR and the optimum therapy for IDR. METHODS A total of 115 patients with a single small primary HCC who had complete radiofrequency (RF) ablation were enrolled in this study. The prognostic factors and the optimum therapy affecting survival were statistically analyzed among patients with IDRs. RESULTS IDRs were observed in 59 (51.3%) patients with the median observation period of 19.6 months. The cumulative rates of IDRs were 11.8, 53.9, and 75.8% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. IDR nodules were present as a single nodule in 38 patients and as multiple nodules in 21 patients. In all, 23 patients died during the follow-up. A total of 30 patients were treated with RF ablation, and 27 were treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). The overall cumulative survival rates after IDRs were 92.7, 55.4, and 43.7% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. A multivariate analysis showed that treatment with RF ablation for IDR was a significant favorable prognostic factor after IDR (hazard ratio: 0.167, 95% confidence interval: 0.048-0.584, P=0.005). In a comparison of survival after IDR between patients treated with RF ablation and TACE, who were comparable with clinical and tumoral characteristics, the cumulative survival rate of patients treated with RF ablation was significantly higher than that of those treated with TACE (77.2 vs 28.5% at 3 years). The cumulative survival rates obtained from the initial RF ablation of the patients with IDRs treated with repeat RF ablation were similar to those of recurrence-free patients. CONCLUSIONS Repeat RF ablation should be attempted for IDR as much as possible despite tumor multiplicity for survival benefit; by reducing the need, it will help solve the problem of the current shortage of donors for liver transplantations.","Okuwaki, Yusuke; Nakazawa, Takahide; Kokubu, Shigehiro; Hidaka, Hisashi; Tanaka, Yoshiaki; Takada, Juichi; Watanabe, Masaaki; Shibuya, Akitaka; Minamino, Tsutomu; Saigenji, Katsunori",The American journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2009.414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19603009/,223
70231,The Sustainable Path to a Circular Bioeconomy.,2020-11-25,"BACKGROUND Acute exacerbation (AE) is recognized as a life-threatening condition with acute respiratory worsening in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). AE also occurs in fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) other than IPF, including other types of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs), ILD associated with collagen vascular disease (CVD-ILD) and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonia (CHP). However, the clinical impact after AE in those patients is still unclear. METHODS A retrospective review of 174 consecutive first-episodes with AE of ILD in our institution from 2002 to 2016 was performed. AE was defined according to the revised definition and diagnostic criteria proposed by an international working group in 2016. Clinical characteristics, 90-day survival, and the requirement of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) after AE were evaluated in each underlying ILD. RESULTS There were 102 patients with AE of IPF (AE-IPF) and 72 with AE of ILD other than IPF, including non-IPF IIPs (n=29) and secondary ILD (n=43) [CVD-ILD (n=39), CHP (n=4)]. In CVD-ILD, rheumatoid arthritis (n=17) was most common. The 90-day mortality after AE was 57% in IPF, 29% in non-IPF IIPs, and 33% in secondary ILD. After AE, ILD other than IPF had a significantly better survival rate than IPF (P<0.001). Among survivors, the rates of patients requiring LTOT after AE were 63% in IPF, 35% in non-IPF IIPs, and 46% in secondary ILD, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AE of ILD other than IPF might have a better prognosis than AE-IPF, but both are fatal conditions that cause chronic respiratory failure.","Miyashita, Koichi; Kono, Masato; Saito, Go; Koyanagi, Yu; Tsutsumi, Akari; Kobayashi, Takeshi; Miki, Yoshihiro; Hashimoto, Dai; Nakamura, Yutaro; Suda, Takafumi; Nakamura, Hidenori",The clinical respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/crj.13304; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197284/,223

METHODS The study was carried out on a selected group of 60 healthy subjects. All subjects were trained to voice a vocal sample of a sustained /a/, at a conversational voice intensity for the Maximum Phonation Time (MPT), wearing the surgical mask and then without wearing the surgical mask. Voice samples were recorded directly in Praat. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences in any acoustic parameter between the masked and unmasked condition. There was a non-significant decrease in vocal intensity in 65% of the subjects while wearing a surgical mask. CONCLUSIONS The statistical comparison carried out between all the acoustic voice parameters observed, extracted wearing and not wearing a surgical mask did not reveal any significant statistical difference. Most of the subjects, after wearing the surgical mask, presented a decrease in vocal intensity measured. Our conclusion was that wearing a mask is likely to induce the unconscious need to increase the vocal effort, resulting over time in a greater risk of developing functional dysphonia. The reduction of intensity can affect also social interaction and speech audibility, especially for individuals with hearing loss.","Fiorella, Maria Luisa; Cavallaro, Giada; Di Nicola, Vincenzo; Quaranta, Nicola",Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvoice.2021.01.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33712355/,223

We conducted a rapid review to determine how sexual wellbeing has been defined, qualitatively explored and quantitatively measured. Eligible studies selected for inclusion from OVID Medline, PsychInfo, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL were: in English language, published after 2007, were peer-reviewed full articles, focused on sexual wellbeing (or proxies for, e.g. satisfaction, function), and quantitatively or qualitatively assessed sexual wellbeing. We included studies with participants aged 16-65. Given study heterogeneity, our synthesis and findings are reported using a narrative approach. We identified 162 papers, of which 10 offered a definition of sexual wellbeing. Drawing upon a socio-ecological model, we categorised the 59 dimensions we identified from studies under three main domains: cognitive-affect (31 dimensions); inter-personal (22 dimensions); and socio-cultural (6 dimensions). Only 11 papers were categorised under the socio-cultural domain, commonly focusing on gender inequalities or stigma. We discuss the importance of conceptualising sexual wellbeing as individually experienced but socially and structurally influenced, including assessing sexual wellbeing freedom: a person's freedom to achieve sexual wellbeing, or their real opportunities and liberties.","Lorimer, Karen; DeAmicis, Leyla; Dalrymple, Jenny; Frankis, Jamie; Jackson, Louise; Lorgelly, Paula; McMillan, Lesley; Ross, Jonathan",Journal of sex research,https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2019.1635565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31335208/,223

Previously, the test has been strictly controlled to minimize the introduction of extraneous, nonspectro-temporal cues. Here, the effect of relaxing many of those controls was investigated to ascertain the generalizability of the STRIPES test. Preemphasis compensation was removed from the STRIPES stimuli, the test was presented over a loudspeaker at a level similar to conversational speech and above the automatic gain control threshold of the CI processor, and listeners were tested using the everyday setting of their clinical devices. There was no significant difference in STRIPES thresholds measured across conditions for the 10 CI listeners tested. One listener obtained higher (better) thresholds when listening with their clinical processor. An analysis of longitudinal results showed excellent test-retest reliability of STRIPES over multiple listening sessions with similar conditions. Overall, the results show that the STRIPES test is robust to extraneous cues, and that thresholds are reliable over time. It is sufficiently robust for use with different processing strategies, free-field presentation, and in nonresearch settings.","Archer-Boyd, Alan W; Goehring, Tobias; Carlyon, Robert P",Trends in hearing,https://doi.org/10.1177/2331216520964281; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305696/,223
76024,The role of analytical reasoning and source credibility on the evaluation of real and fake full-length news articles.,2021-03-31,"BACKGROUND In patients presenting with acute diverticulitis (AD) and signs of acute peritonitis, the presence of extradigestive air (EDA) on a computer tomography (CT) scan is often considered to indicate the need for emergency surgery. Although the traditional management of ""perforated"" AD is open sigmoidectomy, more recently, laparoscopic drainage/lavage (usually followed by delayed elective sigmoidectomy) has been reported. The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the results of nonoperative management of emergency patients presenting with AD and EDA. METHODS The outcomes of 39 consecutive hemodynamically stable patients (23 men, mean age = 54.7 years) who were admitted with AD and EDA and were managed nonoperatively (antibiotic and supportive treatment) at a tertiary-care university hospital between January 2001 and June 2010 were retrospectively collected and analyzed. These included morbidity (Clavien-Dindo) and treatment failure (need for emergency surgery or death). A univariate analysis of clinical, radiological, and laboratory criteria with respect to treatment failure was performed. Results of delayed elective laparoscopic sigmoidectomy were also analyzed. RESULTS There was no mortality. Thirty-six of the 39 patients (92.3%) did not need surgery (7 patients required CT-guided abscess drainage). Mean hospital stay was 8.1 days. Duration of symptoms, previous antibiotic administration, severe sepsis, PCR level, WBC concentration, and the presence of abdominal collection were associated with treatment failure, whereas ""distant"" location of EDA and free abdominal fluid were not. Five patients had recurrence of AD and were treated medically. Seventeen patients (47.2%) underwent elective laparoscopic sigmoidectomy for which mean operative time was 246 min (range = 100-450) and the conversion rate was 11.8%. Mortality was nil and the morbidity rate was 41.2%. Mean postoperative stay was 7.1 days (range = 4-23). CONCLUSIONS Nonoperative management is a viable option in most emergency patients presenting with AD and EDA, even in the presence of symptoms of peritonitis or altered laboratory tests. Delayed laparoscopic sigmoidectomy may be useless in certain cases and its results poorer than expected.","Costi, Renato; Cauchy, François; Le Bian, Alban; Honart, Jean-François; Creuze, Nicolas; Smadja, Claude",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2157-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22274929/,223
76325,Artificial Intelligence in PET: An Industry Perspective.,2021-08-03,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS), which uses electrical stimulation, is a well-established neurosurgical technique used to treat neurological disorders. Despite its broad therapeutic use, the effects of electrical stimulation on brain cells is not fully understood. Here, we examine the effects of electrical stimulation on neural stem and progenitor cells (collectively neural precursor cells; NPCs) C57BLJ/6 mice found in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult forebrain. Previous work has demonstrated that adult-derived NPCs are electro-sensitive and undergo rapid and directed migration in response to application of clinically relevant electric fields. We examine NPC proliferation kinetics and their differentiation profile following electric field application using in vitro and in vivo assays. In vitro direct current electrical stimulation of 250 mV/mm is sufficient to elicit a 2-fold increase in the neural stem cell pool and increases neurogenesis and oligogenesis. In vivo, asymmetric biphasic electrical stimulation similarly increases the size of the NPC pool and alters neurogenesis. These findings provide insight into the effects of electrical stimulation on NPCs and suggest its potential use as a regenerative approach to neural repair.Significance Statement Electrical stimulation promotes neural precursor cell migration. In this study we demonstrate that electrical stimulation in addition to cell migration can also expand the size of the NPC pool and enhance neurogenesis, both in vitro and in vivo Using electrical stimulation to activate neural stem cells could be a powerful tool to promote tissue repair.","Sefton, Elana; Iwasa, Stephanie N; Morrison, Taylor; Naguib, Hani E; Popovic, Milos R; Morshead, Cindi M",eNeuro,https://doi.org/10.1523/eneuro.0273-20.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719101/,223
76682,China can help solve the debt and environmental crises.,2021-01-29,"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) has become one of the most commonly performed bariatric procedures, largely due to several advantages it carries over more complex bariatric procedures. LSG is generally considered a straightforward procedure, but one of the major concerns is a staple line leak. OBJECTIVE The objectives of this study are to evaluate the correlation between surgeon's experience and leak rate and to assess the different risk factors for developing a gastric leak after LSG. SETTING Private hospital, France. METHODS The analysis of a single surgeon's yearly leak rate since the introduction of LSG for possible risk factors was done. RESULTS A total of 2012 LSGs were performed in between September, 2005 and December, 2014. Twenty cases (1 %) of gastric leak were recorded. Of these, 17 patients were women (94.4 %) with a mean age of 39.4 years (range 22-61) and mean body mass index (BMI) 41.2 kg/m(2) (range 34.8-57.1). On a yearly basis, the leak rate was 4.8 % (2006), 5.7 % (2007), 0 (2008), 2.6 % (2009), 2 % (2010), 0.8 % (2011), 0.6 % (2012), 0.2 % (2013), and 0 (2014). In the first 1000 cases (group A), there were 18 cases of gastric leak and in the last 1000 cases, there were 800 with GORE® SEAMGUARD® Bioabsorbable Staple Line Reinforcement (group B) 2 cases of gastric leak (p = 0.009). A revisional LSG, 395 patients after gastric banding and 61 patients re-sleeve gastrectomy, was performed in 456 cases (22.7 %). There were 3 cases of leak (0.65 %). There were two deaths. CONCLUSION LSG can be performed with a low complication rate. This large series of a single surgeon's experience demonstrated that the leak rate after LSG could be significantly decreased over time with changes in techniques.","Noel, Patrick; Nedelcu, Marius; Gagner, Michel",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-015-2003-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26712495/,223

MATERIALS AND METHODS Twelve patients underwent femoral cerebral angiography to visualize the extent of vascular malformation. Before the surgical procedures, surgical sites were devascularized by direct injection of hemostatic or embolic agents. Direct puncture sclerotherapy at the base of surgical sites was performed using Surgiflo or n-butylcyanoacrylate glue. Surgical procedures were carried out in routine fashion. A hemostatic packing of FloSeal, Gelfoam, and Avitene was adapted to the surgical sites. RESULTS Direct puncture sclerotherapy with Surgiflo or n-butylcyanoacrylate glue resulted in minimal blood loss intraoperatively. Local application of the FloSeal, Gelfoam, and Avitene packing sustained hemostasis and produced excellent healing postoperatively. CONCLUSION Patients with arteriovenous malformations can safely undergo routine oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures with minimal blood loss when appropriate endovascular techniques and local hemostatic measures are used by the interventional radiologist and oral and maxillofacial surgeon.","Karim, Abdul Basit; Lindsey, Sean; Bovino, Brian; Berenstein, Alejandro",Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2015.10.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26549473/,223
77116,2020 beyond COVID: the other science events that shaped the year.,2020-12-01,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE The COVID-19 pandemic causes vital concerns due to the lack of proved, effective, and safe therapy. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine seem to be useful, but recently serious concerns regarding their adverse events have risen. The aim of the study was to broaden the general perspective of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine use in COVID-19 treatment, based on an analysis of their current safety profile among patients with rheumatic diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study was based on a group of 152 patients with rheumatic diseases, aged 20-78 years, treated either with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Analyzed data included age, gender, comorbidities, type of drug, dosage, treatment duration, and reported adverse events. Cases of drug withdrawal related to adverse events were also recorded. RESULTS The dosage was consistent in both groups: 250 mg of chloroquine or 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily. 77.6% of patients did not experience any adverse reactions to the treatment. Hydroxychloroquine showed better safety profile, with 10.9% of patients reporting side-ffects, compared to 28.9% in patients treated with chloroquine. The overall incidence of ophthalmic complications was 6.6%. For both drugs, no statistically significant correlation between adverse events and age, chronic heart or liver disease, or hypertension was found. CONCLUSIONS Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine at lower doses, as used in rheumatic diseases, prove to be relatively safe. Data from the literature show that high dosage as recommended in COVID-19 treatment may pose a risk of toxicity and require precise management, but prophylactic, long-term use of lower, safe doses might be a promising solution.","Majewski, Dominik; Majewska, Katarzyna Anna; Naskręcka, Monika; Grygiel-Górniak, Bogna",Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,https://doi.org/10.26444/aaem/127766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33775077/,223

Cytokine release as a consequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection may precipitate the onset of metabolic alterations by affecting glucose homeostasis. Here we describe abnormalities in glycometabolic control, insulin resistance and beta cell function in patients with COVID-19 without any pre-existing history or diagnosis of diabetes, and document glycaemic abnormalities in recovered patients 2 months after onset of disease. In a cohort of 551 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Italy, we found that 46% of patients were hyperglycaemic, whereas 27% were normoglycaemic. Using clinical assays and continuous glucose monitoring in a subset of patients, we detected altered glycometabolic control, with insulin resistance and an abnormal cytokine profile, even in normoglycaemic patients. Glycaemic abnormalities can be detected for at least 2 months in patients who recovered from COVID-19. Our data demonstrate that COVID-19 is associated with aberrant glycometabolic control, which can persist even after recovery, suggesting that further investigation of metabolic abnormalities in the context of long COVID is warranted.","Montefusco, Laura; Ben Nasr, Moufida; D'Addio, Francesca; Loretelli, Cristian; Rossi, Antonio; Pastore, Ida; Daniele, Giuseppe; Abdelsalam, Ahmed; Maestroni, Anna; Dell'Acqua, Marco; Ippolito, Elio; Assi, Emma; Usuelli, Vera; Seelam, Andy Joe; Fiorina, Roberta Maria; Chebat, Enrica; Morpurgo, Paola; Lunati, Maria Elena; Bolla, Andrea Mario; Finzi, Giovanna; Abdi, Reza; Bonventre, Joseph V; Rusconi, Stefano; Riva, Agostino; Corradi, Domenico; Santus, Pierachille; Nebuloni, Manuela; Folli, Franco; Zuccotti, Gian Vincenzo; Galli, Massimo; Fiorina, Paolo",Nature metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-021-00407-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035524/,223

MATERIALS AND METHODS Nine New Zealand White rabbits were used to surgically implant VX2 liver tumors. During ultrasound-guided RF ablation, tumors received either a true or sham ablation. After selective catheterization of the left hepatic artery under x-ray fluoroscopy, we acquired pre- and post-RF ablation 4D TRIP MR images using 3 mL of 2.5% intraarterial gadopentetate dimeglumine. Two regions-of-interest were drawn upon each tumor to generate signal-intensity time curves. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to provide semiquantitative perfusion measurements that were compared using a paired t-test (α = 0.05). Ablated tissue was visually confirmed on pathology using Evans blue dye. RESULTS Mean AUC perfusion of VX2 tumors for the true ablation group decreased by 92.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 83.3%-100%), from 1913 (95% CI: 1557, 2269) before RF ablation to 76.6 (95% CI: 18.4, 134.8) after RF ablation (a.u., P < 0.001). Sham-ablated tumors demonstrated no significant perfusion changes. CONCLUSION 4D TRIP MRI can quantify liver tumor perfusion reductions in VX2 rabbits after RF ablation. This MRI technique can potentially be used to improve tumor response assessment at the time of RF ablation.","Sato, Kent T; Wang, Dingxin; Lewandowski, Robert J; Ryu, Robert K; Klein, Rachel A; Salem, Riad; Larson, Andrew C; Omary, Reed A",Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.22644; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21761464/,223

METHODS We compared opioid prescriptions, clinical outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes among 273 women. Post-discharge symptom burden was collected up to 42 days after discharge using the validated 27-item MD Anderson Symptom Inventory and analyzed using linear mixed effects models and Kaplan-Meier curves for symptom recovery. RESULTS Among 113 pre-implementation and 160 post-implementation patients there was no difference in opioid refills (9.7% vs 11.3%, p=0.84). The post-implementation cohort had a significant reduction in median morphine equivalent dose (112.5 mg vs 225 mg, p<0.01), with no difference in median hospital length of stay (3 days vs 3 days, p=1.0) or 30-day readmission rate (9.4% vs 7.1%, p=0.66). There was no difference in patient-reported pain between the pre- and post-implementation cohorts on the day of discharge (severity 4.93 vs 5.14, p=0.53) or in any patient-reported symptoms, interference measures, or composite scores by post-discharge day 7. The median recovery time for most symptoms was 7 days, except for pain (14 days), fatigue (18 days), and physical interference (21 days), with no differences between cohorts. CONCLUSIONS After implementation of a tiered opioid prescribing algorithm, the quantity and dose of discharge opioids prescribed decreased with no change in post-operative refills and without negatively impacting patient-reported symptom burden or interference, which can be used to educate and reassure patients and providers.","Huepenbecker, Sarah; Hillman, Robert Tyler; Iniesta, Maria D; Chen, Tsun; Cain, Katherine; Mena, Gabriel; Lasala, Javier; Wang, Xin Shelley; Williams, Loretta; Taylor, Jolyn S; Lu, Karen H; Ramirez, Pedro T; Meyer, Larissa A",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2021-002674; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34135073/,223

Although most patients have mild symptoms or are even asymptomatic, there are patients who can develop serious complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or venous thromboembolism requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care. Hence, it is important to identify patients with a higher risk of complications in a timely manner. Thus, the objective of this paper is to review the hematological laboratory parameters that consistently are altered in COVID-19 and to identify their relationship with the severity of the disease. According to 11 selected reports, the frequency of patients aged > 65 years is higher among subjects severely affected or deceased; likewise, males predominantly suffer from comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes or obesity. Retrospective studies have identified alterations in various hematological and inflammatory parameters as part of the host's response to infection and a secondary increased risk of different thrombotic events. Among these altered parameters, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 have been tested as prognostic biomarkers due to their close relationship with the severity of the disease. Actually, they can reliably indicate the use of antithrombotic therapy at prophylactic or therapeutic doses (mainly D-dimer), as has already been established in those patients who, after an individualized assessment, appear to be at high risk for thrombotic events.","Ornelas-Ricardo, Diana; Jaloma-Cruz, Ana Rebeca",The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1620/tjem.251.327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32788506/,223

This paper presents design components and rationale for constructing highly efficient trials to screen potential COVID-19 treatments. METHODS Key trial design elements useful in this circumstance include futility hypotheses, treatment pooling, reciprocal controls, ranking and selection, and platform administration. Assuming most of the many candidates for COVID-19 treatment are likely to be ineffective, these components can be combined to facilitate very efficient comparisons of treatments. RESULTS Simulations indicate such designs can reliably discard underperforming treatments using sample size to treatment ratios under 30.

METHOD We analysed the somatic mutations of whole exome sequencing data in 392 patient tumour and normal tissue pairs based on the corresponding blood samples across 10 tumour types. RESULTS Many of the mutations involved in oncogenic pathways such as PI3K, NOTCH and TP53, were identified in the normal tissues. The ageing-related mutational signature was the most prominent contributing signature found and the mutations in the normal tissues were frequently in genes involved in late replication time (p<0.0001). Variants were rarely overlapping across tissue types but shared variants between normal and matched tumour tissue were present. These shared variants were frequently pathogenic when compared with non-shared variants (p=0.001) and showed a higher variant-allele-fraction (p<0.0001). Normal tissue-specific mutated genes were frequently non-cancer-associated (p=0.009). PIK3CA mutations were identified in 6 normal tissues and were harboured by all of the matched cancer tissues. Multiple types of PIK3CA mutations were found in normal breast and matched cancer tissues. The PIK3CA mutations exclusively present in normal tissue may indicate clonal expansions unrelated to the tumour. In addition, PIK3CA mutation was appeared that they arose before the occurrence of the allelic imbalance.

As a component of pandemic response in the United States, efforts to develop, launch, and scale-up contact tracing initiatives are rapidly expanding, yet the presence of social work is noticeably absent. In this paper, we identify the specialized skill set necessary for high quality contact tracing in the COVID-19 era and explore its alignment with social work competencies and skills. Described are current examples of contact tracing efforts, and an argument for greater social work leadership, based on the profession's ethics, competencies and person-in-environment orientation is offered. In light of the dire need for widespread high-quality contact tracing, social work is well-positioned to participate in interprofessional efforts to design, oversee and manage highly effective front-line contact tracing efforts.","Ross, Abigail M; Zerden, Lisa De Saxe; Ruth, Betty J; Zelnick, Jennifer; Cederbaum, Julie",Social work in public health,https://doi.org/10.1080/19371918.2020.1806170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32781912/,223

84908,A High-Throughput and Machine Learning Resistance Monitoring System to Determine the Point of Resistance for Escherichia coli with tetracycline: Combining UV-Visible Spectrophotometry with Principal Component Analysis.,2021-01-05,"BACKGROUND The failure of some high-income countries to retain their medical graduates is one driver of doctor immigration from low- and middle-income countries. Ireland, which attracts many international medical graduates, implemented a doctor retention strategy from early 2015. This study measures junior doctors' migration intentions, the reasons they leave and likelihood of them returning. The aim is to identify the characteristics and patterns of doctors who plan to emigrate to inform targeted measures to retain these doctors. METHODS A national sample of 1148 junior hospital doctors completed an online survey in early 2018, eliciting their experiences of training and working conditions. Respondents were asked to choose between the following career options: remain in Ireland, go and return, go and stay away, or quit medicine. Bivariate analyses and a two-stage multivariable analysis were used to model the factors associated with these outcomes. RESULTS 45% of respondents planned to remain in Ireland, 35% leave but return later, 17% leave and not return; and 3% to quit medicine. An intention to go abroad versus remain in Ireland was independently associated (P<.05) with the doctor being under 30 years (odds ratio [OR]=1.09 per year under 30), a non-European Union (EU) national (OR=1.54), a trainee (OR=1.50), and with hospital specialization, especially in Anesthesiology (OR=5.09). Respondents were more likely to remain if they had experienced improvements in supervision and training costs. Intention to go abroad and not return versus go and return was independently associated (P<.05) with: age over 30 years (OR=1.16 per year over 30); being a non-EU (OR=9.85) or non-Irish EU (OR=3.42) national; having trained through a graduate entry pathway (OR=2.17), specializing in Psychiatry (OR=4.76) and reporting that mentoring had become worse (OR=5.85). CONCLUSION Ireland's doctor retention strategy has not addressed the root causes of poor training and working experiences in Irish hospitals. It needs a more diversified retention strategy that addresses under-staffing, facilitates circular migration by younger trainees who choose to train abroad, identifies and addresses specialty-specific factors, and builds mentoring linkages between trainees and senior specialists.","Brugha, Ruairi; Clarke, Nicholas; Hendrick, Louise; Sweeney, James",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.54; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32610753/,223
85439,Reduced water collection time improves learning achievement among primary school children in India.,2021-08-05,"BACKGROUND The study aim was to describe conditions seen 'out-of-hours' in equine practice. METHODS This was a retrospective case series of first opinion 'out-of-hours' cases seen at two equine practices between 2011 and 2013. Data were retrieved on case presentation, diagnostic testing, treatment administered and outcome, and diseases categorised using a systems-based coding system. A hierarchical logistic regression, formulated using a generalised linear model, was used to identify clinical variables associated with a binary outcome of 'critical' cases (required hospitalisation or euthanasia or died). RESULTS Data from 2602 cases were analysed. The most common reasons for 'out-of-hours' visits were colic (35 per cent, n=923/2620), wounds (20 per cent, n=511/2620) and lameness (11 per cent, n=288/2,620). The majority of cases required a single treatment (58 per cent, n=1475/2550), 26 per cent (n=656/2550) needed multiple treatments and 13 per cent (n=339/2550) were euthanased. Eighteen per cent (n=480/2602) of cases had a critical outcome. Increased heart rate at primary presentation was associated with critical outcome in both practices (Practice A, OR 1.07 (95 per cent confidence interval 1.06 to 1.09), Practice B OR 1.08 (95 per cent confidence interval 1.07 to 1.09; p<0.001)). CONCLUSION Colic, wounds and lameness were the most common equine 'out-of-hours' conditions; 13 per cent of cases were euthanased. Further research is required into out-of-hours euthanasia decision-making.","Bowden, Adelle; Boynova, Polina; Brennan, Marnie Louise; England, Gary C W; Mair, Tim S; Furness, Wendy A; Freeman, Sarah L; Burford, John H",The Veterinary record,https://doi.org/10.1136/vr.105880; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719083/,223
85536,Academia in Quarantine.,2020-08-04,"PURPOSE The safety and efficacy of reinforced staplers during distal pancreatectomy (DP) remain controversial because of the small sample size. This multicenter single-arm prospective study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of reinforced staplers with bioabsorbable material during DP. METHODS Between October 2014 and August 2015, 121 patients scheduled for DP were enrolled in this study at 11 institutions in Japan. The primary endpoint was the incidence of clinically relevant pancreatic fistula. Protocol treatment was defined as ""distal pancreatectomy using reinforced staplers."" RESULTS Per-protocol analysis of 105 patients was performed; 16 of the patients were excluded based on discontinuation of protocol treatment criteria. Clinically relevant pancreatic fistula occurred in 13 (12.4%) of 105 patients. The overall morbidity rate was 29.5% (31 of 105 patients) and severe complication (Clavien classification IIIa or more) was 10.5% (11/105). Mortality rate was 0%, although reoperations were performed on two patients (1.9%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis of independent risk factors for clinically relevant pancreatic fistula after DP using reinforced stapler closure was operative time more than 240 min (P = 0.047, odds ratio 5.79), registration numbers less than 10 (P = 0.046, odds ratio 13.01), and staple line hemorrhage (P = 0.003, odds ratio 16.34). CONCLUSION This study confirms the safety of reinforced staplers for pancreatic stump closure during DP. However, the efficacy of reinforced staplers for decreasing clinically relevant pancreatic fistula could not be drawn from this study.

85952,THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN DOMAIN-GENERAL AND DOMAIN-SPECIFIC MECHANISMS DURING THE TIME-COURSE OF VERBAL ASSOCIATIVE LEARNING: AN EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL STUDY.,2021-08-02,"BACKGROUND Conventional treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities by anticoagulation alone has been proven to be insufficient to prevent recurrence and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Early restoration of venous patency and preservation of valvular function by endovascular surgery has been advocated. The aim of this study was to review the efficacy and safety of percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) against catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) in the treatment of acute iliofemoral DVT. METHODS Three hundred sixty-nine articles were identified through screening of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases from January 2006 to December 2016. RESULTS Fifteen retrospective studies and one prospective registry, totalling 1170 patients, were recruited for qualitative synthesis. The venous patency rate ranged from 75% to 100% with mean follow-up of 12.3 months. The rates of PTS and recurrent DVT were less than 17% and 15%, respectively. The overall mortality rate was 0.26%. Compared with CDT, PMT was shown to reduce PTS at 1 year (Villalta score: 2.1 ± 3.0 in the PMT group and 5.1 ± 4.1 in the CDT group, P=0.03) and bleeding complications (packed cells transfused: 0.2 ± 0.3 units in the pharmacomechanical thrombectomy group and 1.2 ± 0.7 units in the CDT group, P<0.05). CONCLUSION Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy is a safe and effective treatment for acute iliofemoral DVT in terms of restoration of venous patency, prevention of DVT recurrence, and PTS. Compared with CDT alone, PMT offers a lower risk of PTS and bleeding complications.","Wong, P C; Chan, Y C; Law, Y; Cheng, S W K",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.12809/hkmj187491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30643038/,223
86253,Extended Lifetime In Vivo Pulse Stimulated Ultrasound Imaging.,2018,"BACKGROUND Development of cysts has been reported as a potential complication after surgical repositioning of nictitating membrane gland protrusion using the conjunctival pocket technique. To the authors' knowledge, no treatment for these cysts has ever been published. OBJECTIVES This short case series describes a surgical technique of marsupialization as a treatment option for these cysts and proposes a pathogenesis for cyst formation. CASES DESCRIPTION Three dogs were each referred for a unilateral subconjunctival mass-like lesion involving the bulbar side of the nictitating membrane. Complete ophthalmologic examination revealed a pink, translucent, soft, and nonpainful mass protruding from the bulbar surface of the nictitating membrane in all cases. Treatment consisted in marsupialization of the cyst on the palpebral surface of the nictitating membrane and was curative with no short-term postoperative complication and favorable long-term outcome for the three dogs. Histopathological findings were consistent with a lacrimal cyst. CONCLUSION Marsupialization appears to be a safe, simple, and effective treatment for nictitating membrane cyst secondary to surgical correction of gland prolapse using conjunctival pocket technique in dogs. Further studies on a larger number of cases are necessary to determine whether marsupialization is the technique of choice and to further investigate the pathophysiology of cyst formation after conjunctival pocket repositioning of prolapsed glands.","Barbé, Charlotte; Raymond-Letron, Isabelle; Mias, Guillaume-Pierre; Charron, Julien; Goulle, Frédéric",Veterinary ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1111/vop.12382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27098367/,223
87429,Getting back to normal.,2021-05-01,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The aim of this study was to provide a critical appraisal of the literature on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on organ transplantation, with a specific focus on lung transplantation given the predominant pulmonary involvement of the virus. RECENT FINDINGS There was a significant decrease in lung transplant volumes during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic due to a combination of reduced availability of donors and an imbalance between waitlist additions and inactivations. SARS-CoV-2 infection was subsequently associated with an exuberant immune response that can lead to the development of postinfectious fibrotic lung disease. Few lung transplants have been performed in previously infected recipients and long-term outcomes remain unknown. Although the lung transplant volume rebounded during the second wave, it is unclear what the long-term effects of healthcare resource limitation and public health measures will have on transplant volumes in the future. Outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection in previous lung transplant recipients appear to be worse than the general public, and, although an immunosuppressed state likely contributes to these outcomes, whether immunosuppression should be altered in those exposed to or infected with SARS-CoV-2 remains unanswered in the absence of unequivocal data. SUMMARY The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a number of challenges for lung transplant programs across the globe. Multiple research questions remain to be answered in order to optimally manage lung transplant recipients in the context of this pandemic.","Bery, Amit I; Kulkarni, Hrishikesh S; Kreisel, Daniel",Current opinion in organ transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/mot.0000000000000862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33651004/,223

88787,Daily briefing: First drug shown to reduce deaths among people seriously ill with COVID-19.,2020-06-16,"A pericyte-centered theory suggesting that embolisms occurring within the microvasculature of a neurovascular unit can result in either parenchymal hemorrhage or intravascular congestion is presented here. Dysfunctional microvascular pericytes are characterized by their location in the neurovascular unit, either on the arteriole or venule side. Pathophysiological and pathological changes caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include pulmonary hypertension, edema, focal hemorrhage, microvascular congestion, and thrombosis. In this paper, I have extended the application of the pericytes-centered hypothesis to COVID-19 by proposing the concept of a pulmonary neurovascular unit (pNVU); application of this concept implies that human lungs contain approximately 300 million pNVUs. This concept of existing local regulation of microvascular blood flow is supported by the observation of pathophysiology in pulmonary embolism and in acute high-altitude illness. The autonomic control seen in these three disease states matches blood flow with oxygen supply in each pNVU to maintain physiological blood oxygen saturation level. Here, I illustrate how the malfunction of microvascular pericytes may cause focal hemorrhage, edema or microvascular congestion and thrombosis. A bypass existing in each pNVU would autonomically deviate blood flow from a COVID-19-affected pNVU to other healthy pNVUs. This action would prevent systemically applied medicines from reaching the therapeutic threshold in COVID-19- affected pNVUs. While testing this hypothesis with experimental evidence is urgently needed, supporting therapy aimed at improving microcirculation or rebuilding the physiological function of microvascular pericytes is recommended as a potentially effective treatment of COVID 19.","He, Zhen",Current neurovascular research,https://doi.org/10.2174/1567202617666201222112639; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355054/,223

Having demonstrated in a previous study that hypnosis facilitates the exploration of such events, we now aim to explore and classify the content of these events and to determine whether there is an association between the type of event, the state of consciousness in which the patient verbalized it, and possible causal attributions of the disorder. METHOD Thirty-two women (age 52 ± 7 years) suffering from fibromyalgia and receiving care in a primary healthcare center participated in the same semi-structured interview twice: once in a wakeful state and once under hypnosis. They answered two questions: what other events in your life coincided with the onset of fibromyalgia? Are those events related to your fibromyalgia in any way? To counteract biases related to order or recall, the order of the two interviews was randomized with a 3-month period in between. RESULTS The patients verbalized 23 different types of events, which we classified into eight categories, mostly psychosocial events. Although the relationship between the three variables was not statistically significant, two of the bivariate associations predicted (type of event and state of consciousness; and state of consciousness and causal attribution) were confirmed (χ2 , P values of .01 and <.001 respectively).

94879,Pandemics show us what government is for.,2020-04-03,"UNLABELLED The sudden emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and, more recently, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) underscores the importance of understanding critical aspects of CoV infection and pathogenesis. Despite significant insights into CoV cross-species transmission, replication, and virus-host interactions, successful therapeutic options for CoVs do not yet exist. Recent identification of SARS-CoV NSP16 as a viral 2'-O-methyltransferase (2'-O-MTase) led to the possibility of utilizing this pathway to both attenuate SARS-CoV infection and develop novel therapeutic treatment options. Mutations were introduced into SARS-CoV NSP16 within the conserved KDKE motif and effectively attenuated the resulting SARS-CoV mutant viruses both in vitro and in vivo. While viruses lacking 2'-O-MTase activity had enhanced sensitivity to type I interferon (IFN), they were not completely restored in their absence in vivo. However, the absence of either MDA5 or IFIT1, IFN-responsive genes that recognize unmethylated 2'-O RNA, resulted in restored replication and virulence of the dNSP16 mutant virus. Finally, using the mutant as a live-attenuated vaccine showed significant promise for possible therapeutic development against SARS-CoV. Together, the data underscore the necessity of 2'-O-MTase activity for SARS-CoV pathogenesis and identify host immune pathways that mediate this attenuation. In addition, we describe novel treatment avenues that exploit this pathway and could potentially be used against a diverse range of viral pathogens that utilize 2'-O-MTase activity to subvert the immune system. IMPORTANCE Preventing recognition by the host immune response represents a critical aspect necessary for successful viral infection. Several viruses, including SARS-CoV, utilize virally encoded 2'-O-MTases to camouflage and obscure their viral RNA from host cell sensing machinery, thus preventing recognition and activation of cell intrinsic defense pathways. For SARS-CoV, the absence of this 2'-O-MTase activity results in significant attenuation characterized by decreased viral replication, reduced weight loss, and limited breathing dysfunction in mice. The results indicate that both MDA5, a recognition molecule, and the IFIT family play an important role in mediating this attenuation with restored virulence observed in their absence. Understanding this virus-host interaction provided an opportunity to design a successful live-attenuated vaccine for SARS-CoV and opens avenues for treatment and prevention of emerging CoVs and other RNA virus infections.","Menachery, Vineet D; Yount, Boyd L; Josset, Laurence; Gralinski, Lisa E; Scobey, Trevor; Agnihothram, Sudhakar; Katze, Michael G; Baric, Ralph S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03571-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24478444/,223

Pharmaceuticals and research labs across the world are racing to find vaccines and treatments for the new coronavirus, using a variety of different technological ways. With Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is observed that asymptomatic symptoms turn out to be severe and fatal. By raising pyrexia, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ failure are observed to develop which are not only associated with coronavirus. The treatment of the virus and the systemic inflammatory response it causes are also very important. The rapid response to infection has been well defined and comprises a complex interaction of cytokine storm, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and pathologic coagulation. Since the effective therapies are missing and immunological treatments may be deficient, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), by reason of their potent immunomodulatory ability, can have useful results in order to prevent the cytokine storm and reduce morbidity and mortality for COVID-19. The aim of this article is to discuss the potential effect of MSCs types in COVID-19 infection without definite treatment.","Yıldız Gülhan, Pınar",Tuberkuloz ve toraks,https://doi.org/10.5578/tt.69770; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33448740/,223

Methods: A total of 20 patients were reviewed who underwent the resection of benign tumor in the superficial lobe of parotid gland with retroauricular sulcus incision at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, the Linyi City People Hospital between May 2015 and March 2017. There were 12 males and 8 females with an age range of 12-66 years old, including 15 cases with mixed tumor and 5 cases with adenolymphoma. Surgical procedure included facial never dissection from the main trunk to facial never cervical trunk, temporal trunk and peripheral branches. After resection of tumor and superficial lobe of parotid gland, and sternocleidomastoid muscle flap was used to fill the defect in parotid area. All patients were postoperatively followed up after surgery. Results: Surgeries were successfully operated in all patients. Follow-up for 2 years showed there was no presence of recurrence, salivary fistula, Frey syndrome, scar affecting facial appearance, or significant deformity in the surgical area. Conclusion: Surgery for superficial lobe of parotid gland and facial nerve dissection through retroauricular sulcus incision have some advantages such as incision concealment, simple procedure for facial nerve dissection, simultaneous repair of tissue defects with sternocleidomastoid muscle flap, and less complications.","Wang, Y H; Zhang, T G; Chen, Z P; Lyu, H Q",Zhonghua er bi yan hou tou jing wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of otorhinolaryngology head and neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn115330-20200221-00109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911889/,223

The impacts are multiple especially for patients cared for cancer. The Covid-19 epidemic has several impacts on the management of lung cancer patients. The aim of this work was to summarize the available epidemiological data on patients diagnosed with lung cancer infected with Covid-19 and describe the different strategies to improve the management of these patients by summarizing the recommendations in this area. PATIENTS AND METHODS The Teravolt cohort is an observational multicenter registry, including patients with non-small cell cancer, small cell cancer or mesothelioma but also epithelial tumors and a diagnosis of Covid-19. The Theravolt registry indicates an unexpectedly high mortality rate in patients with thoracic malignancies with COVID-19. RESULTS Between March 26 and April 12, 2020, 200 patients treated in 8 countries were included. They had a performance status (PS) of 0-1 in 72% of cases, were smokers or ex-smokers in 81% of cases, had non-small cell cancer (76% of cases), were under treatment in 74% of cases, and the majority were first-line cases (57%). The hospitalization rate was 76% and the mortality rate 33%; only 10% of patients with criteria for intensive care hospitalization were admitted to the intensive care. CONCLUSION Data presented in this registry suggest a high mortality in patients with thoracic cancer and Covid-19. Therofere, the importance to create a safe healthcare system during Covid-19 pandemic is underlined along with the need for essential effective clinical service delivery to patients with lung cancer.","Haineala, Bogdan; Zgura, Anca; Badiu, Dumitru Cristinel; Iliescu, Laura; Anghel, Rodica Maricela; Bacinschi, Xenia Elena",In vivo,https://doi.org/10.21873/invivo.12450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33910875/,223

Outcomes of patients treated with the radiofrequency ablation ClosureFast™ system over an eight-year period from a single-center were evaluated. Methods Three-year follow-up data included duplex ultrasound scan, complication rate, and questionnaires to assess patients' QOL, level of pain, and days off work. Results A total of 1080 consecutive patients (49.5 ± 18.6 years, 72% female, mean body mass index: 25.44 ± 4.1 kg m-2) underwent radiofrequency ablation for incompetent saphenous veins in a single institution. Occlusion of the great saphenous vein was obtained in 98.6% and 93.8% cases at the end of the procedures and within 36 months, respectively. Only three deep venous thromboses and minor complications occurred in this series throughout the first week from the procedure. A decrease of the external vein diameter, equal to 72.7% and 31.1% of the pretreatment diameter, was observed at 1 week and 36 months, respectively. The average Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire score improved from 18.06 ± 9.47 before treatment to 11.56 ± 10.23 at 12 months, with no significant differences in the subsequent follow-up. SF-36 QOL scores significantly improved after the procedure in all domains, while there were no changes over time. Patients reported a prompt return to normal daily activities (1.5 ± 0.7 days) and work (3.1 ± 1.9 days). Body mass index influenced QOL scores, while it did not affect great saphenous vein diameter reduction during the follow-up. On the contrary, Clinical Etiologic Anatomic Pathophysiologic class significantly influenced both great saphenous vein diameter reduction after the treatment and QOL scores within 36 months. Conclusion Results of this retrospective monocentric, large patients study suggest that radiofrequency ablation of the great saphenous vein may be a safe and efficient alternative to conventional surgery.","Casana, Renato; Tolva, Valerio Stefano; Odero, Andrea; Malloggi, Chiara; Parati, Gianfranco",Vascular,https://doi.org/10.1177/1708538118762066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29486654/,223

99012,July-August 2020 Issue.,2020,"INTRODUCTION Local treatment of metastases is frequently performed in patients with multiorgan metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) analogous to selected patients with oligometastatic disease for whom this is standard of care. The ORCHESTRA trial (NCT01792934) was designed to prospectively evaluate overall survival benefit from tumor debulking in addition to chemotherapy in patients with multiorgan mCRC. Here, we report the preplanned safety and feasibility evaluation after inclusion of the first 100 patients. METHODS Patients were eligible if at least 80% tumor debulking was deemed feasible by resection, radiotherapy and/or thermal ablative therapy. In case of clinical benefit after three or four cycles of respectively 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin or capecitabine and oxaliplatin ± bevacizumab patients were randomized to tumor debulking followed by chemotherapy in the intervention arm, or standard treatment with chemotherapy. RESULTS Twelve patients dropped out prior to randomization for various reasons. Eighty-eight patients were randomized to the standard (n = 43) or intervention arm (n = 45). No patients withdrew after randomization. Debulking was performed in 82% (n = 37). Two patients had no lesions left to treat, five had progressive disease, and one patient died prior to local treatment. In 15 patients (40%) 21 serious adverse events related to debulking were reported. Postoperative mortality was 2.7% (n = 1). After debulking chemotherapy was resumed in 89% of patients. CONCLUSION Tumor debulking is feasible and does not prohibit administration of palliative chemotherapy in the majority of patients with multiorgan mCRC, despite the occurrence of serious adverse events related to local treatment. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE This first prospective randomized trial on tumor debulking in addition to chemotherapy shows that local treatment of metastases is feasible in patients with multiorgan metastatic colorectal cancer and does not prohibit administration of palliative systemic therapy, despite the occurrence of serious adverse events related to local treatment. The trial continues accrual and overall survival (OS) data and quality of life assessment are collected to determine whether the primary aim of >6 months OS benefit with preserved quality of life will be met. This will support evidence-based decision making in multidisciplinary colorectal cancer care and can be readily implemented in daily practice.","Gootjes, Elske C; van der Stok, Eric P; Buffart, Tineke E; Bakkerus, Lotte; Labots, Mariette; Zonderhuis, Barbara M; Tuynman, Jurriaan B; Meijerink, Martijn R; van de Ven, Peter M; Haasbeek, Cornelis J A; Ten Tije, Albert J; de Groot, Jan-Willem B; Hendriks, Mathijs P; van Meerten, Esther; Nuyttens, Joost J M E; Grunhagen, Dirk J; Verhoef, Cornelis; Verheul, Henk M W",The oncologist,https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32490570/,223

The aim of this study was to assess the value of ColoShield in reducing peritoneal contamination during a transrectal procedure. METHODS Sixteen pigs underwent transrectal hybrid NOTES cholecystectomy after standardized disinfective rectal washout either with endolumenal colon occlusion using ColoShield (N = 8) or without colon occlusion (N = 8). Rectal swab samples were taken before and after rectal washout and at the end of the procedure. Peritoneal biopsies for microbiological evaluation were obtained at the end of the procedure and at necropsy 7 days after surgery. RESULTS Peritoneal contamination at the end of surgery was significantly lower using ColoShield compared to not using colon occlusion [13 (1/8) vs. 75 % (6/8); P = 0.012]. No significant differences were found regarding contamination of rectal swabs and peritoneal contamination at necropsy. CONCLUSION The application of ColoShield may increase the safety of transrectal NOTES and transanal endoscopic procedures by reducing peritoneal contamination and consecutive infectious complications.","Senft, Jonas D; Carstensen, Benedict; Mischnik, Alexander; Warschkow, Rene; Müller-Stich, Beat P; Linke, Georg R",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4582-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26487201/,223

AIMS To characterise a motor-free cognitive profile of adolescents with CP using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fifth edition (WISC-V) and explore the influence of clinical factors on cognitive abilities. METHODS AND PROCEDURE The WISC-V was used to assess cognitive abilities in 70 adolescents (M = 14 years 6 months, SD = 10 months). Sixty-six adolescents (Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) Level I, n = 26 ; II, n = 23; III, n = 15; IV, n = 1; V, n = 1) obtained either a Motor-free IQ or index score using the motor-free method. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS MFIQ and index scores fell below the normative data and rates of borderline and impaired cognitive abilities were significantly higher in the CP group. Scores showed an uneven cognitive profile with a relative strength in verbal abilities. Severity of motor impairment and small for gestational age (SGA) were associated with lower IQ scores. A history of seizures was related to lower verbal abilities. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Cognitive abilities of adolescents with CP are significantly below expectation compared to normative data. Severity of motor impairment, SGA, and seizures need to be recognised by health professionals as risk factors for cognitive impairment. A substantial proportion of adolescents showed borderline cognitive abilities, constituting a group with CP which are relatively neglected in the literature.","Coceski, Monika; Hocking, Darren R; Abu-Rayya, Hisham M; Sherwell, Sarah; Reid, Susan M; Reddihough, Dinah S; Wrennall, Jacquie; Stargatt, Robyn",Research in developmental disabilities,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2021.103934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740670/,223

Objective: we aimed to assess STD in healthcare professionals (HCP), mainly allergists, affected with COVID-19, by means of a survey, and to evaluate the association of STD and their severity with demographic characteristics, symptoms, comorbidities, and hospital admission. METHODS A 15-item questionnaire was designed including different sections as follows: demographics, diagnostic characteristics, STD patterns, medication use as well as comorbidities. The questionnaire was developed using Google forms, implemented and distributed to members of the Spanish Society of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (SEAIC) and spread via Social Media to be completed by HCP affected with COVID-19. RESULTS HCP (n=234), 76.5% ≤55 yrs, 73.5% female, completed the survey. There was STD in up to 74.4% of the respondents, 95.6% reporting a moderate-severe impairment. Mean recovery time of taste dysfunction was 21.6±24.0 days in HCP ≤55 yrs and 33.61±26.2 days in >55 yrs (p=0.019). Stratified analysis by severity of STD showed that more than a half of COVID-19 subjects presented severe loss of smell. An older age (>55 yrs) was associated with fever, anorexia, less headache and with a longer persistence of taste dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS STD is a common symptom in COVID-19, even as a unique or preceding symptom. HCP who declared smell dysfunction (SD) were younger than those not affected with STD. Taste dysfunction (TD) may imply more systemic involvement in COVID-19-positive HCP.","Amérigo, D A; Cubero, J L; Colás, C; Alobid, I; Mullol, J; Valero, A",Journal of investigational allergology & clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.18176/jiaci.0670; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33465033/,223

Data collection includes qualitative method, such as interviews with agro-food chain stakeholders, that is producers, processors, consumers, and quantitative consumer survey. Data collection was carried out in Argentina and in Italy. Results show that in Argentina yerba mate consumption is driven by habit and tradition, and in Italy yerba mate is mostly unknown. Consumers tend to drink yerba mate in Argentina and other caffeine-containing beverages in Italy to socialize, and as source of energy. Consumers have little awareness of yerba mate antioxidant properties. Yerba mate provides the energy of coffee drinking, and the taste and pleasure of tea drinking. Italian consumers' key challenge to yerba mate drinking is the longer time it takes, compared to the usual espresso.

Although many computational methods to predict protein inhibitors have been developed [ 1- 5], few systematic reviews on these methods have been published. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the existing methods to discover potential inhibitors of COVID-19 virus, so-called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). First, we briefly categorize and describe computational approaches by the basic algorithms involved in. Then we review the related biological datasets used in such predictions. Furthermore, we emphatically discuss current knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors with the latest findings and development of computational methods in uncovering protein inhibitors against COVID-19.","Liu, Qiaoming; Wan, Jun; Wang, Guohua",Briefings in bioinformatics,https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbab416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34623382/,223
102477,Special issue on memory maintenance.,2021-09-01,"Epilepsy is a highly prevalent neurological disease and anti-epileptic drugs (AED) are almost the unique clinical treatment option. A disbalanced brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been proposed in epilepsy and several reports have shown that angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor-1 (ATR1) activation is pro-inflammatory and pro-epileptogenic. In agreement, ATR1 blockage with the repurposed drug losartan has shown benefits in animal models of epilepsy. Processing of Ang II by ACE2 enzyme renders Ang-(1-7), a metabolite that activates the mitochondrial assembly (Mas) receptor (MasR) pathway. MasR activation presents beneficial effects, facilitating vasodilatation, increasing anti-inflammatory and antioxidative responses. In a recent paper published in Clinical Science, Gomes and colleagues (Clin. Sci. (Lond.) (2020) 134, 2263-2277) performed intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of Ang-(1-7) in animals subjected to the pilocarpine model of epilepsy, starting after the first spontaneous motor seizure (SMS). They showed that this approach reduced the frequency of SMS, restored animal anxiety, increased exploration, and augmented the hippocampal expression of protective catalase enzyme and antiapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). Interestingly, but surprisingly, Gomes and colleagues showed that MasR expression and mTor activity were reduced in the hippocampus of the epileptic Ang-(1-7) treated animals. These results show that Ang-(1-7) administration could represent a new avenue for developing strategies for the management of epilepsy in clinical settings. However, future work is necessary to evaluate the levels of RAS metabolites and the activity of key enzymes in these experimental interventions to completely understand the therapeutic potential of the brain RAS manipulation in epilepsy.","Ramos, Alberto Javier",Clinical science,https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20201296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729497/,223

Our objective was to evaluate the gender-specific differences in patient characteristics and clinical outcomes among patients with CLI. We performed a retrospective analysis of 97 women and 122 men presenting with CLI who underwent angiography from 2006 to 2010. Baseline demographics, procedural details, and lesion characteristics were assessed for each patient. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess long-term patient and lesion-level outcomes. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to evaluate the relationship between gender and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Compared to men, women were less likely to have a history of coronary artery disease (39% vs 54%, p = 0.02) or diabetes (57% vs 70%, p = 0.05) but had similar baseline medical therapy. At angiography, women were more likely to have significant femoropopliteal (77% vs 67%, p = 0.02) and multi-level infrainguinal disease (63% vs 51%, p = 0.02). Women were also more likely to undergo multi-vessel percutaneous intervention (69% vs 55%, p = 0.05), but had similar rates of limb salvage after percutaneous intervention or surgical bypass (HR 0.94 [95% CI 0.45-1.94], p = 0.9). During follow-up, women had higher rates of subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events (HR 1.63 [95% CI 1.01-2.63], p = 0.04). In conclusion, women with CLI are more likely to present with femoropopliteal and multi-level infrainguinal disease. Despite similar rates of limb salvage, women with CLI have an increased rate of subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events.","McCoach, Caroline E; Armstrong, Ehrin J; Singh, Satinder; Javed, Usman; Anderson, David; Yeo, Khung Keong; Westin, Gregory G; Hedayati, Nasim; Amsterdam, Ezra A; Laird, John R",Vascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/1358863x13475836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23439776/,223

However, the effectiveness of endotracheal tube with subglottic secretion drainage (ETT-SD) and cuff pressure monitorization in VAP bundles have not been adequately assessed. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of VAP bundle containing ETT-SD and cuff pressure monitorization. This was a prospective, controlled study that was carried out between March 2011 and April 2012 including intubated patients. The study was conducted at the Anesthesiology Intensive Care Unit 1 and 2 (10 beds each) in a 898-bed university hospital. Occurrence of VAP and compliance with the parameters of the VAP prevention bundles were assessed daily. Patients intubated with the standard endotracheal tube were recruited as controls, mainly in the first six months of the study as ETT-SD and cuff pressure monometer had not yet been implemented. In the second term, patients intubated with ETT-SD were included as cases. Occurrence of VAP, mortality, and compliance with VAP prevention bundles were monitored.

104683,In-situ Electrospinning for Intestinal Hemostasis.,2020,"OBJECT Flow-diversion treatment has been shown to be associated with high rates of angiographic obliteration; however, the treatment is relatively contraindicated in the acute phase following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) as these patients require periprocedural dual antiplatelet therapy. Acute coiling followed by flow diversion has emerged as an intriguing and feasible treatment option for ruptured complex and giant aneurysms. In this study the authors report outcomes and complications of patients with ruptured aneurysms undergoing coiling in the acute phase followed by planned delayed flow diversion. METHODS This case series includes patients from 2 institutions. All patients underwent standard endovascular coiling in the acute phase after SAH with the intention and plan to proceed with flow diversion at a later date. Outcomes studied included angiographic occlusion, procedure-related complications, and long-term clinical outcome as measured using the modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS A total of 31 patients underwent coiling in the acute phase with the intention to undergo flow diversion at a later date. The mean aneurysm size was 15.8 ± 7.9 mm. Of the 31 patients undergoing coiling, 4 patients could not undergo further flow-diverter therapy: 3 patients (9.7%) died of complications of subarachnoid hemorrhage and 1 patient had permanent morbidity as a result of perioperative ischemic stroke (3.1%). Twenty-seven patients underwent staged placement of flow diverters after adequate recovery. The median time to treatment was 16 weeks. There was one case of aneurysm rebleeding following coil treatment. There were no cases of permanent morbidity or mortality resulting from flow-diverter treatment. Twenty-four patients underwent imaging follow-up; 18 of these patients had aneurysms that were completely or nearly completely occluded (58.1% on an intent-to-treat basis). At last follow-up (mean 18.3 months), 25 patients had mRS scores ≤ 2 (80.6% on an intent-to-treat basis). CONCLUSIONS Staged treatment of ruptured complex and giant intracranial aneurysms with coiling in the acute phase and flow-diverter treatment following recovery from SAH is both safe and effective. In this series, no cases of rebleeding occurred during the interval between coiling and flow diversion.

In this study of recipients of allogeneic (Allo) and autologous (Auto) hematopoietic cell transplant and CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, we aimed to identify clinical variables associated with COVID-19 severity and assess lymphocyte populations. METHODS We retrospectively investigated patients diagnosed between March 15th and May 7th, 2020. In a subset of patients, lymphocyte immunophenotyping, quantitative real-time PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs, and SARS-CoV-2 antibody status were available. RESULTS We identified 77 SARS-CoV-2 + cellular therapy recipients (Allo = 35, Auto = 37, CAR-T = 5; median time from cellular therapy 782 days (IQR 354,1611). Overall survival at 30 days was 78%. Clinical variables significantly associated with the composite endpoint of non-rebreather or higher oxygen requirement and death (n events = 25/77) included number of co-morbidities (HR 5.41, P = 0.004), infiltrates (HR 3.08, P = 0.032), and neutropenia (HR 1.15, P = 0.04). Worsening graft-versus-host-disease was not identified among Allo subjects. Immune profiling revealed reductions and rapid recovery in lymphocyte populations across lymphocyte subsets. Antibody responses were seen in a subset of patients. CONCLUSION In this series of Allo, Auto, and CAR-T recipients, we report overall favorable clinical outcomes for COVID-19 patients without active malignancy and provide preliminary insights into the lymphocyte populations that are key for the anti-viral response and immune reconstitution.

Primary outcome was change from baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog). RESULTS Five placebo-controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to placebo, IVIg 0.2 and 0.4 g/kg once every two weeks did not change ADAS-Cog score (weighted mean difference: 0.37, 95% confidence interval: -1.46 to 2.20 and 0.77, -1.34 to 2.88, respectively). Furthermore, except for an increase in the incidence of rash, IVIg did not affect the incidence of other adverse events.

108152,Retransplantation should be offered to children with liver graft failure.,2020-10-22,"The increasing need for rapid, in situ, and robust tissue profiling approaches in the context of intraoperative diagnostics has led to the development of a large number of ambient ionization-based surface sampling strategies. This paper compares the performances of a diathermic knife and a CO2 laser handpiece, both clinically approved, coupled to a rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS) source for quasi-instantaneous tissue classification. Several fresh meat samples (muscle, liver, bone, bone marrow, cartilage, skin, fat) were obtained from different animals. Overall, the laser produced cleaner cuts and more reproducible and higher spectral quality signals when compared with the diathermic knife (CV laser = 9-12%, CV diathermic = 14-23%). The molecular profiles were subsequently entered into a database and PCA/LDA classification/prediction models were built to assess if the data generated with one sampling modality can be employed to classify the data generated with the other handpiece. We demonstrate that the correct classification rate of the models increases (+ 25%) with the introduction of a model based on peak lists that are tissue-specific and common to the two handpieces, compared with considering solely the whole molecular profile. This renders it possible to use a unique and universal database for quasi-instantaneous tissue recognition which would provide similar classification results independent of the handpiece used. Furthermore, the laser was able to generate aerosols rich in lipids from hard tissues such as bone, bone marrow, and cartilage. Combined, these results demonstrate that REIMS is a valuable and versatile tool for instantaneous identification/classification of hard tissue and coupling to different aerosol-generating handpieces expands its field of application.

110904,Reducing Intraoperative Hypotension Using a Machine Learning-Derived Early Warning System-Reply.,2020-08-25,"INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the single greatest contributor to global mortality. The successful introduction and scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivered a reduction in HIV mortality. Consequently, an association was found between the scale-up of ART and an increased prevalence of comorbidities among people living with HIV (PLWH) such as hypertension and dyslipidaemia. A higher quality diet can delay the onset of comorbidities related to HIV infection. Diet quality and its methods of assessment are not fully established among PLWH. This review will identify the diet quality and food insecurity indices that have been used among PLWH and how these constructs are associated with risk of developing CVD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The frameworks recommended by Arksey and O'Malley and the Joanna Briggs Institute's manual for conducting scoping reviews will be adopted. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines will be used for reporting. A search strategy was developed using keywords related to the topic. A preliminary MEDLINE (via PubMed) search was conducted on 11 November 2020 to develop a comprehensive search strategy. The final search will be conducted on PubMed, EbscoHost, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases. Titles and abstracts of retrieved records will be screened independently by two reviewers. Data will be extracted from records that meet the inclusion criteria using a predesigned charting tool. Discrepancies in decisions made by reviewers will be resolved by consensus or the decision of a third reviewer. Extracted data will be presented in tables or charts. A descriptive summary of the charts or tables will follow. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required for a scoping review. Findings will inform other studies currently underway and will be presented at conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.

METHOD Four databases were explored, without any year or language restrictions. The baseline search paradigm was limited to open-labelled clinical and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RESULTS Four major classes of anti-inflammatory drugs were identified, namely polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, anti-TNFalpha and minocycline. Effectiveness and benefit/risk ratio of each class in MDD, bipolar disorders and schizophrenia was detailed when data were available. Several meta-analyses indicated effectiveness of PUFAs in MDD with a good tolerance profile. One meta-analysis indicated that COX-2 specific inhibitors showed effectiveness in schizophrenia. Anti-TNFalpha showed important effectiveness in resistant MDD with blood inflammatory abnormalities. Minocycline showed effectiveness in schizophrenia. CONCLUSION Polyunsaturated fatty acids seem to have the best benefit/risk ratio profile but proved their effectiveness only in MDD. A number of anti-inflammatory drugs are available as adjunct treatment for treatment-resistant patients with MDD, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. If used with caution regarding their possible side-effects, they may be reasonable therapeutic alternatives for resistant symptomatology.","Fond, G; Hamdani, N; Kapczinski, F; Boukouaci, W; Drancourt, N; Dargel, A; Oliveira, J; Le Guen, E; Marlinge, E; Tamouza, R; Leboyer, M",Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/acps.12211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24215721/,223

112290,The photo-oxidative destruction of C.I. Basic Yellow 2 using UV/S(2)O(8)(2-) process in an annular photoreactor.,2008,"INTRODUCTION Minimally invasive surgery continues to revolutionize surgical standards with trends toward further minimalization and improved cosmesis. Approaches such as laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) and natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) have thus emerged. The authors devised an alternative method for a more efficient approach to minimally invasive surgery called no visible scar (NVIS). This study describes NVIS and its ability to provide operative capacity and outcomes similar to other minimal access techniques, but with improved cosmesis and possibly decreased associated complications. METHODS This is a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing colectomy between June 2009 and March 2010 to evaluate our outcomes with the NVIS technique (surgical approach via a 4-5 cm suprapubic site for inserting trocars/multiport and specimen extraction, with a 5-mm umbilical incision for a single trocar). Outcome measures included intraoperative complications, postoperative morbidity, and cosmetic outcome. RESULTS Ten patients with a mean age of 60.3 years underwent NVIS colectomy. The average operating time was 161.3 minutes with a mean blood loss of 56.5 mL. There were no conversions to open surgery. One patient required additional trocar placement. No perioperative complications were encountered. On follow-up, no wound complications were noted and all patients appeared satisfied with their cosmetic outcome. One patient was readmitted for a low-grade fever, but the NVIS technique was not identified as a contributor. CONCLUSION NVIS is a safe and feasible minimal access alternative, which improves cosmesis and may decrease complications associated with other minimally invasive techniques. Further analysis in a larger patient population is warranted to support our findings.","Tung, Vicrumdeep S; Buchberg, Brian; Masoomi, Hossein; Reavis, Kevin; Nguyen, Ninh T; Mills, Steven; Stamos, Michael J",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350610387801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21189268/,223

Methods This is a cross-sectional study that was conducted from January 2018 to May 2019 in Rasht (North of Iran). The participants included 215 menopausal women and their spouses. Data were collected using the demographic questionnaire, the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire, and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire. Results On the basis of the FSFI and IIEF scores, 36.28% (78/215) women reported female sexual dysfunction (FSD) and 17.2% (37/215) men reported erectile dysfunction (ED) with 8.37% (N = 18) being mild, 5.58% (N = 12) mild to moderate, and 3.25% (N = 7) moderate ED. After adjusting differences in the female age distribution, the total score and scores of the IIEF subscales were also not significantly lower in the spouses of women with FSD than women without FSD. Conclusion Although, significant correlations between male erectile function and menopausal female sexual function have not identified; but, low scores of the subscales of FSFI in female participants mostly impaired sexual satisfaction and overall satisfaction in their spouses.","Khalesi, Zahra Bostani; Jafarzadeh-Kenarsari, Fatemeh; Mobarrez, Yalda Donyaei; Abedinzade, Mahmood",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v20i4.56; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394264/,223

The KD was demonstrated to reduce cerebral oedema, apoptosis, improve cerebral metabolism and behavioural outcomes in rodent TBIs. Additionally, the KD affected rodent TBIs in an age-dependent manner. Due to a lack of relevant outcome measures, the human trials did not establish much evidence with respect to the KD as a treatment for TBI; only its safety was established.

113968,Spatiotemporal variability of solid waste on sandy beaches with different access restrictions.,2021-08-02,"BACKGROUND Primary dysmenorrhea is cramping abdominal pain associated with menses. It is prevalent, affects quality of life, and can cause absenteeism. Although evidence-based medical treatment options exist, women may not tolerate these or may prefer to use nonmedical treatments. Physical activity has been recommended by clinicians for primary dysmenorrhea since the 1930s, but there is still no high-quality evidence on which to recommend its use. OBJECTIVE We sought to determine the effectiveness of physical activity for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea. STUDY DESIGN Systematic literature searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, PEDro, Allied and Complimentary Medicine Database, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Clinicaltrials.gov, and OpenGrey were performed, from database inception to May 24, 2017. Google searches and citation searching of previous reviews were also conducted. Studies were selected using the following PICOS criteria: participants were nonathlete females experiencing primary dysmenorrhea; intervention was physical activity delivered for at least 2 menstrual cycles; comparator was any comparator; outcomes were pain intensity or pain duration; and study type was randomized controlled trials. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Random effects meta-analyses for pain intensity and pain duration were conducted, with prespecified subgroup analysis by type of physical activity intervention. Strength of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. RESULTS Searches identified 15 eligible randomized controlled trials totaling 1681 participants. Data from 11 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Pooled results demonstrated effect estimates for physical activity vs comparators for pain intensity (-1.89 cm on visual analog scale; 95% CI, -2.96 to -1.09) and pain duration (-3.92 hours; 95% CI, -4.86 to -2.97). Heterogeneity for both of these results was high and only partly mitigated by subgroup analysis. Primary studies were of low or moderate methodological quality but results for pain intensity remained stable during sensitivity analysis by study quality. GRADE assessment found moderate-quality evidence for pain intensity and low-quality evidence for pain duration. CONCLUSION Clinicians can inform women that physical activity may be an effective treatment for primary dysmenorrhea but there is a need for high-quality trials before this can be confirmed.","Matthewman, Gemma; Lee, Alexandra; Kaur, Jaidev G; Daley, Amanda J",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2018.04.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29630882/,223
114025,Why proper understanding of confidence intervals and statistical significance is important.,2021-01-13,"Tissue electrolysis is an alternative modality that uses a low intensity direct electric current passing through at least 2 electrodes within the tissue and resulting electrochemical products including chlorine and hydrogen. These products induce changes in pH around electrodes and cause dehydration resulting from electroosmotic pressure, leading to changes in microenvironment and thus metabolism of the tissues, yielding apoptosis. The procedure requires adequate time for electrochemical reactions to yield products sufficient to induce apoptosis of the tissues. Incorporation of electroporation into electrolysis can decrease the treatment time and enhance the efficiency of electrolytic ablation. Electroporation causes permeabilization in the cell membrane allowing the efflux of potassium ions and extension of the electrochemical area, facilitating the electrolysis process. However, little is known about the combined effects on apoptosis in liver ablation. In this study, we performed an immunohistochemical evaluation of apoptosis for the incorporation of electroporation into electrolysis in liver tissues. To do so, the study was performed with microelectrodes for fixed treatment time while the applied voltage varied to increase the applied total energy for electrolysis. The apoptotic rate for electrolytic ablation increased with enhanced applied energy. The apoptotic rate was 4.31 ± 1.73 times that of control in the synergistic combination compared to 1.49 ± 0.33 times that of the control in electrolytic ablation alone. Additionally, tissue structure was better preserved in synergistic combination ablation compared to electrolysis with an increment of 3.8 mA. Thus, synergistic ablation may accelerate apoptosis and be a promising modality for the treatment of liver tumors.","Kim, Hong Bae; Chung, Jong Hoon",Technology in cancer research & treatment,https://doi.org/10.1177/1533033820948051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985353/,223
114957,Is science ever enough? Dare to play politics.,2020-12-10,"Cannabis extracts and products were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with Cold EI for their full content including terpenes, sesquiterpenes, sesquiterpinols, fatty acids, delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), other cannabinoids, hydrocarbons, sterols, diglycerides, triglycerides, and impurities. GC-MS with Cold EI is based on interfacing GC and MS with supersonic molecular beams (SMB) along with electron ionization of vibrationally cold sample compounds in the SMB in a fly-through ion source (hence the name Cold EI). GC-MS with Cold EI improves all the performance aspects of GC-MS, enables the analysis of Cannabinoids with OH groups without derivatization, while providing enhanced molecular ions for improved identification, and enables internal quantitation without calibration. We found over 50 cannabinoid compounds including a new one with a Cold EI mass spectrum very similar to delta 9-THC as well as relatively large cannabinoids with molecular weight above m/z = 400. Because the analysis was universal in full scan and not targeted, we found impurities such as bromo CBD and fluticasone propionate and could monitor the formation of oxidized CBD during decarboxylation. In addition, GC-MS with Cold EI enabled nontargeted full analysis of terpenes, sesquiterpenes, and sesquiterpinols in cannabis extracts with good internal quantitation. GC-MS with Cold EI further served with very good sensitivity for the concentration determination of delta 9-THC in CBD-related products. Finally, cannabis drugs such as EP-1 used in Israel for treatment of epilepsy and for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were analyzed for their full cannabinoids content for learning on the entourage effect and for drug activity optimization.","Amirav, Aviv; Neumark, Benny; Margolin Eren, Ksenia J; Fialkov, Alexander B; Tal, Noam",Journal of mass spectrometry : JMS,https://doi.org/10.1002/jms.4726; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955098/,223
115432,Anticipating Local Flaps Closed-Form Solution on 3D Face Models Using Finite Element Method.,2020-07-31,"Griffithsin (Grft) is a protein lectin derived from red algae that tightly binds the HIV envelope protein gp120 and effectively inhibits virus infection. This inhibition is due to the binding by Grft of high-mannose saccharides on the surface of gp120. Grft has been shown to be a tight dimer, but the role of the dimer in Grft's anti-HIV function has not been fully explored. To investigate the role of the Grft dimer in anti-HIV function, an obligate dimer of Grft was designed by expressing the protein with a peptide linker between the two subunits. This ""Grft-linker-Grft"" is a folded protein dimer, apparently nearly identical in structural properties to the wild-type protein. A ""one-armed"" obligate dimer was also designed (Grft-linker-Grft OneArm), with each of the three carbohydrate binding sites of one subunit mutated while the other subunit remained intact. While both constructed dimers retained the ability to bind gp120 and the viral surface, Grft-linker-Grft OneArm was 84- to 1,010-fold less able to inhibit HIV than wild-type Grft, while Grft-linker-Grft had near-wild-type antiviral potency. Furthermore, while the wild-type protein demonstrated the ability to alter the structure of gp120 by exposing the CD4 binding site, Grft-linker-Grft OneArm largely lost this ability. In experiments to investigate gp120 shedding, it was found that Grft has different effects on gp120 shedding for strains from subtype B and subtype C, and this might correlate with Grft function. Evidence is provided that the dimer form of Grft is critical to the function of this protein in HIV inhibition.","Xue, Jie; Hoorelbeke, Bart; Kagiampakis, Ioannis; Demeler, Borries; Balzarini, Jan; Liwang, Patricia J",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00332-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23752505/,223

MATERIALS AND METHODS We collected public opinion survey results about attitudes towards SARS-CoV-2 vaccination conducted in 2020 in 26 European countries. RESULTS The pooled surveys were conducted on a total of 24 970 participants; on average only 58% (n=14 365/24 970) of responders across Europe were willing to get a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine once it becomes available, 16% (n=3998/24 970) were neutral, and 26% (n=6607/24 970) were not planning to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2. Such a low vaccination response could make it exceedingly difficult to reach the herd immunity threshold for SARS-CoV-2 through vaccination. CONCLUSION It is very important to start conducting educational public health activities on the topic of vaccination as soon as possible, before a vaccine becomes available, in order to improve attitudes towards SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Only by educating the general public about the benefits, safety and efficacy of vaccines can we hope to avoid the unnecessary prolongation of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Marcec, Robert; Majta, Matea; Likic, Robert",Postgraduate medical journal,https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2020-138903; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33115909/,223

This may adversely affect the recovery process. AIMS This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between internalized stigmatization and subjective recovery in patients with schizophrenic. METHOD This research was performed for patients with schizophrenia at rehabilitation centers registered with the community mental health center. The survey was performed out with 94 patients in the recovery phase who met the inclusion criteria and who going to the center. Sociodemographic information form, internalized stigmatization scale and subjective recovery assessment scale were used in the collection of data. RESULTS In the study it was found that there is a relationship between internalized stigmatization and subjective recovery. Increased levels of internalized stigma patient outcome would decrease the level of recovery. CONCLUSION It is recommended that nurses perform intervention programs to reduce internalized stigmatization in patients with schizophrenia.","Kaşli, Seher; Al, Orhan; Bademli, Kerime",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020960762; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985298/,223

117375,Introduction to the Introduction.,2020-07-12,"BACKGROUND Different methods of pancreatic stump closure after distal pancreatectomy (DP) have been described to decrease the incidence of pancreatic fistula (PF) which still represents one of the most common complications in pancreatic surgery. We retrospectively compared the pancreato-jejunostomy technique with the hand-sewn closure of the pancreatic stump after DP, and analyzed clinical outcomes between the two groups, focusing on PF rate. METHODS Thirty-six patients undergoing open DP at our institution between May 2005 and December 2011 were included. They were divided in two groups depending on pancreatic remnant management: in 24 cases the stump was closed by hand-sewn suture (Group A), while in 12 earlier cases a pancreato-jejunostomy was performed (Group B). We analyzed postoperative data in terms of mortality, morbidity and length of hospital stay between the two groups. RESULTS PF occurred in 7 of 24 (29.1%) cases of group A (control group) compared to zero fistula rate in group B (anastomosis group) (p=0.005). Operative time was significantly higher in the anastomosis group (p=0.024). Mortality rate was 0% in both groups. Other postoperative outcomes such as hemorrhages, infections, medical complications and length of hospital stay were not significant between the two groups. CONCLUSION Despite a higher operative time, the pancreato-jejunostomy after DP seems to be related to a lower incidence of PF compared to the hand-sewn closure of the pancreatic remnant.","Meniconi, Roberto L; Caronna, Roberto; Borreca, Dario; Schiratti, Monica; Chirletti, Piero",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2482-13-23; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23819892/,223

118381,The Need for Research-Grade Systems Modeling Technologies for Life Science Education.,2020-12-15,"Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) is the archetypal polypeptide precursor of hormones and neuropeptides. In this review, we examine the variability in the individual peptides produced in different tissues and the impact of the simultaneous presence of their precursors or fragments. We also discuss the problems inherent in accurately measuring which of the precursors and their derived peptides are present in biological samples. We address how not being able to measure all the combinations of precursors and fragments quantitatively has affected our understanding of the pathophysiology associated with POMC processing. To understand how different ratios of peptides arise, we describe the role of the pro-hormone convertases (PCs) and their tissue specificities and consider the cellular processing pathways which enable regulated secretion of different peptides that play crucial roles in integrating a range of vital physiological functions. In the pituitary, correct processing of POMC peptides is essential to maintain the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and this processing can be disrupted in POMC-expressing tumors. In hypothalamic neurons expressing POMC, abnormalities in processing critically impact on the regulation of appetite, energy homeostasis, and body composition. More work is needed to understand whether expression of the POMC gene in a tissue equates to release of bioactive peptides. We suggest that this comprehensive view of POMC processing, with a focus on gaining a better understanding of the combination of peptides produced and their relative bioactivity, is a necessity for all involved in studying this fascinating physiological regulatory phenomenon.","Harno, Erika; Gali Ramamoorthy, Thanuja; Coll, Anthony P; White, Anne",Physiological reviews,https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00024.2017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30156493/,223
118406,The pandemic in pictures: how coronavirus is changing the world.,2020-04-07,"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) bacteria frequently cause severe enteric diseases primarily in children and in young rabbits. Their pathogenicity for pigs has been tested by oral infection of colostrum-deprived newborn, and of severely immunosuppressed weaned pigs, but colonisation of conventional weaned pigs by porcine EPEC has not been experimentally studied. EPEC show similarities to enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) additionally carrying shiga toxin genes integrated into the chromosome by lambdoid phages. We have demonstrated earlier that the porcine EPEC prototype strain P86-1390 (O45) could be transduced in vivo (in ligated loops of weaned pigs), by Stx2 phage derived from a human EHEC. Thus, the ability of this porcine EPEC strain to colonise conventional weaned pigs under farming conditions became a question of relevance to human health. To clarify this question, four intragastric infection experiments were performed on a total of 95 conventional weaned pigs. The EPEC P86-1390 and other well-characterised porcine EPEC strains were applied to 54 pigs, leaving 41 weaned pigs as negative controls. In three experiments moderate predispositions were applied: coinfections with enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) or with low-virulence TGE coronavirus, application of fumonisin B1 with a normal therapeutic dose of dexamethasone, and the increase of soybean protein concentration in the feed. A total of 41 weaned pigs served as negative controls inoculated with a commensal porcine E. coli. Housing conditions simulated the farm environment. As an overall result, ileal segments of 18.5% of infected pigs were shown to be colonised by EPEC, while no EPEC were detected in the ilea of controls. Among predisposing factors occurring on farms, feed protein content increased by 20% (26.3% crude protein, provided by 48% soybean meal) seemed to enhance EPEC colonisation and resulted in the mobilisation of spontaneous latent EPEC/ETEC infection. The results indicate that under normal farm conditions porcine EPEC may colonise conventional weaned pigs by inducing ileal attaching effacing (AE) lesions with reasonable frequency, without clinical signs. The results also suggest that conventional weaned pigs may represent undetected reservoirs of porcine EPEC, potentially giving rise to the emergence of new types of EHEC due to natural transduction by Stx phages.","Malik, Anna; Tóth, István; Nagy, Béla",Acta veterinaria Hungarica,https://doi.org/10.1556/avet.2012.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22903075/,223

119405,P2 porous titanium implants improve tendon healing in an acute rat supraspinatus repair model.,2017,"hen multiple mediators exist on the causal pathway from treatment to outcome, path analysis prevails for disentangling indirect effects along paths linking possibly several mediators. However, separately evaluating each indirect effect along different posited paths demands stringent assumptions, such as correctly specifying the mediators' causal structure, and no unobserved confounding among the mediators. These assumptions may be unfalsifiable in practice and, when they fail to hold, can result in misleading conclusions about the mediators. Nevertheless, these assumptions are avoidable when substantive interest is in inference about the indirect effects specific to each distinct mediator. In this article, we introduce a new definition of indirect effects called interventional indirect effects from the causal inference and epidemiology literature. Interventional indirect effects can be unbiasedly estimated without the assumptions above while retaining scientifically meaningful interpretations. We show that under a typical class of linear and additive mean models, estimators of interventional indirect effects adopt the same analytical form as prevalent product-of-coefficient estimators assuming a parallel mediator model. Prevalent estimators are therefore unbiased when estimating interventional indirect effects-even when there are unknown causal effects among the mediators-but require a different causal interpretation. When other mediators moderate the effect of each mediator on the outcome, and the mediators' covariance is affected by treatment, such an indirect effect due to the mediators' mutual dependence (on one another) cannot be attributed to any mediator alone. We exploit the proposed definitions of interventional indirect effects to develop novel estimators under such settings.

In order to examine the impact of such policies on schoolchildren, the aims of the present study were to (i) assess changes in the level of engagement in three internet-related activities (smartphone use, social media use, and gaming) before and during the COVID-19 outbreak, including prolonged and problematic engagement in these activities; (ii) investigate the differences of psychological distress before and after COVID-19 outbreak; and (iii) to use structural equation modeling to investigate the mediating roles of problematic internet-related behaviors in the causal relationships of psychological distress and time spent on internet-related activities. Methods Self-report measures were used to assess internet-related activities and psychological distress. Time spent on internet-related activities, problematic use of internet-related activities, and psychological distress were collected from primary school students (N = 535; 265 boys; M age = 10.32 years [SD = 0.84]). The data were first collected before the COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., early November 2019) and then collected again during the school suspension due to COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., end of March 2020) for comparisons of changes. Results Schoolchildren spent significantly more time on the smartphone (increased 1.02 h daily; P < 0.001) and social media (increased 0.73 h daily; P < 0.001) but not gaming (increased 0.14 h daily; P = 0.07) during the school suspension compared to the baseline. Schoolchildren who increased by 15 or 30 min daily on internet-related activities showed an increased level of psychological distress. The association between problematic use of social media and psychological distress was stronger during the school suspension (β = 0.584) than at the baseline (β = 0.451; P < 0.001). Conclusion Increased problematic use of internet-related activities among schoolchildren was associated with greater psychological distress. Parents should therefore monitor internet-related activities and psychological distress of their children to support their mental health.","Chen, I-Hua; Chen, Chao-Ying; Pakpour, Amir H; Griffiths, Mark D; Lin, Chung-Ying; Li, Xu-Dong; Tsang, Hector W H",Journal of behavioral addictions,https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2021.00006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33570506/,223

122584,"The Grass Is Always Greener, or Is It?",2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND Few comprehensive data exist on the etiology of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) among African children. METHODS From March 1, 2007 to February 28, 2010, we collected blood for culture and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction for 10 viruses and 3 atypical bacteria among children aged <5 years with SARI, defined as World Health Organization-classified severe or very severe pneumonia or oxygen saturation <90%, who visited a clinic in rural western Kenya. We collected swabs from controls without febrile or respiratory symptoms. We calculated odds ratios for infection among cases, adjusting for age and season in logistic regression. We calculated SARI incidence, adjusting for healthcare seeking for SARI in the community. RESULTS Two thousand nine hundred seventy-three SARI cases were identified (54% inpatient, 46% outpatient), yielding an adjusted incidence of 56 cases per 100 person-years. A pathogen was detected in 3.3% of noncontaminated blood cultures; non-typhi Salmonella (1.9%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.7%) predominated. A pathogen was detected in 84% of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal specimens, the most common being rhino/enterovirus (50%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 22%), adenovirus (16%) and influenza viruses (8%). Only RSV and influenza viruses were found more commonly among cases than controls (odds ratio 2.9, 95% confidence interval: 1.3-6.7 and odds ratio 4.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.1-21, respectively). Incidence of RSV, influenza viruses and S. pneumoniae were 7.1, 5.8 and 0.04 cases per 100 person-years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Among Kenyan children with SARI, RSV and influenza virus are the most likely viral causes and pneumococcus the most likely bacterial cause. Contemporaneous controls are important for interpreting upper respiratory tract specimens.","Feikin, Daniel R; Njenga, M Kariuki; Bigogo, Godfrey; Aura, Barrack; Aol, George; Audi, Allan; Jagero, Geoffrey; Muluare, Peter O; Gikunju, Stella; Nderitu, Leonard; Winchell, Jonas M; Schneider, Eileen; Erdman, Dean D; Oberste, M Steven; Katz, Mark A; Breiman, Robert F",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e31826fd39b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22914561/,223

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study included 814 RF ablation procedures of lung tumors. To evaluate the development of phrenic nerve injury, chest radiographs obtained before and after the procedure were examined. Phrenic nerve injury was assumed to have developed if the diaphragmatic level was elevated after the procedure. To identify risk factors for phrenic nerve injury, multiple variables were compared between cases of phrenic nerve injury and randomly selected controls by using univariate analyses. Multivariate analysis was then performed to identify independent risk factors. RESULTS Evaluation of phrenic nerve injury from chest radiographs was possible after 786 procedures. Evidence of phrenic nerve injury developed after 10 cases (1.3%). Univariate analysis revealed that larger tumor size (≥ 20 mm; P = .014), proximity of the phrenic nerve to the tumor (< 10 mm; P < .001), the use of larger electrodes (array diameter or noninsulated tip length ≥ 3 cm; P = .001), and higher maximum power applied during ablation (≥ 100 W; P < .001) were significantly associated with the development of phrenic nerve injury. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the proximity of the phrenic nerve to the tumor (< 10 mm; P < .001) was a significant independent risk factor. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of phrenic nerve injury after RF ablation was 1.3%. The proximity of the phrenic nerve to the tumor was an independent risk factor for phrenic nerve injury.","Matsui, Yusuke; Hiraki, Takao; Gobara, Hideo; Uka, Mayu; Masaoka, Yoshihisa; Tada, Akihiro; Toyooka, Shinichi; Mitsuhashi, Toshiharu; Mimura, Hidefumi; Kanazawa, Susumu",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2012.02.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22513393/,223

Intratumoral Tregs in DLBCL (n = 70) were evaluated by double-stained CD25 and FOXP3 lymphocytes in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, and correlated with clinicopathologic features. We found that increased numbers of intratumoral FOXP3+ lymphocytes (>2.4/HPF) and CD25 + FOXP3+ lymphocytes (>0.8/HPF) are favorable prognosticators (p = .004 and p < .001, respectively) in DLBCL patients, along with age <70 years, stage I-II disease, normal serum LDH level and low IPI scores (p < .001, .002, .002, and <.001, respectively). On multivariate analyses, a higher number of CD25 + FOXP3+ lymphocytes retained prognostic significance (p = .040). Interestingly, higher Treg infiltration correlated with increased infiltration by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (γ = 0.294, p = .038) and nodal location (γ = 0.390, p = .004), but not with infiltration by CD123+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which were reported to induce Tregs with immune tolerance.

DESIGN the trend of enrolment in the PROTECT study, ""A randomized study with Hydroxychloroquine versus observational support for prevention or early phase treatment of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)"" (Eudract number: 2020-001501-24, NCT04363827), conducted in the period from May to September 2020, was analysed to evaluate the possible association of the enrolment rate with the amount of information published in the national and local press on hydroxychloroquine. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS the PROTECT clinical study is an Italian interventional superiority study, open label, with cluster randomization, aimed at evaluating whether treatment with hydroxychloroquine can reduce the percentage of symptomatic subjects compared to observation only in a population of subjects exposed to SARS-CoV-2 virus consisting of cohabitants/contacts of COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic subjects diagnosed with COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES the number of asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic COVID-19 patients and the number of contacts/cohabitants of COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Protect study from May to September 2020. RESULTS from May to September 2020, the number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 enrolled in the PROTECT clinical trial showed a decrease consistent with the number of news on hydroxychloroquine appearing in the national and local press, starting from the time when the first criticisms of the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine were made known; the number of contacts/cohabitants of COVID-19 patients showed a more marked and more timely decrease. CONCLUSIONS in the context determined by the current COVID-19 pandemic, conducting a controlled clinical trial is strongly influenced by public opinion on scientific issues. Adherence to a clinical study can become highly problematic and invalidate the possibility of answering a scientific question and the validity of a project. In the current pandemic situation, randomized controlled trials may not always be the optimal tool to reach the expected scientific evidence, due to a number of problems. It is preferable to use a sequential or adaptive design. Furthermore, study protocols should implement innovative approaches that also include the involvement of participants in the decision-making process.

Control group was fed with a basal diet and the stress model group was fed with a 30 mg/Kg CORT-treated diet in ad libitum conditions for 7 days. Then, we used RNA-seq technology to identify the expression pattern of miRNAs, target genes, and relevant pathways in chicken spleen. Results showed that 71 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were determined, 9 of which were significantly differentially expressed miRNAs (SDEMs), and 241 target genes of DEMs were predicted. GO annotation and KEGG pathway analysis were carried out to understand the role of the DEMs. Out of 287 significantly enriched GO terms, 37 were stress- or immune-related, such as response to light stimulus, detection of oxidative stress, and immune response in mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue. Out of 85 KEGG pathways, 8 were related to stress or immunity, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and RLR signaling pathway. We then constructed the interaction networks between target genes from immune-related pathways and their DEMs. The analysis results suggested that some DEMs (gga-miR-17 family, gga-miR-15/16 family, gga-miR-2954 and gga-miR-34b-5p) and target genes (SIKE1, CX3CL1, IL11Ra, PIGR, and CDKN1A) were core miRNAs and genes.

BACKGROUND Previous studies have shown an increased risk of safety events in females compared to males undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. METHODS ORBIT II, a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, single arm study conducted in the US evaluated the safety and efficacy of the coronary OAS to facilitate stent placement in de novo, severely calcified coronary lesions in 443 subjects (286 males and 157 females). The rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization, and cardiac death was evaluated in-hospital and 30-days postprocedure. For this analysis, the ORBIT II safety and efficacy results were stratified by gender. RESULTS At baseline, females were significantly older than males and had a lower mean estimated glomerular filtration rate. Males had a higher rate of previous coronary artery bypass grafting and history of smoking. The rates of successful stent delivery and <50% residual stenosis were similar in males and females. In-hospital and 30-day MACE rates did not differ by gender. CONCLUSIONS Despite females being older, having smaller arteries, and more renal dysfunction, preparation of severely calcified coronary lesions with orbital atherectomy to facilitate stent deployment results in similar rates of in-hospital and 30-day MACE, irrespective of gender.","Kim, Christopher Y; Lee, Arthur C; Wiedenbeck, Troy L; Lee, Michael S; Chambers, Jeff W",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.26163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26331279/,223
124827,Inference for discretely observed stochastic kinetic networks with applications to epidemic modeling.,2012,"Civilian and military guidelines recommend balanced transfusion to patients with life-threatening bleeding. Early start of transfusion has shown improved survival. Thus, a balanced blood inventory must be available in all levels of health care to ensure early stabilization and damage control resuscitation of patients with bleeding. Whole blood has been reintroduced as a blood product for massive bleeding situations because it affords plasma, red blood cells, and platelets in a balanced ratio in a logistically advantageous way. In this article, we describe how to establish a whole blood-based blood preparedness program in a small rural hospital with limited resources. We present an implementation tool kit, which includes discussions on whole blood program strategies and the process of developing detailed procedures on donor selection, collection, storage, and transfusion management of whole blood. The importance of training and audit of the routines is highlighted, and establishment of an emergency walking blood bank is discussed. We conclude that implementation of a whole blood program is achievable in small rural hospitals and recommend that rural health care facilities at all treatment levels enable early balanced transfusion for patients with life-threatening bleeding by establishing protocols for whole blood-based preparedness.","Apelseth, Torunn O; Strandenes, Geir; Kristoffersen, Einar K; Hagen, Kristin G; Braathen, Hanne; Hervig, Tor",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32918285/,223
125139,An Updated Economic Analysis of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.,2021-02-01,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) is transmitted by blood-feeding insects (Culicoides sp.) and causes hemorrhagic diseases in livestock. BTV is a nonenveloped, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus with two capsids: a well-studied, stable core enclosing the dsRNA genome and a highly unstable, poorly studied coat responsible for host cell attachment and entry. Here, based on cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM), we report a 7-A resolution structure of the infectious BTV virion, including the coat proteins. We show that unlike other dsRNA viruses, the VP2 attachment trimer has a triskelion shape composed of three tip domains branching from a central hub domain. We identify three putative sialic acid-binding pockets in the hub and present supporting biochemical data indicating sugar moiety binding is important for BTV infection. Despite being a nonenveloped virus, the putative VP5 membrane penetration trimer, located slightly inward of the VP2 attachment trimer, has a central coiled-coil alpha-helical bundle, similar to the fusion proteins of many enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV, herpesviruses, vesicular stomatitis virus, and influenza virus). Moreover, mapping of the amino acid sequence of VP5 to the secondary structural elements identified by cryoEM locates 15 amphipathic alpha-helical regions on the external surface of each VP5 trimer. The cryoEM density map also reveals few, weak interactions between the VP5 trimer and both the outer-coat VP2 trimer and the underlying core VP7 trimer, suggesting that the surface of VP5 could unfurl like an umbrella during penetration and shedding of the coat to release the transcriptionally active core particle.","Zhang, Xing; Boyce, Mark; Bhattacharya, Bishnupriya; Zhang, Xiaokang; Schein, Stan; Roy, Polly; Zhou, Z Hong",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0913403107; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20332209/,223
125404,When your brain looks older than expected: combined lifestyle risk and BrainAGE.,2021-01-10,"BACKGROUND The global development and advancement of genomic medicine in the recent decade has accelerated the implementation of personalized medicine (PM) and pharmacogenomics (PGx) into clinical practice, while catalyzing the emergence of genetic testing (GT) with relevant ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI). RESULTS The perception of university undergraduates with regards to PM and PGx was investigated, and 80% of undergraduates valued PM as a promising healthcare model with 66% indicating awareness of personal genome testing companies. When asked about the curriculum design towards PM and PGx, compared to undergraduates in non-medically related curriculum, those studying in medically related curriculum had an adjusted 7.2 odds of perceiving that their curriculum was well-designed for learning PGx (95% CI 3.6-14.6) and a 3.7 odds of perceiving that PGx was important in their study (95% CI 2.0-6.8). Despite this, only 16% of medically related curriculum undergraduates would consider embarking on future education on PM. When asked about their perceptions on GT, 60% rated their genetic knowledge as ""School Biology"" level or below while 76% would consider undergoing a genetic test. As for ELSI, 75% of undergraduates perceived that they were aware of ethical issues of GT in general, particularly on ""Patient Privacy"" (80%) and ""Data Confidentiality"" (68%). Undergraduates were also asked about their perceived reaction upon receiving an unfavorable result from GT, and over half of the participants perceived that they would feel ""helpless or pessimistic"" (56%), ""inadequate or different"" (59%), and ""disadvantaged at job seeking"" (59%), while older undergraduates had an adjusted 2.0 odds of holding the latter opinion (95% CI 1.1-3.5), compared to younger undergraduates. CONCLUSION Hong Kong undergraduates showed a high awareness of PM but insufficient genetic knowledge and low interest in pursuing a career towards PM. They were generally aware of ethical issues of GT and especially concerned about patient privacy and data confidentiality. There was a predominance of pessimistic views towards unfavorable testing results. This study calls for the attention to evaluate education and talent development on genomics, and update existing legal frameworks on genetic testing in Hong Kong.","Cheung, Nicholas Yan Chai; Fung, Jasmine Lee Fong; Ng, Yvette Nga Chung; Wong, Wilfred Hing Sang; Chung, Claudia Ching Yan; Mak, Christopher Chun Yu; Chung, Brian Hon Yin",Human genomics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40246-021-00353-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407885/,223

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among HCWs responding to COVID-19 and its associated factors. METHODS A multi-country cross-sectional study was conducted during July-August 2020 among HCWs responding to COVID-19 in nine Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) countries. Data were collected using an online questionnaire administered using KoBo Toolbox. Mental problems were assessed using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). RESULTS A total of 1448 HCWs from nine EMR countries participated in this study. About 51.2% were male and 52.7% aged ≤ 30 years. Of all HCWs, 57.5% had depression, 42.0% had stress, and 59.1% had anxiety. Considering the severity, 19.2%, 16.1%, 26.6% of patients had severe to extremely severe depression, stress, and anxiety, respectively. Depression, stress, anxiety, and distress scores were significantly associated with participants' residency, having children, preexisting psychiatric illness, and being isolated for COVID-19. Furthermore, females, those working in a teaching hospital, and specialists had significantly higher depression and stress scores. Married status, current smoking, diabetes mellitus, having a friend who died with COVID-19, and high COVID-19 worry scores were significantly associated with higher distress scores. CONCLUSIONS Mental problems were prevalent among HCWs responding to COVID-19 in EMR. Therefore, special interventions to promote mental well-being among HCWs responding to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented.","Ghaleb, Yasser; Lami, Faris; Al Nsour, Mohannad; Rashak, Hiba Abdulrahman; Samy, Sahar; Khader, Yousef S; Al Serouri, Abdulwahed; BahaaEldin, Hala; Afifi, Salma; Elfadul, Maisa; Ikram, Aamer; Akhtar, Hashaam; Hussein, Ahmed Mohamud; Barkia, Abdelaziz; Hakim, Huda; Taha, Hana Ahmad; Hijjo, Yasser; Kamal, Ehab; Ahmed, Abdirizak Yusuf; Rahman, Fazalur; Islam, Khwaja Mir; Hussein, Moshtaq Hassan; Ramzi, Shahd Raid",Journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34642765/,223

Medical students frequenting hospitals are more susceptible to be infected by the virus but also able to see the effects of the pandemic from the frontline. The aim of this study was to assess the COVID-19 related knowledge, behavioral changes, and perceptions of Italian medical students within the first 90 days after the onset of the outbreak in Italy. A national cross-sectional study was conducted from 23rd April to 31st April 2020. Participants were Italian medical students whose knowledge, behavioral changes, and perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic were assessed. The survey consisted of: demographics, COVID-19 related general knowledge, behavioral changes, and perceptions of the pandemic. A total of 520 students answered the survey. The majority of the students' ages ranged from 21 to 25 years old (345, 66.3%). Only 48.6% stated that they had received a formal education about COVID-19 from their medical institutions. However, all the students declared that they tried to inform themselves, mostly through WHO, CDC, UpToDate (56%), but also (21.6%) through national guidelines, social networks (Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube) (11.5%), and other sources (10.9%). Italian medical students demonstrated a high level of COVID-19-related general knowledge as well as self-reported preventative behavioral changes but only had a moderate risk perception regarding the pandemic. They improved their health habits but questioned the reliability of information and handling of the pandemic by health authorities.","Wheeler, Dakota Russell; Chibbaro, Salvatore; Karoutis, Ioanna; Safa, Adrian; Tinterri, Benedetta; Calgaro, Giulio; Chung Yin, Wu; Zaed, Ismail",Pathogens and global health,https://doi.org/10.1080/20477724.2021.1878447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33522450/,223

We performed a scoping review, which maps the literature and considers inclusion of studies that are not specifically quantitative. DATA SOURCES We searched five databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library, ClinialTrials.gov) from inception through August 2018 using terms related to reproductive health care and religion. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION We screened 2,906 studies. Articles were included if in English, included primary research data, and referenced U.S.-based Catholic facilities. We reviewed the reference lists of included articles. We excluded articles that addressed the relationship of patient or health care provider religion to provision of reproductive services, described reproductive health care services in non-Catholic facilities, or reported legal cases or concerns. Two independent reviewers screened all citations, a third reviewer resolved differences, and all three reviewers categorized included citations. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS We included 27 studies. Investigators most commonly focused on the provision of emergency contraception (n=9) or other contraceptive and sterilization methods (n=7); few focused on a range of family planning methods (n=3), natural family planning (n=2), ectopic pregnancy management (n=2), abortion care (n=2), miscarriage management (n=1), and infertility care (n=1). The most common study designs were cross-sectional (18/27 [67%]) and qualitative investigations (6/27 [22%]). Common data collection approaches included surveys, interviews, and mystery caller designs. Two studies involved authors with Catholic hospital affiliations and one of these reported patient outcomes; no other patient outcome reports were found. Studies cited restrictions to care in comparison with non-Catholic settings and multisite studies demonstrated variable rates of provision of reproductive health services across Catholic sites. CONCLUSIONS Despite the significant proportion and recent growth of Catholic health care within the U.S. health care sector, little is known about reproductive health outcomes in these settings and in comparison with other settings.","Thorne, Nichole B; Soderborg, Taylor K; Glover, Jacqueline J; Hoffecker, Lilian; Guiahi, Maryam",Obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000003029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30531578/,223

METHODS A total of 362 cirrhotic patients were included retrospectively across four French centres (181 per treatment group). Global RFA failure (primary RFA failure or local tumour progression) was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method after coarsened exact matching. Cox regression models were used to identify factors associated with global RFA failure and overall survival (OS). RESULTS Patients were well matched according to tumour size (⩽30/>30mm); tumour number (one/several); tumour location (subcapsular and near large vessel); serum AFP (<10; 10-100; >100ng/ml); Child-Pugh score (A/B) and platelet count (⩾100G/L), p=1 for all. One case of perioperative mortality was observed in the NTmbpRFA group and the rate of major complications was 7.2% in both groups (p=1). The cumulative rates of global RFA failure at 1, 3 and 5years were respectively 13.3%, 31% and 36.7% for MonoRFA vs. 0.02%, 7.9% and 9.2% for NTmbpRFA, p<0.001. Monopolar RFA, tumour size >30mm and HCC near large vessel were independent factors associated with global RFA failure. Five-year OS was 37.2% following MonoRFA vs. 46.4% following NTmbpRFA p=0.378. CONCLUSIONS This large multicentre case-matched study showed that NTmbpRFA provided better primary RFA success and sustained local tumour response without increasing severe complications rates, for HCC ⩽5cm.

METHODS A total of 100 consecutive patients with midline incisional hernias were prospectively included in the study. Three groups according to the transverse diameter of the defect [group A (<4 cm, N = 18), group B (4-10 cm, N = 59), and group C (>10 cm, N = 23)] were identified. RESULTS Components separation was necessary in 54% of the patients: 16.7% (3/18) in group A, 59.3% (35/59) in group B, and 69.6% (16/23) in group C. Complete tension-free reconstruction was achieved in 87% of the patients: 94.4% (17/18) in group A, 91.5% (54/59) in group B, and 69.6% (16/23) in group C. Overall morbidity rate was 21% (21/100) [group A 16.7% (3/18), group B 22% (13/59), and group C 21.7% (5/23)]. Hospital length of stay was 3.7 ± 3.3 days (group A 1.83 ± 1.43 days, group B 3.05 ± 2.11 days, and group C 6.91 ± 4.45 days).

A lot of studies have investigated several techniques in order to reduce pancreatic fistula, but data on the effect of sutures material on pancreatic fistula are not available. The analysis investigated the role of suture material in influencing pancreatic fistula rate and severity. METHODS Results from 130 consecutive pancreaticoduodenectomy with pancreaticojejunostomy performed between March 2013 and September 2014 were prospectively collected and analyzed. In 65 cases pancreaticojejunostomy was performed with absorbable sutures, in the other 65 cases using non-absorbable sutures (polyester, silk and polybutester). RESULTS Pancreaticojejunostomy with non-absorbable sutures had the same incidence of pancreatic fistula, but less severe and with less episodes of post-operative bleeding if compared with absorbable sutures. A sub-analysis was carried out comparing polydioxanone with polyester: the latter was associated with a lower pancreatic fistula rate (11.9% vs. 31.7%; p = 0,01) and less severe pancreatic anastomosis dehiscence (grade C - 0% vs. 30%; p = 0.05). Univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed that hard pancreatic texture, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma at final histology and the use of polyester for pancreaticojejunostomy were associated with a lower pancreatic fistula rate (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of pancreatic juice and bile on different sutures and pancreatic tissue response to different materials. However, pancreaticojejunostomy performed with polyester sutures is safe and feasible and is associated to a lower incidence of pancreatic fistula with less severe clinical impact.","Andrianello, Stefano; Pea, Antonio; Pulvirenti, Alessandra; Allegrini, Valentina; Marchegiani, Giovanni; Malleo, Giuseppe; Butturini, Giovanni; Salvia, Roberto; Bassi, Claudio",Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ...

Dissemination is confined to the abdominal and pelvic peritoneal spaces in a great majority of patients. METHODS Standardized cytoreductive surgery and perioperative chemotherapy was used in all patients. Long-term normothermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (NIPEC) was added to the treatment of our most recent group of patients. Survival with and without NIPEC was compared using a propensity-matched analysis. RESULTS In a uniform group of 74 patients, the clinical- and treatment-related features that had an impact on survival were age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.929-4.238, p = 0.0766), completeness of cytoreduction (HR 2.356, 95% CI 1.113-4.989, p = 0.0251), and treatments administered (HR 3.497, 95% CI 1.199-10.20, p = 0.0219). In the Cox proportional hazards multivariant model, sex and age were borderline significant. Treatments administered were significant (HR 3.549, 95% CI 1.157-10.888, p = 0.0268). Using five features to match 29 patients in the control group (no NIPEC) to 29 patients in the experimental group (with NIPEC), the propensity-matched survival was significantly different (p = 0.0263).

131513,A Novel Method for Differential Prognosis of Brain Degenerative Diseases Using Radiomics-Based Textural Analysis and Ensemble Learning Classifiers.,2021,"BACKGROUND Compared to individuals without type 2 diabetes mellitus, the relative increase in cardiovascular mortality is much higher in women than in men in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS We evaluated data from 7443 individuals (3792 women, 50.9%), aged 20 to 81 years, from two independent population-based investigations, SHIP-0 and MONICA/KORA S3. We analyzed the longitudinal sex-specific associations of lipoprotein(a) with cardiovascular mortality in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus using Cox regression. RESULTS During a median follow-up of 20.5 years (136,802 person-years), 657 participants (404 men and 253 women) died of cardiovascular causes. Among individuals without type 2 diabetes mellitus, men had a significantly higher risk for cardiovascular mortality compared to women in unadjusted model and after adjustment. On the other hand, in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the risk for cardiovascular mortality was not different between men and women in the unadjusted model and after adjustment for age, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, fasting status and study sample (SHIP-0, MONICA/KORA S3). Further adjustment for lipoprotein(a) concentrations had no impact on the hazard ratio (HR) for cardiovascular mortality comparing men versus women in individuals without type 2 diabetes mellitus [HR: 1.94; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63 to 2.32; p < 0.001]. In individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus, however, further adjustment for lipoprotein(a) led to an increased risk for cardiovascular mortality in men and a decreased risk in women resulting in a statistically significant difference between men and women (HR: 1.53; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.24; p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS Women are described to have a stronger relative increase in cardiovascular mortality than men when comparing individuals with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Higher lipoprotein(a) concentrations in women with type 2 diabetes mellitus than in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus might partially explain this finding.","Markus, Marcello Ricardo Paulista; Ittermann, Till; Schipf, Sabine; Bahls, Martin; Nauck, Matthias; Völzke, Henry; Santos, Raul Dias; Peters, Annette; Zeller, Tanja; Felix, Stephan Burkhard; Vasan, Ramachandran S; Thorand, Barbara; Steinhagen-Thiessen, Elisabeth; Dörr, Marcus",Cardiovascular diabetology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12933-021-01363-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407812/,223

Delayed neurological injury involves perihematomal edema (PHE) formation. Infectious complications following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are a significant contributor to post-ICH recovery. We sought to identify a correlation between PHE volumes and infectious complications following ICH. We also sought to explore the clinical impact of this association. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study included 143 patients with spontaneous ICH. CT scans were performed on admission, and 3 h, 24 h, and 72 h following admission. Hematoma and PHE volumes were calculated using a semi-automatic method. The absolute PHE volume at each time point and changes in PHE volume (ΔPHE) were calculated. Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured from the obtained blood samples. Neurological deterioration (ND) was assessed in all patients. RESULTS Infectious complications were associated with ΔPHE72-24 (P < 0.01), whereas there was no association between infectious complications and ΔPHE24-3 (P = 0.09) or ΔPHE3-ad (P = 0.81). There was a positive correlation between ΔPHE72-24 and NLR (r = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.79-0.90, P < 0.01) and between ΔPHE72-24 and CRP levels (r = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.84-0.92, P < 0.01). The ND rate in the group of patients with infectious complications comorbid with high ΔPHE72-24 was higher than the other patient groups (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS This study revealed a correlation between ΔPHE72-24 and infectious complications after spontaneous ICH, which was associated with markers of systemic inflammation. This phenotype linkage is a negative cascade that drives ND.","Kashiwazaki, Daina; Tomita, Takahiro; Shibata, Takashi; Yamamoto, Shusuke; Hori, Emiko; Akioka, Naoki; Kuwayama, Naoya; Nakatsuji, Yuji; Noguchi, Kyo; Kuroda, Satoshi",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2021.105827; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932750/,223
132068,[Basic information of Coronavirus].,2020,"With the advancement of small watershed governance in agricultural production process, soil toxic element pollution issue in watersheds constitutes a recent research hot spot. The Ashi River watershed is an agriculture-dominated small watershed which is exposed to toxic element sources, posing high risk of toxic element pollution to the planting areas. In this study, collection of soil samples was carried out along the periphery of the river network, and the soil physicochemical parameters and toxic elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn) were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) The geo-accumulation index (Igeo) and potential ecological risk index were used to evaluate the pollution degree, and the contents of As, Cd, and Zn in some sampling sites exceeded risk screening values. Moreover, soils closer to mining sources were found to be more polluted; (2) Redundancy analysis confirmed the contribution rate relationship between environmental factors and toxic elements. C/N ratio, total carbon (C), and total potassium (K) exhibited significant relationships with toxic elements (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), respectively. Moreover, geographic locations (longitude, latitude, and elevation) showed significant impacts on toxic element contents (except for Cu); (3) The apportionment of toxic element pollution sources by using principal component analysis showed that Pb, Zn, Cu, and Cd were mainly related to mining activities, while As was closely related to insecticide and herbicide, and Cr was mainly related to soil parent material and electroplating factory; (4) Through the integrated resistance base surface and toxic element sources combined with minimum cumulative resistance model, the toxic element risk areas were identified. The middle reaches corresponded to the extremely high risk zone, which undeniably requires the strengthening of the environmental management.","Guo, Xiaomeng; Wang, Li; Ma, Fang; You, Yongqiang; Ju, Chang",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399335/,223

Such an ultra-minimally invasive technique is attractive to patients and may have clinical advantages because of the reduced number of abdominal incisions. However, because of its extreme geometrical challenges and instrument crowding, single-incision laparoscopy is such a major deviation from optimum surgical ergonomics that it is unlikely to gain popularity. Robot assistance in single-incision laparoscopy has recently been described for some ablative gynecologic procedures, and it seems to have technical advantages. However, no suture-intensive applications of this technique have yet been reported.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of OFA on post-operative morphine consumption and the post-operative course. METHODS After retrospectively registering to clinicaltrial.gov (NCT03816592), we performed a retrospective matched cohort study (1:1) on cardiac surgery patients with cardiopulmonary bypass between 2018 and 2019. Patients were divided into two groups: OFA (lidocaine, dexamethasone and ketamine) or opioid anaesthesia (OA) (sufentanil). The main outcome was the total postoperative morphine consumption in the 48 h after surgery. Secondary outcomes were rescue analgesic use, a major adverse event composite endpoint, and ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS). RESULTS One hundred ten patients were matched (OFA: n = 55; OA: n = 55). On inclusion, demographic and surgical data for the OFA and OA groups were comparable. The total morphine consumption was higher in the OA group than in the OFA group (15 (6-34) vs 5 mg (2-18), p = 0.001). The pain score during the first 48 post-operative hours did not differ between the two groups. Creatinine values did not differ on the first post-operative day (80 (IQR: 66-115) vs 77 mmol/l (IQR: 69-95), p = 0.284). Incidence of the composite endpoint was lower in the OFA group (25 patients (43%) vs 38 patients (68%), p = 0.021). The time to extubation and the ICU stays were shorter in the OFA group (3 (1-5) vs 5 (3-6) hours, p = 0.001 and 2 (1-3) vs 3 (2-5) days, p = 0.037). CONCLUSION The use of OFA was associated with lower morphine consumption. OFA might be associated with shorter intubation time and ICU stays. Further randomized studies are needed to confirm these results.

Due to the existence of multiple serotypes and variants of the virus that do not cross-protect, it is important to diagnose circulating serotypes and choose the right vaccine type for successful protection. In an effort to improve conventional diagnostic tests, a microsphere-based assay was developed and evaluated for simultaneous detection of the most common IBV vaccine serotypes in the United States: Arkansas (Ark), Connecticut (Conn), Massachusetts (Mass), Delaware (DE072), and Georgia 98 (GA98). The analytical specificity and sensitivity, and diagnostic specificity and sensitivity, were evaluated. The microsphere-based assay was highly specific to designated serotypes and generated reproducible data. Comparing the microsphere-based assay to nucleotide sequencing, the 2 methods agreed more than 93% (kappa value > .77). In addition, the microsphere-based assay could detect coinfections in clinical samples. The results demonstrate the utility of the microsphere-based assay as a rapid and accurate diagnostic tool with the potential for high throughput diagnosis.","Roh, Ha-Jung; Hilt, Deborah A; Jackwood, Mark W","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638713493906; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23847226/,223

134741,From the Editors.,2017,"BACKGROUND Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is one of the most common types of chronic neuropathic pain, which seriously affects quality of the life because of pain severity and poor response to the currently available treatments. The main strategies for PHN management are medication and invasive interventional therapies; however, these approaches have many adverse effects, so it is important to find another effective and safe treatment for PHN. METHODS A single-center, single-blind randomized clinical trial will evaluate 98 study participants randomized in a 1:1 ratio into control and experimental groups. The control group will receive conventional treatment including medication therapy and invasive interventional therapy. The experimental group will receive extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) in addition to conventional therapy. The primary outcome is pain intensity assessed on a visual analogue scale (VAS); the secondary outcomes are the following: quality of life assessed by the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), psychological state for anxiety and depression measured by the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Assessors blinded to the randomization will collect data during the intervention period at baseline and weeks 1, 4, and 12. The plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 will be assessed before and after ESWT to explore the biochemical mechanisms of ESWT in the treatment of PHN. DISCUSSION This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ESWT in patients with PHN and thus will provide clinical evidence for its use in the management of PHN and explore the potential biochemical mechanisms of this treatment.

While clear classifications and validated measures of burnout exist, documentation burden remains ill-defined and inconsistently measured. We aim to conduct a scoping review focused on identifying approaches to documentation burden measurement and their characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS Based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews (ScR) guidelines, we conducted a scoping review assessing MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL from inception to April 2020 for studies investigating documentation burden among physicians and nurses in ambulatory or inpatient settings. Two reviewers evaluated each potentially relevant study for inclusion/exclusion criteria. RESULTS Of the 3482 articles retrieved, 35 studies met inclusion criteria. We identified 15 measurement characteristics, including 7 effort constructs: EHR usage and workload, clinical documentation/review, EHR work after hours and remotely, administrative tasks, cognitively cumbersome work, fragmentation of workflow, and patient interaction. We uncovered 4 time constructs: average time, proportion of time, timeliness of completion, activity rate, and 11 units of analysis. Only 45.0% of studies assessed the impact of EHRs on clinicians and/or patients and 40.0% mentioned clinician burnout. DISCUSSION Standard and validated measures of documentation burden are lacking. While time and effort were the core concepts measured, there appears to be no consensus on the best approach nor degree of rigor to study documentation burden. CONCLUSION Further research is needed to reliably operationalize the concept of documentation burden, explore best practices for measurement, and standardize its use.","Moy, Amanda J; Schwartz, Jessica M; Chen, RuiJun; Sadri, Shirin; Lucas, Eugene; Cato, Kenrick D; Rossetti, Sarah Collins",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33434273/,223
138241,Update on voluntary assisted dying in Australia.,2021-06-23,"BACKGROUND It is common practice to observe patients during an overnight stay (ONS) following a catheter ablation procedure for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). OBJECTIVES To investigate the safety and economic impact of a same day discharge (SDD) protocol after cryoballoon ablation for treatment of AF in high-volume, geographically diverse US hospitals. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 2,374 consecutive patients (1,119 SDD and 1,180 ONS) who underwent cryoballoon ablation for AF at three US centers. Baseline characteristics, acute procedure-related complications, and longer-term evaluations of safety were recorded during routine clinical follow-up. The mean cost of an ONS was used in a one-way sensitivity analysis to evaluate yearly cost savings as a function of the percentage of SDD cases per year. RESULTS The SDD and ONS cohorts were predominately male (69% versus 67%; p=0.3), but SDD patients were younger (64±11 versus 66±10; p< 0.0001) with lower BMI (30±6 versus 31±61; p< 0.0001) and CHA2 DS2 -VASc scores (1.4±1.0 versus 2.2±1.4; p< 0.0002). There was no difference between SDD and ONS in the 30-day total complication rate [n=15 (1.26%) versus n=24 (2.03%); p=0.136 respectively]. The most common complication was hematoma in both the SDD (n=8; 0.67%) and ONS (n=11; 0.93%) cohorts. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that when 50% of every 100 patients treated were discharged the same day, hospital cost savings ranged from $45,825 to $83,813 per year across US hospitals. CONCLUSIONS SDD following cryoballoon ablation for AF appears to be safe and is associated with cost savings across different US hospitals. This article is protected by copyright.

Based on this evidence, there have been calls for more inclusive approaches to leadership in healthcare settings, but guidance on how to achieve collective leadership is lacking. This study synthesised knowledge of interventions to introduce collectivistic leadership in healthcare settings. METHODS The databases of PubMed, PsychInfo, ABI Inform, Cochrane and CINAHL and three grey literature databases were searched. Studies from any country were included if they reported on the development and evaluation and/or implementation of training/interventions to develop collectivistic leadership and reported individual and/or team-level outcomes. Results were synthesised using a narrative approach. RESULTS The searches yielded 4448 records of which 21 met the eligibility criteria and were reviewed. Studies used a variety of interventions; eleven employed a team training approach, four described co-leadership, three explored service improvement, two detailed co-design approaches and one described an individual team development intervention. Most demonstrated moderate to good success in enabling collectivistic leadership, with benefits reported in staff engagement, satisfaction, and team performance.

METHODS We evaluated the association between CSF levels of 18 cytokines, previously found to be associated to grey matter damage, and the disease activity, among 99 relapsing-remitting MS patients, who underwent blinded clinical and 3T-MRI evaluations for 4 years. Groups with (EDA) or without (NEDA) evidence of disease activity (occurrence of relapses, new white matter lesions, EDSS change) were identified. Cortical lesions and the annualized cortical thinning were also evaluated. RESULTS Fortyone patients experienced EDA and, compared to the NEDA group, had at diagnosis higher CSF levels of CXCL13, CXCL12, IFNγ, TNF, sCD163, LIGHT and APRIL (p<0.001). In the multivariate analysis, CXCL13 (HR=1.35, p=0.0002), LIGHT (HR=1.22, p=0.005) and APRIL (HR=1.78, p=0.0001) were the CSF molecules more strongly associated with the risk of EDA. The model including CSF variables predicted more accurately the occurrence of disease activity than the model with only clinical/MRI parameters (C-index at 4 years= 71% vs 44%). Finally, higher CSF levels of CXCL13 (β=4.7*10-4 ,p<0.001), TNF (β=3.1*10-3 ,p=0.004), LIGHT (β=2.6*10-4 ,p=0.003), sCD163 (β=4.3*10-3 ,p=0.009) and TWEAK (β=3.4*10-3 ,p=0.024) were associated with more severe cortical thinning. INTERPRETATION A specific CSF profile, mainly characterized by elevated levels of B-cell related cytokines, distinguishes patients at high risk of disease activity and severe cortical damage.

This study was designed to determine the association between widespread pain, a common subtype of chronic pain, and subsequent dementia, Alzheimer's disease dementia and stroke. METHODS This retrospective cohort study used data from the US community-based Framingham Heart Study. Pain status was assessed at a single time point between 1990 and 1994. Widespread pain was determined based on the Framingham Heart Study pain homunculus. Dementia follow-up occurred across a median of 10 years (IQR, 6-13 years) for persons who were dementia free at baseline. Proportional hazard models examined associations between widespread pain and incident dementia, Alzheimer's disease dementia and stroke. RESULTS A total of 347 (14.1%) subjects fulfilled the criteria for widespread pain, whereas 2117 (85.9%) subjects did not. Of 188 cases of incident all-cause dementia, 128 were Alzheimer's disease dementia. In addition, 139 patients suffered stroke during the follow-up period. After multivariate adjustment including age and sex, widespread pain was associated with 43% increase in all-cause dementia risk (HR: 1.43; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.92), 47% increase in Alzheimer's disease dementia risk (HR: 1.47; 95% CI 1.13 to 2.20) and 29% increase in stroke risk (HR: 1.29; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.54). Comparable results were shown in the subgroup of individuals over 65 years old. CONCLUSION Widespread pain was associated with an increased incidence of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease dementia and stroke.

Positive thinking and resilience were identified as mediators between 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) victimization experiences and mental health. METHOD The sample included 384 from 4 universities in Wuhan, China. Four structured instruments were applied to the college students, including scale of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus victimization experience, scale of the positive thinking, scale of the resilience, and scale of the mental health. The responses were scored using a 5-point Likert scale. Structural equation models were used to construct measurement and structural models. RESULTS The findings confirmed that the 2019-nCoV victimization experience was a negative predictor of mental health; positive thinking and resilience were strong mediators between 2019-nCoV victimization experience and mental health. CONCLUSIONS The results indicated that a complete model was significant because positive thinking compensated for resilience. Notably, these 2 strong mediators will vastly resist the negative influences of 2019-nCoV victimization experience on mental health in Wuhan's college students until the end of the pandemic.

142104,Could vets manage Covid-19 better?,2020-05-16,"Objective To carry out a systematic review of the effect of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) and its components on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with stable angina. Methods We searched the databases including Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and EBSCO CINAHL from their inception up to November 1, 2017. The search was not restricted to time or publication status but was limited to the English language. Two independent investigators screened the identified studies and extracted the data in duplicate. We reviewed the included studies and, where possible, pooled their results and conducted meta-analyses. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane Collaboration tools. Results The search identified 7508 studies. Ten randomized trials including 4005 participants with the mean (SD) age of 59.6 (5.7) years were considered eligible for inclusion in our analyses. The results of meta-analyses of exercise-based CR for patients with stable angina revealed that CR improved exercise capacity (the difference between baseline and follow-up was 0.76 watt [0.49 to 1.02] higher in the CR group vs the non-CR group) and decreased angina frequency (standard mean difference, -0.27 [CI, -0.43 to 0.11]). No significant differences were noted in other outcomes, including quality of life. Mortality could not be adequately assessed because it was analyzed in only 1 exercise-based CR study. Conclusion Our systematic review, involving a relatively small number of studies with low to moderate risk of bias and with considerable heterogeneity, found a significant decrease in angina frequency and increase in exercise capacity in patients with stable angina who participated in an exercise-based CR program. Studies involving the impact of components of CR are limited and generally report beneficial outcomes. Additional studies are needed to clarify the possible role of CR in the management of patients with stable angina.","Saeidifard, Farzane; Wang, Yanhui; Medina-Inojosa, Jose R; Squires, Ray W; Huang, Hsu-Hang; Thomas, Randal J","Mayo Clinic proceedings.

We discuss examples of technological developments across the four stages of the recruitment and selection process. In the attraction stage we discuss how on-line/internet recruitment and especially social networking websites have changed dramatically the focus of attracting candidates effectively. In the next stage of screening, we discuss how cybervetting and applicant tracking systems offer opportunities but also threats for recruiters and candidates. In the third stage of employee selection, we focus especially on two new selection methods; the asynchronous/digital interview and gamification/games-based assessment, along with the critical role and impact applicant reactions have on the selection process. Finally, we briefly discuss the main technological developments in on-boarding and socialization, and we conclude with a few suggestions for future research in this field.","Nikolaou, Ioannis",The Spanish journal of psychology,https://doi.org/10.1017/sjp.2021.6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33536110/,223
143279,Presentation and management of keloid scarring following median sternotomy: a case study.,2010,"BACKGROUND Information is lacking about the severity of complications in children with influenza admitted to paediatric intensive care units (PICU) in the UK. In this study, we report risk factors for mortality, invasive ventilation and use of vasoactive drugs for children admitted to PICU with influenza. METHODS We evaluated all admissions to PICUs in England for resident children with a recorded influenza diagnosis between September 2003 and March 2015. We used the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANet) database linked to hospital admission records to identify influenza cases, and high-risk comorbidities among admitted children. We used mixed effects logistic regression models to determine risk factors for mortality, use of invasive ventilation and vasoactive drugs. RESULTS We identified 1961 influenza-related PICU admissions in 1778 children. Children with high-risk conditions accounted for 1540 admissions (78.5%). The odds of mortality were significantly higher for girls than boys (adjusted odds ratio 1.91; 95% confidence interval 1.31, 2.79), children from Asian/Asian British (2.70; 1.74, 4.20) or other minority ethnic groups (3.95; 1.65, 9.42) compared to white British children, and significantly increased before and during the A(H1N1)pdm 2009 pandemic compared to the post-pandemic period. Children required invasive ventilation in 1588 admissions (81.0%), and received vasoactive drugs in 586 admissions (29.9%). CONCLUSIONS Nearly four fifths of influenza-related PICU admissions occurred in children with high-risk conditions, highlighting the burden of severe influenza in this vulnerable population Further research is required to explain sex and ethnic group differences in PICU mortality among children admitted with influenza.","Hardelid, Pia; Kapetanstrataki, Melpo; Norman, Lee; Fleming, Sarah J; Lister, Paula; Gilbert, Ruth; Parslow, Roger C",Respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2018.02.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29605208/,223

Unprecedented Times and Lessons Learned.,2020-10-27,"Notified cases of COVID-19 and associated deaths reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) to 5 July 2020. Cumulative confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 5 July 2020: notifications = 8,566, deaths = 106. Over the past fortnightly reporting period (22 June to 5 July), 897 cases were notified, with 4 deaths. The national incidence of COVID-19 remained low, with very few cases reported by most jurisdictions in this reporting period. The majority of the current cases reported over this fortnight are from Victoria, with an increasing number and proportion of cases reported as being locally acquired. Total case numbers have increased with an average of 54 cases reported on any one day, more than twice the average number reported in the previous reporting period. The number and proportion of deaths associated with COVID-19 remains low and it appears that vulnerable populations have not been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 overall. Testing rates continue to be high across all jurisdictions, with the nationwide positivity rate remaining very low at less than 0.3%. In this reporting period, the number of cases reported nationally has increased from 214 (8 June to 21 June) to 897 (22 June to 5 July). Of the cases notified in this reporting period, 87% (781 cases) were notified from Victoria and 89% of these cases were acquired locally. Of the remaining 116 cases reported from other jurisdictions only 6% were locally acquired. The increase in Victoria is attributable to multiple epidemiologically linked outbreaks across a range of settings and locations. A small proportion of cases have experienced severe disease, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care, with some fatalities. The crude case fatality rate amongst Australian cases is 1.2%.

145305,Evaluation of Hot-air Drying to Inactivate Salmonella spp. and Enterococcus faecium on Apple Pieces.,2020-09-25,"Chronic pain is a highly prevalent medical problem in the United States. Although opioids and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have demonstrated efficacy for relief of chronic pain, each has risks of adverse events in patients. Because of the risk of opioid abuse and addiction, combinations reducing opioid requirements are particularly valuable. Opioid and SNRI agents relieve pain by different pathways; concurrent use of each agent separately offers many potential benefits: complementary and possibly synergistic analgesic efficacy, separate titrations of opioid and SNRI effects, and the reduction of opioid requirements. However, few clinical studies have investigated the ideal ratios for combinations of opioids and SNRIs. A number of factors affect whether specific combinations have additive, synergistic, less than additive efficacy, or increase adverse events in patients, including general pharmacokinetic considerations, the potential for pharmacodynamic drug interactions, dose, and timing. Because there is little clinical evidence guiding combination therapy with separate opioid and SNRI agents, using single-molecule agents provides safe and effective therapy and should be the first option presented to patients. The use of empiric combinations of separate opioid and SNRI combinations needs to be considered in light of clinical cautions, including the lack of published evidence to guide dose conversion from any opioid to tramadol or to tapentadol, and vice versa; the need to avoid combinations with known drug interactions; and the need to titrate the dose when adding an SNRI to an opioid, and vice versa.","Smith, Howard S; Raffa, Robert B; Pergolizzi, Joseph V; Taylor, Robert; Tallarida, Ronald J",Postgraduate medicine,https://doi.org/10.3810/pgm.2014.07.2788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25141248/,223

Over 40 large clinical trials for ALS have been negative, except for Riluzole that offers a modest survival benefit, and Edaravone that modestly reduces disease progression in patients with specific characteristics. Thus, the discovery of efficient disease modifying therapy is an urgent need. AREAS COVERED Although the cause of ALS remains unclear, many studies have demonstrated that neuroinflammation, proteinopathies, glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, microglial activation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction may play a key role in the pathogenesis. This review highlights recent discoveries relating to these diverse mechanisms and their implications for the development of therapy. Ongoing phase 2 clinical trials aimed to interfere with these pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed. EXPERT OPINION This review describes the challenges that the discovery of an efficient drug therapy faces and how these issues may be addressed. With the continuous advances coming from basic research, we provided possible suggestions that may be considered to improve performance of clinical trials and turn ALS research into a 'fertile ground' for drug development for this devastating disease.","Barp, Andrea; Gerardi, Francesca; Lizio, Andrea; Sansone, Valeria Ada; Lunetta, Christian",Expert opinion on emerging drugs,https://doi.org/10.1080/14728214.2020.1769067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32456491/,223

METHODOLOGY Cross-sectional study with data from a web-based behavioral survey carried out from April 24 to May 24, 2020, with 45,161 participants recruited by the chain sampling method. A descriptive analysis of the survey topics was performed: adherence to social restriction measures, diagnosis of the new coronavirus, work situation and income, difficulties in routine activities, presence of comorbidities, psychological issues, and access to health services. Prevalence and respective 95% confidence intervals were estimated. RESULTS Approximately 74% of Brazilians adhered to social restrictions. As for flu symptoms, 28.1% reported having at least one flu symptom, but only 5.9% underwent testing for COVID-19. Regarding the socioeconomic impact, 55.1% reported a decrease in family income, and 7.0% were left without any income; 25.8% of the people lost their jobs, with the group of informal workers being the most affected (50.6%). As for health conditions, 29.4% reported worsening of health status; 45%, having sleep problems; 40% frequently presented feelings of sadness, and 52.5%, of anxiety; 21.7% sought health care, and, among them, 13.9% did not get care.

The mechanisms include oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, reduction of neurotrophic factors, insulin resistance, excessive amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition and Tau phosphorylation. Both antidiabetic and neuroprotective effects of the phytoestrogen genistein have been reported. However, the beneficial effect of genistein in brain of the ob/ob mouse model of severe obesity and diabetes remains to be determined. Methods In this study, female ob/ob mice and lean control mice were fed with either a standard diet or a diet containing genistein (600mg/kg) for a period of 4 weeks. Body weight was monitored weekly. Blood was collected for the measurement of glucose, insulin and common cytokines. Mice brains were isolated for Western immunoblotting analyses. Results Treatment with genistein reduced weight gain of ob/ob mice and decreased hyperglycemia compared to ob/ob mice fed the standard diet. The main findings show that genistein treatment increased insulin sensitivity and the expression levels of the neurotrophic factors nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF). In these mice, genistein also reduced Aβ deposition and the level of hyper-phosphorylated Tau protein. Conclusion The results of our study indicate the beneficial effects of genistein in the obese diabetic mouse brain, including improving brain insulin signaling, increasing neurotrophic support, and alleviating Alzheimer's disease-related pathology.","Li, Rong-Zi; Ding, Xiao-Wen; Geetha, Thangiah; Al-Nakkash, Layla; Broderick, Tom L; Babu, Jeganathan Ramesh","Drug design, development and therapy",https://doi.org/10.2147/dddt.s249608; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32884237/,223

SOCE amplitude, monitored in whole-cell voltage clamped cells, was markedly reduced (60-70%) in all conditions, with full reversibility within 4h. Silencing of Orai and STIM1 using siRNA resulted in a large inhibition of SOCE (70-80%) whereas siSTIM2 had a smaller but significant effect (30%). However, the cell population doubling time was not affected in siSTIM1 cells (18 h, the same as in control cells) but was increased in both siOrai1 cells (29 h) and in siSTIM2 (23 h) even when combined with siSTIM1. This suggests that STIM1 plays no role in cell proliferation in HEK293 cells while STIM2 is involved in both SOCE and cell proliferation in these cells. Finally, the cell cycle block induced SOCE inhibition was associated with reduced Orai1 expression with full recovery within 4h, whereas the expression of STIM1 and STIM2 remained unaltered. These observations reveal a tight relation between cell proliferation, calcium entry and Orai1 expression in HEK293 cells.","El Boustany, Charbel; Katsogiannou, Maria; Delcourt, Philippe; Dewailly, Etienne; Prevarskaya, Natalia; Borowiec, Anne-Sophie; Capiod, Thierry",Cell calcium,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceca.2010.01.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20172609/,223

The first webinar debated the lessons we are learning from the Covid-19 pandemic for radiological risk communication, the second explored issues around longer-term outcomes of a crisis and how to balance these with short-term actions whilst the third focused on the key challenges of the 'transition phase', using learning from Chernobyl (1986) and Fukushima Daichii (2011) accidents. This paper reviews the discussion and provides valuable lessons for the radiation protection community. Results of the discussion indicated that: i) non-radiological and non-epidemiological consequences of emergencies, e.g. psychological (mental health), societal and economic, should not be underestimated; ii) multidisciplinary expertise is imperative for communication efforts and for effective emergency management, including decision-making in the application of protective measures; iii) stakeholder engagement, including the involvement of the potentially affected population, should be encouraged from an early stage and iv) trust is increased if policy-makers and main science agencies show a unified voice.","Martell, Meritxell; Perko, Tanja; Zeleznik, Nadja; Molyneux-Hodgson, Susan",Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6498/abd841; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33395668/,223

In the current study, we investigate the underlying neural sources of these responses and test the hypothesis that they can be directly modulated by changes in speech intelligibility. MEG responses were measured to natural and spectrally degraded (noise-vocoded) speech in 19 normal hearing participants. Results showed that cortical coherence to ""abstract"" linguistic units with no accompanying acoustic cues (phrases and sentences) were lateralized to the left hemisphere and changed parametrically with intelligibility of speech. In contrast, responses coherent to words/syllables accompanied by acoustic onsets were bilateral and insensitive to intelligibility changes. This dissociation suggests that cerebral responses to linguistic information are directly affected by intelligibility but also powerfully shaped by physical cues in speech. This explains why previous studies have reported widely inconsistent effects of speech intelligibility on cortical entrainment and, within a single experiment, provided clear support for conclusions about language lateralization derived from a large number of separately conducted neuroimaging studies. Since noise-vocoded speech resembles the signals provided by a cochlear implant device, the current methodology has potential clinical utility for assessment of cochlear implant performance.","Meng, Qingqing; Hegner, Yiwen Li; Giblin, Iain; McMahon, Catherine; Johnson, Blake W",Cerebral cortex,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhaa245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901245/,223

RESULTS In models represented by fixed partial dentures supported by dental implants and a natural tooth, the maximum tensile stresses arise in the cortical bone in the cervical region of the artificial crown, and the maximum compressive stresses occur both in the cortical layer in the cervical region of the artificial crown and in the cervical region of the tooth. In models with two fixed partial dentures supported by dental implants or two natural teeth, the stress distributions in the cortical layers in the upper and lower jaw are almost identical.

149539,In silico identification of vaccine targets for 2019-nCoV.,2020,"INTRODUCTION Total gastrectomy (TG) is commonly performed for the treatment of patients with gastric cancer. However, reconstruction of the esophagojejunal (EJ) anastomosis can be technically demanding, with reported anastomotic leak rates in the Western world still approaching 10-15%. We report our experience using the transoral anvil delivery system (OrVil™) for creation of the EJ anastomosis after TG. METHODS From 2007 to 2011, 48 consecutive patients with gastric cancer underwent open (n=31) or laparoscopic (n=17) TG. EJ reconstruction was performed with the transoral anvil deliver system (OrVil™) in an end-to-side fashion. Demographic, clinic, and perioperative data were obtained from a prospectively maintained database. RESULTS Of the 48 patients, 83% were male. Median age at resection was 64 years. Median body mass index was 27.1 kg/m2. Seventy-nine percent (n=38) of patients had at least one comorbidity. Fifteen patients (31%) had at least one perioperative complication. There was one perioperative death (2%) following a duodenal stump leak. There were four EJ leaks (8%) and two EJ stenoses (independent of leak; 4%). There was one EJ leak (6%) and one EJ stenosis (6%) following a case that was first attempted laparoscopically. There were no deaths as a consequence of an EJ leak. CONCLUSIONS The use of the transoral anvil delivery system during EJ reconstruction is a safe and effective option for reconstruction after open or laparoscopic TG with acceptable mortality and morbidity. The anastomotic leak rate appears to be comparable to that of other techniques.","LaFemina, J; Viñuela, E F; Schattner, M A; Gerdes, H; Strong, V E",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-013-2978-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23584558/,223

However, the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 has not been fully understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 shedding in excreta of COVID-19 patients. METHODS Electronical medical records, including demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiological findings, of enrolled patients were extracted and analyzed. Pharyngeal swab, stool and urine specimens were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. Viral shedding at multiple time points in specimens was recorded, and analyzed its correlation with clinical manifestations and the severity of illness. RESULTS A total of 42 laboratory-confirmed patients were enrolled, 8 (19.05%) of whom had gastrointestinal symptoms. 28 (66.67%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens, which was not associated with the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the severity of illness. Among them, 18 (64.29%) patients remained positive for viral RNA in feces after pharyngeal swabs turned negative. The duration of viral shedding from feces after negative conversion in pharyngeal swabs was 7 (6-10) days, regardless of COVID-19 severity. The demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and radiologic findings did no differ between patients tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces. Viral RNA was not detectable in urine specimens from 10 patients. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces of COVID-19 patients, and suggested the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via the fecal-oral route.

Despite this, the mechanisms of change for such interventions are only beginning to be understood, with a number of recent studies assessing changes in brain activity. The aim of this systematic review was to assess changes in brain functioning associated with manualised 8-session mindfulness interventions. Searches of PubMed and Scopus databases resulted in 39 papers, 7 of which were eligible for inclusion. The most consistent longitudinal effect observed was increased insular cortex activity following mindfulness-based interventions. In contrast to previous reviews, we did not find robust evidence for increased activity in specific prefrontal cortex sub-regions. These findings suggest that mindfulness interventions are associated with changes in functioning of the insula, plausibly impacting awareness of internal reactions 'in-the-moment'. The studies reviewed here demonstrated a variety of effects across populations and tasks, pointing to the need for greater consistency in future study design.","Young, Katherine S; van der Velden, Anne Maj; Craske, Michelle G; Pallesen, Karen Johanne; Fjorback, Lone; Roepstorff, Andreas; Parsons, Christine E",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28797556/,223

153638,Centering inclusivity in the design of online conferences-An OHBM-Open Science perspective.,2021-08-20,"BACKGROUND Sedentary time poses a risk to health. Substituting physical activity for inactivity is obvious but this requires a behavior change. Interventions advocated to decrease uninterrupted physical inactivity (defined as Metabolic Equivalent of Task (METS) less than 1.5) are important. One such intervention is accomplished with the Gentle Jogger (GJ), a low risk motorized wellness device which produces effortless, rapid motion of the lower extremities simulating locomotion or fidgeting. GJ produces health benefits in type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. The purpose of this trial was to ascertain whether GJ increases METS above 1.5 to explain its effectiveness despite sedentary behavior or whether tapping is responsible. METHODS A randomized single-arm trial was conducted. Subjects were randomized to begin the study in either the supine or seated postures and on the same day crossed over with the starting posture reversed. Oxygen consumption was measured at rest and during GJ. RESULTS Twenty-six subjects were studied (15 women and 11 men) with a mean age of 44 ± 15 years and BMI 27.9 ± 5.0, 19 were overweight or obese, and 7 had normal BMI. GJ increased oxygen consumption and METS 15% in the seated posture and 13% in the supine posture. No individual receiving GJ achieved METS exceeding 1.5. CONCLUSIONS In a moderately obese population, GJ in seated or supine posture did not exceed 1.5 METS. The values are comparable to those reported for sit-stand interventions and cannot explain the health benefits of GJ. TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03602365 .

We report on first experience with laparoscopic transperitoneal and retroperitoneoscopic single-incision adrenalectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between September 2009 and February 2010, eight patients underwent single-incision adrenalectomy. Four patients received single-incision retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy, and four patients transperitoneal single-incision laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Technical feasibility and perioperative data are presented. RESULTS All patients had benign adrenal tumors (Conn's adenoma, n = 7; pheochromocytoma, n = 1). Tumor size ranged between 1.2 and 2.4 cm. Mean operation time was 76 minutes for single-incision retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy and 82 minutes for single-incision laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Blood loss was irrelevant in both groups. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision adrenalectomy is safe and feasible in appropriate operation time, both by the retroperitoneoscopic technique and by the laparoscopic technique. It is also associated with good cosmetic outcome.","Agha, Ayman; Hornung, Matthias; Iesalnieks, Igors; Glockzin, Gabriel; Schlitt, Hans J",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2010.0238; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20849304/,223
156988,Mapping the scientific research on wine and health (2001-2011).,2013,"The HIV/AIDS pandemic still represents an important global health issue. There is no sterilizing cure, therefore a continuous treatment is necessary, which caused the emerged idea of HIV as a chronic inflammatory disease that may also affect healthy aging. Considering that the activation profile of some innate cells such as natural killer cells has previously been associated to HIV progression, it remains to be better defined this activation status of NK cells considering the time of HIV infection. In this study, we characterized NK cell phenotype and function during acute and chronic HIV infection and also investigated markers of immunosenescence in these cells. Our results showed that chronic infected patients remained with elevated levels of some plasma inflammatory molecules (IP-10, sCD14) and a concurrent expansion of the non-functional NK cell subset (CD3-CD56-CD16+). NK cells from the chronic infected group displayed an activated profile with higher levels of cytokines and chemokines production (TNF-α, IL-12, IFN-α2, IFN-γ, IL-6, RANTES, MCP-1, IL-10, IL-4 and IL-5). The production of these molecules was positively correlated to the time of infection. Moreover, we noted a possible association of higher global DNA methylation frequency of NK cells in two HIV patients in the advanced stage of disease. Chronic infected patients also showed a trend towards higher production of reactive oxygen species by their NK cells which altogether suggest the evolution of these cells to a senescent state that might be further evaluated.","Soares, Luana Silva; Espíndola, Milena Sobral; Zambuzi, Fabiana Albani; Galvão-Lima, Leonardo Judson; Cacemiro, Maira Costa; Soares, Murilo Racy; Santana, Bárbara A; Calado, Rodrigo T; Bollela, Valdes Roberto; Frantz, Fabiani Gai",International immunopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408187/,223
157059,"The future of conferences, today: Are virtual conferences a viable supplement to ""live"" conferences?",2020-06-08,"UNLABELLED The N-terminal region of simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) nonstructural polyprotein 1a is predicted to encode three papain-like proteases (PLP1α, PLP1β, and PLP1γ). Catalytic residues and cleavage sites for each of the SHFV PLP1s were predicted by alignment of the SHFV PLP1 region sequences with each other as well as with those of other arteriviruses, and the predicted catalytic residues were shown to be proximal by homology modeling of the SHFV nsp1s on porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) nsp1 crystal structures. The functionality of the predicted catalytic Cys residues and cleavage sites was tested by analysis of the autoproteolytic products generated in in vitro transcription/translation reactions done with wild-type or mutant SHFV nsp1 constructs. Cleavage sites were also analyzed by mass spectroscopy analysis of selected immunoprecipitated cleavage products. The data showed that each of the three SHFV PLP1s is an active protease. Cys63 was identified as the catalytic Cys of SHFV PLP1α and is adjacent to an Ala instead of the canonical Tyr observed in other arterivirus PLP1s. SHFV PLP1γ is able to cleave at both downstream and upstream nsp1 junction sites. Although intermediate precursor polyproteins as well as alternative products generated by each of the SHFV PLP1s cleaving at sites within the N-terminal region of nsp1β were produced in the in vitro reactions, Western blotting of SHFV-infected, MA104 cell lysates with SHFV nsp1 protein-specific antibodies detected only the three mature nsp1 proteins. IMPORTANCE SHFV is unique among arteriviruses in having three N-terminal papain-like protease 1 (PLP1) domains. Other arteriviruses encode one or two active PLP1s. This is the first functional study of the SHFV PLP1s. Analysis of the products of in vitro autoprocessing of an N-terminal SHFV nonstructural 1a polypeptide fragment showed that each of the three SHFV PLP1s is active, and the predicted catalytic Cys residues and cleavage sites for each PLP1 were confirmed by testing mutant constructs. Several unique features of the SHFV PLP1s were discovered. The SHFV PLP1α catalytic Cys63 is unique among arterivirus PLP1s in being adjacent to an Ala instead of a Trp. Other arterivirus PLP1s cleave only in cis at a single downstream site, but SHFV PLP1γ can cleave at both the downstream nsp1γ-nsp2 and upstream nsp1β-nsp1γ junctions. The three mature nsp1 proteins were produced both in the in vitro reactions and in infected cells.","Vatter, Heather A; Di, Han; Donaldson, Eric F; Radu, Gertrud U; Maines, Taronna R; Brinton, Margo A",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01020-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24899184/,223

In addition to genetics, the enduring influence of environmental factors in programming neural networks is of increased interest in assessing the underpinnings of mental health. The duration of daylight or photoperiod is known to impact both the serotonin and dopamine systems, which are implicated in mood and reward-based disorders. This review first examines the effects of circadian disruption and photoperiod in the serotonin system in both human and preclinical studies. We next highlight how brain regions crucial for the serotoninergic system (i.e., dorsal raphe nucleus; DRN), and dopaminergic (i.e., nucleus accumbens; NAc and ventral tegmental area; VTA) system are intertwined in overlapping circuitry, and play influential roles in the pathology of mood and reward-based disorders. We then focus on human and animal studies that demonstrate the impact of circadian factors on the dopaminergic system. Lastly, we discuss how environmental factors such as circadian photoperiod can impact the neural circuits that are responsible for regulating affective and reward states, offering novel insights into the biological mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology, systems, and therapeutic treatments necessary for mood and reward-based disorders.","Siemann, Justin K; Grueter, Brad A; McMahon, Douglas G",Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2020.12.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385488/,223

Such transitions can be governed by local equilibrium thermodynamics or by active processes controlled by biological fuel. It remains largely unexplored how the behavior of phase-separating systems with molecular transitions differs between thermodynamic equilibrium and cases where detailed balance of the molecular transition rates is broken due to the presence of fuel. Here, we present a model of a phase-separating ternary mixture where two components can convert into each other. At thermodynamic equilibrium, we find that molecular transitions can give rise to a lower dissolution temperature and thus reentrant phase behavior. Moreover, we find a discontinuous thermodynamic phase transition in the composition of the droplet phase if both converting molecules attract themselves with similar interaction strength. Breaking detailed-balance of the molecular transition leads to quasi-discontinuous changes in droplet composition by varying the fuel amount for a larger range of inter-molecular interactions. Our findings showcase that phase separation with molecular transitions provides a versatile mechanism to control properties of intra-cellular and synthetic condensates via discontinuous switches in droplet composition.","Bartolucci, Giacomo; Adame-Arana, Omar; Zhao, Xueping; Weber, Christoph A",Biophysical journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2021.09.036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34600899/,223

Repopulation of decellularized scaffolds with recipient cells provides a theoretical solution, allowing reliable and timely organ sourcing without the need for immunosuppression. Recellularisation of the vasculature of decellularised liver scaffolds was investigated as an essential pre-requisite to the survival of other parenchymal components. Liver decellularisation was carried out by portal vein perfusion using a detergent-based solution. Decellularised scaffolds were placed in a sterile perfusion apparatus consisting of a sealed organ chamber, functioning at 37°C in normal atmospheric conditions. The scaffold was perfused via portal vein with culture medium. A total of 107 primary cultured bone marrow stem-cells, selected by plastic adherence, were infused into the scaffold, after which repopulated scaffolds were perfused for up to 30 days. The cultured stem cells were assessed for key marker expression using FACS and recellularised scaffolds were analysed by light, electron and immunofluorescence microscopy. Stem-cells engrafted in portal, sinusoidal and hepatic vein compartments, with cell alignment reminiscent of endothelium. Cell-surface marker expression altered following engraftment, from haematopoietic to endothelial phenotype and engrafted cells expressed sinusoidal endothelial endocytic receptors (mannose, Fc, stabilin receptors). These results represent one step towards complete recellularisation of the liver vasculature and progress towards the objective of generating transplantable neo-organs.","Harper, Simon; Hoff, Mekhola; Skepper, Jeremy; Davies, Susan; Huguet, Emmanuel",Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/term.3117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32808475/,223

METHODS AND RESULTS We retrospectively evaluated right ventricular pressures and the ePAD measured in 30 invasively ventilated COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients between 1 October 2020 and 31 March 2021. We divided the patients into two groups, survivors and non-survivors based on their 60 day mortality. Primary outcome variables were the values of right ventricular pressures and the ePAD over time after insertion of the right ventricular probe. Right ventricular systolic pressure [RVSP, (IQR; 25th to 75th percentile)] was significantly lower on the first and the last measurement day in the survivors compared with the non-survivors [Day 1: 38 (27-45) vs. 46 (44-49), P = 0.036; last day: 36 (27-44) vs. 51 (40-57) mmHg, P = 0.006]. 16/22 survivors and 7/8 non-survivors received sildenafil orally, one survivor received additionally inhaled nitric oxide and one survivor and one non-survivor each inhaled iloprost. On the last measurement day, both right ventricular pressure amplitude [31 (26-37) vs. 38 (35-47) mmHg, P = 0.027] and ePAD [22 (16-26) vs. 31 (23-34) mmHg, P = 0.043] were significantly lower in the survivors compared with the non-survivors. Four patients in the survivor group developed excessive high RVSP in the course of their disease (peak: 57/61/78/105 mmHg). After sildenafil 20 mg every 8 h, additional inhaled nitric oxide (20 ppm) in one and additional inhaled iloprost 20 μg every 4 h in another patient RVSP consecutively decreased substantially in all four patients until the end of the measurement period (47/23/42/47 mmHg). CONCLUSIONS The RVSP and right ventricular pressure amplitude both were significantly lower in the survivors compared with those in the non-survivors with a significant decrease in RVSP over time in the survivors suggesting successful lowering by pulmonary vasodilators.

It manifests after the 20th week of pregnancy as new-onset hypertension and substantial proteinuria and is responsible for severe maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality. Identifying biomarkers that predict PE onset prior to its establishment would critically help treatment and attenuate outcome severity. MicroRNAs are ubiquitous gene expression modulators found in blood and tissues. Trophoblast cell surface antigen (Trop)-2 promotes cell growth and is involved in several cancers. We assessed the PE predictive ability of maternal miR-125b in the first trimester of pregnancy by measuring its plasma levels in women with normal pregnancies and with pregnancies complicated by PE on the 12th week of gestation. To gain insight into PE pathogenesis we investigated whether Trop-2 is targeted by miR-125b in placental tissue. Data analysis demonstrated a significant association between plasma miR-125b levels and PE, which together with maternal body mass index before pregnancy provided a predictive model with an area under the curve of 0.85 (95% confidence interval, 0.70-1.00). We also found that Trop-2 is a target of miR-125b in placental cells; its localization in the basal part of the syncytiotrophoblast plasma membrane suggests a role for it in the early onset of PE. Altogether, maternal miR-125b proved a promising early biomarker of PE, suggesting that it may be involved in placental development through its action on Trop-2 well before the clinical manifestations of PE.","Licini, Caterina; Avellini, Chiara; Picchiassi, Elena; Mensa, Emanuela; Fantone, Sonia; Ramini, Deborah; Tersigni, Chiara; Tossetta, Giovanni; Castellucci, Clara; Tarquini, Federica; Coata, Giuliana; Giardina, Irene; Ciavattini, Andrea; Scambia, Giovanni; Renzo, Gian Carlo DI; Simone, Nicoletta DI; Gesuita, Rosaria; Giannubilo, Stefano R; Olivieri, Fabiola; Marzioni, Daniela",Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trsl.2020.07.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726711/,223

METHODS This multisite, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between April 2006 and November 2010 at the Tuscaloosa and Birmingham Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in Alabama. US military veterans who met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 39) or mirtazapine (n = 39) titrated up to 45 mg/d for an 8-week double-blind period followed by an 8-week open-label phase of mirtazapine treatment. The primary outcome efficacy measure was the Structured Interview for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (SIP). Secondary measures included other measures of PTSD, depression, and sleep. Analyses of treatment groups involved mixed-model procedures using a random intercept to test the hypotheses that mirtazapine would be more effective than placebo in reducing symptoms of PTSD and depression and improving quality of sleep. RESULTS Seventy-eight participants were randomized with 61 completing the 8-week controlled phase and 48 completing the open-label phase. No significant differences were observed between groups on the primary outcome of SIP scores during the controlled phase (P = .418). In secondary outcomes, significant improvements per the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale were found for the mirtazapine group compared to the placebo group (P = .041). The 8-week open-label phase demonstrated significant symptom improvement in SIP total score (P = .0003) and in scores on the SIP re-experiencing (P = .0007), avoidance (P = .0309), and hyperarousal (P = .0014) subscales. There were no significant differences in the occurrence of adverse events between groups. CONCLUSIONS This study did not show efficacy of mirtazapine monotherapy in the treatment of PTSD.

The GLIMPSE360 Field.,2020-08-01,"This article considers health and human rights implications for people deprived of liberty during the COVID-19 crisis. The health risks of incarceration for individual and community health, particularly in overcrowded and underresourced prisons and detention centers, are well known, but with the COVID-19 pandemic have become a public health emergency.Physical distancing in prisons is hardly manageable, and protective means are poor or lacking. Emergency releases have been shown to be feasible in terms of public safety but lack sustainability in reducing the number of people living in detention, and, globally, only a small proportion of them have been released. Without controlling the infection inside prisons, global efforts to tackle the spread of the disease may fail. People living in detention are not only more vulnerable to infection with COVID-19 but they are also especially vulnerable to human rights violations induced by inappropriate restrictions under the pretext of infection control. Therefore, alternatives for detention should be promoted and the number of incarcerated people radically decreased.This article calls on policymakers and all professionals involved in public health and criminal justice not to waste the opportunities provided by the crisis but to act now.

This study explored potential advantages of sequential learning of psychomotor and visuospatial skills for laparoscopic suturing and knot tying compared to simultaneous learning. METHODS Laparoscopy-naïve medical students were randomized into a sequential learning group (SEQ) or a simultaneous learning group (SIM). SEQ (n = 28) trained on a shoebox with direct 3D view before proceeding on a box trainer with 2D laparoscopic view. SIM (n = 25) trained solely on a box trainer with 2D laparoscopic view. Training time and number of attempts needed were recorded until a clearly defined proficiency level was reached. RESULTS Groups were not different in total training time (SEQ 5868.7 ± 2857.2 s; SIM 5647.1 ± 2244.8 s; p = 0.754) and number of attempts to achieve proficiency in their training (SEQ 44.0 ± 17.7; SIM 36.8 ± 15.6; p = 0.123). SEQ needed less training time on the box trainer with 2D laparoscopic view than did SIM (SEQ 4170.9 ± 2350.8 s; SIM 5647.1 ± 2244.8 s; p = 0.024), while the number of attempts here was not different (SEQ 29.9 ± 14.1; SIM 36.8 ± 15.6; p = 0.097). SEQ was faster in the first attempts on the shoebox (281.9 ± 113.1 s) and box trainer (270.4 ± 133.1 s) compared to the first attempt of SIM on the box trainer (579.4 ± 323.8 s) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION In the present study, SEQ was faster than SIM at the beginning of the learning curve. SEQ did not reduce the total training time needed to reach an ambitious proficiency level. However, SEQ needed less training on the box trainer; thus, laparoscopic experience can be gained to a certain extent with a simple shoebox.","Nickel, Felix; Hendrie, Jonathan D; Kowalewski, Karl-Friedrich; Bruckner, Thomas; Garrow, Carly R; Mantel, Maisha; Kenngott, Hannes G; Romero, Philipp; Fischer, Lars; Müller-Stich, Beat P",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-016-1421-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27055853/,223

The search identified 4,005 publications, of which 14 were ultimately included in the study. Most studies (12/14) measured the consumption over the previous 15 days, finding a consumption prevalence of 49.1% (95% CI: 48.5-49.6%, I2 = 100%). The recall period explains part of the heterogeneity found (R2 = 23%, p = 0.048), however the subgroup analysis did not allow for more homogeneous results. The use of medications occurs among almost half of all Brazilian adults. Appropriate pharmaceutical assistance and care are necessary to ensure the rational use of these technologies.","Gomes, Vanessa Pereira; Silva, Marcus Tolentino; Galvão, Taís Freire",Ciencia & saude coletiva,https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232017228.29412016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28793077/,223

It is important that local strategies be developed to enhance KMC usage. This study aimed to assess the effect of implementing an education protocol on the usage of KMC in the NICU and at home after discharge. METHODS Preterm mother-infant dyads admitted to the NICU were enrolled prospectively. In initial 3 mo, baseline data on KMC usage in the unit and at home after discharge was collected. In the next three months, a KMC education protocol consisting of one-to-one counseling, education and sensitization of the mother and family members regarding benefits and procedure of KMC and focussed group discussions was implemented such that it became a unit work protocol. In the next 3 mo, data on KMC usage in the unit and at home after discharge was again collected and compared with the baseline data. RESULTS Implementation of the education protocol resulted in earlier initiation of KMC (2.49 ± 0.67 vs. 4.65 ± 0.99 d, p < 0.05); increased duration of KMC (8 h/d vs. 3 h/d, p < 0.05); a higher proportion of eligible preterms receiving KMC during hospital stay (100% vs. 75%, p < 0.05) and at home (87% vs. 28%, p < 0.05) and KMC being provided more often by other family members (27.1% vs. 5.7%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Implementation of a KMC education protocol resulted in improved KMC usage in the unit and at home 4 wk after discharge.","Kapoor, Rohit; Verma, Anjali; Dalal, Poonam; Gathwala, Geeta; Dalal, Jagjit",Indian journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12098-020-03537-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079339/,223

MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE First, a laparoscopic approach is made using a conventional 5-trocar pneumoperitoneum technique. When the Retzius and paravesical spaces are dissected to expose the tendinous arch of the levator ani muscle, the transperineal approach is synchronously begun. After the levator ani muscle and bilateral puboprostatic ligaments are dissected, the DVC and urethra are completely exposed. A linear stapler is inserted through the transperineal port along the dorsal side of the pubic body. The DVC and urethra are carefully compressed and transected with minimal bleeding. We describe four cases of laparoscopic total pelvic exenteration using this technique. Tumor size, operation time, and estimated blood loss ranged from 30-130 mm, 535-877 minutes, and 50-1520 mL, respectively. DISCUSSION Transperineal dissection of the DVC and urethra by linear staplers decreases both operation time and blood loss.","Mukai, Toshiki; Nagasaki, Toshiya; Akiyoshi, Takashi; Yamaguchi, Tomohiro; Hiyoshi, Yukiharu; Nagayama, Satoshi; Fukunaga, Yosuke",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12932; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33721914/,223

Abdominal hernia is a disease that often requires the implantation of a mesh within the abdominal wall. To minimize pain and postsurgical complications, gluing the mesh appears to be a convenient method. For this purpose, a bioadhesive system based on solutions of chitosan and modified starch (oxidized maltodextrin) has been developed. Mixtures of these polysaccharides form either viscoelastic solutions or hydrogels, depending on various experimental parameters (chitosan concentration, starch degree of oxidation, molar ratio between amine and aldehyde functions, pH, etc.). An adhesion test was developed to assess the adherence of such systems under conditions similar to the intended use. The rheological behavior of each formulation was correlated to its adherence, and it was found that optimum adhesion is obtained for systems exhibiting an intermediate behavior between the viscoelastic solution and the gel.","Serrero, Aurélie; Trombotto, Stéphane; Bayon, Yves; Gravagna, Philippe; Montanari, Suzelei; David, Laurent",Biomacromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1021/bm101505r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21410142/,223
160997,The long road.,2021-02-19,"BACKGROUND For Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) infection, clinical laboratories provide essential contributions in the diagnosis of infection, stage prognostication, and evaluation of disease severity. We aimed to show laboratory problems including changes of test numbers, changes of test panels, and differences of preanalytical errors during Covid-19 pandemic and, in the current study, we also intended to give solutions for the obstacles to guide other possible pandemics. METHODS Our study was based on data between January 10, 2020, and May 10, 2020. The first Covid-19 case of the Republic of Turkey was seen March 10, 2020, which was determined as the threshold date for comparisons. This was a single center, data mining, retrospective study. RESULTS The number of patients admitted to hospital were 34,260 and 15,573, the number of total tests were 66,263 and 42,066 before and after pandemic, respectively, for the two-month interval. Test percentage changes were increased for D-dimer 136%, fibrinogen 3,113%, troponin 6%, and LDH 17%. Test percentage changes were decreased for CBC 37%, sedimentation 45%, aPTT 30%, PT 37%, CRP 28%, ProCT 10%, ferritin 29%, CK-MB 27%, blood gases 47%, ALT 43%, AST 42%, urea 42%, creatinine 42%, triglycerides 45%, sodium 42%, potassium 41%, chloride 21%, urine culture 58%, and blood culture 44%. When preanalytical sources of errors were investigated no differences were found. CONCLUSIONS Laboratories must take quick action and be prepared for changes in patient services during pandemics. The most reliable ways for this are past experiences, statistical analysis, co-operation with administrations, high quality communication skills, and a risk-based management system.","Ongen-Ipek, Belkiz; Sitar, Mustafa E; Karadeniz, Asli",Clinical laboratory,https://doi.org/10.7754/clin.lab.2020.200624; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33180431/,223

LITERATURE SURVEY Medline (PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews, Cochrane Central, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 1966 to March 1, 2019. METHODOLOGY Search was restricted to English language and adults (age ≥ 18 yr). Titles and abstracts were reviewed for relevance to study topics for inclusion. Case reports, reviews, non-SCI population studies, and studies examining fractures at the time of acute SCI were excluded. References of included articles from the original search and task force and external submissions yielded two additional articles that were included in the review after voting by task force members. Data extraction was performed by four task force members using a data extraction form, glossary, and instructions created in Microsoft Excel. Quality assessment was performed by three methodologists using prespecified criteria. SYNTHESIS Twenty-three articles were included. Use of surgery to treat LE fractures in chronic SCI has increased, though non-operative management was still more frequently reported. Regardless of type of management, amputations, nonunion/malunion, and pressure injuries (PIs) were among the most commonly reported complications. Functional and quality of life outcomes were less frequently reported. CONCLUSION There is insufficient evidence to support operative vs nonoperative management as best practice for management of LE fracture of SCI. Existing literature was limited by small sample sizes, lack of randomization or matched study designs, significant heterogeneity in populations and treatment strategies studied, and variability in defining and reporting outcomes of interest. The field would benefit from future research to address study design issues and standardization of outcome reporting to facilitate comparison of outcomes of operative vs nonoperative management.

While it is important to assess Second Amendment sanctuaries from a legal perspective, it is equally as important to understand them in the context of a broader protest movement against any efforts to strengthen gun laws. As the gun violence prevention movement has gained strength across the United States, particularly at the state level, gun rights enthusiasts have turned to Second Amendment sanctuaries in order to create a counter narrative to the increasing political power of gun safety. By passing these ordinances or resolutions, local officials legitimize and fuel Second Amendment absolutism which poses real risks to public safety and democracy.","Turret, Erica; Parsons, Chelsea; Skaggs, Adam","The Journal of law, medicine & ethics : a journal of the American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics",https://doi.org/10.1177/1073110520979408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33404316/,223

Recent metagenomic studies have identified nido-like virus sequences, particularly those related to the Coronaviridae, in a range of aquatic hosts including fish, amphibians and reptiles. We sought to identify additional members of the Coronaviridae in both bony and jawless fish through a combination of total RNA sequencing (meta-transcriptomics) and data mining of published RNA sequencing data, and from this reveal more of the long-term patterns and processes of coronavirus evolution. Accordingly, we identified a number of divergent viruses that fell within the Letovirinae subfamily of the Coronaviridae, including those in a jawless fish – the pouched lamprey. By mining fish transcriptome data we identified additional virus transcripts matching these viruses in bony fish from both marine and freshwater environments. These new viruses retained sequence conservation in the RNA-dependant RNA polymerase across the Coronaviridae, but formed a distinct and diverse phylogenetic group. Although there are broad-scale topological similarities between the phylogenies of the major groups of coronaviruses and their vertebrate hosts, the evolutionary relationships of viruses within the Letovirinae does not mirror that of their hosts. For example, the coronavirus found in the pouched lamprey fell within the phylogenetic diversity of bony fish letoviruses, indicative of past host switching events. Hence, despite possessing a phylogenetic history that likely spans the entire history of the vertebrates, coronavirus evolution has been characterised by relatively frequent cross-species transmission, particularly in hosts that reside in aquatic habitats.","Miller, Allison K.; Mifsud, Jonathon C.O.; Costa, Vincenzo A.; Grimwood, Rebecca M.; Kitson, Jane; Baker, Cindy; Brosnahan, Cara L.; Pande, Anjali; Holmes, Edward C.; Gemmell, Neil J.; Geoghegan, Jemma L.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.22.436364,223

It remains unclear to what extent IHE-associated outbreaks have contributed to transmission in nearby communities. We implemented high-density prospective genomic surveillance to investigate these dynamics at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor and the surrounding community during the Fall 2020 semester (August 16th through November 24th). We sequenced complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 1659 individuals, including 468 students, representing 20% of cases in students and 25% of total confirmed cases in Washtenaw County over the study interval. Phylogenetic analysis identified over 200 introductions into the student population, most of which were not related to other student cases. There were two prolonged transmission clusters among students that spanned across multiple on-campus residences. However, there were very few genetic descendants of student clusters among non-students during a subsequent November wave of infections in the community. We conclude that outbreaks at the University of Michigan did not significantly contribute to the rise in Washtenaw County COVID-19 incidence during November 2020. These results provide valuable insights into the distinct transmission dynamics of SARS- CoV-2 among IHE populations and surrounding communities.","Valesano, A. L.; Fitzsimmons, W. J.; Blair, C.

Our objective was to identify provinces with disproportionate prevalence of VOC relative to COVID-19 mitigation efforts in provinces and territories in Canada. Methods: We analyzed publicly available provincial- and territorial-level data on the prevalence of VOCs in relation to mitigating factors (summarized in three measures: 1. strength of public health countermeasures: stringency index, 2. how much people moved about outside their homes: mobility index, and 3. vaccine intervention: proportion of Canadian population fully vaccinated). Using spatial agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis (unsupervised machine learning), the provinces and territories were grouped into clusters by stringency index, mobility index and full vaccine coverage. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine the differences in the prevalence of VOC (Alpha, or B.1.1.7, Beta, or B.1.351, Gamma, or P.1, and Delta, or B.1.617.2 variants) between the clusters. Results: Three clusters of vaccine uptake and countermeasures were identified. Cluster 1 consisted of the three Canadian territories, and characterized by higher degree of vaccine deployment and lesser degree of countermeasures. Cluster 2 (located in Central Canada and Atlantic region) was typified by lesser implementation of vaccine deployment and moderate countermeasures. The third cluster was formed by provinces inthe Pacific region, Central Canada, and Prairie region, with moderate vaccine deployment but stronger countermeasures. The overall and variant-specific prevalence were significantly different across the clusters. Interpretation: This study found that implementation of COVID-19 public health measures varied across the provinces and territories. Considering the high prevalence of VOCs in Canada, completing the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine in a timely manner is crucial.","Adeyinka, D.

Disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite were used, yet no scientific evidence is available on its effectiveness to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 on the human body through spraying, although this chemical is effective in the elimination of the virus on inanimate surfaces. Since safety issues are of importance, countries have halted the operation of these tunnels. Available literature has suggested several effective disinfectants against SARSCoV-2, including iodine-based solution, such as povidone-iodine (PVP-I). This report describes the evaluation of the bactericidal activity of PVP-I in comparison to sodium hypochlorite, both in vitro and following spraying under a model tunnel. Two bacteria strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600) were used as model microorganisms. The spraying pattern and droplets distribution from the tunnel are also being described and were correlated with the effectiveness of the disinfectant droplets to eliminate the model bacteria. Results showed that 0.5 % v/v PVP-I and 0.5% v/v sodium hypochlorite are bactericidal (>5 log10 reduction) in vitro. However, sprayed disinfectants did not show similar activity. Bacterial growth was seen in all cloth samples for 0.5% v/v PVP-I and all cloth samples except right shoulder for 0.5 % v/v sodium hypochlorite. Hence, the design of any disinfectant tunnel is important, and with an effective disinfectant to justify its efficacy. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

We aim to present a guidance document on the diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting with CVT after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection. We reviewed the available evidence which consists on case reports, small case series, expert opinion and analogy with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) management. Because of the low level of evidence, this is an interim document, based only on expert opinion consensus. In patients presenting with CVT after being vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 infection, if there is thrombocytopenia a reliable HIT PF4 Antibody ELISA test should be performed, to confirm vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). In patients with CVT and thrombocytopenia, in whom VITT is suspected or confirmed, heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight) should be avoided and non-heparin anticoagulants are preferred. If possible, platelet transfusions should be avoided. If the diagnosis of VITT is confirmed or suspected, early intravenous immunoglobulins are indicated. This expert opinion is supported by low quality evidence. It should be periodically updated, or changed to a formal guideline, as new and higher quality evidence is eventually produced. Because of their potential unfavourable clinical course, patients developing symptoms and signs suggestive of CVT after being vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 virus should undergo urgent clinical and neuroimaging evaluation. In cases of suspected or confirmed VITT, non-heparin anticoagulants should be used, platelet transfusions avoided and intravenous immunoglobulin started early.","Ferro, José M.; Sousa, Diana Aguiar de Coutinho Jonathan M.; Martinelli, Ida",European Stroke Journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/23969873211030842,223

By September 2020, little guidance had been provided to school districts to inform fall teaching. This indecision led to a variety of teaching postures within a given state. In this report we examine Ohio school districts in-depth, to address whether on-premises teaching impacted COVID-19 disease outcomes in that community. We observed that counties with on-premises teaching had more cumulative deaths at the end of fall semester than counties with predominantly online teaching. To provide a measure of disease progression, we developed an observational disease model and examined multiple possible confounders, such as population size, mobility, and demographics. Examination of micropolitan counties revealed that the progression of COVID-19 disease was faster during the fall semester in counties with predominantly on-premises teaching. The relationship between increased disease prevalence in counties with on-premises teaching was not related to deaths at the start of the fall semester, population size, or the mobility within that county. This research addresses the critical question whether on-premises schooling can impact the spread of epidemic and pandemic viruses and will help inform future public policy decisions on school openings.","Ehman, C.; Luo, Y.; Yang, Z.; Zhu, Z.; Donovan, S.; Avery, A.

This present investigation examines whether the association between media use and mental health distress is more pronounced for Asian Americans for whom media messages that document and promote anti-Asian racism are likely to be especially salient and influential. Using a national survey of Asian (n = 524) and White (n = 527) American participants, our findings reveal that racial/ethnic identity interacted with the negative effect of media use on mental health for Asian Americans, but not for White Americans. We also explored whether the effect of media use on mental health was mediated by social and health risk perceptions. Results revealed that even though imagined stigma was associated with mental health distress, it did not mediate the effect of media use on mental health. Health risk perceptions mediated the negative effect of media use on both psychosocial distress and loneliness. Implications for health communication, media studies, and anti-Asian racism are discussed, especially in the context of health crises.","Johnson, J. M.

Personal Information Form, Housewives Burnout Scale (CUBAC) and UCLA Loneliness Scale (U-LS) were used to collect data. The average age of housewives was 38.75 ± 9.98, the mean score ECUBAC was 60.14 ± 17.97 and the mean score U-LS was 44.84 ± 8.78. The results show that relations with husband and children, education levels, time of marriage, the number of children and responsibility level of house-works affect the level burn-out and loneliness levels of housewives (p <0.05). During the quarantine process caused by the epidemic, the intensity of housework has increased, as all family members were at home and the care and nutritional needs of the individuals changed due to the epidemic. However, despite this increase, the fact that only housewives were responsible for housework, just like before the quarantine, caused them to feel high levels of burnout and loneliness. © 2021 The Author(s).

Therefore, a faster and efficient diagnostic method for population screening is desirable to flatten the curve of daily raise of cases. This will also help medical professional to treat the epidemic efficiently. The COVID 19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus poses a huge challenge to human being and the countries with high-density population are facing unique challenges. For the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, Quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) emerging as a gold standard for the identification of infection;however, infrastructure requirement for this assay is at a high-demand and therefore, resources are not abundant. We, therefore, propose a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based sensitive method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

166889,AREAdata: a worldwide climate dataset averaged across spatial units at different scales through time,2021-10-06,"Background: Falls are a major issue among older patients with cancer and can lead to interruption in cancer treatment. Ample evidence shows resistance and balance training can prevent falls in older adults;however, there is a paucity of evidence regarding exercise on fall prevention in the older cancer population, who often have unique risk factors for falls. Given the new reality of the COVID-19 pandemic, minimizing group gatherings and its associated risks is imperative for older patients, who are a vulnerable population. This study sought to investigate the feasibility of an 8-week, virtual exercise program and its preliminary effects on lower body strength and balance in community-dwelling cancer patients. Methods: Study participants were recruited for this pretest-posttest intervention study using consecutive sampling over a one-year period from the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton, Alberta. The intervention entailed leg muscle strengthening and balance training exercises that progressed in difficulty as outlined by the Otago program, and involved a virtual component (facilitated live by a certified exercise physiologist via Zoom meeting platform once a week) and independent at-home training component (twice a week). Lower body strength and balance were assessed using the 5-times chair-stand and the 4- stage balance test, respectively, and were analyzed using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Results: Twenty-seven older patients (mean age 70.1, range 65-76) participated. The most common cancer sites were breast (48%) and prostate (41%). One participant withdrew due to personal reasons unrelated to the program. The remaining 26 participants completed the intervention. Attendance rate for the virtual component was 97.6% and independent component 84.7%. Participants perceived the program as rewarding and enjoyable (100%), felt this program prepared them to exercise on their own (92%), were confident to continue exercising on their own (81%), and would recommend the program to other patients (100%). At baseline, 33% (n = 9) ≥1 fall over the past 6 months. A statistically significant improvement in lower body strength was detected post-intervention (p =.001), whereas no difference was detected in balance (p =.059). Conclusions: This virtual, hybrid resistance and balance training program was feasible, overwhelmingly accepted by our older participants, and appeared effective in improving lower body strength. Findings from this study may have potential to inform design of a larger, randomized multi-site study.","Sattar, S.; Effa, C.; Nedeljak, J.; Haase, K. R.; Alibhai, S. M.

Arboviruses are viruses transmitted through the bites of infected arthropods, predominantly mosquitoes or ticks. The first site of arbovirus inoculation is the biting site in the host skin, which is colonized by a complex microbial community that could possibly influence arbovirus infection. We demonstrated that pre-incubation of arboviruses with certain components of the bacterial cell wall, including lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of some Gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids or peptidoglycan of certain Gram-positive bacteria, significantly reduced arbovirus infectivity in vitro. This inhibitory effect was observed for arboviruses of different virus families, including chikungunya virus of the Alphavirus genus and Zika virus of the Flavivirus genus, showing that this is a broad phenomenon. A modest inhibitory effect was observed following incubation with a panel of heat-inactivated bacteria, including bacteria residing on the skin. No viral inhibition was observed after pre-incubation of cells with LPS. Furthermore, a virucidal effect of LPS on viral particles was noticed by electron microscopy. Therefore, the main inhibitory mechanism seems to be due to a direct effect on the virus particles. Together, these results suggest that bacteria are able to decrease the infectivity of alphaviruses and flaviviruses.","Langendries, Lana; Jacobs, Sofie; Abdelnabi, Rana; Verwimp, Sam; Kaptein, Suzanne; Baatsen, Pieter; Van Mellaert, Lieve; Delang, Leen",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.07.443110,223
167396,Editor's Note,2021,"Objectives: Respiratory illnesses like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and the current SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic are transmitted by respiratory droplets. Certain dental procedures generate aerosols, one of the highest sources of transmission of droplet infections. During the current pandemic, dentists in the UK were initially restricted in their work and now have guidance from NHS England and the Chief Dental Officer for the full resumption of safe and effective routine dental care to patients. Lack of work, impact on income and working in the continual pandemic situation are likely to cause significant mental stress in dentists. Occupational health (OH) can have a vital role to help such dentists remain in work by advising strategies to cope with stress and offering timely evidence-based interventions and adjustments. The aim was to assess if the dentists in the UK had access to OH and whether access to the OH services helped. Methods: A survey link was sent to 200 dentists in the UK after the peak of the current pandemic. Results: 124 dentists responded to the survey. The response rate was 62%. 59% of the dentists in the survey did not have access to OH services in their workplace. Only 15% of dentists working in the independent sector had access to OH services compared to 78% working in the NHS or having NHS contracts. None of the dentists in the survey accessed OH services. Conclusions: Access to OH services for the dentists needs improvement, particularly in the Independent sector in the UK.","Ranka, S.; Ranka, M.

A real-time location system (RTLS) with embedded inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors is used for measuring PA and SD. The position of each person is tracked to assess their SD, finding that the RTLS/IMU can measure the time in which interpersonal distance is not kept with a maximum uncertainty of 1.54 minutes, which compared to the 15-minute limit suggested to reduce risk of transmission at less than 1.5 m, proves the feasibility of the measurement. The data collected by the accelerometers of the IMU sensors are filtered using discrete wavelet transform and used to measure the PA in ageing people with an uncertainty-based thresholding method. PA and SD time measurements were demonstrated exploiting the experimental test in a pilot case with real users.","Casaccia, Sara Naccarelli Riccardo Moccia Sara Migliorelli Lucia Frontoni Emanuele Marco Revel Gian",Measurement,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2021.109946,223
167666,Does a Crisis Change News Habits? A Comparative Study of the Effects of COVID-19 on News Media Use in 17 European Countries,2021,"Feature-based attention is the ability to selectively attend to a particular feature (e.g., attend to red but not green items while looking for the ketchup bottle in your refrigerator), and steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) measured from the human electroencephalogram (EEG) signal have been used to track the neural deployment of feature-based attention. Although many published studies suggest that we can use trial-by-trial cues to enhance relevant feature information (i.e., greater SSVEP response to the cued color), there is ongoing debate about whether participants may likewise use trial-by-trial cues to voluntarily ignore a particular feature. Here, we report the results of a pre-registered study in which participants either were cued to attend or to ignore a color. Counter to prior work, we found no attention-related modulation of the SSVEP response in either cue condition. However, positive control analyses revealed that participants paid some degree of attention to the cued color (i.e., we observed a greater P300 component to targets in the attended versus the unattended color). In light of these unexpected null results, we conducted a focused review of methodological considerations for studies of feature-based attention using SSVEPs. In the review, we quantify potentially important stimulus parameters that have been used in the past (e.g., stimulation frequency; trial counts) and we discuss the potential importance of these and other task factors (e.g., feature-based priming) for SSVEP studies.","Adam, Kirsten C.S.; Chang, Lillian; Rangan, Nicole; Serences, John T.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.31.275602,223

In Vietnam, universities have used online learning to help learners keep learning in this pandemic context. However, students and teaching staff have expressed concerns about the quality of the learning process. Inthis context, our research is looking for solutions to apply new technology in the teaching process to ensure the quality and effectiveness of learning. Among these new technologies, we consider digital games because most students play digital games and their positive effects on teaching, as evidenced by recent publications. Under the approach of technological process, our team evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of the digital game-based instructional technology at HUST. In terms of feasibility, research shows that most students agree that digital games can contribute to learning skills. In terms of effectiveness, there are three key findings. First, although male students play video games more than female students, the results show that both men and women have the same rate of digital games' effectiveness in learning. Second, there is no difference in assessing the effectiveness of digital games in learning between IT students and non-IT students although IT students are more exposed to technology. Third, there is a difference in the views of second-year students and third-year students.

168269,Appendix I Additional Notes on Taxonomy,2012-12-31,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments around the world to impose containment measures to prevent the rapid spread of the corona virus. The Indonesian government implemented “large-scale social restrictions,” which have impacted farming and farmers' food security. Farmers are both producers and consumers of food and, therefore, have been facing new challenges due to transport restrictions, price spikes for inputs, price drops for their produce, or conditions which aggravated cooperation, such as social distancing. This study aims at analysing the challenges of the containments from a smallholder farmer perspective and examining farmers' coping potential. A digital survey with 323 farmers has been designed as comparative observational research in Toraja, South Sulawesi, and selected regions of Java. The Bonferroni Multiple Comparison Test was used to test for significance regarding socioeconomic factors and space. A logistic regression model extracted determinants for crisis coping. Results reveal, that female farmers worry more about COVID-19 outbreak compared to men at a significant level. In contrast, male farmers, particularly in Java, are more concerned about social restrictions due to limited mobility. Food price spikes were reported in both regions, with sharp increases for fish, fruits, and vegetables in Java, for staples in Toraja, and for meat and sugar in both regions. Food groups, that trade through agents and brokers or are transported longer distances were affected most due to their complex and long supply chains that were disrupted during the restrictions. In Java, farmers face multiple shocks, of which climate change was reported even more often than the pandemic related shocks. Not being able to help each other on the farm due to social distancing is a significant concern of farmers in Toraja. As a result of food market disturbances, farmers began to grow and eat more vegetables and fruits. In conclusion, food security for farmers slightly decreased due to affordability, and market disruptions already point to long-term income losses. The study team recommends to promote smallholders' healthy food production, value addition and direct end-consumer linkages to build back better their livelihoods post-COVID-19. © 2021.

Design, Setting and Participants: Prospective case:cohort trial comparing clinical outcomes in patients aged 55 years or older who were PCR positive at a community testing site in Augusta, Georgia. Patients randomized to initiate one of two nasal irrigation regimens within 24 hours of testing were compared to outcomes in the CDC national database for the same time period. Interventions: Participants were assigned on alternate days to one of two pressure-based nasal irrigation systems (NAVAGE, Rhinosystems Inc.) or Neilmed Sinus Rinse (Neilmed Inc.), and randomized to include 2.5ml povidone-iodine or 0.5 teaspoon sodium bicarbonate to the standard saline rinse twice daily for 14 days with 14-day follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was hospitalization for COVID-19 symptoms within 28 days of enrollment by daily self-report confirmed with phone follow-up and hospital records compared to hospitalization rates publicly available from the CDC. Secondary outcomes in enrolled patients compared symptom resolution and home exposure, adherence to nasal irrigation, and any impact of irrigation system or antiviral or alkalization addition to the irrigant. Of 79 patients assigned to nasal irrigation (63.99[7.96] years, 36[45.6%] female, 43[54.4%]male), 0/37 assigned to povidone-iodine and 1/42 patients in the alkalinization group had a COVID-19 related hospitalization (1.26%). From September 22 to December 21, 2020, in patients 50+ years the CDC reported 1022977 cases with 197777 hospitalizations, or 19.33% (OR:0.054, 95%CI0.0074 to 0.38, p=0.0036). Full daily diaries were completed by 62 patients, averaging 1.79 irrigations/day. There were no statistical differences in symptomatic outcomes by irrigation unit used, but symptom resolution in 14 days was more likely in the povidone-iodine group (21/27) than the alkalinization group (17/35, p=0.019). Conclusion: Patients who initiated mechanical isotonic saline nasal debridement within 24 hours of a positive COVID-19 PCR test were 19 times less likely to be hospitalized than the national rate.

168488,The Evaluation of the News Related to Coronavirus in National Media before and after the First Declared Case in Turkey,2021,"Background: During 2021 several new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus appeared with both increased levels of transmissibility and virulence with respect to the original wild variant. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variation, first seen in India, dominates COVID-19 infections in several large countries including the United States and India. Most recently, the Lambda variant of interest with increased resistance to vaccines has spread through much of South America. Objective: This research explores the degree to which new variants of concern 1) generate spikes and waves of fluctuations in the daily case fatality rates (CFR) across countries in several regions in the face of increasing levels of vaccination of national populations and 2) may increase the vulnerability of persons with certain comorbidities. Methods: This study uses new, openly available, epidemiological statistics reported to the relevant national and international authorities for countries across the Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Daily CFRs and correlations of fatal COVID-19 infections with potential cofactors are computed for the first half of 2021 that has been dominated by the wide spread of several variants of concern as denoted by the World Health Organization. Results: The analysis yields a new quantitative measure of the temporal dynamics of mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infections in the form of variations of a proxy case fatality rate compared on a country to-country basis in the same region. It also finds minimal variation of correlation between the cofactors based on WHO data and on the average apparent case fatality rate.","Barletta, W.

168629,Enabling particle applications for exascale computing platforms,2021-09-19,"For decades, school attendance has an important role in determining student success and ensuring that students regularly come to classes. Traditionally, a sheet of paper and a pencil or pen is used to document school attendance at universities. In most cases, the professor would hand out a piece of paper to a student. This student would mark their presence on the paper sheet and pass it to the person sitting next to them. The piece of paper would then travel throughout the classroom until the final student received the paper. Finally, the piece of paper would be given back to the professor or the teacher's assistant, so they may take note of which student is present and which student is absent. In the age of the COVID-19 pandemic, this method of taking attendance poses a great risk to possible disease transmission. Everyone within the room would be touching the same piece of paper, and sometimes students may even share the same pen or pencil with their classmates. Everyone in the classroom, including the professor, would be at risk if one student were infected with the COVID-19 virus. This is attributed to the attendance method. This paper proposes a zero-effort, zerointeraction attendance method based on two aspects that are currently present in a typical classroom: access points and a student's Wi-Fi enabled devices (e.g., smartphones). Our research found this method to be a no-hassle attendance-taking method that pinpoints where a student is within the classroom, without the class suffering from any disruption in learning.","Sawall, E.; Honnef, A.; Mohamed, M.; AlQahtani, A.

Here we report a neural network model that predicts protein stability based only on sequences of amino acids, and demonstrate its performance by evaluating the stability of almost 200,000 novel proteins. These include a wide range of sequence perturbations, providing a baseline for future work in the field. We also report a second neural network model that is able to generate novel stable proteins. Finally, we show that the predictive model can be used to substantially increase the stability of both expert-designed and model-generated proteins.","Singer, Jedediah M.; Novotney, Scott; Strickland, Devin; Haddox, Hugh K.; Leiby, Nicholas; Rocklin, Gabriel J.; Chow, Cameron M.; Roy, Anindya; Bera, Asim K.; Motta, Francis C.; Cao, Longxing; Strauch, Eva-Maria; Chidyausiku, Tamuka M.; Ford, Alex; Ho, Ethan; Mackenzie, Craig O.; Eramian, Hamed; DiMaio, Frank; Grigoryan, Gevorg; Vaughn, Matthew; Stewart, Lance J.; Baker, David; Klavins, Eric",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.12.435185,223

High transmission rates of the virus threaten to cause a wave of infections which have the potential to overwhelm hospitals, leaving infected individuals without treatment. The World Health Organization (WHO) endorses two primary preventative measures for reducing transmission rates: The usage of face masks and adherence to social distancing [World Health Organization 2021]. In order to increase population adherence to these measures, we designed the Health Greeter Kiosk: A form of digital signage. Traditional physical signage has been used throughout the pandemic to enforce COVID-19 mandates, but lack population engagement and can easily go unnoticed. We designed this kiosk with the intent to reinforce these COVID-19 prevention mandates while also considering the necessity of population engagement. Our kiosk encourages engagement by providing visual feedback which is based on analysis from our kiosk's computer vision software.

In 2012, a focused healthcare reform was initiated in Austria to strengthen the primary care sector. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the perceptions, desires and needs of patients in terms of primary care as a necessary building block of the Austrian healthcare reform. Methods: This study was designed as an exploratory qualitative study using semi-structured interviews between the years 2013 and 2018. Research questions focused on patients positive and negative experiences with regard to GP consultations and the overall primary care system, as well as desires for improvement. Qualitative content analysis by Mayring was used to analyze the material. Results: Altogether, 41 interviews were conducted with seven main-categories identified. These categories include coordination and time management around consultation, human and professional aspects of consultation including coordination of care, access and availability including opening hours, infrastructure and hygiene of the waiting room, personnel, and overarching healthcare system factors. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the importance of bringing the patients voice into ongoing healthcare reform. Without appreciating and responding to patients perceptions and needs, healthcare reform in Austria might be challenged to improve in areas such as time, coordination and navigation. Successful health care reform necessitates the inclusion of the patient voice.","Hoffmann, K.; Rumpler, N.; George, A.; Boeckxstaens, P.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.11.21256986v1?rss=1,223

This was meant to study the difference between each group’s growth of infected cases in addition to their mortality percentage rates (MPR). Modeling was done for each group with the use of MATLAB;for the growth rate, the exponential growth equation was considered, and for the mortality rate percentage, the equation was modeled over the span of the first chosen thirty days of the virus’s spread. An analysis was done with the consideration of Oxford’s Stringency Index Model (SIM) of government responses for each day in order to understand the effect of such taken regulations in the virus’s spread and fatality for different groups of population densities. Eventually, it was found that population density is not a significant factor in the virus’s infectiousness and mortality percentage rates;Instead, taking governmental responses of appropriate stringencies is found to be the key solution for control and protection. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ibrahim, A.

172385,"Engaged Science: Strategies, Opportunities and Benefits",2020,"OBJECTIVE Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) appears to be more common among women than men, though the underlying reasons for this remain unclear. In a community sample of young adults (n=996, aged 18-30) assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we investigated gendered patterns in NSSI etiology. METHODS Mediation and moderation analyses considered associations between past-year NSSI prevalence, gender, and putative mechanistic variables: self-reported psychological distress (K10), emotion dysregulation (DERS), and impulsivity (UPPS-P). RESULTS Nearly twice as many women as men reported past-year NSSI (14.47% versus 7.78%). Women reported significantly higher psychological distress and significantly lower sensation seeking and positive urgency than men. Psychological distress partially statistically mediated the relationship between gender and past-year NSSI. Gender did not significantly moderate associations between self-reported distress, emotion dysregulation, or impulsivity and past-year NSSI. Past-year NSSI prevalence did not significantly decrease with age and we found no significant age by gender interaction. CONCLUSIONS Greater levels of NSSI in young women are explained by their greater levels of emotional distress. Women do not appear to be more likely than men to report NSSI due to differences in how they manage emotional distress: gender did not moderate the association between psychological distress and past-year NSSI, and there were no gender differences in emotion dysregulation or negative urgency. Furthermore, we show that NSSI remains prevalent beyond adolescence. Early interventions which reduce distress or improve distress tolerance, strengthen emotion regulation skills, and provide alternative coping strategies merit investigation for NSSI.","Lutz, N.

Methods: Data of 137 COVID-19 inpatients treated in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from February 1 to February 29, 2020 were collected. Patients were divided into GI group and Non-GI group according to the presence of digestive system abnormalities and gastrointestinal symptoms before and during admission. General data, clinical data, and relevant laboratory examination results of 137 patients were collected. SPSS 23.0 software was used for statistical analysis to compare the differences of various indicators between the two groups. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the clinical data and the clinical manifestations of fever and dry cough between the GI group and the Non-GI group (P&gt;0.05). The proportion of patients with fatigue in the GI group was higher than that in the Non-GI group (P&lt;0.001). The proportion of critically ill patients was greater than that of the Non-GI group (P=0.011), and the proportion of GI combined with hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and chronic liver disease was higher than that of the Non-GI group (all P&lt;0.05). GI group mortality rate was much higher than that of Non-GI group (P&lt;0.001). Patients with GI group had higher white blood cell count and neutrophil count than Non-GI (P&lt;0.001). The proportion of neutrophils, lymphocytes as well as lymph between the two groups had no statistical difference (P&gt;0.05). The proportion of monocytes in the GI group was lower than that in the Non-GI group (P=0.033). There was no statistical difference in platelet count and C-reactive protein level between the two groups (P&gt;0.05). LDH, TBIL, and Urea levels of GI group were higher than those of Non-GI group (P&lt;0.05).

IFITM3 reduces membrane fusion between cells and virions through a poorly characterized mechanism. We identified a GxxxG motif in many CD225 proteins, including IFITM3 and proline rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2). Mutation of PRRT2, a regulator of neurotransmitter release, at glycine-305 was previously linked to paroxysmal neurological disorders in humans. Here, we show that glycine-305 and the homologous site in IFITM3, glycine-95, drive protein oligomerization from within a GxxxG motif. Mutation of glycine-95 in IFITM3 disrupted its oligomerization and reduced its antiviral activity against Influenza A and HIV-1. The oligomerization-defective variant was used to reveal that IFITM3 promotes membrane rigidity in a glycine-95-dependent manner. Furthermore, a compound which counteracts virus inhibition by IFITM3, amphotericin B, prevented the IFITM3-mediated rigidification of membranes. Overall, these data suggest that IFITM3 oligomers inhibit virus-cell fusion by promoting membrane rigidity.","Rahman, Kazi; Coomer, Charles A.; Majdoul, Saliha; Ding, Selena; Padilla-Parra, Sergi; Compton, Alex A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.14.096891,223

174095,Dynamic Language Models for Continuously Evolving Content,2021-06-11,"Background: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, routine screening mammography (SM) was stopped and diagnostic mammography (DM) was limited for several months across the United States in order to reduce patient exposure and redeploy medical personnel. We hypothesized that this delay would result in patients presenting with later-stage disease following the initial shutdown. Methods: Patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancers from 2016-2020 were identified using the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Cancer Registry. Baseline patient characteristics, demographics, and clinical information were gathered and cross-referenced with our electronic medical record. Late-stage disease was defined as initial anatomic stage III-IV disease in the AJCC 8th edition staging system. The control cohort consisted of patients diagnosed from 2016-2019;patients diagnosed in 2020 were the test cohort. Chi-squared analysis was used to compare monthly distributions in stage at diagnosis between the control and test cohorts. Multivariate analysis was performed using a logistic regression model. Results: There were 1597 patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2016-2019 and 333 in 2020. Median age at diagnosis was 60 years;99% were female, and 69.1% were white. Mammography was limited from 3/16/20-6/8/20, with 90% reduction in volume during this time. The number of screening studies performed in March, April, May, and June of 2020 were 987, 1, 4, and 721 compared to 2042, 2141, 2241, and 2142 in 2019. The volume of new diagnoses per month decreased substantially during the shutdown (see table). The proportion of patients diagnosed with late-stage disease was 6.6% in the control cohort compared to 12.6% in the 2020 test cohort (p &lt; 0.001);92.9% of late-stage diagnoses in 2020 occurred from June to December following the shutdown period. On multivariate analysis, year of diagnosis (2020 vs 2016-2019;OR = 4.25 95% CI 0.035-0.095, p &lt; 0.001), lower income (&lt;200% of the federal poverty level;OR = 2.73 95% CI 0.016-0.099, p = 0.006) and increased Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR = 12.01 95% CI 0.037-0.052, p &lt; 0.001) were associated with later stage at diagnosis. Conclusions: Patients were more likely to be diagnosed with late-stage breast cancer following the global shutdown due to the SARSCoV-2 pandemic. Patients with lower income and medical comorbidities were disproportionately affected. These data raise significant concerns regarding the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on cancer diagnoses and long-term outcomes, especially in vulnerable patient populations. (Table Presented).","Lloyd, M.

In some countries, health systems have been overwhelmed, since in most cases they were not prepared to assist the large number of people who were affected. In the absence of vaccines and treatments of proven efficacy, the most obvious measure is the lockdown. An initial lockdown of five months was one of the first measures taken by the Colombian government to impede the spread of the virus. However, this measure did not prevent the country from becoming the fifth in number of infected people worldwide. With a population of about 8 million people and the social dynamics and mobility typical of a capital city, Bogotá has high rates in the statistics of incidence, effective reproduction and mortality. It is assumed that after reaching herd immunity, the incidence of the virus diminishes. But the current priority in the country is to focus on the scarce resources on the sites and the communities most prone to contagion. This document presents the use of machine learning-based models to identify these potential nuclei. A clustering model was constructed using the Simple K-means algorithm to identify clusters of people who are most susceptible to contracting the virus. Four algorithms were used for determining the value of the effective reproduction number.

They all assumed that each user in the seed set we select is activated successfully and then spread the influence. However, in the real scenario, not all users in the seed set are willing to be an influencer. Based on that, we consider each user associated with a probability with which we can activate her as a seed, and we can attempt to activate her many times. In this paper, we study the adaptive influence maximization with multiple activations (Adaptive-IMMA) problem, where we select a node in each iteration, observe whether she accepts to be a seed, if yes, wait to observe the influence diffusion process; If no, we can attempt to activate her again with a higher cost or select another node as a seed. We model the multiple activations mathematically and define it on the domain of integer lattice. We propose a new concept, adaptive dr-submodularity, and show our Adaptive-IMMA is the problem that maximizing an adaptive monotone and dr-submodular function under the expected knapsack constraint. Adaptive dr-submodular maximization problem is never covered by any existing studies. Thus, we summarize its properties and study its approximability comprehensively, which is a non-trivial generalization of existing analysis about adaptive submodularity. Besides, to overcome the difficulty to estimate the expected influence spread, we combine our adaptive greedy policy with sampling techniques without losing the approximation ratio but reducing the time complexity. Finally, we conduct experiments on several real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed policies.","Guo, Jianxiong; Wu, Weili",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.08060v2.pdf,223

However, career guidance during the pandemic can serve as a tool for understanding the situation in depth and searching for new opportunities that exist, by helping individuals to overcome anxiety. While practicing physical distancing, career counselors have kept active professional networks in assisting their clients with their needs. The operation of career guidance has been transferred mainly to the online format and has required the counselors to develop new skills and competencies. The methodology employed in this study included interviews with individual career counselors about the main challenges and solutions discovered during the lockdown. Career counselors were questioned also about how they shaped a more sustainable and flexible online career guidance system. They revealed details about their struggles and hopes encountered in the situation of crises. The authors point to critical areas for improvement that career counselor can provide to their clients during the lockdown.","Šapale, Sandra Iliško Dzintra Badjanova Jelena",Discourse and Communication for Sustainable Education,https://doi.org/10.2478/dcse-2021-0010,223

In an online experiment of undergraduate students at a large university in the U.S. Mountain West (n = 78) in early May 2020, we found that trust in government agencies played an important role in how people interpret risk messages in media. When the risks are amplified, those who hold low levels of trust in government agencies are more likely to report higher levels of anxiety. When risks are downplayed, people who hold high levels of trust in government agencies are more likely to report greater risk perceptions than those who hold low levels of trust in government agencies.

175662,Educate Back Better: A Perspective from Industry,2021,"Instructional design is a major concern in TELE (Technology Enhanced Learning Environments) research, especially since the beginning of the Covid-19 health crisis. Since the beginning of this crisis, emergency remote teaching has been widely used. Accordingly, the primary objective in these circumstances is not to re-create a robust educational ecosystem, but rather to provide adapted access to instructional support, learning materials, services and objects. However, design connectedness in such environments is still required regarding the emergence of IoT (Internet of things) and CPS (Cyber Physical Systems) in everyday life and thus in educational environments. In this paper, we propose a model-driven engineering method for the design of Educational Cyber Physical Systems (ECPS). Our method deals with the separation of concerns when it comes to considering a Platform Independent Model (educational aspect) and a Platform Description Model (connected aspect). This practice could then be adopted in order to design further environments by adapting the required models. Copyright © 2021 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

However, this price reduction comes with a decrease in the availability guarantees. To our knowledge, there is no work that accurately captures the short-term trade-off between spot price and availability, and does long-term analysis for spot price tendencies in favor of user decision making. In this work, we propose a utility-based strategy, that balances cost and availability of spot instances and is targeted to short-term analysis;and a LSTM neural network framework for long term spot price tendency analysis. Our experiments show that, for r4.2xlarge, 90% of spot bid suggestions ensured at least 5.73 hours of availability, with a bid price of approximately 38% of the on-demand price. The LSTM experiments predicted spot price tendencies for several instance types with low error. Our LSTM framework predicted an average value of 0.19 USD/hour for the r5.2xlarge instance type, which is about 37% of the on-demand price. Finally, we used our combined mechanism on an application that compares thousands of SARS-CoV-2 sequences and show that our approach is able to provide good choices of instances, with low bids and very good availability.

Here, we sought to identify the potential molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 mediated coagulopathy and thromboembolism. A broader investigation was conducted including hospitalized COVID-19 patients with (severe cases that required intensive care) or without pneumonia (moderate cases). Phenotypic and molecular characterizations were performed employing basic coagulation tests, flow cytometry-based multiplex assays, and ELISA. The investigations revealed induction of plasma P-selectin and CD40 ligand (sCD40L) in moderate COVID-19 cases which were significantly abolished with the progression of COVID-19 severity. Moreover, a profound reduction in plasma tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and FXIII were identified particularly in the severe COVID-19. Further analysis revealed a profound induction of fibrinogen in both moderate and severe patients. Interestingly, an elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 more prominently in moderate, and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) particularly in severe COVID-19 cases were observed. Particularly, the levels of fibrinogen and tPA directly correlated with the severity of COVID-19. In summary, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the levels of platelet activation markers soluble P-selectin and sCD40L in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, an attenuated level of TFPI indicates TF pathway activation and, acquired FXIII deficiency likely plays a key role in thrombus instability and promotes thromboembolism in severe cases. The progression of COVID-19 severity could be limited with anti-platelet in combination with recombinantTFPI treatment. Furthermore, thromboembolic events in severe COVID-19 patients could be minimized if treated with recombinantFXIII in combination with LMW heparin.","Al-Tamimi, Abaher O.; Yusuf, Ayesha M.; Jayakumar, Manju N.; Ansari, Abdul W.; Elhassan, Mona; AbdulKarim, Fatema; Kannan, Meganathan; Halwani, Rabih; Ahmad, Firdos",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.23.457378,223

178434,Hands On,2021,"Tauopathies are a class of neurodegenerative diseases associated with pathological tau. Despite many advances in our understanding of these diseases, the direct mechanism through which tau contributes to neurodegeneration remains poorly understood. Previously, our lab implicated the histone demethylase LSD1 in tau-induced neurodegeneration by showing that LSD1 localizes to pathological tau aggregates in Alzheimer’s disease cases, and that it is continuously required for the survival of hippocampal and cortical neurons in mice. Here, we utilize the P301S tauopathy mouse model to demonstrate that pathological tau can exclude LSD1 from the nucleus in neurons. In addition, we show that reducing LSD1 in these mice is sufficient to highly exacerbate tau-mediated neurodegeneration and tau-induced gene expression changes. Finally, we find that overexpressing LSD1 in the hippocampus of tauopathy mice, even after pathology has formed, is sufficient to significantly delay neurodegeneration and counteract tau-induced expression changes. These results suggest that inhibiting LSD1 via sequestration contributes to tau-mediated neurodegeneration. Thus, LSD1 is a promising therapeutic target for tauopathies such as Alzheimer’s disease. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We have made the novel discovery that pathological tau functions through the histone demethylase LSD1 in the Alzheimer’s disease pathway. Thus, we have identified a mechanism that links tau to the downstream neuronal dysfunction pathways. This step can potentially be targeted therapeutically, after the onset of dementia symptoms, to block the progression of dementia in Alzheimer’s disease patients.","Engstrom, Amanda K.; Walker, Alicia C.; Moudgal, Rohitha A.; Myrick, Dexter A.; Kyle, Stephanie M.; Bai, Yu; Rowley, M Jordan; Katz, David J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/745133,223

This implies a diverse host immune response to SARS-CoV-2. However, the immunological underpinnings underlying these divergent disease courses remain elusive. We therefore set out to longitudinally characterize immune signatures of convalescent COVID-19 patients stratified according to their disease severity. Our unique convalescent COVID-19 cohort consists of 74 patients not confounded by comorbidities. This is the first study of which we are aware that excludes immune abrogations associated with non-SARS-CoV-2 related risk factors of disease severity. Patients were followed up and analyzed longitudinally (2, 4 and 6 weeks after infection) by high-dimensional flow cytometric profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), in-depth serum analytics, and transcriptomics. Immune phenotypes were correlated to disease severity. Convalescence was overall associated with uniform immune signatures, but distinct immune signatures for mildly versus severely affected patients were detectable within a 2-week time window after infection.","Chu, C.

179144,Research on Dry Microwave Heating Infectious Aerosols or Droplets on Respirators,2021,"Quick, early, and precise detection is important for diagnosis to control the spread of COVID-19 infection. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology could certainly be used as a modulating tool to ease the detection, and help with the preventive steps further. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many visual recognition tasks. Nevertheless, most of these state-of-the-art networks highly rely on the availability of a high amount of labeled data, being an essential step in supervised machine learning tasks. Conventionally, this manual, mundane, and time-consuming process of annotating images is done by humans. Learning to localize or detect COVID-19 infection masks in our specific case study typically requires the collection of CT scan data that has been labeled with bounding boxes or similar annotations, which generally is limited. A technique that could perform such learning with much less annotations, and transfer the learned proposals that are algorithm-driven to generate more synthetic annotated samples would be helpful And quite valuable. We present such a technique inspired by weakly trained mask region based convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) architecture for localization, in which the number of images with their pixel-level masks can be a small proportion of the total dataset, and then further improvise CNNs by inversely generating dense annotations on-the-go using an algorithmic-based computational approach. We focus on alleviating the bottleneck associated with deep learning models needing annotated data for training in an intuitive reverse engineering fashion through this work. Our proposed solution can certainly provide the prospect of automated labeling on-the-fly, thereby reducing much of the manual work. As a result, one can quickly train a precise COVID-19 infection detector with the leverage of autonomous frame-by-frame machine generated annotations. The model achieved mean precision accuracy (%) of 0.99, 0.931, and 0.8 for train, validation, and test set, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can be adopted in a clinical setting for assisting radiologists, and also our fully autonomous approach can be generalized to any detection/recognition tasks at ease.

179255,Is a Classification Procedure Good Enough? A Goodness-of-Fit Assessment Tool for Classification Learning,2019-11-08,"Background and aims TLR4 is an important innate immune receptor that recognizes bacterial LPS, viral proteins and other pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). It is expressed on tissue-resident and immune cells. We previously proposed a model whereby SARS-CoV-2 activation of TLR4 via its spike glycoprotein S1 domain increases ACE2 expression, viral loads and hyperinflammation with COVID-19 disease [1]. Here we test this hypothesis in vitro and demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 domain is a TLR4 agonist in rat and human cells and induces a pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage phenotype in human THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages. Methods Adult rat cardiac tissue resident macrophage-derived fibrocytes (rcTMFs) were treated with either bacterial LPS or recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoprotein. The expression of ACE2 and other inflammatory and fibrosis markers were assessed by immunoblotting. S1/TLR4 co-localisation/binding was assessed by immunocytochemistry and proximity ligation assays on rcTMFs and human HEK-293 HA-TLR4-expressing cells. THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into M1 or M2 macrophages with LPS/IFNγ, S1/IFNγ or IL-4 and RNA was extracted for RT-qPCR of M1/M2 markers and ACE2. Results TLR4 activation by spike S1 or LPS resulted in the upregulation of ACE2 in rcTMFs as shown by immunoblotting. Likewise, spike S1 caused TLR4-mediated induction of the inflammatory/wound healing marker COX-2 and concomitant downregulation of the fibrosis markers CTGF and Col3a1, similar to LPS. The specific TLR4 TIR domain signalling inhibitor CLI-095 (Resatorvid®), blocked the effects of spike S1 and LPS, confirming that spike S1 is a TLR4 agonist and viral PAMP (VAMP). ACE2 expression was also inhibited by the dynamin inhibitor Dynasore®, suggesting ACE2 expression is mediated by the alternative endosomal/β-interferon pathway. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed 1:1 stoichiometric spike S1 co-localisation with TLR4 in rat and human cells. Furthermore, proximity ligation assays confirmed spike S1 and TLR4 binding in human and rat cells. Spike S1/IFN-γ treatment of THP-1-derived macrophages induced pro-inflammatory M1 polarisation as shown by an increase in IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA. Conclusions These results confirm that TLR4 is activated by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain and therefore TLR4 may be a receptor/accessory factor for the virus. By binding to and activating TLR4, spike S1 caused upregulation of ACE2, which may facilitate viral entry into cells. In addition, pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage polarisation via TLR4 activation, links TLR4 activation by spike S1 to inflammation. The clinical trial testing of CLI-095 (Resatorvid®) and other TLR4 antagonists in severe COVID-19, to reduce both viral entry into cells and hyperinflammation, is warranted. Our findings likely represent an important development in COVID-19 pathophysiology and treatment, particularly regarding cardiac complications and the role of macrophages.","Aboudounya, Mohamed M.; Holt, Mark R.; Heads, Richard J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.11.455921,223

Objectives: Assess the impact of COVID-19 on patient management and prescribing strategy across the EU and US, as described by rheumatologists, dermatologists, and gastroenterologists. Methods: Data were drawn from physician surveys in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK and US between July and December 2020. Physicians completed an online or telephone survey assessing how COVID-19 has impacted type and frequency of consultations;choice and prescription of medication. Results: 847 physicians took part;355 rheumatologists, 200 dermatologists (Germany, Spain, UK, and US only), and 282 gastroenterologists. As a result of COVID-19, most physicians stated they have moved at least some patients to video or telephone consultations (70% rheumatologists;55% dermatologists;60% gastroenterologists) and reduced overall frequency of consultations with patients (59% rheumatologists;64% dermatologists;51% gastroenterologists) (Table 1). 35% of rheumatologists, 22% of dermatologists, and 14% of gastroenterologists described COVID-19 as changing the way they choose and prescribe medication, with differences observed between countries (Figure 1). Of those who stated they have made medication changes, rheumatologists stated changing medication to self-administration (62%) and not starting new patients on an advanced therapy (biologic DMARD or targeted synthetic DMARD) (58%) as most frequent. Dermatologists stated changes include changing treatment to more COVID-appropriate treatment (71%) and prescribing repeat prescriptions more regularly without consultation (56%). Gastroenterologists stated changes include changing medication to self-administration (55%) and prescribing a longer course of medication (48%). Comparing across countries, for all specialties, the greatest changes were observed in the UK followed by Spain, with least changes in Germany and Italy. Conclusion: There have been changes in the process of how healthcare is delivered, although treatment prescription was impacted to a lesser extent than consultation type and frequency. This varies across geographies, which may be due to differences in reported prevalence of COVID-19. Differences are also observed across specialities, which may be due to guidance received from specialty bodies. It is unknown what the long-term impact of changes in the management of patients due to COVID-19 will be on patient outcomes, satisfaction, engagement and adherence, and further research is needed.","Holdsworth, E.; Lukanova, R.; Hughes, M.; Hall, J.; Austin, J.; Taylor-Stokes, G.; Piercy, J.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.2103,223

Recently, some studies have reported that people with O blood type are protected against COVID- 19, while people with A blood type are more susceptible to contract this disease. Here, we analysed data from 5668 COVID-19 patients along with the same number of control samples in a study population in Iraq. Our analysis confirms that people with O blood type are protected partially against COVID-19. Notably, we demonstrate that people with RhD- are more susceptible to contract COVID-19 than people with RhD+ blood type. The blood types are associated with some clinical symptoms such as headache and asthenia of COVID-19, but there is no association with other symptoms. There is no association between blood types and deaths among COVID-19 patients. This study suggests that in addition to ABO, RhD blood type influences the susceptibility to contract COVID-19. Overall, we conclude that susceptibility/protection against COVID-19 may not be determined based only on blood types among the global population as this might vary based on a number of other factors such as ethnicity, geographical locations, occupation and the level of exposure to infected people.","Majeed, K.

180409,Delta variant triggers new phase in the pandemic,2021,"Background: Burnout is a syndrome defined by emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and loss of personal accomplishment. It is a growing concern amongst doctors, particularly in oncology, who face the added stress of delivering life changing results to patients and managing end of life care. This has potential for negatively impacting mental health, job satisfaction and ultimately patient care. This has been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty around complex oncological treatment decisions, longer working hours, redeployment, and constant changes to working patterns to meet the evolving clinical need. In response to this, a novel wellbeing intervention was designed by the educational lead consultant and psychologists to prevent burnout during the pandemic. Methods: Junior doctors working at a single UK cancer centre during the COVID-19 pandemic were invited to attend weekly 30 minute wellbeing sessions facilitated by a clinical psychologist throughout their oncology placement (average 4-6 months). Sessions had an average attendance of 3-6 doctors and began with a 5 minute breathing and relaxation exercise followed by a mixture of clinical debriefing, reflective practice, and mindfulness strategies. Trainees were invited to have individual sessions if required. Surveys based on the 14 point Warwick Edinburgh Well Being Scale (WEMWBS) were conducted at the start and end of placement. Additional qualitative feedback was collated. Results:Throughout a 6 month period, 10 doctors participated in this study. Baseline WEMWBS scores revealed average mental wellbeing (n = 8), high mental wellbeing (n = 1) and probable depression (n = 1). Median baseline WEMWBS score was 52(41-62). Median number of sessions attended was 11(3-14). Post intervention, there was no significant deterioration in baseline WEMWBS score (mean change +2.2;p= 0.34). When doctors were asked about their optimism for the future, there was a significant increase by +0.4 points (p= 0.037). With respect to participant feedback, 100% were either 'satisfied' (n = 1) or 'very satisfied' (n = 9) with the group facilitation and 100% found the group sessions either 'helpful' (n = 7) or 'very helpful' (n = 3). Trainee feedback described the benefits of reflecting in a structured and safe environment, breathing exercises, and learning mindfulness strategies. Conclusions: Burnout is a serious concern amongst junior oncologists and is rising as a result of COVID-19. We present a novel intervention that promoted psychological flexibility and importantly maintained mental wellbeing throughout the pandemic. Further studies are planned to develop evidence based interventions to tackle this important issue.","So, A. C. P.; Hunter, S.; Chan, K.; Rigg, A.

Over 80 million people worldwide have already been infected, including almost 2 million deaths. Even if most people do not get infected they are at risk of suffering from the psychological consequences of the epidemic. The occurrence of serious infectious diseases contributes to the increase of fear and anxiety in society, which was also confirmed in previous epidemics of SARS, MERS and the H1N1 flu. With the increasing number of cases, the high number of deaths, and the inefficiency of health systems around the world, people feel fear of infection, death and complications. In addition to health problems, the COVID-19 pandemic has also brought changes in many areas of social life: closure of schools and workplaces, economic problems, as well as isolation from loved ones and limitation of social contacts. The stress of being in quarantine and long-term isolation occurred. All of this increased the symptoms of stress, which has been shown in many studies conducted around the world. Studies show differences in the response to the epidemic depending on gender, age and occupation. Research has also shown that people’s emotions and behavior during a pandemic can affect its course. Therefore, in addition to fighting the medical aspect of COVID-19, it is also worth spending time and resources on analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on the psychological functioning of individuals and helping people who experience the worst psychological consequences of the epidemic.","Dymecka, Joanna",Neuropsychiatria i Neuropsychologia,https://doi.org/10.5114/nan.2021.108030,223

A network description of economic and social support measures in China and other countries was made, and the relative amounts of support as a percentage of the gross domestic product produced were disclosed. The structure of economic support measures is analyzed. It was found that the relative size of the economy's aid does not affect the growth of the real gross product. On the example of China, the effectiveness of administrative actions to localize the pandemic and support the economy is revealed, while the role of educating the appropriate civil initiative is noted. During a pandemic, the key factor in the subsequent recovery of the economy is not the amount of cash injections and benefits provided, but the discipline and responsibility of the authorities and society.","Zhao, D.; Velikorossov, V.; Maksimov, M.; Prodanova, N.; Chernenkaya, L.; Loshkov, B.",Laplage Em Revista,https://doi.org/10.24115/s2446-622020217extra-b916p.238-249,223

Children are used to them but they do not know how they are made. Engaging children in the design of smart things can help them learn of them and develop their own. Smart-thing design with children was usually held in person, in informal settings, with a learning by-doing and playful approach, and collaboratively, so as to sustain children’s learning over time. Recently the COVID pandemics has made this type of design with children impossible, e.g., due to physical distancing restrictions. Smart-thing design with children has thus adapted to the mutated settings and moved at a distance. What children can learn when designing at a distance, though, remains an open question. This paper tackles such issue. It reports on at-a-distance design workshops with 20 children, aged 8–16 years old. In this paper, data are processed in relation to children’s learning of smart-thing programming, before and after the workshops. Results indicate that design workshops, held at a distance, can help children learn how to program their own smart thing ideas. A significant positive correlation was also found between age and learning. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Roumelioti, E.; Pellegrino, M.

184461,MJA policy on sponsored supplements.,2008,"There is growing experimental evidence that many respiratory viruses--including influenza and SARS-CoV-2--can interact, such that their epidemiological dynamics may not be independent. To assess these interactions, standard statistical tests of independence suggest that the prevalence ratio--defined as the ratio of co-infection prevalence to the product of single-infection prevalences--should equal unity for non-interacting pathogens. As a result, earlier epidemiological studies aimed to estimate the prevalence ratio from co-detection prevalence data, under the assumption that deviations from unity implied interaction. To examine the validity of this assumption, we designed a simulation study that built on a broadly applicable epidemiological model of co-circulation of two respiratory viruses causing seasonal epidemics. By focusing on the pair influenza-SARS-CoV-2, we first demonstrate that the prevalence ratio systematically under-estimates the strength of interaction, and can even misclassify antagonistic or synergistic interactions that persist after clearance of infection. In a global sensitivity analysis, we further identify properties of viral infection--such as a high reproduction number or a short infectious period--that blur the interaction inferred from the prevalence ratio. Altogether, our results suggest that epidemiological studies based on co-detection prevalence data provide a poor guide to assess interactions among respiratory viruses.","Domenech de Celles, M.; Goult, E.; Casalegno, J.-S.; Kramer, S.

The present study examined vaccine uptake among primary-school teachers and sought to identify factors associated with it. A sample was recruited from 553 Polish primary schools, and data were collected at two time points: December 2020 and March 2021. Associations between vaccine uptake among teachers and their attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination were assessed through multivariate logistic regression. 6152 participants completed both baseline and follow-up surveys. Of these, 4502 (73.2%) reported their intention at baseline to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, if available; at follow-up, 3894 (86.5%) of the same 4502 reported having received the vaccination. A significant association was revealed between vaccine uptake and perceived severity, self-efficacy, and social norms. The principal driver for vaccine acceptance was the wish to avoid contracting the disease. Conversely, the principal driver for vaccine refusal was concern about side effects and safety. A strong association exists between intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and actual uptake. Future COVID-19 immunization programs may benefit from a stronger understanding of the factors associated with vaccine uptake among this cohort.","Malesza, M.; Sobolewska, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.11.21260317v1?rss=1,223

Design/methodology/approach: The reflection expresses the accounting lecturers’ observations and experiences of student engagement in online learning during the COVID-19 lockdown focussing on the three facets of student engagement;social presence, cognitive presence and teaching presence. Findings: The focus on social and teaching presence in online learning by Unitec academic staff had a positive impact on cognitive presence as student course success rates and course ratings were similar to rates achieved from face-to-face delivery despite a rapid transition to online learning. Research limitations/implications: This reflection is based on the experiences of three academic staff in one tertiary organisation. Practical implications: The findings of this study can be helpful for tertiary institutions that are planning to adopt blended learning in the future. Academic staff may revisit teaching pedagogies to design new strategies and institutions may develop blended learning guidelines and tools to support academics to embrace blended learning.

Various hypotheses of potential source of infection were investigated. Based on the collected information, the most likely route of transmission was through an infectious exotic Anopheles mosquito that arrived via the international airport of Brussels or the Military airport Melsbroek and infected the cases who lived at five kilometres from the airports. Based on a genomic analysis of the parasites collected from the two cases, the most likely origin of the Plasmodium was Gabon or Cameroon. Further, the parasites collected from the two Belgian patients were identical-by-descent, which supports the assumption that the two infections originated from the bite of the same mosquito, during an interrupted feeding. Despite these cases, airport malaria remains a rare event. Yet, it has significant implications, particularly for the patient, as delayed or missed diagnosis of the cause of illness often results in high rates of complications and mortality.

N-Glycolylneuraminic acid was recognized more efficiently by TGEV than was N-acetylneuraminic acid. For an efficient hemagglutination reaction the virions had to be treated with sialidase. This result suggests that the sialic acid binding site is blocked by virus-associated competitive inhibitors. Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), which is serologically related to TGEV but not enteropathogenic, was found to be unable to agglutinate erythrocytes. Incubation with sialidase did not induce a hemagglutinating activity of PRCV, indicating that the lack of this activity is an intrinsic property of the virus and not due to the presence of competitive inhibitors. Only monoclonal antibodies to an antigenic site that is absent from the S protein of PRCV were able to prevent TGEV from agglutinating erythrocytes. The epitope recognized by these antibodies is located within a stretch of 224 amino acids that is missing in the S protein of PRCV. Our results indicate that the sialic acid binding activity is also located in that portion of the S protein. The presence of a hemagglutinating activity in TGEV and its absence in PRCV open the possibility that the sialic acid binding activity contributes to the enterotropism of TGEV.","Schultze, B; Krempl, C; Ballesteros, M L; Shaw, L; Schauer, R; Enjuanes, L; Herrler, G",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8764078/,223

Anti-TCV hyperimmune turkey serum and normal turkey serum were used as positive or negative control serum for optimization of the ELISA system. Goat anti-turkey immunoglobulin G (light plus heavy chains) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was used as detector antibody. The performance of the ELISA system was evaluated with 45 normal turkey sera and 325 turkey sera from the field and the cutoff point was determined. Serum samples of turkeys experimentally infected with TCV collected sequentially from 1 to 63 days postinfection were applied to the established antibody-capture ELISA using IBV antigens. The optimum conditions for differentiation between anti-TCV hyperimmune serum and normal turkey serum were serum dilution at 1:40 and conjugate dilution at 1:1600. Of the 325 sera from the field, 175 were positive for TCV by immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) assay. The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA relative to IFA test were 93.1% and 96.7%, respectively, based on the results of serum samples from the field turkey flocks using the optimum cutoff point of 0.18 as determined by the logistic regression method. The ELISA values of all 45 normal turkey sera were completely separated from that of IFA-positive sera. The ELISA results of serum samples collected from turkeys experimentally infected with TCV were comparable to that of the IFA assay.

Lower health literacy and higher mortality rates in the homeless and vulnerable population compared with the background population potentially leaves this group or people more exposed to COVID-19. This study assessed the vulnerable population of Aarhus in relation to COVID-19 infection. METHODS Participants were tested during a six-day period in April and a four-day period in June at drop-in centres, injection rooms and homeless shelters in Aarhus. Oropharyngeal swab tests were performed and analysed with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Test days in June were supplemented with lateral flow tests for immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM. Prevalence and corresponding Wilson 95% confidence intervals were computed. RESULTS We tested 295 individuals in April and 141 individuals in June. All oropharyngeal swabs were COVID-19 negative. The lateral flow tests were IgM-positive in six of 129 individuals (4.7%) and IgG-positive less than five of 129 (less than 3.9%) individuals. On the day of testing, COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, coughing and/or sore throat were found in 63 of 240 (26.3%) of the participants in April and in 26 of 123 (21.1%) in June. In the April testing round, 175 of 291 (59.9%) reported to be born in Denmark. The corresponding number for the June testing round was 84 of 138 (60.9%). CONCLUSIONS Despite their vulnerable profile, the vulnerable citizens tested in Aarhus were not infected with COVID-19 at the testing day and very few participants carried antibodies.

Immunological and virological response in People Living with HIV (PLHIV) undertaking ART has to be monitored to assess the treatment response, diagnosing treatment failure and switching antiretroviral therapy. Objective To assess the immunological and virological response to antiretroviral therapy among Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected individuals. Method This is a cross-sectional study including people living with HIV (PLHIV) taking antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months and was conducted in Dhulikhel Hospital in 2017. The socio-demographic profile, clinical characteristics, CD4 count and viral load were analyzed. Descriptive analysis of socio-demographic and other characteristics was done. Result Fifty-two patients undertaking antiretroviral therapy were included in the study with the mean age of 29.69±9.59 years at diagnosis. The majority of the patients were male (51.9%). Sexual transmission was the dominant mode of transmission (78.9%). The mean CD4 count at baseline was 244.08±214.32 cells/µL. Four patients (7.7%) had a virological failure. There was a discordance between immunological and virological response in patients taking antiretroviral therapy for more than 2 years' duration with four patients with a recent CD4 count of ≤250 cells/µL had virological suppression. The mean CD4 count at treatment increased from 229.65 cells/µL to 453.33 cells/µL after 1 year of commencement of antiretroviral therapy (p<0.001). Conclusion There are optimal CD4 recovery and virological suppression as expected with antiretroviral therapy use.","Tamrakar, R; Tamrakar, D; Shrestha, S; Shrestha, A",Kathmandu University medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305751/,223
189849,The reactions of the oligodendrocyte.,1996,"We have developed a defective interfering (DI) RNA containing a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, placed behind an intergenic sequence, for studying subgenomic mRNA transcription of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a prototype coronavirus. Using this system, we have identified the sequence requirement for MHV subgenomic mRNA transcription. We show that this sequence requirement differs from that for RNA replication. In addition to the previously identified requirement for an intergenic (promoter) sequence, additional sequences from the 5' end of genomic RNA are required for subgenomic mRNA transcription. These upstream sequences include the leader RNA and a spacer sequence between the leader and intergenic sequence, which is derived from the 5' untranslated region and part of gene 1. The spacer sequence requirement is specific, since only the sequence derived from the 5' end of RNA genome, but not from other MHV genomic regions or heterologous sequences, could initiate subgenomic transcription from the intergenic sequence. These results strongly suggest that the wild-type viral subgenomic mRNAs (mRNA2 to mRNA7) and probably their counterpart subgenomic negative-sense RNAs cannot be utilized for mRNA amplification. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that a partial leader sequence present at the 5' end of genome, which lacks the leader-mRNA fusion sequence, could still support subgenomic mRNA transcription. In this case, the leader sequences of the subgenomic transcripts were derived exclusively from the wild-type helper virus, indicating that the MHV leader RNA initiates in trans subgenomic mRNA transcription. Thus, the leader sequence can enhance subgenomic transcription even when it cannot serve as a primer for mRNA synthesis. These results taken together suggest that the 5'-end leader sequence of MHV not only provides a trans-acting primer for mRNA initiation but also serves as a cis-acting element required for the transcription of subgenomic mRNAs. The identification of an upstream cis-acting element for MHV subgenomic mRNA synthesis defines a novel sequence requirement for regulating mRNA synthesis in RNA viruses.","Liao, C L; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8035475/,223
190306,Is Australia prepared for the next pandemic?,2017,"Replication of RNA viruses is regulated by cis-acting RNA elements, including promoters, replication silencers, and replication enhancers (REN). To dissect the function of an REN element involved in plus-strand RNA synthesis, we developed an in vitro trans-replication assay for tombusviruses, which are small plus-strand RNA viruses. In this assay, two RNA strands were tethered together via short complementary regions with the REN present in the nontemplate RNA, whereas the promoter was located in the template RNA. We found that the template activity of the tombusvirus replicase preparation was stimulated in trans by the REN, suggesting that the REN is a functional enhancer when located in the vicinity of the promoter. In addition, this study revealed that the REN has dual function during RNA synthesis. (i) It binds to the viral replicase. (ii) It interacts with the core plus-strand initiation promoter via a long-distance RNA-RNA interaction, which leads to stimulation of initiation of plus-strand RNA synthesis by the replicase in vitro. We also observed that this RNA-RNA interaction increased the in vivo accumulation and competitiveness of defective interfering RNA, a model template. We propose that REN is important for asymmetrical viral RNA replication that leads to more abundant plus-strand RNA progeny than the minus-strand intermediate, a hallmark of replication of plus-strand RNA viruses.","Panavas, Tadas; Nagy, Peter D",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16014939/,223

The cause was determined as a novel coronavirus (CoV), SARS-associated CoV (SARS-CoV), with a single-stranded, plus-sense RNA. To date, no effective specific treatment has been identified. To exploit the possibility of using RNA interference as a therapeutic approach to fight the disease, plasmid-mediated small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were generated to target the SARS-CoV genome. The expression of siRNAs from two plasmids, which specifically target the viral RNA polymerase, effectively blocked the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV on Vero cells. These two plasmids also inhibited viral replication as shown by titer assays and by an examination of viral RNA and protein levels. Thus, our results demonstrated the feasibility of developing siRNAs as effective anti-SARS drugs.","Wang, Zhi; Ren, Lili; Zhao, Xingang; Hung, Tao; Meng, Anming; Wang, Jianwei; Chen, Ye-Guang",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15220426/,223

Weanling gnotobiotic CD-1 mice inoculated intranasally with 10(3.0) mean tissue culture infective doses of SDAV remained asymptomatic. Virus was recovered from the nasopharynx, trachea, and lung from day 2 to day 7. Viral antigen was readily detected by indirect immunofluorescence in the lung but rarely in the nasopharynx. Infected mice developed interstitial pneumonia. Susceptible mice contact exposed to experimentally infected mice developed antibody to SDAV. Epizootiological studies indicated that retired breeder mice can have complement-fixing antibody to SDAV and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in the absence of MHV infection. These studies show that SDAV is infectious for mice and can be a pathogen for the respiratory system.

It seems that it affects mostly adults older than 40 years of age, and the death rate is highest for older individuals in the population. What should I tell parents worried about their children contracting the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19, and what symptoms should I look for to determine if there is a need to test for the virus?Answer The COVID-19 global pandemic affects all ages. Severe respiratory manifestations have been the mainstay of illness in adults, with what seems to be rapid deterioration necessitating mechanical ventilation. Only 5% of those tested and found to have COVID-19 have been younger than 19 years, possibly owing to limited testing, as the symptoms in children are usually mild. Symptoms in children include fever, dry cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and fatigue, and in 10% diarrhea or vomiting. Rarely dyspnea or hypoxemia were also described. Blood tests and imaging have been shown to be of little value in children and should only be ordered for those in whom you would normally order these investigations for viral-like illness. No specific therapy is available and supportive care with rest, fluids, and antipyretics for children is the recommended approach. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen for fever and pain can be given. Antiviral and immunomodulatory treatment is not recommended at this time for otherwise healthy children, and corticosteroids should also not be used. Children with immunocompromised states should be isolated and avoid contact with others.","Goldman, Ran D",Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404451/,223

It is an innovative teaching approach to realize students' self-transcendence by stimulating students' internal motivation for independent learning, applying group task-driven learning, and giving teachers' feedback to students' sharing. It consists of four steps: teachers' guiding, students' self-regulated learning, team learning and practice, experience sharing. We have applied this method to the teaching practice of physiology and experimental physiological science with a significant impact on teaching effects. This teaching method has also been implemented to other courses in other majors. To solve the problems of reduced communication and interaction, low learning enthusiasm and motivation in online teaching course during COVID-19 pandemic, we recruited 21 undergraduates from different schools and majors. Using the ""Tencent Meeting"" platform, the authors tried to apply the whole process of the ""Four-step Teaching of Encouraging and Sharing"" to the online teaching of physiology. Group tests and questionnaires were used to evaluate teaching effects. The results showed that the implementation of the ""Online Four-step Teaching of Encouraging and Sharing (OFST)"" was feasible and effective, and to a certain extent alleviated the problems of loneliness and low learning motivation of students during online learning caused by home quarantine, which was particularly helpful for long-distance inter-school and inter-discipline team learning.","Wang, Ting-Huai; Xu, Xiao-Dan; Li, Jie-Hao",Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33349828/,223

Insofar as it addresses outcome likelihood, this information is essentially quantitative in nature, which is of critical importance, because quantitative information tends to be difficult to understand and therefore inaccessible to consumers. Information professionals typically examine reading level to determine the accessibility of consumer health information, but this measure does not adequately reflect the difficulty of quantitative information, including materials addressing issues of risk and benefit. As a result, different methods must be used to evaluate this type of consumer health material. There are no standard guidelines or assessment tools for this task, but research in cognitive psychology provides insight into the best ways to present risk and benefit information to promote understanding and minimize interpretation bias. This paper offers an interdisciplinary bridge that brings these results to the attention of information professionals, who can then use them to evaluate consumer health materials addressing risks and benefits.","Burkell, Jacquelyn",Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15098049/,223
193782,[Translational control of the picornavirus phenotype].,2001,"Some of the interactions between the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and the porcine interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) system were studied. In a first experiment, it was shown that pretreatment of primary porcine alveolar macrophages (AMs) with recombinant porcine (rPo) IFN-alpha 1 resulted in significant reductions of PRRSV yield and numbers of antigen expressing cells. In a second experiment, sensitivity of PRRSV to IFN-alpha was confirmed in vivo. In pigs inoculated with porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV)--a potent inducer of endogenous IFN-alpha in the lungs of pigs--followed 2 days later by PRRSV--lung PRRSV titers were 1.7 to 2.9 log10 TCID50 reduced compared to those in singly PRRSV inoculated pigs. It was concluded therefore that PRRSV has a fairly good sensitivity to the antiviral effects of IFN-alpha. A third experiment documented that in vivo PRRSV infection generally does not affect PRCV-induced IFN-alpha production in the lungs of pigs. In addition, it was shown that the IFN-inducing capacity of PRRSV is at least 159 times lower than that of PRCV. This finding suggests that cells other than AMs may be responsible for IFN production in the lungs of pigs.","Buddaert, W; Van Reeth, K; Pensaert, M",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9782316/,223

METHODS The two truncated fragments of S gene were separately cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-15b and expressed in E.coli. The resulting recombinant proteins, rS(a) and rS(b), were purified by affinity chromatography. The full-length S gene was cloned into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pSecTagB to prepare recombinant plasmid pSecS as the DNA vaccine to immunize BALB/c mice for inducing the secretion of anti-SARS-CoV protein. The immunological effect of anti-SARS-CoV antibody was tested with purified rS(a) and rS(b) proteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS Both the truncated recombinant proteins were expressed in soluble forms and reacted specifically with the sera from immunized pSecS mice and clinically diagnosed SARS patients. The prokaryotically expressed recombinant truncated S protein had similar antigenicity with SARS-CoV S protein. CONCLUSION The recombinant protein could be used as an antigen for detecting the serum of SARS CoV-infected patients.

199385,Pandemic leads NAP to pivot Annual Meeting & forum 2020,2020,"Human coronavirus HCV-229E and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), both members of coronavirus group I, use aminopeptidase N (APN) as their cellular receptors. These viruses show marked species specificity in receptor utilization as they can only use APN of their respective species to initiate virus infection. Feline and canine coronaviruses are also group I coronaviruses. To determine whether feline APN could serve as a receptor for feline coronaviruses (FCoVs), we cloned the cDNA encoding feline APN (fAPN) by PCR from feline cells and stably expressed it in FCoV-resistant mouse or hamster cells. These became susceptible to infection with either of several biotypes of FCoVs. The expression of recombinant fAPN also made hamster and mouse cells susceptible to infection with other group I coronaviruses, including several canine coronavirus strains, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and human coronavirus HCV-229E. Thus, fAPN served as a functional receptor for each of these coronaviruses in group I. As expected, fAPN could not serve as a receptor for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a group II coronavirus which uses murine biliary glycoproteins as receptors. Thus, fAPN acts as a common receptor for coronaviruses in group I, in marked contrast to human and porcine APN glycoproteins which serve as receptors only for human and porcine coronaviruses, respectively. These observations suggest that cats could serve as a ""mixing vessel"" in which simultaneous infection with several group I coronaviruses could lead to recombination of viral genomes.","Tresnan, D B; Holmes, K V",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9782266/,223

However, radiolabelled IBV that lacked S1 attached to erythrocytes and chick kidney cells to the same or similar extent as did intact virus. Treatment of IBV with a phospholipase C preparation, required to make IBV cause HA, did not increase binding of IBV to erythrocytes. The results indicate that while the attachment to cells of virus that lacks S1 is qualitatively different from that of intact virus, the decline in infectivity is the consequence of the loss of some other spike function.","Cavanagh, D; Davis, P J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3014054/,223

Four non-vaccinated challenge control calves developed severe diarrhea. Twenty 6-to 7-hour-old gnotobiotic calves inoculated orally with attenuated calf diarrhea coronavirus and challenge inoculated with virulent virus 96 h later remained clinically normal during the post-vaccination and post-challenge observation period. Four non-vaccinated challenge control calves developed severe diarrhea and 2 of these died. Five-foot long isolated loops prepared in the lower ileum (Thiry-Vella loop) of newborn colostrum-deprived calves were inoculated with attenuated coronavirus. Daily loop washings were cultured for virus and tested for neutralizing antibody. Peak viral titers of 10(6.5) to 10(7) occurred 3-4 days PI and descended rapidly to 0 between 6 and 8 days PI. Neutralizing antibody was first detected in the washings 6-8 days PI and reached a titer of 128-256 7 to 9 days PI. Loop immunoglobulin separated by gel filtration and identified by immunodiffusion were primarily IgM and IgA. Initial resistance to virulent viral infection is thought to be due to an interference phenomenon, with later resistance due to local antibody.","Mebus, C A; Torres-Medina, A; Twiehaus, M J; Bass, E P",Developments in biological standardization,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/986330/,223

This article reports trends in and discusses the relation between international migration and HIV infection in Japan. The authors analyze relevant literature, drawing on government and other sources. Among foreigners in Japan, there were 27.0 reported HIV and 9.3 reported AIDS cases per million in 1990, and 52.9 HIV and 38.8 AIDS cases per million in 2000. These rates were initially 45 to 90 times the population prevalence of HIV and AIDS among Japanese, but are now only 10 to 20 times the prevalence among Japanese, as HIV becomes an increasing problem for the Japanese population. HIV-infected foreigners who are uninsured are at a disadvantage for diagnosis, counseling, and treatment compared with insured persons, and at a significantly higher risk for low CD4 counts. For all sections of Japan's population, counseling and testing are inadequate, and surveillance of behavioral risk, infection, and disease is limited. International migrants are at increased risk for HIV transmission and at a disadvantage for care and treatment. Japan needs both to develop policies that assist migrants and to respond to the growing threat among its nonmigrant population.","Komatsu, Ryuichi; Sawada, Takashi","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18072319/,223
201615,Can graphs mitigate against coronavirus-related cybercrime?,2020,"OBJECTIVE To analyse the multi-dimension nature of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) transmission. METHODS Based on the data of SARS in 2003 and the geographic information system of Beijing, as well as under the broad range of the theorems and techniques of data-driven and model-driven knowledge mining, hierarchical techniques were used to test the hot spots. Wavelet technique was also used to decompose Moran's I frequency to survey the spatial clustering process of SARS. For factors analysis, BW test was used to distinguish factors which influencing SARS process. In temporal aspects, susceptive-infective-removal model (SIR) without Taylor expansion was solved by a genetic-simulated annealing algorithm, that directly provided a new approach to obtain epidemic parameters from the SIR model. RESULTS Different order of spatial hot spots were noticed and the clustering were relevant with the means of transportation. Diffusion dynamics were changed along with the temporal process of SARS. Regarding factor analysis, geographic relationship, population density, the amount of doctors and hospitals appeared to be the key elements influencing the transmission of SARS. The predictable number of SARS cases evolving with time were also calculated. CONCLUSIONS Cluster detection of close contacts of SARS infective in Beijing revealed the spatial characters of urban population flow and having important implications in the prevention and control of this communicable diseases. Some human and physical environment factors played statistical significant roles in different periods during SARS epidemics. An efficient algorithm was developed to solve SIR model directly, enabling the estimation of epidemic parameters from SIR and early forecast.","Wang, Jin-feng; Meng, Bin; Zheng, Xiao-ying; Liu, Ji-yuan; Han, Wei-guo; Wu, Ji-lei; Liu, Xu-hua; Li, Xiao-wen; Song, Xin-ming",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15941497/,223

202292,Key COVID research hit by cut to UK foreign-aid budget,2021,"With the mass production and consumption of single-use plastics and other plastic products, plastic waste management and its resulting microplastic pollution have become the most noteworthy environmental issues. The main objectives of this paper were to review the regulatory measures for plastic waste reduction and recycling, analyse the trend changes on the recycled amounts of regulated plastic containers and also address the discussions on the impacts of COVID-19 on the expected increase in plastic waste. In the past two decades, the central competent authority (i.e. Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)) in Taiwan has promulgated some regulations governing plastic waste reduction and recycling, especially plastic containers. Based on the official statistics, it showed that total certified amounts of regulated plastic containers have increased from 45,552 tonnes in 1998 to 194,133 tonnes in 2019. This shift was in line with circular economy policies by the Zero Waste Program and Resource Recycling and Reuse Plan launched by the Taiwan EPA during this period. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic will impact on the regulatory policies for plastic waste management because the excess use of regulated plastic products will be temporarily permitted due to the epidemic prevention and control measures. Although the increased proportion of plastic waste in municipal solid waste (MSW) will be beneficial for the energy efficiencies of waste-to-power systems in MSW incineration plants, the recycling and reduction rates of regulated plastic containers or products could decline during the COVID-19 breakout.","Tsai, Wen-Tien",Waste Manag Res,,223

METHODS: We focus on four key health care policy decisions made by the administration in response to the public health emergency: rejecting a special Marketplace enrollment period; failing to use its full powers to enhance state Medicaid emergency options; refusing to suspend the public charge rule; and failing to target provider relief funds to providers serving the uninsured. FINDINGS: In each case, the administration's policy choices intensified, rather than mitigated, structural racism and racial health inequality. Its choices had a disproportionate adverse impact on minority populations and patients who are more likely to depend on public programs, be poor, experience pandemic-related job loss, lack insurance, rely on health care safety net providers, and be exposed to public charge sanctions. CONCLUSIONS: Ending structural racism in health care and promoting racial health care equity demands an equity-mindful approach to the pursuit of policies that enhance-rather than undermine-health care accessibility and effectiveness and resources for the poorest communities and the providers that serve them.","Rosenbaum, Sara; Handley, Morgan; Morris, Rebecca; Casoni, Maria",J. health polit. policy law,,223

Methods: An online survey composed of 32 questions was developed and validated by an international expert panel. Results: Overall, 502 respondents from 40 countries across six continents completed the survey. The mean number (±SD) of ICU beds was 64 ± 84. The most popular initial diagnostic tools used for treatment initiation were arterial blood gas (48%) and clinical presentation (37.5%), while the national COVID-19 guidelines were the most used (61.2%). High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) (53.8%), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) (47%), and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (92%) were mostly used for mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 cases, respectively. However, only 38.8%, 56.6% and 82.9% of the respondents had standard protocols for HFNC, NIV, and IMV, respectively. The most frequently used modes of IMV and NIV were volume control (VC) (36.1%) and continuous positive airway pressure/pressure support (CPAP/PS) (40.6%). About 54% of the respondents did not adhere to the recommended, regular ventilator check interval. The majority of the respondents (85.7%) used proning with IMV, with 48.4% using it for 12-16 hours, and 46.2% had tried awake proning in combination with HFNC or NIV. Increased staff workload (45.02%), lack of trained staff (44.22%) and shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) (42.63%) were the main barriers to COVID-19 management. Conclusion: Our results show that general clinical practices involving ventilatory support were highly heterogeneous, with limited use of standard protocols and most frontline clinicians depending on isolated and varied management guidelines. We found increased staff workload, lack of trained staff and shortage of PPE to be the main limiting factors affecting global COVID-19 ventilatory support management.","Alqahtani, Jaber S; Mendes, Renata G; Aldhahir, Abdulelah; Rowley, Daniel; AlAhmari, Mohammed D; Ntoumenopoulos, George; Alghamdi, Saeed M; Sreedharan, Jithin K; Aldabayan, Yousef S; Oyelade, Tope; Alrajeh, Ahmed; Olivieri, Carlo; AlQuaimi, Maher; Sullivan, Jerome; Almeshari, Mohammed A; Esquinas, Antonio",J Multidiscip Healthc,,223

Face masks have become increasingly accepted as one of the most effective means for combating the spread of the disease, when used in combination with social-distancing and frequent hand-washing. However, there is an increasing trend of people substituting regular cloth or surgical masks with clear plastic face shields, and with masks equipped with exhalation valves. One of the factors driving this increased adoption is improved comfort compared to regular masks. However, there is a possibility that widespread public use of these alternatives to regular masks could have an adverse effect on mitigation efforts. To help increase public awareness regarding the effectiveness of these alternative options, we use qualitative visualizations to examine the performance of face shields and exhalation valves in impeding the spread of aerosol-sized droplets. The visualizations indicate that although face shields block the initial forward motion of the jet, the expelled droplets can move around the visor with relative ease and spread out over a large area depending on light ambient disturbances. Visualizations for a mask equipped with an exhalation port indicate that a large number of droplets pass through the exhale valve unfiltered, which significantly reduces its effectiveness as a means of source control. Our observations suggest that to minimize the community spread of COVID-19, it may be preferable to use high quality cloth or surgical masks that are of a plain design, instead of face shields and masks equipped with exhale valves.","Verma, Siddhartha; Dhanak, Manhar; Frankenfield, John",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00125v1.pdf,223

In this work we analyzed the effects of 707 governmental interventions published up to May 22, 2020, and population adherence thereof, on the dynamics of COVID-19 cases across all 27 Brazilian states, with emphasis on state capitals and remaining inland cities. A generalized SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed) model with a time-varying transmission rate (TR), that considers transmission by asymptomatic individuals, is presented. We analyze the effect of both the extent of enforced measures across Brazilian states and population movement on the changes in the TR and effective reproduction number. The social mobility reduction index, a measure of population movement, together with the stringency index, adapted to incorporate the degree of restrictions imposed by governmental regulations, were used in conjunction to quantify and compare the effects of varying degrees of policy strictness across Brazilian states. Our results show that population adherence to social distance recommendations plays an important role for the effectiveness of interventions and represents a major challenge to the control of COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries.","Jorge, Daniel C P; Rodrigues, Moreno S; Silva, Mateus S; Cardim, Luciana L; da Silva, Nívea B; Silveira, Ismael H; Silva, Vivian A F; Pereira, Felipe A C; de Azevedo, Arthur R; Amad, Alan A S; Pinho, Suani T R; Andrade, Roberto F S; Ramos, Pablo I P; Oliveira, Juliane F",Epidemics,,223

The tremendous number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the United States has resulted in a large population of survivors with prolonged post-infectious symptoms. The creation of multidisciplinary post-COVID-19 clinics to address both persistent symptoms and potential long-term complications requires an understanding of the acute disease and the emerging data regarding COVID-19 outcomes. Experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, post-acute respiratory distress syndrome complications, and post-intensive care syndrome also informs anticipated sequelae and clinical program design. Post-COVID-19 clinical programs should be prepared to care for individuals previously hospitalized with COVID-19 (including those who required critical care support), non-hospitalized individuals with persistent respiratory symptoms following COVID-19 infection, and individuals with pre-existing lung disease complicated by COVID-19. Effective multidisciplinary collaboration models leverage lessons learned during the early phases of the pandemic to overcome the unique logistical challenges posed by pandemic circumstances. Collaboration between clinicians and researchers across disciplines will provide insight into survivorship that may shape the treatment of both acute disease and chronic complications. In this review, we discuss the aims, general principles, elements of design, and challenges of a successful multidisciplinary model to address the needs of COVID-19 survivors.","Lutchmansingh, Denyse D; Knauert, Melissa P; Antin-Ozerkis, Danielle E; Chupp, Geoffrey; Cohn, Lauren; Dela Cruz, Charles S; Ferrante, Lauren E; Herzog, Erica L; Koff, Jonathan; Rochester, Carolyn L; Ryu, Changwan; Singh, Inderjit; Tickoo, Mayanka; Winks, Vikki; Gulati, Mridu; Possick, Jennifer D",Chest,,223
221671,A model-based approach to assess epidemic risk,2020-09-27,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) targets multiple organs and causes severe coagulopathy. Histopathological organ changes might not only be attributable to a direct virus-induced effect, but also the immune response. The aims of this study were to assess the duration of viral presence, identify the extent of inflammatory response, and investigate the underlying cause of coagulopathy. Methods: This prospective autopsy cohort study was done at Amsterdam University Medical Centers (UMC), the Netherlands. With informed consent from relatives, full body autopsy was done on 21 patients with COVID-19 for whom autopsy was requested between March 9 and May 18, 2020. In addition to histopathological evaluation of organ damage, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and the composition of the immune infiltrate and thrombi were assessed, and all were linked to disease course. Findings: Our cohort (n=21) included 16 (76%) men, and median age was 68 years (range 41-78). Median disease course (time from onset of symptoms to death) was 22 days (range 5-44 days). In 11 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 tropism, SARS-CoV-2 infected cells were present in multiple organs, most abundantly in the lungs, but presence in the lungs became sporadic with increased disease course. Other SARS-CoV-2-positive organs included the upper respiratory tract, heart, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. In histological analyses of organs (sampled from nine to 21 patients per organ), an extensive inflammatory response was present in the lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. In the brain, extensive inflammation was seen in the olfactory bulbs and medulla oblongata. Thrombi and neutrophilic plugs were present in the lungs, heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, and brain and were most frequently observed late in the disease course (15 patients with thrombi, median disease course 22 days [5-44]; ten patients with neutrophilic plugs, 21 days [5-44]). Neutrophilic plugs were observed in two forms: solely composed of neutrophils with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), or as aggregates of NETs and platelets.. Interpretation: In patients with lethal COVID-19, an extensive systemic inflammatory response was present, with a continued presence of neutrophils and NETs. However, SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were only sporadically present at late stages of COVID-19. This suggests a maladaptive immune response and substantiates the evidence for immunomodulation as a target in the treatment of severe COVID-19.

Local guidelines recommended that the patient should be initiated on continuous positive airway pressure while investigations were awaited, however given the examination findings an emergency portable chest radiograph was performed. The chest radiograph demonstrated a left-sided tension pneumothorax. This was treated with emergency needle decompression, with good effect, followed by chest drain insertion. A repeat chest radiograph demonstrated lung re-expansion, and the patient was admitted to a COVID-19 specific ward for further observation. This case demonstrates tension pneumothorax as a possible complication of suspected COVID-19 and emphasises the importance of thorough history-taking and clinical examination.","Flower, Luke; Carter, John-Paul L; Rosales Lopez, Juan; Henry, Alun Marc",BMJ case reports,,223

223342,Answering the Call,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). While molecular-based testing is used to diagnose COVID-19, serologic testing of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 is used to detect past infection. While most serologic assays are qualitative, a quantitative serologic assay was recently developed that measures antibodies against the S protein, the target of vaccines. Quantitative antibody determination may help determine antibody titer, facilitate longitudinal monitoring of the antibody response, including antibody response to vaccines. We evaluated the quantitative Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay. Specimens from 167 PCR-positive patients and 103 control specimens were analyzed using the Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay on the cobas e411 (Roche Diagnostics). Analytical evaluation included assessing linearity, imprecision, and analytical sensitivity. Clinical evaluation included assessing clinical sensitivity, specificity, cross-reactivity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and serial sampling from the same patient. The Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay exhibited highest sensitivity of 84.0% 15-30 days post-PCR positivity, no cross-reactivity, specificity and PPV of 100%, and NPV between 98.3%-99.8% &#8805;14 days post-PCR positivity, depending on the seroprevalence estimate. Imprecision was <2% at 9.06 U/mL across 6 days, the negative QC was consistently negative (<0.40 U/mL), the manufacturer's claimed limit of quantitation of 0.40 U/mL was verified, and linearity across the analytical measuring range was observed, except at the low end (<20 U/mL).

224563,A two-patch epidemic model with nonlinear reinfection,2019-07-21,"This paper employs the multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-DCCA) model to estimate the nonlinear relationship between the money market rate and stock market liquidity in China from a multifractal perspective, leading to a better understanding of the complexity in the relationship between the interest rate and stock market liquidity. The empirical results show that the cross-correlations between the money market rate and stock market liquidity present antipersistence in the long run and that they tend to be positively persistent in the short run. The negative cross-correlations between the interest rate and stock market liquidity are more significant than the positive cross-correlations. Furthermore, the cross-correlations between the money market rate and stock market liquidity display multifractal characteristics, explaining the variations in the relationship between the interest rate and stock market liquidity at different time scales. In addition, the lower degree of multifractality in the cross-correlations between the money market rate and stock market liquidity confirms that it is effective for the interest rate to control stock market liquidity. The Chinese stock market liquidity is more sensitive to fluctuations in the money market rate in the short term and is inelastic in response to the money market rate in the long term. In particular, the positive cross-correlations between the money market rate and stock market liquidity in the short run become strong in periods of crises and emergencies. All the evidence proves that the interest rate policy is an emergency response rather than an effective response to mounting concerns regarding the economic impact of unexpected exogenous emergencies and that the interest rate cut policy will not be as effective as expected.","Sun, Yihong; Yuan, Xuemei",PLoS One,,223

PURPOSE: To provide an overview of the impact of pharmacist interventions on antibiotic prescribing and the resultant clinical outcomes in an outpatient antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) in the United States. METHODS: Reports on studies of pharmacist-led ASP interventions implemented in US outpatient settings published from January 2000 to November 2020 and indexed in PubMed or Google Scholar were included. Additionally, studies documented at the ClinicalTrials.gov website were evaluated. Study selection was based on predetermined inclusion criteria; only randomized controlled trials, observational studies, nonrandomized controlled trials, and case-control studies conducted in outpatient settings in the United States were included. The primary outcome was the observed differences in antibiotic prescribing or clinical benefits between pharmacist-led ASP interventions and usual care. RESULTS: Of the 196 studies retrieved for full-text review, a cumulative total of 15 studies were included for final evaluation. Upon analysis, we observed that there was no consistent methodology in the implementation of ASPs and, in most cases, the outcome of interest varied. Nonetheless, there was a trend toward improvement in antibiotic prescribing with pharmacist interventions in ASPs compared with that under usual care (P < 0.05). However, the results of these studies are not easily generalizable. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a need for a consistent approach for the practical application of outpatient pharmacist-led ASPs. Managed care organizations could play a significant role in ensuring the successful implementation of pharmacist-led ASPs in outpatient settings.","St Louis, James; Okere, Arinze Nkemdirim",Am. j. health system pharm,,223

BACKGROUND: Although some qualitative studies have been carried out in health professionals during COVID-19 pandemic, to our knowledge, no study has used the Photovoice method. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study using Photovoice was carried out between March and June 2020. METHODS: A total of 20 health professionals were recruited from public and private healthcare services. The participants were invited to share photographs about their experiences while working during COVID-19 pandemic. Following the Photovoice method, audio-recorded interviews were conducted. The data were analysed using the 'SHOWED' mnemonic, with five questions answered about each photograph. The EQUATOR checklist has been used. RESULTS/FINDINGS: Three themes emerged: (1) Personal attitudes of health professionals; (2) Support from the community; and (3) Management of institutional resources. Despite the fact that health professionals in this study were exposed to major risks while caring for patients with COVID-19' they felt a strong sense of responsibility towards the community. In order to handle these stressful situations, they used coping mechanisms, good humour and leisure, but also received support from the population, who saw them as highly skilled health professionals. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the essential role of health professionals in the COVID-19 pandemic and the tireless work they are carrying out to provided highly skilled care.

However, there are unsolved ambiguities underlying mechanisms for this growth signaling thereby creating therapeutic complications. This study shows that a vital component of the pathway CRAF is directly impacted by an end product of the cascade, glutathione transferases (GST) P1 (GSTP1), driving a previously unrecognized autocrine cycle that sustains proliferation of mKRAS and mBRAF cancer cells, independent of oncogenic stimuli. The CRAF interaction with GSTP1 occurs at its N-terminal regulatory domain, CR1 motif, resulting in its stabilization, enhanced dimerization, and augmented catalytic activity. Consistent with the autocrine cycle scheme, silencing GSTP1 brought about significant suppression of proliferation of mKRAS and mBRAF cells in vitro and suppressed tumorigenesis of the xenografted mKRAS tumor in vivo. GSTP1 knockout mice showed significantly impaired carcinogenesis of mKRAS colon cancer. Consequently, hindering the autocrine loop by targeting CRAF/GSTP1 interactions should provide innovative therapeutic modalities for these cancers.","Niitsu, Yoshiro; Sato, Yasushi; Takanashi, Kunihiro; Hayashi, Tsuyoshi; Kubo-Birukawa, Naoko; Shimizu, Fumiko; Fujitani, Naoki; Shimoyama, Rai; Kukitsu, Takehiro; Kurata, Wataru; Tashiro, Yasuyuki; Listowsky, Irving",Proc.

We hypothesized that both the pandemic per se and the consequent socio-psychological sequelae could constitute stressors for Italian population, potentially affecting the endocrine system. This study was designed to describe the effect of lockdown-related stress on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis in a cohort of young men. A prospective, observational clinical trial was carried out, including patients attending the male infertility outpatient clinic before and after the national lockdown for COVID-19 pandemic. The study provided a baseline visit performed before and a follow-up visit after the lockdown in 2020. During the follow-up visit, hormonal measurements, lifestyle habits and work management were recorded. Thirty-one male subjects were enrolled (mean age: 31.6 ± 6.0 years). TSH significantly decreased after lockdown (p = 0.015), whereas no significant changes were observed in the testosterone, luteinising hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol and prolactin serum levels. No patient showed TSH serum levels above or below reference ranges, neither before nor after lockdown. Interestingly, TSH variation after lockdown was dependent on the working habit change during lockdown (p = 0.042). We described for the first time a TSH reduction after a stressful event in a prospective way, evaluating the HPT axis in the same population, before and after the national lockdown. This result reinforces the possible interconnection between psychological consequences of a stressful event and the endocrine regulation.","Brigante, Giulia; Spaggiari, Giorgia; Rossi, Barbara; Granata, Antonio; Simoni, Manuela; Santi, Daniele",Sci Rep,,223

230080,Effects of misinformation diffusion during a pandemic,2020,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause a variety of diseases in humans. Some coronaviruses cause only mild illnesses like the common cold. While, some coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV (SARS-associated coronavirus) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have, in recent years, been able to cause severe respiratory involvement (pneumonia), leading to death in several patients. By identifying the genomic sequence of the new human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) it has been revealed that it belongs to the beta coronavirus genus. COVID-19 appears to be transmitted by a mechanism similar to the influenza virus via person to person, sneezing coughing, or contact with the secretions of infected patients. Early symptoms of these respiratory viruses include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, with an incubation period of 2-14 days. SARS-CoV-2 is an acute respiratory disease that initially causes lung damage. SARS-CoV-2 can affect other organs, including the kidneys. Kidney damage may be caused by alterations that occur during coronavirus infection. It seems that low-oxygen delivery to tissues like the kidney in the setting of this disease may lead to ischemic damage of the kidney.

230089,The Dragon,2020,"Background: Chest computed tomography (CT) has been widely used to assess pulmonary involvement in COVID-19. We aimed to investigate the correlation between chest CT and clinical features in COVID-19 suspected patients with or without fever. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 211 COVID-19 suspected patients who underwent both chest CT and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in Wuhan, China. The performance of CT in patients with relevant onset of symptoms, with fever (n = 141) and without fever (n = 70), was assessed respectively. Results: The sensitivity of CT for COVID-19 was 97.3%, with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-0.76). There were 141 suspected patients with fever and 70 without fever. In the fever group, 4 variables were screened to establish the basic model: Age, monocyte, red blood cell, and hypertension. The AUC of the basic model was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.63-0.81), while the AUC of the CT-aided model was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.85), a significant difference (P &lt;. 05). In the nonfever group, only dry cough was screened out to establish the basic model. The AUC was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.64-0.88), which was not significantly different than the CT-aided model (P =. 08). Conclusions: Chest CT has a high sensitivity in patients with COVID-19, and it can improve diagnostic accuracy for COVID-19 suspected patients with fever during the initial screen, whereas its value for nonfever patients remains questionable.","Song, Songlin; Wu, Feihong; Liu, Yiming; Jiang, Hongwei; Xiong, Fu; Guo, Xiaopeng; Zhang, Hongsen; Zheng, Chuansheng; Yang, Fan",Open Forum Infect.

230450,Poisoning the Search Space in Neural Architecture Search,2021-06-28,"How are civil society organizations responding to COVID-19’s impacts on informal settlements? In Latin America, civil society organizations have developed a repertoire of collective action, seeking to provide immediate and medium-term responses to the emergency. This paper aims to map these initiatives and identify strategic approaches to tackle the issues, given the strengths of those undertaking the initiative, and the scope, purpose and sphere of intervention. Using direct contact, a survey, and a virtual ethnography with social organizations has allowed us to identify and characterize the initiatives. The repertoire focuses on emergency measures around food security, and pedagogies for prevention, sanitation and income relief at the neighbourhood and district levels. We argue that the civil society response repertoire is diverse in form and resources but limited in scope; meanwhile the urgency of the situation and the mismatch with state action mean that crucial spheres of informality, vital to cultivating grounds for a healthy recovery phase, are being neglected.","Duque Franco, Isabel; Ortiz, Catalina; Samper, Jota; Millan, Gynna",Environ.

However, creating training data for clinical entity tasks is time consuming and sharing labeled data is challenging due to privacy concerns. The information needs of the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the need for agile methods of training machine learning models for clinical notes. We present Trove, a framework for weakly supervised entity classification using medical ontologies and expert-generated rules. Our approach, unlike hand-labeled notes, is easy to share and modify, while offering performance comparable to learning from manually labeled training data. In this work, we validate our framework on six benchmark tasks and demonstrate Trove's ability to analyze the records of patients visiting the emergency department at Stanford Health Care for COVID-19 presenting symptoms and risk factors.","Fries, Jason A; Steinberg, Ethan; Khattar, Saelig; Fleming, Scott L; Posada, Jose; Callahan, Alison; Shah, Nigam H",Nat Commun,,223

We explored the impact of COVID-19 on smoking behaviors, risk perceptions, and reactions to text messages during a statewide stay-at-home advisory among primary care patients who were trying to quit. From May-June 2020, we interviewed smokers enrolled in a 12-week, pilot cessation trial providing text messaging and mailed nicotine replacement medication (NCT04020718). Twenty-two individuals (82% white, mean age 55 years), representing 88% of trial participants during the stay-at-home advisory, completed exit interviews; four (18%) of them reported abstinence. Interviews were thematically analyzed by two coders. COVID-19-induced environmental changes had mixed effects, facilitating quitting for some and impeding quitting for others. While stress increased for many, those who quit found ways to cope with stress. Generally, participants felt at risk for COVID-19 complications but not at increased risk of becoming infected. Reactions to COVID-19 and quitting behaviors differed across age groups, older participants reported difficulties coping with isolation (e.g., feeling disappointed when a text message came from the study and not a live person). Findings suggest that cessation interventions addressing stress and boredom are needed during COVID-19, while smokers experiencing isolation may benefit from live-person supports.","Joyce, Andrea A; Styklunas, Grace M; Rigotti, Nancy A; Neil, Jordan M; Park, Elyse R; Kruse, Gina R",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,223

To date, there is no model to predict the severity of COVID-19 in elderly patients. In this study, patients who maintained a non-severe condition and patients who progressed to severe or critical COVID-19 during hospitalization were assigned to the non-severe and severe groups, respectively. Based on the admission data of these two groups in the training cohort, albumin (odds ratio [OR] = 0.871, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.809 - 0.937, P < 0.001), d-dimer (OR = 1.289, 95% CI: 1.042 - 1.594, P = 0.019) and onset to hospitalization time (OR = 0.935, 95% CI: 0.895 - 0.977, P = 0.003) were identified as significant predictors for the severity of COVID-19 in elderly patients. By combining these predictors, an effective risk nomogram was established for accurate individualized assessment of the severity of COVID-19 in elderly patients. The concordance index of the nomogram was 0.800 in the training cohort and 0.774 in the validation cohort. The calibration curve demonstrated excellent consistency between the prediction of our nomogram and the observed curve. Decision curve analysis further showed that our nomogram conferred significantly high clinical net benefit. Collectively, our nomogram will facilitate early appropriate supportive care and better use of medical resources and finally reduce the poor outcomes of elderly COVID-19 patients.","Zeng, Furong; Deng, Guangtong; Cui, Yanhui; Zhang, Yan; Dai, Minhui; Chen, Lingli; Han, Duoduo; Li, Wen; Guo, Kehua; Chen, Xiang; Shen, Minxue; Pan, Pinhua",Aging (Albany NY),,223

231682,Mathematical modeling of spatio-temporal population dynamics and application to epidemic spreading,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has put a great strain on the Russian economy and budget revenue. The study aims at furnishing an estimate of losses in personal income tax revenue in regional government budgets in 2020-2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to investigate the shortfall in tax revenues, three factors were studied: the amount of damage caused by the COVID-19 outbreak to the whole economic system;the sensitivity of the state revenue base to the crisis;the sensitivity of regional tax revenue to the revenue base. The study was based on the annual reports of the Federal Tax Service of Russia, Rosstat data, Forecast of the Social and Economic Development of the Russian Federation, and data from the ""National action plan to ensure the recovery of employment and incomes of population, economic growth and long-term structural changes in the economy"". It was found that recession will lead to a significant reduction in people's income over the given period. As a result, personal income tax revenues will decrease. The budget losses will reach 416.6 billion rubles by the end of the 2020 fiscal year. This is equivalent to 0.4% of GDP and 9.7% of total income from personal income tax in an economic situation unmarred by the pandemic. The largest fall in public revenue is expected in the regions which stand out in regard to personal income tax revenues per capita. The research results confirm the initial hypothesis that the negative impact of the pandemic on personal income tax revenues depends on the share of income tax revenues of a particular region or municipality. The findings can be used by the regional and municipal financial authorities for developing draft budgets for 2022 and the planning period of 2023-2024.","Kakaulina, M. O.",Journal of Tax Reform,,223

This study was conducted to assess the Iranian citizens' attitude about some principles and criteria for allocation of ventilators in the current COVID-19 epidemic.Materials and Methods: An electronic self-administered questionnaire was publicly distributed through social networks of Telegram and WhatsApp to perform this cross-sectional study. The questionnaire consisted of 11 statements about the selection and prioritization of patients for the use of a ventilator.Results: 1262 persons, including 767 citizens and 495 health care providers participated in this study. More than 95% of participants agreed upon the necessity to avoid discrimination and avoid prioritization according to patients' gender, economic and political status. While 40.9% of citizens and 49.6% of healthcare workers believed that a ventilator can be disconnected from a patient with a poor prognosis to help another patient who has a better prognosis (P-value = 0.13), 34.3% of people and 29.6% of healthcare workers believed that the earlier admitted patients have the right to receive the device even if the likeliness of his/her survival is less than the next patient (P-value = 0.009).Conclusions: Maximizing health benefits as a measure of ventilator allocation in the pandemic of COVID-19 is an accepted criterion. Meanwhile, periodic evaluation of patients and disconnecting the device from a patient that no longer benefits from ICU services requires its scientific and ethical basis to be brought in public discourse.","Asghari, Fariba; Parsapour, Alireza; Shamsi Gooshki, Ehsan",AJOB Empir Bioeth,,223

Despite the focus on reducing mortality by preventing the spread of the virus, patients have died due to several other complications of the illness. The understanding of pathological mechanisms and their implications is continuously evolving. A number of symptoms occur in these patients due to the involvement of various endocrine glands. These clinical presentations went largely unnoticed during the first outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003. A few of these derangements continued during the convalescence phase and sometimes occurred after recovery. Similar pathological and biochemical changes are being reported with the novel coronavirus disease outbreak in 2020. In this review, we focus on these endocrine changes that have been reported in both SARS coronavirus and SARS coronavirus-2. As we battle the pandemic, it becomes imperative to address these underlying endocrine disturbances that are contributing towards or predicting mortality of these patients.","Agarwal, Shubham; Agarwal, Sanjeev Kumar",Postgrad Med J,,223

Identifying themes in policy responses provides a framework for subsequent evaluations of the relationship between state policies and health service utilization.Methods: Between May and June 2020, we searched all Single State Agencies for Substance Abuse Services (SSA) websites for statements of SUD treatment policy responses to the pandemic. We conducted Iterative Categorization of policies for outpatient programs, opioid treatment programs, and other treatment settings to identify themes in policy responses.Results: We collected 220 documents from SSA websites from 45 states and Washington D.C. Eight specific themes emerged from our content analysis: delivery of pharmacological and non-pharmacological services, obtaining informed consent and documentation for remote services, conducting health assessments, facility operating procedures and staffing requirements, and permissible telehealth technology and billing protocols. Policy changes often mirrored federal guidance, for instance, by expanding methadone take-home options for opioid treatment programs. The extent and nature of policy changes varied across jurisdictions, including telehealth technology requirements and staffing flexibility.Conclusion: States have made significant policy changes to SUD treatment policies during COVID-19, particularly regarding telehealth and facilitation of remote care. Understanding these changes could help policymakers prioritize guidance during the pandemic and for future health crises. Impacts of policies on disparate treatment populations, including those with limited technological access, should be considered.","Andraka-Christou, Barbara; Bouskill, Kathryn; Haffajee, Rebecca L; Randall-Kosich, Olivia; Golan, Matthew; Totaram, Rachel; Gordon, Adam J; Stein, Bradley D",Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse,,223

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study. It was conducted using an electronic format survey through Qualtrics Survey Software in English. The target participants were HCPs working in any healthcare setting across Iraq. The survey was distributed via two professional Facebook groups between 7 April and 7 May 2020. The survey items were adopted with modifications from three previous studies of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Avian Influenza Outbreak. Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted to determine the difference in the pandemic impact according to the dealing with COVID-19 cases. KEY FINDINGS: The authors received 430 surveys from HCPs representing 14 provinces. Approximately 60% of the participants were dealing with diagnosis or treatment of COVID-19 cases. More than 80% perceived high risk of infection and stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, 85.9% of the HCPs had concerns of putting family and close friends at risk due to their job during the COVID-19 crisis. HCPs working in a setting dealing with diagnosis/treatment of COVID-19 cases experienced significantly higher concerns about personal and family safety compared with other HCPs. CONCLUSIONS: Working during COVID-19 pandemic has several negative impacts on HCPs including mental and physical health and an overwhelming work environment. Thus, social and emotional support is needed to help HCPs to cope with such stressful conditions. Finally, providing adequate PPE can help to minimise concerns of getting infected in the workplace.","Al-Jumaili, Ali Azeez; Al-Fatlawi, Bashar G; Al-Jalehawi, Ahmad K; Al-Hamadani, Fadya Yaqoob; Alsawad, Oday Sajjad",International journal of pharmacy practice (Online),,223

235322,Control with uncertain data of socially structured compartmental epidemic models,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recent pandemic outbreak threatening human beings worldwide. This novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infection causes severe morbidity and mortality and rapidly spreading across the countries. Therefore, there is an urgent need for basic fundamental research to understand the pathogenesis and druggable molecular targets of SARS-CoV-2. Recent sequencing data of the viral genome and X-ray crystallographic data of the viral proteins illustrate potential molecular targets that need to be investigated for structure-based drug design. Further, the SARS-CoV-2 viral pathogen isolated from clinical samples needs to be cultivated and titrated. All of these scenarios demand suitable laboratory experimental models. The experimental models should mimic the viral life cycle as it happens in the human lung epithelial cells. Recently, researchers employing primary human lung epithelial cells, intestinal epithelial cells, experimental cell lines like Vero cells, CaCo-2 cells, HEK-293, H1299, Calu-3 for understanding viral titer values. The human iPSC-derived lung organoids, small intestinal organoids, and blood vessel organoids increase interest among researchers to understand SARS-CoV-2 biology and treatment outcome. The SARS-CoV-2 enters the human lung epithelial cells using viral Spike (S1) protein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor. The laboratory mouse show poor ACE-2 expression and thereby inefficient SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, there was an urgent need to develop transgenic hACE-2 mouse models to understand antiviral agents' therapeutic outcomes. This review highlighted the viral pathogenesis, potential druggable molecular targets, and suitable experimental models for basic fundamental research.","Kanimozhi, G.; Pradhapsingh, B.; Singh Pawar, C.; Khan, H.

However, data on celiac disease (CeD) nutritional and gastroenterological remote monitoring are scanty. The aims of our study were to verify patients' trust in telemedicine and to evaluate the feasibility of telemedicine in nutritional monitoring. Material and Methods: We used telemedicine in place of the scheduled but not provided follow-up visits during the first lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients received a phone call, and televisits were conducted for CeD patients with mild or moderate symptoms and/or with blood alterations. The patient's adherence to the gluten-free diet (GFD) was evaluated according to the Celiac Dietary Adherence Test (CDAT). When gluten contamination was suspected, a point-of-care gluten detection test was prescribed. The patient's trust in telemedicine was assessed, through an adapted version of the Patient Trust Assessment Tool (PATAT) questionnaire, as the percentage of patients giving a score of at least 4 out of 5 on a Likert scale for three selected key statements: ""I can trust televisit,"" ""I can trust that possible problems with the telemedicine service will be solved properly,"" and ""I feel at ease when working with this website."" Results: One hundred and twelve CeD patients were phone called;among symptomatic patients, 39 out of the 42 scheduled (92.9%) televisits were performed. Among the 39 visits, 34 (87.2%) questionnaires were compiled. The patients included in the study obtained a CDAT score from 7 to 13 (11 +/- 2). Gluten detection tests were prescribed to 11 patients, resulting positive in 2. Trust in the telemedicine service was achieved in 94.1, 88.2, and 97.1% for the three selected key statements of the PATAT questionnaire. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine showed to be feasible and the majority of patients trusted the combined gastroenterological and nutritional televisits. Gluten detection tests demonstrated to be useful tools for the patient and for the caregiver to confirm adherence to the GFD remotely.","Costantino, A.; Roncoroni, L.; Noviello, D.; Nandi, N.; Lombardo, V.; Scricciolo, A.; Scaramella, L.; Vecchi, M.; Elli, L.",Frontiers in Nutrition,,223

Online questionnaires and telephone interviews were combined to investigate the physical activity (PA) participation and PARI occurrences every two weeks. Totally, 84 college students (men: 49; women: 35) with a mean age of 19.4 years completed the entire 1-year follow-up. Overall, 14250.3 PA exposure hours were collected and 36 PARI episodes were reported by 26 students, with an injury incidence density of 2.53 injuries per 1000 PA exposure hours and an injury risk of 0.43 injuries/student/year. July to September accounted for a highest proportion of injuries and half of the injuries happened in the evening. The majority of injuries occurred outdoors, happened in non-contact activities, were acute and involved the lower limbs, with sprains and strains being the primary injury types. Of all injuries, 80.6% resulted in PA withdrawal immediately and 58.3% led to absence from the next planned PA. No significant difference was found between men and women. This study reveals the problem of PARI among college students, which provides the direction for the prevention of PARI in this population.","Tang, Dongchun; Cai, Weicong; Gao, Yang; Chen, Shangmin; Li, Liping",Sci Rep,,223

240003,Visualizing the Virus,2020,"The Envelope (E) protein in SARS Coronavirus (CoV) is a small structural protein, incorporated as part of the envelope. A major fraction of the protein has been known to be associated with the host membranes, particularly organelles related to intracellular trafficking, prompting CoV packaging and propagation. Studies have elucidated the central hydrophobic transmembrane domain of the E protein being responsible for much of the viroporin activity in favor of the virus. However, newer insights into the organizational principles at the membranous compartments within the host cells suggest further complexity of the system. The lesser hydrophobic Carboxylic-terminal of the protein harbors interesting amino acid sequences- suggesting at the prevalence of membrane-directed amyloidogenic properties that remains mostly elusive. These highly conserved segments indicate at several potential membrane-associated functional roles that can redefine our comprehensive understanding of the protein. This should prompt further studies in designing and characterizing of effective targeted therapeutic measures.","Mukherjee, Shruti; Bhattacharyya, Dipita; Bhunia, Anirban",Biophys Chem,,223

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the prediction of future daily national confirmed COVID-19 infection growth-the percentage change in total cumulative cases-across 14 days for 114 countries using nonpharmaceutical intervention metrics and cultural dimension metrics, which are indicative of specific national sociocultural norms. METHODS: We combined the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker data set, Hofstede cultural dimensions, and daily reported COVID-19 infection case numbers to train and evaluate five non-time series machine learning models in predicting confirmed infection growth. We used three validation methods-in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and country-based cross-validation-for the evaluation, each of which was applicable to a different use case of the models. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate high R2 values between the labels and predictions for the in-distribution method (0.959) and moderate R2 values for the out-of-distribution and country-based cross-validation methods (0.513 and 0.574, respectively) using random forest and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) regression. Although these models may be used to predict confirmed infection growth, the differing accuracies obtained from the three tasks suggest a strong influence of the use case. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides new considerations in using machine learning techniques with nonpharmaceutical interventions and cultural dimensions as metrics to predict the national growth of confirmed COVID-19 infections.","Yeung, Arnold Ys; Roewer-Despres, Francois; Rosella, Laura; Rudzicz, Frank",J Med Internet Res,,223
240620,The race for antiviral drugs to beat COVID - and the next pandemic,2021,"Purpose: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reminds us of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, and up to date, corticosteroid is commonly administrated to severe patients with COVID-19. Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common disabling complication among convalescent SARS patients who received corticosteroid therapy. In China, a considerable number of convalescent SARS patients with steroid-associated ONFH had undergone conservative treatment by traditional Chinese medicine, and this study aims to evaluate the long-term results of a spleen-invigorating Huo-Gu formula (HGF) therapy in these patients. Participants and methods: A total of 33 convalescent SARS patients (9 males and 24 females) with bilateral steroid-associated ONFH (66 hips) were enrolled in this study. All patients received oral HGF therapy for 6 months when they were confirmed the diagnosis of steroid-associated ONFH. They had been regularly followed up at an interval of 1 year. Harris hip score and medical imaging modalities, including plain radiography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, were performed to evaluate the outcomes. Results: Based on average 14 years of follow-up of HGF therapy (ranging from 6 to 16 years), 38 hips (57%) among the 66 hips developed definite osteoarthritis, and 14 hips (26%) in 53 precollapse hips (Association Research Circulation Osseous [ARCO] Stage I or II) progressed to femoral head collapse (ARCO Stage III or IV). Only five patients (also 5 hips) underwent total hip arthroplasty, and the mean hip survival time was over 15 years by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. We observed a mean Harris hip score of 63 points, which represented the reserve of 55% in pain score and 70% in physical function score. The severity of groin pain was not correlated to the severity of osteoarthritis. Conclusion: Chinese herbal HGF therapy demonstrates beneficial effects on preventing femoral head collapse, delaying total hip arthroplasty, and maintaining physical function in the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH. HGF therapy might be therefore a good alternative for the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH secondary to rheumatologic and infection diseases. Translational potential of the article: HGF therapy might be a good alternative for the treatment of steroid-associated ONFH secondary to rheumatologic and infectious diseases.","Huang, Zeqing; Fu, Fanyu; Ye, Hengli; Gao, Huanhuan; Tan, Biao; Wang, Rongtian; Lin, Na; Qin, Ling; Chen, Weiheng",J Orthop Translat,,223

The increasing number of deaths due to this disease was of great concern. Therefore, our study aimed to explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 deaths. After having searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and CNKI for studies published as of August 10, 2020, we selected articles and extracted data. The meta-analysis was performed using Stata 16.0 software. Nineteen studies were used in our meta-analysis. The proportions of comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, malignancies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardio-cerebrovascular disease, and chronic liver disease were statistically significantly higher in mortal COVID-19 cases. Coagulation and inflammatory markers, such as platelet count, D-dimer, prothrombin time, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and interleukin 6, predicted the deterioration of the disease. In addition, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and mechanical ventilation predicted the poor prognosis during its progression. The COVID-19 pandemic is still evolving, placing a huge burden on healthcare facilities. Certain coagulation indicators, inflammatory indicators, and comorbidities contribute to the prognosis of patients. Our study results may help clinicians optimize the treatment and ultimately reduce the mortality rate.","Zhou, Xianghui; Cheng, Zhipeng; Shu, Dan; Lin, Wenyi; Ming, Zhangyin; Chen, Wei; Hu, Yu","Aging (Albany, N.Y.

Methods: The clinical and chest CT imaging data of 16 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed, and patients with atypical CT presentations were selected for analysis and review. Results: Of the 16 patients, 6 had atypical CT presentations, including 2 with faint ground glass opacities, 2 with single nodule, 1 with predominantly linear opacities, and 1 with predominantly reticular opacities. The dynamic changes of CT showed the faint ground glass opacities gradually became weak (2 cases). The scope of the single nodule was enlarged, and it developed into consolidation and residual fibrosis (2 cases). There was no obvious change of linear opacity (1 case). The reticular opacities were enlarged, then partially absorbed and new developed ground-glass opacities were found. Finally, the lesions were absorbed with residual fibrosis (1 case). Conclusion: Atypical CT presentations of COVID-19 can be classified as faint ground glass opacities, single nodule, linear opacities, and reticular opacities. Understanding the atypical presentation of COVID-19 is beneficial in the assessment and epidemic prevention and control of this disease.","Zhao, Yue; Liu, Xiaolong; Duan, Wenshuai; Liu, Yiyang; Du, Wei; Du, Yunjun; Zhang, Liang; Yang, Bin",,,223

As the first country with the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese government has adopted a series of timely and strict prevention and control measures against the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, which has effectively slowed down the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 and created a valuable window for the international community to overcome the epidemic. China's experience in combating the COVID-19 has shown that building a community prevention and control system is essential to control the spread of coronavirus. As the backbone of the epidemic prevention and control system, the community prevention and control system plays an important role in improving the pattern of disorderly medical treatment, screening suspected patients, preventing the input of pathogens, ensuring residents' medical needs, stabilizing public sentiment, reducing disease fear, and maintaining residents' national security. At the same time, it also exposed the problems of the community prevention and control epidemic system in terms of infrastructure, human resources, and internal systems. Based on this, this article suggests that we should improve the hardware facilities of community, improve the internal mechanism of the community, strengthen the stability of the community talent team, improve the level of linkage between the community and other departments to prevent and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, effectively use information technology and actively mobilize social forces to help community prevention and control COVID-19.","Zhang, Xiaoyan; Yang, Shiyu",Int J Health Plann Manage,,223

Employing a phenomenological framework based on a generalized Burgers' equation in a time-dependent stochastic environment, we identify four different universality classes of spin fluctuations. These comprise, aside from normal spin diffusion, three types of superdiffusive transport: the KPZ universality class and two distinct types of anomalous diffusion with multiplicative logarithmic corrections. Our predictions are supported by extensive numerical simulations on various examples of quantum and classical chains. Contrary to common belief, we demonstrate that even non-integrable spin chains can display a diverging spin diffusion constant at finite temperatures.","Nardis, Jacopo De; Medenjak, Marko; Karrasch, Christoph; Ilievski, Enej",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06432v2.pdf,223

HBP and IL-6 were measured by immunoassays at admission and on day 7 in 178 patients with pneumonia by SARS-CoV-2. Patients were classified into non-sepsis and sepsis as per the Sepsis-3 definitions and were followed up for the development of severe respiratory failure (SRF) and for outcome. Results were confirmed by multivariate analyses. HBP was significantly higher in patients classified as having sepsis and was negatively associated with the oxygenation ratio and positively associated with creatinine and lactate. Logistic regression analysis evidenced admission HBP more than 18 ng/ml and IL-6 more than 30 pg/ml as independent risk factors for the development of SRP. Their integration prognosticated SRF with respective sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive 59.1%, 96.3%, 83.9%, and 87.8%. Cox regression analysis evidenced admission HBP more than 35 ng/ml and IL-6 more than 30 pg/ml as independent risk factors for 28-day mortality. Their integration prognosticated 28-day mortality with respective sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value 69.2%, 92.7%, 42.9%, and 97.5%. HBP remained unchanged over-time course. A prediction score of the disposition of patients with COVID-19 is proposed taking into consideration admission levels of IL-6 and HBP. Using different cut-offs, the score may predict the likelihood for SRF and for 28-day outcome.","Saridaki, Maria; Metallidis, Simeon; Grigoropoulou, Sotiria; Vrentzos, Emmanouil; Lada, Malvina; Argyraki, Katerina; Tsachouridou, Olga; Georgiadou, Anna; Vasishta, Anil; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J",Eur. j. clin. microbiol. infect. dis,,223

A few reports suggest the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from mothers to their neonates. Most neonates have mild symptoms, but some develop multisystem involvement and shock. Case Presentation: We report two cases of possible SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission from mothers to their neonates. The first case shows maternal infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the second trimester followed by recurrent infection in the third trimester right before the delivery. The infant demonstrated respiratory distress soon after delivery along with myocardial dysfunction and multi-organ system involvement. The second case shows maternal infection with SARS-COV-2 at the time of delivery with preterm labor secondary to placental abruption, with that delivery resulting in the preterm neonate requiring non-invasive ventilation with multisystem involvement in the context of persistently positive SARS-COV-2 PCR in the neonate. Both neonates were treated with IVIG along with steroids. Both neonates recovered fully and were discharged and allowed to go home. Conclusion: In neonates, COVID-19 usually presents as an asymptomatic or mild illness;some may develop a more severe course. Our two cases, however, demonstrate that multisystem involvement, although rare, is possible. This report also supports the current evidence of possible vertical transmission from mothers to their neonates.

Radiographic abnormality was frequently associated irrespective of clinical presentation and its severity. Poor prognosis was noted in elderly, especially those with co-morbidities. Discussion: Though the disease has a relatively mild course in this part of the subcontinent, patients aged &#8805;60 are at significant risk for morbidity and mortality. Clinical and laboratory findings are similar to those found in viral diseases. Increased risk of cardiac involvement needs to be looked into. Chest X-ray proves sufficient for imaging, reducing the requirement of CT scans. Studies involving larger sample size and interventional trials are need of the hour.","Saluja, Manoj; Pillai, Drishya; Jeliya, Shivcharan; Bauddh, Nitesh; Chandel, Rahul",J Assoc Physicians India,,223

249369,"G7 Pensions: ESG, SDGs, Green Growth and the Road to Camp David",2020,"The pandemic has strongly marked the Italian territory and had had consequences in the healthy sphere, as it is clear, and also in the social and economic fabric of the countries. The lockdown, the adoption of health safety measures and the closure of borders had immediate consequences in economies and territories. Thus, the health emergency became also a tourism and socio-economic issue. In particular, in Italy, tourism has been one of the pillars of the economic system, and certainly the impact of COVID-19 on the national tourism market has been dramatic. The tourism crisis highlighted some of the rooted tourist issues in Italy, involving, in particular, the tourist management of territories. In order to restart the design of a healthy tourism system, capable of promoting the survival of tourism and territories, had to be considered as necessary elements to restart Italian tourism such as the role of high education for quality tourism, the design of a hybrid offer to favor the development of domestic tourism and the exploration of the digital and technological field as a support tool for territorial, tourism and communication policies.","Cocco, V.",Almatourism-Journal of Tourism Culture and Territorial Development,,223
249467,Unified Dual-view Cognitive Model for Interpretable Claim Verification,2021-05-20,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact human health and welfare on a global level. In March 2020, stringent national restrictions were enforced in the UK to protect public health and slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Restrictions were likely to have resulted in collateral consequences for the health and welfare of horses and ponies, especially those at risk of obesity and laminitis and this issue warranted more detailed exploration. The current study utilised qualitative methodology to investigate the implications of COVID-19 related policies upon equine management and welfare with a focus on horses and ponies at risk of laminitis and obesity. Twenty-four interviews with five sub-groups of key equestrian welfare stakeholders in the UK were conducted between May and July of 2020 to understand the challenges facing equine welfare in the context of laminitis and obesity susceptible animals. Thematic analysis revealed lockdown-associated factors with the potential to compromise welfare of horses and ponies at risk of obesity and laminitis. These included: disparate information and guidance, difficulties enacting public health measures in yard environments, and horses having reduced exercise during the pandemic. Positive examples of clear and consistent information sharing by farriers were reported to have improved horse owner understanding of routine hoof care during lockdown. Analysis suggested that the recommendations for supporting the management-based needs of horses under reduced supervision were not clearly defined, or were not sufficiently disseminated, across the equine industry. These findings support the development of guidelines specific to the care of horses and ponies at risk of obesity and laminitis through collaborative input from veterinary and welfare experts, to reduce the negative impacts of future lockdown events in the UK.","Ward, Ashley B; Stephen, Kate; Argo, Caroline McGregor; Harris, Patricia A; Watson, Christine A; Neacsu, Madalina; Russell, Wendy; Grove-White, Dai H; Morrison, Philippa K",PLoS One,,223

249737,An Existential Analysis of Responses to the 2020 Coronavirus Outbreak,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Since December 2019, when the first SARS-CoV2 infections have been reported, the number of cases has increased exponentially. In our University Hospital Unit, the first patient with COVID-19 was admitted on the 8th of March 2020. We aimed to investigate the predictors of death among inpatients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective, monocentric study, consecutively enrolling patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were collected from the 8th of March to the 8th of April 2020. We aimed to describe the most frequent clinical and laboratory features and predictors of death among patients admitted to our Unit. RESULTS: 87 patients were enrolled, 56 (64.4%) were male, with a median age of 72 (IQR 62.5-83.5) years. The majority of our population had at least one comorbidity in their medical anamnesis. Hypertension and cardiovascular disease were the most frequent, followed by obesity. Eighty (92%) patients had at least one symptom, whereas 7 (8%) were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were fever and dyspnoea. Overall, 53 patients had lung disease confirmed at CT scan (60.9%). Twenty-five (28.7%) deaths occurred. Statistically significant predictors of death at multivariate analysis were lymphocytes count <900 cells/mm3, moderate ARDS, and lack of compliance at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first Italian experience available. Our results seem to be in line with international literature. As highlighted by our data, more studies are needed to investigate the role of lymphocytes subsets, CT scan values. Furthermore, therapy choice and timing in this challenging setting should be urgently investigated in randomized clinical trials.","De Vito, A; Geremia, N; Fiore, V; Princic, E; Babudieri, S; Madeddu, G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,223

250831,Poster Presentations,2021,"BACKGROUND: Different levels of control measures were introduced to contain the global COVID-19 pandemic, many of which have been controversial, particularly the comprehensive use of diagnostic tests. Regular testing of high-risk individuals (pre-existing conditions, older than 60 years of age) has been suggested by public health authorities. The WHO suggested the use of routine screening of residents, employees, and visitors of long-term care facilities (LTCF) to protect the resident risk group. Similar suggestions have been made by the WHO for other closed facilities including incarceration facilities (e.g., prisons or jails), wherein parts of the U.S., accelerated release of approved inmates is taken as a measure to mitigate COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Here, the simulation model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) is extended to investigate the effect of regularly testing of employees to protect immobile resident risk groups in closed facilities. The reduction in the number of infections and deaths within the risk group is investigated. Our simulations are adjusted to reflect the situation of LTCFs in Germany, and incarceration facilities in the U.S. COVID-19 spreads in closed facilities due to contact with infected employees even under strict confinement of visitors in a pandemic scenario without targeted protective measures. Testing is only effective in conjunction with targeted contact reduction between the closed facility and the outside world-and will be most inefficient under strategies aiming for herd immunity. The frequency of testing, the quality of tests, and the waiting time for obtaining test results have noticeable effects. The exact reduction in the number of cases depends on disease prevalence in the population and the levels of contact reductions. Testing every 5 days with a good quality test and a processing time of 24 hours can lead up to a 40% reduction in the number of infections. However, the effects of testing vary substantially among types of closed facilities and can even be counterproductive in U.S. IFs. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of COVID-19 in closed facilities is unavoidable without a thorough screening of persons that can introduce the disease into the facility. Regular testing of employees in closed facilities can contribute to reducing the number of infections there, but is only meaningful as an accompanying measure, whose economic benefit needs to be assessed carefully.","Tsoungui Obama, Henri Christian Junior; Adil Mahmoud Yousif, Nessma; Alawam Nemer, Looli; Ngougoue Ngougoue, Pierre Marie; Ngwa, Gideon Akumah; Teboh-Ewungkem, Miranda; Schneider, Kristan Alexander",PLoS One,,223
250839,Modeling and Decoupling Systemic Risk,2021-07-21,"The main active components of saffron are crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, and safranal. There are many studies on their cardioprotective effects, but their cardiotoxicities have not been reported. The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) K+ channels are of considerable pharmaceutical interest as the target responsible for acquired long QT syndromes. The aim of this study is to explore the effects of crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, and safranal on the K+ channels encoded by hERG. The interaction of these components with the rapid delayed rectification of K+ currents (IKr) were studied using the perforated patch recording technique. Crocin and picrocrocin had no significant effects on IKr, but crocetin and safranal inhibited hERG K+ currents in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 36.35 µM and 37.86 µM, respectively. The maximum inhibitory effects were 37.74 ± 4.14% and 33.74 ± 4.81%, respectively, and the effects were reversible upon washout. The results demonstrate that crocetin and safranal significantly inhibit hERG K+ current, but crocin and picrocrocin do not. This suggests that crocetin and safranal may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias by inhibiting IKr.","Jin, Weiyue; Xue, Yurun; Xue, Yucong; Liang, Yingran; Zhang, Yixin; Zhang, Jianping; Chu, Xi; Wang, Hongfang; Guan, Shengjiang",Gen Physiol Biophys,,223
250880,The AstroCamp Project,2021-01-10,"The COVID-19 pandemic has driven rapid, widespread adoption of telemedicine. The distribution of clinicians, long travel distances, and disability all limit access to care, especially for persons with Parkinson's disease. Telemedicine is not a panacea for all of these challenges but does offer advantages. These advantages can be summarized as the 5 C's: accessible care, increased convenience, enhanced comfort, greater confidentiality to patients and families, and now reduced risk of contagion. Telemedicine also has its limitations, including the inability to perform parts of the physical examination and inequitable access to the Internet and related technologies. Future models will deliver care to patients from a diverse set of specialties. These will include mental health specialists, physiotherapists, neurosurgeons, speech-language therapists, dieticians, social workers, and exercise coaches. Along with these new care models, digital therapeutics, defined as treatments delivered through software programs, are emerging. Telemedicine is now being introduced as a bridge to restart clinical trials and will increasingly become a normal part of future research studies.

250972,Our Shared Purpose: Practicing Gratitude,2020,"The utilization of insect-based feeds (IBF) as an alternative protein source is increasingly gaining momentum worldwide owing to recent concerns over the impact of food systems on the environment. However, its large-scale adoption will depend on farmers’ acceptance of its key qualities. This study evaluates farmer’s perceptions of commercial IBF products and assesses the factors that would influence its adoption. It employs principal component analysis (PCA) to develop perception indices that are subsequently used in multiple regression analysis of survey data collected from a sample of 310 farmers. Over 90% of the farmers were ready and willing to use IBF. The PCA identified feed performance, social acceptability of the use of insects in feed formulation, feed versatility and marketability of livestock products reared on IBF as the key attributes that would inform farmers’ purchase decisions. Awareness of IBF attributes, group membership, off-farm income, wealth status and education significantly influenced farmers’ perceptions of IBF. Interventions such as experimental demonstrations that increase farmers’ technical knowledge on the productivity of livestock fed on IBF are crucial to reducing farmers’ uncertainties towards acceptability of IBF. Public partnerships with resource-endowed farmers and farmer groups are recommended to improve knowledge sharing on IBF.","Okello, Afrika Onguko Jonathan Makau Nzuma Otieno David Jakinda Kidoido Michael Tanga Chrysantus Mbi",Sustainability,,223

This scoping review is designed at clarifying the concepts on how the findings of Aspergillus spp. in COVID-19 patients were interpreted. We searched Medline to identify the studies on Aspergillus spp. findings in COVID-19 patients. Included were observational studies containing the following information: explicit mention of the total number of the study population, study period, reason for obtaining respiratory samples, case definition, and clinical outcomes. Excluded were case series, case reports and reviews. Identified were 123 publications, and 8 observational studies were included. From the included studies the following issues were identified. The proportion of immunocompromised patients considered as host factors varied from 0 to 17%. Most of the studies did not mention radiographic findings explicitly. Respiratory samples were mostly obtained to investigate clinical deterioration. Aspergillus culture, antigen or PCR testing on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were performed in between 23.3% and 66.3% of the study population. Two studies performed periodic samples of BAL. Galactomannan index (GI) positivity in BAL was between 10% and 28%. GI in blood was found in 0.9% to 6.7% of the available samples. The prevalence of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis ranged from 2.7% to 27.7%. Studies compared the mortality between defined cases and non-cases, and all showed increased mortality in cases. No studies showed that antifungal treatment reduced mortality. Concluding, this review showed how studies defined the clinical entity COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis where positive Aspergillus test in the respiratory sample was the main driver for the diagnosis. There were many differences between studies in terms of test algorithm and Aspergillus test used that largely determined the prevalence. Whether antifungal therapy, either as prophylaxis, pre-emptive or targeted therapy will lead to better outcomes of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis patients is still need to be answered.","Yusuf, Erlangga Seghers Leonard Hoek Rogier A.

Active video games could be a way to maintain physical therapy at home as part of the rehabilitation. The aim of this review is to summarise the current best evidence for the effectiveness of home-based active video games on gait and balance, user compliance, feasibility and safety for pwMS. METHODS: We searched for studies in five databases (PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, CINAHL and Science direct) up to October 2020. Selection of studies, extraction of data and methodological quality assessment through the PEDro scale were made independently by two authors and discussed with a third author. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in this systematic review. We found significant improvements in balance; results were mixed concerning mobility, physical activity and gait. Home-based active video games are feasible and safe, with good compliance and adherence. The methodological quality of the studies was moderate (PEDro scale: 5.3 ± 2). CONCLUSION: Overall, home-based active video games were found safe and effective improving static and dynamic balance in pwMS. Compliance was good, probably because it is a motivating and enjoyable training. Active video games can be a relevant alternative for physical rehabilitation at home in pwMS. Future studies should follow more rigorous methodological standards (larger sample sizes, more randomised controlled trials) to improve the quality of evidence and include cost-effectiveness in the analysis.","Dalmazane, Marion; Gallou-Guyot, Matthieu; Compagnat, Maxence; Magy, Laurent; Montcuquet, Alexis; Billot, Maxime; Daviet, Jean-Christophe; Perrochon, Anaick",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,223
254713,A Spatial Markov Chain Cellular Automata Model for the Spread of Viruses,2020-04-12,"Anatomists are well placed to tackle the transition from face-to-face to blended learning approaches as a result of the rapidly forced changes brought about by Covid-19. The subject is extremely visual and has, therefore, previously been a target for the development of technology-enhanced learning initiatives over the last ten years. Today's students have come to expect the integration of technology in the classroom and remotely. They adjust quickly to the innovative use of new applications and software and have begun to integrate it within their own workflow for note taking and study aids. Given the intense drive toward blended deliveries of anatomy as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is easy to picture how the benefits of working in partnership with students (in order to achieve many of these aims) would be possible, particularly in difficult subjects like neuroanatomy. In doing so, it provides anatomists with new opportunities to engage students in a way that aligns well with best practice frameworks for engaging students through partnership. The current United Kingdom guidelines set out by Advance HE (a professional membership organization for promoting excellence in higher education) strongly encourages the higher education community to seek out appropriate academic contexts where a balance of power can be struck between staff and student to create a community of practice. If such an approach can be fully embraced by anatomists, a strong argument can be made for seizing the opportunity to optimize the benefits of student partnership work in this discipline.","Border, Scott; Woodward, Charlotte; Kurn, Octavia; Birchall, Cara; Laurayne, Hailey; Anbu, Deepika; Taylor, Charlie; Hall, Samuel",Anat Sci Educ,,223

255178,Teaching Economics with Interactive Browser-Based Models,2020-08-06,"Bone homeostasis requires continuous remodeling of bone matrix to maintain structural integrity. This involves extensive communication between bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts to orchestrate balanced progenitor cell recruitment and activation. Only a few mediators controlling progenitor activation are known to date and have been targeted for intervention of bone disorders such as osteoporosis. To identify druggable pathways, we generated a medaka (Oryzias latipes) osteoporosis model, where inducible expression of receptor-activator of nuclear factor kappa-&#914; ligand (Rankl) leads to ectopic formation of osteoclasts and excessive bone resorption, which can be assessed by live imaging. Here we show that upon Rankl induction, osteoblast progenitors up-regulate expression of the chemokine ligand Cxcl9l. Ectopic expression of Cxcl9l recruits mpeg1-positive macrophages to bone matrix and triggers their differentiation into osteoclasts. We also demonstrate that the chemokine receptor Cxcr3.2 is expressed in a distinct subset of macrophages in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM). Live imaging revealed that upon Rankl induction, Cxcr3.2-positive macrophages get activated, migrate to bone matrix, and differentiate into osteoclasts. Importantly, mutations in cxcr3.2 prevent macrophage recruitment and osteoclast differentiation. Furthermore, Cxcr3.2 inhibition by the chemical antagonists AMG487 and NBI-74330 also reduced osteoclast recruitment and protected bone integrity against osteoporotic insult. Our data identify a mechanism for progenitor recruitment to bone resorption sites and Cxcl9l and Cxcr3.2 as potential druggable regulators of bone homeostasis and osteoporosis.","Phan, Quang Tien; Tan, Wen Hui; Liu, Ranran; Sundaram, Sudha; Buettner, Anita; Kneitz, Susanne; Cheong, Benedict; Vyas, Himanshu; Mathavan, Sinnakaruppan; Schartl, Manfred; Winkler, Christoph",Proc.

Socially deprived areas demonstrated higher possibility of infection spread even with moderate connectivity of the PGS. The study demonstrated that only applying a uniform social distancing measure without characterising the infrastructure and social conditions may lead to higher infection transmission.","Pan, Jiayu Bardhan Ronita Jin Ying",Urban Forestry &amp; Urban Greening,,223

256987,Deciphering Coronavirus,2020,"PurposeThe fundamental theory of Modigliani and Miller (1958) states that a firm's financing decisions are independent from the firm's value. Nevertheless, several empirical studies as well as theoretical approaches from the past decade impugn this relation for real markets with their immanent inefficiencies. However, these questions are rather than academic in nature: Especially the influence of macroeconomic conditions on the market perception of debt issues is from high economic importance, since the need for new liquidity usually becomes even more urgent when the economic conditions worsen.Design/methodology/approachThis paper analyzes the reaction of shareholders to the issue of debt by Latin American firms under special consideration of the macroeconomic sentiment. To do so, a sample of debt issued by Latin American companies between 2003 and 2010 is empirically examined through an event study.FindingsThe authors empirically demonstrate that specifically in Latin America, debt issuing companies show a significant underperformance during recessionary periods and an overperformance during nonrecessionary periods. These findings differ from previous results for mature capital markets. The authors conclude that not only the overall economic conditions matter to explain stock market reactions on bond issues but also the maturity of the corporate debt market plays an important role.Originality/valueThe authors provide first evidence that the previously described changes in the returns on specific stocks depending on the economic sentiment (Baker and Wurgler, 2006) are under certain conditions also present in the market for corporate debt.","Berninger, Marc Fiesenig Bruno Schiereck Dirk",The Journal of Risk Finance,,223
257814,Revisiting the prioritization of emotional information in iconic memory,2020,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe acute respiratory symptoms. Due to the lack of medical countermeasures, effective and safe vaccines against MERS-CoV infection are urgently required. Although different types of candidate vaccines have been developed, their immunogenicity is limited, and the dose and administration route need optimization to achieve optimal protection. We here investigated the potential use of human ß-defensin 2 (HBD 2) as an adjuvant to enhance the protection provided by MERS-CoV vaccination. We found that immunization of human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4)-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mice with spike protein receptor-binding domain (S RBD) conjugated with HBD 2 (S RBD-HBD 2) induced potent antigen (Ag)-specific adaptive immune responses and protected against MERS-CoV infection. In addition, immunization with S RBD-HBD 2 alleviated progressive pulmonary fibrosis in the lungs of MERS-CoV-infected hDPP4-Tg mice and suppressed endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling activation upon viral infection. Compared to intramuscular administration, intranasal administration of S RBD-HBD 2 induced more potent mucosal IgA responses and was more effective for protecting against intranasal MERS-CoV infection. In conclusion, our findings suggest that HBD 2 potentiates Ag-specific immune responses against viral Ag and can be used as an adjuvant enhancing the immunogenicity of subunit vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV.","Kim, Ju; Yang, Ye Lin; Jeong, Yongsu; Jang, Yong-Suk",,,223

We report on the validation of the Vitros Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total (CoV2T) assay for qualitative serologic testing of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. METHODS: We performed validation studies according to Commission of Office Laboratories Accreditation guidelines, using samples previously tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We evaluated precision, analytical interferences, and cross-reactivity with other viral infections; evaluated concordance with molecular and other serologic testing; and evaluated seroconversion. RESULTS: The Vitros CoV2T assay exhibited acceptable precision and did not exhibit cross-reactivity with other acute respiratory virus infections. The CoV2T assay exhibited 100% negative predictive agreement (56/56) and 71% positive predictive agreement (56/79) with RT-PCR across all patient samples and was concordant with other serologic assays. Concordance with RT-PCR was 97% more than 7 days after symptom onset. The CoV2T assay was robust to icterus and lipemia but had interference from significant hemolysis. CONCLUSIONS: The Vitros CoV2T assay was successfully validated in our laboratory. We anticipate it will be a useful tool in screening for exposure to SARS-CoV-2; however, the use of the CoV2T and other serologic assays in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 is unknown and must be evaluated in future studies.","Garnett, Emily; Jung, Joanna; Tam, Estella; Rajapakshe, Deepthi; Cheney, Stephen; Brown, Cameron; Cao, Jing; Muldrew, Kenneth; Singh, Ila; Versalovic, James; Devaraj, Sridevi",Am J Clin Pathol,,223

The pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients is thought to relate to a thromboinflammatory state within the pulmonary vasculature, triggered by the infection, but other risk factors such as reduced mobility, prolonged immobilisation and dehydration are likely to contribute. Several societies have released comprehensive guidelines emphasising the importance of risk stratification in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. They advocate the use of clinically validated risk scores in conjunction with biochemical and imaging results. Patients with mild disease can now be managed in the outpatient setting and with newly developed therapies, such as catheter-directed thrombolysis, becoming available in more centres, treatment options for those with more severe disease are also expanding. This article presents four theoretical but realistic cases, each diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism, but differing in levels of severity. These demonstrate how the guidelines can be applied in a clinical setting, with particular focus on risk stratification and management.","Stevenson, Alexander; Davis, Sarah; Murch, Nick",Br J Hosp Med (Lond),,223

Recent findings suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus pathogen that causes COVID-19, could elicit a cytokine storm that drives edema, dysfunction of the airway exchange, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in the lung, followed by acute cardiac injury and thromboembolic events leading to multiorgan failure and death. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), owing to their powerful immunomodulatory abilities, have the potential to attenuate the cytokine storm and have therefore been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for which several clinical trials are underway. Given that intravenous infusion of MSCs results in a significant trapping in the lung, MSC therapy could directly mitigate inflammation, protect alveolar epithelial cells, and reverse lung dysfunction by normalizing the pulmonary microenvironment and preventing pulmonary fibrosis. In this review, we present an overview and perspectives of the SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory dysfunction and the potential of MSC immunomodulation for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 related pulmonary disease.","Song, Na; Wakimoto, Hiroaki; Rossignoli, Filippo; Bhere, Deepak; Ciccocioppo, Rachele; Chen, Kok-Siong; Khalsa, Jasneet Kaur; Mastrolia, Ilenia; Samarelli, Anna Valeria; Dominici, Massimo; Shah, Khalid",Stem cells (Dayt.),,223

261246,From the Editor-in-Chief: Issue at a Glance,2021,"The intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic has tested the mettle of political, healthcare and public health leaders over the past year. Amid the unfolding events, healthcare leaders, including many nurses, have been pivoting, innovating, collaborating, safeguarding, inspiring and navigating - all the while informing the creation of an effective playbook to wage a counterassault for all of us. Despite all efforts, this previously unseen opponent has been unrelenting. Having been in the eye of the storm during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, my memories of the events remain vivid. It was a time rife with uncertainty and fear, forcing the creation of a playbook on the basis of the best evidence and common sense but without the benefit of a precedent. Over the course of several months, our leadership was challenged by efforts to contain the virus and mitigate the very real possibility of a globally emerging pandemic. However, SARS was but a microcosm of the present situation. The COVID-19 pandemic is not like any other crisis we have experienced in our collective lifetime. We can only imagine the toll of this pandemic when it is finally over. It will be measured in terms of post-pandemic posttraumatic stress disorder, deaths from COVID-19 and delayed care, and deaths by suicide among healthcare workers and citizens; in the end, it will not be trivial. Those contributing to the COVID-19 playbook have given their all, and we should be eternally grateful to every single one of them.","Nagle, Lynn M",Nurs Leadersh (Tor Ont),,223
262919,Through the Virtual Looking Glass,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly evolving infectious/inflammatory disorder which has turned into a global pandemic. With severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as its etiologic agent, severe COVID-19 cases usually develop uncontrolled inflammatory responses and cytokine storm-like syndromes. Measuring serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and others) as inflammatory biomarkers may have several potential applications in the management of COVID-19, including risk assessment, monitoring of disease progression, determination of prognosis, selection of therapy and prediction of response to treatment.This is especially true for pediatric patients with COVID-19 associated Kawasaki-like disease and similar syndromes. In this report, we review the current knowledge of COVID-19 associated cytokines, their roles in host immune and inflammatory responses, the clinical significance and utility of cytokine immunoassays in adult and pediatric COVID-19 patients, as well as the challenges and pitfalls in implementation and interpretation of cytokine immunoassays. Given that cytokines are implicated in different immunological disorders and diseases, it is challenging to interpret the multiplex cytokine data for COVID-19 patients. Also, it should be taken into consideration that biological and technical variables may affect the commutability of cytokine immunoassays and enhance complexity of cytokine immunoassay interpretation. It is recommended that the same method, platform and laboratory should be used when monitoring differences in cytokine levels between groups of individuals or for the same individual over time. It may be important to correlate cytokine profiling data with the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification testing and imaging observations to make an accurate interpretation of the inflammatory status and disease progression in COVID-19 patients.","Liu, Benjamin M; Martins, Thomas B; Peterson, Lisa K; Hill, Harry R",Cytokine,,223

In order to develop adequate countermeasures against Covid-19, identification and structural characterization of suitable antiviral targets within the SARS-CoV-2 protein repertoire is urgently needed. The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) is a multifunctional and highly immunogenic determinant of virulence and pathogenicity, whose main functions consist in oligomerizing and packaging the single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viral genome. Here we report the structural and biophysical characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 N C-terminal domain (CTD), on which both N homo-oligomerization and ssRNA binding depend. Crystal structures solved at 1.44 Å and 1.36 Å resolution describe a rhombus-shape N CTD dimer, which stably exists in solution as validated by size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation. Differential scanning fluorimetry revealed moderate thermal stability and a tendency towards conformational change. Microscale thermophoresis demonstrated binding to a 7-bp SARS-CoV-2 genomic ssRNA fragment at micromolar affinity. Furthermore, a low-resolution preliminary model of the full-length SARS-CoV N in complex with ssRNA, obtained by cryo-electron microscopy, provides an initial understanding of self-associating and RNA binding functions exerted by the SARS-CoV-2 N.","Zinzula, Luca; Basquin, Jerome; Bohn, Stefan; Beck, Florian; Klumpe, Sven; Pfeifer, Günter; Nagy, István; Bracher, Andreas; Hartl, F Ulrich; Baumeister, Wolfgang",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,,223

264803,European Academy of Andrology: Annual Report 2020,2021,"BACKGROUND: Gender and race are known to impact attitudes toward mental health topics and help-seeking behavior. Men and minorities are more likely to cite stigma as a reason for not seeking help for mental health concerns, which is of particular relevance given the high rate of suicide in men and challenges of historic proportion currently facing minority communities. Instagram provides a platform to discuss mental health, though a lack of male and minority representation may further alienate these populations. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate whether men and nonwhite individuals are underrepresented in Instagram photos tagged with #mentalhealth (compared to photos tagged with #health) to better understand how gender and race-based representations are manifested on this popular social media platform and discuss the implications. METHODS: Three investigators of different genders and racial backgrounds met on nine different days via teleconference to analyze a total of 215 publicly available Instagram photos tagged with #mentalhealth and 215 with #health. These photos were generated using Instagram's search function, and search results were sorted by most recently published at the time of data collection. For each photo, the three investigators recorded their observations about the gender (male versus female) and race (white versus nonwhite versus racially unclassifiable) of subjects featured in the photo, which they did not discuss with other investigators. Chi-squared analysis was performed on each investigator's data set to compare the frequency of male versus female and white versus nonwhite subjects identified in each hashtag category. Kappa interrater agreement was calculated for each investigator pair, category (gender or race), and hashtag. RESULTS: All three investigators observed significantly more female as compared to male subjects in photos tagged with #mentalhealth (X2=14.4, P<.001 for all investigators) while observing no significant difference between numbers of male and female subjects in photos tagged with #health (X2=1.533, P=.22; X2=1.241, P=.27; X2=0.096, P=.76). All three investigators identified significantly more white than nonwhite subjects in photos tagged with both #health and #mentalhealth (X2 values range from 11.912 to 98.927, P<.001 for all). Kappa interrater agreement revealed almost perfect agreement for gender (kappa=0.908-0.992) with the agreement for race ranging from 0.614 to 0.822, depending on hashtag and rater pair. CONCLUSIONS: Women are featured more frequently than men in Instagram photos tagged with #mentalhealth. The topic of #health, meanwhile, is not gendered this way. Low visibility of mental health among men may both represent and exacerbate existing stigma and barriers to care. White subjects are featured significantly more frequently than nonwhite subjects in photos tagged with both #mentalhealth and #health. Directed interventions using the Instagram platform may be indicated to increase the visibility of underrepresented groups and break the cycle of stigma.","Utter, Kierstin; Waineo, Eva; Bell, Capricia M; Quaal, Harrison L; Levine, Diane L",JMIR Ment Health,,223
265065,Why WHO needs a feminist economic agenda,2020,"With the global integration development, the linkage between countries is strengthened in the dynamic spillover effects between BRIC and G7 from 2009 to 2020. We find that G7 is the exporter of risk, and BRIC is the receiver of the risk. We build the spillover model from the DAG-SVAR model. In the static spillover analysis, the net spillover of G7 is higher than that of BRIC. In the dynamic spillover analysis, the total systemic spillover is highly consistent with the world’s risk events. We also consider the directional spillover between G7 and BRIC, and find the volatility spillover of G7 to other markets is higher than that of BRIC. Furthermore, we use the European Debt Crisis, the China-US Trade War, and the Covid-19 Pandemic to study the spillover network’s dynamic evolution. We find that the global financial market’s spillover network is enhanced, and the volatility net spillover increased rapidly after the corresponding events. Specifically, after the Wuhan lockdown, China’s net spillover increased sharply to 264%, ranked first globally, and the net volatility spillover connectedness increased substantially after the Covid-19 Pandemic. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Zhang, P.; Sha, Y.; Xu, Y.",Emerging Markets Finance and Trade,,223
265199,Developing Precision Microbiome Medicines,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The Network for Genomic Surveillance in South Africa (NGS-SA) was formed to investigate the introduction and understand the early transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in South-Africa. DESIGN: This paper presents the first results from this group, which is a molecular epidemiological study of the first 21 SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes sampled in the first port of entry - KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) - during the first month of the epidemic. By combining this with calculations of the effective reproduction number (R), it aimed to shed light on the patterns of infections in South Africa. RESULTS: Two of the largest provinces - Gauteng and KZN - had a slow growth rate for the number of detected cases, while the epidemic spread faster in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape. The estimates of transmission potential suggested a decrease towards R = 1 since the first cases and deaths, but a subsequent estimated R average of 1.39 between 6-18 May 2020. It was also demonstrated that early transmission in KZN was associated with multiple international introductions and dominated by lineages B1 and B. Evidence for locally acquired infections in a hospital in Durban within the first month of the epidemic was also provided. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa was very heterogeneous in its spatial dimension, with many distinct introductions of SARS-CoV2 in KZN and evidence of nosocomial transmission, which inflated early mortality in KZN. The epidemic at the local level was still developing and NGS-SA aimed to clarify the dynamics in South Africa and devise the most effective measures as the outbreak evolved.","Giandhari, Jennifer; Pillay, Sureshnee; Wilkinson, Eduan; Tegally, Houriiyah; Sinayskiy, Ilya; Schuld, Maria; Lourenço, José; Chimukangara, Benjamin; Lessells, Richard; Moosa, Yunus; Gazy, Inbal; Fish, Maryam; Singh, Lavanya; Sedwell Khanyile, Khulekani; Fonseca, Vagner; Giovanetti, Marta; Carlos Junior Alcantara, Luiz; Petruccione, Francesco; de Oliveira, Tulio",Int J Infect Dis,,223

Therefore, automated COVID-19 diagnosis models are essential to identify the existence of disease from radiological images. Earlier studies have focused on the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques using X-ray images on COVID-19 diagnosis. This paper aims to develop a Deep Learning Based MultiModal Fusion technique called DLMMF for COVID-19 diagnosis and classification from Computed Tomography (CT) images. The proposed DLMMF model operates on three main processes namely Weiner Filtering (WF) based pre-processing, feature extraction and classification. The proposed model incorporates the fusion of deep features using VGG16 and Inception v4 models. Finally, Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB) based classifier is applied for identifying and classifying the test CT images into distinct class labels. The experimental validation of the DLMMF model takes place using open-source COVID-CT dataset, which comprises a total of 760 CT images.

On trust, natural disasters, and pandemics in the Ecuadorian Amazon",2020,"OBJECTIVE: To describe clinically pertinent challenges of managing sedation in COVID-19 patients on venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) and describe considerations for enhanced safety and efficacy of pharmacological agents used. DATA SOURCES: A PubMed search was performed using the following search terms: ECMO, ARDS, sedation, COVID-19, coronavirus, opioids, analgesia, fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine, oxycodone, methadone, ketamine, propofol, dexmedetomidine, clonidine, benzodiazepines, midazolam, lorazepam, and diazepam. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Relevant clinical and pharmacokinetic studies were considered. All studies included were published between January 1988 and March 2021. DATA SYNTHESIS: Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 may progress to requiring VV-ECMO support. Agents frequently used for sedation and analgesia in these patients have been shown to have significant adsorption to ECMO circuitry, leading to possible diminished clinical efficacy. Use of hydromorphone-based analgesia has been associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients on VV-ECMO. However, safety and efficacy regarding use of other agents in this patient population remains an area of further research. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review addresses clinical challenges associated with sedation management in COVID-19 patients requiring VV-ECMO support and provides potential strategies to overcome these challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Historically, sedation and analgesia management in patients requiring ECMO support have posed a challenge for bedside clinicians given the unique physiological and pharmacokinetic changes in this patient population. A multimodal strategy to managing analgesia and sedation should be used, and the use of enteral agents may play a role in reducing parenteral agent requirements.","Dreucean, Diane; Harris, Jesse E; Voore, Prakruthi; Donahue, Kevin R",Ann Pharmacother,,223

""Healthcare Professions of Prevention"" is the fourth area and it is fundamental for the National Health Service. In particular, in this pandemic emergency situation, the contribution of the Prevention Technicians in the Environment and Workplaces (PTEW) is essential in the field and workplace management. The ""Core Competence"" of the PTEW is to carry out, with professional autonomy, prevention, verification, and control activities in the field of hygiene and safety of living and working environments. In the hospitals, the indications provided by national and/or regional authorities are implemented through procedures on good hygiene practices developed by PTEW (e.g., hand hygiene, ""respiratory tract hygiene,"" environmental hygiene, social distancing, and use of Personal Protective Equipment). One of the activities is the health surveillance on the field by population monitoring. The protocols foreseen for the ""in-flow of workers"" involve a wider control between social life and work. The PTEW will use a Check List divided into 3 macro phases: Entry, Activity Context, and Exit, defining each behavior of the work phases with a constant presence of verification of the procedures. The PTEW will be a Leader on the topics of education, training, and persuasion, considering a New Principle that ""transforms the worker as active part in the application and diffusion of the safety measures"".","Wachocka, Malgorzata; Pattavina, Fabio; Palluzzi, Vincenzo; Cerabona, Vito; Laurenti, Patrizia",Front Public Health,,223

Since the detection of the first COVID-19 case on 5th March 2020, the Royal Government of Bhutan implemented a number of containment measures including border closure and national lockdowns. Against the backdrop of this global COVID-19 pandemic response, there was a sudden surge of locally-transmitted malaria cases between June to August 2020. There were 20 indigenous cases (zero Plasmodium falciparum and 20 Plasmodium vivax) from a total of 49 cases (seven P. falciparum and 42 P. vivax) in 2020 compared to just two from a total of 42 in 2019. Over 80% of the cases were clustered in malaria endemic district of Sarpang. This spike of malaria cases was attributed to the delay in the delivery of routine malaria preventive interventions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, Bhutan is unlikely to achieve the national goal of malaria elimination by 2020.","Penjor, Kinley; Zangpo, Tandin; Clements, Archie C A; Gray, Darren J; Wangdi, Kinley",Malar J,,223

We aimed to describe the temporal trends in respiratory outcomes over 12 months in patients hospitalised for severe COVID-19 and to investigate the associated risk factors. METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal, cohort study, patients admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19 who did not require mechanical ventilation were prospectively followed up at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after discharge from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. Patients with a history of hypertension; diabetes; cardiovascular disease; cancer; and chronic lung disease, including asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; or a history of smoking documented at time of hospital admission were excluded at time of electronic case-note review. Patients who required intubation and mechanical ventilation were excluded given the potential for the consequences of mechanical ventilation itself to influence the factors under investigation. During the follow-up visits, patients were interviewed and underwent physical examination, routine blood test, pulmonary function tests (ie, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide [DLCO]; forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of forced vital capacity [FVC]; functional residual capacity; FVC; FEV1; residual volume; total lung capacity; and vital capacity), chest high-resolution CT (HRCT), and 6-min walk distance test, as well as assessment using a modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale (mMRC). FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, and March 31, 2020, of 135 eligible patients, 83 (61%) patients participated in this study. The median age of participants was 60 years (IQR 52-66). Temporal improvement in pulmonary physiology and exercise capacity was observed in most patients; however, persistent physiological and radiographic abnormalities remained in some patients with COVID-19 at 12 months after discharge. We found a significant reduction in DLCO over the study period, with a median of 77% of predicted (IQR 67-87) at 3 months, 76% of predicted (68-90) at 6 months, and 88% of predicted (78-101) at 12 months after discharge. At 12 months after discharge, radiological changes persisted in 20 (24%) patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed increasing odds of impaired DLCO associated with female sex (odds ratio 8·61 [95% CI 2·83-26·2; p=0·0002) and radiological abnormalities were associated with peak HRCT pneumonia scores during hospitalisation (1·36 [1·13-1·62]; p=0·0009). INTERPRETATION: In most patients who recovered from severe COVID-19, dyspnoea scores and exercise capacity improved over time; however, in a subgroup of patients at 12 months we found evidence of persistent physiological and radiographic change. A unified pathway for the respiratory follow-up of patients with COVID-19 is required.

268130,Artificial Intelligence Applied to Chest X-ray for Differential Diagnosis of COVID-19 Pneumonia,2021,"BACKGROUND: The faecal immunochemical test (FIT) was introduced to triage patients with low-risk symptoms of possible colorectal cancer in English primary care in 2017, underpinned by little primary care evidence. METHODS: All healthcare providers in the South West of England (population 4 million) participated in this evaluation. 3890 patients aged &#8805;50 years presenting in primary care with low-risk symptoms of colorectal cancer had a FIT from 01/06/2018 to 31/12/2018. A threshold of 10 µg Hb/g faeces defined a positive test. RESULTS: Six hundred and eighteen (15.9%) patients tested positive; 458 (74.1%) had an urgent referral to specialist lower gastrointestinal (GI) services within three months. Forty-three were diagnosed with colorectal cancer within 12 months. 3272 tested negative; 324 (9.9%) had an urgent referral within three months. Eight were diagnosed with colorectal cancer within 12 months. Positive predictive value was 7.0% (95% CI 5.1-9.3%). Negative predictive value was 99.8% (CI 99.5-99.9%). Sensitivity was 84.3% (CI 71.4-93.0%), specificity 85.0% (CI 83.8-86.1%). The area under the ROC curve was 0.92 (CI 0.86-0.96). A threshold of 37 µg Hb/g faeces would identify patients with an individual 3% risk of cancer. CONCLUSIONS: FIT performs exceptionally well to triage patients with low-risk symptoms of colorectal cancer in primary care; a higher threshold may be appropriate in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.","Bailey, Sarah E R; Abel, Gary A; Atkins, Alex; Byford, Rachel; Davies, Sarah-Jane; Mays, Joe; McDonald, Timothy J; Miller, Jon; Neck, Catherine; Renninson, John; Thomas, Paul; Walter, Fiona M; Warren, Sarah; Hamilton, Willie",Br J Cancer,,223

269207,Interactive Extractive Search over Biomedical Corpora,2020,"OBJECTIVES: to study the cumulative incidence, the demographics and health conditions of the population tested for COVID-19, and to map the evolving distribution of individual cases in the population of the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region (North-Eastern Italy). DESIGN: population-based observational study based on a record linkage procedure of databases included in the electronic health information system of the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the study group consisted of individuals who resided in the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region and who underwent COVID-19 testing from 01.03 to 24.04.2020. The study group was identified from the laboratory database, which contains all the microbiological testing performed in regional facilities. Tested people were categorized into positive or negative cases, based on test results. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: probability of being tested for and cumulative incidence of COVID-19. RESULTS: the cumulative probability of being tested for COVID-19 was 278/10,000 inhabitants, while the cumulative incidence was 22 cases/10,000. Out of 33,853 tested people, 2,744 (8.1%) turned out to be positive for COVID-19. Women were tested more often than men (337 vs 216/10,000), and they showed a higher incidence of infection than men (25 and 19 infected cases/10,000 residents, respectively). Both cumulative incidence and cumulative probability of being tested were higher in the elderly population. About 25% of infected people was hosted in retirement homes and 9% was represented by healthcare workers. Thirty seven percent of positive cases had hypertension, 15% cardiologic diseases, while diabetes and cancer characterized 11.7% and 10% of the infected population, respectively. The geographic distribution of positive cases showed a faster spread of the infection in the city of Trieste, an urban area with the highest regional population density. CONCLUSIONS: the COVID-19 pandemic did not hit the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region as hard as other Northern Italian Regions. In the early phase, as documented in this study, the COVID-19 pandemic particularly affected women and elderly people, especially those living in retirement homes in Trieste.","Calagnan, Elena; Gobbato, Michele; Burba, Ivana; Del Zotto, Stefania; Toffolutti, Federica; Serraino, Diego; Tonutti, Giuseppe",Epidemiol Prev,,223

How transmissible is SARS-CoV-2? How severely affected are patients infected with SARS-CoV-2? What are the risk factors for viral infection? What are the differences between this novel coronavirus and other coronaviruses? To answer these questions, we performed a comparative study of four pathogenic viruses that primarily attack the respiratory system and may cause death, namely, SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and influenza A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2 strains). This comparative study provides a critical evaluation of the origin, genomic features, transmission, and pathogenicity of these viruses. Because the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing, this evaluation may inform public health administrators and medical experts to aid in curbing the pandemic's progression.","Abdelrahman, Zeinab; Li, Mengyuan; Wang, Xiaosheng",Front Immunol,,223

Objective: To determine the susceptibility of the skin to SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the expression of viral entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in this organ. Method: A comprehensive analysis of human tissue gene expression databases was carried out looking for the presence of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes in the skin. mRNA expression of these genes in skin-derived human cell lines was also assessed. Results: The analyses showed high co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the gastrointestinal tract and kidney, but not in the skin. Only the human immortalized keratinocyte HaCaT cell line expressed detectable levels of ACE2, and no cell line originating in the skin expressed TMPRSS2. Conclusions: Our results suggest that cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19 cannot be directly attributed to the virus. It is possible that cutaneous blood vessels endothelial damage, as well as the effect of circulating inflammatory mediators produced in response to the virus, are the cause of skin involvement.","Garduño-Soto, Myriam; Choreño-Parra, José A",Gac Med Mex,,223

The model included the fundamental parameters on which the transmission rate of the infection is dependent, like the population density, contact rate, recovery rate, and intensity of the infection in the respective region. Looking at the great diversity in different geographic locations in India, we determined to calculate the basic reproduction number for all Indian districts based on the COVID-19 data till 7 July 2020. By preparing district-wise spatial distribution maps with the help of ArcGIS 10.2, the model was employed to show the effect of complete lockdown on the transmission rate of the COVID-19 infection in Indian districts. Moreover, with the model’s transformation to the fractional ordered dynamical system, we found that the nature of the proposed SIR model is different for the different order of the systems. The sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number is done graphically which forecasts the change in the transmission rate of COVID-19 infection with change in different parameters. In the numerical simulation section, oscillations and variations in the model compartments are shown for two different situations, with and without lockdown.","Shah, Nita H.; Suthar, Ankush H.; Jayswal, Ekta N.; Sikarwar, Ankit",J,,223

275158,Shree Vishna Rasiah,2020,"Coronaviruses (CoV) have caused a number of major epidemics in humans and animals, including the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has brought a renewed focus on the evolution and interspecies transmission of coronaviruses. Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), which was recently identified in piglets in southern China, is an alphacoronavirus that originates from the same genus of horseshoe bats as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and that was reported to be capable of infecting cells from a broad range of species, suggesting a considerable potential for interspecies transmission. Given the importance of the coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein in host range determination and viral entry, we report a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the SADS-CoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation at a 3.55-Å resolution. Our structure reveals that the SADS-CoV S trimer assumes an intrasubunit quaternary packing mode in which the S1 subunit N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and the S1 subunit C-terminal domain (S1-CTD) of the same protomer pack together by facing each other in the lying-down state. SADS-CoV S has several distinctive structural features that may facilitate immune escape, such as a relatively compact architecture of the S trimer and epitope masking by glycan shielding. Comparison of SADS-CoV S with the spike proteins of the other coronavirus genera suggested that the structural features of SADS-CoV S are evolutionarily related to those of the spike proteins of the other genera rather than to the spike protein of a typical alphacoronavirus. These data provide new insights into the evolutionary relationship between spike glycoproteins of SADS-CoV and those of other coronaviruses and extend our understanding of their structural and functional diversity.IMPORTANCE In this article, we report the atomic-resolution prefusion structure of the spike protein from swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). SADS-CoV is a pathogenic alphacoronavirus that was responsible for a large-scale outbreak of fatal disease in pigs and that was reported to be capable of interspecies transmission. We describe the overall structure of the SADS-CoV spike protein and conducted a detailed analysis of its main structural elements. Our results and analyses are consistent with those of previous phylogenetic studies and suggest that the SADS-CoV spike protein is evolutionarily related to the spike proteins of betacoronaviruses, with a strong similarity in S1-NTDs and a marked divergence in S1-CTDs. Moreover, we discuss the possible immune evasion strategies used by the SADS-CoV spike protein. Our study provides insights into the structure and immune evasion strategies of the SADS-CoV spike protein and broadens the understanding of the evolutionary relationships between coronavirus spike proteins of different genera.","Guan, Hongxin; Wang, Youwang; Perculija, Vanja; Saeed, Abdullah F U H; Liu, Yichang; Li, Jinyu; Jan, Syed Sajid; Li, Yu; Zhu, Ping; Ouyang, Songying",J. virol,,223

277235,Words Matter,2020,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of the acceptance of national governments’ restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the citizens’ safety perceptions of daily life and future plans. In particular, the aim is to examine the relationship among the citizens who belong to Generations Y and Z and who represent the future of tourism markets, as tourists and as host communities, in three important receiving countries, namely, Egypt, Portugal and Turkey. Design/methodology/approach: This pilot project gathers data from three important receiving countries located on two continents involving 348 residents from Generations Y and Z. To identify the factors underlying the “acceptance of restrictions and measures” and the “Impacts of the COVID-19 threat on safety perceptions” a factor analysis was carried out. Notably, Pearson's correlation coefficient and a multiple linear regression analysis allowed to analyze the relationships between the two factors and a Kruskal–Wallis test was used to assess the influence of individuals’ country of residence. Findings: The results reveal that in general, young generations accepted the measures and restrictions imposed by the respective governments. In addition, the present pandemic has a strong impact on their safety perception in daily lives and future plans to travel. Moreover, results prove that between the three countries there are dissimilarities showing that the countries' situation regarding COVID-19 influences those two dimensions. Research limitations/implications: This study adds to the development of studies on the impacts of health risks in tourism activity, specifically on the safety measures adopted and their impacts on local receiving communities. It shows that the current pandemic is severely affecting the daily lives and plans for the future of citizens and tourists, which is in accordance with previous studies. Practical implications: The outcome of this study paves the way for policy-makers in the tourism industry because it presents experiences from Generations Y and Z members, future customers and tourist products consumers, but also from receiving communities. Social implications: The results of this study bring some light on how local communities, specifically, the younger generations, are facing this pandemic period and on the impact it has on the way they face daily life, future plans and on their level of acceptance of a sector as important as tourism. Originality/value: To the knowledge, besides the relevant studies already conducted on the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the tourism field, no study has yet been carried out to analyze how residents have reacted and accepted the restrictions and security measures imposed by their national governments and their impact on residents’ feelings and perceptions, daily lives and travel plans. Furthermore, the specific impacts of this crisis will have on the younger generations are yet to be analyzed. © 2020, International Tourism Studies Association.","Seabra, C.; AlAshry, M.; Çınar, K.; Raja, I.; Reis, M.; Sadiq, N.",International Journal of Tourism Cities,,223

Telemedicine should be vigorously promoted to reduce the risk of infections and to offer medical assistance to restricted patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to understand physicians' attitudes toward and perspectives of telemedicine during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to provide support for better implementation of telemedicine. METHODS: We surveyed all physicians (N=148), from October 17 to 25, 2020, who attended the clinical informatics PhD program at West China Medical School, Sichuan University, China. The physicians came from 57 hospitals in 16 provinces (ie, municipalities) across China, 54 of which are 3A-level hospitals, two are 3B-level hospitals, and one is a 2A-level hospital. RESULTS: Among 148 physicians, a survey response rate of 87.2% (129/148) was attained. The average age of the respondents was 35.6 (SD 3.9) years (range 23-48 years) and 67 out of 129 respondents (51.9%) were female. The respondents come from 37 clinical specialties in 55 hospitals located in 14 provinces (ie, municipalities) across Eastern, Central, and Western China. A total of 94.6% (122/129) of respondents' hospitals had adopted a telemedicine system; however, 34.1% (44/129) of the physicians had never used a telemedicine system and only 9.3% (12/129) used one frequently (&#8805;1 time/week). A total of 91.5% (118/129) and 88.4% (114/129) of physicians were willing to use telemedicine during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Physicians considered the inability to examine patients in person to be the biggest concern (101/129, 78.3%) and the biggest barrier (76/129, 58.9%) to implementing telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine is not yet universally available for all health care needs and has not been used frequently by physicians in this study. However, the willingness of physicians to use telemedicine was high. Telemedicine still has many problems to overcome.","Liu, Jialin; Liu, Siru; Zheng, Tao; Bi, Yongdong",JMIR Med Inform,,223

Initial treatment included doxycycline, hydroxychloroquine and prednisolone, which was suspended due to long-term clinical stability. Four months after prednisolone suspension, the patient presented with right periorbital oedema and erythema. Ophthalmological examination revealed restricted eye movements. A computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated signs of myositis. The patient was treated with anti-inflammatory and antibiotic drugs, that induced remission of the orbitopathy. During the following two years, she presented three relapses, affecting both the right or the left eyes. The last episode was also associated with systemic corticosteroid tapering. Orbitopathy is a rare form of WD presentation and the diagnosis of this condition may be challenging. As the clinical spectrum may range from an incidentaloma to a severe compressive neuropathy, proper recognition and management of WD orbitopathy is essential.","Sampaio, Filipa; Moreira, Jorge; Jordão, Sofia; Vieira, Bruna; Pereira, Sara; Carvalho, Rui",Orbit,,223

However, whilst there are widely available neutralization assays for S antibodies, there is no assay for N-antibody activity. Here, we present a simple in vitro method called EDNA (electroporated-antibody-dependent neutralization assay) that provides a quantitative measure of N-antibody activity in unpurified serum from SARS-CoV-2 convalescents. We show that N antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 intracellularly and cell-autonomously but require the cytosolic Fc receptor TRIM21. Using EDNA, we show that low N-antibody titres can be neutralizing, whilst some convalescents possess serum with high titres but weak activity. N-antibody and N-specific T-cell activity correlates within individuals, suggesting N antibodies may protect against SARS-CoV-2 by promoting antigen presentation. This work highlights the potential benefits of N-based vaccines and provides an in vitro assay to allow the antibodies they induce to be tested.","Albecka, Anna; Clift, Dean; Vaysburd, Marina; Rhinesmith, Tyler; Caddy, Sarah L; Favara, David M; Baxendale, Helen E; James, Leo C",EMBO J,,223

Chinese nationals older than 18 were eligible for the survey. The survey collected 5,761 questionnaires from the 31 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of mainland China. 99.7% and 97.2% of the respondents answered correctly that respiratory droplets and direct contact were the main transmission routes. 73.3% of the respondents considered COVID-19 to be 'serious' or 'very serious'. When going to the hospital, 96.9% (2,885/2,976 had gone to a hospital) used a mask during the COVID-19 epidemic, while 41.1% (2,367/5,761) did not use a mask before the epidemic. Among the respondents that used public transportation and went shopping, 99.6% and 99.4%, respectively, wore masks. Among respondents who returned to work, 75.5% wore a mask at the workplace, while 86.3% of those who have not returned to work will choose to use masks when they return to the workplace. The Chinese public is highly likely to use a mask during COVID-19 epidemic, and the mask usage changed greatly since the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, public education has played an important role during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Sun, Cheng Xi; He, Bin; Mu, Di; Li, Pei Long; Zhao, Hong Ting; Li, Zhi Li; Zhang, Mu Li; Feng, Lu Zhao; Zheng, Jian Dong; Cheng, Ying; Cui, Ying; Li, Zhong Jie",Biomed Environ Sci,,223

We used Google Trends to analyze regional searches relating to loss of smell and taste across Italy, Spain, France, Brazil, and the United States of America and determined the association with reported Covid-19 cases. METHODS: In order to retrieve the data, we built a Python software program that provides access to Google Trends data via an application program interface. Daily COVID-19 case data for subregions of the five countries selected were retrieved from respective national health authorities. We sought to assess the association between raw search interest data and COVID-19 new daily cases per million for all regions individually. RESULTS: In total, we yielded 2188 sets of Google Trends data which included 548 time series of 4 anosmia and ageusia search concepts over the study period for 137 regions. These data indicated that differences in search interest for terms relating to anosmia and ageusia, between regions, is associated with geographical trends in new Covid-19 cases.

Although various methods have been proposed, the performance of existing approaches drops dramatically when handling incomplete high-dimensional data (which is common in real world applications). To solve the problem, we propose a novel deep incomplete clustering method, named Deep Distribution-preserving Incomplete Clustering with Optimal Transport (DDIC-OT). To avoid insufficient sample utilization in existing methods limited by few fully-observed samples, we propose to measure distribution distance with the optimal transport for reconstruction evaluation instead of traditional pixel-wise loss function. Moreover, the clustering loss of the latent feature is introduced to regularize the embedding with more discrimination capability. As a consequence, the network becomes more robust against missing features and the unified framework which combines clustering and sample imputation enables the two procedures to negotiate to better serve for each other. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network achieves superior and stable clustering performance improvement against existing state-of-the-art incomplete clustering methods over different missing ratios.","Luo, Mingjie; Wang, Siwei; Liu, Xinwang; Tu, Wenxuan; Zhang, Yi; Guo, Xifeng; Zhou, Sihang; Zhu, En",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.11424v1.pdf,223

287821,A Mixed-Signal Chip-Based Configurable Coherent Photoacoustic-Radar Sensing Platform for In Vivo Temperature Monitoring and Vital Signs Detection,2021,"BACKGROUND: Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) is an essential tool for physicians to guide treatment decisions in both hospital and prehospital settings. Despite the potential patient care and system utilization benefits of prehospital ultrasound, the financial burden of a ""hands-on"" training program for large numbers of paramedics remains a barrier to implementation. In this study, we conducted a prospective, observational, double-blinded study comparing paramedics to emergency physicians in their ability to generate usable abdominal ultrasound images after a 1-hour didactic training session. METHODS: Canadian aeromedical critical care paramedics were compared against emergency medicine physicians in their ability to generate adequate abdominal ultrasound images on five healthy volunteers. Quality of each scan was evaluated by a trained expert in POCUS who was blinded to the identity of the participant using a 5-point Likert scale and using the standardized QUICk Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) assessment tool. RESULTS: Fourteen Critical care paramedics and four emergency department (ED) physicians were voluntarily recruited. Of paramedics, 57% had never used ultrasound before, 36% has used ultrasound without formal training, and 7% had previous training. Physicians had a higher proportion of usable scans compared with paramedics (100% v. 61.4%, &#916;38.6%; 95% confidence interval, 19.3-50.28). CONCLUSIONS: Paramedics were not able to produce images of interpretable quality at the same frequency when compared with emergency medicine physicians. However, a 61.4% usable image rate for paramedics following a short 1-hour didactic training session is promising for future studies, which could incorporate a short hands-on tutorial while remaining cost-effective.","Waterman, Bradley; Van Aarsen, Kristine; Lewell, Michael; Myslik, Frank; Peddle, Michael; Doran, Sean",CJEM,,223

Here, mid-infrared chiral plasmonic metasurfaces with high circular dichroism (CD) in absorption over 0.65 in the frequency range of 50 to 60 THz are demonstrated to strongly interact with the phonon vibrational resonance of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) molecules at 52 THz, under both left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized (LCP and RCP) light. The mode splitting features in the absorption spectra of the coupled metasurface-PMMA systems under both circular polarizations are studied in PMMA layers with different thicknesses. The relation between the mode splitting gap and the PMMA thickness is also revealed.

Each of these risk factors pathologically disrupts the lipidome, including immunomodulatory eicosanoid and docosanoid lipid mediators (LMs). We hypothesized that dysregulation of LMs may be a defining feature of the severity of COVID-19. By examining LMs and polyunsaturated fatty acid precursor lipids in serum from hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we demonstrate that moderate and severe disease are separated by specific differences in abundance of immune-regulatory and proinflammatory LMs. This difference in LM balance corresponded with decreased LM products of ALOX12 and COX2 and an increase LMs products of ALOX5 and cytochrome p450. Given the important immune-regulatory role of LMs, these data provide mechanistic insight into an immuno-lipidomic imbalance in severe COVID-19.","Schwarz, Benjamin; Sharma, Lokesh; Roberts, Lydia; Peng, Xiaohua; Bermejo, Santos; Leighton, Ian; Casanovas-Massana, Arnau; Minasyan, Maksym; Farhadian, Shelli; Ko, Albert I; Dela Cruz, Charles S; Bosio, Catharine M",,,223

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study in Mexico. METHODS: Adult pneumonia inpatients fulfilling suspected COVID-19 criteria, and hospital entry from March to August 2020, were enrolled. The Kaplan-Meier method was to use to compare survival estimates among patients with negative RT-qPCR nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs and those with a baseline positive test. RESULTS: Data from 64,624 individuals fulfilling suspected COVID-19 criteria were analyzed and 1.6% of them had negative RT-qPCR tests. The overall mortality rate was higher among laboratory-positive patients (48.5% vs. 34.2%, P < 0.001) and, at any given threshold, the survival estimates were higher among RT-qPCR-negative pneumonia inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19 remains poorly understood and suspected cases with pneumonia and negative laboratory results represent a major challenge for healthcare systems. Our findings suggest that RT-qPCR-negative inpatients may have an improved disease prognosis, but the in-hospital mortality was still high among them. However, further research is needed to clarify the clinical and epidemiological implications of our results.","Murillo-Zamora, E; Mendoza-Cano, O; Cárdenas-Rojas, M I; Hernandez-Suarez, C M; Guzmán-Esquivel, J",Public Health,,223

Low-income and minority students and families were particularly disadvantaged in accessing hardware and software technologies to support teaching and learning. Moreover, the homicide of George Floyd fostered a new wave of inquiry about racism and inequality, questioning often enabled with and through technology and social media. To address these issues, this article explores how parents and teachers experienced the pandemic through intersectional and digital divide-driven lenses. Data were collected from eight parents of underserved children and nine U.S. K-12 teachers to better understand challenges and best practices related to learning technologies during the pandemic. Data collection also focused on conversations about social justice, exploring specific needs and strategies for addressing technology inclusion and diversity in educational environments. Results from the study suggest that COVID-19 was a source of increased digital divide in terms of community and social support rather than economic means. At the same time, staying at home facilitated family discussions about racism and intersectionality-related themes. Implications are suggested for improving school communities and contexts in dealing with pandemic and emergency learning.","Gandolfi, Enrico Ferdig Richard E.; Kratcoski, Annette",Technology in Society,,223

RT-PCR based molecular test is recommended as the gold standard method for diagnosing current infections. However, transportation and processing of the clinical sample for detecting virus require an expert operator and long processing time. Testing device enables on-site virus detection could reduce the sample-to-answer time, which plays a central role in containing the pandemic. In this work, we proposed an intelligent face mask, where a flexible immunosensor based on high density conductive nanowire array, a miniaturized impedance circuit, and wireless communication units were embedded. The sub-100 nm size and the gap between the neighbored nanowires facilitate the locking of nanoscale virus particles by the nanowire arrays and greatly improve the detection efficiency. Such a point-of-care (POC) system was demonstrated for coronavirus 'spike' protein and whole virus aerosol detection in simulated human breath. Detection of viral concentration as low as 7 pfu/mL from the atomized sample of coronavirus aerosol mimic was achieved in only 5 min. The POC systems can be readily applied for preliminary screening of coronavirus infections on-site and may help to understand the COVID-19 progression while a patient is under prescribed therapy.","Xue, Qiannan; Kan, Xinyuan; Pan, Zhihao; Li, Zheyu; Pan, Wenwei; Zhou, Feng; Duan, Xuexin",Biosens Bioelectron,,223

The present study adapted the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) to the Spanish population, and 1094 Spanish adults (mean age 52.55 years, 241 males) completed the Spanish version in a cross-sectional online survey. To analyze the factorial structure and reliability of the CPDI, we performed an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) followed by a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the Spanish sample. The effects of gender and age on the degree of distress were analyzed using the factorial scores of the CPDI as the dependent variables. Results showed that, after rotation, the first factor (Stresssymptoms) accounted for 35% of the total variance and the second factor (COVID-19 information) for 15%. Around 25% (n = 279) of the participants experienced mild to moderate distress symptoms, 16% (n = 179) severe distress, and about 58% (n = 636) showed no distress symptoms. Women experienced more distress than men (p<0.01), and distress decreased with age (p<0.01). We conclude that the CPDI seems a promising screening tool for the rapid detection of potential peritraumatic stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jiménez, María Pilar; Rieker, Jennifer A; Reales, José Manuel; Ballesteros, Soledad",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,223

The injury of the portal vein matters because of the difficulty on the diagnosis and the approach surgery. Objective: To set the standard on the transverse section of the pancreas looking for a safer surgical access to repair the portal vein injuries. Methods: A quantitative analysis was performed to characterize the anatomical relationship between the portal vein and their tributaries relating them to the pancreas. On these corpses, the measurements of a anatomical triangle were studied. It base was the upper limit of the superior mesenteric vein and the initial portion of the portal vein; the apex, a point located on the upper limit of the confluence of the splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein, situated at the middle line of the superior mesenteric_ vein. Results: The portal vein is formed 3.24cm from the internal border of the duodenal arc at a distance of 1.61cm and 1.07 from the inferior and superior pancreas borders, respectively. Conclusion: The present study allow us to conclude that, to have access to the origin of the portal vein, in case of trauma of this vessel, one should proceed a transverse section of the neck of the pancreas next to the superior mesenteric vein, because its confluence with splenic vein occur, on average, 1.07cm and 1.61cm from the superior and inferior border of the gland, respectively.","Mantovani, Mario; Franco Leal, Raquel; José Fontelles, Mauro",Acta cir. bras.,,223
298913,Kenotic Theologies and the Challenge of the 'Anthropocene': From Deep Incarnation to Interspecies Encounter,2021,"In this perspective, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on tuberculosis (TB)/HIV health services and approaches to mitigating the growing burden of these three colliding epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). SSA countries bear significantly high proportions of TB and HIV cases reported worldwide, compared to countries in the West. Whilst COVID-19 epidemiology appears to vary across Africa, most countries in this region have reported relatively lower-case counts compared to the West. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic has added an additional burden to already overstretched health systems in SSA, which, among other things, have been focused on the longstanding dual epidemics of TB and HIV. As with these dual epidemics, inadequate resources and poor case identification and reporting may be contributing to underestimations of the COVID-19 case burden in SSA. Modelling studies predict that the pandemic-related disruptions in TB and HIV services will result in significant increases in associated morbidity and mortality over the next five years. Furthermore, limited empirical evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 coinfections with TB and HIV are associated with increased mortality risk in SSA. However, predictive models require a better evidence-base to accurately define the impact of COVID-19, not only on communicable diseases such as TB and HIV, but on non-communicable disease comorbidities. Further research is needed to assess morbidity and mortality data among both adults and children across the African continent, paying attention to geographic disparities, as well as the clinical and socio-economic determinants of COVID-19 in the setting of TB and/or HIV.","Nachega, Jean B; Kapata, Nathan; Sam-Agudu, Nadia A; Decloedt, Eric H; Katoto, Patrick D M C; Nagu, Tumaini; Mwaba, Peter; Yeboah-Manu, Dorothy; Chanda-Kapata, Pascalina; Ntoumi, Francine; Geng, Elvin H; Zumla, Alimuddin",Int. j. infect. dis,,223

The objective of this study is to investigate the short-term effect of risk-adapted treatment strategy on patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We collected the medical records of 55 COVID-19 patients for analysis. We divided these patients into mild, moderate and severe groups, and risk-adapted treatment approaches were given according to the illness severity. RESULTS: Twelve patients were in mild group and 22 were in moderate group (non-severe group, n=34), and 21 patients were in severe group. At the end of the first two weeks after admission, clinical manifestations had completely despeared in 31(91.2%)patients in non-severe group, and 18(85.7%) patients in severe group (p=0.85). Both groups had a satisfied chest CT imaging recovery, which includes 22(64.7%) patients in non-severe group and 12(57.1%) patients in severe group recovered at least 50% of the whole leisions in the first week, and 28(82.4%) and 16(76.2%) recovered at least 75% in the second week, respectively. There were no significant differences in SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity (p=0.92).

It is not hyperbole to state that COVID-19 has affected and infected almost everyone in society and the global community in different ways. However, many parts of the world seem to be improving. Individuals, organisations, and governments are trying to work through some effective strategies. The present study investigates the influence of fluctuation in the oil prices, COVID-19, and daily news-based index on Electronic Arts Inc's stock prices by applying a novel approach entitled Quantile Autoregressive Distributed Lag (QARDL) during 2019–2020. This approach is quite meaningful as it incorporates various quantiles with a comprehensive explanation of overall dependence among stated variables ignored by the traditional models like quantile regression, OLS, ARDL, etc. The study outcomes through QARDL reveal that the error correction coefficient is significant in various quantiles while confirming the long-run linkage among oil price, COVID-19, and EPU. More specifically, the study outcomes confirm a positive linkage (in all the quantiles) between COVID-19 and stock prices of Electronic Arts Inc, whereas a negative connection (for 0.20th to 0.95th quantiles) between oil prices and SPI. Furthermore, the Granger causality findings indicate the bidirectional causality between SPI and OIL and between SPI and EPU.

302442,A New Beginning in 2021,2021,"BACKGROUND: Influenza viruses are dangerous pathogens. Seventy-Seven genomes of recently emerged genotype 4 reassortant Eurasian avian-like H1N1 virus (G4-EA-H1N1) are currently available. We investigated the presence and variation of potential G-quadruplex forming sequences (PQS), which can serve as targets for antiviral treatment. RESULTS: PQS were identified in all 77 genomes. The total number of PQS in G4-EA-H1N1 genomes was 571. Interestingly, the number of PQS per genome in individual close relative viruses varied from 4 to 12. PQS were not randomly distributed in the 8 segments of the G4-EA-H1N1 genome, the highest frequency of PQS being found in the NP segment (1.39 per 1000 nt), which is considered a potential target for antiviral therapy. In contrast, no PQS was found in the NS segment. Analyses of variability pointed the importance of some PQS; even if genome variation of influenza virus is extreme, the PQS with the highest G4Hunter score is the most conserved in all tested genomes. G-quadruplex formation in vitro was experimentally confirmed using spectroscopic methods. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here hint several G-quadruplex-forming sequences in G4-EA-H1N1 genomes, that could provide good therapeutic targets.","Brázda, Václav; Porubiaková, Otília; Cantara, Alessio; Bohálová, Natália; Coufal, Jan; Bartas, Martin; Fojta, Miroslav; Mergny, Jean-Louis",BMC Genomics,,223

Exploring Variables Associated with Dog Confinement and General Characteristics of the Free-ranging Owned-Dog Population in a Peri-urban Area,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the factors that affect anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody production remain unclear. This study aimed to identify such factors among patients convalescing from COVID-19. METHODS: This study comprised patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1 and June 30, 2020 and gave consent for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody measurement using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay during their acute and/or convalescent phases. Factors related to elevated antibody titers and the relationship between the days from disease onset and the development of antibody titers were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 84 participants enrolled in the study. Nineteen participants had antibody titers measured during the convalescent phase only, and 65 participants had antibody titers measured during the acute and convalescent phases. The antibody titers peaked in weeks 5 and 6. The stepwise multivariate log-normal analysis revealed that male sex (P = 0.04), diabetes mellitus (P = 0.03), and high C-reactive protein levels during the disease course (P < 0.001) were associated with elevated IgG antibodies. Glucocorticoid use was not associated with antibody titers. CONCLUSION: The study found that high values of maximum CRP levels during the acute phase, male sex, and diabetes mellitus were associated with elevated antibody titers. Antibody titers tended to be highest in the first 5 or 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms.","Kutsuna, Satoshi; Asai, Yusuke; Matsunaga, Akihiro; Kinoshita, Noriko; Terada, Mari; Miyazato, Yusuke; Nakamoto, Takato; Suzuki, Tetsuya; Saito, Sho; Endo, Mio; Kanda, Kohei; Kenji, Maeda; Takasaki, Jin; Hojo, Masayuki; Ishizaka, Yukihito; Ohmagari, Norio",J. infect. chemother,,223

306203,Knowledge Base Completion: Baseline strikes back (Again),2020-05-02,"OBJECTIVES: To identify sex and age differences in clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety and the factors associated with these differences among adults in Australia during COVID-19-related restrictions. DESIGN: Anonymous online survey. SETTING: Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged over 18 years living in Australia were eligible and 13 829 contributed complete data. Of these, 13 762 identified as female (10 434) or male (3328) and were included in analyses. INTERVENTIONS: None. OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinically significant symptoms of depression (&#8805;10 on Patient Health Questionnaire 9) or anxiety (&#8805;10 on Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale 7 (GAD-7)), and experiences of irritability (GAD-7 item 6). RESULTS: Women were more likely than men to have clinically significant symptoms of depression (26.3% (95% CI 25.4 to 27.1) vs 20.1% (95% CI 18.7 to 21.5), p<0.001) and anxiety (21.8% (95% CI 21.0 to 22.6) vs 14.2% (95% CI 13.0 to 15.4), p<0.001) and to have experienced irritability in the previous fortnight (63.1% (95% CI 62.1 to 64.0) vs 51.4% (95% CI 49.7 to 53.2), p<0.001). They were also more likely than men to be doing unpaid work caring for children (22.8% (95% CI 22.0 to 23.6) vs 8.6% (95% CI 7.7 to 9.6), p<0.001) and dependent relatives (9.8% (95% CI 9.2 to 10.3) vs 5.7% (95% CI 4.9 to 6.5), p<0.001) which made significant contributions to the mental health outcomes of interest. Loss of employment, fear of contracting COVID-19 and feeling a severe impact of the restrictions were associated with poorer mental health in women and men of all ages. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety were higher among women than men. Rather than being intrinsically more vulnerable to mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, the higher risk of symptoms of anxiety and depression among women may in part be explained by their disproportionate burden of unpaid caregiving.","Hammarberg, Karin; Tran, Thach; Kirkman, Maggie; Fisher, Jane",BMJ Open,,223

309920,An integrated autoencoder-based hybrid CNN-LSTM model for COVID-19 severity prediction from lung ultrasound,2021,"Natural and non-natural factors have combined effects on the trajectory of COVID-19 pandemic, but it is difficult to make them separate. To address this problem, a two-stepped methodology is proposed. First, a compound natural factor (CNF) model is developed via assigning weight to each of seven investigated natural factors, that is temperature, humidity, visibility, wind speed, barometric pressure, aerosol, and vegetation in order to show their coupling relationship with the COVID-19 trajectory. Onward, the empirical distribution based framework (EDBF) is employed to iteratively optimize the coupling relationship between trajectory and CNF to express the real interaction. In addition, the collected data is considered from the backdate, that is about 23 days-which contains 14-days incubation period and 9-days invalid human response time-due to the nonavailability of prior information about the natural spreading of virus without any human intervention(s), and also lag effects of the weather change and social interventions on the observed trajectory due to the COVID-19 incubation period;Second, the optimized CNF-plus-polynomial model is used to predict the future trajectory of COVID-19. Results revealed that aerosol and visibility show the higher contribution to transmission, wind speed to death, and humidity followed by barometric pressure dominate the recovery rates, respectively. Consequently, the average effect of environmental change to COVID-19 trajectory in China is minor in all variables, that is about -0.3%, +0.3%, and +0.1%, respectively. In this research, the response analysis of COVID-19 trajectory to the compound natural interactions presents a new prospect on the part of global pandemic trajectory to environmental changes.","Zuo, Z.

310042,"Lethal and Teratogenic Impacts of Imazapyr, Diquat Dibromide, and Glufosinate Ammonium Herbicide Formulations Using Frog Embryo Teratogenesis Assay-Xenopus (FETAX)",2020,"Among the many aspects that characterize the COVID-19 pandemic, two seem particularly challenging to understand: i) the great geographical differences in the degree of virus contagiousness and lethality that were found in the different phases of the epidemic progression, and, ii) the potential role of the infected people's blood type in both the virus infectivity and the progression of the disease. A recent hypothesis could shed some light on both aspects. Specifically, it has been proposed that, in the subject-to-subject transfer, SARS-CoV-2 conserves on its capsid the erythrocytes' antigens of the source subject. Thus these conserved antigens can potentially cause an immune reaction in a receiving subject that has previously acquired specific antibodies for the source subject antigens. This hypothesis implies a blood type-dependent infection rate. The strong geographical dependence of the blood type distribution could be, therefore, one of the factors at the origin of the observed heterogeneity in the epidemics spread. Here, we present an epidemiological deterministic model where the infection rules based on blood types are taken into account, and we compare our model outcomes with the exiting worldwide infection progression data. We found an overall good agreement, which strengthens the hypothesis that blood types do play a role in the COVID-19 infection.","Miotto, Mattia; Di Rienzo, Lorenzo; Gosti, Giorgio; Milanetti, Edoardo; Ruocco, Giancarlo",PLoS One,,223

313879,India speeds up vaccinations as cases soar again,2021,"BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that women admitted for delivery should have universal PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, the considerable difference in the incidence of COVID-19 between different geographic regions may affect screening strategies. Therefore, we aimed to compare questionnaire-based testing versus universal PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in women admitted for delivery. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of women admitted for delivery at a single center during a four-week period (April 22-May 25, 2020). All women completed a questionnaire about COVID-19 signs, symptoms, or risk factors, and a nasopharyngeal swab for PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Women who were flagged as suspected COVID-19 by the questionnaire (questionnaire-positive) were compared with women who were not flagged by the questionnaire (questionnaire-negative). RESULTS: Overall, 446 women were eligible for analysis, of which 54 (12.1%) were questionnaire-positive. PCR swab detected SARS-CoV-2 in four (0.9%) women: 3 of 392 (0.8%) in the questionnaire-negative group, and 1 of 54 (1.9%) in the questionnaire-positive group (P = .43), yielding a number needed to screen of 92 (95% CI 62-177). In 96% of the cases, the PCR results were obtained only in the postpartum period. No positive PCR results were obtained from neonatal testing for SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivity of the questionnaire was 75.0%, and the negative predictive value was 99.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Although the rate of positive PCR results was not significantly different between the groups, the number needed to screen is considerably high. The use of questionnaire-based PCR testing in areas with low incidence of COVID-19 allows for a reasonable allocation of resources and is easy to implement.","Mei-Dan, Elad; Satkunaratnam, Abheha; Cahan, Tal; Leung, Marian; Katz, Kevin; Aviram, Amir",Birth,,223

316662,Anticipating trajectories of exponential growth,2021,"BACKGROUND: The magnitude and time course of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States depends on early interventions to reduce the basic reproductive number to below 1. It is imperative, then, to develop methods to actively assess where quarantine measures such as social distancing may be deficient and suppress those potential resurgence nodes as early as possible. OBJECTIVE: We ask if social media is an early indicator of public social distancing measures in the United States by investigating its correlation with the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) as compared to social mobility estimates reported from Google and Apple Maps. METHODS: In this observational study, the estimated Rt was obtained for the period between March 5 and April 5, 2020, using the EpiEstim package. Social media activity was assessed using queries of ""social distancing"" or ""#socialdistancing"" on Google Trends, Instagram, and Twitter, with social mobility assessed using Apple and Google Maps data. Cross-correlations were performed between Rt and social media activity or mobility for the United States. We used Pearson correlations and the coefficient of determination (&#961;) with significance set to P<.05. RESULTS: Negative correlations were found between Google search interest for ""social distancing"" and Rt in the United States (P<.001), and between search interest and state-specific Rt for 9 states with the highest COVID-19 cases (P<.001); most states experienced a delay varying between 3-8 days before reaching significance. A negative correlation was seen at a 4-day delay from the start of the Instagram hashtag ""#socialdistancing"" and at 6 days for Twitter (P<.001). Significant correlations between Rt and social media manifest earlier in time compared to social mobility measures from Google and Apple Maps, with peaks at -6 and -4 days. Meanwhile, changes in social mobility correlated best with Rt at -2 days and +1 day for workplace and grocery/pharmacy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the potential use of Google Trends, Instagram, and Twitter as epidemiological tools in the assessment of social distancing measures in the United States during the early course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Their correlation and earlier rise and peak in correlative strength with Rt when compared to social mobility may provide proactive insight into whether social distancing efforts are sufficiently enacted. Whether this proves valuable in the creation of more accurate assessments of the early epidemic course is uncertain due to limitations. These limitations include the use of a biased sample that is internet literate with internet access, which may covary with socioeconomic status, education, geography, and age, and the use of subtotal social media mentions of social distancing. Future studies should focus on investigating how social media reactions change during the course of the epidemic, as well as the conversion of social media behavior to actual physical behavior.","Younis, Joseph; Freitag, Harvy; Ruthberg, Jeremy S; Romanes, Jonathan P; Nielsen, Craig; Mehta, Neil",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,223

The present study aimed to analyse the relationship between perceived mattering to family and friends, metastereotypes, and well-being among two minority groups: people living with HIV (PLWHA) and people with disabilities (PWDs). Of 100 participants, 39 were living with HIV and 61 were individuals with disabilities. Multiple regression analyses showed that positive (more than negative) metastereotypes could significantly predict perceived mattering and well-being among both groups. Mattering to both family and friends significantly predicted many dimensions of well-being among both PLWHA and PWDs. These findings show that perception of mattering is related to the well-being of minority group members. Interventions aimed at improving the well-being of individuals who belong to minority groups should focus on positive metastereotypes and the perception of being important to significant others, considering both friends and family members.","Matera, Camilla; Meringolo, Patrizia; Reino, Mattia",Psychol Health Med,,223

Main areas of study with consistent scientific outcomes are the topical treatment of both disk herniation and periodontal disease. On the other hand, there is a net dissociation of the scientific resonance concerning systemic oxygen/ozone treatments. It is our intention to discuss in logical terms the numerous papers that commendably reported adverse reactions attributable to OT, focusing our attention mainly to the techniques of administration and not to the simple contact of ozone with biological material. The case reports on OT treatments safety concerns discussed on international journals, make it possible to state that most safety issues are secondary to infections or traumatic reactions due to malpractice. Commonly, the molecule of ozone itself is not responsible of severe reactions at the therapeutic modalities. The millions of patients treated so far from the thousands of physicians correctly practicing OT world widely in the last 40 years demonstrate the safety of this simple and cost-effective regenerative medicine tool. The promising therapeutic implications also for the current COVID-19 emergency are a further stimulus to the standardization of this therapeutic resource with multiple application specificities.","Re, L; Noci, J B; Gadelha Serra, M E; Mollica, P; Bonetti, M; Travagli, V",J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,,223
317807,Visual Companion for Booklovers,2020-10-31,"Ivermectin (IVM) belongs to the class of macrocyclic lactones, which is used as an antiparasitic agent. At present, the researchers focus on possibility to use IVM in treatment of certain forms of cancer and viral diseases such as COVID-19. The mechanisms of IVM action are not clear. It is assumed that IVM affects chloride channels and increases cytoplasmic concentration of chloride. This study examines the effect of IVM on chloride currents induced by glycine (IGly). Experiments were carried out on isolated pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus with whole-cell patch clamp. A short-term (600 msec) application of IVM in a concentration of 10 µM induced a slow inward current, which persisted after washing the neurons. The low concentrations (0.1-1000 nM) of IVM did not induce any novel current, but it rapidly and reversibly reduced the peak amplitude and accelerated desensitization of IGly in a dose-dependent manner. The threshold concentrations of IVM sufficient to reduce peak amplitude of IGly and to accelerate desensitization of IGly were 100 nM and 0.1 nM, respectively. The study revealed a high sensitivity of neuronal glycine receptors to IVM.","Bukanova, J V; Solntseva, E I; Kondratenko, R V; Skrebitsky, V G",Bull Exp Biol Med,,223
317940,EC announces actions to increase security and sustainability of Europe's raw materials supply,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed an enormous burden on health care systems around the world. In the past, the administration of convalescent plasma of patients having recovered from SARS and severe influenza to patients actively having the disease showed promising effects on mortality and appeared safe. Whether or not this also holds true for the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently unknown. METHODS: DAWn-Plasma is a multicentre nation-wide, randomized, open-label, phase II proof-of-concept clinical trial, evaluating the clinical efficacy and safety of the addition of convalescent plasma to the standard of care in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Belgium. Patients hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 are eligible when they are symptomatic (i.e. clinical or radiological signs) and have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the 72 h before study inclusion through a PCR (nasal/nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage) or a chest-CT scan showing features compatible with COVID-19 in the absence of an alternative diagnosis. Patients are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either standard of care and convalescent plasma (active treatment group) or standard of care only. The active treatment group receives 2 units of 200 to 250 mL of convalescent plasma within 12 h after randomization, with a second administration of 2 units 24 to 36 h after ending the first administration. The trial aims to include 483 patients and will recruit from 25 centres across Belgium. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients that require mechanical ventilation or have died at day 15. The main secondary endpoints are clinical status on day 15 and day 30 after randomization, as defined by the WHO Progression 10-point ordinal scale, and safety of the administration of convalescent plasma. DISCUSSION: This trial will either provide support or discourage the use of convalescent plasma as an early intervention for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection.

However, the extent and nature of changes in health care utilization during the pandemic may differ by care setting. Knowledge of the impact of the pandemic on health care utilization is important to health care organizations and policy makers. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are (1) to evaluate changes in in-person health care utilization and telehealth visits during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) to assess the difference in changes in health care utilization between the pandemic year 2020 and the prepandemic year 2019. METHODS: We retrospectively assembled a cohort consisting of members of a large integrated health care organization, who were enrolled between January 6 and November 2, 2019 (prepandemic year), and between January 5 and October 31, 2020 (pandemic year). The rates of visits were calculated weekly for four settings: inpatient, emergency department (ED), outpatient, and telehealth. Using Poisson models, we assessed the impact of the pandemic on health care utilization during the early days of the pandemic and conducted difference-in-deference (DID) analyses to measure the changes in health care utilization, adjusting for the trend of health care utilization in the prepandemic year. RESULTS: In the early days of the pandemic, we observed significant reductions in inpatient, ED, and outpatient utilization (by 30.2%, 37.0%, and 80.9%, respectively). By contrast, there was a 4-fold increase in telehealth visits between weeks 8 (February 23) and 12 (March 22) in 2020. DID analyses revealed that after adjusting for prepandemic secular trends, the reductions in inpatient, ED, and outpatient visit rates in the early days of the pandemic were 1.6, 8.9, and 367.2 visits per 100 person-years (P<.001), respectively, while the increase in telehealth visits was 272.9 visits per 100 person-years (P<.001). Further analyses suggested that the increase in telehealth visits offset the reduction in outpatient visits by week 26 (June 28, 2020). CONCLUSIONS: In-person health care utilization decreased drastically during the early period of the pandemic, but there was a corresponding increase in telehealth visits during the same period. By end-June 2020, the combined outpatient and telehealth visits had recovered to prepandemic levels.","Xu, Stanley; Glenn, Sungching; Sy, Lina; Qian, Lei; Hong, Vennis; Ryan, Denison S; Jacobsen, Steven",J Med Internet Res,,223

322394,Epidemics with containment measures,2020-04-08,"The D614G variant of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein emerged in early 2020 and quickly became the dominant circulating strain in Europe and its environs. The variant was characterized by the higher viral load, which is not associated with disease severity, higher incorporation into the virion, and high cell entry via ACE-2 and TMPRSS2. Previous strains of the coronavirus and the current SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated the selection of mutations as a mechanism of escaping immune responses. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA binding energy analysis to provide insights into the behaviour of the D614G S-protein at the molecular level and describe the neutralization mechanism of this variant. Our results show that the D614G S-protein adopts distinct conformational dynamics which is skewed towards the open-state conformation more than the closed-state conformation of the wild-type S-protein. Residue-specific variation of amino acid flexibility and domain-specific RMSD suggest that the mutation causes an allosteric conformational change in the RBD. Evaluation of the interaction energies between the S-protein and neutralizing antibodies show that the mutation may enhance, reduce or not affect the neutralizing interactions depending on the neutralizing antibody, especially if it targets the RBD. The results of this study have shed insights into the behaviour of the D614G S-protein at the molecular level and provided a glimpse of the neutralization mechanism of this variant.","Kwarteng, Alexander; Asiedu, Ebenezer; Sylverken, Augustina Angelina; Larbi, Amma; Sakyi, Samuel Asamoah; Asiedu, Samuel Opoku",Infect Genet Evol,,223

We analyzed 184 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Livingston, New Jersey for clinical characteristics associated with severe disease. The majority of patients with COVID-19 had diabetes mellitus (DM) (62.0%), Pre-DM (23.9%) with elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), or a body mass index >30 with normal hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) (4.3%). SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with new and persistent hyperglycemia in 29 patients, including several with normal HbA1C levels. Forty-four patients required intubation, which occurred significantly more often in patients with DM as compared with non-diabetics. Severe COVID-19 occurs in the presence of impaired glucose metabolism in patients, including those with DM, preDM, and obesity. COVID-19 is associated with elevated FBG and several patients presented with new onset DM or in DKA.

The number of cases soared in early February 2020, and Singapore declared escalation of the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange. Multiple measures have been taken to combat the spread of this highly contagious infection. Despite our medical manpower being diverted to the wards, our hospital aims to maintain nearly full operations at the clinic, balancing against concern about the spread of the virus and exposing healthcare workers to potential risks.

330500,Fine-tuning Encoders for Improved Monolingual and Zero-shot Polylingual Neural Topic Modeling,2021-04-11,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the more routine public health measures, many countries have implemented ""lockdowns""-closing borders, restricting international travel, and placing severe limitations on individual movement and group gatherings. While lockdowns may be an important tool to limit transmission, they come at a potentially great cost with regard to economic impact, mental health consequences, and increased morbidity and mortality from non-COVID-19 diseases. Furthermore, implementation of the required draconian measures may be difficult in some settings because of logistical, economic, and sociocultural impediments, especially in many low- and middle-income countries. Governments and health authorities must chart a course on how to ""unlock"" or control transmission where lockdowns are not feasible. ""Precision physical distancing""-distancing tailored and optimized to specific physical, social, cultural, political, and economic contexts and to specific groups and settings-is proposed and discussed here as an important tool in the control of COVID-19. It has the advantages of being low cost, adaptable to diverse sociocultural and economic settings through community ownership and local action, and more easily monitored and potentially enforced than less precise measures. Precision physical distancing can be one important component of a sustainable long-term solution that is proportionate to the risk yet does not have a disproportionate impact on society and the economy, allowing a partial return to normal activities, with the community as an essential partner.","Bausch, Daniel G",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,223

A common presentation of both COVID-19 and MIS-C is acute abdominal pain, sometimes mimicking appendicitis. We report two cases of patients initially diagnosed with appendicitis who either presented with or developed signs of shock and were found to have MIS-C. An 8-year-old girl who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) presented with fever, abdominal pain, and shock with ultrasound findings consistent with acute appendicitis. After being treated for MIS-C, she underwent appendectomy and improved. Final pathology was consistent with acute appendicitis. A 9-year-old girl who tested negative for COVID RT-PCR presented with uncomplicated appendicitis and underwent laparoscopic appendectomy, but developed post-operative fever and shock. Antibody testing was positive and she responded to treatment for MIS-C. Histology showed lymphohistiocytic inflammation within the muscularis propria, mesoappendix and serosa without the typical neutrophil-rich inflammation and mucosal involvement of acute appendicitis. The diagnosis was MIS-C, not appendicitis. Given the new reality of the COVID-19 pandemic, pediatric surgeons must be aware of MIS-C as a possible diagnosis and should understand the diagnostic criteria and current treatment guidelines.","Anderson, Jamie E.; Campbell, Julie A.; Durowoju, Lindsey Greenberg Sarah L.

This particularly matters now that the COVID-19 epidemic is putting health systems under stress. Brazil is one of the world's most affected countries, and its health system was already experiencing the aftermath of the 2015 recession. METHODS: Between 2018 and 2019 we conducted 46 semi-structured interviews with health practitioners, managers and policy-makers to explore the impact of the 2015 recession on public and private providers in prosperous (São Paulo) and impoverished (Maranhão) states in Brazil. Thematic analysis was employed to identify drivers and consequences of system adaptation and coping strategies. Nvivo software was used to aid data collection and analysis. We followed the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research to provide an account of the findings. RESULTS: We found the concept of 'health sector crisis' to be politically charged among healthcare providers in São Paulo and Maranhão. Contrary to expectations, the public sector was reported to have found ways to compensate for diminishing federal funding, having outsourced services and adopted flexible-if insecure-working arrangements. Following a drop in employment and health plans, private health insurance companies have streamlined their offer, at times at the expenses of coverage. Low-cost walk-in clinics were hit hard by the recession, but were also credited for having moved to cater for higher-income customers in Maranhão. CONCLUSIONS: The 'plates' of a health system may shift and adjust in unexpected ways in response to recessions, and some of these changes might outlast the crisis. As low-income countries enter post-COVID economic recessions, it will be important to monitor the adjustments taking place in health systems, to ensure that past gains in access to care and job security are not eroded.","Russo, Giuliano; Levi, Maria Luiza; Seabra Soares de Britto E Alves, Maria Teresa; Carneiro Alves de Oliveira, Bruno Luciano; de Souza Britto Ferreira de Carvalho, Ruth Helena; Andrietta, Lucas Salvador; Filippon, Jonathan Gonçalves; Scheffer, Mário César",PLoS One,,223
334955,Financial Strategies for Difficult Times,2020,"BackgroundInvasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies hypothesized that this was due to reduced pneumococcal transmission resulting from non-pharmacological interventions. We used multiple ongoing cohort surveillance projects in children <5 years to test this hypothesis. MethodsThe first SARS-CoV-2 cases were detected in February-2020, resulting in a full lockdown, followed by several partial restrictions. Data from ongoing surveillance projects captured the incidence dynamics of community-acquired alveolar pneumonia (CAAP), non-alveolar lower respiratory infections necessitating chest X-rays (NA-LRI), nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage in non-respiratory visits, nasopharyngeal respiratory virus detection (by PCR), and nationwide invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Monthly rates (January-2020 through February-2021 vs. mean monthly rates 2016-2019 [expected rates]) adjusted for age and ethnicity, were compared. FindingsCAAP and bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia were strongly reduced (incidence rate ratios, [IRRs] 0{eta}07 and 0{eta}19, respectively); NA-LRI and non-pneumonia IPD were also reduced, with a lesser magnitude (IRRs, 0{eta}46 and 0{eta}42, respectively). In contrast, pneumococcal carriage prevalence was only slightly reduced and density of colonization and pneumococcal serotype distributions were similar to previous years. The pneumococcus-associated disease decline was temporally associated with a full suppression of RSV, influenza viruses, and hMPV, often implicated as co-pathogens with pneumococcus. In contrast, adenovirus, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza activities were within or above expected levels. InterpretationReductions in pneumococcal and pneumococcus-associated diseases occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic were not predominantly related to reduced pneumococcal transmission and carriage but were strongly associated with the complete disappearance of specific respiratory viruses.

335732,A Logic of Expertise,2021-07-22,"INTRODUCTION: Barrier enclosure devices were introduced to protect against infectious disease transmission during aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMP). Recent discussion in the medical community has led to new designs and adoption despite limited evidence. A scoping review was conducted to characterize devices being used and their performance. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of formal databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, Scopus), grey literature, and hand-searched relevant journals. Forward and reverse citation searching was completed on included articles. Article/full-text screening and data extraction was performed by two independent reviewers. Studies were categorized by publication type, device category, intended medical use, and outcomes (efficacy - ability to contain particles; efficiency - time to complete AGMP; and usability - user experience). RESULTS: Searches identified 6489 studies and 123 met criteria for inclusion (k = 0.81 title/abstract, k = 0.77 full-text). Most articles were published in 2020 (98%, n = 120) as letters/commentaries (58%, n = 71). Box systems represented 42% (n = 52) of systems described, while plastic sheet systems accounted for 54% (n = 66). The majority were used for airway management (67%, n = 83). Only half of articles described outcome measures (54%, n = 67); 82% (n = 55) reporting efficacy, 39% (n = 26) on usability, and 15% (n = 10) on efficiency. Efficacy of devices in containing aerosols was limited and frequently dependent on use of suction devices. CONCLUSIONS: While use of various barrier enclosure devices has become widespread during this pandemic, objective data of efficacy, efficiency, and usability is limited. Further controlled studies are required before adoption into routine clinical practice.","Price, Courtney; Ben-Yakov, Maxim; Choi, Joseph; Orchanian-Cheff, Ani; Tawadrous, Davy",Am. j. emerg. med,,223

Here, we determine the three-dimensional structure of AEG12 and describe the binding specificity of acyl-chain ligands within its large central hydrophobic cavity. We show that AEG12 displays hemolytic and cytolytic activity by selectively delivering unsaturated fatty acid cargoes into phosphatidylcholine-rich lipid bilayers. This property of AEG12 also enables it to inhibit replication of enveloped viruses such as Dengue and Zika viruses at low micromolar concentrations. Weaker inhibition was observed against more distantly related coronaviruses and lentivirus, while no inhibition was observed against the nonenveloped virus adeno-associated virus. Together, our results uncover the mechanistic understanding of AEG12 function and provide the necessary implications for its use as a broad-spectrum therapeutic against cellular and viral targets.","Foo, Alexander C Y; Thompson, Peter M; Chen, Shih-Heng; Jadi, Ramesh; Lupo, Brianna; DeRose, Eugene F; Arora, Simrat; Placentra, Victoria C; Premkumar, Lakshmanane; Perera, Lalith; Pedersen, Lars C; Martin, Negin; Mueller, Geoffrey A",Proc.

Because of these restrictions, in-person contact with friends, family, and mental health supports had been limited, potentially impacting mental wellbeing. Objectives In this study, we examined the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of adults and investigated the types of activities people engage in to manage and maintain their mental health. Methods An online survey was circulated in Canada and had a total of 221 participants from September 24 to December 8, 2020. Results The majority of participants were females (73.2%), between the ages of 18 and 34 (51.1%), and employed full-time (56.1%). Individuals who are unemployed and those with an annual income less than $25,000 had the highest scores in depression, anxiety and psychological distress. Around 19.4% of the sample scored above the cutpoint for depression, which is higher compared to a pre-pandemic population prevalence of 4.7%. Similarly, higher prevalence of anxiety and distress symptoms were observed: 16.3% of the sample had moderate anxiety symptoms compared to a pre-pandemic population prevalence of 11.6%;and 37.7% of the sample had moderate distress symptoms compared to a pre-pandemic population prevalence of 20%. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the mental health of many adults and that individuals engage in a wide range of activities that may maintain and promote mental wellness during the pandemic, such as exercising, reading, and listening to music.","Gupta, Aanchel Puyat Joseph H.; Ranote, Harmanpreet Vila-Rodriguez Fidel Kazanjian Arminee",Journal of Affective Disorders Reports,,223
340436,Global solutions to prevent a pandemic,2020,"(1) Background: Several smaller studies have shown that COVID-19 patients with cancer are at a significantly higher risk of death. Our objective was to compare patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with cancer to those without cancer using national data and to study the effect of cancer on the risk of hospital death and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. (2) Methods: All patients hospitalized in France for COVID-19 in March-April 2020 were included from the French national administrative database, which contains discharge summaries for all hospital admissions in France. Cancer patients were identified within this population. The effect of cancer was estimated with logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities. (3) Results: Among the 89,530 COVID-19 patients, we identified 6201 cancer patients (6.9%). These patients were older and were more likely to be men and to have complications (acute respiratory and kidney failure, venous thrombosis, atrial fibrillation) than those without cancer. In patients with hematological cancer, admission to ICU was significantly more frequent (24.8%) than patients without cancer (16.4%) (p < 0.01). Solid cancer patients without metastasis had a significantly higher mortality risk than patients without cancer (aOR = 1.4 [1.3-1.5]), and the difference was even more marked for metastatic solid cancer patients (aOR = 3.6 [3.2-4.0]). Compared to patients with colorectal cancer, patients with lung cancer, digestive cancer (excluding colorectal cancer) and hematological cancer had a higher mortality risk (aOR = 2.0 [1.6-2.6], 1.6 [1.3-2.1] and 1.4 [1.1-1.8], respectively). (4) Conclusions: This study shows that, in France, patients with COVID-19 and cancer have a two-fold risk of death when compared to COVID-19 patients without cancer. We suggest the need to reorganize facilities to prevent the contamination of patients being treated for cancer, similar to what is already being done in some countries.","Bernard, Alain; Cottenet, Jonathan; Bonniaud, Philippe; Piroth, Lionel; Arveux, Patrick; Tubert-Bitter, Pascale; Quantin, Catherine",,,223

We aimed to establish whether health outcomes and care differed between patients with schizophrenia and patients without a diagnosis of severe mental illness. We conducted a population-based cohort study of all patients with identified COVID-19 and respiratory symptoms who were hospitalized in France between February and June 2020. Cases were patients who had a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Controls were patients who did not have a diagnosis of severe mental illness. The outcomes were in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. A total of 50,750 patients were included, of whom 823 were schizophrenia patients (1.6%). The schizophrenia patients had an increased in-hospital mortality (25.6% vs. 21.7%; adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.30 [95% CI 1.08-1.56], p = 0.0093) and a decreased ICU admission rate (23.7% vs. 28.4%; aOR 0.75 [95% CI 0.62-0.91], p = 0.0062) compared to controls. Significant interactions between schizophrenia and age for mortality and ICU admission were observed (p = 0.0006 and p < 0.0001). Schizophrenia patients between 65 and 80 years had a significantly higher risk of death than controls of the same age (+7.89%). schizophrenia patients younger than 55 years had more ICU admissions (+13.93%) and schizophrenia patients between 65 and 80 years and older than 80 years had less ICU admissions than controls of the same age (-15.44% and -5.93%, respectively). Our findings report the existence of disparities in health and health care between schizophrenia patients and patients without a diagnosis of severe mental illness. These disparities differed according to the age and clinical profile of schizophrenia patients, suggesting the importance of personalized COVID-19 clinical management and health care strategies before, during and after hospitalization for reducing health disparities in this vulnerable population.","Fond, Guillaume; Llorca, Pierre-Michel; Lançon, Christophe; Auquier, Pascal; Boyer, Laurent",Ann. med.-psychol,,223

Especially now, in the midst of the COVID-19 epidemic and increased awareness of racial inequity, students (and teachers) will need interventions appropriate for trauma and grief. For school-based counselors, sandtray counseling is a developmentally appropriate intervention, particularly for preadolescents, who are old enough to feel uncomfortable with playroom toys and yet are not developmentally ready to use a primarily verbal intervention. Sandtray counseling can provide a culturally sensitive, safe, and soothing bridge between experience and expression, to facilitate integration and healing. With proper training, sandtray counseling can be a valuable addition to any practitioners’ toolbox and is effectively conducted by practitioners working from various theoretical orientations.

342063,Mean Field Analysis of Hypergraph Contagion Model,2021-08-11,"OBJECTIVE: To measure COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and related factors to undercover nurses' concerns and fears. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SAMPLE: The study included 639 nurses; 83% were women and 80% under 50 years. MEASUREMENT: A self-administered questionnaire was used. It included demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related fears and concerns, COVID-19 vaccine perceived benefits, and intention toward getting the vaccine. RESULTS: Forty percent of the nurses planned to get the vaccine when available, 41% would take it later when adequate protection and safety were presented, and 18% would never take it. Significant factors associated with vaccination intention were as follows: age (adjusted OR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.02-1.99); lack of knowledge about the vaccine (adjusted OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.81-3.8); concern about long-term side effects (adjusted OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4-2.9); fear of injection (adjusted OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.04-2.13); natural immunity preference (adjusted OR 5.8, 95% CI 4.5-8.3); media misrepresentation (adjusted OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.4); and getting COVID-19 from the vaccine (adjusted OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccine safety and side-effects concerns impact nurses' intentions to accept the vaccine and may result in low acceptance rates. Urgent action is needed to address these fears and raise confidence, as nurses' vaccine-related decisions can affect the public's vaccine acceptance.","Rabi, Razan; Maraqa, Beesan; Nazzal, Zaher; Zink, Therese",Public health nurs,,223
342831,Editor's Note,2021,"BACKGROUND: Facing the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), most vulnerable individuals are seniors, especially those with comorbidities. More attention needs to been paid to the COVID-19 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the top age-related neurodegenerative disease. OBJECTIVE: Since it is unclear whether AD patients are prone to COVID-19 infection and progression to severe stages, we report for the first time a retrospective analysis of the clinical characteristics of AD patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of the clinical data of 19 AD patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, compared with 23 non-AD COVID-19 patients admitted at the same time to our hospital. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Between AD patients and non-AD patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, the pneumonia severity was not significantly different. AD patients had a higher clustering onset than non-AD patients. The median duration from symptom onset to hospitalization were shorter in AD patients than non-AD patients, indicating the former were sent to the hospital by their family or from nursing home earlier than the later. The median duration from hospitalization to discharge seemed shorter in AD patients than non-AD patients. Dementia patients seemed less likely to report fatigue. It is noticed that more AD patients might have pericardial effusion than the non-AD patients. CONCLUSION: AD patients with COVID-19 were in milder conditions with a better prognosis than non-AD patients. AD patients who had adequate access to healthcare showed resilience to COVID-19 with shorter hospital stays.","Li, Jingwen; Long, Xi; Huang, Heqing; Tang, Jine; Zhu, Chunli; Hu, Shaoping; Wu, Jing; Li, Jinghong; Lin, Zhicheng; Xiong, Nian",J Alzheimers Dis,,223

Early concerns regarding demand far exceeding capacity were balanced by anecdotal reports of decreased patient visits, including those for specific high-acuity conditions. This study sought to identify changes in ED volume and acuity, within a specific managed care environment, associated with the onset of the pandemic. METHODS: Data from patient visits to 2 San Diego, California, EDs-within an integrated health-care system-were extracted from the electronic health record. Daily patient visits, hospital admissions from the ED, Emergency Severity Index scores, and mode of arrival were compared between two 28-day periods, with the 28 days following a ""stay at home"" order issued by the governor of California and a control period of the same dates in 2019. RESULTS: These EDs observed a significant decrease in daily visits (42% compared to the previous year) associated with the pandemic. An increased rate of hospital admissions (16.6%-21.6%) was suggestive of an overall increase in acuity; however, changes in the distribution of Emergency Severity Index scores were less pronounced. The overall number of admissions declined significantly. Although overall ambulance traffic decreased, the proportion of patients arriving by ambulance was unchanged. CONCLUSION: Patient volume in 2 EDs dropped significantly in association with a statewide response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There was also a shift in acuity as measured by the proportion of patients admitted to the hospital, but overall admissions declined, suggesting sicker patients also did not seek care.","Lorenzen, Brent; Schwartz, Adam",Perm. j.

345237,A proxemics game between festival visitors and an industrial robot,2021-05-28,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is associated with a prothrombotic state leading to adverse clinical outcomes. Whether therapeutic anticoagulation improves outcomes in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 is unknown. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of therapeutic versus prophylactic anticoagulation in this population. METHODS: We did a pragmatic, open-label (with blinded adjudication), multicentre, randomised, controlled trial, at 31 sites in Brazil. Patients (aged &#8805;18 years) hospitalised with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer concentration, and who had COVID-19 symptoms for up to 14 days before randomisation, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulation. Therapeutic anticoagulation was in-hospital oral rivaroxaban (20 mg or 15 mg daily) for stable patients, or initial subcutaneous enoxaparin (1 mg/kg twice per day) or intravenous unfractionated heparin (to achieve a 0·3-0·7 IU/mL anti-Xa concentration) for clinically unstable patients, followed by rivaroxaban to day 30. Prophylactic anticoagulation was standard in-hospital enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin. The primary efficacy outcome was a hierarchical analysis of time to death, duration of hospitalisation, or duration of supplemental oxygen to day 30, analysed with the win ratio method (a ratio >1 reflects a better outcome in the therapeutic anticoagulation group) in the intention-to-treat population. The primary safety outcome was major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding through 30 days. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04394377) and is completed. FINDINGS: From June 24, 2020, to Feb 26, 2021, 3331 patients were screened and 615 were randomly allocated (311 [50%] to the therapeutic anticoagulation group and 304 [50%] to the prophylactic anticoagulation group). 576 (94%) were clinically stable and 39 (6%) clinically unstable. One patient, in the therapeutic group, was lost to follow-up because of withdrawal of consent and was not included in the primary analysis. The primary efficacy outcome was not different between patients assigned therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulation, with 28â899 (34·8%) wins in the therapeutic group and 34â288 (41·3%) in the prophylactic group (win ratio 0·86 [95% CI 0·59-1·22], p=0·40). Consistent results were seen in clinically stable and clinically unstable patients. The primary safety outcome of major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding occurred in 26 (8%) patients assigned therapeutic anticoagulation and seven (2%) assigned prophylactic anticoagulation (relative risk 3·64 [95% CI 1·61-8·27], p=0·0010). Allergic reaction to the study medication occurred in two (1%) patients in the therapeutic anticoagulation group and three (1%) in the prophylactic anticoagulation group. INTERPRETATION: In patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer concentration, in-hospital therapeutic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban or enoxaparin followed by rivaroxaban to day 30 did not improve clinical outcomes and increased bleeding compared with prophylactic anticoagulation. Therefore, use of therapeutic-dose rivaroxaban, and other direct oral anticoagulants, should be avoided in these patients in the absence of an evidence-based indication for oral anticoagulation.

345651,"An immunization program for US-bound refugees: Development, challenges, and opportunities 2012-present",2021,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there is concern that social distancing, fear of contagion, quarantining of providers, cancellation of elective procedures, media coverage about the pandemic, and other factors drastically reduced physician visits, putting severe financial strain on outpatient providers, and having unknown ramifications for health outcomes. OBJECTIVES: We estimate the effect of the pandemic on utilization of outpatient services. RESEARCH DESIGN: Using 2010-2020 data from a national dataset, the Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network, we estimate the difference in outpatient care utilization during the time period of the COVID-19 pandemic versus the same weeks in prior years. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that the pandemic started to reduce visits during the week of March 15-21. The effect on visits grew until reaching a peak during the week of April 5-11, 2020, when the pandemic reduced the total number of outpatient visits per provider by 70% relative to the same week in prior years. We find negative effects of the pandemic on visits for non-flu symptoms as well as on visits for flu symptoms, but the magnitudes of these latter effects tended to be larger in magnitude. The pandemic's impact declined over time, and by the week of June 28 to July 4, 2020, there was no longer any difference in total visits per provider relative to the same week in prior years. Despite the resurgence of COVID-19 in June and July, we still find no effects on total visits when our data end in July 26 to August 1, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that one by-product of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is a large decline in the use of outpatient care which peaked around the week of April 5-11. Total outpatient visits rebounded completely and remain stable as of July 26 to August 1, 2020.","Chatterji, Pinka; Li, Yue",Med Care,,223

The SARS-CoV-2 genome has the capability of gaining rapid mutations as the virus spreads. Whole-genome sequencing data offers a wide range of opportunities to study mutation dynamics. The advantage of an increasing amount of whole-genome sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 intrigued us to explore the mutation profile across the genome, to check the genome diversity, and to investigate the implications of those mutations in protein stability and viral transmission. We have identified frequently mutated residues by aligning ~660 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and validated in 10,000 datasets available in GISAID Nextstrain. We further evaluated the potential of these frequently mutated residues in protein structure stability of spike glycoprotein and their possible functional consequences in other proteins. Among the 11 genes, surface glycoprotein, nucleocapsid, ORF1ab, and ORF8 showed frequent mutations, while envelop, membrane, ORF6, ORF7a and ORF7b showed conservation in terms of amino acid substitutions. Combined analysis with the frequently mutated residues identified 20 viral variants, among which 12 specific combinations comprised more than 97% of the isolates considered for the analysis. Some of the mutations across different proteins showed co-occurrences, suggesting their structural and/or functional interaction among different SARS-COV-2 proteins, and their involvement in adaptability and viral transmission. Analysis of protein structure stability of surface glycoprotein mutants indicated the viability of specific variants and are more prone to be temporally and spatially distributed across the globe. A similar empirical analysis of other proteins indicated the existence of important functional implications of several variants. Identification of frequently mutated variants among COVID-19 patients might be useful for better clinical management, contact tracing, and containment of the disease.","Laha, Sayantan; Chakraborty, Joyeeta; Das, Shantanab; Manna, Soumen Kanti; Biswas, Sampa; Chatterjee, Raghunath",Infect Genet Evol,,223

While some individuals prepared with personal safety supplies such as soap and hand sanitizer, many others did not purchase such preparatory products. There are many health and safety benefits to quick engagement and emergency preparedness in a pandemic, and it is important to identify those who conduct these behaviors. The present study examined who engaged in preparatory purchasing of safety and health care products during the early stages of the spread of COVID-19 and what stimulated this action. Results of a cross-sectional study (N = 344) indicates that possessing, or uncertainty about possessing a COVID-19 risk factor (but not differences in age, gender, race, or income), increased purchasing of preparatory health and safety products. Also, in line with past research on risk, affect, and behavior, worry mediated this relationship. Further, gender moderated the relationship between worry and purchasing, such that worry increased product purchasing for men, who were initially low in worry, but not for women. This study lends additional support to worry as a mediator between risk and safety-related behavior and has implications for understanding factors related to preparatory purchasing of health care products during pandemics.","Clemens, Kelly S.; Matkovic, John; Faasse, Kate; Geers, Andrew L.",Saf.

Various models have been built to explore the reactions of all relevant stakeholders during a contamination event or other emergencies and disasters utilizing agent-based modeling. None of them considers the social background and the possibly related psychological states of the affected population. This study proposes to use recent findings during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and draw analogies regarding response and reaction to a disaster on a major scale for implementing it in an agent-based model framework for reacting to a contamination event in a water network. A hydraulic simulation is coupled with an agent-based model which consists of consumer agents and a utility manager. Upon detection of anomalies in the water quality, the utility manager places mobile sensor equipment to emulate ""contact tracing,"" determine endangered areas in the water network, and warn the consumer agents in real time about the geographical spread of the event through, e.g., social media. The consumer agents' actions are determined according to their social backgrounds, location in the water network, and possible symptoms from ingesting contaminated water by utilizing a fuzzy logic system. Results on an example application suggest that placing mobile equipment and warning consumers in real time is essential as a proper response to a contamination event. Furthermore, social background factors like age or employment status of the population can play a vital role in the response of consumer agents to a water quality contamination event in a water distribution system. © ASCE.","Kadinski, L.; Ostfeld, A.",World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2021: Planning a Resilient Future along America&#039;s Freshwaters,,223

Based on an abundance of engineered materials identifiable by their useful physicochemical properties through versatile chemical functionalization, nanotechnology offers a number of approaches to cope with this emergency. Here, through a multidisciplinary Perspective encompassing diverse fields such as virology, biology, medicine, engineering, chemistry, materials science, and computational science, we outline how nanotechnology-based strategies can support the fight against COVID-19, as well as infectious diseases in general, including future pandemics. Considering what we know so far about the life cycle of the virus, we envision key steps where nanotechnology could counter the disease. First, nanoparticles (NPs) can offer alternative methods to classical disinfection protocols used in healthcare settings, thanks to their intrinsic antipathogenic properties and/or their ability to inactivate viruses, bacteria, fungi, or yeasts either photothermally or via photocatalysis-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Nanotechnology tools to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in patients could also be explored. In this case, nanomaterials could be used to deliver drugs to the pulmonary system to inhibit interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and viral S protein. Moreover, the concept of ""nanoimmunity by design"" can help us to design materials for immune modulation, either stimulating or suppressing the immune response, which would find applications in the context of vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 or in counteracting the cytokine storm, respectively. In addition to disease prevention and therapeutic potential, nanotechnology has important roles in diagnostics, with potential to support the development of simple, fast, and cost-effective nanotechnology-based assays to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and related biomarkers. In summary, nanotechnology is critical in counteracting COVID-19 and will be vital when preparing for future pandemics.","Weiss, Carsten; Carriere, Marie; Fusco, Laura; Capua, Ilaria; Regla-Nava, Jose Angel; Pasquali, Matteo; Scott, James A; Vitale, Flavia; Unal, Mehmet Altay; Mattevi, Cecilia; Bedognetti, Davide; Merkoçi, Arben; Tasciotti, Ennio; Yilmazer, Açelya; Gogotsi, Yury; Stellacci, Francesco; Delogu, Lucia Gemma",ACS Nano,,223

Method: We performed a comprehensive literature search of several databases and qualitatively synthesized findings from studies. Results: Twenty-six studies were included with 1228 pooled subjects, with a mean age of 8.6 years, which were dominated by male gender (53%), and African ethnicity (31%). 732 (38%) patients were reactive on a serological test, and 457 patients (45%) were positive on SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. ST-segment abnormalities were the most common ECG findings (16%, n/N: 34/212). Various markers of troponin and the pooled mean of BNP and NT-pro-BNP levels were elevated. Cardiomegaly and pericardial effusion (21.8%, n/N: 164/751) was the most common chest X-ray findings. In echocardiography, the majority of patients' left ventricular ejection fraction was reduced (59.0%, n/N: 180/305), with pericardial effusion/ pericarditis seen the most (17.44%, n/N: 221/1267), and Z score &#8805; 2 in 28% (n/N: 42/139). Cardiac MRI findings were consistent with acute myocarditis. Intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, and vasoactive drugs were frequently utilized. The mean length of stay was 6 days, with most patients (71%, n/N: 834/1163) were admitted to the ICU. However, the overall prognosis was favourable, with 98% alive (n/N: 1235/1260), and more than 50% of patients experienced recovery of left ventricular systolic functions at discharge (116 out of 206 patients). Conclusion: PIMS-TS is a rare clinical syndrome associated with a multiorgan system dysfunction, especially acute cardiac injury, and mandates a higher level of care.Nevertheless, when appropriate treatments are available, the cardiac function rapidly reverted to normal in most cases, and it was associated with a favourable outcome in general. Of concern, medium and long-term prognosis remains to be elucidated.","Henrina, Joshua; Putra, Iwan Cahyo Santosa; Lawrensia, Sherly; Marta, Della Sabrina; Wijaya, Ellen; Saboe, Aninka; Cool, Charlotte Johanna; Suciadi, Leonardo Paskah",Prog Pediatr Cardiol,,223
350150,The Potential of Artificial Intelligence to Analyze Chest Radiographs for Signs of COVID-19 Pneumonia,2020,"BACKGROUND: Many health care facilities in low- and middle-income countries are inadequately resourced. COVID-19 has the potential to decimate surgical health care services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect health care workers from viral exposure and ensure the continuity of specialized care for patients. Among these measures, the timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is paramount to ensure the use of protective measures and isolation of patients to prevent transmission to health care personnel caring for patients with an unknown COVID-19 status or contact during the pandemic. Besides molecular and antibody tests, chest computed tomography (CT) has been assessed as a potential tool to aid in the screening or diagnosis of COVID-19 and could be valuable in the emergency care setting. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for an umbrella review that aims to identify and summarize the available literature on the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT for COVID-19 in trauma surgery patients requiring urgent care. The objective is to inform future recommendations on emergency care for this category of patients. METHODS: We will conduct several searches in the L·OVE (Living Overview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and over 30 other sources. The search results will be presented according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis). This review will preferentially consider systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies, as well as individual studies of such design, if not included in the systematic reviews, that assessed the sensitivity and specificity of chest CT in emergency trauma surgery patients. Critical appraisal of the included studies for risk of bias will be conducted. Data will be extracted using a standardized data extraction tool. Findings will be summarized narratively, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach will be used to grade the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Ethics approval is not required for this systematic review, as there will be no patient involvement. The search for this systematic review commenced in October 2020, and we expect to publish the findings in early 2021. The plan for dissemination is to publish the findings in a peer-reviewed journal and present our results at conferences that engage the most pertinent stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, protecting health care workers from infection is essential. Up-to-date information on the efficacy of diagnostic tests for detecting COVID-19 is essential. This review will serve an important role as a thorough summary to inform evidence-based recommendations on establishing effective policy and clinical guideline recommendations.

351764,Prophylaxis of Epidemic Spreading with Transient Dynamics,2020-07-15,"RATIONALE: To understand novel diseases, patients may draw comparisons to other diseases. OBJECTIVE: We examined whether mentally associating specific diseases with COVID-19 was related to self-reported protective behaviors early in the pandemic. METHODS: In March 2020, a national sample of 6534 U.S. adults listed diseases that came to mind when thinking of COVID-19. They self-reported protective behaviors, demographics, and COVID-19 risk perceptions. RESULTS: Participants associated COVID-19 with common infectious diseases like seasonal influenza (59%), common cold (11%), and pneumonia (10%), or emergent infectious diseases like pandemic influenza (28%), SARS/MERS (27%), and Ebola (14%). Seasonal influenza was most commonly mentioned, in all demographic groups. Participants mentioning seasonal influenza or common cold reported fewer protective behaviors. Those mentioning pneumonia or emergent infectious diseases reported more protective behaviors. Mentioning pneumonia, SARS/MERS, and Ebola was associated with the most protective behaviors, after accounting for other generated diseases, demographics, and risk perceptions (e.g., for avoiding crowds, OR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.26, 1.83; OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.13, 1.46; OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.11, 1.52, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Early in the pandemic, most participants mentally associated COVID-19 with seasonal flu, which may have undermined willingness to protect themselves. To motivate behavior change, COVID-19 risk communications may need to mention diseases that resonate with people while retaining accuracy.","Bruine de Bruin, Wändi; Carman, Katherine G; Parker, Andrew M",Soc Sci Med,,223

356944,A note from the editor-in-chief,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak in late December 2019 has quickly emerged into pandemic in 2020. We aimed to describe the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and to investigate the potential risk factors for COVID-19 severity. METHOD: 1663 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosed COVID-19 from Tongji Hospital between January 14, 2020, and February 28, 2020 were included in the present study. Demographic information, exposure history, medical history, comorbidities, signs and symptoms, chest computed tomography (CT) scanning, severity of COVID-19 and laboratory findings on admission were collected from electronic medical records. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the association between potential risk factors with COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: In the present study, the majority (79%) of 1663 COVID-19 patients were aged over 50 years old. A total of 2.8% were medical staff, and an exposure history of Huanan seafood market was document in 0.7%, and 7.4% were family infection. Fever (85.8%), cough (36.0%), fatigue (23.6%) and chest tightness (11.9%) were the most common symptoms in COVID-19 patients. As of February 28, 2020, of the 1663 patients included in this study, 26.0% were discharged, 10.2% were died, and 63.8% remained hospitalized. More than 1/3 of the patients had at least one comorbidity. Most (99.8%) patients had abnormal results Chest CT, and the most common manifestations of chest CT were local patchy shadowing (70.7%) and ground-glass opacity (44.8%). On admission, lymphocytopenia was present in 51.1% of the patients, mononucleosis in 26.6%, and erythrocytopenia in 61.3%. Most of the patients had increased levels of C-reactive protein (80.4%) and D-dimer (64.4%). Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients had more obvious abnormal laboratory results related to inflammation, coagulation disorders, liver and kidney damage (all P < 0.05). Older age (OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.47-3.83), leukocytosis (OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.47-3.83), and increased creatine kinase (OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.47-3.83) on admission were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSION: Timely medical treatment and clear diagnosis after the onset might be beneficial to control the condition of COVID-19. Severe patients were more likely to be to be elder, and tended to have higher proportion of comorbidities and more prominent laboratory abnormalities. Older age, leukocytosis, and increased creatine kinase might help clinicians to identify severe patients with COVID-19.","Yu, Caizheng; Lei, Qing; Li, Wenkai; Wang, Xiong; Li, Wengang; Liu, Wei",J Infect Public Health,,223

The role and outcome of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in the management of COVID-19 is currently unclear. Eight COVID-19 patients have received ECMO support in Shanghai with seven with venovenous (VV) ECMO support and one veno arterial (VA) ECMO during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. As of March 25, 2020, four patients died (50% mortality), three patients (37.5%) were successfully weaned off ECMO after 22, 40, and 47 days support, respectively, but remain on mechanical ventilation. One patient is still on VV ECMO with mechanical ventilation. The partial pressure of oxygen/fractional of inspired oxygen ratio before ECMO initiation was between 54 and 76, and all were well below 100. The duration of mechanical ventilation before ECMO ranged from 4 to 21 days. Except the one emergent VA ECMO during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, other patients were on ECMO support for between 18 and 47 days. In conclusion, ensuring effective, timely, and safe ECMO support in COVID-19 is key to improving clinical outcomes. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support might be an integral part of the critical care provided for COVID-19 patients in centers with advanced ECMO expertise.","Li, Xin; Guo, Zhen; Li, Bailing; Zhang, Xiaolin; Tian, Rui; Wu, Wei; Zhang, Zhongwei; Lu, Yunfei; Chen, Nan; Clifford, Sean P; Huang, Jiapeng",ASAIO J,,223

In four groups of adults of both sexes including recent suicide attempters (nâ¯=â¯57), suicidal ideators (nâ¯=â¯131), non-suicidal depressed controls (nâ¯=â¯51) and healthy controls (nâ¯=â¯48) we examined time estimation and production, impulsivity and other cognitive variables. Duration of the suicidal process was recorded in suicide attempters. The suicide process duration, suicide contemplation and action intervals, had a bimodal distribution, â¼40% of attempters took less than 5 min from decision to attempt. Time slowing correlated negatively with the suicidal action interval (time from the decision to kill oneself to suicide attempt) (pâ¯=â¯.003). Individuals with suicide contemplation interval shorter than three hours showed increased time slowing, measured as shorter time production at 35 s (pâ¯=â¯.011) and 43 s (pâ¯=â¯.036). Delay discounting for rewards correlated with time estimation at 25 min (pâ¯=â¯.02) and 90 s (pâ¯=â¯.01). Time slowing correlated positively with suicidal ideation severity, independently of depression severity (pâ¯<â¯.001). Perception of time slowing may influence both the intensity and the duration of the suicidal process. Time slowing may initially be triggered by intense psychological pain, then worsen the perception of inescapability in suicidal patients.","Cáceda, Ricardo; Carbajal, Jessica M; Salomon, Ronald M; Moore, Jordan E; Perlman, Greg; Padala, Prasad R; Hasan, Abdullah; Delgado, Pedro L",Eur. neuropsychopharmacol,,223

It was anonymous at the source and included history of COVID-19-related questions (fever, headache, cold, cough, anosmia, gastrointestinal complaints and separately fever over 38.5°C) in the previous three weeks, and similar information on cohabitants. A total of 14 374 subjects were included. Overall, from 24 March to 30 April, 3138 subjects (21.8%) reported COVID-19-like symptoms, and 219 (1.5%) fever above 38.5°C; 217 subjects performed at least one swab. Of these, 46 were positive (21.3% of those performed, 0.3% of the total). The frequency of any symptom was similar in women and men, but fever above 38.5°C was lower in women (multivariate odds ratio (OR) = 0.65, 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.49-0.85). There was a strong association between symptoms in the respondent and in cohabitants: 64% of subjects with symptoms reported at least one cohabitant with symptoms, compared to 14% of asymptomatic subjects (OR = 11.4, 95% CI, 10.4-12.6). The lower risk of serious symptoms in women, and the strong intra-nucleus of cohabitation contagiousness are an indication that at least part of the symptoms was caused by a new pathogen - SARS-CoV-2. These data, therefore, suggest that the number of persons affected by COVID-19 was much greater in northern Italy than the number of recorded cases.

The enrolled patients were those with confirmed diagnosis of severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia, who received HDIVC within 24 hours after disease aggravation. Main clinical outcomes obtained from 3-5 days (day 3) and 7-10 days (day 7) after HDIVC were compared to the ones just before (day 0) HDIVC. RESULTS: Totally, twelve patients were enrolled including six severe [age of mean, 56; interquartile range (IQR), 32-65 years, 3 men] and six critical (age of mean, 63; IQR, 60-82 years, 4 men) patients. The dosage of vitamin C [median (IQR), mg/kg (body weight)/day] were [162.7 (71.1-328.6)] for severe and [178.6 (133.3-350.6)] for critical patients. By Generalized estimating equation (GEE) model, C-reactive protein (CRP) was found to decrease significantly from day 0 to 3 and 7 (severe: 59.01±37.9, 12.36±22.12, 8.95±20.4; critical: 92.5±41.21, 33.9±30.2, 59.56±41.4 mg/L).

Nowadays, highways often have sensors installed across their range that collect data such as speed, density, direction and so on. In addition, the rapid evolution of vehicles with installed computer systems and sensors on board, provides a very large amount of data, ranging from very simple features such as speed, acceleration, etc. to very complex data like the driver’s situation and driving behavior. However, these data alone and without any further processing, cannot solve the congestion problem.

364280,In Focus,2020,"Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) imposes a serious public health pandemic affecting the whole world, as it is spreading exponentially. Besides its high infectivity, SARS-CoV-2 causes multiple serious derangements, where the most prominent is severe acute respiratory syndrome as well as multiple organ dysfunction including heart and kidney injury. While the deleterious impact of SARS-CoV-2 on pulmonary and cardiac systems have attracted remarkable attention, the adverse effects of this virus on the renal system is still underestimated. Kidney susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection is determined by the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor which is used as port of the viral entry into targeted cells, tissue tropism, pathogenicity and subsequent viral replication. The SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry receptor, ACE2, is widely expressed in proximal epithelial cells, vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells and podocytes, where it supports kidney integrity and function via the enzymatic production of Angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), which exerts vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and diuretic/natriuretic actions via activation of the Mas receptor axis. Loss of this activity constitutes the potential basis for the renal damage that occurs in COVID-19 patients. Indeed, several studies in a small sample of COVID-19 patients revealed relatively high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) among them. Although SARS-CoV-1 -induced AKI was attributed to multiorgan failure and cytokine release syndrome, as the virus was not detectable in the renal tissue of infected patients, SARS-CoV-2 antigens were detected in kidney tubules, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infects the human kidney directly, and eventually induces AKI characterized with high morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are largely unknown. However, the fact that ACE2 plays a crucial role against renal injury, the deprivation of the kidney of this advantageous enzyme, along with local viral replication, probably plays a central role. The current review focuses on the critical role of ACE2 in renal physiology, its involvement in the development of kidney injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection, renal manifestations and therapeutic options. The latter includes exogenous administration of Ang (1-7) as an appealing option, given the high incidence of AKI in this ACE2-depleted disorder, and the benefits of ACE2/Ang1-7 including vasodilation, diuresis, natriuresis, attenuation of inflammation, oxidative stress, cell proliferation, apoptosis and coagulation.","Armaly, Zaher; Kinaneh, Safa; Skorecki, Karl",,,223
364287,Topological network measures for drug repositioning,2020,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has triggered serious disruption in economic, social and cultural dynamics around the globe. Higher education has also suffered undeniable challenges as a result of the pandemic, with thousands of university students all over the world experiencing displacement, disconnect and disengagement from formal learning. In the Global South, online and distance education programmes tend to be concentrated in urban centres. In Nepal, students from rural areas, low socio-economic and gendered spaces, and those with low proficiencies in English and technological skills are experiencing inequalities in access to and participation in online and distance education. This article outlines how universities' shift to online teaching and learning modes due to the COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced social inequalities in Nepal. For the study presented here, the author collected data through netnographic research methods. These included online interviews with university executives, online focus group discussions (FGDs) with university teachers and students, observation of and participation in online classes and policy conferences and reviews of online documents. The article analyses three overriding mechanisms which are reinforcing social inequalities in higher education: (1) universities' policy trajectories in shifting teaching/learning from face-to-face to online mode; (2) infrastructural limitations challenging effective implementation of online teaching/learning; and (3) a lack of strong pedagogic support for students from disadvantaged and marginalised spaces, including those with low proficiencies in English and technological skills. The author presents a number of tangible strategies for universities to implement in order to mitigate social inequalities. He recommends the adoption of policies and practices that optimise the inclusive use of online and distance education programmes for best effect, both now and in the post-pandemic era.","Devkota, Kamal Raj",Int Rev Educ,,223

369027,Inference in Stochastic Epidemic Models via Multinomial Approximations,2020-06-24,"BACKGROUND: Vaccine-induced population immunity is a key global strategy to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The rapid implementation and availability of several COVID-19 vaccines is now a global health-care priority but more information about humoral responses to single- and double-dose vaccine is needed. METHODS: 163 health care workers (HCW) of the Padua University Hospitals, who underwent a complete vaccination campaign with BNT162b2 vaccine were asked to collect serum samples at 12 (t12) and 28 (t28) days after the first inoculum to allow the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies (Ab) using chemiluminescent assays against the spike (S) protein and the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the virus, respectively. RESULTS: Significant differences were found at t12 for infection-naïve and subjects with previous-natural infection who present higher values of specific antibodies, while no significant differences have been found between t12 and t28. No statistically significant difference was found between male and female, while lower Ab levels have been observed in subjects older than 60 years at t12 but not at t28. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms observed differences in vaccine responses between infection-naïve and subjects with previous natural infection at t12 but not for a longer time. The influence of sex and age deserves further studies, even if the relationship with age seems particularly significant.","Padoan, Andrea; Dall039,; Olmo, Luigi; Rocca, Foscarina Della; Barbaro, Francesco; Cosma, Chiara; Basso, Daniela; Cattelan, Annamaria; Cianci, Vito; Plebani, Mario",Clin Chim Acta,,223

Because approved drugs and vaccines are limited or not available, new options for COVID-19 treatment and prevention are in high demand. To identify SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies, we analyzed the antibody response of 12 COVID-19 patients from 8 to 69 days after diagnosis. By screening 4,313 SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cells, we isolated 255 antibodies from different time points as early as 8 days after diagnosis. Of these, 28 potently neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with IC100 as low as 0.04 µg/mL, showing a broad spectrum of variable (V) genes and low levels of somatic mutations. Interestingly, potential precursor sequences were identified in naive B cell repertoires from 48 healthy individuals who were sampled before the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies are readily generated from a diverse pool of precursors, fostering hope for rapid induction of a protective immune response upon vaccination.","Kreer, Christoph; Zehner, Matthias; Weber, Timm; Ercanoglu, Meryem S; Gieselmann, Lutz; Rohde, Cornelius; Halwe, Sandro; Korenkov, Michael; Schommers, Philipp; Vanshylla, Kanika; Di Cristanziano, Veronica; Janicki, Hanna; Brinker, Reinhild; Ashurov, Artem; Krähling, Verena; Kupke, Alexandra; Cohen-Dvashi, Hadas; Koch, Manuel; Eckert, Jan Mathis; Lederer, Simone; Pfeifer, Nico; Wolf, Timo; Vehreschild, Maria J G T; Wendtner, Clemens; Diskin, Ron; Gruell, Henning; Becker, Stephan; Klein, Florian",Cell,,223

Over 80% of these individuals (1.2 million) received the ChAdOx1-S/nCoV-19 vaccine. In this population, during this period of 4 weeks (mid-March to mid-April 2021), we observed seven cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) that occurred within 2 weeks of the first dose of vaccination. All seven patients developed severe GBS. The frequency of GBS was 1.4- to 10-fold higher than that expected in this period for a population of this magnitude. In addition, the frequency of bilateral facial weakness, which typically occurs in <20% of GBS cases, suggests a pattern associated with the vaccination. While the benefits of vaccination substantially outweigh the risk of this relatively rare outcome (5.8 per million), clinicians should be alert to this possible adverse event, as six out of seven patients progressed to areflexic quadriplegia and required mechanical ventilatory support.

METHODS: Sixteen male pigs were studied in two groups. The Group Surgery was composed of 8 animals submitted to a Roux en Y gastric bypass. The Group Control comprised 8 pigs receiving identical care, except for the surgical procedure. Group Surgery was followed for 90 days, when the bypassed gastric segment was resected. Group Control was followed for 84 days, when the stomach was resected. RESULTS: Weight loss and the amount of food intake were evaluated in both groups. Macroscopic findings, histopathologic changes of the gastric wall, gastric gland morphometry and the amount of collagen type I and III of the gastric mucosa in the bypassed gastric segment were evaluated. Group Control exhibited a significant larger weight gain and food intake compared to surgery. The gastric glands were smaller and type I collagen was predominant in Surgery compared to Control. No changes were noted in the type III collagen. Fat tissue was identified among the muscle fibers in the isolated segment of Group Surgery. CONCLUSION: This model of Roux en Y gastric bypass in pigs offers consistent weight and food intake reduction. Secondly, Roux en Y gastric bypass in pigs does not induce macroscopic changes in mucosa. Finally, the histopathological findings are consistent with initial atrophy of the isolated gastric segment.","Sérgio Brenner, Antonio; Fraga, Rogério; Conceição, Mario; Müller Júnior, Léo; DeMarchi, Roberto; Cravo Bettini, Solange; Bellaver, Cláudio; Loddo, Giovanni; Batista Marchesini, João",Acta cir. bras.,,223

However, the low femtomolar to attomolar concentration of nucleic acids in human samples require sensors with excellent detection capabilities; many past and current platforms fall short or are economically difficult. Strand-mediated signal amplifiers such as hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) are superior methods for detecting trace amounts of biomolecules because one target molecule triggers the continuous production of synthetic double-helical DNA. This cascade event is highly discriminatory to the target via sequence specificity, and it can be coupled with fluorescence, electrochemistry, magnetic moment, and electrochemiluminescence for signal reporting. Here, we review recent advances in enhancing the sensing abilities in HCR and CHA for improved live-cell imaging efficiency, lowered limit of detection, and optimized multiplexity. We further outline the potential for clinical translatability of HCR and CHA by summarizing progress in employing these two tools for in vivo imaging, human sample testing, and sensing-treating dualities. We finally discuss their future prospects and suggest clinically-relevant experiments to supplement further related research.","Borum, Raina M; Jokerst, Jesse V",Biomaterials science,,223

This preliminary study addresses this research gap through an empirical study of the Polish national vaccination program against COVID-19. Approach/Methodology/Design: This paper's insights have emerged iteratively by considering both theory and the empirical case based on vaccination against COVID-19 program analysis. This approach is consistent with an abductive approach. Findings: A study revealed a need to use framing in developing and implementing vaccination strategies. Lack offraming in strategic communication of vaccination leads to the potentially radical suggestion that government should change their current vaccination information policy if they want to avoid poor outcomes. The findings make three contributions. First, they illustrate how framing can influence engagement to multiple goals;Second, they contribute to grounding framing theory within public management by showing how framing may use across contexts;Third, they elaborate the importance of framing in strategic programs. Practical Implications: The article brings several valuable pieces of information that can be the base material and reference to further research. It provides practical tips. Originality/Value: There are several studies on strategy or framing;however, the research question - whether the government's vaccination strategy against COVID-19 uses framing to shape the right message to increase public confidence in the vaccination program was without an answer.

Although roles of active Gsk3 in liver ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) have been well appreciated, whether Gsk3 N-terminal serine phosphorylation has any functional significance in the disease process remains unclear. In a murine liver partial warm ischemia model, we studied Gsk3 N-terminal serine mutant knock-in (KI) mice and showed that liver IRI was decreased in Gsk3&#945;S21A but increased in Gsk3ßS9A mutant KI mice. Bone marrow chimeric experiments revealed that the Gsk3&#945;, but not ß, mutation in liver parenchyma protected from IRI, and both mutations in bone marrow-derived cells exacerbated liver injuries. Mechanistically, mutant Gsk3&#945; protected hepatocytes from inflammatory (TNF-&#945;) cell death by the activation of HIV-1 TAT-interactive protein 60 (TIP60)-mediated autophagy pathway. The pharmacological inhibition of TIP60 or autophagy diminished the protection of the Gsk3&#945; mutant hepatocytes from inflammatory cell death in vitro and the Gsk3&#945; mutant KI mice from liver IRI in vivo. Thus, Gsk3 N-terminal serine phosphorylation inhibits liver innate immune activation but suppresses hepatocyte autophagy in response to inflammation. Gsk3 &#945;S21, but not ßS9, mutation is sufficient to sustain Gsk4 activities in hepatocytes and protect livers from IRI via TIP60 activation.","Ni, Ming; Zhou, Haoming; Zhang, Jing; Jin, Dan; Lu, Tianfei; Busuttil, Ronald W; Kupiec-Weglinski, Jerzy W; Wang, Xuehao; Zhai, Yuan",J. immunol,,223

DESIGN: Multicentre, open label, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 16 government designated covid-19 treatment centres in China, 11 to 29 February 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 150 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed covid-19 were included in the intention to treat analysis (75 patients assigned to hydroxychloroquine plus standard of care, 75 to standard of care alone). INTERVENTIONS: Hydroxychloroquine administrated at a loading dose of 1200 mg daily for three days followed by a maintenance dose of 800 mg daily (total treatment duration: two or three weeks for patients with mild to moderate or severe disease, respectively). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Negative conversion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by 28 days, analysed according to the intention to treat principle. Adverse events were analysed in the safety population in which hydroxychloroquine recipients were participants who received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and hydroxychloroquine non-recipients were those managed with standard of care alone. RESULTS: Of 150 patients, 148 had mild to moderate disease and two had severe disease. The mean duration from symptom onset to randomisation was 16.6 (SD 10.5; range 3-41) days. A total of 109 (73%) patients (56 standard of care; 53 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine) had negative conversion well before 28 days, and the remaining 41 (27%) patients (19 standard of care; 22 standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine) were censored as they did not reach negative conversion of virus. The probability of negative conversion by 28 days in the standard of care plus hydroxychloroquine group was 85.4% (95% confidence interval 73.8% to 93.8%), similar to that in the standard of care group (81.3%, 71.2% to 89.6%). The difference between groups was 4.1% (95% confidence interval -10.3% to 18.5%). In the safety population, adverse events were recorded in 7/80 (9%) hydroxychloroquine non-recipients and in 21/70 (30%) hydroxychloroquine recipients. The most common adverse event in the hydroxychloroquine recipients was diarrhoea, reported in 7/70 (10%) patients. Two hydroxychloroquine recipients reported serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of hydroxychloroquine did not result in a significantly higher probability of negative conversion than standard of care alone in patients admitted to hospital with mainly persistent mild to moderate covid-19. Adverse events were higher in hydroxychloroquine recipients than in non-recipients.

Contraction occurs mainly in the lateral epidermal cells, while the dorsoventral epidermis plays a more passive role. Two parallel pathways trigger actinomyosin contraction, one mediated by LET-502/Rho kinase and the other by PAK-1/p21 activated kinase. A number of genes mediating morphogenesis have been shown to be sufficient when expressed either laterally or dorsoventrally. Additional genes show either lateral or dorsoventral phenotypes. This led us to a model where contractile genes have discrete functions in one or the other cell type. We tested this by examining several genes for either lateral or dorsoventral sufficiency. LET-502 expression in the lateral cells was sufficient to drive elongation. MEL-11/Myosin phosphatase, which antagonizes contraction, and PAK-1 were expected to function dorsoventrally, but we could not detect tissue-specific sufficiency. Double mutants of lethal alleles predicted to decrease lateral contraction with those thought to increase dorsoventral force were previously shown to be viable. We hypothesized that these mutant combinations shifted the contractile force from the lateral to the dorsoventral cells and so the embryos would elongate with less lateral cell contraction. This was tested by examining ten single and double mutant strains. In most cases, elongation proceeded without a noticeable alteration in lateral contraction. We suggest that many embryonic elongation genes likely act in both lateral and dorsoventral cells, even though they may have their primary focus in one or the other cell type.","Drewnik, Elizabeth D; Wiesenfahrt, Tobias; Smit, Ryan B; Park, Ye-Jean; Pallotto, Linda M; Mains, Paul E",G3 (Bethesda Md.),,223

382463,MUSE: Multi-Scale Temporal Features Evolution for Knowledge Tracing,2021-01-30,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Clinicians face a multitude of ethical conflicts in their daily practice. There have been no studies on the types of ethical conflicts encountered most frequently and that are of most concern to clinicians in Spain. The aim of this study is to report the most common ethical conflicts faced by Spanish internists, as well as the importance that the practitioners attribute to each conflict. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our observational cross-sectional study employed a voluntary and anonymous survey aimed at Spanish medical internists and distributed through an ad hoc platform of the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine. RESULTS: The most common and relevant ethical issues for Spanish internists are related to patients' end of life (decisions limiting therapeutic effort, use of palliative treatments, the establishment of do-not-resuscitate orders), the conflicts arising within the doctor-patient/family relationship, and making decisions with noncompetent patients. These results are similar to those of other English and European series. The ethical problems further complicate the healthcare activity of clinicians who more often notice these problems (50.3%) than those who do not notice them (16%). CONCLUSIONS: The most common and relevant ethical conflicts among Spanish internists are related to managing patients' end of life, followed by those related to the doctor-patient relationship and the management of noncompetent patients. It is essential that training programs be designed to better address and recognise these problems.","Blanco Portillo, A; García-Caballero, R; Real de Asúa, D; Herreros Ruíz-Valdepeñas, B",Rev. clin. esp.

383996,"Donating our ""Christmas bonus""",2021,"Objective: The aim of this project was to convert a traditional face-to-face seminar for the teaching of experimental scientific methodology to remote teaching in a timely manner due to the COVID-19 related restrictions to teaching in presence. Methodology: The main focus of the course was on flow cytometry. Basics were developed in a virtual presence phase. Specific teaching contents were taught by an interactive presentation, which came very close to the user experience of a flow cytometer and interactively illustrated the influence of different experimental conditions on the obtained results. Video sequences of authentic sample acquisitions were integrated into Adobe Captivate®. These ""virtual acquisitions"" were not distinguishable from the original procedure. For interpretation of the resulting diagrams, interactions were inserted, which allowed direct comparison of the obtained results. Implementation: A presentation with interactive elements and video sequences was created and used for the virtual presence phases. After publishing on a web server in HTML 5, contents were made available to the students for post-processing of learning contents by self-paced learning with full (interactive) functionality. Conclusion: Contributions elaborated by the students during the course demonstrate a learning outcome comparable to that archieved in the last years in presence mode. While implementation of this solution represented a highly time-consuming process, narrative feedback was consistently positive. Due to the short time available for implementation, no systematic evaluation could be conducted, which represents a clear limitation of this work.","Assinger, Alice; Grasl, Matthäus; Volf, Ivo",GMS J Med Educ,,223

384739,Food shortages unlikely during coronavirus outbreak,2020,"OBJECTIVES: to describe the overall mortality increase in the provinces of Milan and Lodi - area covered by the Agency for Health Protection of Milan - during the COVID-19 epidemic in the first four months of 2020, compare it with the same time period in the years 2016-2019, and evaluate to what extent the mortality can be directly attributed to the outbreak. DESIGN: cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: using a new information system developed during the pandemic, we gathered data on the number of daily deaths in the population residing in the provinces of Milan and Lodi by Local Health Unit (ASST) and age groups. To describe the case fatality of COVID-19, we performed a record linkage with a database specially constructed during the epidemic to identify deaths that occurred in confirmed cases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: mortality and excess mortality were analysed by comparing the number of observed deaths in the first 4 months of 2020 with the average deaths of the years 2016-2019 in the same calendar period and with expected deaths, estimated using a Poisson model. Furthermore, a measure of relative risk was calculated as observed/expected ratio with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: the increase in mortality for all causes occurring in the study population in the first 4 months of 2020 was 48.8%, 30.8% for ages between 60 and 69, 43.9% for ages between 70 and 79, and 56.7% for subjects above 80 years of age. Focusing on the epidemic period, from 1 March to 30 April, the excess is quantifiable as more than 2-fold and mainly concerns the population over 60 years of age. The excess mortality was observed in all local health units (ASSTs). The highest increments were in the province of Lodi and the North-East of Milan (ASST Nord). In the ASSTs of Lodi and Melegnano-Martesana the mortality excess was detectable from March 15th, while for the other ASSTs the increase began in the first week of April. CONCLUSIONS: evaluation of overall mortality in the provinces of Milan and Lodi during the first wave of the Covid-19 epidemic showed a significant excess compared to the first 4 months of the years 2016-2019, mainly in the population over 60 years of age. However, this excess cannot be completely attributed directly to COVID-19 itself. This phenomenon was more intense in the Lodi ASST, with daily deaths up to 5 times higher than expected.","Sandrini, Monica; Andreano, Anita; Murtas, Rossella; Tunesi, Sara; Riussi, Antonio; Guido, Davide; Greco, Maria Teresa; Gattoni, Maria Elena; Gervasi, Federico; Consolazio, David; Adreoni, Laura; Decarli, Adriano; Russo, Antonio Giampiero",Epidemiol Prev,,223

The over-the-counter histamine-2 receptor antagonist famotidine is a putative therapy for COVID-19. We quantitively assessed longitudinal changes in patient reported outcome measures in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who self-administered high-dose famotidine orally. DESIGN: Patients were enrolled consecutively after signing written informed consent. Data on demographics, COVID-19 diagnosis, famotidine use, drug-related side effects, temperature measurements, oxygen saturations and symptom scores were obtained using questionnaires and telephone interviews. Based on a National Institute of Health (NIH)-endorsed Protocol to research Patient Experience of COVID-19, we collected longitudinal severity scores of five symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, headaches and anosmia) and general unwellness on a four-point ordinal scale modelled on performance status scoring. All data are reported at the patient level. Longitudinal combined normalised symptom scores were statistically compared. RESULTS: Ten consecutive patients with COVID-19 who self-administered high-dose oral famotidine were identified. The most frequently used famotidine regimen was 80 mg three times daily (n=6) for a median of 11 days (range: 5-21 days). Famotidine was well tolerated. All patients reported marked improvements of disease related symptoms after starting famotidine. The combined symptom score improved significantly within 24 hours of starting famotidine and peripheral oxygen saturation (n=2) and device recorded activity (n=1) increased. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this case series suggest that high-dose oral famotidine is well tolerated and associated with improved patient-reported outcomes in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19.","Janowitz, Tobias; Gablenz, Eva; Pattinson, David; Wang, Timothy C; Conigliaro, Joseph; Tracey, Kevin; Tuveson, David",Gut,,223

Tourism is a significant contributor to the local economy and in 2017 the Highlands welcomed 534,000 visitors. Health services across the region treat tourists in addition to the local population. We investigated how many tourists accessed the Trauma and Orthopaedic (T&O) Department at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study with data collected over one year (2017). The number of tourists referred to T&O including patient demographics, country of origin, type of injury and their clinical outcome were recorded. A freedom of information (FOI) request to NHS Highland was sought to investigate associated costs incurred by tourists. RESULTS: 376 tourists accessed T&O services in 2017. Country of origin: 47 (12.5%) Scotland; 177 (47.1%) rest of UK; 74 (19.7%) EU; 45 (12.0%) non-EU. Highest referral month August (61), lowest referral month November (8). Injuries: 224 (59.6%) fracture; 62 (16.5%) soft tissue injury; 20 (5.3%) laceration. Commonest sites of injury were ankle, distal radius and finger. OUTCOMES: 28 (7.4%) Virtual clinic; 137 (36.4%) hospital admission; 193 (51.3%) advice to referring team and discharge; 13 (3.5%) direct discharge by T&O; 4 (1.1%) missing. No. of trauma cases booked: tourists 133 (9%), local population 1415 (91%). CONCLUSIONS: Tourists account for fewer than ten percent of the T&O surgical workload over one year with common injuries being fractures affecting the extremities. Seasonal variation was observed with more referrals occurring in the summer months. Just under half of tourists originated from outside the UK and EU. Health boards should consider increasing resources over the summer months to deal with expected increases in tourist numbers and should be able to recover the cost of treatment from the patient or their travel insurance companies directly at point of care.","Faulkner, Alastair; Harding, Thomas; Miller, Craig; Davies, Peter; McNair, Colin",Surg.

386750,The first year of Covid-19,2021,"Since the 1st case officially confirmed on the last March 2020, Indonesia recorded more than 1000 new cases daily. The national trend shows no sign of decrease as 19 September 2020 the report sets a new mark of 4000 new cases in a day. The concept of controlling disease transmission relies on contacts suppression; and on the longer end, relies on vaccinations. As 27 September 2020, no vaccine is approved for use in the general population. Until then, countries should implement early, widespread, and strict disease mitigation strategies. While much remains to be learned on COVID-19, global evidence assert at least three strategies at the population level contributes to flatten the curve: mobility restriction, testing and isolation and rigorous contact-tracing.Indonesia is not on entire absences of actions, but the epidemic calls for more. The central government called for social distancing two weeks after the first case confirmed and regulation on the large scale social distancing (Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar/ PSBB) that restrict non-essential population mobility is enacted by April 2020. Recent evidence outlines test, tracing and isolation are effective in suppressing COVID-19 transmission. Minimizing testing and tracing delay, less than four days with coverage of 80% close contacts could prevent and reduce onwards transmission.That we need to more is indisputable. The vaccine is not a magic bullet; it is a long-term control measure and should be a complete series of careful and precise examinations. Indonesia will also likely require high coverage of vaccination to achieve herd immunity.

388014,Can Europe tame the pandemic's next wave?,2020,"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and its acute complications. Thus, the study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes hospitalized during the first wave of the pandemic and the prevalence of new onset diabetes among patients with evidence of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A single-center surveillance study included all patients with diabetes admitted to Children's Hospital, Ain Shams University, in Egypt between May to August 2020. Data were collected to evaluate patients' clinical and laboratory characteristics as well as their outcomes. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were admitted during the study period. The mean age was 8.4 ± 3.8 years. Patients presented late to the emergency department with a mean delay of 3.05 ± 1.19 days from onset of symptoms. 34/36 patients presented in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), 50% presenting in severe DKA. Almost 81% of the patients were newly diagnosed. During the study period, SARS-CoV-2 PCR was found positive in four patients, COVID Ig M antibodies were positive in another two patients; all were symptomatic requiring ICU admission. Four patients showed a picture suggestive of the multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C); cardiac affection was a constant feature. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic affected both the prevalence and severity of DKA among pediatric patients. The increased prevalence of severe DKA could be partly related to delayed hospital admission or the effect of COVID-19 in triggering DKA. Efforts should be done to continuously raise awareness about diabetes in children as well as the importance of seeking timely medical guidance.","Sherif, Eman Monir; Elhenawy, Yasmine Ibrahim; Matter, Randa Mahmoud; Aly, Hanan Hassan; Thabet, Rasha Adel; Fereig, Yasmeen Abdelaziz",J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab,,223
388489,Performance Analysis of Scientific Computing Workloads on Trusted Execution Environments,2020-10-25,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) coronavirus is a major public health challenge. Rapid tests for detecting existing SARS-CoV-2 infections and assessing virus spread are critical. Approaches to detect viral RNA based on reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) have potential as simple, scalable, and broadly applicable testing methods. Compared to RT quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)-based methods, RT-LAMP assays require incubation at a constant temperature, thus eliminating the need for sophisticated instrumentation. Here, we tested a two-color RT-LAMP assay protocol for detecting SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA using a primer set specific for the N gene. We tested our RT-LAMP assay on surplus RNA samples isolated from 768 pharyngeal swab specimens collected from individuals being tested for COVID-19. We determined the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Compared to an RT-qPCR assay using a sensitive primer set, we found that the RT-LAMP assay reliably detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA with an RT-qPCR cycle threshold (CT) number of up to 30, with a sensitivity of 97.5% and a specificity of 99.7%. We also developed a swab-to-RT-LAMP assay that did not require a prior RNA isolation step, which retained excellent specificity (99.5%) but showed lower sensitivity (86% for CT < 30) than the RT-LAMP assay. In addition, we developed a multiplexed sequencing protocol (LAMP-sequencing) as a diagnostic validation procedure to detect and record the outcome of RT-LAMP reactions.","Dao Thi, Viet Loan; Herbst, Konrad; Boerner, Kathleen; Meurer, Matthias; Kremer, Lukas Pm; Kirrmaier, Daniel; Freistaedter, Andrew; Papagiannidis, Dimitrios; Galmozzi, Carla; Stanifer, Megan L; Boulant, Steeve; Klein, Steffen; Chlanda, Petr; Khalid, Dina; Barreto Miranda, Isabel; Schnitzler, Paul; Kräusslich, Hans-Georg; Knop, Michael; Anders, Simon",Sci. transl. med,,223

Now COVID-19 has been spread all over the world and declared epidemics by WHO. It has caused a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Due to the rapid increase of SARS-CoV-2 infections and unavailability of antiviral therapeutic agents, developing an effective SAR-CoV-2 vaccine is urgently required. SARS-CoV-2 which is genetically similar to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an enveloped, single and positive-stranded RNA virus with a genome comprising 29,891 nucleotides, which encode the 12 putative open reading frames responsible for the synthesis of viral structural and nonstructural proteins which are very similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV proteins. In this review we have summarized various vaccine candidates i.e., nucleotide, subunit and vector based as well as attenuated and inactivated forms, which have already been demonstrated their prophylactic efficacy against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, so these candidates could be used as a potential tool for the development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Pandey, Satish Chandra; Pande, Veni; Sati, Diksha; Upreti, Shobha; Samant, Mukesh",Life Sci,,223

However, coming into contact with COVID-19-positive patients is unavoidable. Therefore, hand hygiene is of utmost importance for the prevention of COVID-19 among HCWs. This purpose can be achieved by applying alcohol-based hand rubs, washing hands properly with soap and water, and applying other antiseptic agents. Nevertheless, regular hand hygiene could also be challenging, because water, detergents, and disinfectants may predispose HCWs to hand dermatitis. The current article reviews the risk factors for the development of hand dermatitis, with further focus on the most common agents used among HCWs. In addition, the risk of occupational hand dermatitis for each agent is evaluated to increase awareness of this common condition. Finally, some recommendations are discussed to reduce the effect of hand dermatitis on HCWs.","Araghi, Farnaz; Tabary, Mohammadreza; Gheisari, Mehdi; Abdollahimajd, Fahimeh; Dadkhahfar, Sahar",Dermatitis,,223

390803,Acts of self-preservation,2021,"Three vaccines are recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for routine vaccination of adolescents aged 11-12 years to protect against 1) pertussis; 2) meningococcal disease caused by types A, C, W, and Y; and 3) human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers (1). At age 16 years, a booster dose of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) is recommended. Persons aged 16-23 years can receive serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB), if determined to be appropriate through shared clinical decision-making. CDC analyzed data from the 2019 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen) to estimate vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13-17 years in the United States.* Coverage with &#8805;1 dose of HPV vaccine increased from 68.1% in 2018 to 71.5% in 2019, and the percentage of adolescents who were up to date with the HPV vaccination series (HPV UTD) increased from 51.1% in 2018 to 54.2% in 2019. Both HPV vaccination coverage measures improved among females and males. An increase in adolescent coverage with &#8805;1 dose of MenACWY (from 86.6% in 2018 to 88.9% in 2019) also was observed. Among adolescents aged 17 years, 53.7% received the booster dose of MenACWY in 2019, not statistically different from 50.8% in 2018; 21.8% received &#8805;1 dose of MenB, a 4.6 percentage point increase from 17.2% in 2018. Among adolescents living at or above the poverty level,§ those living outside a metropolitan statistical area (MSA)¶ had lower coverage with &#8805;1 dose of MenACWY and with &#8805;1 HPV vaccine dose, and a lower percentage were HPV UTD, compared with those living in MSA principal cities. In early 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic changed the way health care providers operate and provide routine and essential services. An examination of Vaccines for Children (VFC) provider ordering data showed that vaccine orders for HPV vaccine; tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap); and MenACWY decreased in mid-March when COVID-19 was declared a national emergency (Supplementary Figure 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/91795).

Additionally, heterogeneous data regarding clinical indicators predicting disease severity has been published. However, there is a need for a risk stratification model integrating the effects on disease severity and mortality to support clinical decision-making. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, observational, prospective, epidemiological cohort study at 45 hospitals in Germany. Until 1 January 2021, all hospitalized SARS CoV-2 positive patients were included. A comprehensive data set was collected in a cohort of seven hospitals. The primary objective was disease severity and prediction of mild, severe, and fatal cases. Ancillary analyses included a temporal analysis of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients for the entire year 2020. FINDINGS: A total of 4704 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized with a mortality rate of 19% (890/4704). Rates of mortality, need for ventilation, pneumonia, and respiratory insufficiency showed temporal variations, whereas age had a strong influence on the course of mortality. In cohort conducting analyses, prognostic factors for fatal/severe disease were: age (odds ratio (OR) 1.704, CI:[1.221-2.377]), respiratory rate (OR 1.688, CI:[1.222-2.333]), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (OR 1.312, CI:[1.015-1.695]), C-reactive protein (CRP) (OR 2.132, CI:[1.533-2.965]), and creatinine values (OR 2.573, CI:[1.593-4.154]. CONCLUSIONS: Age, respiratory rate, LDH, CRP, and creatinine at baseline are associated with all cause death, and need for ventilation/ICU treatment in a nationwide series of COVID 19 hospitalized patients. Especially age plays an important prognostic role. In-hospital mortality showed temporal variation during the year 2020, influenced by age.

392697,Life Imitates Art: The Physician in a Time of Plague,2020,"Aging is the primary risk factor for functional decline; thus, understanding and preventing disability among older adults has emerged as an important public health challenge of the 21st century. The science of gerontology - or geroscience - has the practical purpose of ""adding life to the years."" The overall goal of geroscience is to increase healthspan, which refers to extending the portion of the lifespan in which the individual experiences enjoyment, satisfaction, and wellness. An important facet of this goal is preserving mobility, defined as the ability to move independently. Despite this clear purpose, this has proven to be a challenging endeavor as mobility and function in later life are influenced by a complex interaction of factors across multiple domains. Moreover, findings over the past decade have highlighted the complexity of walking and how targeting multiple systems, including the brain and sensory organs, as well as the environment in which a person lives, can have a dramatic effect on an older person's mobility and function. For these reasons, behavioral interventions that incorporate complex walking tasks and other activities of daily living appear to be especially helpful for improving mobility function. Other pharmaceutical interventions, such as oxytocin, and complementary and alternative interventions, such as massage therapy, may enhance physical function both through direct effects on biological mechanisms related to mobility, as well as indirectly through modulation of cognitive and socioemotional processes. Thus, the purpose of the present review is to describe evolving interventional approaches to enhance mobility and maintain healthspan in the growing population of older adults in the United States and countries throughout the world. Such interventions are likely to be greatly assisted by technological advances and the widespread adoption of virtual communications during and after the COVID-19 era.","Anton, Stephen D; Cruz-Almeida, Yenisel; Singh, Arashdeep; Alpert, Jordan; Bensadon, Benjamin; Cabrera, Melanie; Clark, David J; Ebner, Natalie C; Esser, Karyn A; Fillingim, Roger B; Goicolea, Soamy Montesino; Han, Sung Min; Kallas, Henrique; Johnson, Alisa; Leeuwenburgh, Christiaan; Liu, Andrew C; Manini, Todd M; Marsiske, Michael; Moore, Frederick; Qiu, Peihua; Mankowski, Robert T; Mardini, Mamoun; McLaren, Christian; Ranka, Sanjay; Rashidi, Parisa; Saini, Sunil; Sibille, Kimberly T; Someya, Shinichi; Wohlgemuth, Stephanie; Tucker, Carolyn; Xiao, Rui; Pahor, Marco",Exp Gerontol,,223

Methods: Based on the epidemic data of COVID-19 openly accessed from national health authorities, we estimated the dynamic basic reproduction number R(0)(t) to evaluate the effects of the current COVID-19 prevention and control strategies in all the provinces (municipalities and autonomous regions) as well as in Wuhan and the changes in infectivity of COVID-19 over time. Results: For the stability of the results, 24 provinces (municipality) with more than 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases were included in the analysis. At the beginning of the outbreak, the R(0)(t) showed unstable trend with big variances. As the strengthening of the prevention and control strategies, R(0)(t) began to show a downward trend in late January, and became stable in February. By the time of data analysis, 18 provinces (municipality) (75%) had the R(0)(t)s less than 1. The results could be used for the decision making to free population floating conditionally. Conclusions: Dynamic R(0)(t) is useful in the evaluation of the change in infectivity of COVID-19, the prevention and control strategies for the COVID-19 outbreak have shown preliminary effects, if continues, it is expected to control the COVID-19 outbreak in China in near future.","Huang, L L; Shen, S P; Yu, P; Wei, Y Y",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,223

As educators make the transition to virtual classrooms, it is paramount that core practices, such as the interactive read‐aloud, are intentionally adapted to ensure that their purpose remains central to their use. Although the production of digital read‐alouds has flourished during the recent pandemic, many of these videos lack key components necessary to foster meaningful literacy growth. Educators need to be aware of the affordances and limitations offered by digital read‐alouds to analyze and create materials for classroom use. In this article, we offer resources to guide intentional planning to ensure that digital read‐aloud experiences go beyond passive student consumption. In addition, specific recommendations illustrate how digital read‐alouds can be positioned within synchronous and asynchronous classroom activities to preserve and amplify the sociocultural element that can be more challenging to maintain within virtual environments.

Richard Bucala,2021,"We report detailed peptide-binding affinities between 438 HLA Class I and Class II proteins and complete proteomes of seven pandemic human viruses, including coronaviruses, influenza viruses and HIV-1. We contrast these affinities with HLA allele frequencies across hundreds of human populations worldwide. Statistical modelling shows that peptide-binding affinities classified into four distinct categories depend on the HLA locus but that the type of virus is only a weak predictor, except in the case of HIV-1. Among the strong HLA binders (IC50 &#8804; 50), we uncovered 16 alleles (the top ones being A*02:02, B*15:03 and DRB1*01:02) binding more than 1% of peptides derived from all viruses, 9 (top ones including HLA-A*68:01, B*15:25, C*03:02 and DRB1*07:01) binding all viruses except HIV-1, and 15 (top ones A*02:01 and C*14:02) only binding coronaviruses. The frequencies of strongest and weakest HLA peptide binders differ significantly among populations from different geographic regions. In particular, Indigenous peoples of America show both higher frequencies of strongest and lower frequencies of weakest HLA binders. As many HLA proteins are found to be strong binders of peptides derived from distinct viral families, and are hence promiscuous (or generalist), we discuss this result in relation to possible signatures of natural selection on HLA promiscuous alleles due to past pathogenic infections. Our findings are highly relevant for both evolutionary genetics and the development of vaccine therapies. However they should not lead to forget that individual resistance and vulnerability to diseases go beyond the sole HLA allelic affinity and depend on multiple, complex and often unknown biological, environmental and other variables.","Barquera, Rodrigo; Collen, Evelyn; Di, Da; Buhler, Stéphane; Teixeira, João; Llamas, Bastien; Nunes, José M; Sanchez-Mazas, Alicia",HLA,,223

While novel vaccines and drugs that target SARS-CoV-2 are under development, this review provides information on therapeutics which are under clinical trials or are proposed to antagonize SARS-CoV-2. Based on the information gained from the responses to other RNA coronaviruses, including the strains that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronaviruses and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), drug repurposing might be a viable strategy. Since several antiviral therapies can inhibit viral replication cycles or relieve symptoms, mechanisms unique to RNA viruses will be important for the clinical development of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Given that several currently marketed drugs may be efficient therapeutic agents for severe COVID-19 cases, they may be beneficial for future viral pandemics and other infections caused by RNA viruses when standard treatments are unavailable.","Asai, Ayumu; Konno, Masamitsu; Ozaki, Miyuki; Otsuka, Chihiro; Vecchione, Andrea; Arai, Takahiro; Kitagawa, Toru; Ofusa, Ken; Yabumoto, Masami; Hirotsu, Takaaki; Taniguchi, Masateru; Eguchi, Hidetoshi; Doki, Yuichiro; Ishii, Hideshi",,,223
396075,Loneliness: A new phenomenon in our modern-day society?,2020,"Risk and response communication of public agencies through social media played a significant role in the emergence and spread of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) and such interactions were echoed in other information outlets.

The scope of the work includes a detailed understanding of how agencies communicate risk information through social media during a pandemic and influence community response (i.e. timing of lockdown, timing of reopening) and disease outbreak indicators (i.e. number of confirmed cases, number of deaths). The data includes Twitter interactions from different agencies (2.15K tweets per agency on average) and crowdsourced data (i.e. Worldometer) on COVID-19 cases and deaths were observed between February 21, 2020 and June 06, 2020. Several machine learning techniques such as (i.e. topic mining and sentiment ratings over time) are applied here to identify the dynamics of emergent topics during this unprecedented time. Temporal infographics of the results captured the agency-levels variations over time in circulating information about the importance of face covering, home quarantine, social distancing and contact tracing. In addition, agencies showed differences in their discussions about community transmission, lack of personal protective equipment, testing and medical supplies, use of tobacco, vaccine, mental health issues, hospitalization, hurricane season, airports, construction work among others.

Hierarchical logistic regression analysis results showed that dysfunctional personality domains and non-scientifically supported causal beliefs explained all the variance that was originally explained by demographic variables (i.e., age and gender). In particular, negative affectivity and detachment represented relevant risk factors for reduced emotional well-being in our sample. A significant positive association was observed also between emotional problems and supernatural causal beliefs on the COVID-19 infection. Our data supported the importance of considering the impact of quarantine measures on psychological well-being, while suggesting possible risk factors related to individual differences in personality and causal beliefs.","Somma, Antonella; Gialdi, Giulia; Krueger, Robert F; Markon, Kristian E; Frau, Claudia; Lovallo, Silvia; Fossati, Andrea",Pers Individ Dif,,223

A distinction was made between urgent procedures: any trauma repairment, trabeculectomy/drainage implant for glaucoma, any operation for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) repair, pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for vitreous hemorrhage (VH), macular hole, or retained lens fragments; elective procedures: corneal transplant, phacoemulsification for cataract extraction, silicone oil removal, and PPV for epiretinal membrane; and intravitreal injections (either anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] or dexamethasone) to treat exudative maculopathies. The main outcome measure was the rate of reduction in urgent and elective surgeries performed. RESULTS: Overall, 3624 and 844 surgical procedures were performed from 10 March to 9 April 2019 and from 10 March to 10 April 2020, respectively (-76.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, p < 0.0001). Urgent and elective surgical procedures and intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF drugs or dexamethasone reduced significantly in 2020 in comparison to 2019 (p < 0.0001 for urgent and elective surgeries and 0.01 for intravitreal injections). CONCLUSION: A significant reduction in the rate of urgent and elective surgeries and intravitreal injections was recorded during the first month of lockdown compared to the same period in 2019. With this analysis, the authors hope to provide some preliminary insights about the consequences of lockdown for the eyecare system in Italy.","dell039,; Omo, Roberto; Filippelli, Mariaelena; Semeraro, Francesco; Avitabile, Teresio; Giansanti, Fabrizio; Parmeggiani, Francesco; Romano, Mario R; Strianese, Diego; Romano, Vito; Virgili, Gianni; Costagliola, Ciro",Eur J Ophthalmol,,223
396541,"The Virus, the Settler, and the Siege: Gaza in the Age of Corona",2020,"For the assessment of vaccine-induced immune response and to understand the role of antibodies in neutralization, it is necessary to assess dynamics of various antibodies in patients with different clinical manifestations. This study aims to quantitate circulating levels of IgA/IgG and IgG subtypes induced at different days postonset of symptoms, in severe and nonsevere patients. For this, serum or plasma samples (n = 146) collected from 79 COVID-19 patients were used. Indirect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific IgA, IgG, and IgG subtype specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed. Antibody titers between severe and nonsevere patients were compared at different times postonset of clinical symptoms. Titers in ELISA were compared to neutralizing antibody (Nab) titers determined by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Over 75% patients were positive for IgA/IgG antibodies in the first week. The ELISA titers did not differ during the first week; however, severe disease exhibited raised titers thereafter. Nab titers correlated with the ELISA titers in mild presentation but not in severe disease. IgA and IgG1 antibodies correlated stronger with Nabs. The findings highlighted that IgA together with IgG play an important in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. These results will prove useful in assessing efficacy of vaccines and understanding disease pathogenesis.","Patil, Harshad P; Rane, Prajakta S; Shrivastava, Shubham; Palkar, Sonali; Lalwani, Sanjay; Mishra, Akhilesh C; Arankalle, Vidya A",Viral Immunol,,223

398812,An ASP-based Solution to the Chemotherapy Treatment Scheduling problem,2021-08-05,"BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 12,322,000 people and killed over 556,000 people worldwide. However, Differential diagnosis remains difficult for suspected cases of COVID-19 and need to be improved to reduce misdiagnosis. METHODS: Sixty-eight cases of suspected COVID-19 treated in Wenzhou Central Hospital from January 21 to February 20, 2020 were divided into confirmed and COVID-19-negative groups based on the results of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nucleic acid testing of the novel coronavirus in throat swab specimens to compare the clinical symptoms and laboratory and imaging results between the groups. RESULTS: Among suspected patients, 17 were confirmed to COVID-19-positive group and 51 were distinguished to COVID-19-negative group. Patients with reduced white blood cell (WBC) count were more common in the COVID-19-positive group than in the COVID-19-negative group (29.4% vs 3.9%, P = 0.003). Subsequently, correlation analysis indicated that there was a significant inverse correlation existed between WBC count and temperature in the COVID-19-positive patients (r = - 0.587, P = 0.003), instead of the COVID-19-negative group. But reduced lymphocyte count was no different between the two groups (47.1% vs 25.5%, P = 0.096). More common chest imaging characteristics of the confirmed COVID-19 cases by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) included ground-glass opacities (GGOs), multiple patchy shadows, and consolidation with bilateral involvement than COVID-19-negative group (82.4% vs 31.4%, P = 0.0002; 41.2% vs 17.6% vs P = 0.048; 76.5% vs 43.1%, P = 0.017; respectively). The rate of clustered infection was higher in COVID-19-positive group than COVID-19-negative group (64.7% vs 7.8%, P = 0.001). Through multiplex PCR nucleic acid testing, 2 cases of influenza A, 3 cases of influenza B, 2 cases of adenovirus, 2 cases of Chlamydia pneumonia, and 7 cases of Mycoplasma pneumoniae were diagnosed in the COVID-19-negative group. CONCLUSIONS: WBC count inversely correlated with the severity of fever, GGOs, multiple patchy shadows, and consolidation in chest HRCT and clustered infection are common but not specific features in the confirmed COVID-19 group. Multiplex PCR nucleic acid testing helped differential diagnosis for suspected COVID-19 cases.","Chi, Qiong; Dai, Xinjian; Jiang, Xiangao; Zhu, Lefei; Du, Junyan; Chen, Yuxi; Zheng, Jiyang; Huang, Jianping",BMC Infect Dis,,223
399880,From the Editor,2020,"AIM: To assess the impact of liver function test (LFT) abnormalities on the prognosis of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a French cohort of hospitalized patients. PATIENTS AND METHOD: From March 13 to April 22, 2020, we collected on a computerized and anonymized database, medical records, laboratory data and clinical outcomes of patients hospitalized for confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection (RT-PCR and/or CT-scan). Patients were followed up until April 22, 2020 or until death or discharge. We have considered for statistical analysis, LFT abnormalities with levels greater than two times the upper limit of normal. Composite endpoint included admission to ICU, mechanical ventilation, severe radiologic injury and death to define disease severity. RESULTS: Among 281 patients (median age 60 years) with COVID-19, 102 (36.3%) had abnormal LFT. Hypertension (45.6%) and diabetes (29.5%) were the main comorbidities. 20.2% were taken liver-toxic drugs at the admission and 27.4% were given drugs known to induce hepatic cytolysis during hospitalization. Patients with elevated levels of ALT or AST were significantly more severe with a higher rate of admission to ICU (40.0% vs 6.0%, pâ¯<â¯ 0.0001), and global mortality (26.7% vs 12.1%, pâ¯=â¯ 0.03). In multivariate analysis, obesity and cytolytic profil were associated with the composite endpoint (respectively 2.37 [1.21; 4.64], pâ¯=â¯ 0.01 and OR 6.20, 95% confidence interval [1.84, 20.95], p-value 0.003) CONCLUSION: Most of liver injuries are mild and transient during COVID-19. LFT abnormalities are associated with a poorer prognosis and could be a relevant biomarker for early detection of severe infection.","Chaibi, Sayma; Boussier, Jeremy; Hajj, Weam El; Abitbol, Yael; Taieb, Sarah; Horaist, Clemence; Jouannaud, Vincent; Wang, Pascal; Piquet, Jacques; Maurer, Cyril; Lahmek, Pierre; Nahon, Stéphane",Clin. res. hepatol. gastroenterol,,223

Quercetin (Q), a bioflavonoid, at 0.3% concentration has showed some wound healing potential in our preliminary studies. The present study was aimed to explore the wound healing potential of 0.3% quercetin formulated in 3 different vehicles, that is, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; 10%), ointment base, and corn oil. Ninety experimentally wounded rats were grouped in 6 groups. The 0.3% quercetin mixed with DMSO, ointment base, and corn oil was topically applied once daily for 21 days on the wounds of groups 2, 4, and 6, respectively. DMSO, ointment base, and corn oil alone was applied similarly in groups 1, 3, and 5, respectively. Gross evaluation and wound contraction results revealed accelerated wound closure in all quercetin-treated groups. The mRNA expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor-ß1, and interluekin-10 were markedly upregulated in healing tissues of quercetin-treated groups. Tumor necrosis factor-&#945; mRNA expression and protein levels were lowered by quercetin treatment. Quercetin-treated groups also showed increased activities of SOD (superoxide dismutase) and catalase, and levels of total thiols in wound tissues on day 7. Levels of superoxide anion radicals and malondialdehyde were markedly lower in quercetin-treated groups. Histologically, wound sections of quercetin-treated groups showed early dominance of fibroblasts, increased blood vessels, marked collagen deposition, and regenerated epithelial layer. The significant effects were more pronounced in ointment + Q group among all the quercetin-treated groups. In conclusion, 0.3% quercetin mixed in ointment base produced the fastest and better wound healing in rats.","Kant, Vinay; Kumar, Manish; Jangir, Babu Lal; Kumar, Vinod",Int J Low Extrem Wounds,,223

The mechanisms through which the virus leads to anosmia/hyposmia is still not fully understood. However, olfaction changes could be used as an indication for testing or quarantine. Screening for infections and other diseases by recognizing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) has been previously conducted. Hence, if the coronavirus infection also results in VOCs excretion, physicians could ""smell"" the virus by using electronic noses. We conducted a literature review on olfaction changes and the COVID-19. Our results suggest that these changes could be used an indication for early testing, even as an isolated symptom. We propose that the electronic nose be used as a future screening tool, especially in agglomeration spaces such as airports, for screening for the COVID-19 infection.","David, Paula; Shoenfeld, Yehuda",Isr Med Assoc J,,223

Donor recipient body weight ratio (D/R ratio) was identified as one of the main variables related with the success to achieve the target cell dose for transplantation. According to this variable we modified the mobilization schedule. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We report the results of 46 mobilizations and apheresis procedures performed in our center with unfavorable D/R ratio. Mobilization was attempted by the standard regime of G-CSF (10 mcg/kg/24 hours) in 28 cases (60.9%), with high dose G-CSF (10 mcg/kg/12 hours) in 9 cases (19.6%), and with plerixafor and G-CSF single dose regime in 9 cases (19.6%). RESULTS: CD34+ cell quantification before apheresis is closely related to CD34+ yield, being the only factor related to collected CD34+ cells (beta .71; P < .0001). The mobilization efficiency was higher in plerixafor group compared to the other two schedules (P < .0001). By using plerixafor for mobilization, we achieved the target CD34+ cell dose of &#8805;2 × 106 /kg per recipient body weight in all cases with unfavorable D/R ratio. It was observed that 17.4% of cases that not reached the established target cell dose were located in the standard or high-dose mobilization regimes. This difference is even greater for optimal collections (&#8805;5 × 106 /kg), since of the 54.3% cases that did not reach this goal none was mobilized by plerixafor. CONCLUSION: Tailoring the mobilization regime we can reach the target cell dose, even in those cases with the worst D/R ratio.","Zubicaray, Josune; Galvez, Eva; Sebastian, Elena; Molina, Blanca; González-Vicent, Marta; Castillo, Ana; Ramírez, Manuel; Madero, Luis; Díaz, Miguel Angel; Sevilla, Julian",,,223

406276,Europäische Währungsunion: schlecht gerüstet für große Krisen,2021,"ABSTRACT: The impact of COVID-19, on the health and safety of patients, staff, and healthcare organizations, has yet to be fully uncovered. Patient adverse events, such as hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs), have been problematic for decades. The introduction of a pandemic to an environment that is potentially at-risk for adverse events may result in unintended patient safety and quality concerns. We use the learning health system framework to motivate our understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of HAPIs within our health system. Using a retrospective, observational design, we used descriptive statistics to evaluate trends in HAPI from March to July 2020. Hospital-acquired pressure injury numbers have fluctuated from a steady increase from March-May 2020, hitting a peak high of 90 cases in the month of May. However, the trend in the total all stage HAPIs began to decline in June 2020, with a low of 51 in July, the lowest number since March 2020. Patients evaluated in this study did not have a longitudinal increase in HAPIs from March-July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite similarities in illness severity between the two time points. Our experience has demonstrated the ability of our organizational leaders to learn quickly during crisis.","Polancich, Shea; Hall, Allyson G; Miltner, Rebecca; Poe, Terri; Enogela, Ene M; Montgomery, Aoyjai P; Patrician, Patricia A",J Healthc Qual,,223

406581,A Gaussian Beam Based Recursive Stiffness Matrix Model to Simulate Ultrasonic Array Signals from Multi-Layered Media,2020,"The vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) is a haematophagous animal that feeds exclusively on the blood of domestic mammals. Vampire bat feeding habits enable their contact with mammalian hosts and may enhance zoonotic spillover. Moreover, they may carry several pathogenic organisms, including coronaviruses (CoVs), for which they are important hosts. The human pathogens that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and possibly coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) all originated in bats but required bridge hosts to spread into human populations. To monitor the presence of potential zoonotic viruses in bats, the present work evaluated the presence of CoVs in vampire bats from southern Brazil. A total of 101 vampire bats were captured and euthanized between 2017 and 2019 in Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil. The brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys and intestines were collected and macerated individually. The samples were pooled and submitted to high-throughput sequencing (HTS) using the Illumina MiSeq platform and subsequently individually screened using a pancoronavirus RT-PCR protocol. We detected CoV-related sequences in HTS, but only two (2/101; 1.98%) animals had CoV detected in the intestines by RT-PCR. Partial sequences of RdRp and spike genes were obtained in the same sample and the RdRp region in the other sample. The sequences were classified as belonging to Alphacoronavirus. The sequences were closely related to alphacoronaviruses detected in vampire bats from Peru. The continuous monitoring of bat CoVs may help to map and predict putative future zoonotic agents with great impacts on human health.","Alves, Raquel Silva; do Canto Olegário, Juliana; Weber, Matheus Nunes; da Silva, Mariana Soares; Canova, Raissa; Sauthier, Jéssica Tatiane; Baumbach, Letícia Ferreira; Witt, André Alberto; Varela, Ana Paula Muterle; Mayer, Fabiana Quoos; da Fontoura Budaszewski, Renata; Canal, Cláudio Wageck",Transbound. emerg. dis.

The manifestation of mucormycosis largely depends on the presence of exposure to the pathogen and the existing risk factor of the host.

Administration of antihistamines increased survival up to 85%-95%. Immunohistochemical examination using CD117 staining of the lungs demonstrated a larger quantity of activated mast cells after infection of immunized mice compared to mock-immunized mice. This was correlated to increased histamine level in the lungs and blood. Our experimental results suggest the involvement of mast cells and the histamine they produce in the pathogenesis of influenza infection in case of incomplete formation of the immune response to vaccination and mismatch of the vaccine and infection influenza viruses.","Desheva, Yulia; Mamontov, Andrey; Petkova, Nadezhda; Karev, Vadim; Nazarov, Peter",Life Sci,,223

METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. FINDINGS: Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts [0·6 (0·6-0·8)] but increases in neutrophil counts [4·7 (3·6-5·8)] than 27 mild cases [1.1 (0·8-1·4); 2·0 (1·5-2·9)]. Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-Î³ levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases. Moreover, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (AUC=0·93) and neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio (N8R) (AUC =0·94) were identified as powerful prognostic factors affecting the prognosis for severe COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: The degree of lymphopenia and a proinflammatory cytokine storm is higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild cases, and is associated with the disease severity. N8R and NLR may serve as a useful prognostic factor for early identification of severe COVID-19 cases.

To implement vaccination and immunization programs effectively, it is essential to investigate public attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. This study examined the attitudes of Chinese college students toward COVID-19 vaccines and their associated factors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in college students nationwide from December 27, 2020 to January 18, 2021. Attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines and acceptance of future vaccination programs were assessed. Results: Totally, 2,881 college students participated in this survey; of them, 76.3% (95% CI: 74.8% - 77.9%) were willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine in the future. Multiple logistic analysis revealed that students living in urban (OR=1.409, 95% CI: 1.152 - 1.724, p=0.001) and those studying health-related courses (OR=1.581, 95% CI: 1.291 - 1.935, p<0.001) were more likely to have a positive attitude toward COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, those who were worried about being infected with COVID-19 (very much vs no, OR=1.690, 95% CI: 1.212-2.356, p=0.002), heard previously about COVID-19 vaccines (OR=1.659, 95% CI: 1.268-2.170, p<0.001), believed that vaccines are safe (Yes vs No, OR=3.570, 95% CI: 1.825-6.980), thought that vaccines can protect people from being infected with COVID-19 (Yes vs No, OR=1.957, 95% CI: 1.286-2.979, p=0.002), and had encouraged their family and friends to have a vaccine (Yes vs No, OR=17.745, 95% CI: 12.271-25.660, p<0.001) had higher acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusions: A high rate of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines was found among Chinese college students. However, vaccine uptake may be reduced by concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy. Alleviating these concerns and enhancing public confidence in vaccines are crucial for future immunization programs against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bai, Wei; Cai, Hong; Liu, Shou; Liu, Huanzhong; Qi, Han; Chen, Xu; Liu, Rui; Cheung, Teris; Su, Zhaohui; Ng, Chee H; Xiang, Yu-Tao",Int J Biol Sci,,223
410134,Culinary trends: How the coronavirus will change menus,2020,"This paper develops a two-level fourth-order scheme for solving time-fractional convection-diffusion-reaction equation with variable coefficients subjected to suitable initial and boundary conditions. The basis properties of the new approach are investigated and both stability and error estimates of the proposed numerical scheme are deeply analyzed in the $L^{\infty}(0,T;L^{2})$-norm. The theory indicates that the method is unconditionally stable with convergence of order $O(k^{2-\frac{\lambda}{2}}+h^{4})$, where $k$ and $h$ are time step and mesh size, respectively, and $\lambda\in(0,1)$. This result suggests that the two-level fourth-order technique is more efficient than a large class of numerical techniques widely studied in the literature for the considered problem. Some numerical evidences are provided to verify the unconditional stability and convergence rate of the proposed algorithm.","Ngondiep, Eric",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.06260v1.pdf,223

412697,Conservation Leadership Programme 2020 Team Awards announced,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains a global challenge. Corticosteroids constitute a group of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs that are widely used in the treatment of COVID-19. Comprehensive reviews investigating the comparative proportion and efficacy of corticosteroid use are scarce. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials to evaluate the proportion and efficacy of corticosteroid use for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature review and meta-analysis of research articles, including observational studies and clinical trials, by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry, and China Academic Journal Network Publishing databases. Patients treated between December 1, 2019, and January 1, 2021, were included. The outcome measures were the proportion of patients treated with corticosteroids, viral clearance and mortality. The effect size with the associated 95% confidence interval is reported as the weighted mean difference for continuous outcomes and the odds ratio for dichotomous outcomes. RESULTS: Fifty-two trials involving 15710 patients were included. The meta-analysis demonstrated that the proportion of COVID-19 patients who received corticosteroids was significantly lower than that of patients who did not receive corticosteroids (35.19% vs. 64.49%). In addition, our meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference in the proportions of severe and nonsevere cases treated with corticosteroids (27.91% vs. 20.91%). We also performed subgroup analyses stratified by whether patients stayed in the intensive care unit (ICU) and found that the proportion of patients who received corticosteroids was significantly higher among those who stayed in the ICU than among those who did not. The results of our meta-analysis indicate that corticosteroid treatment significantly delayed the viral clearance time. Finally, our meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference in the use of corticosteroids for COVID-19 between patients who died and those who survived. This result indicates that mortality is not correlated with corticosteroid therapy. CONCLUSION: The proportion of COVID-19 patients who received corticosteroids was significantly lower than that of patients who did not receive corticosteroids. Corticosteroid use in subjects with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections delayed viral clearance and did not convincingly improve survival; therefore, corticosteroids should be used with extreme caution in the treatment of COVID-19.","Wang, Junning; Yang, Weixia; Chen, Puwen; Guo, Jianbin; Liu, Rui; Wen, Pengfei; Li, Kun; Lu, Yao; Ma, Tao; Li, Xiaoli; Qin, Siqing; Zhang, Yumin; Wang, Yakang",PLoS One,,223
412955,Efficient network immunization under limited knowledge,2020-04-02,"Background: In a year-long pneumonia etiology study conducted June 2017 to May 2018 in Sarawak, Malaysia, 599 patients' nasopharyngeal swab specimens were studied with real-time polymerase chain reaction (rPCR)/ reverse-transcription (rRT-PCR) assays for respiratory pathogens known to contribute to the high burden of lower respiratory tract infections. The study team sought to compare real-time assay results with panspecies conventional molecular diagnostics to compare sensitivities and learn if novel viruses had been missed. Methods: Specimens were studied for evidence of adenovirus (AdV), enterovirus (EV) and coronavirus (CoV) with panspecies gel-based nested PCR/RT-PCR assays. Gene sequences of specimens positive by panspecies assays were sequenced and studied with the NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool software. Results: There was considerable discordance between real-time and conventional molecular methods. The real-time AdV assay found a positivity of 10.4%; however, the AdV panspecies assay detected a positivity of 12.4% and the conventional AdV-Hexon assay detected a positivity of 19.6%. The CoV and EV panspecies assays similarly detected more positive specimens than the real-time assays, with a positivity of 7.8% by the CoV panspecies assay versus 4.2% by rRT-PCR, and 8.0% by the EV panspecies assay versus 1.0% by rRT-PCR. We were not able to ascertain virus viability in this setting. While most discordance was likely due to assay sensitivity for previously described human viruses, two novel, possible zoonotic AdV were detected. Conclusions: The observed differences in the two modes of amplification suggest that where a problem with sensitivity is suspected, real-time assay results might be supplemented with panspecies conventional PCR/RT-PCR assays.","Fieldhouse, Jane K; Bailey, Emily S; Toh, Teck-Hock; Hii, King-Ching; Mallinson, Kerry A; Ting, Jakie; Lednicky, John A; Berita, Antoinette; Nguyen, Tham Thi; Galan, Diego; Than, Son T; Wong, See-Chang; Wong, Toh-Mee; Blair, Patrick J; Gray, Gregory C",Trop Dis Travel Med Vaccines,,223
414092,Will Coronavirus and Economic Nationalism Reverse Two Centuries of Globalization?,2020,"In March 2020, COVID-19 appeared in the State of Maryland, resulting in strict stay-at-home orders and the shutting down of physical business operations. These restrictions directly impacted College Park Academy (CPA), a public charter middle and high school in Prince George's County, MD that typically follows a hybrid approach to in-person and online instruction. The purpose of this qualitative study was to review CPA's transition to full online distance learning during emergency remote teaching. The research worked to establish a snapshot of the school's underlying structure and disaster preparedness strategies before evaluating the perceived viability of the online model and its effects on students, teachers, parents, and educational administrators. The researchers conducted interviews, as well as document analysis and online classroom observations. The findings reveal that despite strong infrastructure and communications during the transition, there remained issues with school readiness, including the maintenance of academic rigor and social emotional wellbeing. Overall, recommendations are made as to how the school would benefit from a shift in its approach to technology-enhanced learning, including the need for digital tools that better facilitate wellness checks, provide human touchpoints, and target collaborative, student-centered pedagogy. These lessons learned are relevant for other school administrators to consider as society continues to adapt to a new era of virtual learning during times of crisis.","Williams, Kate Maloney; Corwith, Anne",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,223

Stinnesbeck",2021,"AIM: To assess the effectiveness of the use of the antiviral drug enisamium iodide in the complex treatment of acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI) caused by various pathogens in routine clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ð prospective randomized study included 134 patients who were treated in the epidemic season of influenza and ARVI in 20182019. All patients were examined for the presence of influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses in nasopharyngeal swabs by PCR. Patients of the main group received enisamium iodide along with symptomatic therapy, the control group received only symptomatic therapy. The primary parameter of the effectiveness of therapy was evaluated on the scale of the general severity of the manifestations of ARVI (Total Symptom Score TSS) from the 2nd to the 4th day and by the secondary criteria of effectiveness: assessment of the duration of ARVI, the severity of fever, the proportion of patients with normal body temperature, the duration of the main clinical symptoms of acute respiratory viral infections, the proportion of patients in whom complications requiring antibiotics were noted, the dynamics of interferon status on the 6th day. To conduct a statistical analysis, depending on the efficiency parameter, the ANCOVA method with a fixed group factor and an initial score on the TSS severity scale was used as covariates, a criterion for comparing quantitative indicators in two independent groups. RESULTS: According to the results of the analysis of the primary efficacy parameter, the median (interquartile range) of the average score on the scale of the general severity of ARVI manifestations in the main group was 4.33 (3.675.83), in the comparison group 6.00 (4.677.25; p0.001). The duration of systemic and local manifestations of acute respiratory viral infections was statistically significantly less in the main group (p=0.002 and p=0.019, respectively). Prescription of additional therapy was required in 2 (2.9%) patients of the main group (patients taking enisamium iodide), compared with 8 (11.9%) patients in the control group. Serum levels of interferon ï¡ and interferon ï£ on the last day of treatment were statistically significantly higher in patients of the main group compared with the control group (p0.001). Treatment (excellent) was evaluated by 42 (62.7%) patients, while in the control group only 17 (25.8%) patients gave similar ratings. Both patients (p0.001) and doctors (p0.002) rated therapy tolerance better in the study group. CONCLUSION: The results confirmed the safety and effectiveness of enisamium iodide as a treatment for ARVI and influenza. The antiviral, interferonogenic and anti-inflammatory properties of the drug are involved in the formation of an antiviral response and reduce the risk of complications, which makes it possible to reduce the number of symptomatic agents used.","Lioznov, D A; Karnaukhova, E J; Zubkova, T G; Shakhlanskaya, E V",Ter Arkh,,223

Then, through the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genome and Genome (KEGG) pathway and biological process (BP) analysis, we found that the upregulated and downregulated DEGs were abundant in different pathways, respectively. It was noteworthy that upregulated DEGs were the most significantly enriched in the mTOR signaling pathway. Subsequently, through the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, we identified seven hub genes, namely, EXOSC2, CAMK2A, PRIM1, SMC4, TYMS, CDK6, and RPA2. Finally, through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we obtained that hypoxia, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, hedgehog signaling, and reactive oxygen species pathway were the enriched pathways for MDD patients.

The cause of the syndrome was a new type of coronavirus isolated on January 7th 2020 and named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since January 2020 an ever increasing number of scientific works related to the new pathogen have appeared in literature. Identifying relevant research outcomes at very early stages is challenging. In this work we use COVID-19 as a use-case for investigating: (1) which tools and frameworks are mostly used for early scholarly communication; (2) to what extent altmetrics can be used to identify potential impactful research in tight (i.e. quasi-zero-day) time-windows. A literature review with rigorous eligibility criteria is performed for gathering a sample composed of scientific papers about SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 appeared in literature in the tight time-window ranging from January 15th 2020 to February 24th 2020. This sample is used for building a knowledge graph that represents the knowledge about papers and indicators formally. This knowledge graph feeds a data analysis process which is applied for experimenting with altmetrics as impact indicators. We find moderate correlation among traditional citation count, citations on social media, and mentions on news and blogs. Additionally, correlation coefficients are not inflated by indicators associated with zero values, which are quite common at very early stages after an article has been published. This suggests there is a common intended meaning of the citational acts associated with aforementioned indicators. Then, we define a method, i.e. the Comprehensive Impact Score (CIS), that harmonises different indicators for providing a multi-dimensional impact indicator. CIS shows promising results as a tool for selecting relevant papers even in a tight time-window.

420755,Teleworking targets,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus pandemic resulted in national lockdowns that are associated with a rise in important macro-stressors for populations worldwide. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of the COVID-19-related lockdown period on the sociocultural attitudes towards appearance, body image, eating attitudes and behaviours, physical activity, and quality of life of Lithuanian university-aged students of both genders. METHOD: A total of 1850 students completed the body image, health-related behaviour and quality of life assessments three months before the first lockdown, of which 959 provided consent and an e-mail to be contacted by for further surveys. Of these 959, 230 completed the same questionnaire during the second lockdown providing the informed consent for the participation in the COVID-19-impact for the lifestyle study and use their first round data for the comparison with the lockdown. The age of the participants was 23.9 ± 5.4 years. Independent comparisons were used to test lifestyle and body image differences between men and women before and during the lockdown. Paired-sample statistics were conducted to evaluate any changes in the male and female groups separately with Cohen's d employed to represent effect sizes. RESULTS: No body image or disordered eating changes were found, however, body appearance evaluation increased in women (effect size 0.15). Significant increases in media pressures (in women, effect size 0.16) and the internalization of thin/low body fat beauty ideals (effect size 1.18-1.46) were observed during the lockdown when compared to baseline. No changes in quality of life were evident for men, however, for women, an increase in general and psychological domain was observed (effect size 0.17). We observed a significant decrease in physical activity (in men, effect size 0.46), an increase in internet browsing time (effect size 0.52-0.8), a decrease in unhealthy eating habits (effect size 0.49-0.60), an increase in sleep duration (in women, effect size 0.40) and lower self-rated health (in men, effect size 0.42) during the lockdown when compared to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the majority of students cope with lockdown-related situation well. However, based on the Tripartite influence model, we can speculate that a drastic increase in the internalization of stereotyped thin/low body fat ideals might trigger body image concerns and increase disordered eating after the lockdown. Specific interventions helping students to decrease internalization of stereotyped body ideals, to promote positive body image and physical activity may be beneficial during and after the COVID-19-related lockdown.","Baceviciene, Migle; Jankauskiene, Rasa",Appetite,,223

421786,Editors’ Note,2021,"COVID-19 has become a pandemic that has hit all over the world. Almost all sectors are affected by this pandemic, not only in the health sector. The economic and industrial sectors have also suffered severe impacts due to the coronavirus pandemic. This spreading virus does not support economic growth either nationally or globally. Finally, it has an impact on various industrial sectors in the country, from manufacturing to finance. The industry was one of the largest contributors to Indonesia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) last year. The contribution given from this industry to the 2019 GDP was recorded at 19.62%. Due to this pandemic, according to the Central Statistics Agency (BPS), during February 2020, the importance of all categories of goods decreased compared to January 2020. This stunted industrial development was due to the government's appeal for social distancing;social distancing made it difficult for industry players to make transactions. Several obstacles require re-engineering of business processes in the industry. In general, the industry already has an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system used in the related production process. However, ERP does not enter into the realm of buying and selling or the process of procuring goods with consumers. Therefore, we need a Business Process Reengineering as an engineering process to integrate the ERP and the bidding system or quotation system. Using the moving average method as a forecasting method, we can get sustainable sales even during the COVID-period, even seen an increase in transactions in the new period, along with the implementation of the quotation information system applied in the re-engineering business process.","Subhan, Subhan; Budiman, Kholiq; Efrilianda, Devi Ajeng; en,",Scientific Journal Of Informatics,,223

In a total of thirty specimens examined, nineteen (63.3%) were infected by an undescribed parasite species belonging to the genus Myxobolus. Plasmodial development was asynchronous, with young development in the periphery and mature myxospores in the central area and without projections and microvilli in the plasmodial wall. Mature myxospores were ovoid in shape and measured 7.9â¯±â¯0.2â¯µm (7.6-8.1â¯µm) in length and 5.4â¯±â¯0.1â¯µm (5.0-5.6â¯µm) in width. The two polar capsules were equal in size, occupying a little more than half of the myxospore body, measuring 4.0â¯±â¯0.2â¯µm (3.9-4.1â¯µm) in length and 1.7â¯±â¯0.1â¯µm (1.5-1.8â¯µm) in width. The polar tubules coiled in six turns, perpendicular to the long axis of polar capsule. Phylogenetic analysis placed the new species within a clade containing nine myxobolid species from South American characiforms fish and appears as a close species of Myxobolus pantanalis. Nevertheless, the sequences of the new species and M. pantanalis have a large genetic divergence of 13.5% in their SSU rDNA. In light of the differences observed from the integrative taxonomy, we confidently considered that this isolate is a new species of cnidarian myxosporean, M. douradae n. sp., increasing the knowledge of diversity of this enigmatic group of cnidarians.","Milanin, Tiago; Mathews, Patrick D; Morandini, André C; Mertins, Omar; Audebert, Fabienne; Pereira, Jose O L; Maia, Antonio A M",Microb Pathog,,223

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study in a convenience sample of professionals from 30 health centers and 30 nursing homes from the primary care management division of the Healthcare Area of Leon. The work center, type of profession, COVID-19 infection, level of exposure, compliance with preventive measures, isolation (if required) and diagnostic tests carried out were collected. The determination of infection was made by differentiated rapid diagnostic test (dRDT), using a finger-stick whole-blood sample. The association of variables with infection was assessed by multivariable non-conditional logistic regression. The true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was calculated according to two scenarios for RDT (Sensitivity=0.6 and Specificity=0.985; Sensitivity=0.8 and Specificity=1). RESULTS: The true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was between 4.9% and 11.0%. The observed prevalence was 5.9% and was higher in nursing homes than in primary care centers (9.5% vs. 5.5%). No statistically significant differences were observed by sex, type of professional, level of exposure or compliance with preventive measures. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this group is low. A high number of professionals remain susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore protective measures should be taken, especially for professionals working in nursing homes.","Martín, V; Fernández-Villa, T; Lamuedra Gil de Gomez, M; Mencía-Ares, O; Rivero Rodríguez, A; Reguero Celada, S; Montoro Gómez, M; Nuevo Guisado, M T; Villa Aller, C; Díez Flecha, C; Carvajal, A; Fernández Vázquez, J P",Semergen,,223

In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), maintenance of pluripotency coincides with a poised chromatin state containing active and repressive histone modifications. However, the structural features of poised chromatin are largely uncharacterized. By adopting mild time-course MNase-seq with computational analysis, the low-compact chromatin in mESCs is featured in two groups: one in more open regions, corresponding to an active state, and the other enriched with bivalent histone modifications, considered the poised state. A parameter called the chromatin opening potential index (COPI) is also devised to quantify the transcription potential based on the dynamic changes of MNase-seq signals at promoter regions. Use of COPI provides effective prediction of gene activation potential and, more importantly, reveals a few developmental factors essential for mouse neural progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation.","Yu, Juan; Xiong, Chaoyang; Zhuo, Baowen; Wen, Zengqi; Shen, Jie; Liu, Cuifang; Chang, Luyuan; Wang, Kehui; Wang, Min; Wu, Chenyi; Wu, Xudong; Xu, Xueqin; Ruan, Haihe; Li, Guohong",Cell Rep,,223

426312,Towards a Multispectral RGB-IR-UV-D Vision System -- Seeing the Invisible in 3D,2021-08-19,"Voluntary shelter-in-place directives and lockdowns are the main non-pharmaceutical interventions that governments around the globe have used to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. In this paper we study the impact of such interventions in the capital of a developing country, Santiago, Chile, that exhibits large socioeconomic inequality. A distinctive feature of our study is that we use granular geolocated mobile phone data to construct mobility measures that capture (1) shelter-in-place behavior, and (2) trips within the city to destinations with potentially different risk profiles. Using panel data linear regression models we first show that the impact of social distancing measures and lockdowns on mobility is highly heterogeneous and dependent on socioeconomic levels. More specifically, our estimates indicate that while zones of high socioeconomic levels can exhibit reductions in mobility of around 50\% to 90\% depending on the specific mobility metric used, these reductions are only 20\% to 50\% for lower-income communities. The large reductions in higher-income communities are significantly driven by voluntary shelter-in-place behavior. Second, also using panel data methods we show that our mobility measures are important predictors of infections: roughly, a 10\% increase in mobility correlates with a 5\% increase in the rate of infection. Our results suggest that mobility is an important factor explaining differences in infections rates between high and low incomes areas within the city. Further, they confirm the challenges of reducing mobility in lower-income communities, where people generate their income from their daily work. To be effective, shelter-in-place restrictions in municipalities of low socioeconomic levels may need to be complemented by other supporting measures that enable their inhabitants to increase compliance.","Carranza, Aldo; Goic, Marcel; Lara, Eduardo; Olivares, Marcelo; Weintraub, Gabriel Y.; Covarrubia, Julio; Escobedo, Cristian; Jara, Natalia; Basso, Leonardo J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13292v2.pdf,223

We found that antibody sequences from different discovery cohorts shared biochemical properties and could be retrieved across validation cohorts confirming the stereotyped character of this naive response in COVID-19. While neutralizing antibody sequences were found independently of disease severity in line with serological data, individual non-neutralizing antibody sequences were associated with fatal clinical courses suggesting detrimental effects of these antibodies. We mined 200 immune repertoires of healthy individuals and 500 of patients with blood or solid cancers - all acquired prior to the pandemic - for SARS-CoV-2 antibody sequences. While the largely unmutated B cell rearrangements occurred in a substantial fraction of immune repertoires from young and healthy individuals, these sequences were less likely found in individuals over 60 years of age and in cancer. This reflects B cell repertoire restriction in aging and cancer and may to a certain extent explain the different clinical COVID-19 courses observed in these risk groups.

428308,Leonardite iron humate and synthetic iron chelates mixtures in Glycine max nutrition,2021,"Detecting and analyzing patient insights from social media enables healthcare givers to better understand what patients want and also to identify their pain points. Healthcare institutions cannot neglect the need to monitor and analyze popular social media outlets such as Twitter and Facebook. To have a study success, a healthcare giver needs to be able to engage with their patients and adapt to their preferences effectively. However, data-driven decision-making is no longer enough, as the best-in-class organizations struggle to realize tangible benefits from their data-driven analytics investments. Relying on simplistic textual analytics that use big data technologies to learn consumer/patient insights is no longer sufficient as most of these analytics utilize sort of bag-of-words counting algorithms. The majority of projects utilizing big data analytics have failed due to the obsession with metrics at the expense of capturing the customer's perspective data, as well as the failure in turning consumer insights into actions. Most of the consumer insights can be captured with qualitative research methods that work with small, even statistically insignificant, sample sizes. Employing qualitative analytics provide some kind of actionable intelligence which acquires understanding to broad questions about the consumer needs in tandem with analytical power. Generating insight, on one hand, requires sound techniques to measure consumers' engagement more precisely and offers depth analytics to the consumer data story. On the other hand, turning relevant insights into actions requires incorporating actionable intelligence across the business by verify hypotheses based on qualitative findings by using web analytics to see if these axioms apply to a large number of customers. The first component of our visionary approach is dedicated to identifying the relationships between constituents of the healthcare pain points as echoed by the social media conversation in terms of sociographic network where the elements composing these conversations are described as nodes and their interactions as links. In this part, conversation groups of nodes that are heavily connected will be identified representing what we call conversation communities. By identifying these conversation communities several consumer hidden insights can be inferred from using techniques such as visualizing conversation graphs relevant to given pain point, conversation learning from question answering, conversations summaries, conversation timelines, conversation anomalies and other conversation pattern learning techniques. These techniques will identify and learn the patient insights without forgetting from the context of conversation communities, are tagged as 'thick data analytics'. Additionally machine learning methods can be used as assistive techniques to learn from the identified thick data and build models around identified thick data. With the use of transfer learning we also can fine tune these models with the arrival of new conversations.

There is increasing evidence for p57 to control cellular processes in addition to cell cycle and CDK regulation including transcription, apoptosis, migration or development. In order to obtain molecular insights to unknown functions of p57, we performed a protein interaction screen. We identified the transcription regulator four-and-a-half LIM-only protein 2 (FHL2) as a novel p57-binding protein. Co-immunoprecipitation and reporter gene assays were used to elucidate the physiological and functional relevance of p57/FHL2 interaction. We found in cancer cells that endogenous p57 and FHL2 are in a complex. We observed a substantial induction of established FHL2-regulated gene promoters by p57 in reporter gene experiments and detected strong induction of the intrinsic transactivation activity of FHL2. Treatment of cells with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and binding of exogenous FHL2 to HDACs indicated repression of FHL2 transcription activity by HDACs. In the presence of the HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate activation of FHL2 by p57 is abrogated suggesting that p57 shares a common pathway with HDAC inhibitors. p57 competes with HDACs for FHL2 binding which might partly explain the mechanism of FHL2 activation by p57. These results suggest a novel function of p57 in transcription regulation.","Kullmann, Michael Keith; Podmirseg, Silvio Roland; Roilo, Martina; Hengst, Ludger",Sci Rep,,223
430189,Face coverings and respiratory tract droplet dispersion,2020,"The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing with no direct treatment for the disease. Few repurposed drugs, such as Remdesivir, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir, and Ritonavir, are being tested against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir is the drug of choice for Ebola virus disease and has been authorized for emergency use. This drug acts against SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting the RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2. RdRp of viruses is prone to mutations that confer drug resistance. A recent study by Pachetti et al. in 2020 identified the P323L mutation in the RdRp protein of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we aimed to determine the potency of lead compounds similar to Remdesivir, which can be used as an alternative when variants of SARS-CoV-2 develop resistance due to RdRp mutations. The initial screening yielded 704 compounds that were 90% similar to the control drug, Remdesivir. On further evaluation through drugability and antiviral inhibition percentage analyses, we shortlisted 32 and seven compounds, respectively. These seven compounds were further analyzed for their molecular interactions, which revealed that all seven compounds interacted with RdRp with higher affinity than Remdesivir under native conditions. However, three compounds failed to interact with the mutant protein with higher affinity than Remdesivir. Dynamic cross-correlation matrix (DCCM) and vector field collective motions analyses were performed to identify the precise movements of docked complexes' residues. Furthermore, the compound SCHEMBL20144212 showed a high affinity for native and mutant proteins and might provide an alternative against SARS-CoV-2 variants that might confer resistance to Remdesivir. Further validations by in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of our lead compounds for their inhibition against SARS-CoV-2.","Kumar, D. T.; Shaikh, N.; Kumar, S.

However, mask use has been thought to increase people's face-touching frequency and thus risk of self-inoculation. Across two studies, we video-observed the face-touching behaviour of members of the public in Amsterdam and Rotterdam (the Netherlands) during the first wave of the pandemic. Study 1 (n = 383) yielded evidence in favour of the absence of an association between mask-wearing and face-touching (defined as touches of face or mask), and Study 2 (n = 421) replicated this result. Secondary outcome analysis of the two studies-analysed separately and with pooled data sets-evidenced a negative association between mask-wearing and hand contact with the face and its t-zone (i.e. eyes, nose and mouth). In sum, the current findings alleviate the concern that mask-wearing has an adverse face-touching effect.","Liebst, Lasse S; Ejbye-Ernst, Peter; de Bruin, Marijn; Thomas, Josephine; Lindegaard, Marie R",Transbound. emerg. dis.

430720,Learning to manage long covid,2021,"COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), to date, SARS-CoV-2 has already infected more than 91.8 million people worldwide with 1,986,871 deaths. This virus affects mainly the respiratory system, but the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is also a target, meanwhile SARS-CoV-2 was already detected in oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, rectum, and in fecal samples from COVID-19 patients. Prolonged GIT manifestations in COVID-19, mainly the diarrhea, were correlated with decreased richness and diversity of the gut microbiota, immune deregulation and delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance. So, the bidirectional interactions between the respiratory mucosa and the gut microbiota, known as gut-lung axis, are supposed to be involved in the healthy or pathologic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. In accordance, the intestinal dysbiosis is associated with increased mortality in other respiratory infections, due to an exacerbated inflammation and decreased regulatory or anti-inflammatory mechanisms in the lungs and in the gut, pointing to this important relationship between both mucosal compartments. Therefore, since the mucous membranes from the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are affected, in addition to dysbiosis and inflammation, it is plausible to assume that adjunctive therapies based on the modulation of the gut microbiota and re-establishment of eubiosis conditions could be an important therapeutic approach for constraining the harmful consequences of COVID-19. Then, in this review, we summarized studies showing the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal system and the related digestive COVID-19 manifestations, in addition to the literature demonstrating nasopharyngeal, pulmonary and intestinal dysbiosis in COVID-19 patients. Lastly, we showed the potential beneficial role of probiotic administration in other respiratory infections, and discuss the possible role of probiotics as an adjunctive therapy in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","de Oliveira, Gislane Lelis Vilela; Oliveira, Camilla Narjara Simão; Pinzan, Camila Figueiredo; de Salis, Larissa Vedovato Vilela; Cardoso, Cristina Ribeiro de Barros",Front Immunol,,223

The models are trained with 75% of the samples and tested with 25% of data. Since the dataset is imbalanced, the performances of all the three algorithms are evaluated on various measures like F-Measure, Accuracy and Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Accuracy is measured over correctly and incorrectly classified instances. All the analyses were performed with the use of Python, version 3.8.2. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are used to verify the result in a proper and systematic manner.

Only four positive cases were reported over the successive 15 days. Stability was disrupted when two major mass events were organized despite various health professional warnings. In a matter of few just days, daily cases rose to two-digit figures, with high community transmission, a drastic rise in active cases, and a rate per hundred thousand in Europe second only to Spain. Frontliners were swamped with swabbing requests while trying to sustain robust case management, contact tracing and follow-up. Indeed, the number of hospitalizations and the need for intensive ventilation increased. Despite the initial cases were among young adults, within weeks a small spill off on the more elderly population was observed. Restrictions were re-introduced including mandatory mask wearing in specific locations and capping of the total number of people in a single gathering. Malta is an island and the potential for containment would have been relatively simple and effective and permitting mass gatherings was unwise. Protecting the health of the population should take centre stage while carrying out extensive testing, contact tracing and surveillance.

432069,Momentum managing epidemic spread and Bessel functions,2020-04-13,"Background: Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is spreading globally and treatment options remain limited. A formulation of niclosamide, a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent and a broad-spectrum antiviral treatment candidate, optimized for inhalation and intranasal administration (UNI91104) was developed. Methods: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-centre, dose-ascending Phase 1 trial to assess the safety of UNI91104 in Denmark (NCT04576312). Healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to a ascending single dose in cohort 1-4 and five doses over 2.5 days in cohort 5. Inclusion criteria included a minimum 80% of predicted lung function. Exclusion criteria included severe, clinically significant allergies and current acute or chronic condition especially airway diseases. Safety was evaluated through adverse events (AEs) and pulmonary function tests including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests. The primary endpoints were defined as the frequency of reported AEs and the change of safety variables relative to pre-dose. Data from all enroled healthy volunteers receiving any amount of IMP was included in the primary analyses. The pharmacokinetics of UNI91104 was determined. Findings: The trial was conducted between 29 June 2020 and 08 August 2020. Thirty-four healthy volunteers received UNI91104 and ten placebo. No serious AEs or discontinuation were reported. Mild irritation in the upper respiratory tract following inhalation of UNI91104 was reported as most frequent AE (45 events in 26 healthy volunteers, 59% of all healthy volunteers). Nasal application was well-tolerated. There was no evidence of difference in the change of mean levels of pulmonary function tests between active and placebo group across all cohorts. Five healthy volunteers (11.4%) (1 on placebo) had signs of increased transient FeNO and 4 on active (9.1%) experienced asymptomatic drops in FEV1, which resolved spontaneously or were reversible with a ß2-agonist. Niclosamide exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics following inhalation and intranasal administration. Interpretation: UNI91104, a promising candidate for inhalation and intranasal therapy against COVID-19 and other viral respiratory tract infections is well-tolerated in healthy volunteers and warrants further testing in patient trials. Funding: The study was funded by Innovationsfonden Denmark and UNION therapeutics.","Backer, Vibeke; Sjöbring, Ulf; Sonne, Jesper; Weiss, Anne; Hostrup, Morten; Johansen, Helle Krogh; Becker, Victoria; Sonne, David P; Balchen, Torben; Jellingsø, Mads; Sommer, Morten Otto Alexander",Lancet Reg Health Eur,,223

433194,"A Closed-Loop Framework for Inference, Prediction and Control of SIR Epidemics on Networks",2020-06-23,"This paper builds on insights in feminist economic geography to critically review the literature on work in the home and provide a starting point for examining COVID-19 pandemic-imposed work from home measures for tertiary and quaternary sector firms and organizations. It critically reviews literature on the pandemic, working from home, and work in general, to examine lockdown-related workplace disruptions in relation to the various forms of work that took place in the home prior to the pandemic. It argues that feminist economic geography provides a starting point for examinations of working from home during and after COVID-19. This situates writing on social reproduction, and informal and unpaid work in the home, within the purview of our understanding of pandemic response. Following this review, the paper demonstrates this argument by interrogating Canada's ""telework capacity"" discourse and the decisions by white-collar offices regarding the continuation and abatement of ""digital by default"" policies. The pandemic will radically shift our understanding of the meanings of both home and work, and this paper, through a critical review of key literature, suggests that feminist economic geography provides one starting point for theorizing the implications of that shift in the Canadian context.","Cockayne, Daniel",,,223

This highlights the importance of implementing HIV testing and linkage interventions with a high uptake in this population. In a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted in Kenya between 2013 and 2015, we found that assisted partner services (APS) for HIV-exposed partners of newly diagnosed PLWH safely reached more HIV-exposed individuals with HIV testing compared with client referral alone. However, more data are needed to evaluate APS implementation in a real-world setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, acceptability, fidelity, and cost of APS when integrated into existing HIV testing services (HTS) in Western Kenya. METHODS: Our study team from the University of Washington and PATH is integrating APS into 31 health facilities in Western Kenya. We are enrolling females newly diagnosed with HIV (index clients) who consent to receiving APS, their male sexual partners, and female sexual partners of male sexual partners who tested HIV positive. Female index clients and sexual partners testing HIV positive will be followed up at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months postenrollment to assess linkage to care, antiretroviral therapy initiation, and HIV viral load suppression. We will evaluate the acceptability, fidelity, and cost of real-world implementation of APS via in-depth interviews conducted with national, county, and subcounty-level policy makers responsible for HTS. Facility health staff providing HTS and APS, in addition to staff working with the study project team, will also be interviewed. We will also conduct direct observations of facility infrastructure and clinical procedures and extract data from the facilities and county and national databases. RESULTS: As of March 2020, we have recruited 1724 female index clients, 3201 male partners, and 1585 female partners. We have completed study recruitment as well as 6-week (2936/2973, 98.75%), 6-month (1596/1641, 97.25%), and 12-month (725/797, 90.9%) follow-up visits. Preliminary analyses show that facilities scaling up APS identify approximately 12-18 new HIV-positive males for every 100 men contacted and tested. We are currently completing the remaining follow-up interviews and incorporating an HIV self-testing component into the study in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Texas Rising Star (TRS), a voluntary QRIS, exceeds state licensing standards and meets some obesity prevention guidelines. This study examines differences in physical activity, screen time, and outdoor policies and practices by QRIS certification. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Online. SAMPLE: After exclusion criteria, respondents were 431 Texas childcare centers. MEASURES: 2016 survey of policies and Go NAPSACC best practices. ANALYSIS: Chi-square and t-tests indicated differences in 1) practices and 2) policies by QRIS status. RESULTS: TRS-certified centers reported more policies for physical activity (M = 4.57 ± 3.07 vs. 3.61 ± 2.95, p = 0.009) and screen time (M = 1.91 ± 1.84 vs. 1.28 ± 1.56, p < 0.001) than non-certified centers. TRS-certified centers reported significantly higher frequencies for 7 of 14 physical activity practices, however no significant differences for screen time practices were found. Additionally, TRS-certified centers reported more outdoor practices, including more classrooms/storage (p < 0.001) and vegetable gardens (p = 0.025). CONCLUSION: TRS-certified centers reported more physical activity policies and practices, more screen time policies, and more outdoor practices.

We aim to summarize different aspects, such as CoV immune evasion mechanisms and host innate immune response to these infections, and their role in pathogenesis. We have also elaborated the up-to-date findings on different vaccine development strategies and progress against CoVs in both humans and non-human models. Most importantly, we have described the Phageome-human immune interaction, its therapeutic usage as anti-viral, anti-inflammatory agent, and implications for multiple vaccine development systems. The data suggest that endogenous phages might play a vital role in eliminating the infection and regulating the body's immune system. Considering the innate-immune-induced pathogenesis against CoVs and the therapeutic aptitude of phageome, we propose that the prophylactic administration of phages and phage-based vaccines could be a useful strategy to control the emerging CoV infections.","Abaidullah, M; Peng, S; Kamran, M; Song, X; Ali Sher, A; Chen, Y; Rehman, A; Lin, L; Jia, R; Yin, Z",J. biol. regul. homeost. agents,,223

443972,MATCH: Metadata-Aware Text Classification in A Large Hierarchy,2021-02-15,"This research consisted of two studies to investigate how the Chinese rural educational system supported students' online learning and to determine the factors that influenced students' online learning quality (satisfaction and cognitive and social presence) during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Study 1, based on interviews with three curriculum officers, seven principals and 30 course teachers, found that great efforts were made to realize digital equity and education for all students. The necessity of providing resources and support to teachers and students (facilitating conditions) was recognized, along with the importance of teachers' online course design and organization and the facilitation of discourse (teaching presence and social presence). Based on the findings of Study 1 and the literature review, a conceptual model of facilitating conditions and teaching presence reported to influence students' online learning quality was generated. In Study 2, 1,409 students from three rural primary schools were surveyed to test the conceptual model. The results indicated that facilitating conditions influenced students' online learning quality through enhanced technology self‐efficacy and perceived usefulness. Teaching presence directly and positively predicted students' online learning quality. This research highlights the importance of creating a learning community and providing technology access and support to ensure online learning opportunities and quality for rural students. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Chinese students from rural or migrant schools have fewer opportunities to access computers and the Internet, lower frequencies of online activity and technology self‐efficacy and less training and parental and teacher support. Providing support and resources to encourage and facilitate technology use among teachers and students in rural and underdeveloped schools is of great importance. Identifying the factors that contribute to online learning quality among rural school students to tackle the transition to online learning is necessary. What this paper adds The rural government and schools have made great efforts to ensure digital equity and education for all students, despite family conditions. Facilitating purposeful interactions and providing timely feedback is critical for effective learning in online teaching. Facilitating conditions represented by available support and resources and teaching presence influence students' online learning quality in rural areas. Implications for practice and/or policy Providing digital equipment and resources to all students is the first step towards distance learning. Providing opportunities to improve teachers' digital competency is critical for providing quality online instruction. Providing students timely assistance and useful and learner‐friendly technologies to enhance their satisfaction and social and cognitive presence is necessary. Online instructors should create a friendly online learning environment, facilitate active discussion and purposeful reflection and create opportunities to promote students' open communication, group cohesion and meaning construction.

Considering the serious medical, economic and social consequences of this pandemic and the lack of definite medication and vaccine it is necessary to describe natural immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 in order to exploit them for treating the patients and monitoring the general population. Moreover, detecting the most immunogenic antigens of the virus is fundamental for designing effective vaccines. Antibodies being valuable for diagnostic therapeutic and protective purposes are suitable to be addressed in this context. Herein, we have summarized the findings of serological investigations and the outcomes of neutralizing antibodies administration in COVID-19 patients.","Assadiasl, Sara; Fatahi, Yousef; Zavvar, Mahdi; Nicknam, Mohammad Hossein",Hum. antibodies,,223
447394,Mathematical models to guide pandemic response,2020,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the substance use and mental health characteristics of nurses who complete suicide compared to non-nurses. BACKGROUND: Nurses are at higher risk of suicide than the general population. The relationship between substance use, mental health and suicide in a large sample of nurses in the USA has not been previously described. DESIGN: Retrospective observational quantitative analysis. METHODS: Suicide data were retrospectively analysed in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Violent Death Reporting System from 2003 to 2017. Data were compared between nurses who died by suicide (n = 2,306) and non-nurses who died by suicide (n = 185,620) using odds ratios calculations and chi-square test of proportions to detect independent risk factors of suicide completion in nurses. This study followed the STROBE guidelines. RESULTS: Significant differences between nurses and non-nurses were found. Among decedents for whom substances were implicated as a cause of death, nurses were far more likely to be positive at the time of death for almost all substance classifications. Both male and female nurses were more likely than non-nurses to have a mental health problem reported. Among both female and male nurses, job problems were more prevalent compared to non-nurses (12.8% and 19.9% versus 7.2% and 11.9%, respectively). Female nurses were more likely to have a physical health problem compared to female non-nurses, male nurses and male non-nurses (26.2% versus 21.3%, 22% and 20.4%). CONCLUSION: Unique relationships between substance use and mental health exist among nurses who complete suicide which may offer specific opportunities for interventions to reduce suicide. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Efforts to address workplace stress, facilitate self-referral for risky substance use, encourage mental health treatment and reduce the stigma associated with seeking help all offer potential interventions to reduce nurse suicide.","Choflet, Amanda; Davidson, Judy; Lee, Kelly C; Ye, Gordon; Barnes, Arianna; Zisook, Sidney",J. clin. nurs,,223
447395,Mathematical models to guide pandemic response,2020,"There is an ongoing need of developing sensitive and specific methods for the determination of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion. For this purpose, we have developed a multiplexed flow cytometric bead array (C19BA) that allows the identification of IgG and IgM antibodies against three immunogenic proteins simultaneously: the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), the spike protein subunit 1 (S1) and the nucleoprotein (N). Using different cohorts of samples collected before and after the pandemic, we show that this assay is more sensitive than ELISAs performed in our laboratory. The combination of three viral antigens allows for the interrogation of full seroconversion. Importantly, we have detected N-reactive antibodies in COVID-19-negative individuals. Here we present an immunoassay that can be easily implemented and has superior potential to detect low antibody titers compared to current gold standard serology methods.","Egia-Mendikute, Leire; Bosch, Alexandre; Prieto-Fernández, Endika; Lee, So Young; Jiménez-Lasheras, Borja; García Del Río, Ana; Antoñana-Vildosola, Asier; Bruzzone, Chiara; Bizkarguenaga, Maider; Embade, Nieves; Gil-Redondo, Rubén; Martínez-Chantar, María Luz; López-Hoyos, Marcos; Abrescia, Nicola G A; Mato, José M; Millet, Óscar; Palazón, Asís",Commun Biol,,223
447779,Russian Market of Ceramic Bricks. Development Trends and Prospects,2020,"As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused taste loss at a rate higher than that of influenza. ACE2, the entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, has been identified in the oral epithelium; however, it is unclear at what developmental stage ACE2 expression emerges and whether ACE2 is expressed in taste buds. To identify the specific developmental stage, we analyzed RNA-Seq data from embryonic and newborn mouse oral tissue. We found that robust ACE2 expression was observed in the newborn oral epithelium. In contrast, only extremely low levels, if any, of ACE2 transcripts in the embryonic stage oral tissue were found (E12.5 and E14.5). Analyses of three public scRNA-seq data sets of adult mouse tongue epithelial cells showed that receptors for various viruses were enriched in distinct clusters of tongue epithelial cells. ACE2 was enriched in a subpopulation of epithelial cells in the basal region of nongustatory filiform papillae but not in the taste papillae or taste buds. Expression of ACE2 was detected in a small proportion of type III taste cells. Our results indicate that when applied across species, nongustatory papilla epithelial cells are the prime targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the tongue; thus, taste loss in COVID-19 patients is likely not caused by a direct infection of SARS-CoV-2 to taste bud cells. Additionally, fetuses at different stages of development may have distinct susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wang, Zhonghou; Zhou, Jingqi; Marshall, Brett; Rekaya, Romdhane; Ye, Kaixiong; Liu, Hong-Xiang",ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci,,223

This epidemic is still spreading and showing no signs of decreasing trend. Vaccination could be the only effective and economical means to control this pandemic. A number of research institutions and pharmaceutical companies have plunged into the race of vaccine development against COVID-19 which are in various stages of development. An intriguing fact of coronavirus infections is that in every decade of the 21st century there is a new major coronavirus epidemic, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and now COVID-19; and such epidemics are expected in future too. Since most of the biological characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are still obscure, the scientists are relying on the information available on SARS-CoV and to some extent on MERS-CoV for designing and developing COVID-19 vaccines. But there is a need of vigorous testing for immunogenicity, safety, efficacy, and level of protection conferred in the hosts. This review focuses on the challenges and prospects of vaccine development against COVID-19. It highlights seriousness, bottlenecks in vaccine development, possible vaccine candidates, different vaccine strategies, safety evaluation issues, and vaccine production processes pertaining to COVID-19 based on the knowledge acquired on SARS and MERS vaccine development in the past.","Begum, Jubeda; Mir, Nasir Akbar; Dev, Kapil; Buyamayum, Bidyarani; Wani, Mohd Yaqoob; Raza, Meesam",Transbound. emerg. dis.

448099,Pandemics' historical role in creating inequality,2020,"The existing biclustering algorithms for finding feature relation based biclusters often depend on assumptions like monotonicity or linearity. Though a few algorithms overcome this problem by using density-based methods, they tend to miss out many biclusters because they use global criteria for identifying dense regions. The proposed method, RelDenClu uses the local variations in marginal and joint densities for each pair of features to find the subset of observations, which forms the bases of the relation between them. It then finds the set of features connected by a common set of observations, resulting in a bicluster. To show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, experimentation has been carried out on fifteen types of simulated datasets. Further, it has been applied to six real-life datasets. For three of these real-life datasets, the proposed method is used for unsupervised learning, while for other three real-life datasets it is used as an aid to supervised learning. For all the datasets the performance of the proposed method is compared with that of seven different state-of-the-art algorithms and the proposed algorithm is seen to produce better results. The efficacy of proposed algorithm is also seen by its use on COVID-19 dataset for identifying some features (genetic, demographics and others) that are likely to affect the spread of COVID-19.","Jain, Namita; Ghosh, Susmita; Murthy, C.

451142,Editor's Note: March 2021,2021,"Background The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) is quite a challenging experience for the world. At the moment of birth, the fetus is prepared to face the challenge of labor and the exposure to the outside world, meaning that labor and birth represent the first extrauterine major exposure to a complex microbiota. The vagina, which is a canal for reproduction, is by evolution separated (but not far) from the anus and urethra. Passing through the birthing canal is a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of vaginal and gut microorganisms for the vertical transmission of microbiota not only from our mothers and grandmothers but also from earlier ancestors. Methods Many national and international instructions have been developed since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak in January 2020 in Wuhan in China. All of them pointed out hygiene measures, social distancing and avoidance of social contacts as the most important epidemiological preventive measures. Pregnancy and neonatal periods are considered as high risk for Covid-19 infection. Results The instructions defined the care for pregnant women in the delivery room, during a hospital stay and after discharge. The controversial procedures in the care of Covid-19-suspected or -positive asymptomatic women in labor were: mode of delivery, companion during birth and labor, skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding, and visits during a hospital stay. Conclusion There is a hope that instruction on coping with the coronavirus (Covid-19) infection in pregnancy with all proposed interventions affecting mothers, babies and families, besides saving lives, are beneficial and efficient by exerting no harm.","Stanojevic, Milan",J Perinat Med,,223
451143,Editor's Note: March 2021,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a unique situation for humanity, reaching up to 5623 deaths in Sao Paulo city during the analyzed period of this study. Due to the measures for social distancing, an improvement of air quality was observed worldwide. In view of this scenario, we investigated the air quality improvement related to PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 concentrations during 90 days of quarantine compared to an equivalent period in 2019. We found a significant drop in air pollution of 45% of PM10, 46% of PM2.5, and 58% of NO2, and using a relative-risk function, we estimated that this significant air quality improvement avoided, respectively, 78, 337, and 387 premature deaths, respectively, and prevented approximately US $720 million on health costs. Moreover, we estimated that 5623 deaths by COVID-19 represent an economic health loss of US $10.5 billion. Both health and economic gains associated with air pollution reductions give a positive perspective of the efforts towards keeping air pollution reduced even after the pandemic, highlighting the importance of improving the strategies of air pollution mitigation actions, as well as the crucial role of adopting efficient measures to protect human health both during and after the COVID-19 global health crisis.","Debone, D.; Costa, M.

Since clinical presentations of CSF are highly variable and may be confused with other viral diseases in pigs, laboratory diagnosis is indispensable for an unambiguous diagnosis. On an international level, well-established diagnostic tests of CSF such as virus isolation, fluorescent antibody test (FAT), antigen capture antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), virus neutralization test (VNT), and antibody ELISA have been described in detail in the OIE Terrestrial Manual.

The International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) formed a panel of experts to develop consensus recommendations on the implications of the pandemic on several aspects of cancer care in this age group including geriatric assessment (GA), surgery, radiotherapy, systemic treatment, palliative care and research. Age and cancer diagnosis are significant predictors of adverse outcomes of the COVID-19 infection. In this setting, GA is particularly valuable to drive decision-making. GA may aid estimating physiologic reserve and adaptive capability, assessing risk-benefits of either providing or temporarily withholding treatments, and determining patient preferences to help inform treatment decisions. In a resource-constrained setting, geriatric screening tools may be administered remotely to identify patients requiring comprehensive GA. Tele-health is also crucial to ensure adequate continuity of care and minimize the risk of infection exposure. In general, therapeutic decisions should favor the most effective and least invasive approach with the lowest risk of adverse outcomes. In selected cases, this might require deferring or omitting surgery, radiotherapy or systemic treatments especially where benefits are marginal and alternative safe therapeutic options are available. Ongoing research is necessary to expand knowledge of the management of cancer in older adults. However, the pandemic presents a significant barrier and efforts should be made to ensure equitable access to clinical trials and prospective data collection to elucidate the outcomes of COVID-19 in this population.","Battisti, Nicolò Matteo Luca; Mislang, Anna Rachelle; Cooper, Lisa; O039,; Donovan, Anita; Audisio, Riccardo A; Cheung, Kwok-Leung; Sarrió, Regina Gironés; Stauder, Reinhard; Soto-Perez-de-Celis, Enrique; Jaklitsch, Michael; Williams, Grant R; Hanlon, Shane; Alam, Mahmood; Cairo, Clarito; Colloca, Giuseppe; Gil, Luiz Antonio; Sattar, Schroder; Kantilal, Kumud; Russo, Chiara; Lichtman, Stuart M; Brain, Etienne; Kanesvaran, Ravindran; Wildiers, Hans",J Geriatr Oncol,,223
452667,"Policing the Block: Pandemics, Systemic Racism, and the Blood of America",2020,"We study the problem of allocating bailouts (stimulus, subsidy allocations) to people participating in a financial network subject to income shocks. We build on the financial clearing framework of Eisenberg and Noe that allows the incorporation of a bailout policy that is based on discrete bailouts motivated by the types of stimulus checks people receive around the world as part of COVID-19 economical relief plans. We show that optimally allocating such bailouts on a financial network in order to maximize a variety of social welfare objectives of this form is a computationally intractable problem. We develop approximation algorithms to optimize these objectives and establish guarantees for their approximation rations. Then, we incorporate multiple fairness constraints in the optimization problems and establish relative bounds on the solutions with versus without these constraints. Finally, we apply our methodology to a variety of data, both in the context of a system of large financial institutions with real-world data, as well as in a realistic societal context with financial interactions between people and businesses for which we use semi-artificial data derived from mobility patterns. Our results suggest that the algorithms we develop and study have reasonable results in practice and outperform other network-based heuristics. We argue that the presented problem through the societal-level lens could assist policymakers in making informed decisions on issuing subsidies.","Papachristou, Marios; Kleinberg, Jon",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07560v3.pdf,223
452891,Complex dynamics of some models of antimicrobial resistance on complex networks,2020,"Video conferencing systems have long facilitated work-related conversations among remote teams. However, social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic has forced colleagues to use video conferencing platforms to additionally fulfil social needs. Social talk, or informal talk, is an important workplace practice that is used to build and maintain bonds in everyday interactions among colleagues. Currently, there is a limited understanding of how video conferencing facilitates multiparty social interactions among colleagues. In our paper, we examine social talk practices during the COVID-19 pandemic among remote colleagues through semi-structured interviews. We uncovered three key themes in our interviews, discussing 1) the changing purposes and opportunities afforded by using video conferencing for social talk with colleagues, 2) how the nature of existing relationships and status of colleagues influences social conversations and 3) the challenges and changing conversational norms around politeness and etiquette when using video conferencing to hold social conversations. We discuss these results in relation to the impact that video conferencing tools have on remote social talk between colleagues and outline design and best practice considerations for multiparty videoconferencing social talk in the workplace.","Bleakley, Anna; Rough, Daniel; Edwards, Justin; Doyle, Philip R.; Dumbleton, Odile; Clark, Leigh; Rintel, Sean; Wade, Vincent; Cowan, Benjamin R.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14965v1.pdf,223
453707,Modeling and simulating the spatial spread of an epidemic through multiscale kinetic transport equations,2021,"Pandemic processes are important factors triggering the changes in the psychological and sociological structure of society. The COVID-19 outbreak has embodied many variables affecting people's lives in several terms in Turkey as in the whole world. People have appeared to face many psychosocial and economic difficulties due to the social and economic conditions changing with the pandemic period. During this period, domestic workers are the first people who experience these problems in multiple ways. Hope is an important concept in terms of protecting and improving the well-being of domestic worker women who have serious problems in terms of social security, social relations and economic income. Therefore, this research aims at examining the hope mechanisms developed by female domestic workers against the difficulties they experience during the pandemic period between March-June 2020. As it known, hope increases the well-being of people. 15 female domestic workers participated in the research, which was designed in a descriptive phenomenological pattern. The analyses obtained as a result of the interviews held with the female domestic workers revealed that the findings were related to the themes of sources of hope and adaptation process during the pandemic. When the sources of motivation in the structuring of hope are reviewed, it is noteworthy that they are divided into the subthemes of social and inner sources. Considering the relationship of hope with the adaptation to the pandemic period, on the other hand, the subthemes of efforts on reducing concerns, rearrangement of the financial life and view of the future come to the fore.","Demir Çelebi, Çigdem Parlak Simel Yaman Neslihan",International Journal of Psychology and Educational Studies,,223

However, no study has examined closed POD recruitment strategies or approaches to determine best practices, such as how to select or recruit an agency, group, or business to become a closed POD site once a potential partner has been identified. We conducted qualitative interviews with US disaster planners to identify their approaches and challenges to recruiting closed POD sites. In total, 16 disaster planners participated. Recruitment considerations related to selecting sites, paperwork needed, and challenges faced in recruiting closed POD sites. Important selection criteria for sites included size, agencies or businesses with vulnerable or confined populations who lack access or ability to get to or through open POD sites, and critical infrastructure organizations. Major challenges to recruitment included difficulty convincing sites of closed POD importance, obstacles with recruiting sites that can administer mass vaccination, and fear of legal repercussions related to medical countermeasure dispensing or administration. Closed POD recruitment is a frequently challenging but highly necessary process both before and during the current pandemic. These recommendations can be used by other disaster planners intending to start or expand their closed POD network. Public health agencies should continue working toward improved distribution plans for medical countermeasures, both oral and vaccine, to minimize morbidity and mortality during mass casualty events.","Rebmann, Terri; Foerst, Kyle; Charney, Rachel L; Sandcork, Jessica; Mazzara, Rachel L",Health Secur,,223

METHODS: We compared all visits to the OER to Meir Medical Center in Israel, from March 15th to April 15th, 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic and government mandated quarantine, to the same period in 2019. Factors analyzed were patient demographics, chief complaints, referral patterns, exam findings, treatments given, hospitalizations and surgical interventions. RESULTS: We included in this study 1311 visits of 1158 patients, 477 during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic and 834 during the same period in 2019. The demographic distribution (age, gender, and ethnicity) was similar between the two periods. LogMAR visual acuity at presentation was worse during the Covid-19 pandemic (0.42 ± 0.6 and 0.34 ± 0.5 in 2020 and 2019 respectively; p = 0.025) and the number of emergent surgeries was higher (3.7% in 2020 vs 1.8% in 2019, p = 0.026). In 2019 there was a higher likelihood of involvement of both segments of the eye (4.82% versus 1.2%, p < 0.01) and more diagnoses were given to each patient (1 ± 0.5 versus 0.93 ± 0.35, p = 0.001; During the Covid - 19 pandemic medications (both topical and systemic) were prescribed more often (1.22 ± 0.95 in 2020 and 0.84 ± 0.67 in 2019, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: OER visits were less frequent during the Covid - 19 pandemic as compared to 2019, though the demographics of the patients remained unchanged. Visits during the pandemic tended to be for more severe ocular conditions, with worse visual acuity at presentation and required more medical and surgical treatment which imply higher necessity of ocular evaluation. This analysis can aid healthcare resource management in similar scenarios in the future.","Yehezkeli, Veronika; Rotenstreich, Ygal; Haim, Liron Naftali Ben; Sher, Ifat; Achiron, Asaf; Belkin, Avner",BMC Ophthalmol,,223

Concluding Observations and Resources,2020,"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first isolated from Wuhan city, China and within three months, the global community was challenged with a devastating pandemic. The rapid spread of the virus challenged diagnostic laboratories to rapidly develop molecular diagnostic methods. As SARS CoV-2 assays became available for testing on existing molecular platforms, laboratories devoted unprecedented energy and resources into evaluating the analytical performance of the new tests and in some cases developed their own diagnostic assays under FDA-EUA guidance. This study compares the validation of three different molecular assays at the Johns Hopkins Molecular Virology laboratory: the RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, ePlex® SARS-CoV-2, and the CDC COVID-19 RT-PCR tests. Overall, our studies indicate a comparable analytical performance of the three assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.","Uhteg, Katharine; Jarrett, Junko; Richards, Mahmia; Howard, Craig; Morehead, Elizabeth; Geahr, Melissa; Gluck, Linda; Hanlon, Ann; Ellis, Brandon; Kaur, Harsimar; Simner, Patricia; Carroll, Karen C; Mostafa, Heba H",J Clin Virol,,223

Although less sensitive than molecular detection methods, rapid antigen testing offers the potential for inexpensive, quick, decentralized testing. Robust analytical sensitivity data in comparison to reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) are currently lacking for many rapid antigen tests. Here, we evaluated the analytical sensitivity of the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card using SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical specimens quantified by reverse transcription-droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) and multiple FDA EUA qRT-PCR platforms using RNA standards. Initial and confirmatory limits of detection for the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card were determined to be equivalent to 4.04 × 104 to 8.06 × 104 copies/swab. We further confirmed this limit of detection with 72 additional clinical samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 in either phosphate-buffered saline or viral transport medium. One hundred percent of samples with viral loads of >40,000 copies/swab were detected by rapid antigen testing. These data indicate that the BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag card has an analytical sensitivity approximately equivalent to a generic qRT-PCR cycle threshold (CT ) value of 29 to 30.","Perchetti, Garrett A; Huang, Meei-Li; Mills, Margaret G; Jerome, Keith R; Greninger, Alexander L",J. clin. microbiol,,223
457805,Covid-Spiracy: Old Wine in New Barrels?,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus which caused the COVID-19 pandemic and infected more than 10 million victims and resulted in over 500,000 deaths in 213 countries around the world. Having no symptoms in the first week of infection increases the rate of spreading virus. This increasing rate and consequently increasing number of infected individuals necessitate an immediate development of proper diagnostic methods and effective treatments. To date, no specific treatment is detected for curing COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2, similar to other viruses, needs to interact with the host proteins to reach the host and replicate its genome. Accordingly, host-virus protein-protein interactions' (PPI) identification could be useful in predicting the behavior of virus and designing antiviral drugs. Identification of host-virus PPIs with experimental approaches are so time consumable, and so computational approaches are usually applied. In this study, we developed a new method to predict SARS-CoV-2-human PPIs. Our model is a three-layer network in which the first layer contains the most similar Alphainfluenzavirus proteins to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The second layer contains protein-protein interactions between Alphainfluenzavirus proteins and human proteins. The third layer reveals protein-protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins by using the clustering coefficient network property on the two first layers. For further analysis on the results of our prediction network, we investigated human proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 proteins and report the most central human proteins in human PPI network. Moreover, differentially expressed genes of two available GSE were investigated and PPIs of SARS-CoV-2-human network, the human proteins of which were related to upregulated genes, were reported.","Khorsand, Babak; Savadi, Abdorreza; Naghibzadeh, Mahmoud",Inform Med Unlocked,,223

Thermal density fluctuations in SC-CO2 determine susceptibility and correlation length identifying the Widom line at their maxima. Droplet formation occurs at the gas-liquid line and between 20 and 60 bar above the Widom line, the corresponding borderline identified as the Frenkel line. The droplets start to form spheres of constant radius of &#8776; 45 Å and transform into rods and globules at higher pressure. Droplet formation represents a liquid-liquid (polymorphic) phase transition of the same composition but different density, whose difference defines its order parameter. Polymorphism in CO2 is a new observation stimulating interesting discussions on the topics of gas-like to liquid-like transition in SC fluids and polymorphism since CO2 represents a ""simple"" van der Waals liquid in contrast to water, which is the most widely studied liquid showing polymorphism in its supercooled state.","Pipich, Vitaliy; Schwahn, Dietmar",Sci Rep,,223

METHODS: Fifty T1D patients undergoing continuous/flash glucose monitoring were recruited. The study's primary outcome was the change of time in range (TIR) from before to lockdown period. Three time-point comparisons of TIR, mean glucose levels (MG), estimated (e)HbA1c, time above (TAR) and below range (TBR), moderate/severe hypoglycemic events between pre-lockdown, lockdown and post-lockdown period were also performed. Information on lockdown-associated perceived stress, changes of work status and physical activity were recorded. RESULTS: TIR significantly decreased (75(63-84)% vs.69(50-76)%,p < 0.001) whereas MG (154 ± 15 mg/dl vs.165 ± 25 mg/dl, p = 0.027) and eHbA1c (7.3(6.6-7.8)%vs.7.5(6.7-8.2)%,p = 0.031) increased from pre- to lockdown period; overall glucose control significantly improved when restriction ended. Lockdown-associated work loss/suspension independently predicted impaired TIR after adjustment for potential confounders (Standardizedß: -0.29; 95%C&#921;: -18.7 to -2.25;p = 0.01). Greater TAR, TBR and hypoglycemic events were also reported during the lockdown. CONCLUSION: In T1D Italian individuals, blood glucose control significantly worsened during the COVID-19 lockdown; work instability and related issues represented the main determinant of impaired glucose variability in this population.","Barchetta, Ilaria; Cimini, Flavia Agata; Bertoccini, Laura; Ceccarelli, Valentina; Spaccarotella, Michele; Baroni, Marco Giorgio; Cavallo, Maria Gisella",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,223

Previous studies suggest that the absence of a home crowd changes the home field advantage in terms of match outcomes, offensive performance, and referee decisions. However, because of the small sample sizes, these changes may be random rather than meaningful. To test this, we created 1,000,000 randomized samples from the previous four seasons with the exact same number of matches played behind closed doors in Europe's four most elite soccer leagues at the end of the 2019/2020 season. We found that across countries (Germany, Spain, Italy, and England), performance indices and referee decisions (except red cards) indeed changed to the detriment of the home team beyond the level of chance. However, this overall pattern could be ascribed to specific countries. Most importantly, the proportion of points won by the home teams declined significantly only in Germany, which was accompanied by a meaningful increase in (1) the proportion of goals scored by the away teams and (2) the proportion of yellow cards given to the home teams. We conclude that the home field advantage may indeed be lost when spectators are absent. However, in future studies, more detailed behavioral analyses are needed to determine the robustness and the behavioral determinants of this phenomenon across leagues and countries.","Hill, Y.; Van Yperen, N.

We conducted an anonymous online survey of the U.K. and U.S. public between April 24 and May 12, 2020. Participants (N = 2087) rated 14 COVID-related symptoms in terms of perceived severity and induced worry. They were then asked about their intention to practise social distancing in response to three public health messages: the standard U.K. government message: ""Most people will experience only mild symptoms""; the standard message ""unpacked"" by listing six of those symptoms as examples; and ""Most people will not require hospitalisation."" The unpacked message resulted in the highest intention to comply with social distancing (b = .22 [.04, .40], p = .02) and there was no interaction with country. Worry about symptoms was an independent predictor of intention to comply (b = .02 [.01, .03], p < .001). In the days before lockdown amidst a raging pandemic, the U.K. and U.S. governments sought to reassure the public.

Based on OLS modeling, the survey data are processed through Person correlation and OLS regression analysis. The research results demonstrate that entrepreneurial education is positively correlated with the entrepreneurial intention, even after introducing other explanatory variables like institutional environment and family background, the relationship between entrepreneurial education and entrepreneurial intension is still significant and robust. Contrary to the results of previous studies, institutional environment and family background are found negatively correlated with entrepreneurial intension when entrepreneurial education and self-efficacy are introduced in the OLS model under the multivariate regression method. The study highlights the importance of entrepreneurial education to entrepreneurial intension, as well as provides policy implications to promote entrepreneurship under the impact of COVID-19 based on OLS modeling. © 2020 IEEE.","Zhao, X.; Lin, X.; Hu, Y.

Logarithm transformation of the count variable (COVID-19 cases) was used in a multiple linear regression model to predict the potential effects of weather variables on the prevalence of the disease. The study revealed strong associations (-0.510 &#8804; r &#8804; -0.967; 0.519 &#8804; r &#8804; 0.999) between climatic variables and confirmed cases of COVID-19 in majority (68.85%) of the selected countries. It showed evidences of 1 to 7-day delays in the response of the infection to changes in weather pattern. Model simulations suggested that a unit fall in temperature and humidity could increase (0.04-18.70%) the infection in 19.67% and 16.39% of the countries, respectively, while a general reduction (-0.05 to 9.40%) in infection cases was projected in 14.75% countries with a unit drop in precipitation. In conclusion, the study suggests that effective public health interventions are crucial to containing the projected upsurge in COVID-19 cases during both cold and warm seasons in the southern and northern hemispheres.","Matthew, Olaniran Jonathan; Eludoyin, Adebayo Oluwole; Oluwadiya, Kehinde Sunday",Spat Spatiotemporal Epidemiol,,223

Here, we propose such a method that does not need expensive and complicated equipment. Only a set of hand-held small devices is sufficient. A section along an optic fiber cable is stripped, so that laser light travelling through it will leak outside, while biosensing process taken place on this stripped section can form a new cladding layer of hydrogel, restoring the laser output of the fiber. A short peptide probe immobilized on the stripped section of the fiber can covalently capture a biomarker protein of SARS-Cov-2 from the serum sample. Through the cross-linking of the target protein with the interfering proteins in the serum sample, a hydrogel is covalently immobilized around the stripped section, highly resistant to detergent rinsing that is indispensable for removing nonspecific interference from the clinical sample. Using this ""covalent biosensing"" strategy, only one peptide probe is sufficient to simultaneously achieve ultrahigh affinity toward the biomarker protein of SARS-Cov-2 and effective signal amplification.","Wang, Junxia; Lv, Mengqi; Xia, Hehuan; Du, Jialei; Zhao, Yiwei; Li, Hao; Zhang, Zhongyin",ACS Sens,,223

465476,Update from the American Urological Association's Residents and fellows committee,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the rates of fetal growth restriction (FGR) in singleton and twin pregnancies using singleton and twin-specific birthweight standards. METHODS: The study included liveborn twin and singleton pregnancies between January 2000 and January 2019. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) included gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia. The study outcomes were FGR or small-for-gestational-age (SGA) at birth as assessed using singleton and twin reference charts. RESULTS: The analysis included 1473 twin and 62,432 singleton pregnancies. In singleton pregnancies the risk of PTB <34 weeks without HDP (OR 2.82, p < 0.001), delivery &#8805;34 weeks with HDP (OR 2.38, p < 0.001), and PTB <34 weeks with HDP (OR 13.65, p < 0.001) were significantly higher in the pregnancies complicated by FGR compared to those without. When selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) was assessed using the singleton standard, the risk of PTB <34 weeks without HDP (OR 1.03, p = 0.872), delivery &#8805;34 weeks with HDP (OR 1.36, p = 0.160) were similar in the pregnancies complicated by sFGR compared to those without, while the risk of PTB <34 weeks with HDP (OR 2.41, p = 0.025) was significantly higher in the pregnancies complicated by sFGR compared to those without. When sFGR was assessed using the twin-specific chart, the risk of PTB <34 weeks without HDP (OR 3.55, p < 0.001), delivery &#8805;34 weeks with HDP (OR 3.17, p = 0.004), and PTB <34 weeks with HDP (OR 5.69, p < 0.001) were significantly higher in the pregnancies complicated by sFGR compared to those without. The stronger and more consistent association persisted in the subgroup analyses according to chorionicity. The strength of association in dichorionic twin pregnancies resembles that of the singletons more closely and consistently when the FGR was diagnosed using the twin-specific charts. CONCLUSION: FGR in twin pregnancies has a stronger and more consistent association with HDP and PTB when using twin-specific rather than singleton charts. This study provides further evidence supporting the use of twin-specific charts when assessing fetal growth in twin pregnancies.","Kalafat, Erkan; Abiola, Aisha; Thilaganathan, Basky; Bhide, Amar; Khalil, Asma",,,223
466862,Harnessing multiple models for outbreak management,2020,"Many schools and universities have seen a significant increase in the spread of COVID-19. As such, a number of non-pharmaceutical interventions have been proposed including distancing requirements, surveillance testing, and updating ventilation systems. Unfortunately, there is limited guidance for which policy or set of policies are most effective for a specific school system. We develop a novel approach to model the spread of SARS-CoV-2 quanta in a closed classroom environment that extends traditional transmission models that assume uniform mixing through air recirculation by including the local spread of quanta from a contagious source. In addition, the behavior of students with respect to guideline compliance was modeled through an agent-based simulation. Estimated infection rates were on average lower using traditional transmission models compared to our approach. Further, we found that although ventilation changes were effective at reducing mean transmission risk, it had much less impact than distancing practices. Duration of the class was an important factor in determining the transmission risk. For the same total number of semester hours for a class, delivering lectures more frequently for shorter durations was preferable to less frequently with longer durations. Finally, as expected, as the contact tracing level increased, more infectious students were identified and removed from the environment and the spread slowed, though there were diminishing returns. These findings can help provide guidance as to which school-based policies would be most effective at reducing risk and can be used in a cost/comparative effectiveness estimation study given local costs and constraints.","Zafarnejad, Reyhaneh; Griffin, Paul M",Comput Biol Med,,223

Studies have shown that smokers are less likely to be diagnosed with or be hospitalized for COVID-19 but, once hospitalized, have higher odds for an adverse outcome. We have previously presented the potential interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), due to a ""toxin-like"" epitope on the Spike glycoprotein, with homology to a sequence of a snake venom toxin. This epitope coincides with the well-described cryptic epitope for the human anti-SARS-CoV antibody CR3022. In this study, we present the molecular complexes of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins, at their open or closed conformations, with the model of the human &#945;7 nAChR. We found that all studied protein complexes' interface involves a large part of the ""toxin-like"" sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoproteins and toxin binding site of human &#945;7 nAChR. Our findings provide further support to the hypothesis about the protective role of nicotine and other cholinergic agonists. The potential therapeutic role of CR3022 and other similar monoclonal antibodies with increased affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein against the clinical effects originating from the dysregulated cholinergic pathway should be further explored.","Lagoumintzis, George; Chasapis, Christos T; Alexandris, Nikolaos; Kouretas, Dimitrios; Tzartos, Socrates; Eliopoulos, Elias; Farsalinos, Konstantinos; Poulas, Konstantinos",Food Chem Toxicol,,223

468190,Novel Corona virus disease infection in Tunisia: Mathematical model and the impact of the quarantine strategy,2020,"BPMN is a specification language widely used by industry and researchers for business process modeling and execution. It defines clearly how to articulate its concepts, but do not provide mechanism to represent the semantics of the produced models. This paper addresses the problem of how to improve the expressiveness of BPMN models, proposing a definition for the semantics of a business process within a BPMN model, and improving the completeness of the models in a systematic manner, so that models can describe far more situations with few extra managed complexity. We conceive a framework based on the business transaction patterns available in the enterprise ontology body of knowledge to prescribe the foundations of semantic BPMN models. A tool has been developed to automate the framework. Then, two industrial proof-of-concepts are used to measure its coverage, both positive and negative, and to argue about our proposal's usefulness. After that, the proposal is compared with others using a systematic literature review. A full BPMN pattern is proposed encompassing the happy flow, the declinations, the rejections and the revocations, without adding any new element to the BPMN specification. A software tool has been developed, and made publicly available, to support the automatic generation of the BPMN models from the proposed patterns. Our semantified BPMN pattern allowed the identification of a large amount of implicit, and other not implemented, situations in both proof-of-concepts. It is concluded that the usage of a semantic solution, grounded on a sound pattern, allows the systematic enrichment of the BPMN models with a bounded effort. Moreover, to simplify the BPMN executable models' implementation, its elements could be classified as implicit, explicit, or not implemented yet. Finally, related work indicates that this work is demanded, but no full solutions are available.","Guerreiro, S'ergio; Sousa, Pedro",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09557v1.pdf,223

The extent to which neighborhood characteristics and comorbidity explain these disparities is unclear. Outcomes in Asian American populations have not been explored. Objective: To compare COVID-19 outcomes based on race and ethnicity and assess the association of any disparities with comorbidity and neighborhood characteristics. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study was conducted within the New York University Langone Health system, which includes over 260 outpatient practices and 4 acute care hospitals. All patients within the system's integrated health record who were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 between March 1, 2020, and April 8, 2020, were identified and followed up through May 13, 2020. Data were analyzed in June 2020. Among 11â¯547 patients tested, outcomes were compared by race and ethnicity and examined against differences by age, sex, body mass index, comorbidity, insurance type, and neighborhood socioeconomic status. Exposures: Race and ethnicity categorized using self-reported electronic health record data (ie, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, Asian, and multiracial/other patients). Main Outcomes and Measures: The likelihood of receiving a positive test, hospitalization, and critical illness (defined as a composite of care in the intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, discharge to hospice, or death). Results: Among 9722 patients (mean [SD] age, 50.7 [17.5] years; 58.8% women), 4843 (49.8%) were positive for COVID-19; 2623 (54.2%) of those were admitted for hospitalization (1047 [39.9%] White, 375 [14.3%] Black, 715 [27.3%] Hispanic, 180 [6.9%] Asian, 207 [7.9%] multiracial/other). In fully adjusted models, Black patients (odds ratio [OR], 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.6) and Hispanic patients (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.7) were more likely than White patients to test positive. Among those who tested positive, odds of hospitalization were similar among White, Hispanic, and Black patients, but higher among Asian (OR, 1.6, 95% CI, 1.1-2.3) and multiracial patients (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9) compared with White patients. Among those hospitalized, Black patients were less likely than White patients to have severe illness (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.8) and to die or be discharged to hospice (hazard ratio, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.9). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of patients in a large health system in New York City, Black and Hispanic patients were more likely, and Asian patients less likely, than White patients to test positive; once hospitalized, Black patients were less likely than White patients to have critical illness or die after adjustment for comorbidity and neighborhood characteristics. This supports the assertion that existing structural determinants pervasive in Black and Hispanic communities may explain the disproportionately higher out-of-hospital deaths due to COVID-19 infections in these populations.","Ogedegbe, Gbenga; Ravenell, Joseph; Adhikari, Samrachana; Butler, Mark; Cook, Tiffany; Francois, Fritz; Iturrate, Eduardo; Jean-Louis, Girardin; Jones, Simon A; Onakomaiya, Deborah; Petrilli, Christopher M; Pulgarin, Claudia; Regan, Seann; Reynolds, Harmony; Seixas, Azizi; Volpicelli, Frank Michael; Horwitz, Leora Idit",JAMA Netw Open,,223

We investigate the uptake of (1) video and telephone telehealth consultations in April-May 2020, and (2) the overall changing rates of consultation, i.e. total telehealth and in-person consultations across the larger states of Australia. METHOD: MBS item service data were extracted for COVID-19 psychiatrist video- and telephone-telehealth item numbers and compared with a baseline of the 2018-2019-financial-year monthly average of in-person consultations for New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia. RESULTS: Total psychiatry consultations (telehealth and in-person) rose during the first wave of the pandemic by 10%-20% compared to the previous year. The majority of private practice was conducted by telehealth in April but was lower in May as new COVID-19 case rates fell. Most telehealth provision was by telephone for short consultations of â©½15-30 min. Video consultations increased from April into May. CONCLUSIONS: For large states, there has been a rapid adoption of the MBS telehealth psychiatrist items, followed by a trend back to face-to-face as COVID-19 new case rates reduced.

471670,Spotlight on… contraception,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is an autoimmune photosensitive disorder that affects the skin. CLE lesions can have signs of skin damage including dyspigmentation, scarring, atrophy and/or alopecia. Disease damage secondary to CLE can be cosmetically disfiguring and causes patients significant distress. While many current treatments for CLE focus primarily on reducing inflammation, there are few options for managing disease damage. Providers currently lack strong guidance on managing CLE damage due to the paucity of literature on this topic. Because of this knowledge gap, we aim to provide an overview of what is currently known about the pathogenesis and management of signs of disease damage in CLE. METHODS: In this narrative review, Pubmed, Ovid Medline, and Google scholar were searched for relevant articles assessing pathogenesis and treatment of disease damage. RESULTS: Therapeutic options for CLE damage, including hyperpigmentation (laser and camouflage), hypopigmentation (melanocyte grafting and camouflage), scarring (laser, dermabrasion and camouflage), atrophy (filler, fat transplantation and flap procedures) and scarring alopecia (hair transplantation and camouflage) were identified. We found that investigations of therapeutics for CLE disease damage primarily consist of case reports and small case series. Reported adverse events due to treatment for CLE disease damage range from temporary erythema and discomfort to disease reactivation and pigmentary defects. CONCLUSIONS: There are various treatments for disease damage for each sign of disease damage. However, more robust investigations are needed to assess disease pathogenesis and improve treatments of disease damage due to CLE.","Joseph, Adrienne K; Abbas, Laila F; Chong, Benjamin F",Dermatol Ther,,223

There are several factors involved in the epidemic spreading, such as the individual characteristics of each city/country. The true shape of the epidemic dynamics is a large, complex system, considerably hard to predict. In this context, Complex networks are a great candidate for analyzing these systems due to their ability to tackle structural and dynamic properties. Therefore, this study presents a new approach to model the COVID-19 epidemic using a multi-layer complex network, where nodes represent people, edges are social contacts, and layers represent different social activities. The model improves the traditional SIR, and it is applied to study the Brazilian epidemic considering data up to 05/26/2020, and analyzing possible future actions and their consequences. The network is characterized using statistics of infection, death, and hospitalization time. To simulate isolation, social distancing, or precautionary measures, we remove layers and reduce social contact's intensity. Results show that even taking various optimistic assumptions, the current isolation levels in Brazil still may lead to a critical scenario for the healthcare system and a considerable death toll (average of 149,000). If all activities return to normal, the epidemic growth may suffer a steep increase, and the demand for ICU beds may surpass three times the country's capacity. This situation would surely lead to a catastrophic scenario, as our estimation reaches an average of 212,000 deaths, even considering that all cases are effectively treated.

We also use long-term average (2000-2017) of AOD for March-May to identify existing hotspot regions and to compare the variations observed in 2019 and 2020. The aim of the present work is to identify the pollution hotspot regions in India that existed during the lockdown and understanding the future projection scenarios reported by previous studies in light of the present findings. We have incorporated Menn-Kendall trend analysis to understand the AOD trends over India and percentage change in AOD, NO2 and SO2 to identify air pollution pattern changes during the lockdown. The results indicate higher air pollution levels over eastern India over the coal-fired power plants clusters. By considering the earlier projected studies, our results suggest that eastern India will have higher levels of air pollution, making it a new hotspot region for air pollution with highest magnitudes.","Tyagi, Bhishma; Choudhury, Goutam; Vissa, Naresh Krishna; Singh, Jyotsna; Tesche, Matthias",Environ Pollut,,223

The phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA genes demonstrated that strain WT00CT was a member of the genus Herbaspirillum. This strain is microaerobic, gram-negative and non-pigmented, and its cells are rod shaped, with a polar flagellum. It grew optimally at 34-37 °C, pH 5.0-8.0 and 0-1.5% NaCl (w/v). The G + C content of its genomic DNA was 62.36 mol%. C16:0, iso-C15:0, iso-C17:0, anteiso-C15:0 and anteiso-C17:0 were major fatty acids. The strain WT00CT contained six polar lipids, namely DPG (diphosphatidylglycerol), PE (phosphatidylethanolamine), PG (phosphatidylglycerol), PC (phosphatidylcholine), GL (glycolipid) and APL (aminophospholipids), and its respiratory quinone was Q8. The strain WT00CT had a genome size of 6.08 Mb with a total ORF of 5,537, in which one gene cluster (36 genes) encoding a type IV secretion system was absent in other members of the Herbaspirillum genus. ANI values of genomic comparison between the strain WT00CT and other Herbaspirillum species were 75-96%. Based on the phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic data presented here, the strain WT00CT represents a novel species in the Herbaspirillum genus, for which the name Herbaspirillum camelliae sp. nov. is proposed.

Aims: We here analyzed workflow time intervals and functional outcomes of LVO patients treated with endovascular thrombectomy (ET) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Methods: We compared the frequency, pre- and intrahospital workflow time intervals, rates of reperfusion, and functional outcome of patients admitted from March 1st to May 31st 2020 with patients admitted during the same time interval in 2019 to 12 university and municipal hospitals across Germany (N = 795). Results: The number of LVO patients treated with ET between March to May 2020 was similar when compared to the same interval in 2019. Direct-to-center patients and patients admitted through interhospital transfer in 2020 showed similar pre- and intrahospital workflow time intervals compared to patients admitted in 2019, except for a longer door-to-groin time in patients admitted through interhospital transfer in 2020 (47 min vs 38 min, p = 0.005). Rates of reperfusion were not significantly different between 2020 and 2019. Functional outcome at discharge of LVO patients treated in 2020 was not significantly different compared to patients treated in 2019. Conclusion: Pre- and intrahospital workflows, ET efficacy, and functional outcome of LVO patients treated with ET were not affected during the COVID-19 pandemic in our large cohort from centers across Germany.","Tiedt, Steffen; Bode, Felix J; Uphaus, Timo; Alegiani, Anna; Gröschel, Klaus; Petzold, Gabor C",Neurol Res Pract,,223

475464,Construction of benchmark retinal image database for diabetic retinopathy analysis,2020,"Paraviral eruptions, such as the papular-purpuric gloves and socks syndrome or eruptive pseudoangiomatosis, share the following features that distinguish them from a classic viral eruption: they are highly recognizable; the eruption usually lasts a few weeks; many different viruses and sometimes other agents can trigger them; on microscopic examination, there is no specific cytopathogenic viral effect. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can induce both a classic viral eruption and a paraviral eruption, the meaning of which in terms of pathophysiology and prognosis is very different. Some patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a papulovesicular eruption involving mainly the trunk. Those patients have active viremia, and some have developed pneumonia and died. Biopsy of the eruption revealed cytopathogenic viral effect, and thus there is a direct interaction of the virus with the skin; it is, therefore, a classic viral exanthema. Others, mainly young patients, developed chilblains of the fingers and toes 3 or 4 weeks after minor signs of COVID-19 or after contact with a diseased person. They did not develop severe COVID-19. Biopsy revealed classic findings of chilblains without cytopathogenic viral effect. Most of those patients did not develop specific antibodies. Those chilblains can be considered as paraviral. Classic viral manifestations are the consequence of a direct interaction of the skin with the virus, whereas paraviral manifestations result from the activation of the immune system. In the case of paraviral chilblains, I hypothesize that it is the innate immune system that rejects SARS-CoV-2. Chilblains are also observed in rare monogenic disorders called type 1 interferonopathies, where antiviral innate imunity is abormally activated. This would explain why these individuals do not develop specific antibodies, because they are probably naturally resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection via their innate immuen system.","Lipsker, Dan",Clin.

In particular, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic underscores the urgent need for developing recyclable facemasks due to the considerable environmental damage and health risks imposed by disposable masks and respirators. We demonstrate synthesis of nanoporous membranes comprising carbon dots (C-dots) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), and demonstrate their potential use for recyclable, self-sterilized facemasks. Notably, the composite C-dot-PVDF films exhibit hydrophobic surface which prevents moisture accumulation and a compact nanopore network which allows both breathability as well as effective filtration of particles above 100 nm in diameter. Particularly important, self-sterilization occurs upon short solar irradiation of the membrane, as the embedded C-dots efficiently absorb visible light, concurrently giving rise to elevated temperatures through heat dissipation.","Singh, Seema; Shauloff, Nitzan; Sharma, Chetan Prakash; Shimoni, Ran; Arnusch, Christopher J; Jelinek, Raz",J Colloid Interface Sci,,223

The structure of the ACE2-S-protein complex has been deciphered and we focused on the 27 ACE2 residues that bind to S-protein. From human sequence databases, we identified 9 ACE2 variants at ACE2-S-protein binding sites. We used both experimental assays and protein structure analysis to evaluate the effect of each variant on the binding affinity of ACE2 to S-protein. We found one variant causing complete binding disruption, two and three variants, respectively, strongly and mildly reducing the binding affinity, and two variants strongly enhancing the binding affinity. We then collected the ACE2 gene sequences from 57 non-human primates. Among the six apes and 20 Old World monkeys (OWMs) studied we found no new variants. In contrast, all 11 New World monkeys (NWMs) studied share four variants each causing a strong reduction in binding affinity, the Philippine tarsier also possesses three such variants, and 18 of the 19 prosimian species studied share one variant causing a strong reduction in binding affinity. Moreover, one OWM and three prosimian variants increased binding affinity by > 50%. Based on these findings we proposed that the common ancestor of primates was strongly resistant to and that of NWMs was completely resistant to SARS-CoV-2 and so is the Philippine tarsier, whereas apes and OWMs, like most humans, are susceptible.

EBSeq algorithm was applied to analyze the data, and genes were considered to be significantly differentially expressed if the false discovery rate value was <0.05, the P value was <0.01, and the fold change was >0.585. The results revealed that 253 genes were differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (170 genes were upregulated, and 83 were downregulated) and more than 100 DEGs were probably associated with intramuscular fat deposition, tenderness, and toughness, which are driving the meat quality and were involved in biological processes such as collagen synthesis, cell differentiation, and muscle tissue and fiber development; molecular functions such as chemokine activity and collagen activity; cellular components such as cytoplasm and myofibril; and pathways such as collagen signaling and metabolic pathways. A gene-act network and a co-expression network revealed the close relationship between intramuscular fat deposition and meat tenderness. The expressions of 20 DEGs were validated by real-time PCR, and the results suggested that the DEGs are correlated with RNA-seq data and play crucial roles in muscle growth, development processes, toughness, and tenderness of the meat. Together, the genome-wide transcriptome analysis revealed that various genes are responsible for toughness and tenderness variance in the difference muscles of beef.","Ramalingam, Vaikundamoorthy; Hwang, Inho",J. agric.

477464,Reply to Gonzalez et al,2020,"As a result of a long colonial history and subsequent developmental and economic challenges, many African countries have struggled to put in place adequate policies, systems, and associated infrastructures to address the health and social needs of their citizens. With the COVID-19 pandemic threatening human lives and livelihoods, concerns are raised about the preparedness and readiness of health policies and systems in African countries to deal with these kinds of health calamities. More particularly, questions can be asked about the preparedness or even existence of mental health policies and associated systems to help individuals and communities in Africa to deal with the consequences of COVID-19 and other health emergencies. In this article, we analyse the existing mental health policies of four African countries paying attention to the capacity of these legislative provisions to enable psychology professionals to deal with psychosocial problems brought about by COVID-19. We use Walt and Gilson’s Policy Triangle Framework to frame our analysis of the existing mental health policies. In line with this conceptual framework, we review the role played by the different factors in shaping and influencing these mental health policies. We further explore the challenges and opportunities associated with existing legislation and mental health policies. We also reflect on the reports obtained from each of the four countries about the role that psychologists are playing to deal with the associated psychosocial problems. Based on our policy analysis and country reports, we highlight strengths and gaps in these policies and give recommendations on how mental health policies in these countries can be strengthened to respond to COVID-19 and future health emergencies.

477832,Editor's Note,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV-2 virus) is the defying global health crisis of our time. The absence of mass testing and the relevant presence of asymptomatic individuals causes the available data of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil to be largely under-reported regarding the number of infected individuals and deaths. We propose an adapted Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model which explicitly incorporates the under-reporting and the response of the population to public policies (such as confinement measures, widespread use of masks, etc) to cast short-term and long-term predictions. Large amounts of uncertainty could provide misleading models and predictions. In this paper, we discuss the role of uncertainty in these prediction, which is illustrated regarding three key aspects. First, assuming that the number of infected individuals is under-reported, we demonstrate an anticipation regarding the peak of infection. Furthermore, while a model with a single class of infected individuals yields forecasts with increased peaks, a model that considers both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals suggests a decrease of the peak of symptomatic. Second, considering that the actual amount of deaths is larger than what is being register, then demonstrate the increase of the mortality rates. Third, when consider generally under-reported data, we demonstrate how the transmission and recovery rate model parameters change qualitatively and quantitatively. We also investigate the effect of the""COVID-19 under-reporting tripod"", i.e. the under-reporting in terms of infected individuals, of deaths and the true mortality rate. If two of these factors are known, the remainder can be inferred, as long as proportions are kept constant. The proposed approach allows one to determine the margins of uncertainty by assessments on the observed and true mortality rates.","Bastos, Saulo B.; Morato, Marcelo M.; Normey-Rico, Daniel O.

The initial outbreak was of considerable size first in China subsequently spread to the rest of the world. Immediately after the epidemic (which according to the World Health Organization had risen to pandemic status), the problem of whether or not to update the occupational risk assessment arose, also considering how the biological risk from SARS CoV-2 should be understood: specific or generic. To this end, we conducted a literature review to identify national health legislation and policies, examining how Italy has addressed the COVID-19 emergency in occupational health planning, in order to develop considerations on the need to update the Risk Assessment Document following the pandemic status. The data that emerged from the review of current legislation allowed us to conclude that the risk from SARS-CoV-2 is in most work activities to be understood as a generic or aggravated generic risk, requiring the employer to apply and control the preventive measures suggested by health authorities to contain the spread of the virus.","Cirrincione, Luigi; Rapisarda, Venerando; Mazzucco, Walter; Provenzano, Rosanna; Cannizzaro, Emanuele",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,223

This disease, which has morphed into a global pandemic, has mobilized outrageous outpouring action worldwide. Despite international and local media attention coupled with overwhelming new facts replete with misinformation and disinformation on COVID-19 from many channels;including interpersonal and social media, efforts to scale up control measures have yielded mixed results. The government and Kenyan media have reported several cases in which the public and leaders flouted these measures thus putting themselves at risk of contracting or spreading the virus. The overarching question is: does fear-arousing communication really matter in behaviour change particularly during a global pandemic of the magnitude of COVID-19? This qualitative study therefore examined the effects of COVID-19 messages on health behaviour change among residents living in the Municipality of Busia, one of the towns that have recorded the highest incidences of confirmed COVID-19 cases as informed by the Extended Parallel Process and Health Belief behavioural change models. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were carried out to establish threat and coping appraisal as a result of COVID-19 messages received from different sources. The study employed a risk behaviour diagnosis assessment that focused on two components of health risk messages, that is, threat and recommended response that addresses efficacy issues. This study found out that despite universal knowledge of COVID-19 and prevention methods, perceived threat especially perceived vulnerability to the virus was low due to misinformation, disinformation and disjointed communication.","Emojong, O.",Journal of African Media Studies,,223

METHODS: A total of 95 paired DBS and serum samples were collected from 74 participants (aged 1-63 years) as part of a household cohort study in Melbourne, Australia. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies specific for the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and S1 proteins between serum and eluates from DBS specimens were compared using an FDA-approved ELISA method. RESULTS: Among the 74 participants, 42% (31/74) were children and the rest were adults. A total of 16 children and 13 adults were SARS-CoV-2 positive by polymerase chain reaction. The IgG seropositivity rate was similar between serum and DBS specimens (18.9% (18/95) versus 16.8% (16/95)), respectively. Similar RBD and S1-specific IgG levels were detected between serum and DBS specimens. Serum IgG levels strongly correlated with DBS IgG levels (r = 0.99, P < 0.0001) for both SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Furthermore, antibodies remained stable in DBS specimens for >3 months. CONCLUSIONS: DBS specimens can be reliably used as an alternative to serum samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurement. The use of DBS specimens would facilitate serosurveillance efforts particularly in hard-to-reach populations and inform public health responses including COVID-19 vaccination strategies.","Toh, Zheng Quan; Higgins, Rachel A; Anderson, Jeremy; Mazarakis, Nadia; Do, Lien Anh Ha; Rautenbacher, Karin; Ramos, Pedro; Dohle, Kate; Tosif, Shidan; Crawford, Nigel; Mulholland, Kim; Licciardi, Paul V",J. public health (Oxf),,223

Identification of User Needs for Model Explanations Based on Human-Model Conversations,2020-02-07,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is characterized by various clinical manifestations, mainly respiratory involvement. Disease-related malnutrition is associated with impaired respiratory function and increased all-cause morbidity and mortality. Patients with COVID-19 infection carry a high nutritional risk. After designing a specific nutritional support protocol for this disease, we carried out a retrospective study on malnutrition and on the use of nutritional support in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study to determine whether nutritional support positively affected hospital stay, clinical complications, and mortality in patients with COVID-19. We compared the results with those of standard nutritional management. Our secondary objectives were to determine the prevalence of malnutrition in patients with COVID-19 and the value of nutritional support in the hospital where the study was performed. RESULTS: At least 60% of patients with COVID-19 experience malnutrition (up to 78.66% presented at least 1 of the parameters studied). The specialized nutritional support protocol was indicated in only 21 patients (28%) and was started early in only 12 patients (16%). Hospital stay was significantly shorter in patients managed with the early protocol (5.09 days, 95% CI, 1.338-8.853, p<0.01). Similarly, in this group, respiratory distress was less severe and less frequent (41% vs 82.5%, p<0.007), and statistically significantly fewer complications were recorded (9/12 vs 91/63; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with high rates of disease-related malnutrition. Early implementation of a specialized nutritional support plan can improve the prognosis of these patients by reducing hospital stay, the possibility of more severe respiratory distress, and complications in general.","Morán-López, Jesús Manuel",,,223
480145,Situational Confidence Assistance for Lifelong Shared Autonomy,2021-04-14,"Following the several episodes of zoonotic disease outbreaks and the more recent COVID-19 pandemic, the Indian policy initiatives are committed to institutionalize One Health (OH) approaches and promote intersectoral, transdisciplinary collaboration and cooperation. The OH principle needs to be visualized beyond the scope of zoonoses. While conservation, ecological and veterinary professions are getting increasingly engaged with OH, most of the medical/clinical and social sciences professions are only peripherally aware of its nuances. The OH initiatives, by their essentially multidisciplinary nature, entail working across ministries and navigating tacit institutional hierarchies and allocating leadership roles. The logical operational step will be the constitution of One Health Committees (OHC) at the State and district levels. Here, we outline the key foundational principles of OHC and hope that the framework for implementation shall be deliberated through wider consultations and piloted and adopted in a phased manner.","Dasgupta, Rajib; Tomley, Fiona; Alders, Robyn; Barbuddhe, Sukhadeo B; Kotwani, Anita",Indian J Med Res,,223

483572,Unraveling the molecular crosstalk between Atherosclerosis and COVID-19 comorbidity,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Good hand hygienic practices are considered an important factor to curb the transmission and emergence of SARS-CoV -2. Various studies, conducted previously during the outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have ascertained the effectiveness of adopting good hand hygienic practices to curb the emergence of these viruses. This study aims to explore public hand hygienic practices during the peak pandemic period. METHOD: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among the general population of Pakistan to investigate the knowledge and perception about hand hygiene, self-reported hand hygiene practices, adherence to hand hygienic guidelines, and barriers to optimal hand hygiene. Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Regression model were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in area-based knowledge (P = 0.026), beliefs (P = 0.027), and practices (P = 0.002) regarding hand hygiene. The results of regression analysis revealed that people in urban areas were more likely to have better knowledge (ß = 0.108, CI = 0.076 - 0.05, P = 0.008) and better adherence (ß = 0.115, CI = 0.514 - 2.68, P = 0.004) to hand hygienic practices. CONCLUSION: Advertisements on television and other electronic media with appealing slogans could be effective in making people more compliant to optimal hand hygienic practices.","Yaseen, Muhammad Osama; Saif, Arifa; Khan, Tahir Mehmood; Yaseen, Misha",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,223

The objective of this study is to compare LUS and chest computed tomography (CT) results in COVID-19 survivors with the intent of defining the utility of LUS for long-term follow-up of COVID-19 respiratory disease. METHODS: Prospective observational study that enrolled consecutive survivors of COVID-19 with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (HARF) admitted to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit. Three months following hospital discharge, patients underwent LUS, chest CT, body plethysmography and laboratory testing, the comparison of which forms the basis of this report. RESULTS: 38 patients were enrolled, with a total of 190 lobes analysed: men 27/38 (71.1%), mean age 60.6 y (SD 10.4). LUS findings and pulmonary function tests outcomes were compared between patients with and without ILD, showing a statistically significant difference in terms of LUS score (p: 0.0002), FEV1 (p: 0.0039) and FVC (p: 0.012). ROC curve both in lobe by lobe and in patient's overall analysis revealed an outstanding ILD discrimination ability of LUS (AUC: 0.94 and 0.95 respectively) with a substantial Cohen's coefficient (K: 0.74 and 0.69). CONCLUSIONS: LUS has an outstanding discrimination ability compared to CT in identifying an ILD of at least mild grade in the post COVID-19 follow-up. LUS should be considered as the first-line tool in follow-up programs, while chest CT could be performed based on LUS findings.","Giovannetti, Guido; De Michele, Lucrezia; De Ceglie, Michele; Pierucci, Paola; Mirabile, Alessandra; Vita, Marco; Palmieri, Vincenzo Ostilio; Carpagnano, Giovanna Elisiana; Scardapane, Arnaldo; D039,; Agostino, Carlo",Respir Med,,223
484868,On a Network SIS Epidemic Model with Cooperative and Antagonistic Opinion Dynamics,2021-02-25,"Background: Many studies have been carried out in modelling COVID-19 pandemic. However, region-wise average duration of recovery from COVID-19 has not been attempted; hence, an effort has been made to estimate state-wise recovery duration of India's COVID-19 patients. Determining the recovery time in each region is intended to assist healthcare professionals in providing better care and planning of logistics. Methods: This study used database provided by Kaggle, which takes data from the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The simple Linear Regression model between incidence, prevalence, and duration was used to assess the duration of COVID-19 disease in various Indian states. Results: The fitted model suits ideal for most of the states, except for some union territories and northeastern states. The average time to recover from disease was ranging from 5 to 36 days in Indian states/union territories except for Madhya Pradesh. Tamil Nadu has an average recovery time of 7 days with an value of 0.96, followed by Odisha, Karnataka, West Bengal, Kerala and Chhattisgarh and the average recovery duration was estimated as 7, 13, 17, 11, 14 and 12 days respectively. Conclusion: The average recovery from COVID-19 was ten or less days in twenty percentage of states, whereas in forty-four percentage of states/union territories had an average recovery duration between ten to twenty days. However, around twentyfour percentage of states/union territory recovered between twenty to thirty days. In the rest of Indian states/union territories, the average duration of recovery was more than thirty days.","George, Noel; Tyagi, Naresh K; Prasad, Jang Bahadur",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,,223

486806,A New Prediction of Daily Number of New Cases and Total Number Infected for nCOVID-19 Plague Infections In Indonesia with the Modification of the Bernoulli Differential Equation,2020-04-28,"BACKGROUND: Despite severe outbreaks of COVID-19 among colleges and universities across the USA during the Fall 2020 semester, the majority of institutions did not routinely test students. While high-frequency repeated testing is considered the most effective strategy for disease mitigation, most institutions do not have the necessary infrastructure or funding for implementation. Therefore, alternative strategies for testing the student population are needed. Our study detailed the implementation and results of testing strategies to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread on a university campus, and we aimed to assess the relative effectiveness of the different testing strategies. METHODS: For this retrospective cohort study, we included 6273 on-campus students arriving to a large public university in the rural USA (Clemson, SC, USA) for in-person instruction in the Fall 2020 semester (Sept 21 to Nov 25). Individuals arriving after Sept 23, those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before Aug 19, and student athletes and band members were not included in this study. We implemented two testing strategies to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread during this period: a novel surveillance-based informative testing (SBIT) strategy, consisting of random surveillance testing to identify outbreaks in residence hall buildings or floors and target them for follow-up testing (Sept 23 to Oct 5); followed by a repeated weekly surveillance testing (Oct 6 to Nov 22). Relative changes in estimated weekly prevalence were examined. We developed SARS-CoV-2 transmission models to compare the relative effectiveness of weekly testing (900 daily surveillance tests), SBIT (450 daily surveillance tests), random surveillance testing (450 daily surveillance tests), and voluntary testing (0 daily surveillance tests) on disease mitigation. Model parameters were based on our empirical surveillance data in conjunction with published sources. FINDINGS: SBIT was implemented from Sept 23 to Oct 5, and identified outbreaks in eight residence hall buildings and 45 residence hall floors. Targeted testing of residence halls was 2·03 times more likely to detect a positive case than random testing (95% CI 1·67-2·46). Weekly prevalence was reduced from a peak of 8·7% to 5·6% during this 2-week period, a relative reduction of 36% (95% CI 27-44). Prevalence continued to decrease after implementation of weekly testing, reaching 0·8% at the end of in-person instruction (week 9). SARS-CoV-2 transmission models concluded that, in the absence of SBIT (ie, voluntary testing only), the total number of COVID-19 cases would have increased by 154% throughout the semester. Compared with SBIT, random surveillance testing alone would have resulted in a 24% increase in COVID-19 cases. Implementation of weekly testing at the start of the semester would have resulted in 36% fewer COVID-19 cases throughout the semester compared with SBIT, but it would require twice the number of daily tests. INTERPRETATION: It is imperative that institutions rigorously test students during the 2021 academic year. When high-frequency testing (eg, weekly) is not possible, SBIT is an effective strategy to mitigate disease spread among the student population that can be feasibly implemented across colleges and universities.

Unprecedented Times and Lessons Learned,2021,"Objectives: Herbal medicine (HM) is attracting attention for treating atopic dermatitis (AD). This overview was conducted to summarize and critically evaluate the current systematic reviews (SRs) on HM for the treatment of AD. Methods: Through comprehensive searches, all relevant SRs on HM for AD published until May 2020 were included. The quality of included SRs was assessed using the AMSTAR-2 tool. Moreover, original randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included in the SRs were resynthesized to investigate the efficacy and safety of oral HM for AD. The quality of evidence for the main findings was evaluated using the GRADE approach. Results: Nine SRs were included in this overview. HM showed significantly better efficacy in terms of total effective rate (TER), itching and sleep symptom scores, quality of life, and the dose of topical treatment used compared with placebo. HM as a monotherapy and/or an adjunctive therapy to conventional medication (CM) showed significantly better results on the efficacy, symptom relief, and some laboratory parameters related to the inflammatory response. The methodological quality was generally low. When 58 original RCTs were reanalyzed, HM showed significantly lower SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score and higher TER than the placebo or CM. In terms of the safety profile, HM was not significantly different from the placebo and was better than CM. The quality of evidence ranged from ""moderate"" to ""very low."" Conclusion: The results suggested that HM as a monotherapy or an adjunctive therapy is promising for the treatment of AD. However, due to low methodological quality and low quality of evidence, further rigorous, well-designed, high-quality SRs, and RCTs are needed to make clinical recommendations on HM use.","Kwon, Chan-Young; Lee, Boram; Kim, Suran; Lee, Jaesuk; Park, Minjung; Kim, Namkwen",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,,223

488671,Elsevier OA CC-By Corpus,2020-08-03,"Purpose: Though efforts to curtail the spread of COVID-19 have flattened the curve, it has had a deleterious impact on not only medical education, but also the residency application process. New limitations have severely restricted applicants. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact that a webinar with residency program directors had on medical student applicants’ confidence in applying to interventional radiology residency programs during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Materials and Methods: Medical students were invited to attend a virtual webinar with multiple residency program directors to discuss the application process. Of the 95 survey responders, the percentages of MD, DO, and IMG candidates were 69.5%, 21.0%, and 9.5%, respectively. Furthermore, 58.9% were expected to graduate in 2021, 21.1% in 2022, and 17.9% in 2023;2.1% graduated in 2020. Prior to and directly after the webinar discussion, attendees were asked to fill out a survey evaluating their aplomb in and knowledge of the application process. A Likert scale was used to measure responses to each statement. Comparative analyses were accomplished via two-sample t tests. Results: The data was stratified between applicants who were expected to apply in 2021 and those who plan on applying in ensuing years. The Likert scale was organized such that each response was assigned a number between one and four: one for “strongly disagree” and four for “strongly agree.” Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in all survey results (α &lt; 0.05). Comparing pre- and post-webinar responses, applicants had a significantly improved conception of what they must do both prior to and during the application process (P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, applicants reported a significantly greater degree of confidence in the NRMP (P &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: In this study, it was found that the virtual webinar did have a significant positive impact on applicants’ assurance in and understanding of the NRMP. Furthermore, fears concerning new limitations imposed upon applicants – such as not being able to pursue away rotations – were also alleviated. Interventional radiology is one of the most competitive specialties, with the highest applicant to available position ratio of 4.53 and the 7th highest average USMLE Step 1 score. Thus, the dissemination of appropriate information to applicants is integral to their success. Overall, this analysis suggests that virtual webinars and program director communication are a powerful tool that can promote applicants’ confidence in and knowledge of the NRMP in the face of the COVID-19 Pandemic and its concomitant challenges.","Khayat, A.; Abboud, R.; Farag, A.; Vatakencherry, G.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,,223

We determined the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and characterized the symptoms of patients with mild COVID-19. METHODS: Study participants were recruited from a community facility designated for the isolation of patients without moderate-to-severe symptoms of COVID-19 in South Korea. The prevalence of asymptomatic patients at admission and the detailed symptoms of mild COVID-19 were evaluated through a questionnaire-based survey. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Of the 213 individuals with COVID-19, 41 (19.2%) were asymptomatic until admission. Among the remaining patients with mild COVID-19, the most common symptom was cough (40.1%; 69/172), followed by hyposmia (39.5%; 68/172) and sputum (39.5%; 68/172). Of the 68 individuals with hyposmia, 61 (90%) had accompanying symptoms such as hypogeusia, nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea. Fever (>37.5°C) was only observed in 20 (11.6%) individuals. CONCLUSIONS: As much as one-fifth of individuals with COVID-19 remained asymptomatic from exposure to admission. Hyposmia was quite frequent among individuals with mild COVID-19, but fever was not. Social distancing should be strongly implemented to prevent disease transmission from asymptomatic individuals or those with mild and inconspicuous symptoms.","Kim, G-U; Kim, M-J; Ra, S H; Lee, J; Bae, S; Jung, J; Kim, S-H",Clin Microbiol Infect,,223

Estimates using data up to March 20th, 2020, point to 916,000 (90% UI: 508 K, 1.5 M) cumulative cases and 15,485 (90% UI: 8.4 K, 25.8 K) total deaths, numbers an order of magnitude higher than official statistics. Our projections suggest that absent strong sustaining of contact reductions the epidemic may resurface. We also use data and studies from the succeeding months to reflect on the quality of original estimates.

This case study examines the COVID-19 school closure-related changes to the professional life of a secondary school teacher in rural Alaska (United States), who had to teach his students online. A descriptive and explanatory single case study methodology was used to describe subsequent impacts on instructional practices and workload. Qualitative and quantitative data sources include participant observations, semi-structured interviews, artifacts (e.g., lesson plans, schedules, online time), and open-ended conversations. The results of this study demonstrate an increase and change in workload for the teacher and that online education can support learning for many students but needs to be carefully designed and individualized to not deepen inequality and social divides. The forced move to online learning may have been the catalyst to create a new, more effective hybrid model of educating students in the future. Not one single model for online learning will provide equitable educational opportunities for all and virtual learning cannot be seen as a cheap fix for the ongoing financial crisis in funding education.","Kaden, Ute",Educ.

Twenty participants comprising rural women and social workers were selected using purposive and convenience sampling techniques. Data were collected using focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The Thematic Content Analysis was followed to analyse the data from which the findings were derived. This study established that the COVID-19 pandemic is enhancing the catastrophic implications created by climate change on rural women whose food security systems are shattered, livelihood strategies maimed, caregiving roles burgeoning, and access to healthcare systems compromised. This daunting double impact is aggravated by gender inequalities, social exclusion and patriarchal dominance. The centrality of social justice to social work connotes that the profession has a tendentious responsibility to stand in the gap and liberate women from the jaws of these double catastrophes (climate change and COVID-19).","Nyahunda, Louis; Chibvura, Shyleen; Tirivangasi, Happy Mathew",J Hum Rights Soc Work,,223
496188,A little better all the time in 2021,2021,"Background and Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), became a global health issue that influenced the lives of billions of people all over the world. The goal of this study was to investigate the clinical findings and routine laboratory evaluations of COVID-19 patients in both average-and high-altitude settings in Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: A comparative study to explore the clinical characteristics and Laboratory tests results of COVID-19 patients at both high and average altitudes in Saudi Arabia has been conducted. The study included a total number of 103 patients (53 patients comprising the high-altitude group living in Taif, Saudi Arabia and 50 patients comprising the average-altitude group living in Al Ahsa, Saudi Arabia) were included in the study. Patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2-positive by PCR test. Clinical characteristics, laboratory test results and symptoms of adult patients were collected and expressed as mean and standard deviation. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software to compare between both groups and significance was considered when the p-value is less than 0.05. Results: Approximately 55.3% of the total cases were male with a mean age of 40.16±12.47 years. There were highly statistically significant differences between the groups in age, heart rate (p&lt;0.001). There were also statistically significant differences between the groups in temperature, SpO2, fever, myalgia, shortness of breath and loss of smell and taste. Conclusion: The current study provides an understanding of the clinical and laboratory investigations of COVID-19 patients in two regions (high altitude and average altitude) in Saudi Arabia. © 2021 Ahmad El Askary et al.","El Askary, A.; Almehmadi, M.; Halawi, M.; Al-Hejji, L.

496660,Review of fractional epidemic models,2021,"Background It is unknown if there are cardiac abnormalities in persons who have recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) without cardiac symptoms or in those who have normal biomarkers and normal electrocardiograms. Purpose To evaluate cardiac involvement in participants who had recovered from COVID-19 without clinical evidence of cardiac involvement by using cardiac MRI. Materials and Methods This prospective observational cohort study included 40 participants who had recovered from COVID-19 with moderate (n = 24) or severe (n = 16) pneumonia and who had no cardiovascular medical history, were without cardiac symptoms, had normal electrocardiograms, had normal serologic cardiac enzyme levels, and had been discharged for more than 90 days between May and September 2020. Demographic characteristics were recorded, serum cardiac enzyme levels were measured, and cardiac MRI was performed. Cardiac function, native T1, extracellular volume fraction (ECV), and two-dimensional (2D) strain were quantitatively evaluated and compared with values in control subjects (n = 25). Comparisons among the three groups were performed by using one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni-corrected post hoc comparisons (for normal distribution) or Kruskal-Wallis tests with post hoc pairwise comparisons (for nonnormal distribution). Results Forty participants (mean age, 54 years ± 12 [standard deviation]; 24 men) were enrolled; participants had a mean time between admission and cardiac MRI of 158 days ± 18 and between discharge and cardiac MRI examination of 124 days ± 17. There were no left or right ventricular size or functional differences between participants who had recovered from COVID-19 and healthy control subjects. Only one (3%) participant had positive late gadolinium enhancement located at the mid inferior wall. Global ECV values were elevated in participants who had recovered from COVID-19 with moderate or severe pneumonia compared with those in healthy control subjects (median ECV, 29.7% vs 31.4% vs 25.0%, respectively; interquartile range, 28.0%-32.9% vs 29.3%-34.0% vs 23.7%-26.0%, respectively; P < .001 for both). The 2D global left ventricular longitudinal strain was reduced in both groups of participants (moderate COVID-19 group, -12.5% [interquartile range, -15.5% to -10.7%]; severe COVID-19 group, -12.5% [interquartile range, -15.4% to -8.7%]) compared with the healthy control group (-15.4% [interquartile range, -17.6% to -14.6%]) (P = .002 and P = .001, respectively). Conclusion Cardiac MRI myocardial tissue and strain imaging parameters suggest that a proportion of participants who had recovered from COVID-19 had subclinical myocardial abnormalities detectable months after recovery. © RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.","Li, Xiaohu; Wang, Haitao; Zhao, Ren; Wang, Tingting; Zhu, Yinsu; Qian, Yinfeng; Liu, Bin; Yu, Yongqiang; Han, Yuchi",Radiology,,223

METHODS: Single center, consecutive case series with historical controls. Patients presenting with primary RRD during the first Austrian SARS-CoV-2 lockdown (March 16th-May 3rd 2020) and a corresponding control group consisting of the same time period of the preceding 3 years. RESULTS: The mean number of patients with RD in the reference group (RG) was 22 (± 1) and in the lockdown group (LG) 15. Median total delay, defined as onset of symptoms until surgery, in the RG was 5 (lower quartile: 3.0; upper quartile: 8.0) compared to 7 (3.0; 12.0) days in the LG, (p = 0.740). During the lockdown 67% of patients were referred from an external ophthalmologist compared to 52% in the RG, (p = 0.395). 34% of patients in the RG presented with an attached macula compared to 33% in the LG (p = 0.597). PVR was present in 49% of cases in the RG compared to 73% in the LG. Single surgery success (SSS) rates were lower in the LG (73.3%) compared to the RG (85.3%), (p = 0.275). CONCLUSION: Patients with RRD during the SARS-CoV-2 lockdown presented and were treated within acceptable time limits, showed the same macula-on ratios but a higher PVR rate and a tendency towards worse SSS rates compared to the time period of the preceding 3 years.","Schranz, Markus; Georgopoulos, Michael; Sacu, Stefan; Reumueller, Adrian; Reiter, Gregor S; Mylonas, Georgios; Schmidt-Erfurth, Ursula; Pollreisz, Andreas",PLoS One,,223

501958,CompRes: A Dataset for Narrative Structure in News,2020-07-09,"BACKGROUND: The clinical characteristics and treatment of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 after recovery remained elusive. Effective antiviral therapy is important for tackling these patients. We assessed the efficacy and safety of favipiravir for treating these patients. METHODS: This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial in SARS-CoV-2 RNA re-positive patients. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either favipiravir, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary outcome was time to achieve a consecutive twice (at intervals of more than 24 h) negative RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab and sputum sample. RESULTS: Between March 27 and May 9, 2020, 55 patients underwent randomization; 36 were assigned to the favipiravir group and 19 were assigned to the control group. Favipiravir group had a significantly shorter time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab and sputum than control group (median 17 vs. 26 days); hazard ratio 2.1 (95% CI [1.1-4.0], p = 0.038). The proportion of virus shedding in favipiravir group was higher than control group (80.6% [29/36] vs. 52.6% [10/19], p = 0.030, respectively). C-reactive protein decreased significantly after treatment in the favipiravir group (p = 0.016). The adverse events were generally mild and self-limiting. CONCLUSION: Favipiravir was safe and superior to control in shortening the duration of viral shedding in SARS-CoV-2 RNA recurrent positive after discharge. However, a larger scale and randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is required to confirm our conclusion.","Zhao, Hong; Zhang, Chi; Zhu, Qi; Chen, Xianxiang; Chen, Guilin; Sun, Wenjin; Xiao, Zuohan; Du, Weijun; Yao, Jing; Li, Guojun; Ji, Yanhua; Li, Niuniu; Jiang, Yujin; Wang, Ying; Zeng, Qingjin; Li, Wei; Gong, Beilei; Chang, Xianyou; Zhu, Feng; Jiang, Xiufeng; Li, Jiawen; Wu, Zhao; Liu, Yingxia; Peng, Peng; Wang, Guiqiang",Int Immunopharmacol,,223
502090,The novel coronavirus - Should we be worried?,2020,"The rapid global spread and human health impacts of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, show humanity's vulnerability to zoonotic disease pandemics. Although anthropogenic land use change is known to be the major driver of zoonotic pathogen spillover from wildlife to human populations, the scientific underpinnings of land use-induced zoonotic spillover have rarely been investigated from the landscape perspective. We call for interdisciplinary collaborations to advance knowledge on land use implications for zoonotic disease emergence with a view toward informing the decisions needed to protect human health. In particular, we urge a mechanistic focus on the zoonotic pathogen infect-shed-spill-spread cascade to enable protection of landscape immunity-the ecological conditions that reduce the risk of pathogen spillover from reservoir hosts-as a conservation and biosecurity priority. Results are urgently needed to formulate an integrated, holistic set of science-based policy and management measures that effectively and cost-efficiently minimise zoonotic disease risk. We consider opportunities to better institute the necessary scientific collaboration, address primary technical challenges, and advance policy and management issues that warrant particular attention to effectively address health security from local to global scales.","Plowright, Raina K; Reaser, Jamie K; Locke, Harvey; Woodley, Stephen J; Patz, Jonathan A; Becker, Daniel J; Oppler, Gabriel; Hudson, Peter J; Tabor, Gary M",Lancet Planet Health,,223
502952,Impact of presymptomatic transmission on epidemic spreading in contact networks: A dynamic message-passing analysis,2021,"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 is a multisystem illness that has considerable long-term physical, psychological, cognitive, social and vocational sequelae in survivors. Given the scale of this burden and lockdown measures in most countries, there is a need for an integrated rehabilitation pathway using a tele-medicine approach to screen and manage these sequelae in a systematic and efficient way. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team of professionals in the UK developed a comprehensive pragmatic telephone screening tool, the COVID-19 Yorkshire Rehabilitation Screen (C19-YRS), and an integrated rehabilitation pathway, which spans the acute hospital trust, community trust and primary care service within the National Health Service (NHS) service model. RESULTS: The C19-YRS telephone screening tool, developed previously, was used to screen symptoms and grade their severity. Referral criteria thresholds were applied to the output of C19-YRS to inform the decision-making process in the rehabilitation pathway. A dedicated multidisciplinary COVID-19 rehabilitation team is the core troubleshooting forum for managing complex cases with needs spanning multiple domains of the health condition. CONCLUSION: The authors recommend that health services dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic adopt a comprehensive telephone screening system and an integrated rehabilitation pathway to manage the large number of survivors in a timely and effective manner and to enable the provision of targeted interventions.","Sivan, Manoj; Halpin, Stephen; Hollingworth, Lisa; Snook, Nicola; Hickman, Katherine; Clifton, Ian J",J Rehabil Med,,223

Other comorbidities do not seem to confer the same risk, therefore the understanding of the relationship between infection and cardiovascular system could be a crucial point for the fight against the virus. A great interest is directed towards the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE 2) which is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and creates important connections between the virus replication pathway, the cardiovascular system and blood pressure. All cardiovascular conditions share an imbalance of the renin angiotensin system in which ACE 2 plays a central role. In the early pandemic period, much confusion has appeared about the management of therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers especially in infected patients and in those at risk of critical illness in case of infection.

Scientific literature points to vaccine hesitancy as being a major health concern. During time of pandemics, increased consciousness of health behaviors may be encountered. The current study aimed to assess attitudes to general vaccines and to COVID-19 vaccines in particular among adult (>18) Israeli general public, and among Israeli dentists and dental hygienists. Cross-sectional surveys were filled out by a total of 501 participants (361 Israeli adults >18 years, 73 dental hygienists, and 67 dentists). Along with basic demographics, participants responded to the Hebrew VAX, COVID-VAX and HCS scales. Group comparisons were analyzed using t tests and ANOVAs with Scheffe's test used for post hoc comparisons. Dental hygienists demonstrated significantly higher anti-vaccinations approaches than both dentists (p < 0.01) and the general public (p < 0.05). In all groups, attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines were more negative compared to attitudes towards general vaccines, with hygienists demonstrating significant negative attitudes compared to dentists (p < 0.05). The general public (p = 0.56) and hygienists demonstrated increased health awareness compared to dentists (p < 0.05). As health awareness has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic primary strategies to combat vaccine hesitancy should be implemented in the general public, and in particular, an dental teams.","Shacham, Maayan; Greenblatt-Kimron, Lee; Hamama-Raz, Yaira; Martin, Leslie R; Peleg, Oren; Ben-Ezra, Menachem; Mijiritsky, Eitan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,223
510749,UAS (drone) in Response to Coronavirus,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if playing music would affect novice surgical trainees' ability to perform a complex surgical task. BACKGROUND: The effect of music in the operating room (OR) is controversial. Some studies from the anesthesiology literature suggest that OR music is distracting and should be banned. Other nonblinded studies have indicated that music improves surgeons' efficiency with simple tasks. DESIGN/METHODS: A prospective, blinded, randomized trial of 19 novice surgical trainees was conducted using an in vitro model. Each trainee performed a baseline vascular anastomosis (VA) without music. Subsequently, they performed one VA with music (song validated to reduce anxiety) and one without, in random order and without prior knowledge of the study's purpose. The primary endpoint was a difference in differences from baseline with and without music with respect to time to completion, acceleration/deceleration (using a previously validated hand-tracking motion device), and video performance scoring (3 blinded experts using a validated scale). The participants completed a poststudy survey to gauge their opinions regarding music during tasks. RESULTS: Overall, 57 VAs by 19 trainees were evaluated. Average time to completion was 11.6 minutes. When compared to baseline, time to completion improved for both the music group (pâ¯=â¯0.01) and no-music group (pâ¯=â¯0.001). When comparing music to no music, there was no difference in time to completion (pâ¯=â¯0.7), acceleration/deceleration (pâ¯=â¯0.3), or video performance scorings (pâ¯=â¯NS). Among participants, 89% responded that they enjoy listening to music while performing tasks.

511243,"Viral Science: Masks, Speed Bumps, and Guard Rails",2020,"The earned income tax credit (EITC) is the largest U.S. poverty alleviation program for families with children, and state EITC policies provide a modest supplement to the federal program. Yet there are few studies of the effects of state EITC policies on population health. We examined whether state EITC policies affect mental health and health behaviors. Participants were drawn from the 1995-2015 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a diverse national cohort study (N = 10,567). We used a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences analysis to examine the effects of state EITC programs among eligible individuals, accounting for secular trends among similar individuals in non-EITC states. Outcomes included self-reported general health, psychological distress, alcohol use, and smoking. The mean size of state EITC refunds in our sample was $265 for eligible individuals. In the overall sample, state EITC programs were not associated with any health outcomes of interest. This finding was robust to alternative specifications, and similar in subgroup analyses by gender and marital status. This study suggests that state EITC programs, which tend to provide smaller refunds than the federal program, may not be large enough to have a positive impact on mental health and health behaviors. These findings may inform policymaking related to the generosity of state EITC programs, especially as states seek to address the socioeconomic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Collin, Daniel F; Shields-Zeeman, Laura S; Batra, Akansha; White, Justin S; Tong, Michelle; Hamad, Rita",Soc Sci Med,,223
511328,Parameter Estimation and Prediction of COVID-19 Epidemic Turning Point and Ending Time of a Case Study on SIR/SQAIR Epidemic Models,2020,"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to quantify and compare the decline in volumes of cardiovascular procedures between the United States and non-US institutions during the early phase of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the care of many non-COVID-19 illnesses. Reductions in diagnostic cardiovascular testing around the world have led to concerns over the implications of reduced testing for cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Data were submitted to the INCAPS-COVID (International Atomic Energy Agency Non-Invasive Cardiology Protocols Study of COVID-19), a multinational registry comprising 909 institutions in 108 countries (including 155 facilities in 40 U.S. states), assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on volumes of diagnostic cardiovascular procedures. Data were obtained for April 2020 and compared with volumes of baseline procedures from March 2019. We compared laboratory characteristics, practices, and procedure volumes between U.S. and non-U.S. facilities and between U.S. geographic regions and identified factors associated with volume reduction in the United States. RESULTS: Reductions in the volumes of procedures in the United States were similar to those in non-U.S. facilities (68% vs. 63%, respectively; p = 0.237), although U.S. facilities reported greater reductions in invasive coronary angiography (69% vs. 53%, respectively; p < 0.001). Significantly more U.S. facilities reported increased use of telehealth and patient screening measures than non-U.S. facilities, such as temperature checks, symptom screenings, and COVID-19 testing. Reductions in volumes of procedures differed between U.S. regions, with larger declines observed in the Northeast (76%) and Midwest (74%) than in the South (62%) and West (44%). Prevalence of COVID-19, staff redeployments, outpatient centers, and urban centers were associated with greater reductions in volume in U.S. facilities in a multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We observed marked reductions in U.S. cardiovascular testing in the early phase of the pandemic and significant variability between U.S. regions. The association between reductions of volumes and COVID-19 prevalence in the United States highlighted the need for proactive efforts to maintain access to cardiovascular testing in areas most affected by outbreaks of COVID-19 infection.","Hirschfeld, Cole B; Shaw, Leslee J; Williams, Michelle C; Lahey, Ryan; Villines, Todd C; Dorbala, Sharmila; Choi, Andrew D; Shah, Nishant R; Bluemke, David A; Berman, Daniel S; Blankstein, Ron; Ferencik, Maros; Narula, Jagat; Winchester, David; Malkovskiy, Eli; Goebel, Benjamin; Randazzo, Michael J; Lopez-Mattei, Juan; Parwani, Purvi; Vitola, Joao V; Cerci, Rodrigo J; Better, Nathan; Raggi, Paolo; Lu, Bin; Sergienko, Vladimir; Sinitsyn, Valentin; Kudo, Takashi; Nørgaard, Bjarne Linde; Maurovich-Horvat, Pál; Cohen, Yosef A; Pascual, Thomas N B; Pynda, Yaroslav; Dondi, Maurizio; Paez, Diana; Einstein, Andrew J",JACC cardiovasc imaging (Print),,223

However, it is still unclear whether expression levels of these factors could reflect disease severity. Here, a case-control study was conducted with 213 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals where cases were defined as COVID-19 patients with respiratory distress requiring oxygen support (N = 38) and controls were those with mild to moderate symptoms of the disease who did not need oxygen therapy along the entire clinical course (N = 175). ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels were evaluated in nasopharyngeal swab samples by RT-qPCR and logistic regression analyzes were applied to estimate associations with respiratory outcomes. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 levels positively correlated with age, which was also strongly associated with respiratory distress. Increased nasopharyngeal ACE2 levels showed a protective effect against this outcome (adjOR = 0.30; 95% CI 0.09-0.91), while TMPRSS2/ACE2 ratio was associated with risk (adjOR = 4.28; 95% CI 1.36-13.48). On stepwise regression, TMPRSS2/ACE2 ratio outperformed ACE2 to model COVID-19 severity. When nasopharyngeal swabs were compared to bronchoalveolar lavages in an independent cohort of COVID-19 patients under mechanical ventilation, similar expression levels of these genes were observed. These data suggest nasopharyngeal TMPRSS2/ACE2 as a promising candidate for further prediction models on COVID-19.","Rossi, Átila Duque; de Araújo, João Locke Ferreira; de Almeida, Tailah Bernardo; Ribeiro-Alves, Marcelo; de Almeida Velozo, Camila; Almeida, Jéssica Maciel de; de Carvalho Leitão, Isabela; Ferreira, Sâmila Natiane; da Silva Oliveira, Jéssica; Alves, Hugo José; Scheid, Helena Toledo; Faffe, Débora Souza; Galliez, Rafael Mello; de Ávila, Renata Eliane; Resende, Gustavo Gomes; Teixeira, Mauro Martins; da Costa Ferreira Júnior, Orlando; Castiñeiras, Terezinha Marta P P; Souza, Renan Pedra; Tanuri, Amilcar; Aguiar, Renato Santana de; Barroso, Shana Priscila Coutinho; Cardoso, Cynthia Chester",Sci Rep,,223

The number of confirmed cases, proportion of local cases, and occurrence of clustered outbreaks were used as evaluation indicators to calculate the county-level epidemic risk and were assigned different weight coefficients; the absence of cases for 3 and 7 consecutive days was used as the adjustment index. When the first chart was published on February 9, there were 1 very-high-risk, 12 high-risk, and 12 low-risk counties. Under the five-colour chart, Zhejiang began to adopt precise measures to prevent and control the epidemic and resume work and production. By February 24, the low-risk counties had expanded to 82, with no high-risk and very-high-risk counties. The epidemic situation in Zhejiang province has been effectively controlled.

514127,Approximating Euclidean by Imprecise Markov Decision Processes,2020-06-26,"BACKGROUND: The major medical and social challenge of the 21st century is COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Critical issues include the rate at which the coronavirus spreads and the effect of quarantine measures and population vaccination on this rate. Knowledge of the laws of the spread of COVID-19 will enable assessment of the effectiveness and reasonableness of the quarantine measures used, as well as determination of the necessary level of vaccination needed to overcome this crisis. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to establish the laws of the spread of COVID-19 and to use them to develop a mathematical model to predict changes in the number of active cases over time, possible human losses, and the rate of recovery of patients, to make informed decisions about the number of necessary beds in hospitals, the introduction and type of quarantine measures, and the required threshold of vaccination of the population. METHODS: This study analyzed the onset of COVID-19 spread in countries such as China, Italy, Spain, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, and Germany based on publicly available statistical data. The change in the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recovered persons over time was examined, considering the possible introduction of quarantine measures and isolation of infected people in these countries. Based on the data, the virus transmissibility and the average duration of the disease at different stages were evaluated, and a model based on the principle of recursion was developed. Its key features are the separation of active (nonisolated) infected persons into a distinct category and the prediction of their number based on the average duration of the disease in the inactive phase and the concentration of these persons in the population in the preceding days. RESULTS: Specific values for SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and COVID-19 duration were estimated for different countries. In China, the viral transmissibility was 3.12 before quarantine measures were implemented and 0.36 after these measures were lifted. For the other countries, the viral transmissibility was 2.28-2.76 initially, and it then decreased to 0.87-1.29 as a result of quarantine measures. Therefore, it can be expected that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 will be suppressed if 56%-64% of the total population becomes vaccinated or survives COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted in most countries are too weak compared to those previously used in China. Therefore, it is not expected that the spread of COVID-19 will stop and the disease will cease to exist naturally or owing to quarantine measures. Active vaccination of the population is needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Furthermore, the required specific percentage of vaccinated individuals depends on the magnitude of viral transmissibility, which can be evaluated using the proposed model and statistical data for the country of interest.","Ilyin, Sergey O",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,223

515939,Diversification Benefits from Leveraged Loans? Trends in Cross-Asset Correlations,2021,"Coronaviruses hijack human enzymes to assemble the sugar coat on their spike glycoproteins. The mechanisms by which human antibodies may recognize the antigenic viral peptide epitopes hidden by the sugar coat are unknown. Glycosylation by insect cells differs from the native form produced in human cells, but insect cell-derived influenza vaccines have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. In this study, we analyzed recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein secreted from BTI-Tn-5B1-4 insect cells, by trypsin and chymotrypsin digestion followed by mass spectrometry analysis. We acquired tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectrums for glycopeptides of all 22 predicted N-glycosylated sites. We further analyzed the surface accessibility of spike proteins according to cryogenic electron microscopy and homolog-modeled structures, and available antibodies that bind to SARS-CoV-1. All 22 N-glycosylated sites of SARS-CoV-2 are modified by high-mannose N-glycans. MS/MS fragmentation clearly established the glycopeptide identities. Electron densities of glycans cover most of the spike receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2, except YQAGSTPCNGVEGFNCYFPLQSYGFQPTNGVGYQ, similar to a region FSPDGKPCTPPALNCYWPLNDYGFYTTTGIGYQ in SARS-CoV-1. Other surface-exposed domains include those located on central helix, connecting region, heptad repeats, and N-terminal domain. Because the majority of antibody paratopes bind to the peptide portion with or without sugar modification, we propose a snake-catching model for predicted paratopes: a minimal length of peptide is first clamped by a paratope, and sugar modifications close to the peptide either strengthen or do not hinder the binding.","Zhou, Dapeng; Tian, Xiaoxu; Qi, Ruibing; Peng, Chao; Zhang, Wen",Glycobiology,,223

Seventy-five patients were randomly selected from those admitted to the critical care units (Critical care group (CG)) and seventy-five hospitalized patients who did not require critical care (Non-Critical care group (nCG)) represent the control group. One additional cohort of hospitalized patiens with COVID-19 were used to validate the score. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital critical care associated with increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (odds ratio 1.052 (1.009-1.101); p=0·0043) and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (1.968 (1.389-2.590); p<0·0001), both at the time of hospital admission.

516710,Seaweed bioactive compounds: Promising and safe inputs for the green synthesis of metal nanoparticles in the food industry,2021,"Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been distributed at massive scale in developed countries, and have been effective at preventing COVID-19. Access to vaccines is limited, however, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to insufficient supply, high costs, and cold storage requirements. New vaccines that can be produced in existing manufacturing facilities in LMICs, can be manufactured at low cost, and use widely available, proven, safe adjuvants like alum, would improve global immunity against SARS-CoV-2. One such protein subunit vaccine is produced by the Serum Institute of India Pvt. Ltd. and is currently in clinical testing. Two protein components, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and hepatitis B surface antigen virus-like particles (VLPs), are each produced in yeast, which would enable a low-cost, high-volume manufacturing process. Here, we describe the design and preclinical testing of the RBD-VLP vaccine in cynomolgus macaques. We observed titers of neutralizing antibodies (>104) above the range of protection for other licensed vaccines in non-human primates. Interestingly, addition of a second adjuvant (CpG1018) appeared to improve the cellular response while reducing the humoral response. We challenged animals with SARS-CoV-2, and observed a ~3.4 and ~2.9 log10 reduction in median viral loads in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal mucosa, respectively, compared to sham controls.

This issue is especially relevant now during the Covid-19 pandemic, where the experiences of breathlessness and dependence on related medical objects have sudden and global relevance. These objects include ambulatory oxygen, oxygen concentrators and inhalers, and non-pharmacological objects such as self-monitoring devices and self-management technologies. The authors consider this relationship between things and people using an interdisciplinary approach employing psychoanalytic theory (in particular Winnicott’s theory of object relations and object use), Science and Technology Studies (STS) and phenomenology. This collaborative approach allows them to relate patient use of health objects to ways of thinking about the body, dependency, autonomy, safety and sense-making within the context of palliative care. The authors illustrate the theoretical discussion with three reflective vignettes from therapeutic practice and conclude by suggesting further interdisciplinary research to develop the conceptual and practice-based links between psychoanalytic theory, STS and phenomenology to better understand individual embodied experiences of breathlessness. They call for palliative care-infused, psychoanalytically informed interventions that acknowledge breathless patients’ dependence on things and people, concomitant with the need for autonomy in being-towards-dying.","Binnie, Kate McGuire Coreen Havi Carel",Journal of Material Culture,,223

Because the coronavirus can transmit through droplets and aerosols, facemasks and N95 respirators that require complex certification, are urgently needed. Given the situation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that ""in settings where facemasks are not available, healthcare personnel might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for the care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort."" Although aerosols and droplets can be removed through the fibers of fabrics through a series of filtration mechanisms, their filtration performances have not been evaluated in detail. Moreover, there are a series of non-medical materials available on the market, such as household air filters, coffee filters, and different types of fabrics, which may be useful when facemasks and respirators are not available. In this study, we comprehensively evaluated the overall and size-dependent filtration performances of non-medical materials. The experiments were conducted under different face velocities to study its influence on size-dependent filtration performances. The flow resistance across these filter materials is measured as an indicator of the breathability of the materials. The results illustrate that multiple layers of household air filters are able to achieve similar filtration efficiencies compared to the N95 material without causing a significant increase in flow resistance. Considering that these air filters may shed micrometer fibers during the cutting and folding processes, it is recommended that these filters should be inserted in multiple layers of fabrics when manufacturing facemasks or respirators.","Hao, Weixing; Parasch, Andrew; Williams, Stephen; Li, Jiayu; Ma, Hongyan; Burken, Joel; Wang, Yang",Int J Hyg Environ Health,,223
519988,Inorganic all-solid-state electrochromic devices with reversible color change between yellow-green and emerald green,2020,"Changes in air transport networks over time may be induced by competition among carriers, changes in regulations on airline industry, and socioeconomic events such as terrorist attacks and epidemic outbreaks. Such network changes may reflect corporate strategies of each carrier. In the present study, we propose a framework for analyzing evolution patterns in temporal networks in discrete time from the viewpoint of recurrence. Recurrence implies that the network structure returns to one relatively close to that in the past. We applied the proposed methods to four major carriers in the US from 1987 to 2019. We found that the carriers were different in terms of speed of network evolution, strength of periodicity, and changes in these quantities across decades. We also found that the network structure of the individual carriers abruptly changes from time to time. Such a network change reflects changes in their operation at their hub airports rather than famous socioeconomic events that look closely related to airline industry. The proposed methods are expected to be useful for revealing, for example, evolution of airline alliances and responses to natural disasters or infectious diseases, as well as characterizing evolution of social, biological, and other networks over time.","Sugishita, Kashin; Masuda, Naoki",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14392v1.pdf,223

Women retrospectively reported their mental/emotional health before the pandemic, as well as depression, stress, and substance use as a result of the pandemic at both time points. Linear regression measured cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between mental health and substance use.Results: Pre-COVID-19 reports of poorer mental/emotional health (b = 0.46) were significantly (p < .05) associated with number of substances used to cope with the pandemic. Elevated stress (b = 0.35) and depressive symptoms (b = 0.27) and poorer mental/emotional health (b = 0.14) in April were also significantly related to higher numbers of substances used in May (p < .05).Conclusion: Pregnant women's psychological well-being may be a readily measured indicator substance use risk during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions addressing increased stress and depression may also mitigate the emergence of greater substance use among pregnant women .","Smith, Crystal Lederhos; Waters, Sara F; Spellacy, Danielle; Burduli, Ekaterina; Brooks, Olivia; Carty, Cara L; Ranjo, Samantha; McPherson, Sterling; Barbosa-Leiker, Celestina",J Reprod Infant Psychol,,223
520016,Thinking with Quarantine Urbanism?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Immunocompromised COVID-19 patients have prolonged infectious viral shedding for more than 20 days. A test-based approach is suggested for de-isolation of these patients. METHODS: We evaluated this strategy by comparing SARS-CoV-2 viral load (Ct values) and viral cultures at the time of hospital discharge in a series of immunocompetent (6 patients) and immunocompromised (5 solid organ transplants, 1 patient with lymphoma and one patient with hepatocellular carcinoma) COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: 3/13 (23%) patients had positive viral cultures: one patient with lymphoma at day 16 and two immunocompetent patients at day 7 and 11. Of the patients, 80% had negative viral cultures and had mean Ct value 20.5. None of the solid organ transplants recipients had positive viral cultures. CONCLUSION: The mean Ct values for negative viral cultures was 20.5 in our case series of immunocompromised patients. Unlike hematological malignancies, none of the solid organ transplants had positive viral cultures. Adopting the test-based approach for all immunocompromised patients may lead to prolonged quarantine. Large scale studies in disease specific populations are needed whether a test-based approach versus a symptom-based approach or a combination is applicable for the de-isolation of various immunocompromised patients.","Alshukairi, Abeer N; Tolah, Ahmed M; Dada, Ashraf; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A; Almagharbi, Reem S; Saeedi, Mohammed F; Al-Hamzi, Mohammed A; El-Kafrawy, Sherif A; Bahaudden, Husam A; El-Saeed, Aiman; Al-Mozaini, Maha A; Khalid, Imran; Hefni, Lama K; Hassan, Ahmed M; Alandijany, Thamir A; Bajrai, Leena H; Bayumi, Daniyah T; Albishi, Ghadeer E; Althawadi, Sahar I; Zabani, Najla A; Perlman, Stanley; Azhar, Esam I",Int. j. infect. dis,,223

We aim to develop and validate a concise prognostic nomogram for patients with minor stroke and TIA. METHODS: A total of 994 patients with minor stroke and TIA were included. They were split into a derivation (n=746) and validation (n=248) cohort. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores 3 months after onset were used to assess the prognosis as unfavourable outcome (mRS&#8805;2) or favourable outcome (mRS<2). RESULT: The final model included seven independent predictors: gender, age, baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, white blood cell and serum uric acid. The Harrell's concordance index (C-index) of the nomogram for predicting the outcome was 0.775 (95% CI 0.735 to 0.814), which was confirmed by the validation cohort (C-index=0.787 (95% CI 0.722 to 0.853)). The calibration curve showed that the nomogram-based predictions were consistent with actual observation in both derivation cohort and validation cohort. CONCLUSION: The proposed nomogram showed favourable predictive accuracy for minor stroke and TIA.

521797,$100M in Dislocated Worker grants available,2020,"BACKGROUND: The upsurge of COVID-19 has caused numerous psycho-social challenges for healthcare professionals because of its ability to spread rapidly in the community and high mortality rate. The seriousness of the disease has led many healthcare professionals plagued by stigma as well as discrimination. In this study, depressive symptomatology, levels of anxiety, and related psychosocial and occupational factors experienced by healthcare professionals in Sri Lanka during COVID -19 were investigated. METHODS: A total of 512 healthcare professionals were surveyed using an online survey. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised-10, and psychosocial and occupational factors predictive of depression and anxiety were included in the survey questionnaire. Logistic regression determined the factors associated with the presence of depressive symptoms and anxiety. RESULTS: Results showed that elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety were experienced by 53.3% and 51.3%, respectively, of the participants. No differences in the prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety were found between those who were exposed and non-exposed to COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patients. Having a fear of being infected with COVID-19 and spreading it among family members were associated with increased risk of depression. Among those exposed to COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patients, poor occupational safety (OR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.25-3.39), stigmatization (OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.29-3.72), and heavy workload (OR = 2.45, 95% CI 1.53-3.92) were associated with increased risk of elevated depressive symptoms, whilst poor self-confidence (OR = 2.53, 95% CI 1.56-4.09) and heavy workload (OR = 1.94. 95% CI 1.22-3.12) were associated with increased risk of anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Fear of being infected and distress caused by fear of spreading it among family members, stigmatization, poor self-confidence, poor occupational safety and heavy workload are vital risk factors that need to be considered in future psychological support services designed for the healthcare professionals in unprecedented outbreaks like COVID-19.","Perera, Bilesha; Wickramarachchi, Bimba; Samanmalie, Champika; Hettiarachchi, Manjula",BMC Psychol,,223

This study aimed to explore the effect of COVID-19 nationwide quarantine on accelerometer-assessed physical activity of heart failure patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the daily number of steps in 26 heart failure patients during a 6-week period that included 3 weeks immediately preceding the onset of the quarantine and the first 3 weeks of the quarantine. The daily number of steps was assessed using a wrist-worn accelerometer worn by the patients as part of an ongoing randomized controlled trial. Multilevel modelling was used to explore the effect of the quarantine on the daily step count adjusted for weather conditions. As compared with the 3 weeks before the onset of the quarantine, the step count was significantly lower during each of the first 3 weeks of the quarantine (P < 0.05). When the daily step count was averaged across the 3 weeks before and during the quarantine, the decrease amounted to 1134 (SE 189) steps per day (P < 0.001), which translated to a 16.2% decrease. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of the nationwide quarantine due to COVID-19 had a detrimental effect on the level of habitual physical activity in heart failure patients, leading to an abrupt decrease of daily step count that lasted for at least the 3-week study period. Staying active and maintaining sufficient levels of physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic are essential despite the unfavourable circumstances of quarantine.","Vetrovsky, Tomas; Frybova, Tereza; Gant, Iulian; Semerad, Miroslav; Cimler, Richard; Bunc, Vaclav; Siranec, Michal; Miklikova, Marie; Vesely, Jiri; Griva, Martin; Precek, Jan; Pelouch, Radek; Parenica, Jiri; Belohlavek, Jan",ESC Heart Fail,,223

Currently, the World Health Organization has confirmed that COVID-19 is a global infectious disease pandemic. This is the third acute infectious disease caused by coronavirus infection in this century, after sudden acute respirator syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome. The damage mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. It is possible that protein S binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors and invades alveolar epithelial cells, causing direct toxic effects and an excessive immune response. This stimulates a systemic inflammatory response, thus forming a cytokine storm, which leads to lung tissue injury. In severe cases, the disease can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Patients with severe COVID-19 have a relatively high mortality rate. Currently, there are no specific antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Most patients need to be admitted to the intensive care unit for intensive monitoring and supportive organ function treatments.

We determined the seroprevalence against SARS-CoV-2 in all health care workers (HCW) at a hospital. METHODS: Cross-sectional study (14-27/04/2020). We determined SARS-CoV-2 IgG by ELISA in all HCW including external workers of a teaching hospital in Madrid. They were classified by professional category, working area, and risk for SARS-CoV-2 exposure. RESULTS: Among 2919 HCW, 2590 (88,7%) were evaluated. The mean age was 43.8 years (SD 11.1), and 73.9% were females. Globally, 818 (31.6%) workers were IgG positive with no differences for age, sex or previous diseases. Of these, 48.5% did not report previous symptoms. Seropositivity was more frequent in high- (33.1%) and medium- (33.8%) than in low-risk areas (25.8%, p = 0.007), but not for hospitalization areas attending COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients (35.5 vs 38.3% p > 0.05). HWC with a previous SARS-CoV2 PCR-positive test were IgG seropositive in 90.8%. By multivariate logistic regression analysis seropositivity was significantly associated with being physicians (OR 2.37, CI95% 1.61–3.49), nurses (OR 1.67, CI95% 1.14–2.46), nurse assistants (OR 1.84, CI95% 1.24–2.73), HCW working at COVID-19 hospitalization areas (OR 1.71, CI95% 1.22–2.40), non-COVID-19 hospitalization areas (OR 1.88, CI95% 1.30–2.73), and at the Emergency Room (OR 1.51, CI95% 1.01–2.27).

Our study investigates factors associated with timely testing and reporting of COVID-19 during the first pandemic wave in one province of Canada. Methods We identified all persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection residing in private households across the largest province of Canada, Ontario from the date of the first confirmed case in Ontario (January 25) to July 19, 2020. Our primary outcomes consisted of: (1) specimen collection within 1 day of symptom onset (test seeking), (2) test result reported to local public health within 1 day of specimen collection (test turnaround), and (3) entry of case data into the provincial database within 1 day of reporting test results (reporting). We examined 14 covariates including eight case characteristics, and six neighborhood characteristics. In addition to descriptive measures, logistic regression models were fitted. Unadjusted models included the covariate alone, while adjusted models included age, gender, month, and region. Findings Among 27,198 COVID-19 cases from January 25 2020 to July 19 2020, 28.7% had timely test seeking, 40.2% had timely test turnaround, and 75.5% had timely reporting. Male gender had lower odds of timely test seeking (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.79 [95% CI: 0.74-0.85]) compared to females. Healthcare worker status (aOR 2.77 [95% CI: 2.52-3.05] compared to non-healthcare workers), and age [≥]80 years (aOR 1.59 [95% CI: 1.33-1.91] compared to 40-59 year olds) were associated with timely test seeking. Specimen collection on Fridays and Saturdays (aOR 0.88 [95% CI: 0.79-0.98], aOR 0.83 [95% CI: 0.74-0.92] respectively, compared to Wednesdays) had lower odds of timely test turnaround. Urban areas (aOR 1.55 [95% CI: 1.41-1.70] compared to rural areas) were associated with timely test turnaround. Urban areas (aOR 0.79 [95% CI: 0.70-0.89] compared to rural areas) were less likely to have timely reporting.

Various models have been built in previous works to study the spread characteristics and trends of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, due to the limited information and data source, the understanding of the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is still restricted. Therefore, within this paper not only daily historical time-series data of COVID-19 have been taken into account during the modeling, but also regional attributes, e.g., geographic and local factors, which may have played an important role on the confirmed COVID-19 cases in certain regions. In this regard, this study then conducts a comprehensive cross-sectional analysis and data-driven forecasting on this pandemic. The critical features, which has the significant influence on the infection rate of COVID-19, is determined by employing XGB (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) and the comparison is carried out by utilizing the RF (Random Forest) and LGB (Light Gradient Boosting) models. To forecast the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases more accurately, a Dual-Stage Attention-Based Recurrent Neural Network (DA-RNN) is applied in this paper. This model has better performance than SVR (Support Vector Regression) and the encoder-decoder network on the experimental dataset. And the model performance is evaluated in the light of three statistic metrics, i.e. MAE, RMSE and R(2).

Mass spectrometry based proteomics could be used to efficiently study pathogen-host interactions and virus-hijacked cellular signaling pathways. Moreover, direct host and viral responses upon infection could be further investigated by activity-based functional validation studies. These approaches involve drug inhibition of secretory pathway, immunofluorescence staining, dominant negative mutant of protein target, real-time PCR, small interfering siRNA-mediated knockdown, and molecular cloning studies.

598532,Food Innovation as a Means of Developing Healthier and More Sustainable Foods,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND: Disinfection of contaminated or potentially contaminated surfaces has become an integral part of the mitigation strategies for controlling coronavirus disease 2019. Whilst a broad range of disinfectants are effective in inactivating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), application of disinfectants has a low throughput in areas that receive treatments. Disinfection of large surface areas often involves the use of reactive microbiocidal materials, including ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, chlorine dioxide, and hydrogen peroxide vapor. Albeit these methods are highly effective in inactivating SARS-CoV-2, the deployment of these approaches creates unacceptable health hazards and precludes the treatment of occupied indoor spaces using existing disinfection technologies. In this study, the feasibility of using dry hydrogen peroxide (DHP) in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 on contaminated surfaces in large indoor spaces was evaluated. METHODS: Glass slides were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with DHP between 5 and 25 ppb for up to 24 hours. Residual infectious virus samples were eluted from three replicates at each time point and titrated in African green monkey VeroE6 cells. RESULTS: In comparison with the observed relatively high stability of SARS-CoV-2 on contaminated glass slides (control group), residual infectious titers of glass slides inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 were significantly reduced after receiving 120 minutes of DHP treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The accelerated decay of SARS-CoV-2 on contaminated glass slides suggests that treatment with DHP can be an effective surface disinfection method for occupied indoor spaces.","Huang, Yan-Jang S.; Bilyeu, Ashley N.; Hsu, Wei-Wen; Hettenbach, Susan M.; Willix, Joshua L.; Stewart, Savannah C.; Higgs, Stephen; Vanlandingham, Dana L.",Am J Infect Control,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655321004673?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655321004673; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2021.07.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34273464/,223
598641,Disaster Preparedness and Response for the Burn Mass Casualty Incident in the Twenty-first Century,2017-04-29,"History shows that pandemics can catalyse enormous change, fundamentally transforming the way people make sense of the world. Technologies can also be catalysts of change. While digital technologies are playing a vital role in tackling the covid-19 pandemic, the pandemic also presents a significant opportunity for digital technologies. Some experts believe the pandemic may permanently normalise the comprehensive societal use of digital technologies. This article casts a critical eye over the potential implications of this opportunity in the context of information systems (IS) research and development. We introduce and outline selected principles of Zygmunt Bauman’s theory of liquid modernity. We then apply the liquid-modern principles to illustrative examples drawn from the covid-19 literature by focussing on three areas of established information systems interest: control, big data and information privacy. We show that traditional conceptualisations of scientific and societal order and control need to be reassessed; that big data alone cannot order clear and safe paths out of the current crisis and that information privacy regulations are irrelevant when undermined or circumvented by public and private actors. We conclude by making four recommendations for IS pandemic researchers and five practical recommendations in the context of the pandemic.","Doyle, Ronan; Conboy, Kieran",Int J Inf Manage,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401220310276; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0268401220310276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836641/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102184,223
598855,Fever Screening at Airports and Imported Dengue,2005-03-11,"BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal specimens (NPS) are commonly used for SARS-CoV-2 testing but can be uncomfortable for patients. Self-collected saliva or anterior nasal specimens (ANS) for SARS-CoV-2 detection are less invasive but the sensitivity of these specimen types has not been thoroughly evaluated. METHODS: During September–November 2020, 730 adults undergoing SARS-CoV-2 testing at community testing events and homeless shelters in Denver provided self-collected saliva and ANS specimens before NPS collection and answered a short survey about symptoms and specimen preference. Specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR; viral culture was performed on a subset of specimens positive by rRT-PCR. Sensitivity of saliva and ANS for SARS-CoV-2 detection by rRT-PCR was measured against NPS. Subgroup analyses included test outcomes by symptom status and culture results. RESULTS: Sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection by rRT-PCR appeared higher for saliva than for ANS (85% vs. 80%) and among symptomatic participants than among those without symptoms (94% vs. 29% for saliva; 87% vs. 50% for ANS). Among participants with culture-positive SARS-CoV-2 by any specimen type, sensitivity of saliva and ANS by rRT-PCR was 94% and 100%, respectively. Saliva and ANS were equally preferred by participants; most would undergo NPS again despite being least preferred. CONCLUSIONS: Saliva was slightly more sensitive than ANS for SARS-CoV-2 detection by rRT-PCR. Both saliva and ANS reliably detected SARS-CoV-2 among participants with symptoms. Self-collected saliva and ANS offer practical advantages, are preferred by patients, and might be most useful for testing people with COVID-19 symptoms.","Marx, Grace E; Biggerstaff, Brad J; Nawrocki, Courtney C; Totten, Sarah E; Travanty, Emily A; Burakoff, Alexis W; Scott, Tracy; De Hey, Jesse Chavez-Van; Carlson, Jesse J; Wendel, Karen A; Harcourt, Jennifer L; Tamin, Azaibi; Thomas, Jennifer D; Rowan, Sarah E",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33912930/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab330,223

A better understanding of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is key to unveil the differences in disease severity and to develop future vaccines targeting novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. Feature barcode technology combined with CITE-seq antibodies and DNA-barcoded peptide-MHC I Dextramer reagents enabled us to identify relevant SARS-CoV-2-derived epitopes and compare epitope-specific CD8+ T cell populations between mild and severe COVID-19. We identified a strong CD8+ T cell response against an S protein-derived epitope. CD8+ effector cells in severe COVID-19 displayed hyperactivation, T cell exhaustion and were missing characteristics of long-lived memory T cells. We identify A*0101 WTAGAAAYY as an immunogenic CD8+ T cell epitope with the ability to drive clonal expansion.

Despite reports of poor nutrition/intake, vitamin D status among patients on maintenance hemodialysis receiving welfare remains unknown. This study investigated the vitamin D status in welfare recipients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. METHODS: This cross-sectional study investigated vitamin D status among 106 outpatients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis at two medical facilities in Japan. Patients were divided into welfare and non-welfare groups based on their status as of September 2018. Patients were divided into two categories: serum vitamin D deficiency, defined as serum 25(OH)D concentrations < 12 ng/mL, or non-deficiency. Vitamin D deficiency was used as a dependent variable, while welfare receipt was used as the main predictor variable. RESULTS: Mean [± standard deviation] patient age, median [interquartile range] body mass index, and hemodialysis duration were 66.9 [± 10.8] years, 21.5 [19.6, 24.3] kg/m(2), and 7.9 [2.9, 12.3] years, respectively. Among 106 patients, 45 were women (42.5%) and 16 (15.1%) were receiving welfare. The welfare group had a higher diabetes prevalence (P = 0.003) and significantly lower median serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (11.5 [8.7, 14.0] vs. 14.8 [11.2, 19.9] ng/mL, P = 0.005). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that welfare receipt was a significant risk factor for vitamin D deficiency (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 4.41 [1.08, 18.07]). CONCLUSIONS: Welfare recipients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis are at significantly increased risks of vitamin D deficiency compared with patients not receiving welfare.","Yoshida, Keisuke; Yonaha, Tomoki; Yamanouchi, Masayuki; Sumi, Hirofumi; Taki, Yasuhiro; Otobe, Yuhei; Miyashita, Minoru; Hachisuka, Rina; Han, Wei; Shibagaki, Yugo; Tominaga, Naoto",Ren Replace Ther,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41100-021-00364-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34466274/,223

Many experts worldwide predict it to happen in India between end of May and end of July. Objectives: The aim of this research was to find an answer that whether India would come across the looming conditions of SARS-COVID-19 in coming days given the prevailing circumstances so far. Methods: The proposed approach used fundamental concept of Statistics by fixing the standard reference to the number of daily new tests conducted by a country. We thus computed the percentage of daily new cases and daily new deaths, in using such references. The trends were studied using simple line chart. The theory of three sigma was also used to build the upper bound for daily new cases and deaths, specifically for India to see the extreme conditions. Results: The analysis was done using data from January to till May 18, 2020 for India, Italy, USA and UK. The trend of India was almost fix between ~2% to ~6% till May 18, 2020. On contrary, Italy, USA and UK were touched the Peak on March 29, 2020 (24.38%), April 26, 2020 (23.51%) and April 24, 2020 (24.91%), respectively and declining since then. Similar trends were also noted in daily new deaths, except Italy. Conclusions: The proposed new concept for fixing universal reference provides a consistent and coherent results. It is thus clear from observed data so far that India is not going to encounter the frightened conditions or peak, like, Italy, USA, and UK for pandemic SARS-COVID-19, given the existing conditions, excluding the current migration.","Gupta, P.

METHODS: Quercetin microparticles were prepared by o/w emulsification via a phase inversion technique, using tristearin as the lipid component and phosphatidylcholine as an emulsifier. The quercetin SLMs were characterised for morphology, drug loading (15.5% ± 0.6, which corresponded to an encapsulation efficiency of 71.4%), particle size distribution, response to humidity, crystallinity, thermal behaviour and in vitro respirable fraction. Furthermore, the toxicity and the in vitro transport of the SLMs on an air liquid interface model of the Calu-3 cell line were also investigated using a modified twin-stage impinger apparatus. RESULTS: Results showed that quercetin SLMs could be formulated as dry powder suitable for inhalation drug delivery (20.5 ± 3.3% fine particle fraction ⩽4.46 μm) that was absorbed, via a linear kinetic model across the Calu-3 monolayer (22.32 ± 1.51% over 4 h). In addition, quercetin SLMs were shown to be non-toxic at the concentrations investigated. Interestingly, no apical to basolateral transport of the micronised quercetin was observed over the period of study. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest quercetin diffusion was enhanced by the presence of the lipid/emulsifying excipients in the SLMs; however further studies are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanisms.","Scalia, Santo; Haghi, Mehra; Losi, Vanessa; Trotta, Valentina; Young, Paul M.; Traini, Daniela",Eur J Pharm Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928098713001140; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejps.2013.03.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23541500/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0928098713001140,223

The dynamic data indicate that the pandemic by CoV-19 so far has infected 2,403,963 individuals, and among these 624,698 have recovered while, it has been fatal for 165,229. Without much experience, currently, the medicines that are clinically being evaluated for COVID-19 include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab, lopinavir, ritonavir, tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Therefore, countries such as Italy, USA, Spain and France with the most advanced health care system are partially successful to control CoV-19 infection. India being the 2nd largest populous country, where, the healthcare system is underdeveloped, major portion of population follow unhygienic lifestyle, is able to restrict the rate of both infection and death of its citizens from COVID-19. India has followed an early and a very strict social distancing by lockdown and has issued advisory to clean hands regularly by soap and/or by alcohol based sterilizers. Rolling data on the global index of the CoV infection is 13,306, and the index of some countries such as USA (66,148), Italy (175,055), Spain (210,126), France (83,363) and Switzerland (262,122) is high. The index of India has remained very low (161) so far, mainly due to early implementation of social lockdown, social distancing, and sanitizing hands. However, articles on social lockdown as a preventive measure against COVID-19 in PubMed are scanty. It has been observed that social lockdown has also drastic impacts on the environment especially on reduction of NO2 and CO2 emission. Slow infection rate under strict social distancing will offer time to researchers to come up with exact medicines/vaccines against CoV-19. Therefore, it is concluded that stringent social distancing via lockdown is highly important to control COVID-19 and also to contribute for self-regeneration of nature.","Paital, Biswaranjan; Das, Kabita; Parida, Sarat Kumar",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720324311?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32339832/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720324311,223

This study aimed to explore registered nurses’ competence in nursing care and their intention to stay in their current workplace. In this study, participants who had graduated from different nursing education systems were recruited. The results indicated that nurses’ level of commitment to the workplace and clinical stress were positively correlated with the experience of working with patients. Stepwise regression analysis revealed the following significant predictors for intention to stay: clinical stress, frequency of caring for people with infections, and taking a course on infectious nursing. The novice nurses’ competencies in the areas of pandemic disease care and care for infectious adults depended on the experience of nursing care and nursing competence in their professional careers, which may have impact on the nurses’ intention to stay. Therefore, clinical stress, frequency of caring for patients, and taking nursing courses were correlated with novice nurses’ intention to stay in their professional careers.","Chen, Hsiao-Mei; Liu, Chien-Chi; Yang, Shang-Yu; Wang, Yu-Rung; Hsieh, Pei-Lun",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33671613/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18042122,223

METHODS: This prospective study included 13 episodes from 9 NMD patients hospitalized for bacterial LRTI. Sputum samples were collected from these patients during the three consecutive days after their admission. Bacterial cell counts and the proportion of the most predominant bacterium identified by a clone library analysis of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence in the samples obtained before antimicrobial therapy were serially investigated. RESULTS: All episodes were initially treated with ampicillin/sulbactam. In 12 episodes with a therapeutic effect, the bacterial cell counts in the samples obtained on the third day of therapy were significantly lower than those before therapy (P = 0.0013). In most of these episodes, the most predominant bacterium in the sample obtained before therapy was undetectable by the third day of therapy. In the one patient without a therapeutic effect, neither the bacterial cell counts nor the proportion of the most predominant bacterium in the sample obtained before therapy decrease after therapy. CONCLUSION: Short-term antimicrobial therapy is sufficiently effective for LRTI in NMD patients if the initial therapy is effective.","Kawamura, Masaru; Hoshina, Takayuki; Ogawa, Masato; Yamamoto, Noboru; Haro, Kaoru; Kumadaki, Tokiko; Fukuda, Kazumasa; Kusuhara, Koichi",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220307517?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.09.035; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220307517; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32950736/,223

Bringing together these student communities during the COVID-19 pandemic may require strong interventions to control transmission. Prior modelling analyses of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within universities using compartmental modelling approaches suggest that outbreaks are almost inevitable. We constructed a network-based model to capture the interactions of a student population in different settings (housing, social and study). For a single academic term of a representative campus-based university, we ran a susceptible–latent–infectious–recovered type epidemic process, parameterised according to available estimates for SARS-CoV-2. We investigated the impact of: adherence to (or effectiveness of) isolation and test and trace measures; room isolation of symptomatic students; and supplementary mass testing. With all adhering to test, trace and isolation measures, we found that 22% (7%–41%) of the student population could be infected during the autumn term, compared to 69% (56%–76%) when assuming zero adherence to such measures. Irrespective of the adherence to isolation measures, on average a higher proportion of students resident on-campus became infected compared to students resident off-campus. Room isolation generated minimal benefits. Regular mass testing, together with high adherence to isolation and test and trace measures, could substantially reduce the proportion infected during the term compared to having no testing. Our findings suggest SARS-CoV-2 may readily transmit in a university setting if there is limited adherence to nonpharmaceutical interventions and/or there are delays in receiving test results. Following isolation guidance and effective contact tracing curbed transmission and reduced the expected time an adhering student would spend in isolation.","Hill, Edward M.; Atkins, Benjamin D.; Keeling, Matt J.; Tildesley, Michael J.; Dyson, Louise",Epidemics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2021.100476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34224948/,223

Common radiological manifestations of COVID-19 include peripheral based ground-glass or consolidative opacities; however, pneumothorax and pneumo-mediastinum are very rare manifestations; even more so within patients not on mechanical ventilation. We present a case series of 5 patients with COVID-19 who either presented with or developed spontaneous pneumothorax or pneumo-mediastinum within the course of hospitalization. With the exception of one patient, all other patients developed pneumothorax as a late manifestation in their illness; more than 10 days after initial symptom onset in COVID-19. From within this case series, all patients who developed spontaneous pneumothorax or pneumo-mediastinum during hospitalization subsequently succumbed to the illness. Spontaneous pneumothorax or pneumo-mediastinum may be an important late manifestation in COVID-19; even in spontaneously breathing patients. This may be related to development of cystic changes within the lung parenchyma. Although the clinical relevance of this finding is unknown; in our series, it portended a worse prognosis in the majority of patients.","Reyes, Stephan; Roche, Brad; Kazzaz, Farah; Ocasionez, Daniel; Lal, Aditya P.; Estrada -Y- Martin, Rosa M.; Cherian, Sujith V",Am J Med Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002962920305127?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002962920305127,223

Few previous studies have investigated this topic from a multi-disciplinary perspective, including accounting, business and management, decision sciences and health professions. METHODS: The structured literature review with its reliable and replicable research protocol allowed the researchers to extract 288 peer-reviewed papers from Scopus. The authors used qualitative and quantitative variables to analyse authors, journals, keywords, and collaboration networks among researchers. Additionally, the paper benefited from the Bibliometrix R software package. RESULTS: The investigation showed that the literature in this field is emerging. It focuses on health services management, predictive medicine, patient data and diagnostics, and clinical decision-making. The United States, China, and the United Kingdom contributed the highest number of studies. Keyword analysis revealed that AI can support physicians in making a diagnosis, predicting the spread of diseases and customising treatment paths. CONCLUSIONS: The literature reveals several AI applications for health services and a stream of research that has not fully been covered.

Databases including PubMed/MEDLINE and pre-print services (medRχiv and bioRχiv) were searched from inception up to August 24, 2020. FINDINGS: Forty-nine studies, including 127,480 HCWs met the inclusion criteria. The estimated overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs was 8.7% (95% CI: 6.7-10.9%). Seroprevalence was higher in studies that were conducted in North America (12.7%) compared to those in Europe (8.5%), Africa (8.2), and Asia (4%). Meta-regression showed that increased sensitivity of antibodies test was associated with increased seroprevalence. The following factors were associated with seropositivity: male gender, Black, Asian, and Hispanic HCWs, work in a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) unit, patient-related work, frontline health care workers, health care assistants, personal protective equipment shortage, self-reported belief for previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, previous positive polymerase chain reaction test, and household contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs is high. Excellent adherence to infection prevention and control measures, sufficient and adequate personal protective equipment, and early recognition, identification and isolation of HCWs that are infected with SARS-CoV-2 are imperative to decrease the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Galanis, Petros; Vraka, Irene; Fragkou, Despoina; Bilali, Angeliki; Kaitelidou, Daphne",J Hosp Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33212126/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120305223?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670120305223; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.11.008,223

Evolution of new virus variants is discussed. The global expansion of the delta variant demonstrates that new variants with a higher transmission potential and also being more pathogenic can easily arise. So far, the roll out of vaccines has been the most efficient tool to control the pandemic. With the evolution of new variants vaccine efficacy must be closely monitored. The zoonotic nature of the virus means that it can cross from humans into an animal reservoir and back again, and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 virus in animals in close contact to humans are needed. There will most certainly be a new wave in the coming year and it is possible that a booster vaccination is needed. To increase population immunity and reduce circulation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations most probably have to be expanded to children.","Petersen, Eskild; Gökengin, Ayse Deniz; Al Balushi, Asma; Zumla, Alimuddin",Turkish journal of medical sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34284531/; https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-2106-236,223
608548,An Intelligent and Energy-Efficient Wireless Body Area Network to Control Coronavirus Outbreak,2021-02-26,"Previous studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV reported the detection of viral RNA in the stool of both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. These clinical observations suggest that municipal and hospital wastewater from affected communities may contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Recent studies have also reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human feces. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising approach to understand the prevalence of viruses in a given catchment population, as wastewater contains viruses from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The current study reports the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in untreated wastewater in Slovenia. Two sizes of centrifugal filters were tested: 30 kDa and 10 kDA AMICON® Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filters, where 10 kDA resulted in a higher concentration factor and higher recovery efficiency. The results in hospital wastewater show that WBE can be used for monitoring COVID -19 and could be applied in municipal wastewater treatment plants as a potential complementary tool for public health monitoring at population level.","Gonçalves, José; Koritnik, Tom; Mioč, Verica; Trkov, Marija; Bolješič, Maja; Berginc, Nataša; Prosenc, Katarina; Kotar, Tadeja; Paragi, Metka",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143226; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720367577; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33176933/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720367577?v=s5,223

These measures impacted all students, as schools, educators, and families grappled with the realities of transitioning to distance-learning platforms. The research on distance learning is still in its early phases. However, almost no research exists on educating students with severe disabilities and high behavioral needs using this technology. Study 1 collected survey data from students’ families and their educators on the feasibility and effectiveness of distance-learning programs when working with students with severe developmental disabilities and high behavioral needs. Results indicated that parents and educators had generally neutral attitudes toward distance learning, although educators agreed that their students were obtaining educational benefits during distance learning. Study 2 further examined the effects of a transition to distance learning on students’ Individualized Education Plan (IEP) goal progress. Analyses revealed that students maintained about half of the skills addressed in their IEPs and made progress on an additional quarter of their IEP goals. Findings contribute to a much-needed literature base on distance learning and provide additional information as to the feasibility and effectiveness of distance learning with students with severe developmental disabilities and high behavioral needs. Future work is needed to determine best practices for distance learning with this population.","Tomaino, Melaura Andree Erickson; Greenberg, Alissa L.; Kagawa-Purohit, Sarah Ann; Doering, Sagui A.; Miguel, Edward Steven",Behav Anal Pract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40617-020-00549-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33680340/,223

One of the most common COVID-19 CNS complications is COVID-19 encephalopathy, a disorder characterized by cognitive impairment, altered consciousness, and even seizures. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is a recently approved mRNA-based vaccine aimed at preventing COVID-19 infections and their complications. Here, we describe two patients with no known neurological or psychiatric history who presented with encephalopathy and seizures that began after part one of their Moderna COVID-19 vaccine series. To our knowledge, there are no other reports of post-Moderna COVID-19 vaccine encephalopathy in the literature. We suggest a mechanism for this complication and thoroughly discuss why the Moderna vaccine is possibly responsible, by addressing confounders in our patients.","Liu, Benjamin D; Ugolini, Corrado; Jha, Pinky",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367780/,223

At our institution, we implemented a risk-stratified approach to incorporating telemedicine into our prenatal care. The objective of this study was to determine acceptability of virtual prenatal care and preferences for future pregnancies among our patient population. STUDY DESIGN: We sought feedback from a convenience sample of patients regarding the acceptability of virtual prenatal care and desires for future pregnancies. RESULTS: We found that virtual prenatal care is acceptable to patients, and the majority would like to incorporate it into future post-pandemic pregnancy care, although preferences differ by race. CONCLUSION: Virtual prenatal care should continue to be employed in post-pandemic obstetric practice. Obstetrical providers must determine how to incorporate this practice in a risk-stratified and equitable fashion.","Sullivan, Mackenzie W; Kanbergs, Alexa N; Burdette, Emily R; Silberman, Jason; Dolisca, Sarah; Scarry, Jill; Soffer, Marti; Kaimal, Anjali; Bryant Mantha, Allison; Bernstein, Sarah N",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34554895/; https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2021.1980534,223

METHODS: Loss of sense of smell and/or taste was reported by 26 of 63 COVID-19 patients (41%), whereas only 31% of the patients experiencing hyposmia had simultaneous symptoms of rhinitis. Smell tests were performed in 14 of these patients and taste tests in 10. The measurements were conducted in a patient care setting in an early COVID-19 cohort. RESULTS: An olfactory disorder was present in 10/14 patients, before as well as after nasal decongestion. In 2 of these patients, hyposmia was the leading or only symptom of SARS-CoV‑2 infection. All tested patients reported recovery of smell and/or taste within 8 to 23 days. CONCLUSION: The data imply that a) COVID-19 can lead to hyposmia in a relevant number of patients, the incidence was approximately 30% in this cohort; b) in most cases, the olfactory disturbance was not associated with nasal obstruction, thus indicating a possible neurogenic origin; and c) the olfactory disorder largely resolved within 1–3 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. There were no indications of an increased incidence of dysgeusia. These early data may help in the interpretation of COVID-19-associated hyposmia as well as in the counseling of patients, given the temporary nature of hyposmia observed in this study. Furthermore, according to the current experience, hyposmia without rhinitic obstruction can be the leading or even the only symptom of a SARS-CoV‑2 infection.","Bocksberger, S.; Wagner, W.; Hummel, T.; Guggemos, W.; Seilmaier, M.; Hoelscher, M.; Wendtner, C.-M.",HNO,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00106-020-00891-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32451564/,223

Nitazoxanide (NTZ) has a broad antiviral effect. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind pilot clinical trial comparing NTZ 600 mg BID versus Placebo for seven days among 50 individuals (25 each arm) with SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR+ (PCR) that were hospitalized with mild respiratory insufficiency from May 20(th), 2020, to September 21(st), 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04348409). Clinical and virologic endpoints and inflammatory biomarkers were evaluated. A five-point scale for disease severity (SSD) was used. FINDINGS: Two patients died in the NTZ arm compared to 6 in the placebo arm (p = 0.564). NTZ was superior to placebo when considering SSD (p < 0001), the mean time for hospital discharge (6.6 vs. 14 days, p = 0.021), and negative PCR at day 21 (p = 0.035), whereas the placebo group presented more adverse events (p = 0.04). Among adverse events likely related to the study drug, 14 were detected in the NTZ group and 22 in placebo (p = 0.24). Among the 30 adverse events unlikely related, 21 occurred in the placebo group (p = 0.04). A decrease from baseline was higher in the NTZ group for d-Dimer (p = 0.001), US-RCP (p < 0.002), TNF (p < 0.038), IL-6 (p < 0.001), IL-8 (p = 0.014), HLA DR. on CD4(+)T lymphocytes (p < 0.05), CD38 in CD4(+) and CD8(+)T (both p < 0.05), and CD38 and HLA-DR. on CD4+ (p < 0.01) INTERPRETATION: Compared to placebo in clinical and virologic outcomes and improvement of inflammatory outcomes, the superiority of NTZ warrants further investigation of this drug for moderate COVID-19 in larger clinical trials. A higher incidence of adverse events in the placebo arm might be attributed to COVID-19 related symptoms.","Blum, Vinicius Fontanesi; Cimerman, Sérgio; Hunter, James R; Tierno, Paulo; Lacerda, Acioly; Soeiro, Alexandre; Cardoso, Florentino; Bellei, Nancy Cristina; Maricato, Juliana; Mantovani, Nathalia; Vassao, Marcella; Dias, Danilo; Galinskas, Juliana; Janini, Luis Mário Ramos; Santos-Oliveira, Joanna Reis; Da-Cruz, Alda Maria; Diaz, Ricardo Sobhie",EClinicalMedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100981; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34222847/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589537021002613; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537021002613,223

In this letter we outline two cases of acute hypertriglyceridemia in patients with COVID‐19 treated with tocilizumab: one with elevated biomarkers consistent with acute pancreatitis the other without. Given the paucity of robust clinical trial data for most COVID‐19 pharmacotherapies at this time, clinicians should continue to remain steadfast in recognition of interventions that improve clinical outcomes and vigilant in monitoring for acute adverse effects that are difficult to detect in clinical trials with small sample sizes. The observations from our two cases highlight the complex, not fully elucidated interrelationship between elevated IL‐6 and pharmacologic interventions impacting this pathway.

Public health emergencies may generate a range of unforeseen potential stressors for vulnerable individuals and communities. The current pandemic has apparently led to an increase in psychiatric symptoms among these students. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to characterize the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among Portuguese and Swiss higher-education students. METHODS: This project will use a mixed methods sequential explanatory design in Portugal and Switzerland, with two consecutive phases. During Phase I, a quantitative study will assess the psychological responses of higher-education students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A convenience sampling method will be used for collecting information from students. The association between variables will be determined with univariable and multivariable analyses. During Phase II, qualitative data will be collected in order to understand the determinants of psychological stress and the strategies adopted by students as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to identify their opinions and feelings about the teaching-learning process during quarantine. In this phase, participants will be selected using a maximum-variation sampling method. Data from focus group discussions will be coded and inductively analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Finally, quantitative and qualitative results will be merged during interpretation to provide complementary perspectives. RESULTS: This paper describes and discusses the protocol for this mixed methods study, which will be completed in December 2021. This study was formally approved by the local ethics committee (CE/IPLEIRIA/22/2020) in Portugal and authorized by the Swiss Association of Research Ethics Committees, swissethics (CER-VD-2020-02889).

Understanding of the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is still in its infancy. A 382-nt deletion strain lacking ORF8 (Δ382 herein) was isolated in Singapore in March 2020. Infection with Δ382 was associated with less severe disease in patients, compared to infection with wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Here, we established Nasal Epithelial cells (NECs) differentiated from healthy nasal-tissue derived stem cells as a suitable model for the ex-vivo study of SARS-CoV-2 mediated pathogenesis. Infection of NECs with either SARS-CoV-2 or Δ382 resulted in virus particles released exclusively from the apical side, with similar replication kinetics. Screening of a panel of 49 cytokines for basolateral secretion from infected NECs identified CXCL10 as the only cytokine significantly induced upon infection, at comparable levels in both wild-type and Δ382 infected cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed the temporal up-regulation of distinct gene subsets during infection, with anti-viral signaling pathways only detected at late time-points (72 hours post-infection, hpi). This immune response to SARS-CoV-2 was significantly attenuated when compared to infection with an influenza strain, H3N2, which elicited an inflammatory response within 8 hpi, and a greater magnitude of anti-viral gene up-regulation at late time-points. Remarkably, Δ382 induced a host transcriptional response nearly identical to that of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 at every post-infection time-point examined. In accordance with previous results, Δ382 infected cells showed an absence of transcripts mapping to ORF8, and conserved expression of other SARS-CoV-2 genes. Our findings shed light on the airway epithelial response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and demonstrate a non-essential role for ORF8 in modulating host gene expression and cytokine production from infected cells.","Gamage, Akshamal M.; Tan, Kai Sen; Chan, Wharton O.

As a longitudinal case study, the island destination of Bali provides insight into tourism crisis vulnerability, particularly in relation to issues of unplanned development and host community over-dependence on tourism revenue. Furthermore, the experience of two separate targeted terrorist attacks on the island reveals a number of challenges and tangible lessons for stakeholders engaged in destination disaster management and crisis recovery. While the restoration of consumer confidence and arrival numbers are often considered to be indicators of successful tourism recovery, the broader disaster management literature advocates for proactive vulnerability reduction premised in sustainable development and comprehensive, integrated disaster risk reduction.","Gurtner, Yetta",Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Management,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1447677016300614; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1447677016300614,223

METHODS: All laboratory-confirmed reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction positive COVID-19 patients who had been tested at three governmental hospitals in Saudi Arabia (two in Riyadh and one in Makkah) between March 8 and May 18, 2020 were included. Demographics, COVID-19 variables, clinical characteristics and healthcare utilization variables were extracted and combined, and a descriptive analysis was conducted. Symptomatic and asymptomatic (on presentation) patients' data were compared. RESULTS: Eighty percent of the patients were males (81.4% of symptomatic and 73.2% of asymptomatic patients, P = 0.02). Moreover, 47.6% and 38.4% of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were aged 40–64 years, respectively. Fever, cough and breathing difficulties were frequent presenting symptoms. Overall, diabetes (16.4%), hypertension (11.7%), chronic respiratory disease (7.1%) were the most frequent comorbidities, with no differences between the two groups. Symptomatic patients had higher C-reactive protein levels (3.55 vs. 0.30 mg/L; P < 0.0001) and lower total lymphocytes (1.41 vs. 1.70; P = 0.02). ICU admission and mortality were 12.1% and 4.1% in symptomatic, compared to 6.0% and 2.9% in asymptomatic patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: In the studied COVID-19 cohort, symptomatic patients tended to be older, had higher C-reactive protein and more lymphopenia with worse outcome than asymptomatic patients. This granular analysis of COVID-19 cohorts enables identification of at-risk cohorts in future waves, optimizing development of patient pathways and public health interventions.","Almubark, Rasha A.; Memish, Ziad A.; Tamim, Hani; Alenazi, Thamer H.; Alabdulla, Mohammed; Sanai, Faisal M.; BinDhim, Nasser F.; Alfaraj, Sarah; Alqahtani, Saleh A.",Saudi J Med Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34084102/; https://doi.org/10.4103/sjmms.sjmms_853_20,223

620969,Disidratazione acuta nel lattante,2007-12-31,"Underreporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths is a hindrance to correctly modeling and monitoring the pandemic. This is primarily due to limited testing, lack of reporting infrastructure and a large number of asymptomatic infections. In addition, diagnostic tests (RT-PCR tests for detecting current infection) and serological antibody tests for IgG (to assess past infections) are imperfect. In particular, the diagnostic tests have a high false negative rate. Epidemiologic models with a latent compartment for unascertained infections like the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) models can provide predictions for unreported cases and deaths under certain assumptions. Typically, the number of unascertained cases is unobserved and thus we cannot validate these estimates for a real study except for simulation studies. Population-based seroprevalence studies can provide a rough estimate of the total number of infections and help us check epidemiologic model projections. In this paper, we develop a method to account for high false negative rates in RT-PCR in an extension to the classic SEIR model. We apply this method to Delhi, the national capital region of India, with a population of 19.8 million and a COVID-19 hotspot of the country, obtaining estimates of underreporting factor for cases at 34-53 times and that for deaths at 8-13 times. Based on a recently released serological survey for Delhi with an estimated 22.86% seroprevalence, we compute adjusted estimates of the true number of infections reported by the survey (after accounting for misclassification of the antibody test results) which is largely consistent with the model outputs, yielding an underreporting factor for cases from 30-42. Together with the model and the serosurvey, this implies approximately 96-98% cases in Delhi remained unreported and whereas only 109,140 cases were reported on July 10, the true number of infections varied somewhere between 4.4-4.6 million across different estimates. While repeated serological monitoring is resource intensive, model-based adjustments, run with the most up to date data, can provide a viable option to keep track of the unreported cases and deaths and gauge the true extent of transmission of this insidious virus.","Bhattacharyya, R.; Bhaduri, R.; Kundu, R.; Salvatore, M.; Mukherjee, B.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.31.20166249; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.31.20166249v1?rss=1,223

Important issues discussed in this article are new recommendations for the refeeding process and the definition of target weight as well as principles of medical stabilization and psychotherapeutic approaches. The pros and cons of longer or shorter hospitalization times are discussed, and the advantages of stepped care and day patient treatment are described. A new promising intensive treatment method involving the patient, their caregivers and the direct home environment is introduced. Parents and caregivers should be included in treatment research to foster collaborative work with the attending clinicians. There is an urgent need to evaluate the mid- to long-term outcomes of various intensive treatment programs to compare their effectiveness and costs across different health care systems.

624972,Channels’ Confirmation and Predictions’ Confirmation: From the Medical Test to the Raven Paradox,2020-03-26,"As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads, the susceptible subpopulation declines causing the rate at which new infections occur to slow down. Variation in individual susceptibility or exposure to infection exacerbates this effect. Individuals that are more susceptible or more exposed tend to be infected and removed from the susceptible subpopulation earlier. This selective depletion of susceptibles intensifies the deceleration in incidence. Eventually, susceptible numbers become low enough to prevent epidemic growth or, in other words, the herd immunity threshold is reached. Here we fit epidemiological models with inbuilt distributions of susceptibility or exposure to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks to estimate basic reproduction numbers (R_0) alongside coefficients of individual variation (CV) and the effects of containment strategies. Herd immunity thresholds are then calculated as 1-(1/R_0 )^(1/((1+CV^2 ) )) or 1-(1/R_0 )^(1/((1+2CV^2 ) )), depending on whether variation is on susceptibility or exposure. Our inferences result in herd immunity thresholds around 10-20%, considerably lower than the minimum coverage needed to interrupt transmission by random vaccination, which for R_0 higher than 2.5 is estimated above 60%. We emphasize that the classical formula, 1-1/R_0 , remains applicable to describe herd immunity thresholds for random vaccination, but not for immunity induced by infection which is naturally selective. These findings have profound consequences for the governance of the current pandemic given that some populations may be close to achieving herd immunity despite being under more or less strict social distancing measures.","Aguas, R.; Corder, R.

626619,Interplay between epidemic spread and information propagation on metapopulation networks,2017-05-07,"Seasonal influenza remains a major public health problem, responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths every year, mostly of elderly people. Despite the wide availability of vaccines, there are multiple problems decreasing the effectiveness of vaccination programs. These include viral variability and hence the requirement to match strains by estimating which will become prevalent each season, problems associated with vaccine and adjuvant production, and the route of administration as well as the perceived lower vaccine efficiency in older adults. Clinical protection is still suboptimal for all of these reasons, and vaccine uptake remains too low in most countries. Efforts to improve the effectiveness of influenza vaccines include developing universal vaccines independent of the circulating strains in any particular season and stimulating cellular as well as humoral responses, especially in the elderly. This commentary assesses progress over the last 3 years towards achieving these aims. Since the beginning of 2020, an unprecedented international academic and industrial effort to develop effective vaccines against the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has diverted attention away from influenza, but many of the lessons learned for the one will synergize with the other to mutual advantage. And, unlike the SARS-1 epidemic and, we hope, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, influenza will not be eliminated and thus efforts to improve influenza vaccines will remain of crucial importance.","Pawelec, Graham; McElhaney, Janet",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32399192/; https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.22611.1,223

The virus was first detected in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States in January, 2020, with subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks detected in all 50 states by early March. To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the U.S., we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated impacts of federal travel restrictions.

Exciting preclinical studies in experimental neonatal lung injury have provided the impetus for the initiation of early phase clinical trials in extreme preterm infants at risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Clinical translation of promising therapies, however, is slow and often fails. In the adult population, results of clinical trials so far have not matched the enticing preclinical data. The neonatal field has experienced many hard‐earned lessons with the implementation of oxygen therapy or postnatal steroids. Here we briefly summarize the preclinical data that have permitted the initiation of early phase clinical trials of cell‐based therapies in extreme preterm infants and describe the INCuBAToR concept (Innovative Neonatal Cellular Therapy for Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia: Accelerating Translation of Research), an evidence‐based approach to mitigate the risk of translating advanced therapies into this vulnerable patient population. The INCuBAToR addresses several of the shortcomings at the preclinical and the clinical stage that usually contribute to the failure of clinical translation through (a) systematic reviews of preclinical and clinical studies, (b) integrated knowledge transfer through engaging important stakeholders early on, (c) early economic evaluation to determine if a novel therapy is viable, and (d) retrospective and prospective studies to define and test ideal eligibility criteria to optimize clinical trial design. The INCuBAToR concept can be applied to any novel therapy in order to enhance the likelihood of success of clinical translation in a timely, transparent, rigorous, and evidence‐based fashion.","Thébaud, Bernard; Lalu, Manoj; Renesme, Laurent; van Katwyk, Sasha; Presseau, Justin; Thavorn, Kednapa; Cobey, Kelly D.; Hutton, Brian; Moher, David; Soll, Roger F.; Fergusson, Dean",Stem Cells Transl Med,https://doi.org/10.1002/sctm.20-0508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33570257/,223

However, studies do not sufficiently consider the age-dependency of other important factors influencing the course of disease. The aim of this review was to quantify the isolated effect of age on severe COVID-19 outcomes. We searched Pubmed to find relevant studies published in 2020. Two independent reviewers evaluated them using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. We extracted the results and assessed seven domains of bias for each study. After adjusting for important age-related risk factors, the isolated effect of age was estimated using meta-regression. Twelve studies met our inclusion criteria: four studies for COVID-19 disease severity, seven for mortality, and one for admission to ICU. The crude effect of age (5.2% and 13.4% higher risk of disease severity and death per age year, respectively) substantially decreased when adjusting for important age-dependent risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease/cerebrovascular disease, compromised immunity, previous respiratory disease, renal disease). Adjusting for all six comorbidities indicates a 2.7% risk increase for disease severity (two studies), and no additional risk of death per year of age (five studies). The indication of a rather weak influence of age on COVID-19 disease severity after adjustment for important age-dependent risk factors should be taken in consideration when implementing age-related preventative measures (e.g., age-dependent work restrictions).","Romero Starke, Karla; Petereit-Haack, Gabriela; Schubert, Melanie; Kämpf, Daniel; Schliebner, Alexandra; Hegewald, Janice; Seidler, Andreas",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32824596/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17165974,223

We present a case series including a case of severe hyponatremia and a 32-fold overdose raising safety and effectiveness concerns in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We measured LPV trough concentrations in 12 patients and reviewed their clinical charts for side effects known to occur in HIV patients. FINDINGS: Compared to established LPV trough concentrations in HIV patients, concentrations in COVID-19 patients were 3-fold greater (19.37 ± 10.12 mcg/mL versus 6.25 mcg/mL). In addition, cholestasis and dyslipidemia toxicity thresholds were exceeded in 12/12 and 11/12 patients respectively. No patients achieved the presumed therapeutic concentration. Side effects included gastrointestinal symptoms (5/12), electrolyte imbalances (4/12), liver enzyme disturbances (5/12) and triglyceride elevations (2/12). CONCLUSION: No patients reached presumed therapeutic LPV concentrations despite experiencing side effects and exceeding cholestasis and dyslipidemia toxicity thresholds.

Here, we report a genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in 48 raw wastewater samples collected from three wastewater treatment plants in Switzerland between July 9 and December 21, 2020. We find evidence for the presence of several mutations that define the B.1.1.7 and 501.V2 lineages in some of the samples, including co-occurrences of up to three B.1.1.7 signature mutations on the same amplicon in four samples from Lausanne and one sample from a Swiss ski resort dated December 9 - 21. These findings suggest that the B.1.1.7 strain could be detected by mid December, two weeks before its first verification in a patient sample from Switzerland.

Pentoxifylline was able to inhibit JEV replication in a dose-dependent manner at a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 50.3 μg/mL (0.00018 μM) and a therapeutic index (TI) of 10. Experiments to study the mechanism of antiviral action of pentoxifylline using in vitro translation of viral mRNA suggested that the drug did not interfere either with early or late protein synthesis but most likely exerted its action on virus assembly and/or release. Furthermore, the in vivo study showed that pentoxifylline at a concentration of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg body weight was able to protect completely mice challenged with 50 × 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) of JEV.","Sebastian, Liba; Desai, Anita; Madhusudana, Shampur Narayan; Ravi, Vasanthapuram",Int J Antimicrob Agents,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857908003221; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924857908003221; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2008.07.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18804347/,223

It is proposed that it could be used to display direct retrieval and the functional sequelae of COVID-19. Aim of the study: To assess the Post COVID-19 functional status in Egypt and to evaluate if age, gender, comorbidities have any effect on functional limitations in recovered COVID-19 patients. Patients and methods: A total of 444 registered confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. They were interviewed in our follow-up clinics or by calls and filled an Arabic translated PCFS scale in paper or online forms as well as their demographic and clinical data. Results: 80% of COVID-19 recovered cases have diverse degrees of functional restrictions ranging from negligible (63.1%), slight (14.4%), moderate (2%) to severe (0.5%) based on PCFS. Furthermore, there was a substantial variance between the score of PCFS with age (P= 0.003), gender (P= 0.014), the duration since the onset of the symptoms of COVID-19 (P <0.001), need for oxygen supplementation (P<0.001), need for ICU admittance (P= 0.003), previous periodic influenza vaccination (P<0.001), smoking status (P < 0.001) and lastly the presence of any comorbid disorder (P <0.001). Conclusions: Most of the COVID-19 recovered cases have diverse degrees of functional restrictions ranging from negligible to severe based on PCFS. These restrictions were affected by age, gender, periodic influenza vaccination, smoking, duration since symptoms onset, need for oxygen or ICU admittance, and lastly the presence of coexisting comorbidity.","Mohamed-Hussein, A.; Galal, I.; Saad, M.; Zayan, H.

In this paper, we combine several administrative data sources to estimate the relationship between mortality due to COVID-19 and poverty at a very local level (i.e. the municipality level) in France, one of the most severely hit country in the world. We find strong evidence of an income gradient in the impact of the pandemic on mortality: it is twice as large in the poorest municipalities compared to other municipalities. We then show that both poor housing conditions and higher occupational exposure are likely mechanisms. Overall, these mechanisms accounts for up to 60% of the difference observed between rich and poor municipalities.","Brandily, P.; Brebion, C.; Briole, S.; Khoury, L.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.09.20149955v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.09.20149955,223

Clinical data evidence its safety and efficiency for the treatment of flu and other viral infections via enhancement of interferon production. The gut-associated lymphoid tissue seems a likely site of kagocel action. The study was aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of its action using murine Peyer’s patches lymphocytes as a test system and the cytokines production and gene expression patterns as the primary outcomes. The Peyer’s patches lymphocytes isolated from BALB/c mice were stimulated with concanavalin A, or, to mimic viral infection, with a combination of concanavalin A and TLR3 ligand poly I:C. After 24 h of stimulation the cells were treated with saline, 30, 100, or 300 μg/ml of kagocel, or, as positive controls, 300 μg/ml oats b-D-glucan or 300 μg/ml lentinan. After 24 and 72 h of incubation with these drugs cytokines production was analyzed with ELISA and gene expression pattern was investigated using nCounter Inflammation panel chips followed by bioinformatics analysis. Expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response, antiviral defense, lymphocytes survival and proliferation (C1qa, C2, C3, Ccl21a, Il11, Il1b, Il23a, Il5, Ltb4r2, Alox15, Pla2g4a, Ptger1, Mapkapk5, Hras, Ifna1, Tlr2, Mrc1, Mx2) was upregulated in kagocel-treated Peyer’s patches lymphocytes.

The changes in gene expression pattern and the outcomes of bioinformatics analysis suggest that pattern recognition receptors, TLRs and dectin-1, are the key mediators of kagocel immunomodulatory action, with the possible involvement of interferon autocrine loop. The genes upregulated with kagocel include diverse components of the innate immune defense system.","Andreev-Andrievskiy, Alexander A.; Zinovkin, Roman A.; Mashkin, Mikhail A.; Frolova, Olga Yu.; Kazaishvili, Yuriy G.; Scherbakova, Victoria S.; Rudoy, Boris A.; Nesterenko, Vladimir G.",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34413772/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.679511,223

The nucleotide and amino acid sequence was most similar to the D1466 strain and was 84.8% and 89.9% identity, respectively. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarity among the DE072 strain and other IBV strains was less than 71.9% and 76.6%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis, based on both nucleotide and amino acid sequence, showed that IBV isolates were divided into two distinct groups. The DE072 strain clustered only with the D1466 strain, and all of the other strains were distinct from those two viruses. Further the nucleotide sequence analysis of the entire spike glycoprotein gene of the DE072 strain demonstrated that most of the gene contained a D1466-like sequence, and five putative cross-over sites were identified. Based on cross-over site, phylogenetic trees were constructed for different regions of the spike gene, and a difference in topology between these trees was observed. Considering the difference in S2 gene sequence identity and tree topology, we assume that DE072 and D1466 viruses share a different origin from other isolates of IBV. Furthermore, entire spike gene analysis indicates that the DE072 strain has undergone recombination event as well as extensive antigenic variation.","Lee, Chang-Won; Jackwood, Mark W.",Virus Genes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11210943/,223

We used a variety of methods to test its effects on PEDV in Vero cells. Our experiments show that EGCG can effectively inhibit PEDV infections (with HLJBY and CV777 strains) at different time points in the infection using western blot analysis. We found that EGCG inhibited PEDV infection in a dose-dependent manner 24 h after the infection commenced using western blotting, plaque formation assays, immunofluorescence assays (IFAs), and quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). We discovered that EGCG treatment of Vero cells decreased PEDV attachment and entry into them by the same method analysis. Western blotting also showed that PEDV replication was inhibited by EGCG treatment. Whereas EGCG treatment was found to inhibit PEDV assembly, it had no effect on PEDV release. In summary, EGCG acts against PEDV infection by inhibiting PEDV attachment, entry, replication, and assembly.","Huan, Changchao; Xu, Weiyin; Ni, Bo; Guo, Tingting; Pan, Haochun; Jiang, Luyao; Li, Lin; Yao, Jingting; Gao, Song",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.628526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692691/,223

Untersucht werden soll, wie diese Pandemie-Maßnahme auf die Bevölkerung eines ländlich geprägten, strukturschwachen Bundeslandes am Beispiel der Notaufnahmefallzahlen eines Schwerpunktversorgers gewirkt hat. METHODEN: Abruf von anonymisierten aggregierten Routinedaten und Auswertung der Phasen ""Vergleich"" (03.07.2019-15.03.2020), Corona-Phase 1"" (16.03.2020-06.05.2020) und ""Corona-Phase 2"" (07.05.2020-31.07.2020). ERGEBNISSE: Auswertung von 24977 Patientendaten (2493 Patienten Corona-Phase 1/5106 Patienten Phase 2). 53% der Patienten sind älter als 50 Jahre, ca. 30% älter als 70 Jahre. Regulär suchen 67,6 Patienten die Notaufnahme je Tag auf. In der Corona-Phase 1 reduziert sich die Zahl um 19,7 Patienten/Tag; in der Phase 2 sind 8,2 Patienten/Tag weniger als in der Vergleichsgruppe - bei insgesamt unveränderter Altersstruktur. 56% der Patienten suchen eigenständig (Selbstvorstellung) die Notaufnahme auf, 24% auf Veranlassung eines Vertragsarztes, 17% werden durch den Rettungsdienst (Notarzt, RTW) vorgestellt. Besonders auffällig ist der Fallzahlrückgang bei den Patienten, die sich selbst in der Notaufnahme vorstellen und vom Kassenarzt eingewiesen werden. Die Fallzahlen über den Rettungsdienst (NEF, RTW) sind relativ stabil - bzw. in der 2. Corona-Phase anteigend (Notarzt+7%, RTW+36%). Das Hauptdiagnosespektrum der aus der Notaufnahme stationär aufgenommenen Patienten umfasst bei den Vertragsarzteinweisungen und Selbstvorsteller 375 bzw. 360 ICD-10-GM Dreistellergruppen. Hierbei reduzieren sich typische Notfallerkrankungen deutlich (Hirninfarkt (I63) -52%, Herzinfarkt (I21) -61%, Cholelithiasis (K80) -75% bei Selbstvorstellungen/Vorhofflimmern (I48) -55%, akute Bronchitis (J20) - 35%, Gastroenteritis (A09) -48% bei Vertragsarzteinweisungen - jeweils Corona-Phase 1 zu Vergleichsgruppe). Diese Fallzahlverluste sind überwiegend in der Corona-Phase 2 persistent (Hirninfarkt (I63) - 29% bei Selbstvorstellern) und nur z. T. reversibel (Herzinfarkt (I21)+10%). SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: Eine Reduktion von Notfallkontakten, die nicht final durch den Pandemieverlauf erklärbar ist, v. a. der Selbstvorstellungen, Kassenarztvorstellungen fanden statt. Die Reduktion der Fallzahlen v. a. der überwiegend älteren Patienten, die selbstständig oder über den Kassenarzt vorgestellt wurden, überwog den Anteil des professionellen Rettungsdienstes deutlich. Es kann vermutet werden, dass Pandemie-Maßnahmen selbst zu diesem Effekt - trotz ausreichender medizinischer Ressourcen- geführt haben.

BACKGROUND: Extensive lockdown restrictions were implemented by the government to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic situation. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether and how access to the emergency department (ED) changed during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to baseline parameter in a hospital in the county Mecklenburg in Germany. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on patients who accessed the ED in ""Corona - Phase 1"" (16.03.2020-06.05.2020) and ""Corona - Phase 2"" (07.05.2020-31.07.2020) were collected and compared with the""pre-Covid-era"" (03.07.2019-15.03.2020). RESULTS: Data on 24,977 patients were evaluated; of these, 2493 patients in the Corona-Phase 1 and 5106 patients in the Corona-Phase 2 periods. Among these patients, 53% patients were older than 50, 30% older than 70 years. Normally 67.6 patients/day (p/d) visit the ED. This value decreased to 19.7 p/d in Phase 1 and 8.2 p/d in phase 2. 24% of the patients were referred by the GP, 56% presented themselves and 17% by the rescue service. Wo observed a decline of stroke cases by 52%, heart attacks by 61% and atrial fibrillation by 55% in Phase 1. The decline of cases mainly persisted in phase 2 (e. g. stroke 29%). CONCLUSIONS: Access to the ED decreased during the COVID-19 outbreak especially by patients who presented to the ED by themselves or referred by the GP - these were more than those brought into the ED by the rescue service. Based on literature and our own data, we suspect the lockdown restrictions could be responsible for the observed decrease of cases, too. In the context of the mild course of COVID-19 cases in Mecklenburg, these results are surprising. Further studies regarding whether and how the population used the ED should be performed.","Stöwhas, Mathias; Lippert, Hans",Gesundheitswesen,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1384-0508; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33733450/,223

The genome of HCoV-EMC is most closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV HKU4) and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 (Pi-BatCoV HKU5) we discovered in 2006. Phylogenetically, HCoV-EMC is clustered with Ty-BatCoV HKU4/Pi-BatCoV HKU5 with high bootstrap supports, indicating that HCoV-EMC is a group C betaCoV. The major difference between HCoV-EMC and Ty-BatCoV HKU4/Pi-BatCoV HKU5 is in the region between S and E, where HCoV-EMC possesses five ORFs (NS3a-NS3e) instead of four, with low (31%–62%) amino acid identities to Ty-BatCoV HKU4/Pi-BatCoV HKU5. Comparison of the seven conserved replicase domains for species demarcation shows that HCoV-EMC is a novel CoV species.

We managed to mathematically forecast the inflection point (IFP) of new cases in South Korea, Italy, and Iran, utilizing the transcendental model from Hubei and non-Hubei in China. Methods: We extracted data from reports released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (Dec 31, 2019 to Mar 5, 2020) and World Health Organization (Jan 20, 2020 to Mar 5, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the IFP of new cases in Hubei and non-Hubei on subsequent days and the data from Mar 6 to Mar 9 as validation set. New close contacts, newly confirmed cases, cumulative confirmed cases, non-severe cases, severe cases, critical cases, cured cases, and death data were collected and analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, the horizon of the IFP of time (the rate of new increment reaches zero) could be predicted in South Korean, Italy, and Iran. Also, through this model, the global trend of the epidemic will be decoded to allocate international medical resources better and instruct the strategy for quarantine. Results: the optimistic scenario (non-Hubei model, daily increment rate of -3.87%), the relative pessimistic scenario (Hubei model, daily increment rate of -2.20%), and the relatively pessimistic scenario (adjustment, daily increment rate of -1.50%) were inferred and modeling from data in China. Matching and fitting with these scenarios, the IFP of time in South Korea would be Mar 6-Mar 12, Italy Mar 10-Mar 24, and Iran is Mar 10-Mar 24. The numbers of cumulative confirmed patients will reach approximately 20k in South Korea, 209k in Italy, and 226k in Iran under fitting scenarios, respectively. There should be room for improvement if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the IFP will arrive earlier than our estimation. However, with the adoption of different diagnosis criteria, the variation of new cases could impose various influences in the predictive model. If that happens, the IFP of increment will be higher than predicted above. Conclusion: We can affirm that the end of the burst of the epidemic is still inapproachable, and the number of confirmed cases is still escalating. With the augment of data, the world epidemic trend could be further predicted, and it is imperative to consummate the assignment of global medical resources to manipulate the development of COVID-19.","Zheng, Zhong; Wu, Ke; Yao, Zhixian; Zheng, Junhua; Chen, Jian",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033670,223

The objective of this study was to analyse the efficacy of telemedicine (by telephone) in monitoring patients in a coloproctology unit, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method Prospective descriptive study of consecutive patients in a single centre. The result of the teleconsultation was classified as discharge, resolved visit or reprogramming and was analysed by different diagnostic groups. Results From March 19th to April 17th, 2020, the teleconsultation of 190 patients was carried out. The response rate was 94.2% (179). The diagnostic categories of the patients attended were: 51 (26.9%) colorectal neoplasia, 48 (25.3%) proctological pathology, 72 (37.9%) pelvic floor dysfunctions and 19 (10%) other benign pathologies. 105 (55.26%) could be recited as if they had come in person. Eleven (5.8%) patients were discharged. No significant differences were found between the different diagnostic categories and the resolution of the teleconsultation. The reasons for reprogramming are analyzed in the study. Conclusion In the context of a pandemic, teleconsultation has allowed 61% of follow-up visits to be definitively solved, avoiding the reprogramming of 116 patients.

METHODS: During the study period, 237 S. pneumoniae isolates were collected from non-duplicate patients, covering 15.0% of IPD cases in Taiwan. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using a Sensititre® system. A latex agglutination method (ImmuLex™ Pneumotest Kit) was used to determine serotypes. RESULTS: Susceptibility rates were high for vancomycin (100%), teicoplanin (100%) and linezolid (100%), followed by ceftaroline (non-meningitis) (98.3%), moxifloxacin (94.9%) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (89.9%). MIC(50) and MIC(90) values of dalbavancin, telavancin, tedizolid, eravacycline and omadacycline were generally low. Non-vaccine serotype 23A was the leading cause of IPD across the adult age range. Isolates of serotype 15B were slightly fewer than those of PCV-13 serotypes in patients aged ≥65 years. The overall case fatality rate was 15.2% (36/237) but was especially high for non-PCV-13 serotype 15B (21.4%; 3/14). Vaccine coverage was 44.7% for PCV-13 and 49.4% for the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV-23), but was 57% for both PCV-13 and PPSV-23. CONCLUSION: The incidence of IPD was stationary after PCV-13 introduction and only dramatically decreased in the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) values of dalbavancin, telavancin, tedizolid, eravacycline, omadacycline were generally low for S. pneumoniae causing adult IPD.","Chien, Ying-Chun; Lee, Yu-Lin; Liu, Po-Yu; Lu, Min-Chi; Shao, Pei-Lan; Lu, Po-Liang; Cheng, Shu-Hsing; Lin, Chi-Ying; Wu, Ting-Shu; Yen, Muh-Yong; Wang, Lih-Shinn; Liu, Chang-Pan; Lee, Wen-Sen; Shi, Zhi-Yuan; Chen, Yao-Shen; Wang, Fu-Der; Tseng, Shu-Hui; Chen, Yu-Hui; Sheng, Wang-Huei; Lee, Chun-Ming; Chen, Yen-Hsu; Ko, Wen-Chien; Hsueh, Po-Ren",J Glob Antimicrob Resist,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213716521001740; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213716521001740; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34289409/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgar.2021.07.005,223

Parents of college students in Guangzhou, China were invited to participate in an online survey between February 10 and 24, 2020. A total of 193 respondents, aged between 40 and 65 years, completed the study questionnaire. Media exposure was a positive predictor of negative emotions, intergenerational discussions, and preventive behaviors among Chinese middle-aged parents. Conversation orientation was a positive predictor of scientific discussions and preventive behaviors, whereas conformity orientation was a negative predictor of knowledge, but a positive predictor of intergenerational discussions and negative emotions. Intergenerational discussions mediated the relationships between media exposure and preventive behaviors, as well as between FCP and preventive behaviors. Health communication efforts require the help of adult children as intergenerational communication serves as an important amplifier in terms of influencing the health knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of middle-aged and elderly populations.","Gong, Wanqi; Guo, Qin; Jiang, Crystal L.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639506/,223

With aging, the immune system, body physiology, and intestinal microbiota tend to change unfavorably, resulting in many chronic conditions. The immune-mediated disorders can be linked to intestinal dysbiosis, consequently leading to immune dysfunctions and a cluster of conditions such as asthma, autoimmune diseases, eczema, and various allergies. Probiotic bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species are considered probiotic species that have a great immunomodulatory and anti-allergic effect. Moreover, recent scientific and clinical data illustrate that probiotics can regulate the immune system, exert anti-viral and anti-tumoral activity, and shields the host against oxidative stress. Additionally, microbiota programming by probiotic bacteria can reduce and prevent the symptoms of respiratory infections and ameliorate the neurological status in humans. This review describes the most recent clinical findings, including safe probiotic therapies aiming to medicate respiratory infections, allergies, cancer, and neurological disorders due to their physiological interconnection. Subsequently, we will describe the major biological mechanism by which probiotic bacteriotherapy expresses its anti-viral, anti-allergic, anticancer, and neuro-stimulatory effects.","Balta, Igori; Butucel, Eugenia; Mohylyuk, Valentyn; Criste, Adriana; Dezmirean, Daniel Severus; Stef, Lavinia; Pet, Ioan; Corcionivoschi, Nicolae",Diseases,https://doi.org/10.3390/diseases9030060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34562967/,223

This study is aimed at determining the association between psychological factors, including emotional stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep pattern among BMS patients. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 19 patients with idiopathic BMS were enrolled along with a control group equivalent in age and sex, but without BMS. Questionnaires used were the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Demographic information was also recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation among the two groups of BMS and non-BMS patients regarding stress, depression, and sleep disorder. The average severity of the burning score was 8.31 among the patients. Furthermore, a significant correlation was observed among mental disorders and educational level and sex, but not with age. There was also no significant correlation among the severity of the burning score with sex, education, and mental disorder. CONCLUSION: BMS is significantly associated with psychological symptoms. This condition requires proper treatment and support because it can represent psychological or mental issues and/or have a significant effect on daily life.","Rezazadeh, Fahimeh; Farahmand, Farzane; Hosseinpour, Hamidreza; Shahriarirad, Reza; Sabet Eghlidi, Amirhasan",Biomed Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5555316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33791363/,223

METHODS: An anonymous course evaluation survey was conducted at the end of the academic year 2019/2020. The organization of classes due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic provided our students with a unique opportunity to compare online and contact classes. Students’ responses were analyzed according to the type of obtained data (ratio, ordinal, and categorical). RESULTS: The response rate was 95.58%. Approximately 90% of students found anatomical dissection and practical work in general to be the most important aspect of teaching, which could not be replaced by online learning. During online classes, students missed the most the interaction with other students, followed by the interaction with student teaching assistants and teaching staff. Very few students found contact lectures useful, with most students reporting that they could be replaced with recorded video lectures. In contrast, recorded video lectures were perceived as extremely helpful for studying. Regular weekly quizzes were essential during online classes as they gave students adequate feedback and guided their learning process. Students greatly benefitted from additional course materials and interactive lessons, which were made easily available via e-learning platform. CONCLUSIONS: Anatomical dissection and interaction during contact classes remain the most important aspects of teaching anatomy. However, online teaching increases learning efficiency by allowing alternative learning strategies and by substituting certain components of contact classes, thus freeing up more time for practical work.","Banovac, Ivan; Katavić, Vedran; Blažević, Andrea; Bičanić, Ivana; Hladnik, Ana; Kovačić, Nataša; Petanjek, Zdravko",Croat Med J,https://doi.org/10.3325/cmj.2021.62.173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33938657/,223

DESIGN: Rapid response online survey. Participants completed the six-item US Household Food Security Survey Module, a brief measure of food insufficiency, and measures of food behaviours, neighbourhood safety and discrimination. Open-ended questions were used to assess changes in eating behaviours during COVID-19 and needed resources. SETTING: C-EAT (COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time) study invitations were sent by email and text message to a longitudinal cohort. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 218 emerging adults (mean age = 24·6 (sd 2·0) years, 70·2 % female) completed a survey in April–May 2020 during a stay-at-home order in Minnesota. RESULTS: The past year prevalence of food insecurity was 28·4 %. Among food-insecure respondents, 41·0 % reported both eating less and experiencing hunger due to lack of money in the past month. Food-insecure respondents were less likely than those who were food secure to have fruits/vegetables at home and more likely to have frequent fast-food restaurant meals, feel unsafe in their neighbourhood and experience discrimination during the stay-at-home order. Food-insecure adults reported changes including eating more food prepared at home, eating more take-out restaurant meals and purchasing more energy-dense snacks as a result of events related to COVID-19. Resources most needed to support their health included eligibility for more food assistance and relief funds.

Comprehensive profiling was conducted on more than 600 compounds, with each compound arrayed at 10 dose points (ranging from 20 μM to 1 nM). Our screening revealed several FDA-approved agents that act as novel antivirals that block both OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, including lapatinib, doramapimod, and 17-AAG. Importantly, lapatinib inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication by over 50,000-fold without any toxicity and at doses readily achievable in human tissues.

645313,Dynamics and bifurcation analysis of a state-dependent impulsive SIS model,2021-06-12,"BACKGROUND: On December 12th 2019, a new coronavirus (SARS-Cov2) emerged in Wuhan, China, sparking a pandemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans (COVID-19). On the 24th of April 2020, the number of COVID-19 deaths in the world, according to the COVID-Case Tracker by Johns Hopkins University, was 195,313, and the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases was 2,783,512. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a massive impact on human health, causing sudden lifestyle changes, through social distancing and isolation at home, with social and economic consequences. Optimizing public health during this pandemic requires not only knowledge from the medical and biological sciences, but also of all human sciences related to lifestyle, social and behavioural studies, including dietary habits and lifestyle. METHODS: Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating habits and lifestyle changes among the Italian population aged ≥ 12 years. The study comprised a structured questionnaire packet that inquired demographic information (age, gender, place of residence, current employment); anthropometric data (reported weight and height); dietary habits information (adherence to the Mediterranean diet, daily intake of certain foods, food frequency, and number of meals/day); lifestyle habits information (grocery shopping, habit of smoking, sleep quality and physical activity). The survey was conducted from the 5th to the 24th of April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 3533 respondents have been included in the study, aged between 12 and 86 years (76.1% females). The perception of weight gain was observed in 48.6% of the population; 3.3% of smokers decided to quit smoking; a slight increased physical activity has been reported, especially for bodyweight training, in 38.3% of respondents; the population group aged 18–30 years resulted in having a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet when compared to the younger and the elderly population (p < 0.001; p < 0.001, respectively); 15% of respondents turned to farmers or organic, purchasing fruits and vegetables, especially in the North and Center of Italy, where BMI values were lower. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we have provided for the first time data on the Italian population lifestyle, eating habits and adherence to the Mediterranean Diet pattern during the COVID-19 lockdown. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, our data need to be confirmed and investigated in future more extensive population studies.","Di Renzo, Laura; Gualtieri, Paola; Pivari, Francesca; Soldati, Laura; Attinà, Alda; Cinelli, Giulia; Leggeri, Claudia; Caparello, Giovanna; Barrea, Luigi; Scerbo, Francesco; Esposito, Ernesto; De Lorenzo, Antonino",J Transl Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02399-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32513197/,223

Four phages (φX174, PR772, MS2 and φ6) and one eukaryotic virus (murine norovirus MNV-1) were exposed to low ozone concentrations (1.23 ppm for phages and 0.23 ppm for MNV-1) and various levels of RH for 10 to 70 minutes. The inactivation of these viruses was then assessed to determine which of the tested conditions provided the greatest reduction in virus infectivity. An inactivation of at least two orders of magnitude for φX174, MS2 and MNV-1 was achieved with an ozone exposure of 40 minutes at 85% RH. For PR772 and φ6, exposure to the reference condition at 20% RH for 10 minutes yielded the same results. These findings suggest that ozone used at a low concentration is a powerful disinfectant for airborne viruses when combined with a high RH.

647085,Non-universal power-law dynamics of SIR models on hierarchical modular networks,2021-03-12,"Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a great challenge for scientific community globally. Virus enters cell through spike glycoprotein fusion with ACE2 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2) human receptor. Hence, spike glycoprotein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a potential target for diagnostics, vaccines, and antibodies. Also, virus entry can be prevented by blocking ACE2 thus, ACE2 can be considered potential target for therapeutics. As being highly specific, safe and efficacious, peptides hold their place in therapeutics. In present study, we retrieved sequence of 70 peptides from Antiviral Peptide Database (AVPdb), modelled them using 3D structure predicting web tool and docked them with receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein and human host receptor ACE2 using peptide-protein docking. It was observed that peptides have more affinity towards ACE2 in comparison with spike RBD. Interestingly it was noticed that most of the peptides bind to RBM (residue binding motif) which is responsible for ACE2 binding at the interface of RBD while, for ACE2, peptides prefer to bind the core cavity rather than RBD binding interface. To further investigate how peptides at the interface of RBD or ACE2 alter the binding between RBD and ACE2, protein–protein docking of RBD and ACE2 with and without peptides was performed. Peptides, AVP0671 at RBD and AVP1244 at ACE2 interfaces significantly reduce the binding affinity and change the orientation of RBD and ACE2 binding. This finding suggests that peptides can be used as a drug to inhibit virus entry in cells to stop COVID-19 pandemic in the future after experimental evidences.

To reduce ARDS, an ideal approach is to diminish virus loading by activating immune cells for CS prevention, or to suppress the overactive cytokine-releasing immune cells for CS inhibition. Here, a potential radiation-mediated CS regulation is raised by reevaluating the radiation-mediated pneumonia control in the 1920s with the following latent advantages of lung radiotherapy (LR) in treatment of COVID-19: a, Radiation accesses poorly-circulated tissue more efficiently than blood-delivered medications; b, Low dose radiation (LDR)-mediated metabolic rewiring and immune cell activation inhibit virus loading; c, Pre-consumption of immune reserves by LDR decreases CS severity; d, High dose radiation (HDR) within lung-tolerable doses relieves CS by eliminating in situ overactive cytokine-releasing cells. Thus, LDR and HDR or combined with antiviral and life-supporting modalities may mitigate SARS-CoV-2 and other virus-mediated ARDS.","Li, Jian Jian",iScience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.101215; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004220304004?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32512383/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589004220304004,223

649105,Nutritional and Bioactive Components of Pomegranate Waste Used in Food and Cosmetic Applications: A Review,2021-03-19,"RNA structures are unwound for decoding. In the process, they can pause the elongating ribosome for regulation. An example is the stimulation of -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting, leading to 3′ direction slippage of the reading-frame during elongation, by specific pseudoknot stimulators downstream of the frameshifting site. By investigating a recently identified regulatory element upstream of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) −1 frameshifting site, it is shown that a minimal functional element with hairpin forming potential is sufficient to down-regulate−1 frameshifting activity. Mutagenesis to disrupt or restore base pairs in the potential hairpin stem reveals that base-pair formation is required for−1 frameshifting attenuation in vitro and in 293T cells. The attenuation efficiency of a hairpin is determined by its stability and proximity to the frameshifting site; however, it is insensitive to E site sequence variation. Additionally, using a dual luciferase assay, it can be shown that a hairpin stimulated +1 frameshifting when placed upstream of a +1 shifty site in yeast. The investigations indicate that the hairpin is indeed a cis-acting programmed reading-frame switch modulator. This result provides insight into mechanisms governing−1 frameshifting stimulation and attenuation. Since the upstream hairpin is unwound (by a marching ribosome) before the downstream stimulator, this study’s findings suggest a new mode of translational regulation that is mediated by the reformed stem of a ribosomal unwound RNA hairpin during elongation.","Cho, Che-Pei; Lin, Szu-Chieh; Chou, Ming-Yuan; Hsu, Hsiu-Ting; Chang, Kung-Yao",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23638024/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0062283,223

Recent clinical trials of these two drugs for SARS-CoV-2 treatment revealed antiviral efficacies as well as side effects with different extents1–4. As a pyrazine derivative, Favipiravir could be incorporated into the viral RNA products by mimicking both adenine and guanine nucleotides, which may further lead to mutations in progeny RNA copies due to the non-conserved base-pairing capacity5. Here, we determined the cryo-EM structure of Favipiravir bound to the replicating polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 in the pre-catalytic state. This structure provides a missing snapshot for visualizing the catalysis dynamics of coronavirus polymerase, and reveals an unexpected base-pairing pattern between Favipiravir and pyrimidine residues which may explain its capacity for mimicking both adenine and guanine nucleotides.

Clear differentiation was achieved between specimens from infected and uninfected subjects, and a wide range of serum/plasma antibody levels was delineated in infected subjects. All 25 specimens from 18 patients with COVID-19 were positive in the assays with both the trimeric spike and the receptor-binding domain proteins.

651555,Semantic overlay network for large-scale spatial information indexing,2013-04-27,"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: Exaggerated inflammatory response with cytokine storm is the hallmark of moderate to severe cases of COVID-19. Several studies have investigated the use of colchicine in COVID-19 due to its anti-inflammatory effects. However, the data regarding its efficacy is still limited and conflicting. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of colchicine on mortality and the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search of electronic databases from inception through April 10, 2021, for all peer-reviewed studies that evaluated the clinical benefits of colchicine COVID-19 patients. The primary outcome was the mortality rate. The secondary outcomes included the risk of mechanical ventilation, improvement in systematic inflammation as indicated by changes in serum C-reactive protein, and the risk of adverse events. Pooled risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained by the Mantel-Haenszel method within a random-effect model. RESULTS: A total of eight studies involving 926 COVID-19 patients (406 patients received colchicine along with standard-of-care (SOC) therapy and 520 received SOC therapy alone) were included. The mean age was 63.7±14.7 years, and males represented 63.3%. Mortality rate was significantly lower in the colchicine group compared to SOC (RR 0.49 (95% CI: 0.34-0.72, P = 0.0002). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of mechanical ventilation (RR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.31-1.57, P = 0.38). Furthermore, colchicine significantly lowered serum CRP levels (MD -0.40, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.03, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis demonstrated that colchicine showed improvement in mortality in COVID-19 patients. However, there was no significant improvement in the risk of mechanical ventilation. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Colchicine may be a potential therapeutic option for COVID-19. Even though the results are encouraging, we need more large-scale RCTs to better characterize the clinical benefits of colchicine in COVID-19 patients.

651613,Artificial intelligence—the future is now,2021-07-07,"Interferon alpha/beta (IFN-α/β) is a critical mediator of protection against most viruses, with host survival frequently impossible in its absence. Many studies have investigated the pathways involved in the induction of IFN-α/β after virus infection and the resultant upregulation of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) through IFN-α/β receptor complex signaling. However, other than examining the effects of genetic deletion of induction or effector pathway components, little is known regarding the functionality of these responses in intact hosts and whether host genetic or environmental factors might influence their potency. Here, we demonstrate that the IFN-α/β response against multiple arthropod-vectored viruses, which replicate over a wide temperature range, is extremely sensitive to fluctuations in temperature, exhibiting reduced antiviral efficacy at subnormal cellular temperatures and increased efficacy at supranormal temperatures. The effect involves both IFN-α/β and ISG upregulation pathways with a major aspect of altered potency reflecting highly temperature-dependent transcription of IFN response genes that leads to altered IFN-α/β and ISG protein levels. Discordantly, signaling steps prior to transcription that were examined showed the opposite effect from gene transcription, with potentiation at low temperature and inhibition at high temperature. Finally, we demonstrate that by lowering the temperature of mice, chikungunya arbovirus replication and disease are exacerbated in an IFN-α/β-dependent manner. This finding raises the potential for use of hyperthermia as a therapeutic modality for viral infections and in other contexts such as antitumor therapy. The increased IFN-α/β efficacy at high temperatures may also reflect an innate immune-relevant aspect of the febrile response.","Lane, Whitney C.; Dunn, Matthew D.; Gardner, Christina L.; Lam, L. K.

This review aimed to identify currently proposed and/or implemented methods of screening, triaging, and severity scoring suspected COVID-19 patients upon initial presentation to the health care system, and to evaluate the utility of these tools in LRS. A scoping review was conducted to identify studies describing acute screening, triage, and severity scoring of suspected COVID-19 patients published between 12 December, 2019 and 01 April, 2020. Extracted information included clinical features, use of laboratory and imaging studies, and relevant tool validation data. The initial search strategy yielded 15232 articles;124 met inclusion criteria. Results: Most studies were from China (n=41, 33.1%) or the United States (n=23, 18·5%). In total, 57 screening, 54 severity scoring, and 23 triage tools were described. A total of 23 tools–16 screening, four triage, and three severity scoring–were identified as feasible for use in LRS. A total of 37 studies provided validation data: four prospective and 33 retrospective, with none from low-income and lower-middle-income countries. Conclusions: This study identified a number of screening, triage, and severity scoring tools implemented and proposed for suspected COVID-19 patients. No tools were specifically designed and validated in LRS. A tool specific to resource limited context is crucial to reducing mortality in the current pandemic.","Hirner, S. M.; Pigoga, J.

While many factors contribute to reduced demand and supply, we attribute the low amount of coverage to the high levels of capital that would be required to credibly insure pandemic economic losses with cross-sectional pooling mechanisms. Pooling over time significantly reduces the required capital and therefore the cost of insurance, but as a practical matter likely requires a government with the ability to borrow and tax. We also argue that insurance for economic losses due to pandemics likely generates positive externalities for the macroeconomy. We therefore analyze the general tradeoffs associated with different ways that a government can promote such insurance.","Hartwig, Robert; Niehaus, Greg; Qiu, Joseph",Geneva Risk Insur Rev,https://doi.org/10.1057/s10713-020-00055-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32952463/,223

654254,Identification of the ARX Model with Random Impulse Noise Based on Forgetting Factor Multi-error Information Entropy,2021-08-12,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients on kidney replacement therapy (KRT) are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 illness and often require high intensity care and utilisation of hospital resources. During the ongoing pandemic, the optimal care pathway and triage for KRT patients presenting with varying severity of COVID-19 illness is unknown. We studied clinical factors and outcomes associated with admission, readmission and short-term outcomes. METHOD: Data from the European Renal Association COVID-19 Database (ERACODA) was analysed. This database includes granular data on dialysis patients and kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 from all over Europe. The clinical and laboratory features at first presentation of hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients and those who returned for second presentation were studied. In addition, possible predictors of outcome in those who were not hospitalized at first presentation were identified. RESULTS: Among 1,423 KRT patients (haemodialysis; 1017/kidney transplant; 406) with COVID-19, 25% (n=355) were not hospitalized at first presentation. Of them, only 10% (n=36), presented for a second time in the hospital. The median interval between the first and second presentation was 5 days (Interquartile interval: 2-7 days). Patients who re-presented had worsening of pulmonary symptoms, a fall in oxygen saturation (97% to 90%), and an increase in C-reactive protein (26 mg/L to 73 mg/L) between their attendances. Patients who re-presented after initial assessment were older (72 vs. 63 years) and initially more often had pulmonary symptoms and abnormalities on lung imaging compared with those who did not present for a second time. The 28-day mortality rate of patients admitted at the second presentation was similar to that of patients admitted at first presentation (26.5% vs. 29.7%, p=0. 61). Among patients who were not hospitalized at first presentation (mortality 6%), age, prior smoking, clinical frailty scale, and shortness of breath at first presentation were identified as predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION: KRT patients with COVID-19 and mild pulmonary abnormalities and no signs of pulmonary insufficiency can be safely returned without hospitalization. These patients should be advised to seek immediate contact when they develop respiratory distress. Our findings provide support for a risk-stratified clinical approach to admissions of KRT patients presenting with COVID-19. The study findings may be valuable for clinical triage and optimising hospital capacity utilisation during the ongoing pandemic.","Mitra, Sandip; Jayanti, Anu; Vart, Priya; Coca, Armando; Gallieni, Maurizio; Altern Øvrehus, Marius; Midtvedt, Karsten; Abd ElHafeez, Samar; Gandolfini, Ilaria; Büttner, Stefan; Franssen, Casper; Hemmelder, Marc",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab145.003,223
654319,Review of fractional epidemic models,2021-04-20,"The multi-generation heredity trait of hypertension in human has been reported, but the molecular mechanisms underlying multi-generational inheritance of hypertension remain obscure. Recent evidence shows that prenatal inflammatory exposure (PIE) results in increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension. In this study we investigated whether and how PIE contributed to multi-generational inheritance of hypertension in rats. PIE was induced in pregnant rats by intraperitoneal injection of LPS or Poly (I:C) either once on gestational day 10.5 (transient stimulation, T) or three times on gestational day 8.5, 10.5, and 12.5 (persistent stimulation, P). Male offspring was chosen to study the paternal inheritance. We showed that PIE, irrespectively induced by LPS or Poly (I:C) stimulation during pregnancy, resulted in multi-generational inheritance of significantly increased blood pressure in rat descendants, and that prenatal LPS exposure led to vascular remodeling and vasoconstrictor dysfunction in both thoracic aorta and superior mesenteric artery of adult F2 offspring. Furthermore, we revealed that PIE resulted in global alteration of DNA methylome in thoracic aorta of F2 offspring. Specifically, PIE led to the DNA hypomethylation of G beta gamma (Gβγ) signaling genes in both the F1 sperm and the F2 thoracic aorta, and activation of PI3K/Akt signaling was implicated in the pathologic changes and dysregulated vascular tone of aortic tissue in F2 LPS-P offspring. Our data demonstrate that PIE reprogrammed DNA methylome of cells from the germline/mature gametes contributes to the development of hypertension in F2 PIE offspring. This study broadens the current knowledge regarding the multi-generation effect of the cumulative early life environmental factors on the development of hypertension.","Guan, Xiao; Dan, Guo-rong; Yang, Yao; Ji, Yan; Lai, Wen-jing; Wang, Fang-jie; Meng, Meng; Mo, Bang-hui; Huang, Pei; You, Ting-ting; Deng, Ya-fei; Song, Liang; Guo, Wei; Yi, Ping; Yu, Jian-hua; Gao, Yuan; Shou, Wei-nian; Chen, Bing-bo; Deng, You-cai; Li, Xiao-hui",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41401-021-00772-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34593973/,223

The second is to revive the U.S. economy and the livelihood of millions of Americans. In this paper, a team of researchers from the Center on Stochastic Modeling, Optimization, & Statistics (COSMOS) at the University of Texas at Arlington, in collaboration with researchers from University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, has formulated a computationally-efficient optimization framework, referred to as COSMOS COVID-19 Linear Programming (CC19LP), to study the delicate balance between the expected fatality rate and the level of normalcy in the community. Given the disproportionate fatality characteristics of COVID-19 among those in different age groups or with an underlying medical condition or those living with crowding, the key to the CC19LP framework is a focus on ""key contacts"" that separate individuals at higher risk from the rest of the population. The philosophy of CC19LP lies in maximizing protection of key contacts, so as to shield high-risk individuals from infection. Given the lack of pharmaceutical solutions, i.e., a vaccine or cure, the CC19LP framework minimizes expected fatalities by optimizing the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions, namely COVID-19 testing; personal protective equipment; and social precautions, such as distancing, hand-washing, and face coverings. Low-risk individuals that are not key contacts, including most children, are unrestricted and can choose to participate in pre-pandemic normal activities, which eliminates the need for compliance across the entire population. Consequently, the CC19LP framework demonstrates optimal strategies for protecting high-risk individuals while reopening communities.","Chen, V. C.

METHODS: COVID-19 survivors were recruited for high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the thorax, lung function and serum levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody tests 3 months after discharge. The relationship between the clinical characteristics and the pulmonary function or CT scores were investigated. FINDINGS: Fifty-five recovered patients participated in this study. SARS-CoV-2 infection related symptoms were detected in 35 of them and different degrees of radiological abnormalities were detected in 39 patients. Urea nitrogen concentration at admission was associated with the presence of CT abnormalities (P = 0.046, OR 7.149, 95% CI 1.038 to 49.216). Lung function abnormalities were detected in 14 patients and the measurement of D-dimer levels at admission may be useful for prediction of impaired diffusion defect (P = 0.031, OR 1.066, 95% CI 1.006 to 1.129). Of all the subjects, 47 of 55 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum, among which the generation of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody in female patients was stronger than male patients in infection rehabilitation phase. INTERPRETATION: Radiological and physiological abnormalities were still found in a considerable proportion of COVID-19 survivors without critical cases 3 months after discharge. Higher level of D-dimer on admission could effectively predict impaired DLCO after 3 months discharge.

Initially, meat and meat products' prices increased due to less production and increased demand because of panic buying. Whereas, later on, both meat production and demand were significantly decreased due to lockdown restrictions and lower purchasing power of the consumers that results in a decrease in meat prices. In early April 2020, meat packing facilities started to shut down due to the rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus among workers. Furthermore, meat producers and processors faced difficulty in harvesting and shipment of the products due to lockdown situations, decrease in labor force, restrictions in movement of animals within and across the country and change in legislation of local and international export market. These conditions adversely impacted the meat industry due to decrease in meat production, processing and distribution facilities.

These systems use facial infrared emissions to detect individuals exhibiting an elevated core-body temperature, which is present in many symptomatic presentations of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite the rollout of these systems, there is little independent research supporting their efficacy. The primary objective of this study was to assess the precision and accuracy of IRT screening solutions in a real-world scenario. The method used was a single-centre, observational study investigating the agreement of three IRT systems compared to digital oral thermometer measurements of body temperature. Over 5 days, 107 measurements were taken from individuals wearing facial masks. During each entry, two measurements of the subject’s body temperature were made from each system to allow for the evaluation of the measurement precision, followed by an oral thermometer measurement. Each participant also answered a short demographic survey. This study found that the precision of the IRT systems was wider than 0.3 °C claimed accuracy of two of the systems. This study also found that the IRT measurements were only weakly correlated to those of the oral temperature. Additionally, it was found that demographic characteristics (age, gender, and mask-type) impacted the measurement error. This study indicates that using IRT systems in front-line scenarios poses a potential risk, where a lack of measurement accuracy could possibly allow febrile individuals to pass through undetected.

At the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), data collected from various laboratory data recording systems are consolidated. First, this article aims to exemplify significant aspects regarding test procedures. Subsequently the different systems for recording laboratory tests are described and test numbers from the RKI test laboratory query and the laboratory-based SARS-CoV‑2 surveillance as well as accounting data from the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians for SARS-CoV‑2 laboratory tests are shown. Early in the pandemic, the RKI test laboratory query and the laboratory-based SARS-CoV‑2 surveillance became available and able to evaluate data on performed tests and test capacities. By recording the positive and negative test results, statements about the total number of tests and the proportion of positive test rates can be made. While the aggregate test numbers are largely representative nationwide, they are not always representative at the state and district level.

We investigated public perceptions of the UK government COVID-19 response, focusing on the relationship between trust and transparency, during the first wave (April 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Methods: Anonymous survey data were collected (2020-04-06 to 2020-04-22) from 9,322 respondents, aged 20+ using an online questionnaire. We took a mixed methods approach to data analysis, combining statistical analyses, structural topic modelling (STM) and qualitative thematic coding of a sub-set of responses. Missing data were imputed via multiple imputation. Results: Most respondents (95.1%) supported government enforcement of behaviour change. While 52.1% of respondents thought the government was making good decisions, differences were apparent across demographic groups, for example respondents from Scotland had lower odds of responding positively than respondents in London. Higher educational levels saw decreasing odds of having a positive opinion of the government response and decreasing household income associated with decreasing positive opinion. Of respondents who thought the government was not making good decisions 60% believed the economy was being prioritised over people and their health. Positive views on government decision-making were associated with positive views on government transparency about the COVID-19 response. Qualitative analysis about government transparency highlighted five key themes: (1) the justification of opacity due to the condition of crisis, (2) generalised mistrust of politics, (3) concerns about the role of scientific evidence, (4) quality of government communication and (5) questions about political decision-making processes. Conclusion: We recommend targeted community engagement tailored to different groups experiences and a focus on accountability and openness around how decisions are made in the response to the UK COVID-19 pandemic.","Enria, L.; Waterlow, N.; Rogers, N.

Spontaneous muscle hematoma (SMH) is a rare complication in COVID-19. The aims of this study are to: (1) perform a systematic review of the literature to better define the clinical SMH characteristics, (2) describe the prevalence and the clinical characteristics of SMH in COVID-19 patients referring to a Department of Internal Medicine (IM) (Federico II University of Naples), a Department of Sub-Intensive Care Medicine (SIM) (Ospedale Del Mare), and a Department of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (Federico II University). The systematic review was performed according to PRISMA criteria. The local prevalence of SMH in COVID-19 was evaluated retrospectively. The medical records of all COVID-19 patients referring to IM and ICU from March 11th, 2020, to February 28th, 2021 were examined for SMH occurrence. In our retrospective analysis, we describe 10 cases of COVID-19 patients with SMH not previously reported in literature, with a prevalence of 2.1%. The literature review, inclusive of our case series, describes a total of 50 SMHs in COVID-19 patients (57.4% males; mean age 68.8 ± 10.0 years). The SMH sites were ileo-psoas, vastus intermedius, gluteus, sternocleidomastoid, and pectoralis major muscles. Males developed SMH earlier than females (9.5 ± 7.8 vs. 17.1 ± 9.7 days). Ileo-psoas hematoma was more frequent in males (69.2 vs. 30.8%), while pectoralis major hematoma occurred only in females. The in-hospital mortality rate of SMH in COVID-19 patients was 32.4%. SMH is a rare but severe complication in COVID-19 hospitalized patients, associated with high mortality.

The medical community is struggling to cope with the critical illness associated with the disease. On top of that, patients who have recovered from COVID-19 have presented with complications such as thrombotic episodes in various organs both during and after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. A COVID-19-associated prothrombotic state has been mentioned in multiple recent research articles. The role of anticoagulants is debatable, because even after receiving them prophylactically, many patients have experienced thrombotic episodes. The situation, therefore, represents a challenge to the medical community. CASE REPORT: We report on a COVID-19-associated prothrombotic state in a 65-year-old man with no history of comorbid illness. Initially, he presented with right-sided weakness and was found to have had an acute ischemic stroke. Urgent imaging after the stroke revealed changes on electrocardiography that were remarkable for left bundle branch block. The patient’s elevated cardiac enzyme levels correlated with a silent acute myocardial infarction (MI). His echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular (LV) thrombus. He was managed with a multidisciplinary approach involving Neurology, Cardiology, and Medicine. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-associated prothrombotic episodes involving arterial and venous systems have been reported in the literature. But concomitant stroke, acute MI, and LV thrombus rarely have been documented. The role of prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation is still unclear because even when patients are on these drugs, they continue to develop thrombotic episodes. Indeed, further studies are required to develop a standard management plan for what can be a fatal situation.","Iqbal, Phool; Laswi, Bushra; Jamshaid, Muhammad Bilal; Shahzad, Aamir; Chaudhry, Hammad Shabir; Khan, Dawlat; Qamar, Muhammad Sohaib; Yousaf, Zohaib",Am J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33446625/; https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.928852,223

A previous study using the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) has demonstrated that prespecified state anxiety predicts moderate risk-taking (middle-risk/high-return) after salient penalty events under temporal pressure and information ambiguity. Such moderate risk-taking can be used as a behavioral background in the case of fraud damage. We conducted two psychophysiological experiments using the IGT and used a psychophysiological modeling approach to examine how moderate risk-taking under temporal pressure and information ambiguity is associated with automatic physiological responses, such as a skin conductance response (SCR). The first experiment created template SCR functions under concurrent temporal pressure and information ambiguity. The second experiment produced a convolution model using the SCR functions and fitted the model to the SCR time series recorded under temporal pressure and no temporal pressure, respectively. We also collected the participants’ anxiety profiles before the IGT experiment. The first finding indicated that participants with higher state anxiety scores yielded better model fitting (that is, event-related physiological responses) under temporal pressure. The second finding demonstrated that participants with better model fitting made consecutive Deck A selections under temporal pressure more frequently. In summary, a psychophysiological modeling approach is effective for capturing overlapping SCRs and moderate risk-taking under concurrent temporal pressure and information ambiguity is associated with automatic physiological and emotional reactivity.","Soshi, Takahiro; Nagamine, Mitsue; Fukuda, Emiko; Takeuchi, Ai",Brain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34573144/; https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11091122,223

666021,Protecting against Covid‐19 aerosols,2021-07-23,"ABSTRACT: The severe pneumonia caused by the human coronavirus (hCoV)-SARS-CoV-2 has inflicted heavy casualties, especially among the elderly and those with co-morbid illnesses irrespective of their age. The high mortality in African-Americans and males, in general, raises the concern for a possible X-linked mediated process that could affect the viral pathogenesis and the immune system. We hypothesized that G6PD, the most common X-linked enzyme deficiency, associated with redox status, may have a role in severity of pneumonia. Retrospective chart review was performed in hospitalized patients with COVID19 pneumonia needing supplemental oxygen. A total of 17 patients were evaluated: six with G6PD deficiency (G6PDd) and 11 with normal levels. The two groups (normal and G6PDd) were comparable in terms of age, sex, co-morbidities, and laboratory parameters—LDH, IL-6, CRP, and ferritin, respectively. Thirteen patients needed ventilatory support ; 8 in the normal group and 5 in the G6PDd group (72% vs.83%). The main differences indicating increasing severity in normal vs. G6PDd groups included G6PD levels (12.2 vs. 5.6, P = 0.0002), PaO2/FiO2 ratio (159 vs. 108, P = 0.05), days on mechanical ventilation (10.25 vs. 21 days P = 0.04), hemoglobin level (10 vs. 8.1 P = 0.03), and hematocrit (32 vs. 26 P = 0.015). Only one patient with G6PDd died; 16 were discharged home. Our clinical series ascribes a possible biological role for G6PDd in SARS-CoV2 viral proliferation. It is imperative that further studies are performed to understand the interplay between the viral and host factors in G6PDd that may lead to disparity in outcomes. KEY POINTS: • COVID19 studies show higher mortality in men, due to severe pneumonia and ARDS, indicating possible X-linked mediated differences • G6PD, the most common X-linked enzymopathy, highly prevalent in African Americans and Italians, maintains redox homeostasis. • Preclinical studies using G6PD deficient (G6PDd) cells infected with human coronavirus (hCoV), show impaired cellular responses, viral proliferation and worsening oxidative damage. • Retrospective chart review in hospitalized patients with COVID19 pneumonia needing supplemental oxygen shows differences between the two groups (Normal and G6PDd) in hematological indices; the G6PDdgroup demonstrated prolonged PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and longer days on mechanical ventilation indicating the severity of the pneumonia.","Youssef, Jihad G.; Zahiruddin, Faisal; Youssef, George; Padmanabhan, Sriram; Ensor, Joe; Pingali, Sai Ravi; Zu, Youli; Sahay, Sandeep; Iyer, Swaminathan P.",Ann Hematol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00277-021-04395-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33439304/,223

Improved infection prevention and control (IPC) programmes can protect HCWs, especially in resource-limited settings where the health workforce is scarcest, and ensure patient safety and continuity of essential health services. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we collaborated with ministries of health and development partners to implement an emergency initiative for HCWs at the primary health facility level in 22 African countries. Between April 2020 and January 2021, the initiative trained 42 058 front-line HCWs from 8444 health facilities, supported longitudinal supervision and monitoring visits guided by a standardised monitoring tool, and provided resources including personal protective equipment (PPE). We documented significant short-term improvements in IPC performance, but gaps remain. Suspected HCW infections peaked at 41.5% among HCWs screened at monitored facilities in July 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic in Africa. Disease-specific emergency responses are not the optimal approach. Comprehensive, sustainable IPC programmes are needed. IPC needs to be incorporated into all HCW training programmes and combined with supportive supervision and mentorship. Strengthened data systems on IPC are needed to guide improvements at the health facility level and to inform policy development at the national level, along with investments in infrastructure and sustainable supplies of PPE. Multimodal strategies to improve IPC are critical to make health facilities safer and to protect HCWs and the communities they serve.","Patel, Leena N; Kozikott, Samantha; Ilboudo, Rodrigue; Kamateeka, Moreen; Lamorde, Mohammed; Subah, Marion; Tsiouris, Fatima; Vorndran, Anna; Lee, Christopher T",BMJ Glob Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-005833; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34083244/,223

Host epithelial cells are specially enriched for pattern recognition receptors that activate immune response genes to limit viral replication. A prominently expressed set of these genes encodes cytokines that orchestrate key aspects of host defense, such as recruitment of immune cells and repair of epithelial cell damage. Under some circumstances, airway epithelial cells may be programmed to release cytokines (notably IL-33) that activate a type 2 immune response, which in excess might contribute to the development of chronic obstructive lung disease. Moreover, long-term epithelial progenitor cells with this capability may explain an ongoing susceptibility to lung disease in response to acute respiratory infection or other types of inhaled danger signals. The mucosal airway epithelial cell can thereby mediate a beneficial response for host defense and a detrimental response leading to inflammatory disease.","Alexander-Brett, Jennifer; Holtzman, Michael J.",Mucosal Immunology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124158474000537; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124158474000537,223

However, the inference of outbreak transmission histories remains challenging due to various factors such as within-host pathogen diversity and multi-strain infections. Current computational methods ignore within-host diversity and/or multi-strain infections, often failing to accurately infer the transmission history. Thus, there is a need for efficient computational methods for transmission tree inference that accommodate the complexities of real data. RESULTS: We formulate the direct transmission inference (DTI) problem for inferring transmission trees that support multi-strain infections given a timed phylogeny and additional epidemiological data. We establish hardness for the decision and counting version of the DTI problem. We introduce Transmission Tree Uniform Sampler (TiTUS), a method that uses SATISFIABILITY to almost uniformly sample from the space of transmission trees. We introduce criteria that prioritize parsimonious transmission trees that we subsequently summarize using a novel consensus tree approach.

Patients greater than 18 years of age with laboratory-confirmed, symptomatic COVID-19 and HM diagnoses were included in this study. The primary outcome is a composite of severe COVID-19 illness (composed of mechanical ventilation, severe illness requiring hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) requirement, or death); mechanical ventilation, ICU level of care, supplemental oxygen, and 30-day mortality are reported as secondary outcomes. Baseline characteristics are reported for the entire cohort. Reported clinical outcomes are stratified by cancer type, cancer status, line of therapy received (never treated, first, second or later), receipt of cellular therapy or transplant (none, within 12 months, >12 months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis), last receipt of cytotoxic therapy (within 4 weeks, 1-3 months, 3-12 months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis), and receipt of HM therapies under investigation as repurposed treatments for COVID-19 (Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors). Results: From March 17, 2020 to July 31, 2020, a total of 757 patients with HM and COVID-19 were enrolled and met inclusion criteria. Median follow-up was 30 days (IQR 17-70 days). Median age was 65 years (IQR 55-75), 62% (470) were over age 60, 57% were men, 45% were non-Hispanic white (22% Black, 18% Hispanic, 5% other), 39% were former or current smokers, 27% were obese, 18% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≥2, and 51% were on active treatment within 3 months of COVID-19 diagnosis. Among patients with HM, 281 (37%) developed the primary endpoint. Five-hundred and eleven patients (67%) were hospitalized (some with non-severe disease), 188 (25%) required ICU level of care, 133 (18%) required mechanical ventilation, 409 (54%) required supplemental oxygen, and 143 (19%) died within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Stratified rates of severe outcomes are shown in the Table. The rate of severe COVID-19 was highest in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (53%), and lowest in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (23%). Patients receiving cytotoxic systemic therapy within 3 months of COVID-19 diagnosis had higher rates of severe COVID-19 (41%) and 30-day mortality (28%) than patients who completed treatment 3-12 months (26% severe COVID-19, 16% 30-day mortality) or more than 12 months (29% severe COVID-19, 13% 30-day mortality) prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients receiving cellular therapy or transplant within a year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis had similar rates of severe COVID-19 (36% v. 38%) and 30-day mortality (23% v. 19%) to patients who had not received such therapies within a year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients on second-line or later therapy experienced similar rates of poor outcomes (42% severe COVID-19, 20% 30-day mortality) to patients on first-line therapy (39% severe COVID-19, 18% 30-day mortality) and untreated patients (42% severe COVID-19, 20% 30-day mortality). Outcomes for patients receiving therapies under investigation as repurposed COVID-19 treatments were similar to the cohort at large. Conclusions: This is the largest cohort study to date describing COVID-19 outcomes in patients with HM. Rates of severe COVID-19 outcomes including death were high. Unadjusted rates of severe COVID-19 outcomes were higher in patients with previously described risk factors such as advanced age, poor performance status, and progressive disease, as well as those receiving recent cytotoxic therapy. Outcomes varied widely by malignancy but were similar across treatment contexts. Additional data collection and analyses are ongoing.

677311,An intelligent Chatbot using deep learning with Bidirectional RNN and attention model,2020-06-10,"IMPORTANCE: In late December 2019, an outbreak of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China. Data on the routes of transmission to Los Angeles, California, the US West Coast epicenter for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and subsequent community spread are limited. OBJECTIVE: To determine the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 to Southern California and elucidate local community spread within the Los Angeles metropolitan area. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case series included 192 consecutive patients with reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results positive for SARS-CoV-2 who were evaluated at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, from March 22 to April 15, 2020. Data analysis was performed from April to May 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes were sequenced. Los Angeles isolates were compared with genomes from global subsampling and from New York, New York; Washington state; and China to determine potential sources of viral dissemination. Demographic data and outcomes were collected. RESULTS: The cohort included 192 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 59.5 [43-75] years; 110 [57.3%] men). The genetic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the Los Angeles population pinpointed community transmission of 13 patients within a 3.81 km(2) radius. Variation landscapes of this case series also revealed a cluster of 10 patients that contained 5 residents at a skilled nursing facility, 1 resident of a nearby skilled nursing facility, 3 health care workers, and a family member of a resident of one of the skilled nursing facilities. Person-to-person transmission was detected in a cluster of 5 patients who shared the same single-nucleotide variation in their SARS-CoV-2 genomes. High viral genomic diversity was identified: 20 Los Angeles isolates (15.0%) resembled SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Asia, while 109 Los Angeles isolates (82.0%) were similar to isolates originating from Europe. Analysis of other common respiratory viral pathogens did not reveal coinfection in the cohort. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings highlight the precision of detecting person-to-person transmission and accurate contact tracing directly through SARS-CoV-2 genome isolation and sequencing. Development and application of phylogenetic analyses from the Los Angeles population established connections between COVID-19 clusters locally and throughout the US.","Zhang, Wenjuan; Govindavari, John Paul; Davis, Brian D.; Chen, Stephanie S.; Kim, Jong Taek; Song, Jianbo; Lopategui, Jean; Plummer, Jasmine T.; Vail, Eric",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33026453/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.24191,223

This study analyses the factors associated with intent to vaccinate against COVID-19 in the Pakistani population. METHODOLOGY This cross-sectional, anonymous, online survey was carried out in April 2021. Participants' demographic details, experiences relating to COVID-19 and its vaccination, and their health beliefs were inquired and divided across Health Belief Model constructs. Multivariable regression was used to determine factors associated with a No/Not sure vs Yes response for vaccination intention. RESULTS Of the 655 respondents, 62.0% were willing to get vaccinated. Significant predictors of a less likelihood of resisting vaccination included advanced age (AOR 0.25; 95% CI 0.07-0.88), fear of contracting COVID-19 (AOR 0.47; 95% CI 0.27-0.82), hope of preventing its spread (AOR 0.30; 95% CI 0.19-0.49), and community pressure (AOR 0.22; 95% CI 0.13-0.37). Concerns about vaccine reliability (AOR 2.75; 95% CI 1.67-4.53), and religious inhibitions (AOR 2.45; 95% CI 1.34-4.48) swayed people away from vaccination. CONCLUSION Despite a reasonably good response of Pakistanis to vaccination, factors negatively influencing their intention need to be timely addressed to control this pandemic.","Ahmed, Tehniat F; Ahmed, Affan; Ahmed, Sheharyar; Ahmed, Haadi U",Expert review of vaccines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34348062/; https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1964963,223

Study design Quantitative, longitudinal. Methodology Publicly available data on quarterly uptake of the five adult screening programmes in England were obtained from Public Health England (PHE). Trends from 2017 to 2021 were reviewed and discussed. Results From 2019-2020 Q4 there were substantial reductions in performance in four of the five national screening programmes that were not in keeping with recent trends. Conclusion The reductions in screening performance coincide with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic in England, and may be explained by the temporary suspension of national screening programmes, and the inability or unwillingness of invitees to partake in screening once the programmes had been restored. Due to the delay in publication of the analysed data, further COVID-19 lockdowns in recent months make it probable that the current true screening performance figures are substantially lower than those presented in this paper. The impact on screening programme performance is likely to be detrimental to patient outcomes, meaning remedial action is urgently required.","Armitage, Richard C.; Morling, Joanne R.",Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.07.022; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350621002924?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34461451/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350621002924,223

682187,Primary Prevention Statins in Older Patients: The Good News or the Bad News First?,2020-07-07,"A robust and reliable cell culture system for serum-derived HCV (HCVser) has not been established yet because of the presence of neutralizing antibody and tropism for infection. To overcome this obstacle, we employed a lipid-mediated protein intracellular delivery reagent (PIDR) that permits internalization of proteins into cells. Although entry of HCVcc was not enhanced by the treatment with PIDR, entry of HCVser into hepatoma cell lines (Huh7 and HepG2) and immortalized primary hepatocytes (Hc and HuS/E2) was significantly enhanced by the PIDR treatment. The entry of HCVser into Huh7 cells in the presence of PIDR was resistant to the neutralization by an anti-hCD81 antibody, suggesting that PIDR is capable of internalizing HCVser in a receptor-independent manner. Interestingly, the PIDR-mediated entry of HCVser and HCVcc was enhanced by the addition of sera from chronic hepatitis C patients but not from healthy donors. In addition, neutralization of HCVcc infection by anti-E2 antibody was canceled by the treatment with PIDR. In conclusion, the PIDR is a valuable tool to get over the obstacle of neutralizing antibodies to internalize HCV into cells and might be useful for the establishment of in vitro propagation HCVser.","Fukuhara, Takasuke; Tani, Hideki; Shiokawa, Mai; Goto, Yukinori; Abe, Takayuki; Taketomi, Akinobu; Shirabe, Ken; Maehara, Yoshihiko; Matsuura, Yoshiharu",Microbes Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457911000220; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2011.01.005; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457911000220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21262370/,223

Social media has the potential to convey benefits and facilitate engagement among this target group. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the reach and engagement of specific social media posts among pregnant women and mothers with substance use disorders. METHODS: Eighteen posts providing content related to substance use (cannabis, opioids, or alcohol), varying in type of content (informational or experiential) and target (policy-, practice-, or perception-related), were posted in a closed Facebook community page comprising over 33,000 pregnant women and mothers between May 2019 and October 2019. RESULTS: The overall level of reach of these Facebook posts ranged from 453 to 3045 community members. Engagement levels, measured via the number of likes, comments, or posts shared, varied based on the type of post content (ie, informational or experiential). CONCLUSIONS: Participation in a virtual community via social media platforms can facilitate engagement among pregnant women and mothers with mental illness by communicating relevant information about substance use, as well as potentially promoting awareness of, access to, and engagement with treatment services.","Mazel, Shayna; Zisman-Ilani, Yaara; Hennig, Shannon; Garnick, Deborah; Nicholson, Joanne",JMIR Form Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/24353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34184993/,223
684982,Government royalties on sales of biomedical products developed with substantial public funding,2020-08-19,"BACKGROUND: Acne is a chronic, inflammatory and debilitating skin disorder. Dietary factors and nutritional status are among the exacerbating factors of acne. Phase angle (PhA), a direct measure of Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA), represents an indicator of the chronic inflammatory state. The Mediterranean diet (MD) is a healthy dietary pattern that can exert anti-inflammatory effects in several inflammatory diseases. We aimed to investigate the difference in PhA and adherence to the MD and their associations with the severity of acne in a sample of naïve treatment patients with acne compared to control group. MATERIALS: In this cross-sectional, case–control, observational study, we enrolled 51 patients with acne and 51 control individuals. Body composition was evaluated by a BIA phase-sensitive system (50 kHz BIA 101 RJL, Akern Bioresearch, Florence, Italy, Akern). For adherence to the MD, we have used the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) questionnaire. The clinical severity of acne was assessed by using the global acne grading system (GAGS), a quantitative scoring system to assess acne severity. RESULTS: Patients with acne had a worse body composition, in particular smaller PhA (p = 0.003), and a lower adherence to the MD (p < 0.001) than the control group, in spite of no differences in gender, age and BMI between the two groups. Stratifying patients with acne according to GAGS categories, both PhA (p = 0.006) and PREDIMED score (p = 0.007) decreased significantly in severe acne than mild/moderate acne. The GAGS score was negative correlations with PhA (r = − 0.478, p < 0.001) and PREDIMED score (r = − 0.504, p < 0.001). The results of the multivariate analysis showed PhA and PREDIMED score were the major determinants of GAGS score (p < 0.001). The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis reporting a value of PhA of ≤ 6.1° and a PREDIMED score of ≤ 9 identified patients with acne with the highest clinical severity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Novel correlations were reported between PhA and the degree of adherence to the MD with acne severity. Of interest, PhA and PREDIMED scores might represent possible markers of the severity of acne in a clinical setting. This study highlights how a cooperation between dermatologist and nutritionists might provide a combination key in the complex management of acne patients.","Barrea, Luigi; Donnarumma, Marianna; Cacciapuoti, Sara; Muscogiuri, Giovanna; De Gregorio, Ludovica; Blasio, Chiara; Savastano, Silvia; Colao, Annamaria; Fabbrocini, Gabriella",J Transl Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-021-02826-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33902622/,223

However, studies on the infection status of medical personnel is still lacking. A total of 54 cases of SARS‐Cov‐2 infected medical staff from Tongji Hospital between 7 January and 11 February 2020 were analyzed in this retrospective study. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were compared between different groups by statistical method. From 7 January to 11 February 2020, 54 medical staff of Tongji Hospital were hospitalized due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19). Most of them were from other clinical departments (72.2%) rather than emergency department (3.7%) or medical technology departments (18.5%). Among the 54 patients with COVID‐19, the distribution of age had a significant difference between non‐severe type and severe/critical cases (median age: 47 years vs 38 years; P = .0015). However, there was no statistical difference in terms of gender distribution and the first symptoms between theses two groups. Furthermore, we observed that the lesion regions in SARS‐Cov‐2 infected lungs with severe‐/critical‐type of medical staff were more likely to exhibit lesions in the right upper lobe (31.7% vs 0%; P = .028) and right lung (61% vs 18.2%; P = .012).

As the rest of Africa prepares to receive COVID-19 vaccines, most countries in Africa have set up national-level coordination committees for developing national vaccination deployment plans. While the main focus of these committees has been on setting up strategies that facilitate the swift distribution of COVID-19 vaccines once they are available, the role of effective public health awareness should not be ignored. Countries must devise strategies on how best to enhance public understanding and curb misinformation about the vaccines.

To date, there is no specific therapy for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Flavonoids, especially rutin, have attracted considerable interest as a prospective SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) inhibitor. In this study, a database containing 2017 flavone analogs was prepared and screened against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) using the molecular docking technique. According to the results, 371 flavone analogs exhibited good potency towards M(pro) with docking scores less than −9.0 kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, followed by molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding energy calculations, were performed for the top potent analogs in complex with M(pro). Compared to rutin, PubChem-129-716-607 and PubChem-885-071-27 showed better binding affinities against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) over 150 ns MD course with ΔG(binding) values of −69.0 and −68.1 kcal/mol, respectively. Structural and energetic analyses demonstrated high stability of the identified analogs inside the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) active site over 150 ns MD simulations. The oral bioavailabilities of probable SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibitors were underpinned using drug-likeness parameters. A comparison of the binding affinities demonstrated that the MM/GBSA binding energies of the identified flavone analogs were approximately three and two times less than those of lopinavir and baicalein, respectively.
