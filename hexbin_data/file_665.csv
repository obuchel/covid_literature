Rev Esp Cardiol. 2021;74:362-363,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) are important causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality in developing countries. We reviewed the incidence and the pathogens involved in HAI among infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICU) in Brazil. METHODS: A search was conducted in the MEDLINE, LILACS and SciELO databases from January 1995 to October 2019. Two authors scrutinized potential articles independently, after one author selected them from screening abstracts from every article flagged as related to neonatal HAI. Then, they were included in the review if they met our inclusion criteria. The studies were evaluated based on a quality score proposed by the authors, rated 0 to 1, with 1 point as the best quality rate. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for HAI cumulative incidence and incidence density were calculated, when the same denominators were available, using meta-analysis. A quality effect was applied to the models using the MetaXL software. Heterogeneity was assessed using I(2) statistics and the Cochran’s Q test. RESULTS: Of a total of 5596 citations identified, 15 studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, which comprised 24,408 patients and 312,744 patient-days. Quality of the studies varied between 0.36 and 1 according to the adopted score, and six (40.0%) studies presented a score of 1. Pooled HAI incidence was 36.1 (95% CI 22.8–50.7) infections and 26.3 (95% CI 18.4–35.0) infected patients per 100 patients. Pooled HAI incidence density was 23.5 (95% CI 16.3–33.9) per 1000 patient-days. Pooled incidence density rates of bloodstream infection and ventilator-associated pneumonia were 13.1 per 1000 catheter-days (95% CI 4.3–40.1) and 7.9 per 1000 ventilator-days (95% CI 1.1–55.5), respectively. A high degree of heterogeneity was observed in all models (I(2) > 98% and Cochran’s Q test with p < 0.05). Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (32.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.8%) and Klebsiella spp. (12.4%) were the most prevalent causative bacterial pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show high incidence of neonatal HAI in Brazilian NICU; therefore, efforts to standardize the collection and notification of HAI are needed in order to strengthen surveillance in the country and implement preventive measures, routine assessment, and close monitoring of neonates.","de Mello Freitas, Felipe Teixeira; Viegas, Anna Paula Bise; Romero, Gustavo Adolfo Sierra",Arch Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8167304/,665

24392,Nederlands-Engels,2016-08-18,"In this chapter, we discuss two critical issues which must be remembered whenever we examine epidemiologic data of directly transmitted infectious diseases. Firstly, we would like the readers to recognize the difference between observable and unobservable events in infectious disease epidemiology. Since both infection event and acquisition of infectiousness are generally not directly observable, the total number of infected individuals could not be counted at a point of time, unless very rigorous contact tracing and microbiological examinations were performed. Directly observable intrinsic parameters, such as the incubation period and serial interval, play key roles in translating observable to unobservable information. Secondly, the concept of dependent happening must be remembered to identify a risk of an infectious disease or to assess vaccine efficacy. Observation of a single infected individual is not independent of observing other individuals. A simple solution for dependent happening is to employ the transmission probability which is conditioned on an exposure to infection.","Nishiura, Hiroshi; Kakehashi, Masayuki; Inaba, Hisashi",Mathematical and Statistical Estimation Approaches in Epidemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120684/,665
35567,Atrium,2020-06-29,"OBJECTIVES: Dietary fiber increases the abundance of bacteria that metabolize fiber into short-chain fatty acids and confers resistance against gut colonization with multidrug-resistant bacteria. This pilot trial estimated the effect of fiber on gut short-chain fatty acid–producing bacteria in the ICU. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, open label trial. SETTING: Medical ICU. PATIENTS: Twenty ICU adults receiving broad-spectrum IV antibiotics for sepsis. INTERVENTION: 1:1 randomization to enteral nutrition with mixed soy- and oat-derived fiber (14.3 g fiber/L) versus calorie- and micronutrient-identical enteral nutrition with 0 g/L fiber. MEASUREMENTS: Rectal swabs and whole stools were collected at baseline and on study Days 3, 7, 14, and 30. The primary outcome was within-individual change in the cumulative relative abundance of short-chain fatty acid–producing taxa from baseline to Day 3 based on 16S sequencing of rectal swabs. The secondary outcome was Day 3 cumulative short-chain fatty acid levels based on mass spectrometry of whole stools. Analyses were all intent to treat. MAIN RESULTS: By Day 3, the fiber group received a median of 32.1 g fiber cumulatively (interquartile range, 17.6–54.6) versus 0 g fiber (interquartile range, 0–4.0) in the no fiber group. The median within-individual change in short-chain fatty acid producer relative abundance from baseline to Day 3 was +61% (interquartile range −51 to +1,688) in the fiber group versus −46% (interquartile range, −78 to +13) in the no fiber group (p = 0.28). Whole stool short-chain fatty acid levels on Day 3 were a median of 707 μg short-chain fatty acids/g stool (interquartile range, 190–7,265) in the fiber group versus 118 μg short-chain fatty acids/g stool (interquartile range, 22–1,195) in the no fiber group (p = 0.16). CONCLUSIONS: Enteral fiber was associated with nonsignificant trends toward increased relative abundance of short-chain fatty acid–producing bacteria and increased short-chain fatty acid levels among ICU patients receiving broad-spectrum IV antibiotics. Larger studies should be undertaken and our results can be used for effect size estimates.","Freedberg, Daniel E.; Messina, Megan; Lynch, Elissa; Tess, Monika; Miracle, Elizabeth; Chong, David H.; Wahab, Romina; Abrams, Julian A.; Wang, Harris H.; Munck, Christian",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314333/,665

As noted by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), animal health and welfare are inextricably linked. However, there is no international agreement to promote animal welfare and neither the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora nor the Convention on Biological Diversity, adequately address the welfare of the species they seek to conserve. While the OIE provides guidance on animal health and welfare standards for common agricultural species, it has provided limited guidance for the farming of wild species. China’s wildlife farming industry has been linked with the spread of COVID-19 but, to date, China has introduced few national welfare controls to protect the health of wild animals bred for human consumption. In the wake of COVID-19, these omissions must be remedied to provide appropriate safeguards to ensure animal health and welfare and protect public health.","Whitfort, Amanda",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7928851/,665

In an effort to understand and predict both the epidemic evolution and the impacts of this disease, we conceived models for multiple indicators: daily or cumulative confirmed cases, hospitalizations, hospitalizations with artificial ventilation, recoveries, and deaths. In spite of the limited data available when the lockdown was declared, we achieved good short-term performances at the national level with a classical CNN for hospitalizations, leading to its integration into a hospitalizations surveillance tool after the lockdown ended. Also, A Temporal Convolutional Network with quantile regression successfully predicted multiple COVID-19 indicators at the national level by using data available at different scales (worldwide, national, regional). The accuracy of the regional predictions was improved by using a hierarchical pre-training scheme, and an efficient parallel implementation allows for quick training of multiple regional models. The resulting set of models represent a powerful tool for short-term COVID-19 forecasting at different geographical scales, complementing the toolboxes used by health organizations in France.","Mohimont, Lucas; Chemchem, Amine; Alin, François; Krajecki, Michaël; Steffenel, Luiz Angelo",Appl Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8044508/,665
53995,Changes in Dietary Intake During COVID-19 Among Youth in Urban Communities: Insights From the COACHES Study,2021-06-07,"Assessment of autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning may be performed non-invasively using autonomic tests which are based on evaluation of response of cardiovascular system to the applied stimuli, such as increased air pressure during Valsalva maneuver, skeletal muscle contraction during static handgrip or deep slow breathing. The cardiovascular response depends, besides ANS reaction and test protocol, also on the way stimulus is self-applied by the test subject. We present a versatile device for controlling stimulus self-application during three ANS tests: Valsalva maneuver, static handgrip, and deep breathing. It integrates two different gauges and a pace setter for breathing into one device. The core of the device is a linear LED display which, using green, yellow, and red diodes, informs the subject about the correctness of self-application of respective stimulus. The settings of the device can be adjusted to the needs of the protocol chosen. The device can record the duration of mouth air pressure or the force produced by the subject during ANS tests, which assures correctness of the tests, thus allowing to track individual variability changes in the response to the test. The device was verified during ANS tests and its use was intuitive for patients, reducing the time needed for training before tests and decreasing the effort of the physician.","Żyliński, Marek; Niewiadomski, Wiktor; Cybulski, Gerard; Gąsiorowska, Anna",Med Devices (Auckl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8179790/,665

However, there are few comprehensive reviews and studies focusing on its evolution and reform. It is worthwhile to pay attention to the public health development in China, given that the history and structure of public health system have their own characteristics in China. METHODS The study is a retrospective review of the development public health over seven decades in China. It presents the findings from some national or provincial survey data, interviews with key informants, reviews of relevant published papers and policy contents. RESULTS This study identified four key stages that public health experienced in China: the initial stage centering on prevention, the stage of deviation with more attention to treatment but little to prevention, the recovery stage after SARS(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes) Crisis, and the new stage to an equitable and people-centered system. In the latest stage, the National Basic Public Health Service Program (NBPHSP) is implemented to respond the threat of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and has achieved some initial results, while there are still many challenges including service quality, poor integration among service items and IT system, lack of quality professionals and insufficient intersectoral endeavor. DISCUSSION There are unique Chinese wisdom and remarkable achievements as well as twists and turns on the development of China's public health. Prevention-first, flexible structure of the system, multi-agency collaboration and mass mobilization and society participation are the main experience of public health in early stage. Despite twists and turns since 1980s, public health system in China shows substantial resilience which may be from the government's continuous commitment to social development and people's livelihoods and its flexible governance. In 2010s, in order to achieve the well-off society, Chinese government pays unprecedented attention to health sector, which bring a new wave of opportunities to public health such as remaining the NBPHSP for priority. The evolution and reform of China's public health is based on its national condition, accumulates rich experience but also faces many common worldwide challenges. Getting this development and reform right is important to China's social and economic development in future, and China's experience in public health may provide many lessons for other countries. CONCLUSION Public health in China needs to focus on prevention, strengthen multi-agency coordination mechanism, improve the quality of public health services in the future.","Wang, Li; Wang, Zhihao; Ma, Qinglian; Fang, Guixia; Yang, Jinxia",Globalization and health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-019-0486-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31266514/,665

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends minimum daily intake of 1.5 cups of fruit and 2.5 cups of vegetables for females aged 14-18 years and 2 cups of fruit and 3 cups of vegetables for males aged 14-18 years.† Despite the benefits of fruit and vegetable consumption, few adolescents consume these recommended amounts (2-4). In 2013, only 8.5% of high school students met the recommendation for fruit consumption, and only 2.1% met the recommendation for vegetable consumption (2). To update the 2013 data, CDC analyzed data from the 2017 national and state Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBSs) to describe the percentage of students who met intake recommendations, overall and by sex, school grade, and race/ethnicity. The median frequencies of fruit and vegetable consumption nationally were 0.9 and 1.1 times per day, respectively. Nationally, 7.1% of students met USDA intake recommendations for fruits (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.0-10.3) and 2.0% for vegetables (upper 95% confidence limit = 7.9) using previously established scoring algorithms. State-specific estimates of the percentage of students meeting fruit intake recommendations ranged from 4.0% (Connecticut) to 9.3% (Louisiana), and the percentage meeting vegetable intake recommendations ranged from 0.6% (Kansas) to 3.7% (New Mexico). Additional efforts to expand the reach of existing school and community programs or to identify new effective strategies, such as social media approaches, might help address barriers and improve adolescent fruit and vegetable consumption.","Lange, Samantha J; Moore, Latetia V; Harris, Diane M; Merlo, Caitlin L; Lee, Seung Hee; Demissie, Zewditu; Galuska, Deborah A",MMWR.

RECENT FINDINGS Recent advances in AIS management by EVT have led to significant reduction in morbidity and mortality in selected patients with LVO within the anterior circulation. Until recently, use of EVT was strictly based on time criteria, within 4.5 to 12 h of symptom onset with many patients presenting with ""wake-up"" stroke who were not considered for EVT. The positive results of the DAWN and DEFUSE-3 trials have shown benefit in extending the therapeutic window for EVT to 24 and 16 h, respectively, after last known normal (LKN) time in the setting of large ischemic penumbra. These trials represent a paradigm shift in contemporary treatment of AIS, changing from a purely time-based decision to treat to an individualized decision based on clinical and radiographic findings of salvageable tissue. Overall, acute stroke management has evolved considerably over the years from intravenous thrombolysis to include EVT, with paralleled improvements in patient selection and thrombectomy devices. Since the results of the DAWN and DEFUSE-3, EVT is now considered the standard of care in select patients with anterior circulation LVO up to 24 h from LKN time. Despite these developments, post-stroke disability remains pervasive and further studies are warranted in establishing the role of EVT in posterior circulation and distal vessel occlusions, with need for development of new and effective techniques for revascularization of small vessels.","Hasan, Tasneem F; Todnem, Nathaniel; Gopal, Neethu; Miller, David A; Sandhu, Sukhwinder S; Huang, Josephine F; Tawk, Rabih G",Current cardiology reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11886-019-1217-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471811/,665
65677,What about the wait times Canada isn't tracking?,2020-09-14,"BACKGROUND Early gastric cancers are associated with lymph node metastasis (LNM) in 15% of cases. Risk factors for LNM are well established in Eastern countries. Less invasive treatments, such as endoscopic or surgical laparoscopic resection, are well accepted in Eastern countries and a matter of intense debate in the West, were indications for such treatments are still contested The objective of the study is to determine risk factors related to LNM and to validate endoscopic resection indications. METHODS The study was a retrospective cohort of 178 patients with early gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy. Clinical and pathological factors were analyzed. The new rules of ER from JGCA were applied to the studied cohort. RESULTS LNM was present in 13.48% of the cases, 3.96% (3/76) in T1a tumors and 20.58% (21/102) in T1b tumors. In univariate analysis ulceration (p = 0.04), differentiation grade (p = 0.04), submucosal invasion (p = 0.001), lymphatic invasion (p < 0.001), and vascular invasion (p < 0.001) were associated with LNM. In multivariate analysis, differentiation grade (p = 0.005) and submucosal invasion (p = 0.005) were independent risk factors. One patient classified in the expanded criteria group and seven from the relative criteria group had LNM. There were no LNM for undifferentiated mucosal lesions without ulceration. CONCLUSIONS Undifferentiated tumors and submucosal invasion are risks factors associated with LNM in early gastric cancer in our study.

66619,Optimizing care for critically ill older adults.,2021-10-04,"BACKGROUD Advanced airway management and endotracheal intubation (ETI) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is more difficult than, for example, during anesthesia. However, new devices such as video laryngoscopes should help in such circumstances. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of 4 intubation devices in pediatric manikin-simulated CPR. METHODS One hundred two paramedics participated in this study. None had prior experience in video laryngoscopy. After a standardized audiovisual lecture lasting 45 minutes, the paramedics participated in a practical demonstration using the advanced pediatric patient simulator PediaSIM CPR (FCAE HealthCare, Sarasota, FL), which was designed to be an accurate representation of a 6-year-old child. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed using LUCAS-2 (Physio-Contro, Redmond, WA). Afterward, paramedics were instructed to perform ETI using 4 intubation devices (MacGrathMAC, GlideScope, AirTraq, and Miller Laryngoscope Blade [Miller]) in a randomized sequence. The primary outcome was the success rate of tracheal intubation. The secondary outcome was the time to intubation. RESULTS The mean time to intubation was 30.7 ± 15.3, 28.6 ± 15.9, 24.1 ± 5.0, and 39.3 ± 14.7 seconds (McGrath, GlideScope, AirTraq, and Miller, respectively); and the success ratio of intubation for the devices was 100% vs 100% vs 100% vs 77.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Child ETI performed by paramedics during uninterrupted chest compression often has a low success rate. In contrast, McGrath, GlideScope, and AirTraq intubation devices are fast, safe, and easy to use. Within the limitations of a manikin study, this study suggests that inexperienced medical staff might benefit from using video laryngoscopy devices for child emergency airway management.","Szarpak, Lukasz; Karczewska, Katarzyna; Evrin, Togay; Kurowski, Andrzej; Czyzewski, Lukasz",The American journal of emergency medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2015.04.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25937380/,665

Both techniques were used on each head, alternating the left and right sides after random assignment to the first head. The heads were dissected to reveal the maxillary nerve and the length of nerve stained was measured. RESULTS There was no significant difference (p = 0.67) in the proportion of nerves stained for a length >6 mm by either technique (88.2% transorbital versus 82.3% percutaneous). The mean length of nerve stained did not differ significantly between the techniques (p = 0.26).

RESULTS Thirty-four patients had LSG, and none was lost to follow-up. Indications for LSG over other bariatric procedures were patient preference (n=28), severe obesity with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 60 kg/m(2) (n=5) and severe upper abdominal adhesions (n=1). All but 1 of the cohort were women, and the average age was 48 (standard deviation [SD] 11) years. Preoperatively, the average BMI was 50.3 (SD 7.7) kg/m(2). Preoperative obesity-related comorbidity rates were 56% (n=19) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 50% (n=17) for hypertension, 32% (n=11) for dys lipidemia, 62% (n=21) for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), 62% (n=21) for knee and/or hip pain and 44% (n=15) for depression and/or anxiety. The mean duration of surgery was 74 (SD 21) minutes. There were 2 major perioperative complications: 1 staple line leak and 1 staple line hemorrhage. The median stay in hospital was 1 day. Postoperative upper gastrointestinal imaging studies were conducted in 11 patients; 1 was positive for staple line leak. Histopathology on the excised gastric segments revealed chronic helicobacter pylori gastritis in 2 patients and small gastrointestinal stromal tumours in 1 patient. The mean postoperative follow-up interval was 10 months. Weight loss averaged 27.4 (SD 9.0) kg. Overall weight loss was 3.3 (SD 1.8) kg/month. Resolution occurred in 74% of patients with T2DM, 53% with hypertension, 45% with dyslipidemia, 76% with OSA, 38% with joint pain and 20% with depression/anxiety. Overall satisfaction was rated as excellent by 68% of patients, good by 29% and poor by 3% of patients. CONCLUSION Preliminary analysis of our experience with LSG indicates that this is an effective and safe procedure for the treatment of obesity.","Behrens, Carola; Tang, Bao Q; Amson, Bradley J",Canadian journal of surgery.

70929,More than 100 countries still not using global outbreak surveillance regulations.,2013,"BACKGROUND Mechanically assisted cough devices are used in patients with impaired cough to avoid secretion accumulation. We compared 5 mechanically assisted cough devices by bench testing using a breathing simulator and assessed their user-friendliness. METHODS We measured inspiratory and expiratory airway pressures and peak expiratory flow, the strongest indicator of cough efficacy. We performed 2 bench tests: 1) to ascertain the differences between preset and actual settings in 3 different machines of each mechanically assisted cough device and 2) to assess the effects of varying respiratory impedance and air leaks on performance of the devices. We also evaluated the user-friendliness of the devices by measuring the time required and errors in accomplishing 4 tasks by 10 physicians unfamiliar with mechanically assisted cough devices compared with product specialists from the distributing companies. Physicians also scored the ease of use. RESULTS Four mechanically assisted cough devices during insufflation and all 5 during exsufflation showed differences between preset and actual airway pressures. All but one device showed uneven actual pressure values between models of the same type. Peak expiratory flow was significantly influenced by the mechanical properties in 2 devices and by air leaks in 4 devices. The median time to accomplish all tasks by the product specialist (10 [interquartile range of 2-29] s) was overall significantly shorter compared with all physicians (from 19 [14-65] to 36 [19-116] s). The number of procedural errors, but not the perceived ease of use, differed significantly between the devices. CONCLUSIONS The performance of different mechanically assisted cough devices was erratic and included variance between models from the same manufacturer; it was affected by respiratory system impedance and air leaks. Time and rate of errors for performing procedures were elevated. These findings indicate that the devices are not interchangeable and that the settings should be targeted for each patient with the specific machine being used. Improvements in reliability, performance, and user-friendliness are advisable.","Frigerio, Pamela; Longhini, Federico; Sommariva, Maurizio; Stagni, Enrica G; Curto, Francesco; Redaelli, Tiziana; Ciboldi, Marco; Simonds, Anita K; Navalesi, Paolo",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.03809; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25944939/,665
71136,Should noninvasive ventilation be considered a high-risk procedure during an epidemic?,2009,"OBJECTIVES To analyze the clinical characteristics of 71 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS The general data, epidemiological data, laboratory tests, imaging examinations, and treatment of 71 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Sixth People's Hospital of Zhengzhou from January 19, 2020 to March 3, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS Of the 71 COVID-19 patients, the ages were 4-84 (41.29±15.21) years, 38 (53.5%) patients were male, 33 (46.5%) were female, and 52 (73.2%) were in 22 clusters. The main clinical manifestations were fever (78.9%), cough (64.8%), and sputum (38.0%). The fever was mainly low and moderate, with 49 patients (69.0%) at 37.3-39.0 ℃. Most of the leukocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes were normal, accounting for 47 (66.2%), 51 (71.8%), and 51 (71.8%) patients, respectively; a few of them were decreased, accounting for 21 (29.6%), 16 (22.5%), and 20 (28.2%) patients, respectively. There were 38 (53.5%) and 31 (43.7%) patients with the decreased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts, respectively. There were 41 (57.7%), 38 (53.5%), 32 (45.1%), 26(36.6%), 22 (31.0%), 20 (28.2%), 14 (19.7%), 14 (19.7%), and 9 (12.7%) patients with the increased levels of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, procalcitonin, fibrinogen,interleukin 6, lactate dehydrogenase,D-dimer,alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase, respectively. Of the 71 patients, the lung was involved in 60 (84.5%) patients, the double lung was involved in 47 (66.2%) patients, and the single lung was involved in 13 (18.3%) patients. The course of the disease was long, and the time from symptom onset to the second severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid negative transformation was (17.22±6.34) days.There were no significant differences in the incubation period (t=-0.453, P>0.05), the complicates (χ2=0.042, P>0.05), and the time from symptom onset to diagnosis (t=-1.330, P>0.05) in patients between the non-severe group and the severe group. The onset age, gender, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negative time, lymphocyte count, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, calcium ion, CD4+ T cell count, CD8+ T cell count, calcitonin, procalcitonin, and troponin were significantly different between the severe group and the non-severe group (all P<0.05). Among the 71 patients, 4 (5.6%) patients were mild, 59 (83.1%) were normal, and 8 (11.3%) were severe or critical. CONCLUSIONS The aggregation phenomenon of COVID-19 is obvious. Fever and cough are the main clinical manifestations. White blood cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes in the most patients in the early onset are normal. Most COVID-19 patients are light and ordinary type, with good prognosis.","Xiao, Miaomiao; Hou, Mingjie; Liu, Xuhui; Li, Zhe; Zhao, Qingxia",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

72514,How Canada can better embed randomized trials into clinical care.,2020-07-30,"We investigate the immediate social context of contraceptive behaviors: specifically, the intimate relationship. We use the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life (RDSL) study (2008-2012), based on a random sample of 1,003 women ages 18-19 residing in a Michigan county. Women were interviewed weekly for 2.5 years, resulting in an age range of 18-22. We test three sets of hypotheses about change over time within a relationship, using relationship-level within-between models, which compare a couple's contraceptive behaviors across different times in the relationship. First, we find that a couple is less likely to use contraception when the relationship is more intimate and/or committed and that a couple becomes less likely to use contraception over time, regardless of intimacy and commitment. Second, we find that a couple using contraception becomes increasingly likely to choose hormonal over coital methods, but this change occurs as a relationship endures and is unrelated to intimacy and/or commitment. Third, we find that a condom-using couple's consistency does not decline when there is conflict; rather, consistency of condom use declines over time regardless of the relationship's characteristics. We also demonstrate that conflict and power imbalance increase reliance on hormonal methods among those using contraception; conflict decreases consistency among withdrawal (but not condom) users; and nonmonogamy increases reliance on condoms and decreases withdrawal consistency. The strong and consistent link between duration and contraceptive behaviors-regardless of intimacy, commitment, conflict, or power imbalance-suggests that the continual vigilance required for long-term contraceptive use is difficult during early emerging adulthood.","Kusunoki, Yasamin; Barber, Jennifer S",Demography,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-020-00916-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901407/,665

In the present study we extended our work to clarify, in vivo, the role of type I IFN signalling on the circulating and lymphoid organs homing lymphocytes. METHODOLOGY Two groups of mice 13 in each were set: type I IFN signalling blocked mice injected with anti-IFNAR1 antagonist antibody (10 mg/kg body weight) once/day for up to 20 days, and control group were injected with vehicle alone. RESULTS Flow cytometry analysis to monitor the blood lymphocyte phenotype and proliferation have shown a significant decrease in CD45R/B220(+) [corrected] B cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in treated animals. Furthermore, the proliferative capacities of these lymphocyte subsets were significantly decreased in treated animals compared to those of control mice. Marked reduction in the plasma levels of IL-2 and IL-7 (cytokines important for the development of T and B cells) but not of IL-6 or IL-10 was observed in treated mice and this may a cause for emergence decrease in B and T cell numbers. Immunohistochemical studies have further shown a marked reduction in the numbers of CD20(+) B cells in spleen and Peyer's patches and CD3(+) T cells in thymus of treated animals. Moreover, electron microscopy examinations have revealed a loss of lymphocytes with characteristic features of apoptosis. CONCLUSION Our data confirmed that the in vivo inhibition of type I IFN signaling induce decrease in the numbers and defective functions of circulating and lymphoid organs homing lymphocytes providing a strong evidence for the protective effects of type 1 IFNs (IFN-α/β) on B and T lymphocytes.","Badr, Gamal; Waly, Hanan; Eldien, Heba M Saad; Abdel-Tawab, Hanem; Hassan, Khadega; Alhazza, Ibrahim M; Ebaid, Hossam; Alwasel, Saleh H","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",https://doi.org/10.1159/000323978; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21220934/,665
75133,"New coronavirus with ""pandemic potential"" sparks global surveillance efforts.",2013,"PURPOSE Despite the wide usage of World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II (WHODAS 2.0) in psychiatry research and clinical practice, there was limited knowledge on its proxy reliability among people with mental disorders. This paper aimed to compare the 12-item WHODAS 2.0 responses of adult patients with mental disorders to their family caregivers. METHODS In this study, 205 pairs of patients with mental disorders and primary family caregivers were consecutively recruited from one inpatient mental health department in a large hospital in China. All participants completed the 12-item version WHODAS 2.0 to assess patients' functioning in the 30 days prior to the hospitalization. Measurement invariance, including configural, metric and scalar invariance, was tested across patient and proxy groups, using multi-group confirmatory factor analysis. Agreement between patients and proxies was examined by paired Wilcoxon tests and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Subgroup analyses for proxy reliability were conducted within strata of proxy kinship and patient psychiatric diagnosis. RESULTS The 12-item WHODAS 2.0 achieved configural, metric and partial scalar invariance across patient and proxy groups. Unsatisfactory consistency was found for most items (ICC < 0.75, P < 0.05), especially for items on Cognition, Getting along, Life activities, and Participation in society (ICC < 0.4, P < 0.05). Spouses agreed with patients more often than parents (ICC ≥ 0.4, P < 0.05). The paired Wilcoxon tests found that impairment of patients with psychotic disorders tended to be overestimated by proxies while proxies tended to underestimate impairment of patients with mood disorders. CONCLUSION Our study reveals inconsistency between self and proxy reports in the 12-item WHODAS 2.0 among adult patients with mental disorders. When proxy reports is needed, spouses are preferred than parents. We should be aware of proxies' impairment overestimation among patients with psychotic disorders and underestimation among patients with mood disorders.","Zhou, Wei; Liu, Qian; Yu, Yu; Xiao, Shuiyuan; Chen, Lizhang; Khoshnood, Kaveh; Zheng, Shimin","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-020-02474-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388787/,665

SARS-CoV-2 has unique properties that place GPs at particular risk. OBJECTIVE The aim of this article is to discuss the nose-related features of SARS-CoV-2 that place GPs at risk, and to make recommendations pertinent to the safety and protection of primary healthcare physicians. DISCUSSION The highest viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is in the nose and nasopharynx. It is often highest early in the illness, before the development of symptoms. Further, SARS-CoV-2 replicates and continues to shed in the nasopharynx long after the virus is no longer detectable in the lower respiratory tract. This places any physician performing examinations on, or procedures involving, the upper respiratory tract at risk for contracting COVID-19. New-onset hyposmia and dysgeusia are indicators for COVID-19 and should be included in screening protocols.","Campbell, Raewyn G",Australian journal of general practice,https://doi.org/10.31128/ajgp-05-20-5452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33123703/,665

Although open surgical repair has been the standard approach to peripheral vascular injuries, endovascular treatment has become more refined and is now an alternative to open surgery, which potentially involves lower morbidity and mortality rates. However, management of arterial injuries, especially when they involve simple bleeding from small branches of the main artery, can be challenging, and the best treatment options for such injuries remains controversial. PATIENT CONCERNS Three cases suffered blunt trauma that resulted in hemorrhage from branches of the SFA. DIAGNOSIS All patients underwent selective angiography, which demonstrated active extravasation from branches of the SFA. INTERVENTIONS All patients were treated using embolization with n-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA). OUTCOMES A post-embolization angiography demonstrated successful hemostasis, with no complications. CONCLUSION Superselective catheterization using a coaxial technique with a 5-F curved catheter and the smallest caliber microcatheter, and using a permanent liquid embolic agent, such as NBCA, increases the success rate of embolization for cases of hemorrhage from SFA branches.","Oh, Chang Hoon; Kim, Yook; Lee, Jung Hwan; Kim, Hong Rye; Go, Seung Je",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629630/,665

With this method, we were able to run scenarios in real-time without interrupting clinical work. As well as allowing us to develop and refine procedures, these 'live simulations' provided staff training and highlighted system problems that needed to be addressed as the first wave of the pandemic approached.

83262,Good things come in threes (and sometimes fours): Update on renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and COVID-19.,2020-06-01,"Organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B induction is an evolving mechanism of drug disposition and interaction. However, there are contradictory reports describing OATP1B expression in hepatocytes and liver biopsies after administration of an inducer. This study investigated the in vivo effects of the common inducer rifampin (RIF) on the activity and expression of cynomolgus monkey OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters, which are structurally and functionally similar their human OATP1B counterparts. Multiple doses of oral RIF (15 mg/kg) resulted in a steady 3.9-fold increase of CYP3A biomarker, 4β-hydroxycholesterol (4βHC), in the plasma samples collected before each RIF dose during the treatment period (i.e., predose). In contrast, the predose plasma levels of OATP1B biomarkers coproporphyrin (CP) I and CPIII did not change when compared to RIF treatment. The trough concentration, AUC, and half-life of RIF decreased markedly during RIF treatment, suggesting that RIF induced its own clearance. Consequently, RIF treatment increased CPI and CPIII AUCs substantially after a single administration and, to a lesser extent, after multiple administrations, compared to pre-administration AUCs. In addition, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 mRNA expressions were not modulated by RIF treatment (0.85- to 1.3-fold) whereas CYP3A8 expression was increased 3.7- to 5.0-fold, which correlated well with the predose levels of CP and 4βHC. Rifampin treatment showed 2.0- to 3.3-fold increases in P-gp, BCRP, and MRP2 expression in the small intestine. Collectively, these findings indicate that monkey OATP1B and OATP1B3 are not induced by RIF and further investigation of OATP1B induction by RIF and other nuclear receptor activators in humans is warranted. Significance Statement In this study, combined endogenous biomarker and gene expression data suggested that RIF did not induce OATP1B in cynomolgus monkeys. For the first time, the study determines transporter gene expression in the nonhuman primate liver, gut, and kidney tissues following administration of RIF for 7 days, leading to a better understanding of the induction of OATP1B and other major drug transporters. Finally, it provides evidence to strengthen the claim that CP is a suitable endogenous probes of OATP1B activity.","Zhang, Yueping; Chen, Cliff; Chen, Shen-Jue; Chen, Xue-Qing; Shuster, David J; Puszczalo, Pawel D; Fancher, R Marcus; Yang, Zheng; Sinz, Michael; Shen, Hong",The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1124/jpet.120.000139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719071/,665

85779,Clearing the surgical backlog caused by COVID-19 in Ontario: a time series modelling study.,2020-09-01,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Although respiratory viruses are common triggers of asthma exacerbation, it is unknown whether this also applies to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, patients with asthma and allergy appear underrepresented in large reports of COVID-19 cases worldwide. In this review, we evaluate existing literature on this topic and potential underlying mechanisms for any interrelationship between asthma and COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS Data from several preclinical and clinical reports suggest a lower susceptibility for COVID-19 in patients with underlying type 2 airway inflammation including asthma that may be related to a reduced expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors for SARS-CoV-2. Corticosteroids further decrease expression of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors, hence may also have a protective effect against infection with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, some studies suggest that the reported improvement in asthma control and a reduction in asthma exacerbations during the COVID-19 pandemic may be related to improvement in adherence to controller therapy and reduced exposure to triggers, such as other respiratory viruses and air pollutants. Recent data point towards differential susceptibility for COVID-19 among asthma patients based on their phenotype and/or endotype. On the basis of existing evidence, continuation with controller therapies is recommended for all patients with asthma. For patients with severe uncontrolled asthma infected by SARS-CoV-2, adjustment of controllers and biologics should be based on a multidisciplinary decision. SUMMARY Underrepresentation of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with asthma and related allergic diseases may be based on potentially protective underlying mechanisms, such as type 2 airway inflammation, downregulation of ACE2/TMPRSS2 receptors, reduced exposures to triggers and improved adherence to controller medications. Although it is imperative that control should be maintained and asthma medications be continued in all patients, management of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma infected by SARS-CoV-2 including adjustment of controllers and biologics should be discussed on an individual basis.","Assaf, Sara M; Tarasevych, Svitlana P; Diamant, Zuzana; Hanania, Nicola A",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0000000000000744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33065601/,665

METHODS This was an Internet-based, cross-sectional study that collected information about socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, adherence to the Mediterranean diet and other dietary details, physical activity levels, and smoking habits using a self-administered questionnaire. The survey was conducted between April 6 and June 20, 2020, 1 to 2.5 mo after the initiation of the social confinement measures. RESULTS There were 1485 Cypriot adults who participated in the study. The median Mediterranean diet score was 21 (q1 = 19, q3 = 24) with men, married individuals, residents of rural regions, and physically active participants being more adherent to the Mediterranean diet compared with women; unmarried, divorced, or widowed; residents of urban regions; and physically inactive participants, respectively (P < 0.05). Multinomial logistic regression showed that being ≥45 y of age and physically active was positively associated with the Mediterranean diet score, whereas being unmarried, divorced, or widowed and a current smoker was negatively associated with the Mediterranean diet score (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Adherence to the Mediterranean diet during the confinement imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic among the Cypriot adult population was associated with male sex, age >45 y, being married, being physically active, and being resident of rural regions.

There are, however, no pediatric trials comparing it to flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy, the current accepted gold standard. This preliminary manikin study compares the first-attempt intubation success of the GlideScope Cobalt video laryngoscope to the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope when performed by attending pediatric anesthesiologists at two major pediatric centers. METHODS This prospective randomized, crossover study evaluated 120 attempts (60 with each study device) to intubate the AirSim Pierre Robin manikin (PRM) with fiberoptic bronchoscopy and video laryngoscopy (VL). Attending pediatric anesthesiologists from two quaternary pediatric centers were eligible to participate. Each attending anesthesiologist randomly performed a single tracheal intubation attempt with one of the study devices followed by the alternate method. The primary outcome was the first-attempt success rate of tracheal intubation. Blinding was not feasible. We hypothesized that first-attempt success would be higher with fiberoptic bronchoscopy. RESULTS Thirty anesthesiologists from each center were randomized to use one of the study devices followed by the alternate method. We analyzed all participants' data. There was no overall difference in first-attempt success between VL and fiberoptic bronchoscopy (88.3% vs 85% respectively, P = 0.59). There were significant institutional differences in first-attempt success using VL (76.7% vs 100%). CONCLUSIONS There was no difference in first-attempt success of tracheal intubation using VL vs fiberoptic bronchoscopy when performed by attending anesthesiologists at two large pediatric centers. However, institutional differences exist in success rates with VL across the two centers. Results from single-center device evaluations should be verified by multi-center evaluations. A significant proportion of attending anesthesiologists lack experience with advanced airway devices; targeted education may enhance intubation success and patient safety.","Fiadjoe, John E; Hirschfeld, Matthew; Wu, Stephan; Markley, James; Gurnaney, Harshad; Jawad, Abbas F; Stricker, Paul; Kilbaugh, Todd; Ross, Patrick; Kovatsis, Pete",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.12668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25917552/,665
94457,SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with spontaneous pneumothorax.,2020-04-21,"BACKGROUND To date, the majority of protein-based radiopharmaceuticals have been radiolabelled using non-site-specific conjugation methods, with little or no control to ensure retained protein function post-labelling. The incorporation of a hexahistidine sequence (His-tag) in a recombinant protein can be used to site-specifically radiolabel with 99mTc-tricarbonyl ([99mTc(CO)3]+). This chemistry has been made accessible via a technetium tricarbonyl kit; however, reports of radiolabelling efficiencies and specific activities have varied greatly from one protein to another. Here, we aim to optimise the technetium tricarbonyl radiolabelling method to produce consistently >95% radiolabelling efficiencies with high specific activities suitable for in vivo imaging. METHODS Four different recombinant His-tagged proteins (recombinant complement receptor 2 (rCR2) and three single chain antibodies, α-CD33 scFv, α-VCAM-1 scFv and α-PSMA scFv), were used to study the effect of kit volume, ionic strength, pH and temperature on radiolabelling of four proteins. RESULTS We used 260 and 350 μL [99mTc(CO)3]+ kits enabling us to radiolabel at higher [99mTc(CO)3]+ and protein concentrations in a smaller volume and thus increase the rate at which maximum labelling efficiency and specific activity were reached. We also demonstrated that increasing the ionic strength of the reaction medium by increasing [Na+] from 0.25 to 0.63 M significantly increases the rate at which all four proteins reach a >95% labelling efficiency by at least fourfold, as compared to the conventional IsoLink® kit (Covidien, Petten, The Netherlands) and 0.25 M [Na+]. CONCLUSION We have found optimised kit and protein radiolabelling conditions suitable for the reproducible, fast, efficient radiolabelling of proteins without the need for post-labelling purification.","Badar, Adam; Williams, Jennifer; de Rosales, Rafael Tm; Tavaré, Richard; Kampmeier, Florian; Blower, Philip J; Mullen, Gregory Ed",EJNMMI research,https://doi.org/10.1186/2191-219x-4-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24606843/,665

METHODS Between January 2001 and March 2005, 394 patients undergoing bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement were randomized to receive either the CE-SAV (n = 191) or the Mosaic (n = 203) prosthesis. The preoperative demographics, EuroSCORE and intraoperative characteristics concerning cardiopulmonary bypass of the 2 groups were comparable. All patients were followed annually for 10 years. RESULTS There were 77 (40.3%) deaths in the CE-SAV group and 93 (45.8%) deaths in the Mosaic group. The 10-year survival rate in the 2 groups was 59.7% and 54.2%, respectively (P = 0.27). There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of structural valve deterioration (P = 0.08), endocarditis (P = 0.95), thromboembolism (P = 0.06) and major bleeds (P = 0.09). However, the incidence of paravalvular leaks and valve-related reoperations were higher in the Mosaic group, with 5 leaks and 6 reoperations when compared to none in the CE-SAV group, (P = 0.02) and (P = 0.01) respectively. CONCLUSIONS At 10 years after implantation, freedom from reoperation was greater in the CE-SAV group with no incidences of paravalvular leaks.

98531,Living in pandemic times.,2020,"BACKGROUND Traditionally, infections are treated with antimicrobials (for example, antibiotics, antiseptics, etc), but antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become one of the most serious health threats of the 21st century (before the emergence of COVID-19). Wounds can be a source of infection by allowing unconstrained entry of microorganisms into the body, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. The development of new antimicrobials (particularly antibiotics) is not keeping pace with the evolution of resistant microorganisms and novel ways of addressing this problem are urgently required. One such initiative has been the development of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programmes, which educate healthcare workers, and control the prescribing and targeting of antimicrobials to reduce the likelihood of AMR. Of great importance has been the European Wound Management Association (EWMA) in supporting AMS by providing practical recommendations for optimising antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of wound infection. The use of wound dressings that use a physical sequestration and retention approach rather than antimicrobial agents to reduce bacterial burden offers a novel approach that supports AMS. Bacterial-binding by dressings and their physical removal, rather than active killing, minimises their damage and hence prevents the release of damaging endotoxins. AIM Our objective is to highlight AMS for the promotion of the judicious use of antimicrobials and to investigate how dialkylcarbamoyl chloride (DACC)-coated dressings can support AMS goals. METHOD MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Google Scholar were searched to identify published articles describing data relating to AMS, and the use of a variety of wound dressings in the prevention and/or treatment of wound infections. The evidence supporting alternative wound dressings that can reduce bioburden and prevent and/or treat wound infection in a manner that does not kill or damage the microorganisms (for example, by actively binding and removing intact microorganisms from wounds) were then narratively reviewed. RESULTS The evidence reviewed here demonstrates that using bacterial-binding wound dressings that act in a physical manner (for example, DACC-coated dressings) as an alternative approach to preventing and/or treating infection in both acute and hard-to-heal wounds does not exacerbate AMR and supports AMS. CONCLUSION Some wound dressings work via a mechanism that promotes the binding and physical uptake, sequestration and removal of intact microorganisms from the wound bed (for example, a wound dressing that uses DACC technology to successfully prevent/reduce infection). They provide a valuable tool that aligns with the requirements of AMS (for example, reducing the use of antimicrobials in wound treatment regimens) by effectively reducing wound bioburden without inducing/selecting for resistant bacteria.","Rippon, Mark G; Rogers, Alan A; Ousey, Karen",Journal of wound care,https://doi.org/10.12968/jowc.2021.30.4.284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33856907/,665
99243,Coagulopathy associated with COVID-19.,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic and control measures may have had an impact on unpleasant emotions experimented during the lockdown (LD). This may have increased the number of hours spent online and could have impacted the quality of the enacted behavior, in terms of loss of control of Internet use. In this online survey, we were interested in measure how much loss of control was perceived regarding online gambling, online shopping, the fruition of online pornographic content and web navigation. DESIGN AND METHODS The online survey was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic in the post-lockdown and 1232 subjects participated in the survey. In the participating sample, healthcare workers (HW) were 43.1% of the sample, of which 18.7% were directly involved in the Coronavirus emergency, and 52.3% of the sample is not a HW. Only 0.6% of the sample gambled online and 37.5% of those reported losing control of their gambling mode. Most of the sample shopped online during the LD (70.1%), but only 7.2% of those lost control by buying and/or spending more than what they had set themselves. RESULTS Significant data emerged showing that those who lost control while online shopping also lost control regarding the amount of time spent online (p<0.001); 21.6% of the sample, reported making use of online pornographic material during LD, 4.7% of them stated that the frequency increased and 5.1% reported losing control by having spent more money or more time than what was intended. Finally, 44.7% of the sample have experienced loss of control during the web navigation. Furthermore, during the LD 67.8% of the sample reports having experienced unpleasant emotions. Of these, 8.4% state that they enacted behaviors such as online gambling, online shopping, online pornographic material viewing and web navigation to counter their negative emotions. Interestingly, we found a correlation between loss of control during web navigation and online shopping and the emotional states ""upset"", ""scared"" and ""restless"" (p<0.05). CONCLUSION To conclude, there was no significant increase in potentially addictive behaviors, nor an increase in loss of control of these behaviors when enacted online. However, the loss of control in online shopping and web navigation was significantly correlated to the unpleasant emotional states of nervousness, fear and restlessness, whereas those who reported feeling strong and able to handle the situation experienced a lower loss of control in their web navigation. These correlations may suggest that these online behaviors may act as modulators of unpleasant emotional states.","Zamboni, Lorenzo; Carli, Silvia; Marika, Belleri; Giordano, Rosaria; Saretta, Giulia; Lugoboni, Fabio",Journal of public health research,https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2021.1959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33849257/,665
99345,"COVID-19: a cross-sectional study of suspected cases admitted to a federal hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and factors associated with hospital death.",2020,"Background Patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) have a particularly poor prognosis. And the treatment options for patients with relapsed or refractory ES-SCLC are limited. Thus, we conducted an open-label, multicenter, single-arm phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of apatinib plus etoposide capsules as the third- or further-line treatment in ES-SCLC patients. Methods Patients with ES-SCLC who experienced disease progression following 2 to 3 previous therapies from 11 medical centers in China were enrolled to receive apatinib (250 mg/d, continuously) and etoposide capsules (50 mg/d, on day 1-21, per 28 days). The treatment continued until disease progression, treatment intolerance, or death. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and safety. Results Fifty-six patients with relapsed or refractory ES-SCLC were enrolled from January 2018 to February 2020 and 53 of them were eventually included in the evaluation population. The median follow-up was 9.8 months. At the data cut-off time (March 5, 2020), 39 patients (74%) had died and 44 (83%) had progressed. The median PFS was 3.0 months (95% CI, 2.1-3.9) and the median OS was 5.0 months (95% CI, 3.6-6.4). No complete responses were seen. Eleven patients (21%) showed a best response of partial response and 37 (70%) patients achieved stable disease. The ORR was 20.8% (11/53), and the disease control rate (DCR) was 90.6% (48/53). The 6-month OS rate was 40.1% (95% CI, 26.2-54). After 12 months, the OS rate was 18.4% (95% CI, 4.7-32.1). Possible treatment-related grade III/IV adverse events included leukopenia [8 (15.1%)], neutropenia [7 (13.2%)], anemia [4 (7.4%)], and hand-foot syndrome [2 (3.8%)]. During the study, no mortality occurred as a consequence of treatment. Conclusions Apatinib combined with etoposide capsules exhibits efficacy and has an acceptable safety profile. It could be used as a later-line treatment for ES-SCLC patients who have been heavily pretreated with standard therapies. Further exploration of apatinib combined with etoposide capsules in phase III trials is warranted.","He, Zhen; Zhou, Hanqiong; Wang, Junsheng; Li, Ding; Zhang, Xudong; Wang, Pengyuan; Ma, Tianjiang; Zhang, Yueqiang; Tian, Chuntao; Chen, Yunfang; Zou, Minglei; Han, Yu; Xu, Cong; Ma, Shuxiang; Wang, Lili; Wu, Xuan; Chen, Gongbin; Wang, Qiming",Translational lung cancer research,https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-20-1235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33718030/,665
100775,Experiences of interaction between teenage mothers and visiting nurses: a phenomenological study.,2020,"Bacteria, biological colloids with wide presence in natural environments, would interact with plastic particles (emerging colloids with great concern recently) and thus would influence the fate and distribution of plastics in environment. In present research, the impacts of bacteria (both Gram (-) E. coli and Gram (+) B. subtilis) on the transport/deposition of model microplastics (MPs) in porous media were examined in NaCl salt solutions (5 and 25 mM, pH = 6). Both negative carboxylate-modified MPs (CMPs) and positive amine-modified MPs (AMPs) were concerned. We found that under both solution conditions, the presence of both types of bacteria decreased CMPs transport and enhanced retention of CMPs in sand columns. In contrast, the presence of bacteria (regardless of cell type) yet increased AMPs transport and decreased their deposition in sand columns under both ionic strength conditions. The mechanisms leading to the altered transport of CMPs and AMPs by bacteria were different. The formation of larger sized CMPs-bacteria clusters and the extra deposition sites resulted from bacteria adsorbed on quartz sand contributed to the decreased CMPs transport and enhanced their deposition in sand columns. Whereas, the formation of AMPs-bacteria clusters with overall negatively surface charge improved AMPs transport in quartz sand.","He, Lei; Rong, Haifeng; Li, Meng; Zhang, Mengya; Liu, Sirui; Yang, Meng; Tong, Meiping",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.125550; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740724/,665

104072,Highlights.,2016,"PURPOSE Imaging of the cardiac autonomic system with (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is useful in the evaluation of patients with a variety of cardiac conditions, including heart failure (HF), but few data are available about the reproducibility of this technique. We assessed the observer reproducibility of the results from a low-dose (123)I-MIBG cardiac imaging protocol in patients with HF. METHODS A total of 74 patients (62 men, age 67 ± 10 years) with HF and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 31 ± 7 %) underwent low-dose (111 MBq) planar and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (123)I-MIBG cardiac sympathetic imaging. The intraclass coefficient of correlation (ICC), Lin's concordance correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman analysis were used to evaluate the intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of early and late heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratios and of defect scores on SPECT images. The κ statistic was used to evaluate the concordance rates for the identification of patients with a low H/M ratio (<1.60) on late planar imaging. RESULTS The differences between measurements obtained twice by the same examiner and by two examiners were negligible for both early and late H/M ratios and for SPECT defect scores. These findings were confirmed by the results of Bland-Altman analysis, and ICC and Lin's coefficient values were excellent (>0.90) for all measurements. For the identification of patients with a low H/M ratio, the κ values were 0.90 for intraobserver concordance and 0.83 for interobserver concordance. CONCLUSION The present study showed a high observer reproducibility of planar H/M ratios and SPECT defect scores using a low-dose (123)I-MIBG cardiac imaging protocol in patients with HF.","Pellegrino, Teresa; Petretta, Mario; De Luca, Serena; Paolillo, Stefania; Boemio, Antonio; Carotenuto, Raffaella; Petretta, Maria Piera; di Nuzzo, Carmine; Perrone-Filardi, Pasquale; Cuocolo, Alberto",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-013-2461-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23740373/,665

Transanal Total Mesorectal Excision (taTME) is a new technique which seems to provide technical advantages. This study describes the results of taTME in a consecutive series of patients with low rectal cancer. METHODS From January 2012 to December 2013, a consecutive series of 26 patients with low rectal cancer underwent laparoscopic taTME with coloanal anastomosis. cT4 or Type II-III rectal cancer (according to Rullier's classification) were contraindications to taTME. After anal sleeve mucosectomy, the rectal wall was transected at the ano-rectal junction. A single-access multichannel port was inserted in the anal canal. taTME was performed from down to up until the sacral promontory posteriorly and the Pouch of Douglas anteriorly were reached. A laparoscopic trans-abdominal approach was used to complete the left colon mobilization. RESULTS Sixteen patients (61.5%) were male. The mean distance of the rectal cancer from the anal verge was 4.4 cm (range 3-6). Nineteen patients (73.1%) received long-course neoadjuvant radiotherapy. At final pathology, resection margins were negative in all the patients: the mean distal and radial resection margins were 19 mm and 11.2 mm, respectively. TME was complete in 23 patients (88.5%) and nearly complete in three. Postoperative mortality was 3.8%. The overall morbidity rate was 26.9% (7 patients): two patients (7.7%) had an anastomotic leakage (Dindo I-d). After a mean follow up of 23 months, no patients have developed a local recurrence.

This study was designed to prove our hypothesis that blocking the VEGF-Src signaling pathway by specific Src siRNA is able to prevent destructive repair in a SAON rabbit model. Destructive repair in SAON was induced in rabbits. At 2, 4, and 6 weeks after SAON induction, VEGF, anti-VEGF, Src siRNA, Src siRNA+VEGF, control siRNA, and saline were introduced via intramedullary injection into proximal femora for each group, respectively. Vascularization and permeability were quantified by dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. At week 6 after SAON induction, proximal femurs were dissected for micro-computed tomography (μCT)-based trabecular architecture with finite element analysis (FEA), μCT-based angiography, and histological analysis. Histological evaluation revealed that VEGF enhanced destructive repair, whereas anti-VEGF prevented destructive repair and Src siRNA and Src siRNA+VEGF prevented destructive repair and enhanced reparative osteogenesis. Findings of angiography and histomorphometry were consistent with those determined by DCE MRI. Src siRNA inhibited VEGF-mediated vascular hyperpermeability but preserved VEGF-induced neovascularization. Bone resorption was enhanced in the VEGF group and inhibited in the anti-VEGF, Src siRNA, Src siRNA+VEGF groups as determined by both 3D μCT and 2D histomorphometry. FEA showed higher estimated failure load in the Src siRNA and Src siRNA+VEGF groups when compared to the vehicle control group. Blockage of VEGF-Src signaling pathway by specific Src siRNA was able to prevent steroid-associated destructive repair while improving reconstructive repair in SAON, which might become a novel therapeutic strategy.","Zheng, Li-zhen; Cao, Hui-juan; Chen, Shi-hui; Tang, Tao; Fu, Wei-min; Huang, Le; Chow, Dick Ho Kiu; Wang, Yi-xiang; Griffith, James Francis; He, Wei; Zhou, Hong; Zhao, De-wei; Zhang, Ge; Wang, Xin-luan; Qin, Ling",Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,https://doi.org/10.1002/jbmr.2542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25917347/,665

CONCLUSION Patients with ESLD and/or ESRD who underwent TAVR had similar mortality at discharge and 30-days compared with patients without these comorbidities with a trend toward increased mortality at 1-year. This study suggests that TAVR is an option for aortic valve disease patients with ESRD and/or ESLD in order to remove cardiac barriers to liver or kidney transplant.","Caughron, Hope; Parikh, Devang; Allison, Zev; Deuse, Tobias; Mahadevan, Vaikom S",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.29559; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594809/,665

This qualitative study explored the impact of the pandemic on this population through the experiences and perceptions of social workers in hospice care. A survey was distributed through national and local listservs to social work practitioners throughout the United States between May 15 and June 15, 2020. The study was designed to learn the following: (1) Concerns patients experienced as a result of the pandemic, (2) strengths/resilience factors for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (3) the personal and professional impact of the pandemic on social workers. Themes uncovered in hospice care included isolation, barriers to communication, disruption of systems, issues related to grieving, family and community support, adaptation, and perspective. The authors provide recommendations for social work practice related to virtual communication, emergency planning, and evidence-based intervention for Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder. Recommendations for policy include uniform essential worker status for social workers, telehealth reimbursement and expanded caregiver respite benefits.","Gergerich, Erika; Mallonee, Jason; Gherardi, Stacy; Kale-Cheever, Megan; Duga, Frankie",Journal of social work in end-of-life & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1080/15524256.2020.1845907; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33226914/,665

This is initiated through multiple pathways and is finally aggravated by cross talks with cytokine storm and neutrophil, platelet, complement activation. All these combine towards the second week of illness to produce thrombosis in the lung capillaries surrounding the alveolus producing characteristic pulmonary dysfunction (PaO2/FiO2 > 300, normal or minimally increased lung compliance and very high d-dimer levels) and a high rate of peripheral venous thrombosis. International and many national guidelines have approached this state in different ways but all emphasized the need for management and prevention of widespread thrombosis. It is felt more aggressive and graded thrombosis prevention and management should be initiated early in the treatment. d-Dimer, neutrophil count, SaO2, fibrinogen levels should be used to control the hypercoagulability. Drugs like statins which have anti-inflammatory action as well as ability to reduce fibrinogen and other clotting factors should be used in the beginning along with antiplatelet drugs and progressively complement activation and neutrophil extracellular traps inhibitors, oral mucopolysaccharides, full-scale anticoagulation along with judicial use of fibrinolysis supporting drugs should be added. In the present review, we have evaluated the various studies and argued the rationality that the anticoagulation in this condition should be initiated early during the infection and should be increased in a graded manner depending on clinical and laboratory progression of the condition until a strong specific antiviral drug for coronavirus disease 2019 infection is available.","Ghosh, Kanjaksha; Ghosh, Malay",Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,https://doi.org/10.1097/mbc.0000000000000993; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827111/,665
113694,Should triage guidelines be revisited ahead of a second wave of COVID-19?,2020-06-22,"BACKGROUND Although the duodenal switch (DS) has been the most effective weight loss surgical procedure, it is a small minority of the total bariatric surgical cases performed. Modifications that can make the operation technically simpler and reduce a long-term risk of short bowel syndrome would be of benefit. The aim of this study was to detail our initial experience with a modified DS called stomach intestinal pylorus sparing (SIPS) procedure. METHODS Data from patients who underwent a primary SIPS procedure performed by two surgeons at two centers from January 2013 to August 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. All revisions of prior bariatric procedures were excluded. Regression analyses were performed for all follow-up weight loss data. RESULTS One hundred twenty-three patients were available. One hundred two patients were beyond 1 year postoperative, with data available for 64 (62 % followed up). The mean body mass index (BMI) was 49.4 kg/m(2). Two patients had diarrhea (1.6 %), four had abdominal hematoma (3.2 %), and one had a stricture (0.8 %) in the gastric sleeve. Two patients (1.6 %) were readmitted within 30 days. One patient (0.8 %) was reoperated due to an early postoperative ulcer. At 1 year, patients had an average change in BMI of 19 units (kg/m(2)), which was compared to an average of 38 % of total weight loss or 72 % of excess weight loss. CONCLUSIONS Modification of the classic DS to one with a single anastomosis and a longer common channel had effective weight loss results. Morbidity seems comparable to other stapling reconstructive procedures. Future analyses are needed to determine whether a SIPS procedure reduces the risk of future small bowel obstructions and micronutrient deficiencies.","Mitzman, Brian; Cottam, Daniel; Goriparthi, Richie; Cottam, Samuel; Zaveri, Hinali; Surve, Amit; Roslin, Mitchell S",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-016-2077-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26932811/,665

With the ADG currently under review, the purpose of this rapid review was to determine the environmental impacts associated with food consumption in Australia and New Zealand. RECENT FINDINGS Of the 20 articles included, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe) were the most common environmental indicator (n = 12), followed by water use and water footprint (n = 7), and carbon footprint (n = 3). Whilst there are commonalities between different environmental indicators such as the large impact of discretionary food consumption on GHGe, cropland scarcity footprint, and water scarcity footprint, there is wide variation in these indicators for other food groups. Furthermore, modelling of current food consumption data to the recommended diet does not necessarily result in improvement of all indicators. The next iteration of the ADG should promote consumption of foods and dietary patterns that are associated with positive health and environmental outcomes.","Forbes, Sara; Bicknell, Ellyn; Guilovica, Ligia; Wingrove, Kate; Charlton, Karen",Current nutrition reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13668-021-00374-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34625922/,665

However, few studies have been conducted on wide excision using various resurfacing methods. The objectives of this study were:One hundred forty-eight lesions were studied. All lesions were histopathologically confirmed as Bowen disease. Lesions were classified by anatomical site and treatment modality and their dimensions were measured. Punch biopsy was reperformed when a treated lesion was considered to have possibly recurred. Recurrence rates were then compared. Preoperative and intraoperative photos and follow-up images were also taken.The most common site of Bowen disease was the head and neck region. Wide excision was found to provide good outcomes with minimal tumor recurrence. Recurrence after cryotherapy occurred relatively quickly (mean 0.2 years, median 0.2 years) while recurrence after wide excision occurred at a mean 2.5 years. Treatment modality was significantly associated with recurrence (P < .05).The optimal treatment for Bowen disease has not been determined. Wide excision provided lower recurrence than other treatment modalities. Providers should be aware of the multiple treatment options available and select the method most appropriate for each patient.

117056,Protecting global health security through the International Health Regulations: requirements and challenges.,2008,"Understanding factors that affect the infectivity of SARS CoV-2 is central to combatting COVID-19. The virus surface spike protein of SARS CoV-2 mediates viral entry into cells by binding to the ACE2 receptor on epithelial cells and promoting fusion. We find that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) induces ACE2 expression when it enters the lytic replicative cycle in epithelial cells. By using VSV particles pseudotyped with the SARS CoV-2 spike protein, we show that lytic EBV replication enhances ACE2-dependent SARS CoV-2 pseudovirus entry. We find that the ACE2 promoter contains response elements for Zta, an EBV transcriptional activator that is essential for EBV entry into the lytic cycle of replication. Zta preferentially acts on methylated promoters, allowing it to reactivate epigenetically silenced EBV promoters from latency. By using promoter assays, we show that Zta directly activates methylated ACE2 promoters. Infection of normal oral keratinocytes with EBV leads to lytic replication in some of the infected cells, induces ACE2 expression and enhances SARS CoV-2 pseudovirus entry. These data suggest that subclinical EBV replication and lytic gene expression in epithelial cells, which is ubiquitous in the human population, may enhance the efficiency and extent of SARS CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells by transcriptionally activating ACE2 and increasing its cell surface expression.ImportanceSARS CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, has caused a pandemic leading to millions of infections and deaths worldwide. Identifying the factors governing susceptibility to SARS CoV-2 is important in order to develop strategies to prevent SARS CoV-2 infection. We show that Epstein-Barr virus, which infects and persists in >90% of adult humans, increases susceptibility of epithelial cells to infection by SARS CoV-2. EBV, when it reactivates from latency or infects epithelial cells, increases expression of ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS CoV-2, enhancing infection by SARS CoV-2. Inhibiting EBV replication with antivirals may therefore decrease susceptibility to SARS CoV-2 infection.","Verma, Dinesh; Mel Church, Trenton; Swaminathan, Sankar",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00192-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33853968/,665

The SAM treatment, particularly at the SAM functional group having lower surface energy, makes oxygen molecules difficult to be adsorbed onto IGZO. And such an effect much improves positive bias stability (PBS) and clockwise hysteresis stability to the same tendency. For NH2 and CF3 functional group SAMs with surface energies of 49.4 mJ/m2 and 23.5 mJ/m2, respectively, the IGZO TFT PBS was improved from 2.47 V to 0.32 V after the SAM treatment and the IGZO TFT clockwise hysteresis was also enhanced from 0.23 V to 0.11 V without any deterioration of TFT characteristics. Employing lower surface energy functional group to the SAM, of same head group and body group, does passivate and protect the IGZO backchannel region from oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. Consequently, the enhanced electrical stability of IGZO TFT can be achieved by the simple and economic SAM treatment.","Lee, Sung-Eun; Na, Hyunjae; Lee, Eun Goo; Park, Jintaek; Kim, Kyungho; Im, Changik; Park, Jun-Woo; Gong, Yong Jun; Kim, Youn Sang",Nanotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/abad5e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764196/,665
118221,Sam Meister.,2020-10-05,"Background. Dynamic arterial elastance (Ea dyn ), the relationship between pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV), has been suggested as a functional assessment of arterial load. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of arterial load changes during acute pharmacological changes, fluid administration, and haemorrhage on Ea dyn . Methods. Eighteen anaesthetized, mechanically ventilated New Zealand rabbits were studied. Arterial load changes were induced by phenylephrine ( n =9) or nitroprusside ( n =9). Thereafter, animals received a fluid bolus (10 ml kg -1 ), followed by stepwise bleeding (blood loss: 15 ml kg -1 ). The influence of arterial load and cardiac variables on PPV, SVV, and Ea dyn was analysed using a linear mixed-effects model analysis. Results. After phenylephrine infusion, mean ( sd ) Ea dyn decreased from 0.89 (0.14) to 0.49 (0.12), P <0.001; whereas after administration of nitroprusside, Ea dyn increased from 0.80 (0.23) to 1.28 (0.21), P <0.0001. Overall, the fluid bolus decreased Ea dyn [from 0.89 (0.44) to 0.73 (0.35); P <0.01], and haemorrhage increased it [from 0.78 (0.23) to 0.95 (0.26), P =0.03]. Both PPV and SVV were associated with similar arterial factors (effective arterial elastance, arterial compliance, and resistance) and heart rate. Furthermore, PPV was also related to the acceleration and peak velocity of aortic blood flow. Both arterial and cardiac factors contributed to the evolution of Ea dyn throughout the experiment. Conclusions. Acute modifications of arterial load induced significant changes on Ea dyn ; vasodilatation increased Ea dyn , whereas vasoconstriction decreased it. The Ea dyn was associated with both arterial load and cardiac factors, suggesting that Ea dyn should be more properly considered as a ventriculo-arterial coupling index.","Monge García, M I; Guijo González, P; Gracia Romero, M; Gil Cano, A; Rhodes, A; Grounds, R M; Cecconi, M",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aex070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28575332/,665
121273,Instructional design in the development of an online course on Basic Life Support.,2018,"Acquired inguinal herniation is a very common condition in stallions, usually leading to unilateral or bilateral castration to prevent future recurrence. Recently, several surgical techniques such as the standing laparoscopic peritoneal flap hernioplasty (SLPFH) have been developed to avoid herniation recurrence and also preserve the breeding activity of high economic value stallions. However, studies on SLPFH lack more comprehensive and systematic data about reproductive-related adverse effects and outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether SLPFH of the internal inguinal rings produces changes in the testicular blood flow in a 1-year follow-up. For that purpose, six healthy stallions were used and testicular blood flow was assessed before, 3, 6, and 12 months (T0, T3, T6, and T12) after the procedure. Blood flow was evaluated ultrasonographically, using the pulsed-wave color Doppler mode. Peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, the time-averaged maximum velocity, and the derived indexes (resistive index) and pulsatility index) of the testicular artery were measured in two localizations: in the spermatic cord and on the caudal epididymal edge of the testicle. On the spermatic cord, the peak systolic velocity of the testicular artery increased significantly at T12. However, on the epididymal edge location of the artery, the pulsatility and resistive indexes were decreased at T12 (P < 0.05). This pattern of blood flow was related to a hyperemic process. Furthermore, SLPFH might have compressed the spermatic cord, causing a slight occlusion of the testicular artery and triggering a compensatory hyperemia to compensate the deficit of blood flow that supplies the testes. The SLPFH of the internal inguinal ring affected the testicular perfusion in stallions in a 1 year follow-up, although there was no effect on sperm production during this time. The spectral Doppler ultrasound is a useful tool to asses the testicular perfusion after reproductive surgical procedure and provides information which anticipates vascular supply compromise of the stallion testicles.","Gracia-Calvo, L A; Duque, J; Balao da Silva, C; Ezquerra, J; Ortega-Ferrusola, C",Theriogenology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2015.05.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26116054/,665

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (N-3 PUFA) are suggested to enhance neuromuscular adaptations to exercise. METHODS We measured the neuromuscular adaptations to SIT (Study-1) and conducted a placebo-controlled randomized double blinded study to determine the effect of N-3 PUFA supplementation on neuromuscular adaptations to SIT (Study-2). In Study-1, seven active men (24.4 ± 2.6 years, VO2 peak 43.8 ± 8.7 ml kg min-1) completed 2-weeks of SIT with pre- and post-training 10 km cycling time trials (TT). In Study-2, 30 active men (24.5 ± 4.2 years, VO2 peak 41.0 ± 5.1 ml kg min-1) were randomly assigned to receive N-3 PUFA (2330 mg day-1) (n = 14) or olive oil (n = 16) during 2-weeks of SIT with pre- and post-training TTs. Four week post-training, a SIT session and TT were also performed. Change in neuromuscular function was assessed from resting twitches, quadriceps maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force, and potentiated twitch force (Q tw). RESULTS Study-1 showed that SIT did not elicit significant neuromuscular adaptations. Study-2 showed that N-3 PUFA supplementation had no significant effect on neuromuscular adaptations. Training caused lower MVC force [mean ± SD; N-3 PUFA -9 ± 11%, placebo -9 ± 13% (p < 0.05 time)] and Q tw peripheral fatigue [N-3 PUFA -10 ± 19%, placebo -14 ± 13% (p < 0.05 time)]. TT time was lower after training in all groups [Study-1 -10%, Study-2 N-3 PUFA -8%, placebo -12% (p < 0.05 time)]. CONCLUSION Two weeks of SIT improved TT performance in the absence of measurable neuromuscular adaptations. N-3 PUFA supplementation had no significant effect on SIT training adaptations.","Lewis, Evan J H; Stucky, Frédéric; Radonic, Peter W; Metherel, Adam H; Wolever, Thomas M S; Wells, Greg D",European journal of applied physiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-017-3539-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28160084/,665

METHODS Patients with stroke on treatment with a NOAC were prospectively enrolled in this multicentre observational study between February 2012 and 2015. Brain imaging at admission and follow-up imaging until day 7 were reviewed for HT. Functional outcome was assessed by the modified Rankin scale (mRS) before the index event, at discharge, and at 3-months. RESULTS 231 patients without recanalisation therapy (no-RT), and 32 patients with RT were eligible for analysis. Any HT was present at admission in 9/231 no-RT patients (3.9%, 95% CI 2.0 to 7.3) and in none of the patients with RT. In patients with follow-up imaging (no-RT, n=129, and RT, n=32), HT was present in 14.0% (no-RT; 95% CI, 8.9 to 21.1), and 40.6% (RT, 95% CI, 25.5 to 57.8), respectively. After adjustment for stroke severity, this difference between the no-RT and RT groups became non-significant. Symptomatic ICH was observed in 1 patient per group. HT was not associated with unfavourable outcome (mRS 3-6) at 3-months in multivariable analysis. Resumption of OAC after stroke was delayed in patients with HT compared to those without (15 d [IQR, 5-26] vs. 1 d [0-4], P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The frequency and severity of HT after stroke on NOAC appears similar to previous reports for vitamin K antagonists and no anticoagulation. Whether asymptomatic HT should delay resumption of preventive anticoagulation requires further investigation.","Purrucker, Jan C; Haas, Kirsten; Wolf, Marcel; Rizos, Timolaos; Khan, Shujah; Kraft, Peter; Poli, Sven; Dziewas, Rainer; Meyne, Johannes; Palm, Frederick; Jander, Sebastian; Möhlenbruch, Markus; Heuschmann, Peter U; Veltkamp, Roland",Journal of stroke,https://doi.org/10.5853/jos.2016.00542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28178406/,665

PED, caused by the PED virus (PEDV), leads to severe diarrhea, vomiting, and subsequent dehydration in suckling piglets. Lactogenic immunity derived from colostrum and milk is very important because immunoglobulins (Ig) cannot cross the placenta in pregnant sows. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunological correlation of the sample-to-positive (S/P) ratios of IgA and IgG against PEDV between colostrum, sow serum, and their piglet serum. Materials and Methods A total of 43 sows were divided into three groups according to the experience of PEDV infection: Negative sow group (n=7) and treatment group (n=36, sows previously infected with PEDV). The treatment group was subdivided into two groups: Sows immunized with live-attenuated PEDV vaccine (n=15) and sows immunized with feedback (n=21) at 3 weeks before farrowing. The 7-day-old piglets (n=425) were obtained from negative sows (n=89), vaccinated sows (n=150), and feedback sows (n=275). Colostrum, sow serum, and their piglet serum were collected and analyzed for S/P ratios of their IgA and IgG levels against PEDV using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results The piglets from sows immunized with live-attenuated PEDV vaccine had a higher S/P ratio of IgG against PEDV (p<0.001), whereas the piglets from the feedback group had a higher S/P ratio of IgA against PEDV (p<0.001) compared with piglets from the negative sows. In addition, the S/P ratios of PEDV-specific IgA and IgG between sow serum and colostrum showed a positive correlation (Pearson's coefficient r=0.61 and 0.75, respectively). Both S/P ratios of PEDV-specific IgA and IgG in sow serum and colostrum had a positive correlation to those in piglet serum. Conclusion Overall, this study suggested that pregnant sows immunized with the live-attenuated vaccine against PEDV and feedback may provide maternal immunity against PEDV to their offspring.","Boonsoongnern, Prapassorn; Boodde, Orawan; Chumsing, Wilairat; Sukmak, Manakorn; Jirawattanapong, Pichai; Ratanavanichrojn, Nattavut; Boonsoongnern, Alongkot",Veterinary world,https://doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2021.1689-1694; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34316220/,665

Seeing the digital as productive of citizenship, rather than facilitative of it, this paper unpacks the contested role of technology in acts of digital health citizenship. Drawing on longitudinal data collected in the English healthcare context, this article shows that digital health citizenship is produced through patients' involvement in the generation of health knowledge, including 'big' health data, digital artefacts, experiential knowledge and service feedback. The paper adds to existing literature by disaggregating the contested role of technology in displays of digital health citizenship, showing that digital health technology can give rise to expressions of altruism, belonging, and demands for recognition and change in healthcare, whilst responsibilising citizens for the care of themselves and others. The discussion shows how, rather than merely facilitating the actions of a free and autonomous subject, this citizenship often becomes algorithmically produced (e.g. through nudges) and remains isolated to separate instances of engagement without a long-term orientation. Our study enriches the growing sociological literature on health citizenship by exploring how digital technology produces health citizenship at the intersection of biosociality and technosociality.","Petrakaki, Dimitra; Hilberg, Eva; Waring, Justin",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33434718/,665

Pre-existing cellular immunity to DENV is thought to contribute to protection in subsequent ZIKV infection, but the epitope targets of cross-reactive T cell responses have not been comprehensively identified. Using human blood samples from the DENV-endemic regions of Nicaragua and Sri Lanka that were collected before the global spread of ZIKV in 2016, we employed an in vitro expansion strategy to map ZIKV T cell epitopes in ZIKV-unexposed, DENV-seropositive donors. We identified 93 epitopes across the ZIKV proteome, and we observed patterns of immunodominance that were dependent on antigen size and sequence identity to DENV. We confirmed the immunogenicity of these epitopes through a computational HLA binding analysis, and we showed that cross-reactive T cells specifically recognize ZIKV peptides homologous to DENV sequences. We also found that these CD4 responses were derived from the memory T cell compartment. These data have implications for understanding the dynamics of flavivirus-specific T cell immunity in endemic areas.ImportanceMultiple flaviviruses, including Zika (ZIKV) and the four serotypes of dengue (DENV) viruses, are prevalent in the same large tropical and equatorial areas inhabited by hundreds of millions of people. The interplay of DENV and ZIKV infection is especially relevant, as these two viruses are endemic in largely overlapping regions, have significant sequence similarity, and share the same arthropod vector. Here, we define the targets of pre-existing immunity to ZIKV in unexposed subjects collected in dengue-endemic areas. We demonstrate that pre-existing immunity to DENV could shape ZIKV-specific responses, and DENV-ZIKV cross-reactive T cells can be expanded by stimulation with ZIKV peptides. The issue of potential ZIKV and DENV cross-reactivity is of relevance for understanding patterns of natural immunity, as well as for the development of diagnostic tests and vaccines.","Schouest, Blake; Grifoni, Alba; Pham, John; Mateus, Jose; Sydney, John; Brien, James D; De Silva, Aruna D; Balmaseda, Angel; Harris, Eva; Sette, Alessandro; Weiskopf, Daniela",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00132-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33789994/,665

Early identification of later converters is crucial for optimal treatment decisions. The purpose of this study was to assess the predictive potential of OCT measures in individuals with RIS regarding conversion to MS. METHODS This prospective observational cohort study included 36 individuals with RIS and 36 healthy controls (HC) recruited from two German MS centers. All individuals received a baseline OCT and clinical examination and were longitudinally followed over up to six years. The primary outcome measure was the conversion to MS. RESULTS During clinical follow-up of 46 (26-58) months (median, 25%-75% interquartile range), eight individuals with RIS converted to MS. Individuals converting to MS showed a thinning of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) and the common ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer (GCIP) at baseline and during follow-up. Individuals with a pRNFL of 99 µm or lower or a GCIP of 1.99 mm3 or lower were at a 7.5 and 8.0-fold risk for MS conversion, respectively, compared to individuals with higher measures. After correction for other known risk factors, Cox proportional hazards regression revealed a hazard ratio of 1.08 for conversion to MS for each 1 µm decline in pRNFL. CONCLUSIONS Reduction of the pRNFL might be a novel and independent risk factor for conversion to MS in individuals with RIS. OCT might be useful for risk stratification and therapeutic decision-making in individuals with RIS.","Aly, Lilian; Havla, Joachim; Lepennetier, Gildas; Andlauer, Till F M; Sie, Christopher; Strauß, Eva-Maria; Hoshi, Muna-Miriam; Kümpfel, Tania; Hiltensperger, Michael; Mitsdoerffer, Meike; Mühlau, Mark; Zimmer, Claus; Hemmer, Bernhard; Korn, Thomas; Knier, Benjamin",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32589804/,665
130360,Asthma and COVID-19.,2020-04-24,"OBJECTIVES There are limited clinical data on feasibility and safety of convalescent plasma therapy in kidney transplant recipients with severe COVID-19. The present study was conducted to explore the feasibility of convalescent plasma treatment in 10 kidney transplant recipients with severe COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS The prospective observational cohort study was conducted at the Institute of Kidney Disease and Research Centre, Ahmedabad, India. All patients were admitted to the intensive care unit and received antiviral therapy, glucocorticoids, and other supportive care. Two doses of 200 mL each of convalescent plasma with neutralization activity of >1:640 were transfused into patients 24 hours apart following the World Health Organization blood transfusion protocol. The endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 1 day and 7 days after convalescent plasma transfusion. RESULTS The patients showed resolution of clinical symptoms, and there was a significant decrease in inflammatory markers (P < .05) within 7 days of convalescent plasma transfusion. Of the 10 patients, 9 patients had full recovery and 1 patient died. CONCLUSIONS Convalescent plasma therapy is highly safe and clinically feasible and reduces mortality in kidney transplant recipients with severe COVID-19. Larger clinical registries and randomized clinical trials should be conducted to further explore the clinical outcomes associated with convalescent plasma use in kidney transplant recipients with severe COVID-19.","Gupta, Akash; Kute, Vivek B; Patel, Himanshu V; Engineer, Divyesh P; Banerjee, Subho; Modi, Pranjal R; Rizvi, Syed J; Mishra, Vineet V; Patel, Ansy H; Navadiya, Vijay",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.6002/ect.2020.0479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33605203/,665

131270,"Virtual care is here to stay, but major challenges remain.",2020-07-27,"This study proposes a technology conceived based on an integrative approach that aims to promote phosphorus recovery and to recycle ferric water treatment sludge (FWTS), using it as a phosphorus adsorbent which may be applied as a soil ameliorant after reaching saturation. The assessed pilot plant operated with a daily influent flow of 360 litres and presented a removal efficiency of 94.4% ± 3.2% for chemical oxygen demand (COD) and of 91.2% ± 7.8% for suspended solids. It also presented promising results for phosphorus removal. The maximum efficiency of dissolved reactive phosphorus removal was 95% on the first day and it decreased until reaching adsorbent saturation. The estimated breakthrough time was one year in the condition in which the filling medium of a second constructed wetland was only FWTS. In this situation, the effluent phosphorus concentration was 0.2 mg·L-1. The authors concluded that the application of FWTS in a constructed wetland bed is an interesting alternative. Batch adsorption experiments were run using phosphorus stock solution. Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherm models were obtained for different initial pH values. The maximum adsorption capacity decreased as the initial pH was increased; values ranged from 4.76 mg P·g-1 (pH = 3.9) to 1.44 mg P·g-1 (pH = 9.0).","Chaves, Vitor Tonzar; Morita, Dione Mari; Chao, Iara Regina Soares; Contrera, Ronan Cleber",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2019.332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31746791/,665

METHODS Four commonly used surgical meshes were tested in this study, including Parietex, SoftMesh, TIGR, and Strattice. One-square-centimeter pieces of each mesh were placed on top of a monolayer of human fibroblasts or rat MSCs. The coating status was monitored with a light microscope. The human promonocytic cell line U937 was induced to differentiate into macrophages (MΦ). Three weeks later, meshes were transferred to new 24-well plates and cocultured with the MΦs for 72 h. Culture medium was collected and analyzed for IL-1β, IL-6, and VEGF production using standard ELISA essays. Parallel mesh samples were fixed with paraformaldehyde or glutaraldehyde for histology or transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) analyses, respectively. RESULTS Uncoated meshes induced increased production of all three cytokines compared with macrophages cultured alone. HF coating further increased the production of both IL-6 and VEGF but reduced IL-1β production. Except for the SoftMesh group, MSC coating significantly blunted release of all cytokines to levels even lower than with MΦs cultured alone. MΦs tended to deteriorate in the presence of MSCs. Both histology and TEM revealed intimate interactions between cell-coated meshes and MΦs. CONCLUSIONS Cytokine response to fibroblast coating varied, while MSC coating blunted the immunogenic effect of both synthetic and biologic meshes in vitro. Cell coating appears to affect mesh biocompatibility and may become a key process in mesh evolution.","Gao, Yue; Krpata, David M; Criss, Cory N; Liu, Lijia; Posielski, Natasza; Rosen, Michael J; Novitsky, Yuri W",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3470-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24972922/,665
131649,"MERS differs from SARS, say experts.",2014,"Wafer-scale nanoribbon field-effect transistor (FET) biosensors fabricated by straightforward top-down processes are demonstrated as sensing platforms with high sensitivity to a broad range of biological targets. Nanoribbons with 350 nm widths (700 nm pitch) were patterned by chemical lift-off lithography using high-throughput, low-cost commercial digital versatile disks (DVDs) as masters. Lift-off lithography was also used to pattern ribbons with 2 μm or 20 μm widths (4 or 40 μm pitches, respectively) using masters fabricated by photolithography. For all widths, highly aligned, quasi-one-dimensional (1D) ribbon arrays were produced over centimeter length scales by sputtering to deposit 20 nm thin-film In2O3 as the semiconductor. Compared to 20 μm wide microribbons, FET sensors with 350 nm wide nanoribbons showed higher sensitivity to pH over a broad range (pH 5 to 10). Nanoribbon FETs functionalized with a serotonin-specific aptamer demonstrated larger responses to equimolar serotonin in high ionic strength buffer than those of microribbon FETs. Field-effect transistors with 350 nm wide nanoribbons functionalized with single-stranded DNA showed greater sensitivity to detecting complementary DNA hybridization vs 20 μm microribbon FETs. In all, we illustrate facile fabrication and use of large-area, uniform In2O3 nanoribbon FETs for ion, small-molecule, and oligonucleotide detection where higher surface-to-volume ratios translate to better detection sensitivities.","Zhao, Chuanzhen; Liu, Qingzhou; Cheung, Kevin M; Liu, Wenfei; Yang, Qing; Xu, Xiaobin; Man, Tianxing; Weiss, Paul S; Zhou, Chongwu; Andrews, Anne M",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c07503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33337135/,665

Considering multi-organ disabilities, a comprehensive rehabilitation provided in sub-acute phase could be considered a suitable setting for these patients. AIM Objective of this article is to report the features and rehabilitative outcomes of patients requiring rehabilitation due to disabilities related to severe Covid -19 infection. DESIGN Longitudinal Observational Study. SETTING Rehabilitation Department in General Hospital. POPULATION Patients showing multiple disabilities due to severe Covid 19 infection. METHODS 39 consecutive patients were admitted to a rehabilitation ward transferred from ICU or Medical wards. Barthel Index and Functional Ambulation Categories were scored as disabilities measures. Data regarding comorbidity, rehabilitation course; swabs; procedures in acute phase; nonrespiratory manifestations; dysphagia, mental confusion; PaO2/FiO2; oxygen supplementation have been collected to admission and discharge. For all patients a comprehensive rehabilitation treatment, have been provided. RESULTS Functional outcome is good with a statistical significant improvements in BI and FAC scores. 38 were discharged at their home. Mean LOS in acute wards was 46 days. Mean LOS in rehabilitation was 20 day. 11 patients still had tracheostomy at admission, none at discharge and all dysphagic patients recovered a normal oral feeding. The change in PaO2/FiO2 and the reduction of the oxygen supplementation testify a good recovery of pulmonary function. CONCLUSIONS Our results show a consistent recovery with little caregiver burden at discharge. Fast relocation from ICU makes beds available which are very valuable during pandemic. Comprehensive rehabilitation treatment provided in sub-acute phase for patients still positive for SARS-CoV-2, would be desiderable as it seem to be an effective setting. In this setting a strong medical assistance must be ensured. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT The activation of comprehensive rehabilitation settings able to assist sub acute patients still positive would be desirable as it could be a very efficient Healthcare Systems answer to the catastrophic pandemic, decompressing acute hospital as well.

As one of the most aerosol-generating occupations, dentists are at high risk and are recommended to treat emergency cases only. We aimed to assess the general knowledge, emergencies, personal precautions, and avoided behaviors among the orthodontists and also their anxiety levels, during COVID-19. Methods A survey research, including demographic information, general knowledge about COVID-19, treatment strategies, protective measures, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) 7 test, was conducted via a web-based questionnaire (1 open-ended and 26 closed-ended questions). A total of 215 orthodontists older than 20 years of age and practicing in different regions of Turkey were included in this study. The answers received within the first 10 days were included. Results Most of the orthodontists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and transmission routes (n=159 and n=183, respectively). Almost all of them treated only emergency cases (n=209). Orthodontic emergencies were reported mostly as injury due to band/bracket failure, soft/hard tissue trauma, and problems in retention appliances (n=197, n=186, and n=81, respectively). The participants also avoided aerosol-generating procedures and used transmission-based protective equipment. The prevalence of GAD was 16.7% during COVID-19, and there was no statistically significant difference when it was stratified by gender, age, city, and COVID-19 related questions (p>0.05).

134066,Projecting demand for critical care beds during COVID-19 outbreaks in Canada.,2020-04-08,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW This review considers the potential and demonstrated impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on the sexually transmissible infection (STI)/HIV transmission. RECENT FINDINGS COVID-19 increases the vulnerability of those at highest risk of acquiring STI/HIV. Altered health-seeking behaviour, reductions in STI/HIV clinic capacity, service disruptions and redeployment of human resources to assist COVID-19 control efforts have impacted on STI/HIV control programmes. Reports of reduced STI incidence are emerging, but it is hard to determine whether this is real or due to decreased testing during COVID-19 lockdown periods. Fear of COVID-19 and implemented control measures have altered STI/HIV transmission dynamics. Sexual health services adapted to the pandemic by reducing face-to-face patient encounters in favour of telehealth and mail-based initiatives as well as more stringent triage practice. Many sexual health and HIV treatment services now operate at reduced capacity and experience ongoing service disruptions, which necessarily translates into poorer outcomes for patients and their communities. SUMMARY In the short-term, COVID-19 related sexual behaviour change is driving STI/HIV transmission downwards. However, the impacts of the global COVID-19 response on sexual health-seeking behaviour and STI/HIV services threaten to drive STI/HIV transmission upwards. Ultimately, the expected rebound in STI/HIV incidence will require an appropriate and timely public health response.

134597,Health geography: supporting public health policy and planning.,2008,"The only definitive therapy for end stage heart failure is orthotopic heart transplantation. Each year, it is estimated that more than 100,000 donor hearts are needed for cardiac transplantation procedures in the United States1-2. Due to the limited numbers of donors, only approximately 2,400 transplants are performed each year in the U.S.2. Numerous approaches, from cell therapy studies to implantation of mechanical assist devices, have been undertaken, either alone or in combination, in an attempt to coax the heart to repair itself or to rest the failing heart3. In spite of these efforts, ventricular assist devices are still largely used for the purpose of bridging to transplantation and the utility of cell therapies, while they hold some curative promise, is still limited to clinical trials. Additionally, direct xenotransplantation has been attempted but success has been limited due to immune rejection. Clearly, another strategy is required to produce additional organs for transplantation and, ideally, these organs would be autologous so as to avoid the complications associated with rejection and lifetime immunosuppression. Decellularization is a process of removing resident cells from tissues to expose the native extracellular matrix (ECM) or scaffold. Perfusion decellularization offers complete preservation of the three dimensional structure of the tissue, while leaving the bulk of the mechanical properties of the tissue intact4. These scaffolds can be utilized for repopulation with healthy cells to generate research models and, possibly, much needed organs for transplantation. We have exposed the scaffolds from neonatal mice (P3), known to retain remarkable cardiac regenerative capabilities,5-8 to detergent mediated decellularization and we repopulated these scaffolds with murine cardiac cells. These studies support the feasibility of engineering a neonatal heart construct. They further allow for the investigation as to whether the ECM of early postnatal hearts may harbor cues that will result in improved recellularization strategies.","Garry, Mary G; Kren, Stefan M; Garry, Daniel J",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/54459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27842351/,665

METHODS A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted through WeChat from March 13 to 15, 2020, which included a general data questionnaire and Conners parental assessment questionnaire (PSQ). The questionnaires received from outside of Hubei province were excluded through IP address, and the questionnaires with answer time <150 s were also excluded. The influence of parental work status on the psychological behavior was analyzed in children of different age groups. RESULTS A total of 391 valid questionnaires were collected, there were 207 males (52.9%) and 184 females (47.1%); 91 (23.3%) aged 3 to 6, 183 (46.8%) aged 6 to 10, and 117 (29.9%) aged 10 to 16. Both parents were medical staff in 87 participants(22.3%), one parent was medical staff in 139(35.5%) participants, and no parents were medical staff in 165 (42.2%) participants. In 3-<6 years group, there was no significant difference in the PSQ scores of the children in each factor level (all P>0.05) between children with parents as medical staff and those without. In 6-<10 years group, children with both parents as medical staff had higher hyperactivity-impulse factor score, learning problem factor score and total score than those without parents as medical staff (all P<0.05), while they had higher learning problem factor score than those with one parent as medical staff (P<0.05); the anxiety score of children with one or both parents as medical staff was higher than that of those without parents as medical staff (all P<0.05). In 10 to 16 years group, the behavior problems, learning problems, hyperactivity-impulse, more dynamic index and the total score in children with one parent as medical staff were lower than those with both parents as medical staff or without parents as medical staff (P<0.05 or P<0.01); while there were no significant differences in psychosomatic problems, anxiety factor scores between children with one parent as medical staff and other two groups (all P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS s During COVID-19 epidemic period, the psychological and behavior status of minor children of Hubei medical staff with different ages shows differences with those without parents as medical staff, particularly in 6-<10 years and 10 to 16 year groups.

The term ""pandemic"" is defined as ""an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people"". The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has not been seen since the outbreak of Human Immunodeficiency Virus in the early eighties. But there is another unseen pandemic running alongside the current COVID-19 pandemic, which affects a vast number of people, crossing international boundaries and occurring in every single country worldwide. The pandemic of traumatic injuries. Traumatic injuries account for 11% of the current Global Burden of Disease, resulting in nearly 5 million deaths annually and is the third-leading cause of death worldwide. For every trauma-related death, it is estimated that up to 50 people sustain permanent or temporary disabilities. Furthermore, traumatic injuries occur at disproportionately higher rates in low- and middle-income countries, with approximately 90% of injuries and more than 90% of global deaths from injury occurring these countries. Injuries are increasing worldwide, crossing international boundaries and affecting a large number of people, in the same manner Human Immunodeficiency Virus did in the 1980's and COVID-19 is today. The tremendous global effort to tackle the COVID-19 and Human Immunodeficiency Virus pandemics has occurred whilst ignoring the comparable pandemic of injury.

Despite efforts by the healthcare sector to develop health system solutions to improve transitions, problems persist. Research on transitional support has predominantly focused on services delivered by healthcare professionals; the evidence for services provided by lay navigators or volunteers in this context has not been synthesised. This scoping review will map the available literature on the engagement of volunteers within third sector organisations supporting adults in the transition from hospital to home. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Using the well-established scoping review methodology outlined by the Joanna Briggs Institute, a five-stage review is outlined: (1) determining the research question, (2) search strategy, (3) inclusion criteria, (4) data extraction and (5) analysis and presentation of the results. The search strategy will be applied to 10 databases reflecting empirical and grey literature. A two-stage screening process will be used to determine eligibility of articles. To be included in the review, articles must describe a community-based programme delivered by a third sector organisation that engages volunteers in the provisions of services that support adults transitioning from hospital to home. All articles will be independently assessed for eligibility, and data from eligible articles will be extracted and charted using a standardised form. Extracted data will be analysed using narrative and descriptive analyses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is not required for this scoping review. Members of an international special interest group focused on the voluntary sector will be consulted to provide insight and feedback on study findings, help with dissemination of the results and engage in the development of future research proposals. Dissemination activities will include peer-reviewed publications and academic presentations.","Nelson, Michelle LA; Armas, Alana; Thombs, Rachel; Singh, Hardeep; Fulton, Joseph; Cunningham, Heather V; Munce, Sarah; Hitzig, Sander; Bettger, Janet Prvu",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34226235/,665

139405,Should health workers confront patients who they suspect of abusing their partners?,2020-08-17,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic conditions that result from uncontrolled intestinal inflammation. Pathogenic Th17 cells, characterised by production of IL-17A in the absence of IL-10, are thought to contribute to this inflammation, but in humans, antibody-mediated blockade of IL-17A is an ineffective IBD therapy whereas IL-23 blockade is effective. Here, we investigated the effects of pharmacological inhibition of RORC2, the Th17 cell lineage-defining transcription factor, on in vivo-differentiated human Th17 cells and Th17-like regulatory T cells (Th17-Tregs). BMS-336, a small molecule RORC2 inverse agonist, inhibited expression of RORC2-regulated genes in peripheral Th17 cells (CD4+ CD25- CD127+ CXCR3- CCR4+ CCR6+ ) in a dose-dependent manner, with similar inhibitory effects on laminar propria mononuclear cells from IBD and non-IBD subjects. Exposure of peripheral Th17-Tregs (CD4+ CD25hi CD127lo CXCR3- CCR4+ CCR6+ ) to BMS-336 also inhibited IL-17A production and prevented inflammatory cytokine-induced destabilisation, as evidenced by preserved FOXP3 expression and epigenetic status of the Treg-specific demethylation region. In parallel, RORC2 inhibition increased the production of IL-10 in Th17-Tregs, resulting in enhanced suppression of inflammatory cytokines from myeloid cells. Thus, via its ability to simultaneously inhibit Th17 cells and enhance the stability and function of Th17-Tregs, pharmacological inhibition of RORC2 is a promising approach to suppress inflammation and promote immune regulation in IBD.

Key open questions are (1) whether NLRP3 inflammasome activation mainly in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) or rather in non-RPE cells promotes CNV, (2) whether inflammasome activation in CNV occurs via NLRP3 or also through NLRP3-independent mechanisms, and (3) whether complement activation induces inflammasome activation in CNV. Here we show in a neovascular AMD mouse model that NLRP3 inflammasome activation in non-RPE cells but not in RPE cells promotes CNV. We demonstrate that both NLRP3-dependent and NLRP3-independent inflammasome activation mechanisms induce CNV. Finally, we find that complement and inflammasomes promote CNV through independent mechanisms. Our findings uncover an unexpected role of non-NLRP3 inflammasomes for CNV and suggest that combination therapies targeting inflammasomes and complement may offer synergistic benefits to inhibit CNV.","Malsy, Jakob; Alvarado, Andrea C; Lamontagne, Joseph O; Strittmatter, Karin; Marneros, Alexander G",eLife,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.60194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305736/,665
143852,Have we misjudged the role of children in spreading COVID-19?,2020-09-21,"Metabolic rewiring is considered as a primary feature of cancer. Malignant cells reprogram metabolism pathway in response to various intrinsic and extrinsic drawback to fuel cell survival and growth. Among the complex metabolic pathways, pyrimidine biosynthesis is conserved in all living organism and is necessary to maintain cellular fundamental function (i.e. DNA and RNA biosynthesis). A wealth of evidence has demonstrated that dysfunction of pyrimidine metabolism is closely related to cancer progression and numerous drugs targeting pyrimidine metabolism have been approved for multiple types of cancer. However, the non-negligible side effects and limited efficacy warrants a better strategy for negating pyrimidine metabolism in cancer. In recent years, increased studies have evidenced the interplay of oncogenic signaling and pyrimidine synthesis in tumorigenesis. Here, we review the recent conceptual advances on pyrimidine metabolism, especially dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), in the framework of precision oncology medicine and prospect how this would guide the development of new drug precisely targeting the pyrimidine metabolism in cancer.","Wang, Wanyan; Cui, Jiayan; Ma, Hui; Lu, Weiqiang; Huang, Jin",Frontiers in oncology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.684961; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34123854/,665

STUDY DESIGN A consecutive study with follow-up of 15 patients with Zenker's diverticulum endoscopically treated using the LigaSure. METHODS All patients underwent an endoscopic division of the bridge between the esophagus and the diverticulum through a rigid diverticuloscope using the LigaSure. Variables such as demographics, symptoms, surgical details, complications, and outcome were collected during admission, and all patients were followed up 5 to 14 months after discharge. RESULTS The median age of patients was 76 years. The diverticula measured between 2 and 7 cm. The median time of surgery was 33 minutes. All patients but one resumed oral intake within 24 hours. One patient experienced prolonged coughing and vomiting immediately postoperatively and was hours later diagnosed with a perforation. The patient was successfully treated with antibiotics. At follow-up this patient was on a normal diet. At follow-up after 2 to 8 weeks, all patients were relieved of their preoperative symptoms. At follow-up after 5 to 14 months, all but three had relief of all symptoms. Two patients had relapse of the diverticulum and one had relapse of a stricture known from before the diverticulotomy. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that treating Zenker's diverticulum using the LigaSure instrument safely improves the patients condition. As a new operative instrument, the LigaSure technique constitutes in our opinion a valid and easy alternative for treatment of Zenker's diverticulum compared to other endoscopic techniques.","Nielsen, Hans Ulrik Kjaerem; Trolle, Waldemar; Rubek, Niclas; Homøe, Preben",The Laryngoscope,https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.24558; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24338450/,665

The extent of any existing cohorts investigating these outcomes in LMIC has not previously been described. METHODS We performed a systematic literature review to identify population cohort studies of adolescents in LMIC that assessed anthropometry and any of cardiovascular risk (blood pressure, physical activity, plasma glucose/lipid profile and substance misuse), puberty (age at menarche, Tanner staging, or other form of pubertal staging) or cognitive outcomes. Studies that recruited participants on the basis of a pre-existing condition or involved less than 500 young people were excluded. FINDINGS 1829 studies were identified, and 24 cohorts fulfilled inclusion criteria based in Asia (10), Africa (6) and South / Central America (8). 14 (58%) of cohorts identified were based in one of four countries; India, Brazil, Vietnam or Ethiopia. Only 2 cohorts included a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment, tanner pubertal staging, and cognitive outcomes. CONCLUSION Improved utilisation of existing datasets and additional cohort studies of adolescents in LMIC that collect contemporaneous measures of growth, cognition, cardiovascular risk and pubertal development are needed to better understand how this period of the life course influences future non-communicable disease morbidity and cognitive outcomes.","Ward, Joseph L; Harrison, Katherine; Viner, Russell M; Costello, Anthony; Heys, Michelle",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0190443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29338025/,665
147544,"Oncohematological diseases in the Vale do Paraíba, State of São Paulo: demographic aspects, prevalences and incidences.",2011,"BACKGROUND Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from large complex datasets without being explicitly programmed. Although ML is already widely manifest in our daily lives in various forms, the considerable potential of ML has yet to find its way into mainstream medical research and day-to-day clinical care. The complex diagnostic and therapeutic modalities used in neurosurgery provide a vast amount of data that is ideally suited for ML models. This systematic review explores ML's potential to assist and improve neurosurgical care. METHOD A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed and Embase databases to identify all potentially relevant studies up to January 1, 2017. All studies were included that evaluated ML models assisting neurosurgical treatment. RESULTS Of the 6,402 citations identified, 221 studies were selected after subsequent title/abstract and full-text screening. In these studies, ML was used to assist surgical treatment of patients with epilepsy, brain tumors, spinal lesions, neurovascular pathology, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, and hydrocephalus. Across multiple paradigms, ML was found to be a valuable tool for presurgical planning, intraoperative guidance, neurophysiological monitoring, and neurosurgical outcome prediction. CONCLUSIONS ML has started to find applications aimed at improving neurosurgical care by increasing the efficiency and precision of perioperative decision-making. A thorough validation of specific ML models is essential before implementation in clinical neurosurgical care. To bridge the gap between research and clinical care, practical and ethical issues should be considered parallel to the development of these techniques.","Senders, Joeky T; Zaki, Mark M; Karhade, Aditya V; Chang, Bliss; Gormley, William B; Broekman, Marike L; Smith, Timothy R; Arnaout, Omar",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-017-3385-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29134342/,665
147800,Temporal trend and factors associated to teenage pregnancy.,2020,"Tocilizumab has been repurposed against the 'cytokine storm' in the setting of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of tocilizumab in the management of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL and medRxiv for studies of tocilizumab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Primary objective was the effectiveness of tocilizumab on mortality. Secondary objectives included the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), composite endpoints of mortality or IMV and intensive care unit (ICU) admission or IMV, length of hospitalization and differences in mortality in subgroups (ICU and non-ICU patients and patients receiving or not receiving concomitant corticosteroids). We included 52 studies (nine randomized controlled trials [RCTs] and 43 observational) with a total of 27,004 patients. In both RCTs and observational studies, the use of tocilizumab was associated with a reduction in mortality; 11% in RCTs (risk ratio [RR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96) and 31% in observational studies (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.83). The need for IMV was reduced by 19% in RCTs (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.93), while no significant reduction was observed in observational studies. Both RCTs and observational studies showed a benefit from tocilizumab on the composite endpoint of mortality or IMV. Tocilizumab improved mortality both in ICU and non-ICU patients. Reduction in mortality was evident in observational studies regardless of the use of systemic corticosteroids, while that was not the case in the RCTs. Tocilizumab was associated with lower mortality and other clinically relevant outcomes in hospitalized patients with moderate-to-critical COVID-19.","Kyriakopoulos, Christos; Ntritsos, Georgios; Gogali, Athena; Milionis, Haralampos; Evangelou, Evangelos; Kostikas, Konstantinos",Respirology,https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.14152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34605114/,665
148621,Interview with Antonio Carlile Holanda Lavor: we must invest in research to learn how to guide families against COVID-19.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE Healthcare workers experience occupational risk of infection and may transmit infections to patients. Vaccination provides an efficient means of protecting workers and patients, but uptake may be low. We sought to identify factors influencing vaccine acceptance by healthcare workers in order to obtain insights leading to more effective vaccination programs in this population. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS We searched Medline, Embase, and CINAHL databases to identify studies published up to May 2012. Factors influencing vaccination acceptance were devised a priori. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed to generate summary estimates of effect. Heterogeneity and publication bias were explored using statistical tools. RESULTS Thirty-seven studies evaluating a variety of vaccines (against influenza, pertussis, smallpox, anthrax, and hepatitis B) were included. Homogeneous effects on vaccine acceptance were identified with desire for self-protection (odds ratio [OR], 3.42 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.42-4.82]) and desire to protect family and friends (OR, 3.28 [95% CI, 1.10-9.75]). Concern that vaccine transmits the illness it was meant to prevent decreased acceptance (OR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.30-0.58]). Differences in physician and nurse acceptance of immunization were seen between Asian and non-Asian studies. CONCLUSIONS Consideration of self-protection (rather than absolute disease risk or protection of patients) appears the strongest and most consistent driver of healthcare workers' decisions to accept vaccination, though other factors may also be impactful, and reasons for between-study divergence in effects is an important area for future research. This finding has important implications for the design of programs to enhance healthcare worker vaccine uptake.","Vasilevska, Marija; Ku, Jennifer; Fisman, David N",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1086/676427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24799647/,665

156386,"Aggressively find, test, trace and isolate to beat COVID-19.",2020-09-09,"OBJECTIVE COVID-19 pandemic represents a dramatic challenge for healthcare systems worldwide, and it also affects daily urological practice. After China and Italy, Tessin (Switzerland) has been hit the hardest, due to its close proximity to Lombardy and the high number of frontier workers in the area. Our objective was to share with the scientific community how, during the COVID-19 period, there has been a huge modification in urological emergencies throughout all hospitals included in the Ente Ospedaliero Cantonale (EOC). METHODS We retrospectively reviewed urgent urological consultations requested by the emergency department (ED) of the 4 public hospitals located in Tessin belonging to EOC in the 3-month period between February 15 and May 15, 2020, and compared them to the 2 previous years cases within the same time frame (February 15 to May 15, 2018 and 2019). The number of daily consultations, urgent invasive procedures performed, and admissions were evaluated. RESULTS The final sample resulted in 594 consultations performed in 2020, 974 in 2018, and 974 in 2019. A higher number of daily consultations were performed during 2018 and 2019. The number of daily admissions dropped consistently during the COVID-19 pandemic (737 vs. 392). CONCLUSIONS Our multicenter study aimed to quantify changes in urgent urological care in Tessin in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Urgent urology practice was dramatically affected with a remarkable reduction in urgent urological consultations, whereas a higher risk of admissions was observed in 2020, due to the severity of the patients.","Grasso, Angelica A C; Massa, Guido; Castelnuovo, Mauro",Urologia internationalis,https://doi.org/10.1159/000511757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33171475/,665

Incidences were quantified and compared with regard to age and method of implant fixation. METHODS Using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, 12 randomized controlled trials and 18 cohort studies were investigated for evidence-based outcomes following HXPLE and CPE use in 2,539 hips over a 5 to 15-year follow-up. RESULTS Lower rates of osteolysis, aseptic loosening, and implant revision were reported following use of HXLPE liners. Osteolysis was reduced from 25.4% with CPE to 4.05% with HXLPE in young patients, and from 29.7% to 6.6% in the older patient cohort. Similarities in osteolysis rates were observed when cemented (24.9% for CPE and 6.5% for HXLPE) and uncemented components (32.8% for CPE and 7.1% for HXLPE) were compared. No clear advantage in the type of HXLPE used was observed. CONCLUSIONS Over a follow-up period of up to 15 years, when compared with CPE, use of HXLPE liners reduced the incidence of osteolysis, aseptic loosening, and implant revision, regardless of the fixation method and including in younger and potentially more active patients.

This paper reinforces the present studies on international trade by analyzing the fragments of GVC, which are made of numerous Inter-Country Input-Output (ICIO) relations. We first redefine the inter-country and inter-sector propagating process of intermediate goods, coming up with the concept of Strongest Relevance Path Length (SRPL) based on Revised Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (RFWA). Second, enlightened by betweenness centrality, we introduce Weighted Betweenness Centrality of Edge based on RFWA to measure the Value-Added Pivotability of Input-Output Relations, which brings forth pivotability at domestic, international, and global levels. The results show how much a given country can influence the world economic pattern by linking worldwide upstream and downstream industrial sectors, be it at home or abroad. Also, we can try to explain what is the cause of the phenomenon that the economic influence of nations is trading off and taking turns with all sorts of local or even global evens happening.","Xing, L.

The Head domain features an unusual and conserved aspartic acid cluster at the trimer interface, which forms the only significant intra-trimer interactions in the Head, and must be protonated to allow trimer formation. Here we show that all domains of σ1 are remarkably thermostable across a wide range of pH, even at the low pH of the stomach. Interestingly, we determine the optimal pH for stability to be between pH 5-6, a value close to the pH of the endosome and of the jejunum. The σ1 Head is stable at acidic and neutral pH, but detrimerizes at basic pH. When Asp345 in the aspartic acid cluster is mutated to asparagine, the σ1 Head loses stability at low pH and is more prone to detrimerize. Overall, the presence of the Body stabilizes the σ1 Head.

184945,Mild SARS in elderly patients.,2004,"Adipose tissue (AT) plays a crucial role in maintaining me tabolic homeostasis by storing lipids and glucose from circulation as intracellular fat. As peripheral tissues like AT become insulin resistant, decompensation of blood glucose levels occurs causing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Currently, glycocalyx modulating as a pharmacological treatment strategy to improve glucose homeostasis in T2D patients is underexplored. Here, we show a novel role for cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) in establishing glucose uptake capacity and metabolic utilization in differentiated adipocytes. Using a combination of chemical and genetic interventions, we identified that HS modulates this metabolic phenotype by attenuating levels of Wnt signaling during adipogenesis. By engineering the glycocalyx of preadipocytes with exogenous synthetic HS mimetics, we were able to enhance glucose clearance capacity after differentiation through modulation of Wnt ligand availability. These findings establish the cellular glycocalyx as a possible new target for therapeutic intervention in T2D patients by enhancing glucose clearance capacity independent of insulin secretion. SIGNIFICANCE Metabolic disorders associated with the Western-style diet, such as type 2 diabetes, are among the main drivers of mortality in the US and globally, with more than 380 million people currently affected by this disease worldwide. However, treatment options for type 2 diabetes are currently limited to management of caloric uptake and expenditure, with none able to reverse the condition long-term. The ability to reprogram adipose tissues to improve their overall capacity to clear glucose may provide one such opportunity. Here we provide evidence that glycocalyx remodeling in pre-adipocytes with heparan sulfate mimetics will alter their differentiation program by modulating Wnt signaling to produce adipocytes with increased glucose uptake and utilization.","Trieger, Greg W.; Pessentheiner, Ariane R.; Purcell, Sean C.; Green, Courtney R.; DeForest, Natalie; Willert, Karl; Majithia, Amit R.; Metallo, Christian M.; Godula, Kamil; Gordts, Philip L.

The picture they paint of the possible risk of a global pandemic posed by the avian influenza virus H5N1 is indeed a chilling one, not only for the possible extent of the epidemic itself but also because of the likely burden it could place on an already thinly stretched healthcare workforce. It therefore raises a rather alarming contradiction. Given our recent experience of living through the consequences of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Ontario and BC, one would think that we would be more than willing this time around to err on the side of caution and be as prepared as possible to deal with the next emerging infectious agent that comes our way. But, surprisingly, as is carefully outlined in Silas et al.'s paper, this does not seem to be the case. In a healthcare environment that is increasingly focused on the need for evidence upon which to base change in practice, are we possibly dragging our heels in raising our preparedness for a future pandemic?

The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the results of the laparoscopic treatment of incisional hernia at our institution and to identify potential risk factors for recurrence. METHODS The medical data (pre-operative, peri-operative, and postoperative) of patients who received a laparoscopic repair of their incisional hernia between January 2003 and February 2007 were recorded. The follow-up was based on a retrospective analysis of the information found in the patients' medical records. RESULTS Seventy-four laparoscopic interventions were performed on 71 patients. Polyester implants with an average size of 412.16 cm2 were used to cover the hernia. The mean operative time was 76.8 +/- 55.6 min (range, 20 to 295 min) and the mean duration of post-operative hospitalisation was 3.75 +/- 2.3 days (range, 2 to 12 days). One breach in the small intestine (1.4%) (sutured with 3/0 silk thread) and 1 conversion to laparotomy (1.4%) for a voluminous incisional hernia occurred during surgery. The post-operative morbidity was 8.2%, the rate of long-term complications was 27%, and 13 recurrences (including 3 with complications) were noted (17.6%) during a mean follow-up of 13 months. There was no postoperative mortality. Recurrences were linked to the use of large meshes corresponding to large incisional hernia diameter (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Although the morbidity/mortality rates are acceptable, technical improvements must be found to reduce the recurrence rate, in particular for large incisional hernias.","Lahon, M; Simoens, Ch; Thill, V; Smets, D; Mendes Da Costa, P",Acta chirurgica Belgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19994801/,665

On 3 of the 12 ranches, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, or S dublin was implicated as the etiologic agent. Rotavirus and coronavirus were identified on 1 ranch and rotavirus alone on another. Salmonella arizonae serotype 26:30 was isolated from the feces of diarrheic lambs on 6 of the 12 ranches in this study. Pregnant ewes from 1 of the 6 ranches in which S arizonae was enzootic were transported to the Montana Veterinary Research Laboratory and studies on S arizonae were conducted in lambs from these ewes. Salmonella arizonae was shown to elaborate an enterotoxin, the activity of which was reduced when assayed in the gut loop test, using lambs from ewes vaccinated with an S arizonae 26:30 bacterin. Oral challenge inoculation of 22 young colostrum-fed lambs with S arizonae 26:30 failed to produce any significant enteric disease, in contrast to oral challenge inoculation with S. oranienburg which resulted in death, with severe diarrhea and dehydration, in 4 of 6 lambs tested. Salmonella arizonae serotype 26:30 appears to be well adapted to the ovine host and may not be a significant cause of diarrheal disease on ranches where it is enzootic.","Harp, J A; Myers, L L; Rich, J E; Gates, N L",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7332118/,665

However, the experiments undertaken have not addressed the need for tissue-type matching in order to achieve graft-mediated remyelination since they were performed in conditions in which the chance for graft rejection was minimized. This article focuses on the factors determining survival of allogeneic oligodendrocyte lineage cells and their contribution to the remyelination of demyelinating CNS lesions. The immune status of the CNS as well as the suitability of different models of demyelination for graft rejection studies are discussed, and ways of enhancing allogeneic oligodendrocyte-mediated remyelination are presented. Finally, the effects of glial graft rejection on host remyelination are described, highlighting the potential benefits of the acute CNS inflammatory response for myelin repair.","Tepavcević, V; Blakemore, W F","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

MATERIAL AND METHODS From January 1994 to January 2011, 122 males and 170 females with a mean age of 50.7 years (range: 19-84) underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) at 2 centers in Ancona and Rome (Italy) (that follow the same protocol). Fifteen patients underwent bilateral LA, the anterior transperitoneal approach was used in 233 cases (79.8%) and the anterior submesocolic in 59 (20.2%). One hundred and two patients had Conn's syndrome, 51 miscellaneous lesions, 55 Cushing's syndrome, 47 incidentalomas, 46 pheochromocytoma, 2 metastatic masses, 2 myelolipomas and 2 adrenogenital syndromes. The lesions had a mean diameter of 3.24 cm (range: 0.5-10). RESULTS Mean operating time was 120 minutes (range: 30-390). Conversion to open surgery was required in 13 cases (4,45%). Blood pressure and heart rate were stable during the operation. There were 5 major complications. Mobilization and resumption of diet occurred on the first postoperative day. Mean hospital stay was 4.32 days (range: 2-30). DISCUSSION Early identification and ligature of the adrenal vein, with minimal gland manipulation, are the major advantages, especially in case of pheochromocytoma.

189518,SARS outbreak in the Greater Toronto Area: the emergency department experience.,2004,"In addition to the conventional respiratory symptoms, patients with COVID-19 can exhibit neurological complications. In this concise review, we aim to report the most frequent neurologic manifestations related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection. SARS-CoV2 can reach the central nervous system from the bloodstream or olfactory pathway by binding ACE-2 receptor and the spike protein protease TMPRSS2. Headache is reported in more than 10% of affected patients and loss of smell and taste disturbance are reported in a slightly smaller percentage of cases. Acute cerebrovascular events are diagnosed in less than 3% of COVID-19 patients, but those with more severe manifestations have cerebrovascular events in more than 6% of the cases, as reported by two retrospective studies from Italy and China. Moreover, five cases of large-vessel stroke have been described in low-symptomatic COVID-19 patients aging less than 50 years suggesting that SARS-CoV2 can be associated with an increase of the risk of stroke in relatively young people. Peripheral nerve diseases can be observed after an apparently uneventful SARS-CoV2. Based on a literature review, nine patients experienced Guillain-Barrè syndrome (GBS) and 6 of these needed mechanical ventilation. Two more cases have been described with Miller-Fisher syndrome or polyneuritis cranialis, both had rapidly resolving symptoms. In conclusion, nervous system symptoms can be observed during SARS-CoV2 infection of which headache and smell and taste disturbance are the main symptoms reported. Cerebrovascular complications can complicate the course of COVID-19 in apparently low-risk patients. GBS is a life-threatening manifestation of COVID-19.","Brouwer, Matthijs C; Ascione, Tiziana; Pagliano, Pasquale",Le infezioni in medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32532937/,665

189911,Antiviral treatment of SARS: can we draw any conclusions?,2003,"Toroviruses (family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that have been implicated in enteric disease in cattle and possibly in humans. Despite their potential veterinary and clinical relevance, little is known about torovirus epidemiology and molecular genetics. Here, we present the first study into the diversity among toroviruses currently present in European swine and cattle herds. Comparative sequence analysis was performed focusing on the genes for the structural proteins S, M, HE, and N, with fecal specimens serving as sources of viral RNA. Sequence data published for animal and human torovirus variants were included. Four genotypes, displaying 30 to 40% divergence, were readily distinguished, exemplified by bovine torovirus (BToV) Breda, porcine torovirus (PToV) Markelo, equine torovirus Berne, and the putative human torovirus. The ungulate toroviruses apparently display host species preference. In phylogenetic analyses, all PToV variants clustered, while the recent European BToVs mostly resembled the New World BToV variant Breda, identified 19 years ago. However, we found ample evidence for recurring intertypic recombination. All newly characterized BToV variants seem to have arisen from a genetic exchange, during which the 3' end of the HE gene, the N gene, and the 3' nontranslated region of a Breda virus-like parent had been swapped for those of PToV. Moreover, some PToV and BToV variants carried chimeric HE genes, which apparently resulted from recombination events involving hitherto unknown toroviruses. From these observations, the existence of two additional torovirus genotypes can be inferred. Toroviruses may be even more promiscuous than their closest relatives, the coronaviruses and arteriviruses.","Smits, S L; Lavazza, A; Matiz, K; Horzinek, M C; Koopmans, M P; de Groot, R J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12915570/,665
191311,The race to outpace severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).,2003,"There is an emerging understanding that the severity of viral infections is not only related to the nature of the viral vector, but also to various social and biological factors, a number of which can be modified. The recent COVID-19 pandemic raises the issue as to what approaches might be important in reducing the severity of future viral pandemics beyond that of the pursuit of specific immunization to the vector and the development of drugs to treat its unique mechanism of replication. There is now evidence that lifestyle and environmental factors can serve as immunoadjuvants. Personalized lifestyle and environmental factors may therefore play a significant role in determining both the infectivity and pathogenicity of viruses. Once identified, these factors lend themselves to specific personalized intervention. This intervention focuses on renewal of immune system function through diet, activity, fluid intake, sleep, intestinal microbiome composition, and stress management. As more is learned about the factors that influence the function of specific components of the immune system, it becomes more evident that these modifiable factors have significant impact on the individual response to a viral exposure.","Bland, Jeffrey S",Integrative medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33041700/,665

Although understudied, pregnancy in the presence of COVID-19 increases the risk for illness severity. Data suggest that pregnant women with COVID-19 are more likely to be hospitalized, to be admitted to the intensive care unit, and to require life support. Similarly, COVID-19 poses significant challenges to maternal and obstetric care during the postpartum recovery period. African- American women bear a disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality burden for diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Pre-existing chronic health conditions may place pregnant and postpartum women at a higher risk for developing severe health consequences from COVID-19 before, during, and after delivery. In addition, social determinants of health are hypothesized to modulate the deleterious impact of COVID-19 among pregnant and postpartum African-American women.","Holness, Nola A; Barfield, Latisha; Burns, Vicki L; Clark, M Kathleen; Powell-Young, Yolanda M",Journal of National Black Nurses' Association : JNBNA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33617703/,665

Indeed, the consequences of the interaction that occurs between ecosystems, animals and people have shaped, and continue to shape, the course of human events and history. A reasoned and evidence-based assessment of the history of One Health must first be founded on an agreed definition of the term, but, given the many disciplines and sciences involved, finding such a definition is no easy task. Furthermore, there is an extensive and growing list of visionary individuals who have, over the centuries, attempted to promote awareness and advance the conceptto improve the management of the risks and consequences that arise at the interface between animal, human and ecosystem health. The One Health ideas of the 21st Century constitute a re-conceptualisation of health management in response to the accelerating environmental changes of the past 100 years, changes that are associated with the parallel exponential growth and concentration of the global human population. Consequently, the concept of One Health must recognise the constantly evolving relationship between animals and humans and the planet they share.","Evans, B R; Leighton, F A",Revue scientifique et technique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25707172/,665
192121,Updated SARS case definition using laboratory criteria.,2003,"OBJECTIVE To show that current rates of global population growth, production and consumption of food, and use of living and physical resources, are evidently not sustainable. To consider ways in which nutrition and allied sciences can respond to this great challenge of the twenty-first century. METHOD Past, current and future projected trends in production and consumption patterns are examined. These show that overall present and projected patterns cannot be sustained; and also show increasing unacceptable inequity between and within rich and poor regions and countries. DISCUSSION Nutrition science classically focuses on nutrients in relation to human physiology, metabolism, growth, health and disease. The social and environmental conditions of the modern, interconnected, market-oriented world, and the consequences for food production and consumption, are extending the research and policy agenda with which nutrition science must now urgently engage. Historically, much attention has been paid to eliminating nutritional deficiency states, and this remains an important task. In modern urban populations 'malnutrition' encompasses new forms of dietary imbalance, especially excesses of certain nutrients. These contribute to various non-communicable diseases and, particularly, to overweight/obesity and its attendant metabolic derangements and disease risks. As a mass phenomenon the current surge in obesity has no historical precedent. The escalating impact of humankind on the natural environment, with its ramifications for present and future food production, is also unprecedented. CONCLUSION The essential challenge for nutrition science is to develop new understanding and strategies to enable a balance between promoting, equitably, the health of humans while sustaining the long-term health of the biosphere. Extension of nutrition science and food policy to meet those goals will be aided by understanding better how dietary conditions shaped the biological evolution of humankind. The fundamental long-term task is to integrate human health with the health of the biosphere.","McMichael, Anthony J",Public health nutrition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16236205/,665
193834,Should paramedics intubate patients with SARS-like symptoms?,2003,"Mice (C57BL/6), treated with progesterone and infected intravaginally with the mouse pneumonitis strain of Chlamydia trachomatis (MoPn), acquired genital tract disease that ascended from the endocervix to the uterine horns, oviducts, and ovaries in a temporal fashion before the occurrence of spontaneous microbiological resolution by about 28 days after infection. Surprisingly, dissemination of MoPn in small numbers to draining lymph nodes, the peritoneal cavity, spleen, liver, kidneys, and lungs occurred in normal mice during the early stages of disease (7 to 14 days) in a portion of infected animals but resolved from these tissues, by microbiological criteria, prior to resolution of genital tract involvement. In contrast, gamma interferon knockout (IFN-gamma KO) mice exhibited dissemination of infection to a greater extent and for longer periods in a variety of tissues, and a portion of infected IFN-gamma KO mice failed to microbiologically resolve their genital tract disease. By comparison, C57BL/6 SCID mice uniformly failed to resolve their genital tract disease and exhibited high levels of dissemination to all tissues tested for extended (50-day) periods of times. Interestingly, although IFN-gamma KO mice failed to completely clear organisms from their genital tracts, they exhibited an attenuated infection indistinguishable from that of heterozygous littermates when challenged 112 days after primary infection. These data support a role for IFN-gamma in containing dissemination of MoPn from the genital tract to extragenital sites and in the microbiological resolution of infection. Data also indicate that IFN-gamma is not required for modulating reinfections, which normally follow a shorter and less dramatic course.","Cotter, T W; Ramsey, K H; Miranpuri, G S; Poulsen, C E; Byrne, G I",Infection and immunity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9169744/,665

Currently, few population-based state-level estimates of nonfatal occupational injury rates exist. In the few extant studies, self-reported, nonfatal occupational injury rates exceed estimates based on employer reports or state workers' compensation systems. To estimate the proportion of workers who were work-injured during the preceding 12 months and the proportion of those injured for whom workers' compensation insurance programs paid for medical care, 10 states added a module to their 2007 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. This report summarizes the results of that survey, which found that the proportion of workers who were work-injured during the preceding 12 months ranged from 4.0 to 6.9 work-injured persons per 100 employed persons (Kentucky and New York, respectively). The proportion of self-reported work-injured persons for whom medical treatment was paid by workers' compensation insurance ranged from 47% in Texas to 77% in Kentucky. This study shows the feasibility of complementing existing occupational injury surveillance through the use of population-based surveys.

Such developments allow today's CME providers to better meet the CRISIS criteria for effective continuing education: convenience, relevance, individualization, self-assessment, independent learning, and a systematic approach. The International Virtual Medical School (IVIMEDS) provides a case study that illustrates how rapid growth of the Internet and e-learning can alter undergraduate education and has the potential to alter the nature of CME. Key components are a bank of reusable learning objects, a virtual practice with virtual patients, a learning-outcomes framework, and self-assessment instruments. Learning is facilitated by a curriculum map, guided-learning resources, ""ask-the-expert"" opportunities, and collaborative or peer-to-peer learning. The educational philosophy is ""just-for-you"" learning (learning customized to the content, educational strategy, and distribution needs of the individual physician) and ""just-in-time"" learning (learning resources available to physicians when they are required). Implications of the new learning technologies are profound.

194506,The best protection.,2003,"INTRODUCTION This study was designed to quantitatively evaluate the sealing effect of a polyvinyl chloride tapered endotracheal tube cuff and to compare the tapered cuff with cylindrical endotracheal tube cuffs using an in vitro viscous fluid model. METHODS Five types of 8.0 mm inner diameter endotracheal tubes (TaperGuard, PortexSacett, PortexSoftseal, Sheridan HVT, Sheridan CF) were fixed in vertically placed 20mm internal diameter acrylic tubes. The cuffs were inflated to 25 mmHg pressure and water was added to the top of the cuff. The amount of water leaking around the cuff at five minutes was measured. Afterwards a viscous fluid was poured above the cuff and the amount of fluid passing around the cuff at five minutes and four hours was measured. Each determination was repeated five times and the data analyzed. RESULTS The median (range) amount (ml) of dyed water passing around the cuff at 5 minutes was TaperGuard tube 0 (0-0.2), PortexSacett 81.1 (44.6-107.9), PortexSoftseal 95.4 (91.4-113.7), Sheridan HVT 46.5 (32.7-74.6) and Sheridan CF 52.6 (31.9-62.2), suggesting that TaperGuard significantly (P<0.05) reduced fluid leakage. The viscous fluid leakage at 5 minutes was not significantly different among the groups while the amount of leaked viscous fluid at 4 hours was 0.2 (0-1.1) for the TaperGuard, 57.6 (11.9-117.4) for the PortexSacett, 23.2 (13.8-33.0) for the PortexSoftseal, 5.5 (2.7-15.4) for the Sheridan HVT and 5.6 (1.8-7.9) for the Sheridan CF. CONCLUSION An endotracheal tube with a tapered polyvinyl chloride cuff had significantly less fluid leakage compared to four tubes with cylindrical cuffs.","Shiotsuka, J; Lefor, A T; Sanui, M; Nagata, O; Horiguchi, A; Sasabuchi, Y",HSR proceedings in intensive care & cardiovascular anesthesia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23439857/,665

196186,The immediate psychological and occupational impact of the 2003 SARS outbreak in a teaching hospital.,2003,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a demyelinating disorder most common in childhood and adolescence and thought to have an immune pathogenesis. Some children with ADEM develop additional temporally remote episodes of demyelination with localizations that differ from those of the initial episode and multiple sclerosis is diagnosed. Others have only a single episode. Still others have recurrent episodes in temporal proximity to or with the same localizations as the initial presentation. This review is aimed at delineating what will be required to arrive at a definition of ADEM so as to distinguish it from childhood multiple sclerosis on first presentation. RECENT FINDINGS All studies to date aimed at differential characterization of ADEM and childhood multiple sclerosis have been retrospective case reviews. Each has examined a different array of historical, physical examination, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics of a differently defined patient population. SUMMARY Defining ADEM and distinguishing it from multiple sclerosis early in the course of the latter disease depends critically on standardization of prospective, multicenter study design, execution, and data analysis. This has become of paramount importance, as preventive therapies have evolved for recurrent attacks of multiple sclerosis.","Alper, Gulay; Schor, Nina Felice",Current opinion in pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15548925/,665

DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS Retrospective study of the records of patients who received CRRT in The Alfred intensive care unit from June 2011 to May 2012. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Filter run time. METHODS We matched filter run time to site and type of vascular access. Mean run times were compared using a linear mixed-effects model between: temporary femoral, internal jugular (IJ) and subclavian catheters, tunnelled semipermanent IJ catheters, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuit access. The Markov chain Monte Carlo method was used to construct 95% confidence intervals, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for post hoc testing of significance. RESULTS Filter run-time data were available for 131 patients (191 occasions of vascular access) with a total of 870 individual filters analysed. Mean run times were subclavian, 14.4 h; IJ, 17.1 h; femoral, 20.2 h; tunnelled IJ, 25.2 h; and ECMO, 29.0 h. Differences were significant for all combinations except between subclavian and IJ, and between tunnelled access and ECMO. Sites in order of best performing to worst-performing were ECMO circuit, tunnelled IJ, femoral vein, direct IJ vein, and subclavian vein. CONCLUSION Vascular access for CRRT plays a significant role in determining filter life. Our study suggests that for temporary dialysis catheters the femoral site should be favoured in ICU patients, and if CRRT is likely to continue for an extended period, a tunnelled IJ line should be considered.","Crosswell, Ashley; Brain, Matthew J; Roodenburg, Owen",Critical care and resuscitation : journal of the Australasian Academy of Critical Care Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24888283/,665
196664,Effect of widespread restrictions on the use of hospital services during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome.,2007,"In order to establish nonlytic persistent infections (PI) of BHK cells, replicons derived from Sindbis (SIN) and Semliki Forest (SFV) viruses have mutations in nsP2. Five different nsP2 PI replicons were compared to wild-type (wt) SIN, SFV, and wt nsPs SIN replicons. Replicon PI BHK21 cells had viral RNA synthesis rates that were less than 5% of those of the wt virus and approximately 10% or less of those of SIN wt replicon-infected cells, and, in contrast to wt virus and replicons containing wt nsP2, all showed a phenotype of continuous minus-strand synthesis and of unstable, mature replication/transcription complexes (RC+) that are active in plus-strand synthesis. Minus-strand synthesis and incorporation of [3H]uridine into replicative intermediates differed among PI replicons, depending on the location of the mutation in nsP2. Minus-strand synthesis by PI cells appeared normal; it was dependent on continuous P123 and P1234 polyprotein synthesis and ceased when protein synthesis was inhibited. The failure by the PI replicons to shut off minus-strand synthesis was not due to some defect in the PI cells but rather was due to the loss of some function in the mutated nsP2. This was demonstrated by showing that superinfection of PI cells with wt SFV triggered the shutdown of minus-strand synthesis, which we believe is a host response to infection with alphaviruses. Together, the results indicate alphavirus nsP2 functions to engage the host response to infection and activate a switch from the early-to-late phase. The loss of this function leads to continuous viral minus-strand synthesis and the production of unstable RC+.","Sawicki, Dorothea L; Perri, Silvia; Polo, John M; Sawicki, Stanley G",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16352561/,665
198415,Lessons from SARS.,2003,"COVID-19 is a highly contagious and infectious disease, spreading rapidly worldwide. Its high spread rate has turned it into public stigma. The current study is focusing on its treatment and control strategies on the basis of the facts and figs obtained from previous studies. Supplementation of infected person with minerals and vitamin would be very beneficial for faster recovery like in any other acute viral infection. Blood of a recovered person in any outbreak is very precious because it is containing high levels of neutralizing antibodies, memory T and B cells population. Both serum and buffy coat fractions of the blood will helpful for treatment as well as prophylaxis. The S proteins (spike) of SARS CoV 2 and SARS CoV 1 have 70% similarity so the vaccine available for SARS would also be effective for COVID-19. Besides this, genome of SARS CoV 2 has been sequenced successfully and it is quite easy for the scientists to prepare DNA based vaccines and peptide-based subunit vaccines targeting the S protein of the virus. To control the spread of COVID-19, various disinfectant and antiseptics are very useful. The virus is also susceptible to heat, low pH and UV light so hot climatic conditions are also lethal to this virus.","Khan, Kinza; Yaqub, Tahir",Pakistan journal of pharmaceutical sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33583808/,665
198838,[Renal transplantation during COVID-19 period in Spain.],2020-06-01,"OBJECTIVE To report a case of severe propylene glycol-induced lactic acidosis not attributable to renal dysfunction that was secondary to administration of high-dose intravenous lorazepam. CASE SUMMARY A 24-year-old female with community-acquired pneumonia presented with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. To maintain adequate sedation and ventilation and reduce airway pressure, several relaxation strategies were used including high-dose intravenous lorazepam, fentanyl, and cisatracurium. After 18 days of high-dose continuous infusion of lorazepam (maximum dose 50 mg/h), the patient developed severe lactic acidosis secondary to propylene glycol toxicity, the main diluent of lorazepam. The acidosis temporarily resolved with bicarbonate administration and discontinuation of lorazepam. Her renal function remained stable for a time (serum creatinine 0.5 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 10 mg/dL, urine output 100-200 mL/h). However, after several more days, the patient's condition deteriorated, and she ultimately died. DISCUSSION Previous cases of propylene glycol toxicity secondary to high-dose lorazepam infusion have occurred in patients with compromised renal function. Our patient's renal function remained stable throughout the hospital course, which caused us to look further for an explanation for the propylene glycol-induced lactic acidosis. Based on the Naranjo probability scale, propylene glycol was determined to be the probable cause of lactic acidosis. Since this case occurred, our intensive care unit has instituted recommendations for the prevention of lorazepam-associated propylene glycol toxicity. CONCLUSIONS Our case highlights the development of propylene glycol-induced lactic acidosis secondary to high-dose lorazepam infusion not associated with renal dysfunction.","Neale, Bruce W; Mesler, Eleanor L; Young, Michael; Rebuck, Jill A; Weise, Wolfgang J",The Annals of pharmacotherapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16159998/,665
200343,Dilemas morais da gestão pública brasileira no enfrentamento da pandemia do novo coronavírus,2020,"Cationic CPPs (cell-penetrating peptides) have been used largely for intracellular delivery of low-molecular-mass drugs, biomolecules and particles. Most cationic CPPs bind to cell-associated glycosaminoglycans and are internalized by endocytosis, although the detailed mechanisms involved remain controversial. Sequestration and degradation in endocytic vesicles severely limits the efficiency of cytoplasmic and/or nuclear delivery of CPP-conjugated material. Re-routing the splicing machinery by using steric-block ON (oligonucleotide) analogues, such as PNAs (peptide nucleic acids) or PMOs (phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers), has consequently been inefficient when ONs are conjugated with standard CPPs such as Tat (transactivator of transcription), R(9) (nona-arginine), K(8) (octalysine) or penetratin in the absence of endosomolytic agents. New arginine-rich CPPs such as (R-Ahx-R)(4) (6-aminohexanoic acid-spaced oligo-arginine) or R(6) (hexa-arginine)-penetratin conjugated to PMO or PNA resulted in efficient splicing correction at non-cytotoxic doses in the absence of chloroquine. SAR (structure-activity relationship) analyses are underway to optimize these peptide delivery vectors and to understand their mechanisms of cellular internalization.","Abes, R; Arzumanov, A A; Moulton, H M; Abes, S; Ivanova, G D; Iversen, P L; Gait, M J; Lebleu, B",Biochemical Society transactions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17635146/,665

Physicians managing patients with cancer now have to deal not only with the disease but also the restrictions and limitations imposed because of the global pandemic. We aimed to determine how surgical preferences in breast cancer management were affected globally using a questionnaire-based survey. METHODS Under the auspices of the Turkish Senology Society (SENATURK) we asked 122 surgeons from 27 countries to reply to a 26-question survey designed to measure the impact of COVID-19 on their surgical practice when treating patients with breast cancer. RESULTS The characteristics of participant surgeons were statistically similar when comparing the participants' answers from Turkey and other countries. From the responses given to our questionnaire, it was understood that breast cancer surgery decreased by 25% (p<0.05) in institutions all over the world, including Turkey, but there was no change in the approach technique to the axilla. CONCLUSIONS Globally breast surgeons have adapted to the new normal due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many surgical approaches and some follow up protocols have been changed, although the degree of change has varied from country to country. In addition, the availability of multidisciplinary case conferences has been reduced in some centers which may affect the quality of services provided to patients.","Canturk, Nuh Zafer; Guler, Sertac Ata; Kocdor, Mehmet Ali; Simsek, Turgay",Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34564998/,665

201402,COVID 19 and mask in sports,2020,"Type III interferons (IFNs), a new type IFN family consisting of 3 IFN-lambdas, have been identified through a homology search. They include IFN-lambda1, IFN-lambda2 and IFN-lambda3, which are also named as interleukin (IL)-29, IL-28A and IL-28B, respectively. The receptor complex of IFN-lambdas is composed of the IL-10 receptor beta (IL-10Rbeta) and a novel IL-28 receptor alpha (IL-28Ralpha). The signal transductions of type III IFNs seem to be similar to those of type I IFNs. Both type I and III IFNs activate Janus activated kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway and transcribe a number of IFN-associated genes. Various types of viruses induce expressions of type III IFNs as well as type I IFNs; however, the biological functions of type III IFNs could be distinct from those of type I IFNs partly because of the tissue-restricted expression of the type III receptor complexes. In this review, we encapsulate recent understandings about type III IFNs in particular the anti-tumor effects, and discuss possible mechanisms and a potential use for cancer therapy.","Li, Quanhai; Kawamura, Kiyoko; Tada, Yuji; Shimada, Hideaki; Hiroshima, Kenzo; Tagawa, Masatoshi",Frontiers in bioscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23747856/,665

We compared these concerns and preparedness between 326 HCWs of two community hospitals (CHs) and 908 HCWs from a tertiary hospital (TH) using a self-administered questionnaire between March-June 2006. Response rates were 84.2% and 80.0% from the CHs and TH. Most HCWs (71.6%) felt prepared for an AI outbreak and had significant concerns. They perceive an AI pandemic having adverse impacts on their personal life and work, such as people avoiding them (57.1%). A greater percentage of TH compared to CH HCWs expressed concerns such as feeling their jobs put them at great AI exposure (78.3% vs 67.5%, p=0.012). TH HCWs were more likely to report participating in readiness preparation activities, such as training for infection control (90.0% vs 82.2%, p=0.014) and feel that they (74.1% vs 64.7%, p=0.045) and their hospital (86.8% vs 71.8%, p=0.000) were prepared for an outbreak. Healthcare institutions need to include personal, psychological and family concerns on the agenda and increase participation in readiness preparation activities among HCWs to help prepare for such future crises.","Cheong, Seng Kwing; Wong, Teck Yee; Lee, Heow Yong; Fong, Yuke Tien; Tan, Boon Yeow; Koh, Gerald Ch; Chan, Kin Ming; Chia, Sin Eng; Koh, David",Industrial health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18057808/,665

In primitive organisms, RNAi protects the genome from viruses and other insertable genetic elements and regulates gene expression during development. The antisense (guide) strand of short double-stranded RNAs is incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex that can either suppress protein expression or direct degradation of messenger RNAs that contain homologous sequence(s). The discovery that RNAi works in mammalian cells has sparked intense investigation into its role in normal mammalian cell function, its use as a tool to understand or screen for genes functioning in cellular pathways in healthy and diseased cells and animals, and its potential for therapeutic gene silencing. RNAi may provide an important new therapeutic modality for treating infection, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and other illnesses, although in vivo delivery of small interfering RNAs into cells remains a significant obstacle.","Dykxhoorn, Derek M; Lieberman, Judy",Annual review of medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15660519/,665

While most of the efforts are usually targeted towards protecting individuals from getting infected, &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; eliminating transmissions from infection sources is also important to prevent disease transmission. Supportive therapies for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) pneumonia such as oxygen supplementation, nebulizers and non-invasive mechanical ventilation all carry an increased risk for viral transmission via aerosol to healthcare workers. &lt;sup&gt;5-9&lt;/sup&gt; In this work, we study the efficacy of five methods for self-containing aerosols emitted from infected subjects undergoing nebulization therapies with a diverse spectrum on oxygen delivery therapies. The work includes five study cases: Case I: Use of a Full-Face Mask with biofilter in bilevel positive airway pressure device (BPAP) therapy, Case II: Use of surgical mask in High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) therapy, Case III: Use of a modified silicone disposable mask in a HFNC therapy, Case IV: Use of a modified silicone disposable mask with a regular nebulizer and normal breathing, Case V: Use of a mitigation box with biofilter in a Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilator (NIPPV). We demonstrate that while cases I, III and IV showed efficacies of 98-100%;cases II and V , which are the most commonly used, resulted with significantly lower efficacies of 10-24% to mitigate the dispersion of nebulization aerosols. Therefore, implementing cases I, III and IV in health care facilities may help battle the contaminations and infections via aerosol transmission during a pandemic.","Patel, B.; Forzani, E.; Lowell, A.; McKay, K.; Karam, K.

Among Black individuals who were tested for COVID-19, we found similar infection rates among SCT carriers (14/72; 19.7%) and noncarriers (167/791; 21.1%), but higher COVID-19 mortality rates among SCT carriers (4/14; 28.6%) than among noncarriers (21/167; 12.6%) (odds ratio [OR], 3.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-11.82; P = 0.12).

209067,Plano municipal de contingência à Covid-19 [Taguatinga ­ TO],2020,"BACKGROUND: In 2020, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 impacted Georgia, USA. Georgia announced a state-wide shelter-in-place on April 2 and partially lifted restrictions on April 27. We estimated the time-varying reproduction numbers (Rt) of COVID-19 in Georgia, Metro Atlanta, and Dougherty County and environs from March 2, 2020, to November 20, 2020. METHODS: We analyzed the daily incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Georgia, Metro Atlanta, and Dougherty County and its surrounding counties, and estimated Rt using the R package EpiEstim. We used a 9-day correction for the date of report to analyze the data by assumed date of infection. RESULTS: The median Rt estimate in Georgia dropped from between 2 and 4 in mid-March to < 2 in late March to around 1 from mid-April to November. Regarding Metro Atlanta, Rt fluctuated above 1.5 in March and around 1 since April. In Dougherty County, the median Rt declined from around 2 in late March to 0.32 on April 26. Then, Rt fluctuated around 1 in May through November. Counties surrounding Dougherty County registered an increase in Rt estimates days after a superspreading event occurred in the area. CONCLUSIONS: In Spring 2020, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 transmission in Georgia declined likely because of social distancing measures. However, because restrictions were relaxed in late April and elections were conducted in November, community transmission continued, with Rt fluctuating around 1 across Georgia, Metro Atlanta, and Dougherty County as of November 2020. The superspreading event in Dougherty County affected surrounding areas, indicating the possibility of local transmission in neighboring counties.","Muniz-Rodriguez, Kamalich; Chowell, Gerardo; Schwind, Jessica S; Ford, Randall; Ofori, Sylvia K; Ogwara, Chigozie A; Davies, Margaret R; Jacobs, Terrence; Cheung, Chi-Hin; Cowan, Logan T; Hansen, Andrew R; Chun-Hai Fung, Isaac",Perm. j.

In response to this pandemic, most psychological responses have been at a higher prevalence such as stress, anxiety, depression, lower mental well-being, poor sleep quality, along with the fear of contracting the COVID-19 disease. Related to these psychological responses, previous studies have suggested an association between COVID-19 fear and stress as well as stress and sleep quality. The present study aimed to assess the association between COVID-19 fear and sleep quality and investigate the possible mediating effect of perceived stress during this pandemic. The data were collected, utilizing a self-report online questionnaire, from a sample of 521 Bangladeshi adults. Results showed significant gender differences in COVID-19 fear, stress, and sleep quality and also a significant association between these variables. Mediation results revealed that stress fully mediated the association between COVID-19 fear and sleep quality for males and partially mediated it for females. These results suggest that women are in a more vulnerable position in this pandemic.

224775,O médico de família e o Covid-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: To date, influenza epidemics have been considered suitable for use as a model for the COVID-19 epidemic, given that they are respiratory diseases with similar modes of transmission. However, data directly comparing the two diseases are scarce. METHODS: We did a nationwide retrospective cohort study using the French national administrative database (PMSI), which includes discharge summaries for all hospital admissions in France. All patients hospitalised for COVID-19 from March 1 to April 30, 2020, and all patients hospitalised for influenza between Dec 1, 2018, and Feb 28, 2019, were included. The diagnosis of COVID-19 (International Classification of Diseases [10th edition] codes U07.10, U07.11, U07.12, U07.14, or U07.15) or influenza (J09, J10, or J11) comprised primary, related, or associated diagnosis. Comparisons of risk factors, clinical characteristics, and outcomes between patients hospitalised for COVID-19 and influenza were done, with data also stratified by age group. FINDINGS: 89â530 patients with COVID-19 and 45â819 patients with influenza were hospitalised in France during the respective study periods. The median age of patients was 68 years (IQR 52-82) for COVID-19 and 71 years (34-84) for influenza. Patients with COVID-19 were more frequently obese or overweight, and more frequently had diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia than patients with influenza, whereas those with influenza more frequently had heart failure, chronic respiratory disease, cirrhosis, and deficiency anaemia. Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 more frequently developed acute respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, septic shock, or haemorrhagic stroke than patients with influenza, but less frequently developed myocardial infarction or atrial fibrillation. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with influenza (15â104 [16·9%] of 89â530 vs 2640 [5·8%] of 45â819), with a relative risk of death of 2·9 (95% CI 2·8-3·0) and an age-standardised mortality ratio of 2·82. Of the patients hospitalised, the proportion of paediatric patients (<18 years) was smaller for COVID-19 than for influenza (1227 [1·4%] vs 8942 [19·5%]), but a larger proportion of patients younger than 5 years needed intensive care support for COVID-19 than for influenza (14 [2·3%] of 613 vs 65 [0·9%] of 6973). In adolescents (11-17 years), the in-hospital mortality was ten-times higher for COVID-19 than for influenza (five [1·1% of 458 vs one [0·1%] of 804), and patients with COVID-19 were more frequently obese or overweight. INTERPRETATION: The presentation of patients with COVID-19 and seasonal influenza requiring hospitalisation differs considerably. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is likely to have a higher potential for respiratory pathogenicity, leading to more respiratory complications and to higher mortality. In children, although the rate of hospitalisation for COVID-19 appears to be lower than for influenza, in-hospital mortality is higher; however, low patient numbers limit this finding. These findings highlight the importance of appropriate preventive measures for COVID-19, as well as the need for a specific vaccine and treatment.

Investigated experiences included exposure to COVID-19-related news, having being in close proximity to people with a COVID-19 diagnosis or with COVID-19-like symptoms, having being sick or having suffered COVID-19-like symptoms, having tested negative for COVID-19. METHODS: Adults from northern Italy (n = 326; M age = 29.86) provided cross-sectional data through an online survey during the nationwide lockdown period. Structural equation modelling analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Perceived and anticipated stigma, exposure to COVID-19 news, perceived threat and impact on material resources access were negatively and indirectly related to both hedonic and eudaimonic well-being via perceived COVID-19 psychological impact which served as a mediator. Perceived stigma was also directly and negatively related to hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, whereas having tested negative for COVID diagnosis was positively and directly associated with eudaimonic well-being. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-related stigma and appraisals can impair positive feelings about life as well as the pursuit of self-realization and the search for meaning in life. The findings highlight the importance of developing psychological preventive and rehabilitative interventions to help people cope with these risk factors.","Paleari, F Giorgia; Pivetti, Monica; Galati, Desirèe; Fincham, Frank D",Br. j. health psychol,,665
238370,Feeding our autonomy: resilience in the face of the CoVid-19 and future pandemics,2020,"BACKGROUND: Several descriptive studies have reported that higher neutrophil count (NC) may be correlated with poor prognosis in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. However, the findings from these studies are limited by methodology and data analysis. METHODS: This study is a cohort study. We non-selectively and consecutively collected a total of 663 participants in a Chinese hospital from January 7 to February 28. Standardized and two-piecewise Cox regression model were employed to evaluated the association between baseline neutrophil count (bNC), NC change rate (NCR), and death. RESULTS: bNC had a U-shaped association with death. In the range of 0.1 to &#8804;1.49×109 /L (HR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.66) and > 3.55×109 /L of bNC (HR = 2.82, 95% CI = 1.19 to 6.67), the trends on bNC with mortality were opposite. By recursive algorithm, the bNC at which the risk of the death was lower was range of >1.49 to &#8804;3.55×109 /L (HR=13.64, 95%CI=0.25 to 74.71). In addition, we find NCRs (NCR1 and NCR2) is not associated with COVID-19-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with NCR, bNC has the potential to be used for early risk stratification in patients with COVID-19 infection. The relationship between bNC and mortality was U-shaped. The safe range of bNC was 1.64 to 4.0 ×109 /L. Identifying the correlation may be helpful for early risk stratification and medical decision making. This article is protected by copyright.

To solve these problems, it is important to focus on robust features in intra-class variation. Existing attention-based Re-ID methods focus only on common features without considering distinctive features. In this paper, we present a novel attentive learning-based Siamese network for person Re-ID. Unlike existing methods, we designed an attention module and attention loss using the properties of the Siamese network to concentrate attention on common and distinctive features. The attention module consists of channel attention to select important channels and encoder-decoder attention to observe the whole body shape. We modified the triplet loss into an attention loss, called uniformity loss. The uniformity loss generates a unique attention map, which focuses on both common and discriminative features. Extensive experiments show that the proposed network compares favorably to the state-of-the-art methods on three large-scale benchmarks including Market-1501, CUHK03 and DukeMTMC-ReID datasets.","Jeong, Dasol; Park, Hasil; Shin, Joongchol; Kang, Donggoo; Paik, Joonki",,,665

It is presently believed that detection of specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is an effective screening and diagnostic indicator for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, a combination of nucleic acid and specific antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 will be more effective to diagnose COVID-19, especially to exclude suspected cases.","Zhao, Kaochang; Ai, Li; Zhao, Yang; Wang, Tao; Zheng, Zhishui; Zeng, Shaolin; Ding, Xuhong; Hu, Suping; Nie, Hanxiang",Epidemiol Infect,,665

Our work identified that PDCD4 is highly expressed in axons and dendrites of CNS and PNS neurons, with loss and gain of function experiments in cortical and dorsal root ganglia primary neurons demonstrating the capacity of PDCD4 to negatively control axonal growth. To explore PDCD4 transcriptome and translatome targets we used Ribo-Seq and uncovered a list of potential targets with known functions as axon/neurite outgrowth regulators. In addition, we observed that PDCD4 can be locally synthesized in adult axons in vivo and its levels decrease at the site of peripheral nerve injury and before nerve regeneration. Overall, our findings demonstrate that PDCD4 can act as a new regulator of axonal growth via the selective control of translation, providing a target mechanism for axon regeneration and neuronal plasticity processes in neurons.","Di Paolo, Andres Pablo; Eastman, Guillermo; Mesquita Ribeiro, Raquel; Farias, Joaquina; Macklin, Andrew; Kislinger, Thomas; Colburn, Nancy; Munroe, David; Sotelo Sosa, Jose Roberto; Dajas Bailador, Federico; Sotelo Silveira, Jose Roberto",RNA,,665

We report the case of a 64-year-old male patient who underwent explantation of a shoulder prosthesis due to a periprosthetic infection. He was tested SARS-CoV-2 positive 7 days after admission to the orthopaedic department following strict infection control measures, routinely including screening all patients for multi-drug-resistant organism (MDRO) colonization upon admission. Aim of our study is to report on the spreading potential of SARS-CoV-2 in a healthcare setting if standard contact precautions and infection control measures have been established. METHODS: All HCW with exposure to the patient from day of admission until confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified and underwent oropharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Sixty-six HCW were identified: nine orthopaedic surgeons, four anaesthesiologists, 25 orthopaedic nurses, five nurse anesthetists, eight scrub nurses, five nursing students, two medical assistants and seven service employees. Fourteen HCW (21%) showed clinical symptoms compatible with a SARS-CoV-2 infection: cough (n = 4), sore throat (n = 3), nasal congestion (n = 3), dyspnea (n = 2), fever (n = 1), headache and myalgia (n = 1). SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in any of the 66 HCW. CONCLUSION: Hygienic measures and contact precautions, aimed at preventing the spread of MRDO, may have helped to prevent a SARS-CoV-2 transmission to HCW-despite high-risk exposure during intubation, surgical treatment and general care.

270533,"COVID-19, the Anthropocene, and transformative change",2020,"Adolescence is a formative period for socio-emotional development which is threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The current longitudinal study examined two aims: (1) the short- and long-term effects of the pandemic on young people's mood (i.e. vigor, tension, and depression levels) and emotional reactivity (i.e. fluctuations in daily mood), and (2) the impact of stressors on mood, emotional reactivity, self-oriented (i.e. maladaptive behavior towards COVID-19 rules) and other-benefitting behaviors (i.e. behavior aimed at helping and comforting others). We conducted an online two-week daily diary study among 462 Dutch adolescents (Mage = 15.27 years, 64% females) and 371 young adults (Mage = 21.49 years, 81% females) in May 2020, with a follow-up in November 2020 (N = 238 and 231, respectively adolescents and young adults). In May 2020, young adults and older relative to younger adolescents showed higher levels and more fluctuations in tension and depression and lower levels of vigor. Vigor levels decreased and tension and depression levels increased between May 2020 and November 2020, especially for younger adolescents. There were positive associations between instability of negative emotions (i.e. tension and depression fluctuations) and the exposure to stressors (i.e. family stress and inequality of online homeschooling) in the adolescent sample. Together, this study demonstrates vulnerability regarding young people's mood and emotional reactivity during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for adolescents who experience more stressors.","Green, Kayla H; van de Groep, Suzanne; Sweijen, Sophie W; Becht, Andrik I; Buijzen, Moniek; de Leeuw, Rebecca N H; Remmerswaal, Danielle; van der Zanden, Rianne; Engels, Rutger C M E; Crone, Eveline A",Sci Rep,,665

274681,COVID-19 outbreak in a peruvian shelter,2020,"On January 7 in China, one patient was identified with a new corona virus in throat culture, and World Health Organization called it severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Herein, we aimed to summarize overall data for COVID-19 disease related myocarditis and its treatment. In the initial stages, patients developed symptoms of severe acute respiratory infection and afterwards other serious symptoms such as septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation disorders, multiple organ failure problems developed. Complications were mostly associated with pneumonia (91.1%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Before the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, the presence of cardiovascular diseases has been found to increase the severity and side effects of primary respiratory syndrome. Since management of COVID-19 related myocarditis is crucial, 114 publications indexed in Pubmed between Dec 10, 2019 and October 16, 2020 were scanned extensively in this review in order to summarize the treatment options of COVID-19 related myocarditis. Analysis of 44.672 COVID-19 cases showed an increased risk of mortality in elderly people (14.8% for patients over 80 years old) and patients with cardiovascular disease (10.5%). Patients with diabetes (7.3%) and hypertension (6%) also demonstrated an increased risk of mortality. The rate of underlying chronic respiratory disease was 6.3%. Arrhythmia was found in 16.7% and acute heart injury existed in 7.2% of 138 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. ACE inhibitors or ARBs should be administered in patients with wall motion abnormality or heart failure with reduced EF. Diuretics should be considered in patients with volume overload and torsemide should be preferred as first option. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs and cardiac glycosides should be avoided. Physical activity should be restricted until the disease resolved. IVIG and interferon therapy are feasible treatment options with reasonable side effect profile.

277261,Clinical Characteristics of Moderate COVID-19 Patients Aggravation in Wuhan Stadium Cabin Hospital: A 571 Cases of Retrospective Cohort Study,2020,"Entrepreneurship is increasingly emphasized as a pathway out of poverty. However, the complex, multi-faceted nature of the poverty experience has important implications for the ability to launch and sustain viable businesses. All entrepreneurs must overcome the liabilities of newness and smallness, as reflected in a lack of legitimacy with stakeholders, inadequate resources and capabilities, an unclear identity, misunderstood roles and unclear role definitions, few established routines and procedures, and little bargaining power. However, poverty entrepreneurs face an additional barrier, which we term the liability of poorness. Four underlying dimensions of the liability of poorness are identified: literacy shortcomings, a scarcity mindset, significant non-business distractions, and the lack of financial slack or a safety net. The manner in which each of these interacting elements exacerbate the entrepreneur's ability to address the liabilities of newness and smallness is explored. It is argued that, as the liability of poorness becomes greater, the vulnerability and fragility of the poverty entrepreneur's venture are apt to increase. Under such circumstances, significant external shocks and unexpected occurrences, such as the economic shutdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, typically have a more devastating impact on the ventures of the poor. Policies are needed to level the playing field.","Morris, Michael H.",Poverty Public Policy,,665

This study used a convenience sampling technique to examine factors associated with misinformation about COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa using an online cross-sectional survey. A link to the online self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 1,969 participants through social media platforms and the authors' email networks. Four false statements-informed by results from a pilot study-were included in the survey. The participants' responses were classified as ""Agree,"" ""Neutral,"" and ""Disagree."" A multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associated factors. Among those who responded to the survey, 19.3% believed that COVID-19 was designed to reduce world population, 22.2% thought the ability to hold your breath for 10 seconds meant that you do not have COVID-19, 27.8% believed drinking hot water flushes down the virus, and 13.9% thought that COVID-19 had little effect on Blacks compared with Whites. An average of 33.7% were unsure whether the 4 false statements were true. Multivariate analysis revealed that those who thought COVID-19 was unlikely to continue in their countries reported higher odds of believing in these 4 false statements. Other significant factors associated with belief in misinformation were age (older adults), employment status (unemployed), gender (female), education (bachelor's degree), and knowledge about the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Strategies to reduce the spread of false information about COVID-19 and other future pandemics should target these subpopulations, especially those with limited education.

282683,Covid-19 in santiago de cuba province from an implicative statistical analysis,2020,"INTRODUCTION: With the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the world has been experiencing an extraordinary state of emergency. As patients entering a doctor's practice can potentially infect medical staff and other patients, using digital alternatives wherever possible is a potential solution to avoiding face-to-face encounters. In these conditions, telemedicine is becoming increasingly relevant. Hence, the aim of this study was to examine telemedicine use and gathered experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In June 2020, a representative group of Austrian respondents (n = 1000) was asked via online survey whether they had contacted a doctor during spring of 2020, and, if so, whether they had used a telemedical method to do so. The survey also reflected gathered experiences and degrees of satisfaction with the use of telemedicine. RESULTS: A third (33%) of those who contacted a doctor during the target period did so using telemedical tools. The majority of those with previous telehealth experience were satisfied with the help they received. Patients commonly used a telephone to contact their doctors. The overall assessment of telemedical aids tended to be positive, with more than half (53%) of those surveyed seeing significant advantages, and a 90% satisfaction rate among the respondents who used telehealth services. CONCLUSION: The outcomes from this work hint at fairly high acceptance of telemedical communication tools in the studied group of the Austrian population. Based on the high rate of satisfaction among patients who used telehealth, it is expected that the use of telehealth services will increase further in the near future.","Kletecka-Pulker, Maria; Völkl-Kernstock, Sabine; Fassl, Anna; Klager, Elisabeth; Willschke, Harald; Klomfar, Sophie; Wochele-Thoma, Thomas; Schaden, Eva; Atanasov, Atanas G",,,665

We report a 52-year-old man with hypertension and newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and developed severe brachial plexopathy. He was not treated with prone positioning respiratory therapy. Associated with the flaccid, painfully numb left upper extremity was a livedoid, purpuric rash on his left hand and forearm consistent with COVID-19-induced microangiopathy. Neuroimaging and electrophysiological data were consistent with near diffuse left brachial plexitis with selective sparing of axillary, suprascapular and pectoral fascicles. Given his microangiopathic rash, elevated D-dimers and paucifascicular plexopathy, we postulate a patchy microvascular thrombotic plexopathy.

305192,Description of patients with severe COVID-19 treated in a national referral hospital in Peru,2020,"Rapid diagnosis and case isolation are pivotal to controlling the current pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this study, a label-free DNA capacitive biosensor for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 that demonstrates real-time, low-cost, and high-throughput screening of nucleic acid samples is presented. Our novel biosensor composed of the interdigitated platinum/titanium electrodes on the glass substrate can detect the hybridization of analyte DNA with probe DNA. The hybridization signals of specific DNA sequences were verified through exhaustive physicochemical analytical techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry, contact-angle analysis, and capacitance-frequency measurements. For a single-step hybridized reaction, the fabricated kit exhibited significant sensitivity (capacitance change, &#916;C = ~2 nF) in detecting the conserved region of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene with high sensitivity of 0.843 nF/nM. In addition to capacitive measurements, this selective detection was confirmed by the fluorescence image and intensity from a SARS-CoV-2 gene labeled with a fluorescent dye. We also demonstrated that the kits are recyclable by surface ozone treatment using UV irradiation. Thus, these kits could potentially be applied to various types of label-free DNA, thereby acting as rapid, cost-effective biosensors for several diseases.","Hwang, Chuljin; Park, Nakkyun; Kim, Eun Seong; Kim, Miran; Kim, Su Dong; Park, Sungjun; Kim, Nam Young; Kim, Joo Hee",Biosens Bioelectron,,665
305751,Atrium,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID)-secure workplace guidance, including the prompt self-isolation of those with COVID-19 symptoms, is fundamental to disease control in workplaces. Despite guidance, a large number of workplace outbreaks have been observed. This study aimed to identify the proportion of symptomatic staff members attending workplaces after symptom onset or testing, and associated factors. METHODS: This study of symptomatic COVID-19 cases associated with London workplaces used London Coronavirus Response Centre (LCRC) records from routine telephone calls with cases and employers, from 17th July to 10th September. For each case, symptoms, date of onset, date of testing and the last attendance at work were extracted. Univariable logistic regression was performed to investigate whether age, gender or occupation was associated with workplace attendance after the onset of symptoms. RESULTS: Out of 130 symptomatic COVID-19 cases, 42 (32.3%) attended the workplace after their reported date of symptom onset, including 16 (12.3%) with recorded COVID-19 symptoms. Five staff members attended after COVID-19 testing. Males were 66% less likely to attend the workplace after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms compared to females (odds ratio 0.34, P = 0.05). Age and occupation were not predictive for workplace attendance after the onset of symptoms. CONCLUSION: A minority of symptomatic cases attended the workplace after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms, with a smaller proportion attending after testing. Males appeared less likely to attend the workplace after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. This study highlights the need for ongoing COVID-19 secure workplace practices and prompt self-isolation after COVID-19 symptom onset or testing.","Jain, Vageesh; Waghorn, Maria; Thorn-Heathcock, Rachel; Lamb, Peter; Bell, Anita; Addiman, Sarah",J. public health (Oxf),,665

310820,Viral and Antibody Kinetics of COVID-19 Patients with Different Disease Severities in Acute and Convalescent Phases: A 6-Month Follow-Up Study,2020,"Extraordinary limitation of certain fundamental rights seems necessary in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Many countries have declared a state of emergency for that purpose. Yet, there is also a risk of misusing the emergency for power grabbing, especially in the current era of executive aggrandizement, democratic decay and abusive populist constitutionalism. In this setting the legislative and judicial checks on the executive create a dilemma. Their standard operation in the state of emergency could control the executive, but might also impair its capacity to fight the pandemic effectively. This article therefore focuses on the desired role of the legislature and the judiciary in COVID-19 emergencies. Although many constitutions address emergencies, they are often vague and leave considerable room for the involved actors themselves to adjust their behaviour. This article asks how parliaments and courts should use this de facto room. I argue that they should show some deference to the executive, its level depending on the stage and severity of the crisis, but should not clear the field for governments. They must modify their activities but not suspend them. My main argument is that the deliberative and scrutiny functions of the legislature and the dispute-resolution function of courts are crucial not only for preventing the abuse of emergency measures, but also for increasing the effectiveness of emergency measures by improving conditions necessary for compliance. The legislature and courts can contribute to the higher feasibility and legitimacy of the emergency measures and thereby increase voluntary compliance, which is crucial for tackling the spread of the new coronavirus. The article illustrates these issues by way of the case study of the Czech Republic–a country experiencing its first nationwide state of emergency amid tendencies towards democratic decay and managerial populism.","Petrov, Jan",Theo.

311126,Arterial thrombotic complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Response to related letters,2020,"Mist evaporation cooling (MEC) is increasingly used as a low-energy means to improve thermal comfort in hot environments. However, the thermal sensation votes (TSV) often overshoot values of Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) models. Evaluations of MEC may be affected by an expectation that mist feels cool or the “good subject” effect. Here, subjects are exposed to a misting fan and an identical fan without mist and asked which fan feels cooler. Unknown to the subjects, the misting fan has almost no cooling effect (about 0.4 K reduction in air temperature) and a hidden heater increased the temperature of the misting fan air flow, making it up to 1.6 K warmer than the fan without mist. Supplemental experiments told the subjects about the heater. Surveys of over 300 subjects when varying this misted air temperature showed a bias above random chance that people vote that a misting fan airflow was cooler, even when it was the same temperature or slightly warmer than the non-misting fan. It is possible that the expectation of cooling or good subject effect influences evaluations of mist. This effect should be considered in thermal comfort evaluations of mist cooling and in the deployment of MEC systems.","Farnham, Craig Yuan Jihui",Clean Technologies,,665

However, Colombia has insufficient studies on mining and its repercussions, which limits estimates of mining impacts on ecosystems and the human population. Due to the rise of mining activities in Colombia, the negative impacts generated by coal and Hg will also continue to increase. This review analyzes national information levels on coal and Hg in island/coastal/marine as well as freshwater ecosystems and human groups using fishery resources as a framework. This is because fish are the main source of animal protein in marine coastal-island and mainland communities. Here, 15 of 32 Colombian departments have records on total mercury (THg) in water, sediments, fish, and human communities. Around 205 ton/year of mercury is discharged into the ecosystem. In human hair for example (15.3 to 50.15 µg/g), mercury exceeds the international maximum levels allowed (ILA) and the national standard (5.0 µg/g). Mercury levels in freshwater fish show 3.3 µg/g of THg and levels in marine and coastal-island fish are 1.2 µg/g THg exceeding the ILA (0.5 µg/g) standard for fish that will be consumed. Carnivorous species have a THg between 0.04 and 2.55 µg/g suggesting bioaccumulation and magnification of heavy metals. These findings were then compared with available international information.","de Paula Gutiérrez, B Francisco; Agudelo, César Augusto Ruiz",,,665

315530,"Association between myocardial injury and prognosis of COVID-19 hospitalized patients, with or without heart disease. CARDIOVID registry",2020,"Background: A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak due to the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection occurred in China in late December 2019. Facemask wearing with proper hand hygiene is considered an effective measure to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but facemask wearing has become a social concern due to the global facemask shortage. China is the major facemask producer in the world, contributing to 50% of global production. However, a universal facemask wearing policy would put an enormous burden on the facemask supply. Methods: We performed a policy review concerning facemasks using government websites and mathematical modelling shortage analyses based on data obtained from the National Health Commission (NHC), the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and General Administration of Customs (GAC) of the People's Republic of China. Three scenarios with respect to wearing facemasks were considered: (1) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation in all regions of mainland China; (2) a universal facemask wearing policy implementation only in the epicentre (Hubei province, China); and (3) no implementation of a universal facemask wearing policy. Findings: Regardless of different universal facemask wearing policy scenarios, facemask shortage would occur but eventually end during our prediction period (from 20 Jan 2020 to 30 Jun 2020). The duration of the facemask shortage described in the scenarios of a country-wide universal facemask wearing policy, a universal facemask wearing policy in the epicentre, and no universal facemask wearing policy were 132, seven, and four days, respectively. During the prediction period, the largest daily facemask shortages were predicted to be 589·5, 49·3, and 37·5 million in each of the three scenarios, respectively. In any scenario, an N95 mask shortage was predicted to occur on 24 January 2020 with a daily facemask shortage of 2·2 million. Interpretation: Implementing a universal facemask wearing policy in the whole of China could lead to severe facemask shortage. Without effective public communication, a universal facemask wearing policy could result in societal panic and subsequently, increase the nationwide and worldwide demand for facemasks. These increased demands could cause a facemask shortage for healthcare workers and reduce the effectiveness of outbreak control in the affected regions, eventually leading to a pandemic. To fight novel infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, governments should monitor domestic facemask supplies and give priority to healthcare workers. The risk of asymptomatic transmission and facemask shortages should be carefully evaluated before introducing a universal facemask wearing policy in high-risk regions. Public health measures aimed at improving hand hygiene and effective public communication should be considered along with the facemask policy.","Wu, Huai-Liang; Huang, Jian; Zhang, Casper J P; He, Zonglin; Ming, Wai-Kit",EClinicalMedicine,,665

Among the first promising repurposing agents proposed for treatment and prophylaxis, 2 antimalarial agents came into limelight: chloroquine and its less toxic derivative, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Intense research and public debates have followed. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: As HCQ is still used and studied, future research may bring novel evidence, modifying the state-of-the-art. Despite the lack of a single randomized control trial (RCT) with positive results, there are currently (as for the search on 30th of August 2020) more than 250 RCT registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with HCQ in COVID patients, and more than 150 of them are ""still recruiting"" or ""not yet recruiting"" patients. DATA SOURCES: Our study combines a therapeutic evaluation of RCT data with a sociological analysis of related controversies, examining scientific and public arena discourses. RESULTS: Although any hope of a positive effect was brought exclusively by some and not all of the observational studies, none of the 7 RCT published until now have found any benefit. From a sociological perspective, the HCQ controversy is a useful case study for understanding the construction of plausibility in a cultural context polarized into competing versions of reality, with different epistemologies and ideologies. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the first RCTs have been published, and they are disappointing; beneficial effects of HCQ could not be proven either for negative conversion on polymerase chain reactions of COVID patients or for postexposure prophylaxis. The question to be asked is: how many studies do we need until HCQ is abandoned? Argumentative time work, appealing to temporal properties of HCQ including its historical use, accumulation of evidence, alternative therapeutic scenarios, and sensationalist tempo for rhetorical purpose, plays a significant role in its continuing legitimation.","Rughinis, Cosima; Dima, Lorena; Vasile, Sorina",Am J Ther,,665

The world of sport has obviously been severely affected by the pandemic, as authorities progressively canceled all level of competitions, including the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. In Spain, the initial government-lockdown closed the Sports High-performance Centers, and many other sports facilities. In order to support athlete's health and performance at crises like these, an online questionnaire named RECOVID-19, was designed to assess how athletes were living their lives during such periods of home confinement. The main purpose of the questionnaire was to assess the impact of prolongued confinement on athlete's psychological, emotional, and behavioral performance. One thousand, two hundred forty-eight athletes participated in the survey. They had the fllowing characteristics: (Mean age = 22.31 +/- 11.49, Female: 53%), who compete at National (N: 1017, Mean age = 21.58 +/- 11.42, Female: 52%) and International level (N: 231, Mean age = 25.56 +/- 11.22, Female: 57%). Results showed that during the confinement period, those athletes who lacked motivation reported a higher level of stressful thoughts, more behavioral problems, and greater emotional upheaval (anger, fatigue, tension, and depression). However, those athletes who accepted confinement measures as necessary, and were in favor of respecting the rules of social isolation, fostered positive emotional states such as feelings of friendship. In addition, the availability of some sport equipment together with the ability to continue some training, were (1) protective factors against emotional stress, lack of motivation and behavioral problems;and (2) they were associated with greater respect for, and adherence to, confinement rules. Gender differences, tested by multigroup analysis, revealed that coping activities were more often associated to negative emotional states among women, whereas the ongoing availability of training information and future conditions were equally protective factors for both genders. This study also showed that receiving coaching, support and completing frequent training routines seem to be valuable tools to prevent or reduce some of the harmful effects of isolation on athlete's emotional well-being. The conclusions derived from this research would possibly help sport authorities to design supporting policies and plans to support athletes and trainers in future disruptive health crises.","Jaenes Sanchez, J.

In this review, we discuss recent findings regarding the relationship between variations in DNA methylation level patterns and aging. In addition, we introduce the known mechanisms by which DNA methylation regulators affect aging and related diseases.

SOD1-positive aggregates in motor neurons, as well as proteins that interact with the aggregates are presumably involved in ALS neurotoxicity. We used a proteomics approach to compare differences in protein expression in spinal cord homogenates from non-transgenic (NTG) and ALS model mice. Using the homogenates, we identified proteins that interacted with SOD1 seeds in vitro. We assessed differences in SOD1-interacting proteins in cell cultures treated with proteasome or autophagy inhibitor. In the first experiment, intermediate filamentous and small heat shock proteins were upregulated in glial cells. We identified 26 protein types that interacted with aggregation cores in ALS model homogenates, and unexpectedly, 40 proteins in were detected in NTG mice. In cell cultures treated with proteasome and autophagy inhibitors, we identified 16 and 11 SOD1-interacting proteins, respectively, and seven proteins in untreated cells. These SOD1-interacting proteins were involved in multiple cellular functions such as protein quality control, cytoskeletal organization, and pathways involved in growth factor signaling and their downstream cascades. The complex interactions between pathways could cause further dysregulation, ultimately leading to fatal cellular dysfunction in ALS.","Une, Mio; Yamakawa, Miho; Watanabe, Yasuhiro; Uchino, Kazuyuki; Honda, Naoto; Adachi, Mayuka; Nakanishi, Mami; Umezawa, Akihiro; Kawata, Yasushi; Nakashima, Kenji; Hanajima, Ritsuko",Neurosci. res,,665

This article describes the recent developments and measures from March through May 2020, which have contributed to the maintenance of ophthalmological care at in-patient departments of ophthalmology. METHODS: PubMed literature search, own data, interhospital survey. RESULTS: The rapid implementation of infection and hygiene control measures and adaptation of standard operating procedures (SOP) to minimize the risk of infection, along with prioritized urgent and emergency care combined with postponement of elective procedures enabled the continuous care of ophthalmological patients. CONCLUSION: Despite the challenge of a significant shift of medical resources during the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic, medically urgently necessary ophthalmological treatments are continuously provided by maximum care clinics; however, based on currently available data, it cannot be ruled out whether treatment of emergency patients was delayed during the pandemic.","Hattenbach, Lars-Olof; Reinhard, Thomas; Walter, Peter; Roider, Johannes; Feltgen, Nicolas; Hesse, Lutz; Schrecker, Jens; Eter, Nicole",Ophthalmologe,,665
356013,Cultura organizacional de segurança na pandemia pela COVID-19,2021,"The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has been a burden on the worldwide population, with mass fatalities and devastating socioeconomic consequences. It has particularly drawn attention to the lack of approved small-molecule drugs to inhibit SARS coronaviruses. Importantly, lessons learned from the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1), can be applied to current drug discovery ventures. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 both possess two cysteine proteases, the main protease (Mpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro), which play a significant role in facilitating viral replication, and are important drug targets. The non-covalent inhibitor, GRL-0617, which was found to inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-1, and more recently SARS-CoV-2, is the only PLpro inhibitor co-crystallised with the recently solved SARS-CoV-2 PLpro crystal structure. Therefore, the GRL-0617 structural template and pharmacophore features are instrumental in the design and development of more potent PLpro inhibitors. In this work, we conducted scaffold hopping using GRL-0617 as a reference to screen over 339,000 ligands in the chemical space using the ChemDiv, MayBridge, and Enamine screening libraries. Twenty-four distinct scaffolds with structural and electrostatic similarity to GRL-0617 were obtained. These proceeded to molecular docking against PLpro using the AutoDock tools. Of two compounds that showed the most favourable predicted binding affinities to the target site, as well as comparable protein-ligand interactions to GRL-0617, one was chosen for further analogue-based work. Twenty-seven analogues of this compound were further docked against the PLpro, which resulted in two additional hits with promising docking profiles. Our in silico pipeline consisted of an integrative four-step approach: (1) ligand-based virtual screening (scaffold-hopping), (2) molecular docking, (3) an analogue search, and, (4) evaluation of scaffold drug-likeness, to identify promising scaffolds and eliminate those with undesirable properties. Overall, we present four novel, and lipophilic, scaffolds obtained from an exhaustive search of diverse and uncharted regions of chemical space, which may be further explored in vitro through structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies in the search for more potent inhibitors. Furthermore, these scaffolds were predicted to have fewer off-target interactions than GRL-0617. Lastly, to our knowledge, this work contains the largest ligand-based virtual screen performed against GRL-0617.","Hajbabaie, Roxanna; Harper, Matthew T; Rahman, Taufiq",Molecules (Basel),,665

However, ypTNM stage, especially ypN stage does not predict patient survival after NCRT well. Whether tumor regression in lymph nodes (LRG) may improve the prediction has not been well studied. In total, 358 patients with rectal cancer who received NCRT followed by radical resection were recruited from 2004 to 2015, and the median follow-up time was 57.5 months. The main outcome measure was disease-free survival (DFS). In univariate analysis, factors associated with DFS were ypT stage, ypN stage, number of negative lymph nodes (NLN), lymph node ratio (LNR), tumor regression grade (TRG), M-TTRG (modified ypT stage by combining ypT stage and TRG), maximum LRG (LRGmax), sum score of LRG (LRGsum), LRG ratio (average value of LRGsum), and M-NLRG (modified ypN stage by combining LRGmax and LNR). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, M-TTRG and M-NLRG (p < 0.001 and p = 0.030, respectively) were significantly associated with DFS. The estimated 5-year DFS rates were 86.6%, 60.3%, and 36.4% for patients with M-NLRG-0, M-NLRG-1, and M-NLRG-2, respectively (p < 0.001). A significant difference in survival was observed among patients with NCRT after incorporating TRG and LRG simultaneously into the current ypTNM staging system (p < 0.001). LRG was an important prognostic factor in rectal cancer patients treated with NCRT and could refine the ypTNM staging system. The modified ypTNM staging system in combination with LRGmax, LNR, and TRG could improve the DFS prediction in each subset of patients.","Cui, Jian; Zhang, Lin; Yang, Lin; Zhu, Yue-Lu; Fang, Hui; Chen, Bo; Ning, Yi; Zhang, Hai-Zeng",Cancer med,,665

Motivated by the behavior of SARS-CoV-2, we construct a theoretical SIR model of a virus that exhibits presymptomatic, asymptomatic, and symptomatic stages in two possible pathways. Using agent-based simulations on small world networks, we observe phase transitions for epidemic spread related to: 1) Global social distancing with a fixed probability of adherence. 2) Individually initiated social isolation when a threshold number of contacts are infected. 3) Viral shedding rate. The primary driver of total number of infections is the viral shedding rate, with probability of social distancing being the next critical factor. Individually initiated social isolation was effective when initiated in response to a single infected contact. For each of these control measures, the total number of infections exhibits a sharp phase transition as the strength of the measure is varied.","Braun, Benjamin; Taraktas, Basak; Beckage, Brian; Molofsky, Jane",PLoS One,,665

Out of the seven women, five were infected during the first trimester. The mean gestational age at delivery was 38.4 weeks. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results for maternal plasma, cord blood, placenta, and amniotic fluid were negative and IgG antibodies were detected in maternal plasma and cord blood. On placental pathology, maternal vascular malperfusion was found in only one case, fetal vascular malperfusion in four cases, and inflammatory changes were found in two cases. Pregnancy outcomes for women diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection during early pregnancy are positive and it is likely that maternal antibodies are passed to the fetus, which results in a period of immunity.","Jang, Won-Kyu; Lee, Su-Yeon; Park, Sunggyun; Ryoo, Nam Hee; Hwang, Ilseon; Park, Ji Min; Bae, Jin-Gon",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,665

METHODS: This prospective comparative cohort study comprised 66 patients complaining of new-onset non-specific typical dry eye 1 month after uncomplicated cataract surgery. Subjects were randomly allocated into control and omega-3 groups based on administration of the systemic rTG form of omega-3 fatty acids for 2 months, in addition to use of artificial teardrop. Ocular surface parameters (Schirmer's test, tear break-up time, corneal staining score and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)) and subjective questionnaire results (Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)) and Dry Eye Questionnaire [DEQ]) for dry eye were evaluated before and after omega-3 supplementation. RESULTS: Two months after omega-3 supplementation, the Oxford score was lower in the omega-3 group than in the control group. There was an improvement of subjective symptom scores of OSDI and DEQ in the omega-3 group (both p<0.05). The ratio of increasing MMP-9 level in the omega-3 group was lower than that in the control group (p=0.027). CONCLUSION: The rTG form of omega-3 supplementation might be related to reduction of ocular surface inflammation rather than secretion of tears, and it might be effective for non-specific typical dry eye after uncomplicated cataract surgery.

430437,A small Iowa farmer's perspective on COVID-19,2020,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D), like other autoimmune diseases, is on the rise since the second half of the 20th century. Hypothetically this has been ascribed to restricted exposure to microbial diversity due to advanced hygienic practices accompanying modernization, and increasing prosperity in urban versus rural habitats. The autoimmune animal model of T1D, inhibited by Bacillus Calmette Guerine (BCG), motivated testing the impact of BCG on T1D incidence in humans. Several epidemiological analyses, short of one, failed to demonstrate a protective effect of BCG against T1D. The present retrospective analysis of two data sets reevaluates the hypothetic inhibitory effect of BCG on human T1D. Reassessment of data from a Swedish study reveals that a single BCG vaccination provided a small but significant protection against T1D. A second data set of T1D prevalence/1000 Israeli military conscripts, from a doctoral thesis presenting 17 birth cohorts at age 17 is evaluated against the national schedule of vaccination related to years of birth. To correct for the annual increasing T1D trend the mean urbanization (census) rate was set as an annual moving average and factored into the prevalence (T1D/1000) of respective birth cohorts. Three groups of cohorts corresponding to BCG vaccination are presently identified; Group A corresponds to the years in which newborns were vaccinated and boosted if necessary, at age 12. Group B corresponds to the period when boosting was discontinued. Group C corresponds to years when newborn BCG vaccination was discontinued. T1D (only in females) was slightly but significantly lower in group B (n = 5 cohorts) versus C (n = 8 cohorts, p = 0.0475, by Mann Whitney U test). T1D in group A (n = 4 cohorts) was lower than in group B (p = 0.02). This analysis supports the hypothesis that in human females postnatal BCG vaccination, reinforced by boosting, has a protective impact on T1D being superior to omitted boosting, which in its turn is still better than stopping vaccination altogether. This analysis further suggests that upon advanced modernization the BCG vaccine compensates for reduced exposure to microbial diversity early in life.","Klein, Benjamin Y",Vaccine,,665

Regarding social factors, we identified the return of indigenous people to their communities, poor access to water, language barriers, and limited access to the Internet, as factors that will not allow them to take the minimum preventive measures against the disease. Additionally, environmental risk factors associated with pollutants from biomass burning were identified. In health, the lack of coverage in these areas and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, respiratory tract infections, and chronic pulmonary diseases were identified. Some existing government programmes were identified that could be supported to address these social, environmental and health gaps. We believe that the best way to address these issues is to strengthen the health system with a community-based approach. Health is the best element of cohesion for inserting development and progress proposals in indigenous communities, given the vulnerability to which they are exposed in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a context when testing was limited, we calculated the basic reproduction number (R0) in 63 regions from the growth in regional death counts. After adjusting for population density, early spread of the epidemic, and age structure, temperature and humidity were negatively associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility. A reduction of mean absolute humidity by 1 g/m3 was associated with a 0.15-unit increase of R0. Below 10 °C, a temperature reduction of 1 °C was associated with a 0.16-unit increase of R0. Our results confirm a dependency of SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility to weather conditions in the absence of control measures during the first wave. The transition from summer to winter, corresponding to drop in temperature associated with an overall decrease in absolute humidity, likely contributed to the intensification of the second wave in north-west hemisphere countries. Non-pharmaceutical interventions must be adjusted to account for increased transmissibility in winter conditions.","Landier, Jordi; Paireau, Juliette; Rebaudet, Stanislas; Legendre, Eva; Lehot, Laurent; Fontanet, Arnaud; Cauchemez, Simon; Gaudart, Jean",Sci Rep,,665

на 34,3% больше В большей степени выросло количество смертей от инфекционных заболеваний (в 10,3 раз у мужчин и 12,7 раз у женщин), болезней эндокринной системы (в 2,6 и 2,2 раз соответственно), симптомов, признаков и неточно обозначенных состояний (на 64,7% и 70,7%), а у мужчин - и болезней мочеполовой системы (на 64,7%) Уменьшилось количество смертей от новообразований (на 5,2% и 5,7%), травм и отравлений (на 24,4% и 27,1%) Заключение: Структура причин смерти москвичей во время пандемии изменилась не только из-за увеличения доли инфекционной смертности, но и из-за роста смертности от заболеваний, которые были часто ассоциированы с инфицированием коронавирусом Согласно полученным результатам, к ним относились сахарный диабет 2 типа, ожирение, хронический тубулоинтерстициальный нефрит, поликистоз почек, хроническая ишемическая болезнь сердца, поражение сосудов мозга (I67 8), инфаркт мозга и хроническая обструктивная болезнь лёгких С учётом сверхсмертности от этих заболеваний и неопределённых причин смерти реальное количество умерших от COVID-19 может вдвое превосходить количество подтверждённых случаев Предположительно, проводимое посмертное исследование лиц с подозрением на заражение коронавирусом выявляет не все случаи инфицирования","Sabgayda, Tamara Ivanova Allа Rudnev Sergey Semenova Viktoriya",Social Aspects of Population Health,,665

Measurement as a means to improvement],2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a single-stranded RNA genome that encodes 14 open reading frames (ORFs), eight of which encode accessory proteins that allow the virus to infect the host and promote virulence. The genome expresses around 29 structural and nonstructural protein products. The accessory proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are not essential for virus replication but do affect viral release, stability, and pathogenesis and finally contribute to virulence. This paper has attempted the structure prediction and functional analysis of two such accessory proteins, 9b and ORF14, in the absence of experimental structures. Sequence analysis, structure prediction, functional characterization, and evolutionary analysis based on the UniProtKB reviewed the amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV-2 9b (P0DTD2) and ORF14 (P0DTD3) proteins. Modeling has been presented with the introduction of hybrid comparative and ab initio modeling. QMEANDisCo 4.0.0 and ProQ3 for global and local (per residue) quality estimates verified the structures as high quality, which may be attributed to structure-based drug design targets. Tunnel analysis revealed the presence of 1-2 highly active tunneling sites, perhaps which will able to provide certain inputs for advanced structure-based drug design or to formulate potential vaccines in the absence of a complete experimental structure. The evolutionary analysis of both proteins of human SARS-CoV-2 indicates close relatedness to the bat coronavirus. The whole-genome phylogeny indicates that only the new bat coronavirus followed by pangolin coronaviruses has a close evolutionary relationship with the novel SARS-CoV-2.","Baruah, Chittaranjan; Devi, Papari; Sharma, Dhirendra K",Biomed Res Int,,665

493552,Thrombus in the right atrium after COVID-19 pneumonia,2020,"BACKGROUND: Transmission of many viruses occurs by direct transmission during a close contact between two hosts, or by an indirect transmission through the environment. Several and often interconnected factors, both abiotic and biotic, determine the persistence of these viruses released in the environment, which can last from a few seconds to several years. Moreover, viruses in the environment are able to travel short to very long distances, especially in the air or in water. SUMMARY: Although well described now, the role of these environments as intermediaries or as reservoirs in virus transmission has been extensively studied and debated in the last century. The majority of these discoveries, such as the pioneer work on bacteria transmission, the progressive discoveries of viruses, as well as the persistence of the influenza virus in the air varying along with droplet sizes, or the role of water in the transmission of poliovirus, have contributed to the improvement of public health. Recent outbreaks of human coronavirus, influenza virus, and Ebola virus have also demonstrated the contemporaneity of these research studies and the need to study virus persistence in the environment. Key Messages: In this review, we discuss historical discoveries that contributed to describe biotic and abiotic factors determining viral persistence in the environment.","Labadie, Thomas; Batéjat, Christophe; Leclercq, India; Manuguerra, Jean-Claude",Intervirology,,665

The asymptomatic carriers were not suspected of playing a significant role in the ongoing pandemic, and universal nucleic acid screening in close contacts of confirmed cases and asymptomatic carriers has been carried out in many medium- and high-risk areas for the spread of the virus. Recently, anal swabs for key population screening have been shown to not only reduce missed diagnoses but also facilitate the traceability of infectious sources. As a specimen for the detection of viruses, the goal of this paper is to briefly review the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 and the necessity of using anal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 screening to minimize transmission and a threat to other people with COVID-19.","Wang, Yuliang; Chen, Xiaobo; Wang, Feng; Geng, Jie; Liu, Bingxu; Han, Feng",Int J Med Sci,,665

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks for prevention of influenza by collecting randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMbase and The Cochrane Library from the inception to January 27, 2020 to identify relevant systematic reviews. The RCTs included in systematic reviews were identified. Then we searched the latest published RCTs from the above three databases and searched ClinicalTrials.gov for unpublished RCTs. Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted to calculate pooled estimates by using RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: A total of six RCTs involving 9 171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza (RR = 1.09, 95% CI 0.92-1.28, P > .05), laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections (RR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.70-1.11), laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.42-1.29) and influenzalike illness (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.33-1.14) using N95 respirators and surgical masks. Meta-analysis indicated a protective effect of N95 respirators against laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.78). CONCLUSION: The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza. It suggests that N95 respirators should not be recommended for general public and nonhigh-risk medical staff those are not in close contact with influenza patients or suspected patients.","Long, Youlin; Hu, Tengyue; Liu, Liqin; Chen, Rui; Guo, Qiong; Yang, Liu; Cheng, Yifan; Huang, Jin; Du, Liang",J Evid Based Med,,665

This case described a patient who remained symptomatic several weeks after discharge from hospital with what was diagnosed as a COVID-19 infection. There were significant deficits shown in his functional exercise testing, his pulmonary functions testing and there was evidence of fibrotic changes on his radiology. METHODS: As part of a multidisciplinary clinic, he was started on steroids and a tailored pulmonary rehabilitation course over a course of 6-8 weeks. Thereafter, his exercise testing, pulmonary function tests and radiology were all repeated to see progress. RESULTS: On completing the course of corticosteroids and concurrent personalised pulmonary rehabilitation, there was a dramatic improvement in the patient's symptom severity, radiology and pulmonary function. The most significant improvement noted was in his exercise testing, namely a 6-min walk test and 1 min of sit-to-stands. Before treatment, he had a Medical Reserch Council (MRC) score of 2, and after it returned to his baseline of 0. DISCUSSION: Using corticosteroids and exercise training that allowed quantitative evaluation throughout the stages of recovery was a valuable tool to gauge progress and response to treatment. These therapies present opportunity to prevent the development of irreversible pulmonary fibrosis that could prove to be a major breakthrough in reducing long-term morbidity and improving the quality of life of those affected.","Fanshawe, Jack; Howell, Jack; Omar, Adhnan; Piper, Megan; Simpson, Thomas",Physiother Res Int,,665

Since antibacterial cleaning products have the capacity to change the environmental microbiome, increased exposure to household disinfectants could be associated with alterations in human microbiota composition and function. Moreover, the emerging links between household cleaning products and occurrence of non-communicable diseases and antibiotic resistance may involve the gut microbiome. The mediating effects of disturbed gut microbiota on associations between home use of cleaning products and life-long health consequences have been documented in some observational studies. Regarding the evidence associated reduction in exposure to non-pathogenic commensal bacteria and gut dysbiosis, further study is required to assess the effect of massive use of cleaning products during COVID-19 pandemic on long-term host health mediated by the altered microbiota. In this context, recommendations to consume probiotics and fermented foods might reverse the consequences by alleviating dysbiosis.","Ejtahed, Hanieh-Sadat; Hasani-Ranjbar, Shirin; Siadat, Seyed Davar; Larijani, Bagher",J Diabetes Metab Disord,,665

The role of competing risks,2020,"CONTEXT.­: Declining reimbursement shifts hospital laboratories from system assets to cost centers. This has resulted in increased outsourcing of laboratory services, which can jeopardize a hospital systems' ability to respond to a health care crisis. OBJECTIVES.­: To demonstrate that investment in a core laboratory serving an academic medical center equipped a regional health system to respond to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. DESIGN.­: COVID-19 diagnostic testing data were analyzed. Volumes were evaluated by result date (March 16, 2020-May 6, 2020), and the average of received-to-verified turnaround time was calculated and compared for in-house and send-out testing, and different in-house testing methodologies. RESULTS.­: Daily viral diagnostic testing capacity increased by greater than 3000% (from 21 tests per day to 658 tests per day). Total viral diagnostic testing reported by the core laboratory increased by 128 times during 22 days of test method validation and 826 times during the analysis period, while average turnaround time per day for send-out testing increased from 3.7 days to 21 days. Decreased overall average turnaround time was observed at the core laboratory (0.45 days) versus send-out testing (7.63 days) (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS.­: Investment in a core laboratory provided the health system with the necessary expertise and resources to mount a robust response to the pandemic. Local access to testing allowed rapid triage of patients and conservation of scarce personal protective equipment (PPE). In addition, the core laboratory was able to support regional health departments and several hospitals outside of the system.","Paczos, Tamera A",Arch Pathol Lab Med,,665

600499,A Review of Orthopaedic Resident Case Logs to Identify Fluctuations in Exposure to Adult Orthopaedic Procedures,2021-09-07,"Face masks have globally been accepted to be an effective protective tool to prevent bacterial and viral transmission, especially against indoor aerosol transmission. However, commercial face masks contain filters that are made of materials that are not capable of inactivating either SARS-CoV-2 or multidrug-resistant bacteria. Therefore, symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals can infect other people even if they wear them because some viable viral or bacterial loads can escape from the masks. Furthermore, viral or bacterial contact transmission can occur after touching the mask, which constitutes an increasing source of contaminated biological waste. Additionally, bacterial pathogens contribute to the SARS-CoV-2-mediated pneumonia disease complex, and their resistance to antibiotics in pneumonia treatment is increasing at an alarming rate. In this regard, herein, we report the development of a non-woven face mask filter fabricated with a biofunctional coating of benzalkonium chloride that is capable of inactivating more than 99% of SARS-CoV-2 particles in one minute of contact, and the life-threatening methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (normalized antibacterial halos of 0.52 ± 0.04 and 0.72 ± 0.04, respectively). Nonetheless, despite the results obtained, further studies are needed to ensure the safety and correct use of this technology for the mass production and commercialization of this broad-spectrum antimicrobial face mask filter. Our novel protective non-woven face mask filter would be useful for many healthcare workers and researchers working in this urgent and challenging field.","Martí, Miguel; Tuñón-Molina, Alberto; Aachmann, Finn Lillelund; Muramoto, Yukiko; Noda, Takeshi; Takayama, Kazuo; Serrano-Aroca, Ángel",Polymers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/polym13020207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33435608/,665

While the risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been extensively studied, these have been seldom compared with uninfected referents. Methods: We analyzed 341,166 White/Black male veterans tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 1 to September 10, 2020. The relative risk of 30-day mortality was computed for age, race, ethnicity, BMI, smoking status, and alcohol use disorder in infected and uninfected subjects separately. The difference in relative risk was then evaluated between infected and uninfected subjects. All the analyses were performed considering clinical confounders. Results: In this cohort, 7% were SARS-CoV-2-positive. Age >60 and overweight/obesity were associated with a dose-related increased mortality risk among infected patients relative to those uninfected. In contrast, relative to never smoking, current smoking was associated with a decreased mortality among infected and an increased mortality in uninfected, yielding a reduced mortality risk among infected relative to uninfected. Alcohol use disorder was also associated with decreased mortality risk in infected relative to the uninfected. Conclusions: Age, BMI, smoking, and alcohol use disorder affect 30-day mortality in SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects differently from uninfected referents. Advanced age and overweight/obesity were associated with increased mortality risk among infected men, while current smoking and alcohol use disorder were associated with lower mortality risk among infected men, when compared with those uninfected.","Suzuki, Ayako; Efird, Jimmy T.; Redding, Thomas S.; Thompson, Andrew D.; Press, Ashlyn M.; Williams, Christina D.; Hostler, Christopher J.; Hunt, Christine M.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444232/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168486,665

The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein has been considered critical for this interaction and acts as the target of numerous neutralizing antibodies and antiviral peptides. This study used the fragment molecular orbital method to analyze the interactions between the RBD and antibodies/peptides and extracted crucial residues that can be used as epitopes. The interactions evaluated as interfragment interaction energy values between the RBD and 12 antibodies/peptides showed a fairly good correlation with the experimental activity pIC(50) (R(2) = 0.540). Nine residues (T415, K417, Y421, F456, A475, F486, N487, N501, and Y505) were confirmed as being crucial. Pair interaction energy decomposition analyses showed that hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and π-orbital interactions are important.

623148,Consistency of recommendations from clinical practice guidelines for the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients,2020-07-31,"BACKGROUND: Pandemics and the large-scale outbreak of infectious disease can significantly impact morbidity and mortality worldwide. The impact on intensive care resources can be significant and often require modification of service delivery, a key element which includes rapid expansion of the critical care workforce. Pandemics are also unpredictable, which necessitates rapid decision-making and action which, in the lack of experience and guidance, may be extremely challenging. Recognising the potential strain on intensive care units (ICUs), particularly on staffing, a working group was formed for the purpose of developing recommendations to support decision-making during rapid service expansion. METHODS: The Critical Care Pandemic Staffing Working Party (n = 21), representing nursing, allied health, and medical disciplines, has used a modified consensus approach to provide recommendations to inform multidisciplinary workforce capacity expansion planning in critical care. RESULTS: A total of 60 recommendations have been proposed which reflect general recommendations as well as those specific to maintaining the critical care workforce, expanding the critical care workforce, rostering and allocation of the critical care workforce, nurse-specific recommendations for staffing the ICU, education support and training during ICU surge situations, workforce support, models of care, and de-escalation. CONCLUSION: These recommendations are provided with the intent that they be used to guide interdisciplinary decision-making, and we suggest that careful consideration is given to the local context to determine which recommendations are most appropriate to implement and how they are prioritised. Ongoing evaluation of recommendation implementation and impact will be necessary, particularly in rapidly changing clinical contexts.","Marshall, Andrea P.; Austin, Danielle E.; Chamberlain, Di; Chapple, Lee-anne S.; Cree, Michele; Fetterplace, Kate; Foster, Michelle; Freeman–Sanderson, Amy; Fyfe, Rachel; Grealy, Bernadette A.; Hodak, Alison; Holley, Anthony; Kruger, Peter; Kucharski, Geraldine; Pollock, Wendy; Ridley, Emma; Stewart, Penny; Thomas, Peter; Torresi, Kym; Williams, Linda",Aust Crit Care,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1036731420303003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33039301/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1036731420303003; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aucc.2020.08.007,665

Here, we compared a variety of replication features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and analysed the cytopathology caused by the two closely related viruses in the commonly used Vero E6 cell line. Compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 generated higher levels of intracellular viral RNA, but strikingly about 50-fold less infectious viral progeny was recovered from the culture medium. Immunofluorescence microscopy of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells established extensive cross-reactivity of antisera previously raised against a variety of non-structural proteins, membrane and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV. Electron microscopy revealed that the ultrastructural changes induced by the two SARS viruses are very similar and occur within comparable time frames after infection. Furthermore, we determined that the sensitivity of the two viruses to three established inhibitors of coronavirus replication (remdesivir, alisporivir and chloroquine) is very similar, but that SARS-CoV-2 infection was substantially more sensitive to pre-treatment of cells with pegylated interferon alpha. An important difference between the two viruses is the fact that – upon passaging in Vero E6 cells – SARS-CoV-2 apparently is under strong selection pressure to acquire adaptive mutations in its spike protein gene. These mutations change or delete a putative furin-like cleavage site in the region connecting the S1 and S2 domains and result in a very prominent phenotypic change in plaque assays.","Ogando, Natacha S.; Dalebout, Tim J.; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C.; Limpens, Ronald W.A.L.; van der Meer, Yvonne; Caly, Leon; Druce, Julian; de Vries, Jutte J.

METHODS: A retrospective, mixed-methods analysis of a Family Liaison Team (FLT) formed by redeployed clinicians during the first surge of the 2020 COVID 19 pandemic. RESULTS: The FLT was constituted predominantly of non-ICU consultants (30/39, 77%). Following two 1-hourly webinars around basic communication skills, the FLT facilitated over 12,000 video and telephone calls with 172 patients’ family and friends (PFF). The majority of the PFF interviewed were mostly, very or extremely satisfied by the frequency, ease, understanding, honesty, completeness and consistency of the information provided. Approximately 5% of the interviewees, reported to be slightly or very dissatisfied in one or more of the following 3 categories: frequency, consistency and ease of getting the information. The thematic analysis identified 3 themes: 1) being there/ for the patient; 2) breakdown in communication; 3) disbelief at the speed of deterioration. In 14.9% of cases there was documented discrepancy between the information transmitted by the CC team and that by the FLT, particularly around the severity of the patient's illness and their imminent death. CONCLUSIONS: The formation of a dedicated FLT was feasible and associated with increased levels of satisfaction by the PFF. Friction was created when communication was not consistent and didn't convey the severity of the patient's condition, in order to prepare the PFF for a bad outcome.","Lopez-Soto, C.; Bates, E.; Anderson, C.; Saha, S.; Adams, L.; Aulakh, A.; Bowtell, F.; Buckel, M.; Emms, T.; Shebl, M.; Metaxa, V.",J Pain Symptom Manage,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885392421003055?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2021.04.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33892123/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0885392421003055,665

Chest computed tomography angiography (CTa) showed bilateral peripheral ground-glass opacifications classified as CO-RADS 5, but no pulmonary embolism. To analyze the possibility of CTaundetectable pulmonary microthrombi and to rule out cardiac perfusion abnormalities, we decided to perform a rubidium-82 (82Rb) PET/CT. 82Rb PET/CT imaging in this patient yielded uptake in the pulmonary areas of ground-glass opacification and showed. Moreover, higher 82Rb uptake was shown in the lobe with the highest density on CT. The ejection fraction was normal (56%) and no pulmonary embolism or other defects were detected. To our knowledge, this is the first time 82Rb PET/CT was performed for suspected pulmonary microthrombi in a COVID-19 patient. This case report shows corresponding findings between 82Rb PET/CT and CTa imaging without and does not show any signs of microthrombi despite the elevated d-dimer. Even in the Response to Reviewers (without Author Details) areas of profound groundglass opacifications, the increased 82Rb uptake indicates that perfusion is adequate to acquire 82Rb uptake in the de pulmonary cells. 82Rb PET/CT is a promising imaging technique and might extend the diagnostic potential of conventional nuclear and radiological imaging imaging techniques as CTa in detecting pulmonary microthrombi or other minor perfusion defects. To show sufficient evidence for the use of 82Rb PET/CT in clinical practice for COVID-19, validation should take place in a future prospective clinical trial, studying a large patient cohort.","de Burgt, Alina van; Smit, Frits; Anten, Sander",Radiol Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34422149/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radcr.2021.08.027; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1930043321005963?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1930043321005963,665

658507,Contrôle des épidémies de COVID-19 : la leçon de l'Islam,2020-07-04,"BACKGROUND: Financial incentives are an effective way of helping women to stop smoking during pregnancy. Unfortunately, most women who stop smoking at this time return to smoking within 12 months of the infant’s birth. There is no evidence for interventions that are effective at preventing postpartum smoking relapse. Financial incentives provided after the birth may help women to sustain cessation. This randomised controlled trial will assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of financial incentives to help women who are abstinent from smoking at end-of-pregnancy to avoid return to smoking up to 12 months postpartum. METHODS: This is a UK-based, multi-centre, three-arm, superiority, parallel group, individually randomised controlled trial, with 1:1:1 allocation. It will compare the effectiveness of two financial incentive interventions with each other (one intervention for up to 3 months postpartum offering up to £120 of incentives (£60 for the participant and £60 for a significant other support); the other for up to 12 months postpartum with up to £300 of incentives (£240 for the participant and £60 for a significant other support) and with a no incentives/usual care control group. Eligible women will be between 34 weeks gestation and 2 weeks postpartum, abstinent from smoking for at least 4 weeks, have an expired carbon monoxide (CO) reading < 4 parts per million (ppm), aged at least 16 years, intend remaining abstinent from smoking after the birth and able to speak and read English. The primary outcome is self-reported, lapse-free, smoking abstinence from the last quit attempt in pregnancy until 12 months postpartum, biochemically validated by expired CO and/or salivary cotinine or anabasine. Outcomes will be analysed by intention-to-treat and regression models used to compare the proportion of abstinent women between the two intervention groups and between each intervention group and the control group. An economic evaluation will assess the cost-effectiveness of offering incentives and a qualitative process evaluation will examine barriers and facilitators to trial retention, effectiveness and implementation. DISCUSSION: This pragmatic randomised controlled trial will test whether offering financial incentives is effective and cost-effective for helping women to avoid smoking relapse during the 12 months after the birth of their baby.

The infliction of socially organized mass violence and the suppression of reporting of harms has an impact on multiple levels: the individual, the familial, and the social. Ignacio Martín Baró, a Jesuit priest and social psychologist, explored the impact of psychosocial trauma while living and dying in the 1980–1992 Salvadoran civil war. His depiction of the multilevel impact of atrocity provides insight into the connection between health and human rights. This article discusses how his analysis of the constituent parts of psychosocial trauma continues to hold relevance for understanding the legacy of historical events and points to possibilities for mitigating health harm in various contemporary contexts.","Simalchik, Joan",Health Hum Rights,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34194198/,665
