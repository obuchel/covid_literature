146,146,146,"Can ""presumed consent"" justify the duty to treat infectious diseases? An analysis",13.640118,10.973816,2008-03-06,"BACKGROUND: AIDS, SARS, and the recent epidemics of the avian-flu have all served to remind us the debate over the limits of the moral duty to care. It is important to first consider the question of whether or not the ""duty to treat"" might be subject to contextual constraints. The purpose of this study was to investigate the opinions and beliefs held by both physicians and dentists regarding the occupational risks of infectious diseases, and to analyze the argument that the notion of ""presumed consent"" on the part of professionals may be grounds for supporting the duty to treat. METHODS: For this cross-sectional survey, the study population was selected from among physicians and dentists in Ankara. All of the 373 participants were given a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 79.6% of the participants said that they either had some degree of knowledge about the risks when they chose their profession or that they learned of the risks later during their education and training. Of the participants, 5.2% said that they would not have chosen this profession if they had been informed of the risks. It was found that 57% of the participants believed that there is a standard level of risk, and 52% of the participants stated that certain diseases would exceed the level of acceptable risk unless specific protective measures were implemented. CONCLUSION: If we use the presumed consent argument to establish the duty of the HCW to provide care, we are confronted with problems ranging over the difficulty of choosing a profession autonomously, the constant level of uncertainty present in the medical profession, the near-impossibility of being able to evaluate retrospectively whether every individual was informed, and the seemingly inescapable problem that this practice would legitimize, and perhaps even foster, discrimination against patients with certain diseases. Our findings suggest that another problem can be added to the list: one-fifth of the participants in this study either lacked adequate knowledge of the occupational risks when they chose the medical profession or were not sufficiently informed of these risks during their faculty education and training. Furthermore, in terms of the moral duty to provide care, it seems that most HCWs are more concerned about the availability of protective measures than about whether they had been informed of a particular risk beforehand. For all these reasons, the presumed consent argument is not persuasive enough, and cannot be used to justify the duty to provide care. It is therefore more useful to emphasize justifications other than presumed consent when defining the duty of HCWs to provide care, such as the social contract between society and the medical profession and the fact that HCWs have a greater ability to provide medical aid.","Civaner, Murat; Arda, Berna",BMC Infect Dis,90,3

HBoV was detected in NPAs of 1 (0.8%) of 126 symptomatic adults, 31 (13.8%) of 225 symptomatic children, and 43 (43%) of 100 asymptomatic children undergoing elective surgery. Another virus was detected in 22 (71%) of the 31 HBoV-positive NPAs from symptomatic children. Two clades of HBoV were identified. The pathogenic role of HBoV in RTIs is uncertain because it was frequently detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic children and was commonly found with other viruses in symptomatic children.","Longtin, Jean; Bastien, Martine; Gilca, Rodica; Leblanc, Eric; de Serres, Gaston; Bergeron, Michel G.; Boivin, Guy",Emerg Infect Dis,90,3

Overall, 79 (17.7%) of 446 had a positive antibody titer by hemagglutination inhibition, with 46 (19.9%) of 231 HCWs and 33 (15.3%) of 215 controls positive (OR 1.37, 95% confidence interval 0.84–2.22). Of 87 participants who provided a second serum sample, 1 showed a 4-fold rise in antibody titer; of 45 patients who had a nose swab sample taken during a respiratory illness, 7 had positive results. Higher numbers of children in a participant’s family and working in an intensive care unit were risk factors for infection; increasing age, working at hospital 2, and wearing gloves were protective factors. This highly exposed group of frontline HCWs was no more likely to contract pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza infection than nonclinical staff, which suggests that personal protective measures were adequate in preventing transmission.","Marshall, Caroline; Kelso, Anne; McBryde, Emma; Barr, Ian G.; Eisen, Damon P.; Sasadeusz, Joe; Buising, Kirsty; Cheng, Allen C.; Johnson, Paul; Richards, Michael",Emerg Infect Dis,90,3

1592,1592,1592,Associations of hand-washing frequency with incidence of acute respiratory tract infection and influenza-like illness in adults: a population-based study in Sweden,13.708441,10.976696,2014-09-18,"BACKGROUND: Frequent hand-washing is standard advice for avoidance of respiratory tract infections, but the evidence for a preventive effect in a general community setting is sparse. We therefore set out to quantify, in a population-based adult general population cohort, the possible protection against acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) conferred by a person’s self-perceived hand-washing frequency. METHODS: During the pandemic influenza season from September 2009 through May 2010, a cohort of 4365 adult residents of Stockholm County, Sweden, reported respiratory illnesses in real-time. A questionnaire about typical contact and hand-washing behaviour was administered at the end of the period (response rate 70%). RESULTS: There was no significant decrease in ARI rates among adults with increased daily hand-washing frequency: Compared to 2–4 times/day, 5–9 times was associated with an adjusted ARI rate ratio (RR) of 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-1.33), 10–19 times with RR = 1.22 (CI 0.97-1.53), and ≥20 times with RR = 1.03 (CI 0.81-1.32). A similar lack of effect was seen for influenza-like illness, and in all investigated subgroups. We found no clear effect modification by contact behaviour. Health care workers exhibited rate ratio point estimates below unity, but no dose-risk trend. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that increases in what adult laymen perceive as being adequate hand-washing may not significantly reduce the risk of ARIs. This might have implications for the design of public health campaigns in the face of threatening outbreaks of respiratory infections. However, the generalizability of our results to non-pandemic circumstances should be further explored.

2523,2523,2523,Stochastic modelling of infectious diseases for heterogeneous populations,13.590267,10.915861,2016-12-22,"BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases such as SARS and H1N1 can significantly impact people’s lives and cause severe social and economic damages. Recent outbreaks have stressed the urgency of effective research on the dynamics of infectious disease spread. However, it is difficult to predict when and where outbreaks may emerge and how infectious diseases spread because many factors affect their transmission, and some of them may be unknown. METHODS: One feasible means to promptly detect an outbreak and track the progress of disease spread is to implement surveillance systems in regional or national health and medical centres. The accumulated surveillance data, including temporal, spatial, clinical, and demographic information can provide valuable information that can be exploited to better understand and model the dynamics of infectious disease spread. The aim of this work is to develop and empirically evaluate a stochastic model that allows the investigation of transmission patterns of infectious diseases in heterogeneous populations. RESULTS: We test the proposed model on simulation data and apply it to the surveillance data from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong. In the simulation experiment, our model achieves high accuracy in parameter estimation (less than 10.0 % mean absolute percentage error). In terms of the forward prediction of case incidence, the mean absolute percentage errors are 17.3 % for the simulation experiment and 20.0 % for the experiment on the real surveillance data. CONCLUSION: We propose a stochastic model to study the dynamics of infectious disease spread in heterogeneous populations from temporal-spatial surveillance data. The proposed model is evaluated using both simulated data and the real data from the 2009 H1N1 epidemic in Hong Kong and achieves acceptable prediction accuracy. We believe that our model can provide valuable insights for public health authorities to predict the effect of disease spread and analyse its underlying factors and to guide new control efforts.

We have characterized a 113-kDa immunogenic protein, PF3D7_1431400 (PF14_0293), that possesses coiled-coil structures. The protein is localized on the surfaces of both merozoites and gametocytes, hence the name Plasmodium falciparum surface-related antigen (PfSRA). The processed 32-kDa fragment of PfSRA binds normal human erythrocytes with different sensitivities to enzyme treatments. Temporal imaging from initial attachment to internalization of viable merozoites revealed that a fragment of PfSRA, along with PfMSP1(19,) is internalized after invasion. Moreover, parasite growth inhibition assays showed that PfSRA P1 antibodies potently inhibited erythrocyte invasion of both sialic acid–dependent and –independent parasite strains. Also, immunoepidemiological studies show that malaria-infected populations have naturally acquired antibodies against PfSRA. Overall, the results demonstrate that PfSRA has the structural and functional characteristics of a very promising target for vaccine development.","Amlabu, Emmanuel; Mensah-Brown, Henrietta; Nyarko, Prince B; Akuh, Ojo-ajogu; Opoku, Grace; Ilani, Philip; Oyagbenro, Richard; Asiedu, Kwame; Aniweh, Yaw; Awandare, Gordon A",J Infect Dis,90,3

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of ACE2 overexpression in the RVLM on cholinergic synaptic transmission in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Four weeks after injecting lentiviral particles containing enhanced green fluorescent protein and ACE2 bilaterally into the RVLM, the blood pressure and heart rate were notably decreased. ACE2 overexpression significantly reduced the concentration of acetylcholine in microdialysis fluid from the RVLM and blunted the decrease in blood pressure evoked by bilateral injection of atropine into the RVLM in SHRs. In conclusion, we suggest that ACE2 overexpression in the RVLM attenuates the enhanced cholinergic synaptic transmission in SHRs.","Deng, Yu; Tan, Xing; Li, Miao-Ling; Wang, Wei-Zhong; Wang, Yang-Kai",Neurosci Bull,90,1

Surprisingly, little is known about antibiotic use in children as compared to adults with RTI. This prospective study aimed to determine antibiotic misuse in children and adults with RTI, using an expert panel reference standard, in order to prioritise the target age population for antibiotic stewardship interventions. We recruited children and adults who presented at the emergency department or were hospitalised with clinical presentation of RTI in The Netherlands and Israel. A panel of three experienced physicians adjudicated a reference standard diagnosis (i.e. bacterial or viral infection) for all the patients using all available clinical and laboratory information, including a 28-day follow-up assessment. The cohort included 284 children and 232 adults with RTI (median age, 1.3 years and 64.5 years, respectively). The proportion of viral infections was larger in children than in adults (209(74%) versus 89(38%), p < 0.001). In case of viral RTI, antibiotics were prescribed (i.e. overuse) less frequently in children than in adults (77/209 (37%) versus 74/89 (83%), p < 0.001). One (1%) child and three (2%) adults with bacterial infection were not treated with antibiotics (i.e. underuse); all were mild cases. This international, prospective study confirms major antibiotic overuse in patients with RTI. Viral infection is more common in children, but antibiotic overuse is more frequent in adults with viral RTI. Together, these findings support the need for effective interventions to decrease antibiotic overuse in RTI patients of all ages.

No evidence of genetic association,13.46429,11.286261,2016-08-04,"Nosocomial pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) causes considerable morbidity and mortality. It is the second most common nosocomial infection and the leading cause of death from hospital-acquired infections. In 1996 the American Thoracic Society (ATS) published guidelines for empirical therapy of HAP. This review focuses on the literature that has appeared since the ATS statement. Early diagnosis of HAP and its etiology is crucial in guiding empirical therapy. Since 1996, it has become clear that differentiating mere colonization from etiologic pathogens infecting the lower respiratory tract is best achieved by employing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or protected specimen brush (PSB) in combination with quantitative culture and detection of intracellular microorganisms. Endotracheal aspirate and non-bronchoscopic BAL/PSB in combination with quantitative culture provide a good alternative in patients suspected of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Since culture results take 2–3 days, initial therapy of HAP is by definition empirical. Epidemiologic studies have identified the most frequently involved pathogens: Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus (‘core pathogens’). Empirical therapy covering only the ‘core pathogens’ will suffice in patients without risk factors for resistant microorganisms. Studies that have appeared since the ATS statement issued in 1996, demonstrate several new risk factors for HAP with multiresistant pathogens. In patients with risk factors, empirical therapy should consist of antibacterials with a broader spectrum. The most important risk factors for resistant microorganisms are late onset of HAP (≥5 days after admission), recent use of antibacterial therapy, and mechanical ventilation. Multiresistant bacteria of specific interest are methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus- baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Each of these organisms has its specific susceptibility pattern, demanding appropriate antibacterial treatment. To further improve outcomes, specific therapeutic options for multiresistant pathogens and pharmacological factors are discussed. Antibacterials developed since 1996 or antibacterials with renewed interest (linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, meropenem, new fluoroquinolones, and fourth-generation cephalosporins) are discussed in the light of developing resistance. Since the ATS statement, many reports have shown increasing incidences of resistant microorganisms. Therefore, one of the most important conclusions from this review is that empirical therapy for HAP should not be based on general guidelines alone, but that local epidemiology should be taken into account and used in the formulation of local guidelines.","Andriesse, Gunnar I.; Verhoef, Jan",Treat Respir Med,90,3

METHODS: Retrospective review of case sheets was done. One hundred ten patients with invasive meningococcal disease were included for the study. RESULTS: Of the total patients, 61.8 % were boys and 38.2 % were girls (boy to girl ratio = 1.62:1). The average age of presentation was 8.48 ± 5.09 y. Meningococcal meningitis was seen in 61.8 % of cases, meningococcemia in 20 % and 18.2 % had both.

No deaths were observed among the 389 RIDT-positive patients. Although the spread of influenza A virus was both rapid and extensive, mainly among children under the age of 18, it seemed to be mild. Appropriate interpretation of the RIDT on the basis of recent clinical information, and early treatment with antiviral drugs might help to prevent severe illness from influenza pandemics in the future.","Takayama, Koji; Kuramochi, Jin; Oinuma, Takeshi; Kaneko, Hiromi; Kurasawa, Satoshi; Yasui, Makito; Okayasu, Kaori; Ono, Hiroshi; Inase, Naohiko",J Infect Chemother,90,3

Various extracellular and intracellular events affect the ability of the cell to efflux excess cholesterol. To explore the possible pathways and processes that promote or inhibit cholesterol efflux, we applied a combined cheminformatic and bioinformatic approach. We performed a comprehensive analysis of published data on the various substances influencing cholesterol efflux and found 153 low molecular weight substances that are included in the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database. Pathway enrichment was performed for substances identified within the Reactome database, and 45 substances were selected in 93 significant pathways. The most common pathways included the energy-dependent processes related to active cholesterol transport from the cell, lipoprotein metabolism and lipid transport, and signaling pathways. The activators and inhibitors of cholesterol efflux were non-uniformly distributed among the different pathways: the substances influencing ‘biological oxidations’ activate cholesterol efflux and the substances influencing ‘Signaling by GPCR and PTK6’ inhibit efflux. This analysis may be used in the search and design of efflux effectors for therapies targeting structural and functional high-density lipoprotein deficiency.","Litvinov, Dmitry Y.; Savushkin, Eugeny V.; Dergunov, Alexander D.",Pharmaceut Med,90,3

The activity of natural killer cells and the serum concentrations of interleuin-2, interleukin-6 and TNF-α were measured in 12 cases of transmediastinal dissection and 10 cases of transthioracic en bloc esophageal resection and compared to values of a control group of thoracic and abdominal surgical patients with non-malignant maladies. Natural killer cells assume a central role in the non-specific immunological response in tumor patients. Their main function is the destruction of tumor cells via cytotoxic activities amplified by the release of interleukin-2 and TNF-α. Natural killer cell activity was measured prior to surgery and on postoperative days 4 and 10 using a standardized europium chloride release assay, utilizing K 562 target cells. Lymphokines interleukin-2, interleukin-6, and THF-α were also measured on postoperative days 1 and 7 using standardized ELISA assays. The activity of natural killer cells in our patient group sank significantly (P<0.05) on postoperative day 4 and likewise in the control group and both study groups, activity sank to the original values. In the control groups, natural killer cell activity averaged 45% of preoperative values, in comparison with an average of 63% following transmediastinal esophageal carcinoma resection (one cavity procedure), and transthoracic en bloc resection patients only reached 61% of preoperative values, transmediastinal dissection patients assumed 75%, and 77% was achieved by control group members. Transthoracic en bloc resection of the esophagus led to a more extreme reduction in cytotoxic cellular activity owing to the greater surgical trauma. Suppression of the immunological tumor resistance, especially in the vulnerable perisurgical pahse, can have an indirect negative effect on the manifestation risk of hematogenic metastases owing to intraoperative tumor cell dissemination resulting from tumor manipulation and may thus be prognostically relevant.","Bruns, Ch.; Schäfer, H.; Wolfgarten, B.; Pichlmaier, H.",Langenbecks Arch Chir,90,3

Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) can be a curative treatment for ATL, a significant proportion of allo-HSCT recipients suffer from relapse/progression of ATL. Here we aimed to clarify the risk factors for and outcomes after posttransplant relapse/progression. We retrospectively reviewed 76 patients with ATL who received allo-HSCT at our institute. At the time of allo-HSCT, disease status was complete response in 17 patients, partial response in 29, stable disease (SD) in 18, and progressive disease (PD) in 12. In multivariate analysis, SD/PD at allo-HSCT, lymphoma subtype, reduced-intensity conditioning regimen, and time from diagnosis to allo-HSCT were associated with risk of relapse/progression. After allo-HSCT, 26 patients had relapse/progression at a median of 66 days (range, 13–2064 days). The 2-year overall survival rate after relapse/progression was only 19%. Compared with acute-type, lymphoma-type experienced local recurrence more frequently (1/15 acute vs. 7/11 lymphoma, P < 0.01) and had a significantly longer OS after relapse/progression (median; 112 days in acute vs. 554 days in lymphoma, P < 0.01). Since the prognosis of patients with ATL who experienced relapse/progression after allo-HSCT was poor, strategies to reduce the risk of these outcomes are warranted.","Inoue, Yoshitaka; Fuji, Shigeo; Tanosaki, Ryuji; Inamoto, Yoshihiro; Tanaka, Takashi; Ito, Ayumu; Okinaka, Keiji; Kurosawa, Saiko; Kim, Sung-Won; Nakagama, Hitoshi; Fukuda, Takahiro",Bone Marrow Transplant,90,3

Neutralizing this exaggerated immune response by monoclonal antibodies (anti-TNF-α), receptor antagonists (IL-1rα) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) did not result in a better outcome in septic patients. Firstly, this is due to the short biological half-lives of these natural antagonists or inhibitors of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Secondly, exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine production may contribute to pathology in one body compartment while, simultaneously, the same mediators may have beneficial effects in another compartment. Thus, systemic administration of cytokine inhibitors at levels sufficient to neutralize exaggerated cytokine production in one organ may also block the presumably beneficial aspects of cytokine production in another. Methods: Our own results of animal experiments of the liposome mediated gene transfer are presented. Results: Liposome mediated gene transfer seems to be a promising low-risk alternative to systemic anti-inflammatory therapies as it ensures the local delivery of high doses of cytokine inhibitors and antagonists over a prolonged period of time. Conclusions: The pathophysiological mechanism of sepsis and septic shock are well established. The concept of local intervention or compartimental blockade of overwhelming mediator production by gene transfer will be a new challenge in the future.","Rogy, M. A.; Beinhauer, B.

An array-based resequencing (ABR) assay was developed to facilitate genetic testing in HCM. Methods: An Affymetrix resequencing array and a single long-range PCR protocol were developed to cover the 3 most commonly affected genes in HCM, MYH7 (myosin, heavy chain 7, cardiac muscle, beta), MYBPC3 (myosin binding protein C, cardiac), and TNNT2 [troponin T type 2 (cardiac)]. Results: The assay detected the underlying point mutation in 23 of 24 reference samples and provided pointers toward identifying a G insertion and a 3-bp deletion. The comparability of array-based assay results to conventional capillary sequencing was ≥99.9%. Both techniques detected 1 heterozygous variant that was missed by the other method. Conclusions: The data provide evidence that ABR can substantially reduce the high workload previously associated with a genetic test for HCM. Therefore, the HCM array could facilitate large-scale studies aimed at broadening the understanding of the genetic and phenotypic diversity of HCM and related cardiomyopathies.","Waldmüller, Stephan; Müller, Melanie; Rackebrandt, Kirsten; Binner, Priska; Poths, Sven; Bonin, Michael; Scheffold, Thomas",Clin Chem,90,9

However, the respective contributions of various infected organs, and within these of pDCs, conventional dendritic cells and other cells, to the systemic production of IFN-α/β or other innate cytokines during viral infections in vivo is largely unknown. Whether a specialization of pDC subsets in the production of different patterns of innate cytokines exists in vivo in response to a viral infection has not been investigated. Here, by analyzing for the first time directly ex vivo, at the single-cell level, the simultaneous production of up to three cytokines in pDCs isolated from MCMV-infected mice, we show that (i) pDCs are the quasi-exclusive source of IFN-α/β, IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, early during MCMV infection, in two immunocompetent mouse lines and with two viral strains, (ii) pDC activation for IFN-α/β production is organ specific and (iii) a significant proportion of pDCs simultaneously produce IFN-α/β, TNF-α and IL-12, although TNF-α and IFN-α/β appear more often co-expressed with one another than each of them with IL-12. Altogether, these results show a broad and non-redundant role of pDCs in early innate detection of, and defense against, viral infection. The data also show differences in the responsiveness of pDCs from different tissues and suggest distinct molecular requirements for pDC production of various cytokines. These observations must be taken into account when designing new antiviral vaccination strategies aimed at harnessing pDC responses.","Zucchini, Nicolas; Bessou, Gilles; Robbins, Scott H.; Chasson, Lionel; Raper, Anna; Crocker, Paul R.; Dalod, Marc",Int Immunol,90,3

Male Fischer-344 rats were treated by gavage and hepatocytes were isolated by liver perfusion and cultured with [ (3) H]thymidine. UDS was measured by quantitative autoradiography as net grains/nucleus (NG); ≥5 NG was considered positive. Controls consistently had − 3 to − 6 NG. A dose-related increase in UDS was observed 12 h after treatment, with 200 mg/kg tgDNT producing 26 NG. A 50-fold increase in the number of cells in S-phase was observed at 48 h after treatment. This increase in S-phase cells could be suppressed in the presence of 10–20 mM hydroxyurea (HU), while the same levels of HU did not affect the level of UDS at 12 h after treatment. 2, 4-DNT produced only a weak response, in contrast to 2, 6-DNT which was a potent inducer of UDS. Treatment of female rats with tgDNT yielded only modest increases in UDS and DNA replication relative to males. These results are consistent with the carcinogenicity studies and indicate that tgDNT is a potent genotoxic agent, with 2, 6-DNT contributing the major portion of the effect.","Mirsalis, Jon C.; Butterworth, Byron E.",Carcinogenesis,90,3

However, the roles of a XO inhibitor, febuxostat (FEB), in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling and hypertension independent of the serum uric acid level remain unclear. METHODS: To induce vascular remodeling in mice, angiotensin II (Ang II) was infused for 2 weeks with a subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipump. FEB was administered every day during Ang II infusion. Aortic fibrosis was assessed by elastica van Gieson staining. Mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells (RAW) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were used for in vitro studies. RESULTS: FEB suppressed Ang II-induced blood pressure elevation and aortic fibrosis. Immunostaining showed that Ang II-induced macrophage infiltration in the aorta tended to be suppressed by FEB, and XO was mainly colocalized in macrophages, not in fibroblasts. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) mRNA expression was induced in the aorta in the Ang II alone group, but not in the Ang II + FEB group. Ang II induced α-smooth muscle actin-positive fibroblasts in the aortic wall, but FEB suppressed them. XO expression and activity were induced by Ang II stimulation alone but not by Ang II + FEB in RAW. FEB suppressed Ang II-induced TGF-β1 mRNA expression in RAW. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that FEB ameliorates Ang II-induced aortic fibrosis via suppressing macrophage-derived TGF-β1 expression.","Kondo, Masateru; Imanishi, Masaki; Fukushima, Keijo; Ikuto, Raiki; Murai, Yoichi; Horinouchi, Yuya; Izawa-Ishizawa, Yuki; Goda, Mitsuhiro; Zamami, Yoshito; Takechi, Kenshi; Chuma, Masayuki; Ikeda, Yasumasa; Fujino, Hiromichi; Tsuchiya, Koichiro; Ishizawa, Keisuke",Am J Hypertens,90,3

The lectin DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin) augments Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. However, it its unclear whether DC-SIGN promotes only EBOV attachment (attachment factor function, nonessential) or actively facilitates EBOV entry (receptor function, essential). Methods. We investigated whether DC-SIGN on B cell lines and dendritic cells acts as an EBOV attachment factor or receptor. Results. Engineered DC-SIGN expression rendered some B cell lines susceptible to EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV GP)-driven infection, whereas others remained refractory, suggesting that cellular factors other than DC-SIGN are also required for susceptibility to EBOV infection. Augmentation of entry was independent of efficient DCSIGN internalization and might not involve lectin-mediated endocytic uptake of virions. Therefore, DC-SIGN is unlikely to function as an EBOV receptor on B cell lines; instead, it might concentrate virions onto cells, thereby allowing entry into cell lines expressing low levels of endogenous receptor(s). Indeed, artificial concentration of virions onto cells mirrored DC-SIGN expression, confirming that optimization of viral attachment is sufficient for EBOV GP-driven entry into some B cell lines. Finally, EBOV infection of dendritic cells was only partially dependent on mannose-specific lectins, such as DC-SIGN, suggesting an important contribution of other factors. Conclusions. Our results indicate that DC-SIGN is not an EBOV receptor but, rather, is an attachmentpromoting factor that boosts entry into B cell lines susceptible to low levels of EBOV GP-mediated infection.","Marzi, Andrea; Möller, Peggy; Hanna, Sheri L.; Harrer, Thomas; Eisemann, Jutta; Steinkasserer, Alexander; Becker, Stephan; Baribaud, Frédéric; Pöhlmann, Stefan",J Infect Dis,90,3

The aim of this study was to elucidate the mbrABCD-related bacitracin resistance mechanism of S. mutans. Transcriptome data demonstrated that the expression levels of 33 genes were induced more than twofold by bacitracin. Fourteen genes were selected from the upregulated genes, and defective mutants of these genes were constructed for measurement of their sensitivity to bacitracin. Among the mutants, only the mbrA- or mbrB-deficient mutants exhibited 100- to 121-fold greater sensitivity to bacitracin when compared with the wild-type strain. Moreover, knockout of the mbrC and mbrD genes abolished the bacitracin-induced mbrAB upregulation. These results suggest that both mbrC and mbrD are required for mbrAB upregulation that confers the bacitracin-resistant phenotype on S. mutans.

Drug-eluting stenting (DES), including paclitaxel-eluting stenting (PES) and sirolimus-eluting stenting (SES), has been proven to have a lower restenotic rate. However, to date, few studies have investigated the clinical and angiographic results of DES in premature CAD patients. METHODS: Between February 2004 and October 2005, premature CAD patients, defined as those younger than 50 years ofage, who were treated with DES in our medical center were all retrospectively enrolled. Their baseline clinical characteristics, clinical outcome and angiographic follow-up results were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 26 patients (M/F: 23/3) were enrolled, with a mean age of 44 ±6 years (range, 24–50 years). Conventional atherosclerotic risk factors were prevalent in this study group, including diabetes mellitus (35%), hypertension (35%), hyperlipidemia (54%) and smoking (73%). Moreover, there was 1 homozygous and 1 heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia case in our study group. In terms of angiographic results, there were 40 target lesions in 34 target vessels. Forty DES (39 PES, 1 SES) were implanted with a median stent diameter of 3 mm and median length of 24 mm. The clinical follow-up was counted up to May 2006, with a mean follow-up duration of 540 ±168 days; 11 (42%) patients had a second angiogram during the follow-up period (200 ±98 days after DES). None of the patients had target lesion revascularization (TLR). In addition, there was no difference in TLR or stent thrombosis between patients with or without acute coronary syndrome.

Patients with ICP monitoring were compared to those without. A logistic regression was used to examine the risk of mortality. RESULTS: Of 3,808 patients, 685 (18.0%) underwent ICP monitoring. ICP monitors were associated with increased risk of mortality (OR 1.82, CI 1.36–2.44, p < 0.001). A secondary analysis including type of invasive ICP monitor and dividing GCS into 3 categories revealed both intraventricular drain (OR 1.89, CI 1.3–2.7, p = 0.001) and intraparenchymal pressure monitor (OR 1.86, CI 1.32–2.6, p < 0.001) to be independently associated with an increased likelihood of mortality regardless of GCS, while intraparenchymal oxygen monitoring was not (OR 0.47, CI 0.11–2.05, p = 0.316). The strongest effect was seen in those patients with a GCS of 5–6. CONCLUSION: ICP monitors are an independent risk factor for mortality, particularly with intraventricular drains and intraparenchymal monitors in patients with a GCS 5–6.","Delaplain, Patrick T.; Grigorian, Areg; Lekawa, Michael; Mallicote, Michael; Joe, Victor; Schubl, Sebastian D.; Kuza, Catherine M.; Dolich, Matthew; Nahmias, Jeffry",Pediatr Surg Int,90,3

In this review, we focus on proteomics, electron cryo-microscopy and structural modeling to showcase instances where affinity-purification (AP) and cross-linking (XL) mass spectrometry (MS) has advanced our understanding of host–pathogen interactions. We highlight cases where XL-MS in combination with structural modeling has provided insight into the quaternary structure of interspecies protein complexes. We further exemplify how electron cryo-tomography has been used to visualize bacterial–human interactions during attachment and infection. Lastly, we discuss how AP-MS, XL-MS and electron cryo-microscopy and -tomography together with structural modeling approaches can be used in future studies to broaden our knowledge regarding the function, dynamics and evolution of such interactions. This knowledge will be of relevance for future drug and vaccine development programs.","Chowdhury, Sounak; Happonen, Lotta; Khakzad, Hamed; Malmström, Lars; Malmström, Johan",Med Microbiol Immunol,90,3

Our objective was to develop a predictive analytic tool to identify emergency department (ED) patients that required upgrade to an intensive or intermediate care unit (ICU or IMU) within 24 h after being admitted to an acute care floor. We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study to identify ED patients that were admitted to an acute care unit and identified cases where the patient was upgraded to ICU or IMU within 24 h. We used data available at the time of admission to build a logistic regression model that predicts early ICU transfer. We found 42,332 patients admitted between January 2012 and December 2016. There were 496 cases (1.2%) of early ICU transfer. Case patients had 18.0-fold higher mortality (11.1% vs. 0.6%, p < 0.001) and 3.4 days longer hospital stays (5.9 vs. 2.5, p < 0.001) than those without an early transfer. Our predictive analytic model had a cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.70 (95% CI 0.67–0.72) and identified 10% of early ICU transfers with an alert rate of 1.6 per week (162.2 acute care admits per week, 1.9 early ICU transfers). Predictive analytic monitoring based on data available in the emergency department can identify patients that will require upgrade to ICU or IMU if admitted to acute care. Incorporating this tool into ED practice may draw attention to high-risk patients before acute care admit and allow early intervention.","Glass, George; Hartka, Thomas R.; Keim-Malpass, Jessica; Enfield, Kyle B.; Clark, Matthew T.",J Clin Monit Comput,90,3

Effective interventions promoting adherence are urgently needed. We reviewed and synthesized recent literature on interventions to improve ART adherence among this vulnerable population. We focus on studies conducted in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where the adolescent and youth HIV burden is greatest. Articles published between September 2015 and January 2019 were identified through PubMed. Inclusion criteria were: [1] included participants ages 10–24 years; [2] assessed the efficacy of an intervention to improve ART adherence; [3] reported an ART adherence measurement or viral load; [4] conducted in a LMIC. Articles were reviewed for study population characteristics, intervention type, study design, outcomes measured, and intervention effect. Strength of each study’s evidence was evaluated according to an adapted World Health Organization GRADE system. Articles meeting all inclusion criteria except being conducted in an LMIC were reviewed for results and potential transportability to a LMIC setting. Of 108 articles identified, 7 met criteria for inclusion. Three evaluated patient-level interventions and four evaluated health services interventions. Of the patient-level interventions, two were experimental designs and one was a retrospective cohort study. None of these interventions improved ART adherence or viral suppression. Of the four health services interventions, two targeted stable patients and reduced the amount of time spent in the clinic or grouped patients together for bi-monthly meetings, and two targeted patients newly diagnosed with HIV or not yet deemed clinically stable and augmented clinical care with home-based case-management. The two studies targeting stable patients used retrospective cohort designs and found that adolescents and youth were less likely to maintain viral suppression than children or adults. The two studies targeting patients not yet deemed clinically stable included one experimental and one retrospective cohort design and showed improved ART adherence and viral suppression outcomes. ART adherence and viral suppression outcomes remain a major challenge among adolescents and youth. Intensive home-based case management models of care hold promise for improving outcomes in this population and warrant further research.","Reif, Lindsey K.; Abrams, Elaine J.; Arpadi, Stephen; Elul, Batya; McNairy, Margaret L.; Fitzgerald, Daniel W.; Kuhn, Louise",AIDS Behav,90,3

Physician associates within the UK undergo an intensive 2-year postgraduate medical education. As a new group of health professionals, they represent a fresh pair of eyes through which to examine clinical empathy, its nature and teaching. METHODS: Working with a constructivist paradigm, utilising grounded theory methodology, researchers studied 19 purposively sampled physician associate students in two UK medical schools. One-to-one semi-structured interviews were transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: The global themes were the pathways to empathy, empathy modifiers and empathic dissonance a novel term to describe the discomfort students experience when pressurised into making empathic statements they don’t sincerely feel. Students preferred using non-verbal over verbal expressions of empathy. A conceptual model is proposed. The more substantial empathic pathway, affective empathy, involves input from the heart. An alternative empathy, more constrained, comes from the head: cognitive empathy was considered a solution to time pressure and emotional burden. Formal teaching establishes empathic dissonance, a problem which stems from over-reliance on the empathic statement as the means to deliver clinical empathy. CONCLUSIONS: This study furthers our understanding of the construct and teaching of empathy. It identifies empathic barriers, especially time pressure. It proposes a novel concept—empathic dissonance—a concept that challenges medical educationalists to reframe future empathy teaching.","Laughey, William F.; Brown, Megan E.

These travelers are at risk for a variety of infectious diseases that are endemic in these areas; the most frequently occurring of these is diarrhea. Studies of groups of travelers to Latin America and Africa have found that approximately one-half develop diarrhea during their stay abroad. Etiologic investigations of these illnesses have demonstrated that the important agents that cause travelers' diarrhea are similar to those that cause diarrhea in children in the developing countries. One-third of the cases are associated with enterotoxin-producing strains of Escherichia coli. Smaller proportions appear to be due to rotavirus, Norwalk virus, Shigella, Salmonella, Giardia lamblia, and Entamoeba histolytica.

This project builds on previous work examining negativity bias using dual-valence ambiguity. Specifically, although some facial expressions have a relatively clear negative (angry) or positive valence (happy), surprised expressions are interpreted negatively by some and positively by others, providing insight into one’s valence bias. Here, we examine putative sources of variability that distinguish individuals with a more negative versus positive valence bias using structural equation modeling. Our model reveals that one’s propensity toward negativity (operationalized as temperamental negative affect and internalizing symptomology) predicts valence bias particularly in older adulthood when a more positive bias is generally expected. Further, variability in social connectedness (a propensity to seek out social connections, use those connections to regulate one’s own emotions, and be empathic) emerges as a notable and unique predictor of valence bias, likely because these traits help to override an initial, default negativity. We argue that this task represents an important approach to examining variability in affective bias, and can be specifically useful across the lifespan and in populations with internalizing disorders or even subclinical symptomology.","Neta, Maital; Brock, Rebecca L.",Sci Rep,90,3

Stakeholders’ opinions about these ethical issues are important since they can help in the development of ethical guidelines to govern biobanking activities. Physicians are among the important stakeholders since they contact potential participants and could be biobank users. The goal of this study is to evaluate the perceptions and attitude of Egyptian physicians towards ethical issues in biobanking. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was designed and distributed with the target group between November 2019 and January 2020. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 223 physicians. While 65.5% reported hearing the term ""Biobanking"" before, 45.7% knew that there are biobanks in Egypt. Participants had a general positive attitude towards the value of biobanks in research. About 73% agreed that biobanks can share biospecimens with international research organizations, but only 42.6% supported collaboration with pharmaceutical companies, and 44% agreed to the use of user fees by biobanks. About 48% supported the use of broad consent in biobanks, and 73.1% believed that donors of biospecimens should be informed about results of research performed on their biospecimens. CONCLUSION: Although many Egyptian physicians heard about biobanking, they had limited knowledge about the existence of biobanks in Egypt. They had concerns about commercialization, use of broad consent and user fees. A knowledge gap exists among these stakeholders, which should be covered by different educational activities. Community discussions should start to reach consensus about the issues of commercialization and return of research results.","Abdelhafiz, Ahmed Samir; Sultan, Eman A.; Ziady, Hany H.; Sayed, Douaa M.; Khairy, Walaa A.",PLoS One,90,1

This may indicate low quality EOL care if discordant with patient preferences. We investigated preferred potential place of death and preferences regarding use of mechanical ventilation in a cohort of Texas cancer patients. METHODS: A population-based convenience sample of recently diagnosed cancer patients from the Texas Cancer Registry was surveyed using a multi-scale inventory between March 2018 and June 2020. Item responses to questions about preferences regarding location of death and mechanical ventilation were the outcome measures of this investigation. Inverse probability weighting analysis was used to construct multivariable logistic regression examining the associations of covariates. RESULTS: Of the 1460 respondents, a majority (82%) preferred to die at home compared to 8% who preferred dying at the hospital. In total, 25% of respondents expressed a preference for undergoing mechanical ventilation at the EOL. Adjusted analysis showed increased preference among Black (OR = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.19–2.73) and other non-white, non-Hispanic race individuals (OR = 3.53; 95% CI: 1.99–6.27) for dying at a hospital. Males, married individuals, those of higher education and poor self-reported health showed significantly higher preference for dying at home. Non-white respondents of all races were more likely to prefer mechanical ventilation at the EOL as were individuals who lived with another person at home. CONCLUSION: Non-white cancer patients were more likely to express preferences coinciding with aggressive EOL care including dying at the hospital and utilizing mechanical ventilation. These findings were independent of other sociodemographic characteristics, including decisional self-efficacy.","Boyce-Fappiano, David; Liao, Kaiping; Miller, Christopher; Peterson, Susan K.; Elting, Linda S.; Guadagnolo, B.

Here, we investigate the impact of social identity (i.e. team identification) with a football team on the sensorial experience and willingness to buy a beverage, said to be sponsoring the ingroup or the outgroup team. Ninety subjects participated in one of three sensorial experience conditions (matched identity: ingroup beverage; mismatched identity: outgroup beverage; control: no group preference). Each participant tasted the new sponsoring beverage and answered a questionnaire about their subjective sensorial experience of the beverage. EEG and BVP were synchronously collected throughout. Analyses revealed that team identification does not influence subjective responses and only slightly modulates physiological signals. All participants reported high valence and arousal values while physiological signals consistently translated negative affects across groups, which showed that participants reported to be happy/excited about trying the beverage while their physiological signals showed that they were feeling sad/depressed/angry. Crucially, despite a similar sensorial experience, and similar socially desirable report of the subjective experience, only participants in the matched identity group demonstrate higher willingness to buy, showing that the level of team identification, but not taste or beverage quality, influences willingness to buy the said sponsor’s product.","Franco, Sara; Abreu, Ana Maria; Biscaia, Rui; Gama, Sandra",PLoS One,90,1

STUDY QUESTION: What are the milestones of the changes in the expert approach to the pharmacological management of peptic ulcer in the past century? STUDY DESIGN: To determine the changes in the experts' approach to the management of peptic ulcer, as presented in a widely used textbook in the United States. DATA SOURCES: The chapters presenting the management of peptic ulcer in the 26 editions of Cecil Textbook of Medicine published from 1927 through 2020. RESULTS: Acid neutralization with alkalies was the only pharmacological intervention recommended in the textbooks published from 1927 to 1975. Atropine and other antimuscarinic agents were mainly used to relieve pain and acid secretion according to the paradigm “no acid no ulcer.” The shift to the acid suppression paradigm started with the introduction of the histamine-2 receptor antagonist cimetidine in 1979, the proton-pump inhibitor omeprazole in 1988, and the prostaglandin agonist misoprostol in 1992. Finally, the eradication of Helicobacter pylori was codified in 1996. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacological management of peptic ulcer has remained archaic well into the 20th century. Fundamental progress occurred in a very short period (1979–1996) and was due to paradigm shifts from acid neutralization to acid suppression and later the recognition of the role of H. pylori infection.","Manu, Peter; Rogozea, Liliana M.; Sandor, Vlaicu; Dumitraşcu, Dan L.",Am J Ther,90,11

Sharing such data, however, can lead to serious privacy issues, because individuals could be re-identified, not only based on possible nodes’ attributes, but also from the structure of the network around them. The risk associated with re-identification can be measured and it is more serious in some networks than in others. While various optimization algorithms have been proposed to anonymize networks, there is still only a limited theoretical understanding of which network features are important for the privacy problem. Using network models and real data, we show that the average degree of networks is a crucial parameter for the severity of re-identification risk from nodes’ neighborhoods. Dense networks are more at risk, and, apart from a small band of average degree values, either almost all nodes are uniquely re-identifiable or they are all safe. Our results allow researchers to assess the privacy risk based on a small number of network statistics which are available even before the data is collected. As a rule-of-thumb, the privacy risks are high if the average degree is above 10. Guided by these results, we explore sampling of edges as a strategy to mitigate the re-identification risk of nodes. This approach can be implemented during the data collection phase, and its effect on various network measures can be estimated and corrected using sampling theory. The new understanding of the uniqueness of neighborhoods in networks presented in this work can support the development of privacy-aware ways of designing network data collection procedures, anonymization methods, and sharing network data.","Romanini, Daniele; Lehmann, Sune; Kivelä, Mikko",Sci Rep,90,3

Clinical testing could be used to detect influenza in these studies if factors associated with clinical testing for influenza were better understood. METHODS: Adults hospitalized with ARI at three study sites during the study period were enrolled in CDC’s 2015–16 Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) study and tested for influenza by RT-PCR. Clinical testing information, presenting symptoms, and patient characteristics were collected from medical records and patient interview. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds of receiving a clinical test based on age, vaccination status, comorbidities, presentation with influenza-like illness (ILI; defined as fever and cough or sore throat) and other factors. RESULTS: Of 895 enrollees, 571 (64%) patients meeting study inclusion criteria received physician-ordered testing. Of these, 53% had a multipathogen panel, 13% had a rapid antigen test, 7% had singleplex PCR, <1% had viral culture, and 27% had multiple tests; influenza infection was detected in 55 (6%) patients. Of 150 influenza cases identified by study testing, 25 (17%) were not tested clinically. Enrollees who did not receive clinical testing were older, had longer time to admission, and were less likely to present with ILI. Immunosuppressive disorders (aOR=2.05), non-COPD lung conditions (aOR=1.68), presentation with ILI (aOR=4.03), and admission ≤2 days from symptom onset (aOR=1.89) were positively associated with receiving a clinical test (P < 0.01 for all; Figure 1). After adjusting for these factors, enrollees with influenza vaccination were 37% less likely (aOR=0.63) to receive a clinical test (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients with ARI who were clinically tested for influenza differed from those not tested. A lower likelihood of testing among influenza positive vaccinees could potentially bias VE estimates upward and requires further evaluation. Clinical testing alone may fail to detect a substantial proportion of influenza cases.

Avipoxviruses have been identified as the causative agent of disease in at least 232 species in 23 orders of birds. Vaccines based upon attenuated avipoxvirus strains provide good disease control in production poultry, although with the large and intensive production systems there are suggestions and real risks of emergence of strains against which current vaccines might be ineffective. Sequence analysis of the whole genome has revealed overall genome structure and function resemblance to the Chordopoxvirinae; however, avipoxvirus genomes exhibit large-scale genomic rearrangements with more extensive gene families and novel host range gene in comparison with the other Chordopoxvirinae. Phylogenetic analysis places the avipoxviruses externally to the Chorodopoxvirinae to such an extent that in the future it might be appropriate to consider the Avipoxviruses as a separate subfamily within the Poxviridae. A unique relationship exists between Fowlpox virus (FWPV) and reticuloendothelosis viruses. All FWPV strains carry a remnant long terminal repeat, while field strains carry a near full-length provirus integrated at the same location in the FWPV genome. With the development of techniques to construct poxviruses expressing foreign vaccine antigens, the avipoxviruses have gone from neglected obscurity to important vaccine vectors in the past 20 years. The seminal observation of their utility for delivery of vaccine antigens to non-avian species has driven much of the interest in this group of viruses. In the veterinary area, several recombinant avipoxviruses are commercially licensed vaccines. The most successful have been those expressing glycoprotein antigens of enveloped viruses, e.g. avian influenza, Newcastle diseases and West Nile viruses.

It is characterized by the use of four different primers specifically designed to recognize six distinct regions of the target gene, and the reaction process proceeds at a constant temperature using strand displacement reaction. Quickness and simplicity is the advantage of the method. Amplification and detection of gene can be completed in a single step, by incubating the mixture of samples, primers, DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity and substrates at a constant temperature. The method was applied to two fungal infections; paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a deep mycosis caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Ochroconis gallopava infection. For PCM a combination of F3, B3, FIP, and BIP primers designed from the partial sequence of P. brasiliensis gp43 gene was used. The PCR products amplified by the primer set; F3 and B3 showed species specificity for P. brasiliensis and the detection limit of the PCR was 100 fg of fungal genomic DNA. The specific DNA banding pattern of P. brasiliensis was detected in the clinical and nine-banded armadillo derived isolates, paraffin-embedded tissue sample or sputum from PCM patient. LAMP method was used also for the identification of O. gallopava by using species-specific primer sets based on the D1/D2 domain of the LSU rDNA sequence. The method successfully detected the gene from both fungal DNA derived from brains and spleens of experimentally-infected mice with O. gallopava and environmental isolates. In conclusion, LAMP method for PCM and O. gallopava seemed to be useful for identification, diagnosis or retrospective study with advantage in the quickness and simplicity procedure, but require strictly-controlled environments.","Sano, Ayako; Itano, Eiko Nakagawa",Molecular Identification of Fungi,90,3

However, as a result of the staining process, the tissue slides are being deformed and registration is required before further processing. The importance of this problem led to organizing an open challenge named Automatic Non-rigid Histological Image Registration Challenge (ANHIR), organized jointly with the IEEE ISBI 2019 conference. The challenge organizers provided several hundred image pairs and a server-side evaluation platform. One of the most difficult sub-problems for the challenge participants was to find an initial, global transform, before attempting to calculate the final, non-rigid deformation field. This article solves the problem by proposing a deep network trained in an unsupervised way with a good generalization. We propose a method that works well for images with different resolutions, aspect ratios, without the necessity to perform image padding, while maintaining a low number of network parameters and fast forward pass time. The proposed method is orders of magnitude faster than the classical approach based on the iterative similarity metric optimization or computer vision descriptors. The success rate is above 98% for both the training set and the evaluation set. We make both the training and inference code freely available.","Wodzinski, Marek; Müller, Henning",Biomedical Image Registration,90,1

However, the prognostic role of metabolism-related genes (MRGs) remains to be elucidated. We aimed to establish a nomogram by combining MRGs signature and clinicopathological factors to predict melanoma prognosis. Eighteen prognostic MRGs between melanoma and normal samples were identified using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GSE15605. WARS (HR = 0.881, 95% CI = 0.788–0.984, P = 0.025) and MGST1 (HR = 1.124, 95% CI = 1.007–1.255, P = 0.037) were ultimately identified as independent prognostic MRGs with LASSO regression and multivariate Cox regression. The MRGs signature was established according to these two genes and externally validated in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that patients in the high-risk group had significantly poorer overall survival (OS) than those in the low-risk group. Furthermore, the MRGs signature was identified as an independent prognostic factor for melanoma survival. An MRGs nomogram based on the MRGs signature and clinicopathological factors was developed in TCGA cohort and validated in the GEO dataset. Calibration plots showed good consistency between the prediction of nomogram and actual observation. The receiver operating characteristic curve and decision curve analysis indicated that MRGs nomogram had better OS prediction and clinical net benefit than the stage system. To our knowledge, we are the first to develop a prognostic nomogram based on MRGs signature with better predictive power than the current staging system, which could assist individualized prognosis prediction and improve treatment.","Zeng, Furong; Su, Juan; Peng, Cong; Liao, Mengting; Zhao, Shuang; Guo, Ying; Chen, Xiang; Deng, Guangtong",Front Oncol,90,1

METHOD: ology: All the routinely examined appendectomy specimens received in the pathology laboratory of a referral hospital over a three year period of time were reviewed for the existence of E. v. These cases were evaluated for clinico-laboratory characterization. RESULTS: Out of 1150 appendectomies for clinical acute appendicitis picture, 31 (2.7%) cases revealed E. v infestation. The age ranged from 6 to 42 years old but more than 80% of the E. v infected cases were children. Twenty four cases (77.4%) did not show any other appendiceal pathology, six cases showed lymphoid hyperplasia and only one case showed concomitant histological acute inflammatory process. CONCLUSION: E. v infestation is an incidental finding during histopathology examination of appendectomy specimens for patients with clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis, however there is no relation between the existence of E. v and occurrence of acute appendicitis which is the main indication for appendectomy, so further studies are recommended to reach out earlier diagnosis to eliminate the unnecessary surgical intervention. Also surgeons should consider E. v as a differential diagnosis when removing a normal looking appendix to take the necessary precautions for minimizing any chance of contamination and sending all the normal looking appendectomy specimens for histopathology examination.","Hasan, Abdulkarim; Nafie, Khalid; El-Sayed, Samar; Nasr, Mohamed; Abdulmohaymen, Ayman; Baheeg, Mohamed; Abbadi, Osama",Ann Med Surg (Lond),90,0

To realise food security people in the region have resorted to growing drought resistant crops such as sorghum. The recent observations are that the success of sorghum as a drought resistant crop is accompanied by ambivalence as some people view the crop to be unsuitable as a staple food while others rely on it to cope with food insecurity. Some families have resorted to farming cash crops such as cotton and use the dividends to buy maize meal as the staple food. However, recently some farmers have started intensive production of uninga, an indigenous crop which had almost become extinct among the Ndau people (an ethnic grouping of Ndau-speaking) of south-eastern Zimbabwe. The production of this crop is under-researched and understudied in Zimbabwe. To fill this lacuna, we adopted a participatory case study research approach to explore the nature and scope of uninga production. An Afrocentric-postcolonial lens was employed to investigate the factors for its resurgence after decades of absence in the agricultural crop basket. We found that the crop which used to be largely cultivated by women in the past, had become a ‘must-plant’ crop for all gender owing to its high demand on the market, especially in Mozambique.","Muyambo, Tenson; Shava, Soul",Int,90,16

During the surge, Metropolitan Detroit was the epicenter of the outbreak, accounting for 80% of cases and 86% of deaths statewide. Healthcare workers (HCW) are particularly at risk; however, rates of infection based on job category has not been described previously in the United States. We describe the impact of the outbreak on our workforce. Background Michigan COVID [Image: see text] Figure 1 [Image: see text] METHODS: This was a retrospective review of employees with COVID-19 at Henry Ford Health System (HFHS), a comprehensive, integrated, health care organization in Southeast Michigan includes 5 hospitals and 9 emergency departments from 3/10/2020–6/10/2020. Employees exhibiting symptoms and/or signs consistent with COVID-19 infection were referred to employee health and tested for SARS-CoV-2. All employees with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of upper respiratory tract were included. Data were obtained from a dedicated analytics dashboard that tracked all testing and results for employees. Rate (number positives/total tested) of infection for each job category was determined. RESULTS: A total 5352 (16%) of 33538 employees were tested, of whom 1036 (19%) tested positive. The number of infected workers represents approximately 3.1 % of the workforce. The sharp increase of COVID-19 admissions correlated with the rise in HCW COVID-19 positivity (Figure 1). The number of HCW tested largely correlated with the disease burden at each hospital (Figure2). Table 1 shows total population of symptomatic HCW tested and demonstrates volume of testing and positivity were higher among HCW with close patient contact. The positivity rates in specific clinical support staff are shown in Table 2. Notably, there were high rates of positivity among non-clinical business and management employees tested suggesting community-transmission. Table 1 [Image: see text] Table 2 [Image: see text] Figure 2 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: COVID-19 risk is highest among HCW in high volume settings with close patient contact. Community exposure may be an important factor that contributes to this risk. Strategies to minimize transmission in healthcare settings should be combined with HCW education emphasizing measures to avoid exposure within the community.

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR/HHS) and other agencies are seeking to track and correlate viral genome sequences with clinical and epidemiological (CE) data. A crucial part of that framework is obtaining detailed CE data from frontline facilities. In response, we sought to contribute by creating a registry of detailed CE data from SARS-COV -2 infected patients at five hospitals, spanning eleven counties in Western New York. METHODS: In addition to the usual demographics, comorbidities, and categories of outpatient prescriptions, the registry has 75 laboratory, 2 imaging, 19 therapeutic, and 4 outcome-related parameters. Mann-Whitney U Test for continuous variables and Chi-squared and Fisher Exact Test for categorical variables were performed in R and Minitab. RESULTS: The registry currently includes data from 399 patients: 236 ambulatory and 163 inpatient. Several comorbidities were associated with requirement for admission compared to ambulatory status, including obesity and kidney, liver, and cardiovascular disease (all p < /= 0.01) (Table 1). Use of angiotensin inhibitors and receptor blockers, statins, and acid suppressants was higher in admitted vs. ambulatory patients (all p < /=0.001) (Table 1 and Figure). Diabetes mellitus and statin use were more common in patients who required intensive care, p=0.04 and 0.01 respectively (Table 2).

It also provides a framework for surge planning, predictive modeling, and linking CE data to whole genome sequencing data for precision epidemiology. As SARS-COV-2 reports from China, Italy, and New York City may not be fully generalizable to other regions, especially those not as severely affected or those in suburban and rural settings, reports from other areas are needed.

However, less is known about how this association operates among children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This meta-analytic review is the first to address the association between maternal sensitivity/availability and attachment security in a population of children with ASD (aged 1 to 7 years) and to explore if this association is moderated by child chronological age, mental age, ASD-related symptoms severity. The objective was also to assess the role of methodological moderators, including the informant of the attachment measure, country and publication year. A systematic search was performed on relevant databases. Seven studies were retained. Meta-analytic results showed a significant medium effect size between maternal sensitivity/availability and attachment security in children with ASD (r = .47; 95% CI: 0.32–.60; p < .001), which is a stronger association than in the general population (r = .24). Moderation analyses did not show any significant effect of child chronological age and publication year on effect sizes. The categorical moderators (e.g., informant, country) could not be tested due to the limited number of studies. More research is needed to better understand the way mothers adapt to their children with autism and identify the nuances regarding how maternal sensitivity/availability relates to child attachment in the context of ASD.

Based on the job demand resources model, stressors, challenges and resources are examined in addition to the target variables of work ability, job satisfaction and health. The results indicate that stressors and work resources roughly keep the balance, even if, for example, job satisfaction and health are only at a medium level. Above all, there is still a need of action regarding autonomy of employees. The digital transformation is seen as an opportunity to expand the scope for action and decision-making.

Establishment of chronic infection by M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis depends on its subversion of host immune responses. This includes blocking the ability of infected macrophages to be activated by gamma interferon (IFN-γ) for clearance of this intracellular pathogen. To define the mechanism by which M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis subverts this critical host cell function, patterns of signal transduction to IFN-γ stimulation of uninfected and M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected bovine monocytes were determined through bovine-specific peptide arrays for kinome analysis. Pathway analysis of the kinome data indicated activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, a hallmark of IFN-γ signaling, in uninfected monocytes. In contrast, IFN-γ stimulation of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected monocytes failed to induce patterns of peptide phosphorylation consistent with JAK-STAT activation. The inability of IFN-γ to induce differential phosphorylation of peptides corresponding to early JAK-STAT intermediates in infected monocytes indicates that M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis blocks responsiveness at, or near, the IFN-γ receptor. Consistent with this hypothesis, increased expression of negative regulators of the IFN-γ receptors SOCS1 and SOCS3 as well as decreased expression of IFN-γ receptor chains 1 and 2 is observed in M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected monocytes. These patterns of expression are functionally consistent with the kinome data and offer a mechanistic explanation for this critical M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis behavior. Understanding this mechanism may contribute to the rational design of more effective vaccines and/or therapeutics for Johne's disease.","Arsenault, Ryan J; Li, Yue; Bell, Kelli; Doig, Kimberley; Potter, Andrew; Griebel, Philip J; Kusalik, Anthony; Napper, Scott",Infection and immunity,90,1

Being intimately involved in the coordinated response, the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University has been a first-hand witness to the strengths and weaknesses of the current medical education system in China. On the one hand, we believe that the distinguished contributions in disease containment efforts by healthcare professionals indicated that our medical education system has achieved its intended outcomes and is socially accountable. On the other hand, we have also identified three major issues that need to be addressed from an educational standpoint: insufficient emphasis on public health emergency preparedness; unsophisticated mechanisms for interdisciplinary cooperation; and inadequate guidance in medical ethics. Whilst these reflections might be seen in its summative form, we would suggest changing it to that of a formative process, where we learn from our assessment through observation and feedback of the gaps, upon which improvement of our present situation can be made. We hope that these lessons may be helpful to our colleagues in the rest of China and around the world, who are engaged in medical educational reform.","Yang, Da-Ya; Cheng, Shu-Yuan; Wang, Shu-Zhen; Wang, Jin-Song; Kuang, Ming; Wang, Ting-Huai; Xiao, Hai-Peng",Medical teacher,90,1

The subject of this study was to examine the proliferation change of oral cancer cells while using the combined treatment of UVC (254 nm) with our previously developed sulfonyl chromen-4-ones (CHW09), namely UVC/CHW09. Cell viability, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and DNA damage for the individual and combined treatments for UVC and/or CHW09 were examined in oral cancer Ca9-22 cells. In 24 h MTS assay, UVC (30 J/m2; UVC30), or CHW09 (25 and 50 µg/mL; namely, CHW09-25 and CHW09-50) show 54%, 59%, and 45% viability. The combined treatment (UVC30/CHW09-25 and UVC30/CHW09-50) show lower cell viability (45% and 35%). Mechanistically, UVC/CHW09 induced higher apoptosis than individual treatments and untreated control, which were supported by the evidence of flow cytometry for subG1, annexin V/7-aminoactinomycin D, pancaspase and caspases 3/7 activity, and western blotting for cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Moreover, this cleaved PARP expression was downregulated by pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. UVC/CHW09 showed higher oxidative stress than individual treatments and untreated control in terms of flow cytometry for reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial mass. Furthermore, UVC/CHW09 showed higher DNA damage than individual treatments and untreated control in terms of flow cytometry for H2A histone family member X and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine. In conclusion, combined treatment UVC/CHW09 suppresses proliferation, and promotes apoptosis, oxidative stress, and DNA damage against oral cancer cells, providing a novel application of sulfonyl chromen-4-ones in order to sensitize UVC induced proliferation inhibition for oral cancer therapy.","Wang, Sheng-Chieh; Wang, Yen-Yun; Lin, Li-Ching; Chang, Meng-Yang; Yuan, Shyng-Shiou F; Tang, Jen-Yang; Chang, Hsueh-Wei",International journal of molecular sciences,90,20

As CCE evaluation can be time consuming, a new software algorithm might aid in reducing evaluation time. OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to evaluate whether it is feasible to reliably detect colon polyps in CCE videos with a new software algorithm the ""collage mode"" (Rapid 8 Software, Covidien/Medtronic®). METHODS Twenty-nine CCE videos were randomly presented to three experienced and to three inexperienced investigators. Videos were evaluated by applying the collage mode. Investigation time was documented and the results (≥one polyp vs. no polyp) were compared with the findings of two highly experienced central readers who read the CCE videos in the standard mode beforehand. RESULTS It took a median time of 9.8, 3.5, and 7.5 vs. 4.3, 4.6 and 12.5 min for experienced vs. inexperienced investigators to review the CCE videos. For detecting ≥one polyp vs. no polyp, sensitivity of 93.3%, 73.3%, and 93.3% was observed for the experienced and sensitivity of 46.7%, 33.3%, and 93.3% for the inexperienced CCE readers. CONCLUSION Collage mode might allow for a quick review of CCE videos with a high polyp detection rate for experienced CCE readers. Future prospective studies should include CCE collage mode for rapid polyp detection to further prove the feasibility of practical colon polyp detection by CCE and possibly support the role of CCE as a screening tool in CRC prevention.","Hausmann, Johannes; Linke, Jan-Peter; Albert, Jörg G; Masseli, Johannes; Tal, Andrea; Kubesch, Alica; Filmann, Natalie; Philipper, Michael; Farnbacher, Michael",International journal of colorectal disease,90,31

Since then, pathogens have continuously evolved under selective antimicrobial pressure resulting in a lack of significant improvement in clinical effectiveness in the antimicrobial therapy of septic shock despite ever more broad-spectrum and potent drugs. In addition, although substantial effort and money has been expended on the development novel non-antimicrobial therapies of sepsis in the past 30 years, clinical progress in this regard has been limited. This review explores the possibility that the current pathophysiologic paradigm of septic shock fails to appropriately consider the primacy of the microbial burden of infection as the primary driver of septic organ dysfunction. An alternate paradigm is offered that suggests that has substantial implications for optimizing antimicrobial therapy in septic shock. This model of disease progression suggests the key to significant improvement in the outcome of septic shock may lie, in great part, with improvements in delivery of existing antimicrobials and other anti-infectious strategies. Recognition of the role of delays in administration of antimicrobial therapy in the poor outcomes of septic shock is central to this effort. However, therapeutic strategies that improve the degree of antimicrobial cidality likely also have a crucial role.","Kumar, Anand",Virulence,90,1

Despite recent efforts, there are numerous notable gaps in the understanding of MERS-CoV seasonal diversity. We aimed at investigating the global seasonal occurrence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS We obtained the data on the prevalence and occurrence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection from the World Health Organization (WHO) for all the MERS cases reported from the various countries and their allied ministries. We also recorded the research documents published in various global scientific journals on the seasonal occurrence of MERS-CoV infection during the period 2012-2017. RESULTS Worldwide 2048 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported from June 2012 to the Dec 2017. 1680 (82.03%) cases were from the Saudi Arabia and 368 (17.96%) cases were reported from the other countries of the world. The maximum number of cases reported in June was 474 (23.14%). 287 (14.01%) cases were reported from Saudi Arabia and remaining 187 (9.13%) cases were reported from all over the world. The number of cases reported from April to June was 396 (19.33%) while the cases encountered from October to December were 231 (11.27%). CONCLUSIONS The highest global seasonal occurrence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-MERS-CoV outbreak cases were found in the month of June, while the lowest was found in the month of January during the period of 2012 to 2017. The pattern of MERS-CoV infections has been observed to have seasonal variations. It is suggested that the health officials should highlight the seasonal occurrence of MERS-CoV outbreak and take better preventive measures to minimize the disease burden nationally and globally.","Nassar, M S; Bakhrebah, M A; Meo, S A; Alsuabeyl, M S; Zaher, W A",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,90,16

Dressings are widely used to treat pressure ulcers and there are many options to choose from including alginate dressings. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use for the treatment of pressure ulcers. This review is part of a suite of Cochrane reviews investigating the use of dressings in the treatment of pressure ulcers. Each review will focus on a particular dressing type. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of alginate dressings for treating pressure ulcers in any care setting. SEARCH METHODS For this review, in April 2015 we searched the following databases the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of alginate with alternative wound dressings or no dressing in the treatment of pressure ulcers (stage II or above). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS We included six studies (336 participants) in this review; all studies had two arms. The included studies compared alginate dressings with six other interventions that included: hydrocolloid dressings, silver containing alginate dressings, and radiant heat therapy. Each of the six comparisons included just one study and these had limited participant numbers and short follow-up times. All the evidence was of low or very low quality. Where data were available there was no evidence of a difference between alginate dressings and alternative treatments in terms of complete wound healing or adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The relative effects of alginate dressings compared with alternative treatments are unclear. The existing trials are small, of short duration and at risk of bias. Decision makers may wish to consider aspects such as cost of dressings and the wound management properties offered by each dressing type, for example, exudate management.","Dumville, Jo C; Keogh, Samantha J; Liu, Zhenmi; Stubbs, Nikki; Walker, Rachel M; Fortnam, Mathew",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,90,19

Our aim was to investigate the therapeutic effects of infliximab, intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIg) or combination therapy in patients with severe COVID-19 disease admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS In this observational research, we studied 104 intubated adult patients with severe COVID-19 infection (based on clinical symptoms, and radiographic or CT scan parameters) who were admitted to the ICU of a multispecialty hospital during March 2020 in Tehran, Iran. All cases received standard treatment regimens as local protocol (Oseltamivir + hydroxychloroquine + lopinavir/ritonavir or sofosbuvir or atazanavir ± ribavirin). The cases were grouped as controls (n = 43), infliximab (n = 27), IVIg (n = 23) and combination (n = 11). RESULTS There was no significant difference between controls and treatment groups in terms of underlying diseases or the number of underlying diseases. The mean age (SD) of cases was 72.42 (16.06) in the control group, 64.52 (12.965) in IVIg, 63.40 (17.57) in infliximab and 64.00 (11.679) in combination therapy; (P = 0.047, 0.031 and 0.11, respectively). Also, 37% in the infliximab group, 26.1% in IVIg, 45.5% in combination therapy, and 62.8% in the control group expired (all P < 0.05).

METHODS This study included all patients with a FTMH that developed after RRD repair from January 1, 2015-July 31, 2020. The main outcome was the rate of FTMH formation following RRD repair as well as characteristics of FTMH following RRD repair that spontaneously close. RESULTS There were 470 eyes with a diagnosis of both a FTMH and a RRD during the study period. Of these, 27 (0.28%) developed a FTMH following RRD repair. The median time to FTMH diagnosis was 91 days (25th, 75th quartiles 40, 204 days). The mean minimum hole diameter was 514.5 ± 303.6 microns. There were 4 FTMHs (14.8%) that spontaneously closed without surgical intervention. The spontaneous closure was noted from 4 to 12 weeks after the initial diagnosis of the FTMH. These holes were smaller than the holes that did not close spontaneously (mean minimum diameter 161.8 ± 85.2 vs 588.7 ± 279.3 microns, p = 0.0058). Of the 27 post-operative FTMHs, there were 23 eyes (85%) that underwent surgical intervention with pars plana vitrectomy and internal limiting membrane peeling. Nineteen eyes (83%) closed with one surgery, 20 eyes (87%) ultimately closed, while 3 eyes (11.1%) did not close. CONCLUSIONS FTMH is relatively uncommon to occur following RRD repair with a prevalence of 0.28% in our series with 87% of these holes achieving closure following surgery or spontaneously. Approximately 15% of FTMHs following RRD repair closed spontaneously and these holes were significantly smaller.","Starr, Matthew R; Lee, Crystal; Arias, Diego; Mahmoudzadeh, Raziyeh; Salabati, Mirataollah; Kuriyan, Ajay E; Regillo, Carl D; Hsu, Jason; Yonekawa, Yoshihiro; Gupta, Omesh P",Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,90,1

Such remote care delivery methods include the use of telehealth technologies including clinical video telehealth or telephone visits. Prior to this, research on the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of telehealth applied to rheumatology, or telerheumatology, has been limited. RECENT FINDINGS Telerheumatology visits were found to be noninferior to in-person visits and are often more time and cost effective for patients. Clinicians and patients both noted the lack of a physical exam in telehealth visits and patients missed the opportunity to have lab work done or other diagnostic tests they are afforded with in-person visits. Overall, patients and clinicians had positive attitudes toward the use of telerheumatology and agreed on its usefulness, even beyond the pandemic. SUMMARY Although telerheumatology has the potential to expand the reach of rheumatology practice, some of the most vulnerable patients still lack the most basic resources required for a telehealth visit. As the literature on telerheumatology continues to expand, attention should be paid to health equity, the digital divide, as well as patient preferences in order to foster true shared decision-making over telehealth.","Matsumoto, Rachel A; Barton, Jennifer L",Current opinion in rheumatology,90,1

Dressings form a key part of ulcer treatment, with clinicians and patients having many different types to choose from. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use. OBJECTIVES To summarize data from systematic reviews of randomised controlled trial evidence on the effectiveness of dressings for healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS We searched the following databases for relevant systematic reviews and associated analyses: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 2); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE; The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 1); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, 14 April 2015); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 14 April 2015). We also handsearched the Cochrane Wounds Group list of reviews. Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Complete wound healing was the primary outcome assessed; secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life, adverse events, resource use and dressing performance. MAIN RESULTS We found 13 eligible systematic reviews relevant to this overview that contained a total of 17 relevant RCTs. One review reported the results of a network meta-analysis and so presented information on indirect, as well as direct, treatment effects. Collectively the reviews reported findings for 11 different comparisons supported by direct data and 26 comparisons supported by indirect data only. Only four comparisons informed by direct data found evidence of a difference in wound healing between dressing types, but the evidence was assessed as being of low or very low quality (in one case data could not be located and checked). There was also no robust evidence of a difference between dressing types for any secondary outcomes assessed. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is currently no robust evidence for differences between wound dressings for any outcome in foot ulcers in people with diabetes (treated in any setting). Practitioners may want to consider the unit cost of dressings, their management properties and patient preference when choosing dressings.","Wu, Lihua; Norman, Gill; Dumville, Jo C; O'Meara, Susan; Bell-Syer, Sally E M",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,90,1

Although roles of active Gsk3 in liver ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) have been well appreciated, whether Gsk3 N-terminal serine phosphorylation has any functional significance in the disease process remains unclear. In a murine liver partial warm ischemia model, we studied Gsk3 N-terminal serine mutant knock-in (KI) mice and showed that liver IRI was decreased in Gsk3αS21A but increased in Gsk3βS9A mutant KI mice. Bone marrow chimeric experiments revealed that the Gsk3α, but not β, mutation in liver parenchyma protected from IRI, and both mutations in bone marrow-derived cells exacerbated liver injuries. Mechanistically, mutant Gsk3α protected hepatocytes from inflammatory (TNF-α) cell death by the activation of HIV-1 TAT-interactive protein 60 (TIP60)-mediated autophagy pathway. The pharmacological inhibition of TIP60 or autophagy diminished the protection of the Gsk3α mutant hepatocytes from inflammatory cell death in vitro and the Gsk3α mutant KI mice from liver IRI in vivo. Thus, Gsk3 N-terminal serine phosphorylation inhibits liver innate immune activation but suppresses hepatocyte autophagy in response to inflammation. Gsk3 αS21, but not βS9, mutation is sufficient to sustain Gsk4 activities in hepatocytes and protect livers from IRI via TIP60 activation.","Ni, Ming; Zhou, Haoming; Zhang, Jing; Jin, Dan; Lu, Tianfei; Busuttil, Ronald W; Kupiec-Weglinski, Jerzy W; Wang, Xuehao; Zhai, Yuan",Journal of immunology,90,19

A preformed polyester mesh (Parietex; Covidien, Mansfield, Massachusetts) was used in all cases without any fixation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES All patients were prospectively followed up at 2 weeks, 1 month, and 1 year after surgery. Operative morbidity, chronic pain, and hernia recurrence were recorded. RESULTS Two hundred seventy-four consecutive patients underwent 311 total extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repairs. No conversions were made to open hernia repairs. No recurrences were found at the 12-month follow-up visit. There were 19 inguinal seromas (6.1%) identified at 2 weeks, but only 7 (1.9%) remained at 1 month, and none at 1 year. No wound infections, scrotal hematomas, or other perioperative complications were reported. Two hundred thirty-six patients used fewer than the 30 prescribed tablets for pain control, while 23 patients requested a refill, 12 of whom had seromas (P < .01). At 12 months, no patient was taking pain relief medication; however, 8 patients reported occasional discomfort in the groin, and 1 patient reported occasional umbilical discomfort. CONCLUSION This single general surgeon experience supports total extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair without mesh fixation as a safe, effective procedure with low morbidity and no evidence of recurrence at the 1-year follow-up visit.","Messaris, Evangelos; Nicastri, Guy; Dudrick, Stanley J",Archives of surgery,90,26

This review outlines factors that may interact to create these inequalities and explores the hypothesis that differing levels of cardio-metabolic risk, according to ethnic group, play a role. RECENT FINDINGS Two UK Biobank studies have reported that the body mass index is more strongly associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality in minority ethnic populations than in White populations. A study of UK patients found that the strongest association between obesity and adverse COVID-19 outcomes was in people of Black ethnicity. Differences in the prevalence of obesity and its metabolic sequelae have been shown to partly mediate ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 outcomes, although not always consistently. It is possible that ethnic differences in the consequences of obesity may explain some of the remaining disparity in COVID-19 risk.","Coleman, Paul; Barber, Thomas M; van Rens, Thijs; Hanson, Petra; Coffey, Alice; Oyebode, Oyinlola",Current obesity reports,90,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients (N = 516; 247 women; mean age, 67.1 y ± 15.1; range, 19.5-101.6 y) who received an Option filter between August 2009 and March 2015 at a single health care system were analyzed. RESULTS The study duration was 68 months, with median clinical follow-up of 7.1 months (range, 1 d to 61.8 mo). During follow-up, 73 of 83 patients (88.0%) underwent successful filter retrieval, 153 died (including three after successful retrieval), and 293 remained alive with filters in situ. Seventeen cases of breakthrough pulmonary embolism (PE) occurred (3.4%). Among 323 patients with direct filter imaging, there were two cases of tilt > 15°, one case of filter deformity, 16 cases of intracaval migration > 2 cm, and no cases of filter fracture. There were six cases of caval occlusion, nine cases of thrombus trapped inside the filter, and 57 cases of limb penetration on computed tomography scans or radiographs of the IVC. Retrieval failures were attributed to filter tilt or tip embedment in the caval wall (n = 4), complete IVC thrombosis (n = 3), thrombus inside the filter (n = 2), or inability to disengage filter legs (n = 1). Recurrent deep vein thrombosis occurred in 34 patients, including 32 with filters in situ and two whose filters had been removed. CONCLUSIONS Most Option filters were left in situ for permanent indications. Rates of successful retrieval, device-related complications, and breakthrough PE were similar to those associated with other retrievable filters.","Tsui, Brian; An, Tianzhi; Moon, Eunice; King, Russell; Wang, Weiping",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,90,16

Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) has recently been developed and seems equally effective while associated with fewer side-effects. Both require general anaesthesia, which could be quantified using the bispectral index (BIS). We compared ECT and MST with respect to recovery times, left-sided BIS, and left-right differences in BIS. METHODS In this prospective, observational study, we enrolled 10 successive patients receiving ECT and 10 patients undergoing MST. Anaesthesia was performed with propofol and monitored with a bilateral BIS sensor. The seizure was elicited when the BIS was within a range from 50 to 60. The time to eye opening was measured and bilateral BIS were recorded for 10 min after seizure induction. RESULTS A comparable anaesthetic depth was observed in the ECT and MST groups at baseline [mean (standard deviation, sd) BIS values of 94.1 (4.1) and 95.5 (3.0), respectively] and before seizure induction [mean (sd) BIS values of 52.3 (9.6) and 55.2 (10.3), respectively]. Post-ictally, MST patients opened their eyes significantly earlier than ECT patients [3.0 (1.0) vs 6.7 (1.3) min, P<0.001]. They showed a significantly higher BIS at 2 min after seizure induction [69.2 (10.1) vs 50.9 (15.9), P=0.003], and this difference was still present at 10 min after seizure induction [BIS 81.5 (6.5) vs 68.0 (16.4), P<0.001]. Significant differences between the left and right BIS were observed in neither the ECT nor the MST group. CONCLUSIONS At a comparable anaesthetic depth, MST is superior to ECT in terms of post-ictal recovery, which is correctly reflected by higher post-ictal BIS values. Unilateral BIS monitoring is sufficient to monitor anaesthetic depth in ECT and MST patients.

However, many hospitals need help with implementation. The Enhanced Recovery in National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ERIN) pilot was designed to support ERP implementation. Objective To evaluate the association of the ERIN pilot with LOS after colectomy. Design, Setting, and Participants Using a difference-in-differences design, pilot LOS before and after ERP implementation was compared with matched controls in a hierarchical model, adjusting for case mix and random effects of hospitals and matched pairs. The setting was 15 hospitals of varied size and academic status from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Preimplementation and postimplementation colectomy cases (July 1, 2013, to December 31, 2015) were collected using novel ERIN variables. Emergency and septic cases were excluded. A propensity score match identified a 2:1 control cohort of patients undergoing colectomy at non-ERIN hospitals. Interventions Pilot hospitals developed and implemented ERPs that included expert guidance, multidisciplinary teams, data audits, and opportunities for collaboration. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was LOS, and the secondary outcome was serious morbidity or mortality composite. Results There were 4975 colectomies performed by 15 ERIN pilot hospitals (3437 before implementation and 1538 after implementation) compared with a control cohort of 9950 colectomies (4726 before implementation and 5224 after implementation). The mean LOS decreased by 1.7 days in the pilot (6.9 [interquartile range (IQR), 4-8] days before implementation vs 5.2 [IQR, 3-6] days after implementation, P < .001) compared with 0.4 day in controls (6.4 [IQR, 4-7] days before implementation vs 6.0 [IQR, 3-7] days after implementation, P < .001). Readmission did not differ pre-post for the pilot or controls. Serious morbidity or mortality decreased for pilot participants (485 [14.1%] before implementation vs 162 [10.5%] after implementation, P < .001), with no difference in controls, and remained significant after risk adjustment (adjusted odds ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60-0.96). After adjusting for differences in case mix and for clustering in hospitals and matched pairs, the adjusted difference-in-differences model demonstrated a decrease in LOS by 1.1 days in the pilot over controls (P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance Participating ERIN pilot hospitals achieved shorter LOS and decreased complications after elective colectomy, without increasing readmissions. The ability to implement ERPs across hospitals of varied size and resources is essential. Lessons from the ERIN pilot may inform efforts to scale this effective and evidence-based intervention.","Berian, Julia R; Ban, Kristen A; Liu, Jason B; Sullivan, Christine L; Ko, Clifford Y; Thacker, Julie K M; Feldman, Liane S",JAMA surgery,90,1

Along the disease trajectory of high-grade glioma (HGG), patients are presented with a series of treatment decisions. At the same time, HGG patients often experience cognitive deterioration and reduced decision-making capacity. This study aimed to review the current knowledge about shared decision making from the perspective of the HGG patient. Methods Systematic searches were performed in MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and EMBASE. Studies were reviewed against the inclusion criteria and assessed for methodological quality. Descriptive data from the included studies were extracted and a narrative synthesis of the findings was performed. Results The searches resulted in 5051 original records. Four studies involving 178 HGG patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The narrative synthesis revealed that most HGG patients in the included studies appreciated an SDM approach and that sufficient information and involvement increased patients' emotional well-being. The use of a patient decision aid showed the potential to increase knowledge, decrease uncertainty, and affect the treatment decision making of HGG patients. Conclusion The results indicate that many HGG patients prefer an SDM approach and that SDM can lead patients toward improved emotional well-being. The evidence is weak, however, and firm conclusions and practice guidelines concerning SDM in HGG patients cannot be made. Future research is warranted to improve decision support for HGG patients.","Sorensen von Essen, Helle; Piil, Karin; Dahl Steffensen, Karina; Rom Poulsen, Frantz",Neuro-oncology practice,90,1

Antiviral therapy, including for COVID-19, is based on clinical practice, experimental data and trial results. The purpose of this review is to: provide and systematize actual preclinical data, clinical trials results and clinical practice for antiviral agent umifenovir (Arbidol). Databases Scopus, Web of Science, RSCI and medRxiv were used for publication searching from 2004. A meta-analysis of clinical trials results was performed. Umifenovir is antiviral agent, it belongs to fusion inhibitors, interacts with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Umifenovir the impede the trimerization of spike glycoprotein and inhibit host cell adhesion, at the level of the coronaviruses S-protein of interaction with ACE2 receptor. Preclinical studies in vitro and on animals show umifenovir activity against a number of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and others. Umifenovir, in combination with other antiviral drugs, symptomatic or traditional medicine, was used in China to treat patients with COVID-19, resulting in reduced mortality, virus elimination, the frequency of more severe course and complications in middle severity. However, antiviral therapy for the treatment of severe patients, with ARDS, did not lead to improved outcomes. In comparative clinical studies, umifenovir showed similar effectiveness with other antiviral drugs, and lower frequency of adverse reactions. Therapy with umifenovir, led to an increase percentage of patients with negative results of PCR tests on days 714 (I2=69.8%, RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.190.76; p=0.001). The efficacy and safety of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 still requires clinical investigation. Moderate forms of COVID-19 could be effectively treated by antivirals, but severe forms of COVID-19, characterized by pulmonary immunopathology, require different approaches to treatment.","Leneva, I A; Pshenichnaya, N Y; Bulgakova, V A",Terapevticheskii arkhiv,90,1

Currently, in sub-Saharan Africa, at least one-sixth of the population lives more than 2 h away from a public hospital, and one in eight people is no less than 1 h away from the nearest health center. We combine high-resolution data on the location of different typologies of public health care facilities [J. Maina et al., Sci. Data 6, 134 (2019)] with population distribution maps and terrain-specific accessibility algorithms to develop a multiobjective geographic information system framework for assessing the optimal allocation of new health care facilities and assessing hospitals expansion requirements. The proposed methodology ensures universal accessibility to public health care services within prespecified travel times while guaranteeing sufficient available hospital beds. Our analysis suggests that to meet commonly accepted universal health care accessibility targets, sub-Saharan African countries will need to build ∼6,200 new facilities by 2030. We also estimate that about 2.5 million new hospital beds need to be allocated between new facilities and ∼1,100 existing structures that require expansion or densification. Optimized location, type, and capacity of each facility can be explored in an interactive dashboard. Our methodology and the results of our analysis can inform local policy makers in their assessment and prioritization of health care infrastructure. This is particularly relevant to tackle health care accessibility inequality, which is not only prominent within and between countries of sub-Saharan Africa but also, relative to the level of service provided by health care facilities.","Falchetta, Giacomo; Hammad, Ahmed T; Shayegh, Soheil",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,90,1

STUDY DESIGN Case series. METHODS Retrospective review of SGS patients treated from 1996 to 2018 at a single institution to assess for 1) V-RQOL association with individual patient cumulative treatment number and 2) V-RQOL correlation with treatment type, time between treatments, and degree of stenosis. Analysis included both parametric and nonparametric statistical comparison across treatment types and multivariable and univariate linear regression. RESULTS Sixty-one patients, predominantly white (93%) and female (93%), were included. Etiology of SGS included idiopathic (61%), iatrogenic (16%), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (16%), and other (7%). The plurality of patients had four or more treatments (44%), with the remainder having one (28%), two (13%), or three treatments (15%). Analysis of change between pre- and postoperative V-RQOL scores was completed for 130 treatments. These included dilation with laser incision (52%), in-office injection (34%), dilation without division (8%), cricotracheal resection (1%), and all other treatment (8%). For every 10% improvement in airway caliber postoperatively, there was a 1.3-point improvement in calculated V-RQOL (r = 0.27, P = .02). After adjustment for treatment type, age, sex, and SGS etiology, this association held (beta = 1.5, P = .02). Change in V-RQOL was not associated with treatment type, treatment number, or time between treatments. CONCLUSION Patients with subglottic stenosis who have greater degree of change in airway caliber experience greater improvement in V-RQOL scores following treatment. V-RQOL scores are not associated with treatment type or time between individual treatments.

METHODS Four pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) both sexes with weights between 25 to 35 kg underwent percutaneous portal vein embolization with coils of the left portal vein. By contrasted CT, the difference between the liver parenchyma corresponding to the embolized zone and the normal one was identified. Immediately, using the fusion of images between ultrasound and CT as a guide, radiofrequency needles were placed percutaneouslyand then ablated until the liver partition was complete. Finally, hepatectomy was completed with a laparoscopic approach. RESULTS All animals have survived the procedures, with no reported complications. The successful portal embolization process was confirmed both by portography and CT. In the macroscopic analysis of the pieces, the depth of the ablation was analyzed. The hepatic hilum was respected. On the other hand, the correct position of the embolization material on the left portal vein could be also observed.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a counterregulatory enzyme of ACE that degrades angiotensin (Ang) II into Ang 1-7, has a protective role against ALI. Because ACE2 expression is severely reduced in the injured lung, a therapy targeted to improve ACE2 expression in lung might attenuate ALI. We hypothesized that MSCs overexpressing ACE2 would have further benefits in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI mice, when compared with MSCs alone. MSCs were transduced with ACE2 gene (MSC-ACE2) by a lentiviral vector and then infused into wild-type (WT) and ACE2 knockout (ACE2(-/y)) mice following an LPS-induced intratracheal lung injury. The results demonstrated that the lung injury of ALI mice was alleviated at 24 and 72 h after MSC-ACE2 transplantation. MSC-ACE2 improved the lung histopathology and had additional anti-inflammatory effects when compared with MSCs alone in both WT and ACE2(-/y) ALI mice. MSC-ACE2 administration also reduced pulmonary vascular permeability, improved endothelial barrier integrity, and normalized lung eNOS expression relative to the MSC group. The beneficial effects of MSC-ACE2 could be attributed to its recruitment into the injured lung and enhanced local expression of ACE2 protein without changing the serum ACE2 levels after MSC-ACE2 transplantation. The biological activity of the increased ACE2 protein decreased the Ang II amount and increased the Ang 1-7 level in the lung when compared with the ALI and MSC-only groups, thereby inhibiting the detrimental effects of accumulating Ang II. Therefore, compared to MSCs alone, the administration of MSCs overexpressing ACE2 resulted in a further improvement in the inflammatory response and pulmonary endothelial function of LPS-induced ALI mice. These additional benefits could be due to the degradation of Ang II that accompanies the targeted overexpression of ACE2 in the lung.","He, Hongli; Liu, Ling; Chen, Qihong; Liu, Airan; Cai, Shixia; Yang, Yi; Lu, Xiaomin; Qiu, Haibo",Cell transplantation,90,33

The ORF1a-encoded part of the resulting replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) is predicted to be processed proteolytically into ten non-structural proteins (nsps), known as nsp1-8, with both the nsp1 and nsp7 regions being cleaved internally (yielding nsp1α and nsp1β, and nsp7α and nsp7β, respectively). The experimental verification of these predictions depends strongly on the ability to identify individual cleavage products with specific antibodies. In this study, a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies was generated, which together were able to recognize eight ORF1a-encoded PRRSV nsps. Using these reagents, replicase cleavage products were detected in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells using a variety of immunoassays. By immunofluorescence microscopy, most nsps could be detected by 6 h post-infection. During the early stages of infection, nsp1β, nsp2, nsp4, nsp7α, nsp7β and nsp8 co-localized in distinct punctate foci in the perinuclear region of the cell, which were determined to be the site of viral RNA synthesis by in situ labelling. Western blot and immunoprecipitation analysis identified most individual nsps and several long-lived processing intermediates (nsp3-4, nsp5-7, nsp5-8 and nsp3-8). The identification and subcellular localization of PRRSV nsps in virus-infected cells documented here provides a basis for the further structure-function studies.

Recently, stents have been used to successfully treat CVS. This implies that the force required to expand spastic vessels and resolve vasospasm is lower than previously thought. OBJECTIVE We develop a mechanistic model of the spastic arterial wall to provide insight into CVS and predict the forces required to treat it. MATERIAL AND METHODS The arterial wall is modelled as a cylindrical membrane using a constrained mixture theory that accounts for the mechanical roles of elastin, collagen and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). We model the pressure diameter curve prior to CVS and predict how it changes following CVS. We propose a stretch-based damage criterion for VSMC and evaluate if several commercially available stents are able to resolve vasospasm. RESULTS The model predicts that dilatation of VSMCs beyond a threshold of mechanical failure is sufficient to resolve CVS without damage to the underlying extracellular matrix. Consistent with recent clinical observations, our model predicts that existing stents have the potential to provide sufficient outward force to successfully treat CVS and that success will be dependent on an appropriate match between stent and vessel. CONCLUSION Mathematical models of CVS can provide insights into biological mechanisms and explore treatment approaches. Improved understanding of the underlying mechanistic processes governing CVS and its mechanical treatment may assist in the development of dedicated stents.","Bhogal, P; Pederzani, G; Grytsan, A; Loh, Y; Brouwer, P A; Andersson, T; Gundiah, Namrata; Robertson, Anne M; Watton, Paul N; Söderman, Michael",Clinical neuroradiology,90,16

The aim of this prospective, questionnaire-based study was to survey students' use of drawing in various aspects of veterinary anatomy learning (self-study, examinations, preparation for and reflection on cadaver dissection). The quantitative data showed that first year students with artistic preferences used drawing significantly more often in most aspects of anatomy learning than students with no such preferences, apart from the reported use of drawing in examinations and for reflection after cadaver dissection. The lack of significant correlations of the reported use of drawing in examinations with any other study variable, provided support for the author's observation that student-generated drawings are not as commonly used in examinations as previously. In contrast to the study hypothesis, previous university studies did not correlate significantly with any aspect of the use of drawing in anatomy learning. None of the reported uses of drawing addressed the benefits of drawing in learning comparative anatomy of animal species, a characteristic distinguishing veterinary anatomy from human anatomy. Qualitative student feedback indicated that encouragement and teacher-produced images would increase the use of drawing as a learning approach even if implementation of drawing into the curriculum is not feasible. Conclusions from this study were implemented through self-directed learning in anatomy courses that replaced the cancelled cadaveric dissections during the Covid-19 outbreak and also through the ongoing drawing workshops to further advance the use of drawing in veterinary anatomy learning.","Laakkonen, Juha",Anatomical sciences education,90,27

It also investigated whether students’ educational level or teachers’ computer skills significantly affected teachers’ views. The study applied the mixed-method approach, whereby a questionnaire was distributed to a random sample of 384 teachers, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with five teachers. Quantitative data were analyzed via appropriate statistical methods, while thematic analysis was used to interpret the interviews and comments. The quantitative and qualitative results indicated that MEP and its tools are effective and appropriate. Technical problems, internet interruptions and difficulties with evaluating students' learning represented the most common challenges. Teachers’ suggestions focused on solving technical problems, increasing internet speed, providing internet incentive packages, training teachers and educating parents. The quantitative results demonstrated significant differences amongst teachers’ views of the challenges in favor of elementary school teachers, and the qualitative results showed that some elementary school teachers oppose distance learning at this stage. The outcomes revealed significant differences amongst teachers with respect to their views of MEP’s effectiveness and challenges stemming from their varied computer skills. © 2021, Scientific Journal of King Faisal University Basic and Applied Sciences.

Consistently, structural abnormalities in the olfactory bulb (OB), a key region of the peripheral olfactory system, have also been reported in psychotic disorders. Meanwhile, air pollution and viral infections in the upper respiratory tract, including those of SARS-CoV-2, are reportedly risk factors for brain dysfunction and mental disorders. These risk factors can disturb the olfactory epithelium (OE) that is located adjacent to the OB and connected via direct neuronal projections. Nevertheless, it is unknown how a disturbance of the OE possibly affects the OB in the pathophysiological context of psychotic disorders. Methods We examined the volume of the OB in FEP patients and healthy controls from 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging and molecular expression profiles of olfactory neuronal cells (ONCs) enriched from freshly biopsied OE. Results We observed a reduction of the OB volume in FEP patients compared with healthy controls. We also observed a significant alteration in gene expression profiles in the ONCs from FEP patients, supporting the pathological changes in the OE. Among such molecular changes, immune-related molecules and pathways were underscored in association with the OB volume changes in FEP patients. Conclusions Our data support the OB and OE pathologies in FEP patients. Immune-related molecular changes in the OE can biologically link adverse factors in the nasal cavity, such as air pollution and viral infection, with the OB structural change, both of which have been reported for psychotic disorders.","Yang, Kun; Hua, Jun; Etyemez, Semra; Paez, Adrian; Prasad, Neal; Ishizuka, Koko; Sawa, Akira; Kamath, Vidyulata",bioRxiv,90,20

The initiative was co-designed by the rural health nurse from a community clinic of the Hauora (Māori health provider) and the principal of the local area school. The intent was to improve health literacy and provide an environment to support the students to consent to vaccination. 37 of 44 students in the cohort engaged with the initiative and had their first HPV vaccination, and the coverage rate for the full course was 79%, exceeding the national target. The success of this vaccination programme led us to undertake an evaluation of the initiative which we report here. We undertook the evaluation in 2018, which included 10 key informant interviews and a group discussion with eight male students. Factors that were identified as being important in improving access to information and improving coverage rates included supporting established community relationships;shared values and vision for the community;and tailoring the initiative to achieve the ""right"" engagement context for male students.","McLelland, Hinemoa PGDiploma R.

This change deeply impacted typical working routines, affecting both well-being and productivity. Moreover, this pandemic will have long-lasting effects in the software industry, with several tech companies allowing their employees to work from home indefinitely if they wish to do so. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze and understand how a typical working day looks like when working from home and how individual activities affect software developers' well-being and productivity. We performed a two-wave longitudinal study involving almost 200 globally carefully selected software professionals, inferring daily activities with perceived well-being, productivity, and other relevant psychological and social variables. Results suggest that the time software engineers spent doing specific activities from home was similar when working in the office. However, we also found some significant mean differences. The amount of time developers spent on each activity was unrelated to their well-being. perceived productivity, and other variables.

This paper reports an initiative by designers and engineers in the UK and China. The case study approach and content analysis method were used to study the stakeholders, the design process, and other relevant issues such as regulation. Good practice and lessons were summarised, and suggestions for using distributed 3D printing to supply PPEs were made. It concludes that 3D printing has played an important role in producing PPEs when there was a shortage of supply, and distributed manufacturing has the potential to quickly respond to local small-bench production needs. In the future, clearer specification, better match of demands and supply, and quicker evaluation against relevant regulations will provide efficiency and quality assurance for 3D printed PPE supplies. © 2020 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

Neuropsychopharmacology courses are often popular amongst undergraduate students, but it can be a challenge to find ways to connect the theoretical issues discussed in the classroom to the real world, and convey the complexities of research on substance use. This article describes a partnership between a 300-level ""Drugs & Behavior"" laboratory course and a local not-for-profit anti-drug coalition focused on drug education and prevention. A series of semester-long service-learning projects were developed that met instructional objectives and coalition goals. Briefly, students applied critical thinking and analytical skills to survey data on substance use, collected from local 6-12th grade students, that would inform coalition programming. By the end of the semester, students had produced scientific reports of the data, developed informational summaries for community distribution, and wrote a mock grant proposal incorporating proposed improvements to the study. During the semester, students reflected on the SL experience and took surveys on SL outcomes. Findings suggested that this SL opportunity helped students make connections between course content and the real world, enhanced skills or awareness in ways that added value to the course, challenged them to understand a problem and generate solutions, and expanded their thinking regarding their ability to help tackle substance use-related issues in the community. Suggestions for implementation and refinement of this experience are offered.","Cammack, Katharine M; Melton, Chasity","Journal of undergraduate neuroscience education : JUNE : a publication of FUN, Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience",90,33

Pulmonary pathology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).,13.4415245,11.333998,2003,"BACKGROUND An ongoing issue in transfusion medicine is whether newly identified or emerging pathogens can be transmitted by transfusion. One method to study this question is through the use of a contemporary linked donor-recipient repository. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study Allogeneic Donor and Recipient (RADAR) repository was established between 2000 and 2003 by seven blood centers and eight collaborating hospitals. Specimens from consented donors were collected, components from their donations were routed to participating hospitals, and recipients of these units gave enrollment and follow-up specimens for long-term storage. The repository was designed to show that zero transmissions to enrolled recipients would indicate with 95 percent confidence that the transfusion transmission rate of an agent with prevalence of 0.05 to 1 percent was lower than 25 percent. RESULTS The repository contains pre- and posttransfusion specimens from 3,575 cardiac, vascular, and orthopedic surgery patients, linked to 13,201 donation specimens. The mean number of RADAR donation exposures per recipient is 3.85. The distribution of components transfused is 77 percent red cells, 13 percent whole blood-derived platelet concentrates, and 10 percent fresh frozen plasma. A supplementary unlinked donation repository containing 99,906 specimens from 84,339 donors was also established and can be used to evaluate the prevalence of an agent and validate assay(s) performance before accessing the donor-recipient-linked repository. Recipient testing conducted during the establishment of RADAR revealed no transmissions of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, or human T-lymphotropic virus. CONCLUSIONS RADAR is a contemporary donor-recipient repository that can be accessed to study the transfusion transmissibility of emerging agents.","Kleinman, S H; Glynn, S A; Higgins, M J; Triulzi, D J; Smith, J W; Nass, C C; Garratty, George; Murphy, E L; LeParc, G F; Schreiber, G B; King, M R; Chamberland, M E; Nemo, G J",Transfusion,90,9

METHOD We examined 9815 religiously active California Mormon adults followed for mortality during 1980-2004 and 15,832 representative U.S. white adults enrolled in the 1987 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and followed for mortality during 1988-1997. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated relative to U.S. whites defined to have a SMR of 1.00. RESULTS Active California Mormons practice a healthy lifestyle advocated by their religion, which emphasizes a strong family life, education and abstention from tobacco and alcohol. Unusually low SMRs occurred among married never smokers who attended church weekly and had at least 12 years of education. For those aged 25-99 years at entry, the SMR for all causes of death was 0.45 (0.42-0.48) for males and 0.55 (0.51-0.59) for females. For those aged 25-64 years at entry, the SMR for all causes of death was 0.36 (0.32-0.41) for males and 0.46 (0.40-0.53) for females. Life expectancy from age 25 was 84 years for males and 86 years for females. These SMRs were largely replicated among similarly defined persons of all religions within the NHIS cohort.

Peripheral white blood cells (WBCs), the neutrophil (NEU)-to-lymphocyte (LYM) ratio (NLR), the platelet-to-lymphocyte (PLR) ratio, and hemoglobin (Hb) are markers of systematic inflammatory reaction and often predict disease severity. Objective The current study intended to examine the prognostic importance of hemoglobin (Hb), total leukocyte count (TLC), absolute neutrophile count (ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), NLR, d-NLR [derived NLR = ANC/(WBC-ANC)], absolute platelet count (APC), and PLR, based on complete blood counts (CBCs) for COVID-19 patients. Design The research team designed a retrospective that was conducted between March 27 and June 5, 2020, after the first COVID-19 case was reported in Ajmer, Rajasthan, India on March 27. Setting The study took place at Jawaharlal Nehru (JLN) Medical College in Ajmer, Rajasthan, India. Participants The study included 364 participants who were all COVID-positive patients who came to the hospital during the study's period, including patients from various age groups and of both genders. Outcome Measures Using the results of the CBC, the research team measured: (1) Hb in g/dl, (2) ANC, (3) ALC, and (4) APC. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were calculated from measurements of the levels of the circulating biomarkers, as cells × 103/μl. Result For participants who were severely symptomatic, the mean age was 57.86 ± 8.92. Males were more likely to experience severe symptoms. Participants' Hb values were significantly different between groups, and TLC, ANC, NLR, d-NLR, and PLR were highest in the severely symptomatic group and lowest in the asymptomatic group. NLR was positively associated with a risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, while Hb was negatively associated with development of pneumonia. Conclusions Disease severity and age are independent predictors of poor outcomes. The NLR should be used as a routine blood test that can help in the diagnosis of disease severity in COVID-19. NLR is very simple tool that can be used as a fast and low-cost test that is easily available, even in small centers where the facilities for other tests, such as tests of LDH, CRP, and IL-6, and high resolution CT scans aren't available. Thus, NLR can be used as single independent predictor of COVID-19 disease severity.","Kumar Gothwal, Sunil; Singh, V B; Shrivastava, Mayank; Banseria, Ruchita; Goyal, Kanika; Singh, Saranshi; Ali, Haider; Saad Alharbi, Khalid; Singh, Yogendra; Gupta, Gaurav",Alternative therapies in health and medicine,90,12

Refractory or recurrent bleeding was present in 8 of 18 (44.4%), 4 of 11 (36.4%), and 4 of 8 (50.0%) patients, and prolapse was reported by 1 of 18 (5.6%), 4 of 11 (36.4%), and 1/7 (14.3%) of patients at 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively. Bleeding improved from baseline in 88.2%, 81.8%, and 87.5% of patients, and resolution of baseline prolapse was seen in 11 of 11 (100%), 4 of 7 (57.1%), and 5 of 5 (100%) patients at the same intervals. Thirteen of 18 (72.2%) patients did not require additional treatment for their symptoms. Conclusions The HET Bipolar System is safe and easy to use with short-term effectiveness comparable to that of currently used techniques for the treatment of symptomatic grade I and II internal hemorrhoids. It may be an effective alternative to rubber band ligation in patients with larger internal hemorrhoids and those with hemorrhoids close to the dentate line in which banding may produce debilitating pain.","Crawshaw, Benjamin P; Russ, Andrew J; Ermlich, Bridget O; Delaney, Conor P; Champagne, Bradley J",Surgical innovation,90,7

Background Molecular studies, especially proteomics, can be considered as suitable approaches for discovering the hidden aspect of the disease. Methods Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) of three patients with demonstrated severe condition (S-COVID-19) were compared to healthy cases by a proteomics study. Cytoscape software and STRING database were used to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The central DEPs were identified through topological analysis of the network. ClueGO+CluePedia were applied to find the biological processes related to the central nodes. MCODE molecular complex detection (MCODE) was used to discover protein complexes. Results A total of 242 DEPs from among 256 query ones were included in the network. Centrality analysis of the network assigned 16 hub-bottlenecks, nine of which were presented in the highest-scored protein complex. Ten protein complexes were determined. APOA1 was identified as the protein complex seed, and APP, EGF, and C3 were the top hub-bottlenecks of the network. The results specify that up-regulation of C3 and down-regulation of APOA1 in urine play a role in the stiffness in respiration and, accordingly, the severity of COVID-19. Moreover, dysregulation of APP and APOA1 could both contribute to the possible adverse effects of COVID-19 on the nervous system. Conclusion The introduced central proteins of the S-COVID-19 interaction network, particularly APOA1, can be considered as diagnostic and therapeutic targets related to the coronavirus disease after being approved with complementary studies.","Zamanian Azodi, Mona; Arjmand, Babak; Zali, Alireza; Razzaghi, Mohammadreza",Gastroenterology and hepatology from bed to bench,90,1

However, the mechanism by which HIV-1 mediates its deleterious effects in the brain is poorly defined. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of the HIV-1 tat gene on the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in human U373MG astroglial cells and primary astroglia. Expression of the tat gene as RSV-tat but not that of the CAT gene as RSV-CAT in U373MG astroglial cells led to the induction of NO production and the expression of iNOS protein and mRNA. Induction of NO production by recombinant HIV-1 Tat protein and inhibition of RSV-tat-induced NO production by anti-Tat antibodies suggest that RSV-tat-induced production of NO is dependent on Tat and that Tat is secreted from RSV-tat-transfected astroglia. Similar to U373MG astroglial cells, RSV-tat also induced the production of NO in human primary astroglia. The induction of human iNOS promoter-derived luciferase activity by the expression of RSV-tat suggests that RSV-tat induces the transcription of iNOS. To understand the mechanism of induction of iNOS, we investigated the role of NF-kappaB and C/EBPbeta, transcription factors responsible for the induction of iNOS. Activation of NF-kappaB as well as C/EBPbeta by RSV-tat, stimulation of RSV-tat-induced production of NO by the wild type of p65 and C/EBPbeta, and inhibition of RSV-tat-induced production of NO by deltap65, a dominant-negative mutant of p65, and deltaC/EBPbeta, a dominant-negative mutant of C/EBPbeta, suggest that RSV-tat induces iNOS through the activation of NF-kappaB and C/EBPbeta. In addition, we show that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) but not that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is involved in RSV-tat induced production of NO. Interestingly, PD98059, an inhibitor of the ERK pathway, and deltaERK2, a dominant-negative mutant of ERK2, inhibited RSV-tat-induced production of NO through the inhibition of C/EBPbeta but not that of NF-kappaB. This study illustrates a novel role for HIV-1 tat in inducing the expression of iNOS in human astrocytes that may participate in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated dementia.","Liu, Xiaojuan; Jana, Malabendu; Dasgupta, Subhajit; Koka, Sreenivas; He, Jun; Wood, Charles; Pahan, Kalipada",The Journal of biological chemistry,90,33

In a phase II trial, infants will be randomised to visible cerebral NIRS oximetry with pre-specified treatment guidelines compared to standard care with blinded NIRS-monitoring. The primary outcome is duration multiplied with the extent outside the normal range of regional tissue oxygen saturation of haemoglobin (rStO2) of 55 to 85% in percentage hours (burden). This study was a pilot of the Visible -Oximetry Group. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was an observational study including ten infants. RESULTS The median gestational age was 26 weeks+three days, and the median start-up time was 133 minutes after delivery. The median recording time was 69.7 hours, mean rStO2 was 64.2±4.5%, median burden of hyper- and hypoxia was 30.3% hours (range 2.8-112.3). Clinical staff responded to an out of range value 29 times--only once to values above 85%. In comparison, there were 83 periods of more than ten minutes with an rStO2 below 55% and four episodes with an rStO2 above 85%. These periods accounted for 72% of the total hypoxia burden. A total of 18 of the 29 interventions were adjustments of FiO2 which in 13 of the 18 times resulted in an out-of-range SpO2. Two infants suffered second-degree burns from the sensor. Five infants died. In all cases, this was unrelated to NIRS monitoring and treatment. CONCLUSION The intervention of early cerebral NIRS monitoring proved feasible, but prolonged periods of hypoxia went untreated. Thus, a revision of the treatment guideline and an alarm system is required. FUNDING The Elsass Foundation funded the present study.

By July 8, 2003, a total of 71 cases had been reported to CDC from 6 states. When emerging infectious diseases are reported in the United States, particularly when these reports receive widespread media attention, obstetrician-gynecologists may be called upon to rapidly respond to queries from their patients and to address certain infectious disease risks within their clinical practices. In addition, obstetrician-gynecologists may have specific concerns about the implications for an infectious disease outbreak, such as monkeypox, for pregnant women. Therefore, it is important that obstetrician-gynecologists know how to gather up-to-date and accurate information about infectious disease outbreaks and that they be familiar with the public health response system for responding to such outbreaks.","Jamieson, Denise J; Cono, Joanne; Richards, Chesley L; Treadwell, Tracee A",Obstetrics and gynecology,90,19

There is no universally accepted diagnostic test that is absolute or reliable for detection of PJI. Recent research has raised doubt regarding the utility of various inflammatory markers in diagnosis. The aim of study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of interleukin- 6 (IL-6) and other inflammatory markers; C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and white blood cell count (WBC) in the diagnosis of PJI. The study group included 40 patients (21 males, 19 females) admitted for surgical intervention after knee or hip arthroplasties. Patients were subjected to careful history taking, thorough clinical examination and preoperative laboratory investigations including serum IL-6, CRP, WBC and ESR. Peri-implant tissue specimens were subjected to microbiological culture and histopathological examination. The mean age of the studied patients was (58.4 year) (range, 38-72 years). Intraoperative cultures and histopathological examination revealed that 11 patients had been infected (PJI), and 29 patients were aseptic failure of the prosthesis. Four presumed markers of infection were tested preoperatively: ESR; CRP; WBC; and IL-6. Results showed that ESR (p = 0.0001), CRP (P=0.004), WBC (0.0001), and IL-6 (P = 0.0001) were significantly higher in patients with septic revision arthroplasty than those with aseptic failure of the prosthesis both among patients with hip arthroplasty and those with knee arthroplasty. Serum IL-6 (> 10.4 pg/ml) reportedly had a sensitivity (100%), a specificity (90.9%), a PPV (79%), a NPV (100%), and accuracy (92.5%). In conclusions, the present study demonstrated that IL-6 was the most accurate laboratory marker for diagnosing PJI when compared to ESR, CRP, and WBC. We also found that IL-6 above 10.4 pg/ml and CRP level above 18 mg/L identified all patients with PJI and the combination of CRP+ IL-6 was an excellent screening test to identify all such patients (sensitivity 100%, NPV 100%).","Abou El-Khier, Noha Tharwat; El Ganainy, Abd El-Rhman; Elgeidy, Adham; Rakha, Shirien Amin",The Egyptian journal of immunology,90,21

The discovery of important vitamin D properties on the innate and adaptive immune system created a lot of interest in a potential role of vitamin D on diseases characterized by heightened inflammation and oxidative response, and impaired antimicrobial response, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Recent studies have demonstrated that vitamin D and its deficiency have a number of biological effects which are potentially important in altering the pathogenesis and severity of both asthma and COPD.

In addition to improved utilisation of oral anticoagulants (OACs) for stroke prevention, reports of switching among OACs are growing in the literature; switching may influence clinical outcomes, healthcare costs and patient satisfaction. This review aimed to summarise the current literature on the pattern of OAC switching in patients with AF, including reasons for switching and clinical consequences following switching. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Embase on Jun 27, 2020. We included 39 articles published after 2013, following the introduction of apixaban. The review found that switching among OACs was common in clinical practice, significantly varying with the type of OAC. Studies reporting the reason for switching and clinical outcomes were comparatively limited. The decision to switch was often related to safety issues (usually bleeding), poor anticoagulation control and ease-of-use. Patient characteristics, clinical conditions and drug interactions were found to be associated with switching from OACs. Findings regarding bleeding outcomes following switching were inconsistent, possibly confounded by the rationale for switching and the switching protocol. Noting the limited number of studies included and their relatively short follow-up periods, switching did not have a significant impact on the risk of stroke and other thrombotic outcomes. Further prospective studies are needed to understand better potential rationales for switching and the clinical outcomes.","Kefale, Adane Teshome; Peterson, Gregory M; Bezabhe, Woldesellassie M; Bereznicki, Luke R",,90,16

The evolution of equilibrium and dynamic properties with NP loading, total packing fraction, and strength of interfacial attraction is systematically studied based on a minimalist model. Structural predictions of polymer reference interaction site model integral equation theory are employed to establish the rich behavior of the interfacial cohesive force density, surface excess, and a measure of free volume as a function of PNC variables. The glassy dynamic shear modulus is predicted to be softened, reinforced, or hardly changed relative to the pure polymer melt depending on system parameters, as a result of the competing and qualitatively different influences of interfacial cohesion (physical bonding), free volume, and entropic depletion on dynamic localization and shear elasticity. The localization of polymer segments is the dominant factor in determining bulk PNC softening and reinforcement effects for moderate to strong interfacial attractions, respectively. While in the athermal entropy-dominated regime, the primary origin of mechanical reinforcement is the stress stored in the aggregated NP subsystem. The PNC shear modulus is often qualitatively correlated with the segment localization length but with notable exceptions. The present work provides the foundation for developing a theory of segmental relaxation, Tg changes, and collective NP dynamics in PNCs based on a self-consistent treatment of the cooperative activated motions of segments and NPs.","Zhou, Yuxing; Schweizer, Kenneth S",J Chem Phys,90,11

In these situations, it is common for people to draw on their religious or spiritual faith to cope with their pain and struggle. One construct that has received increased attention within the field of religious/spiritual coping is spiritual fortitude (SF). SF refers to one's ability to draw on spiritual resources to transcend negative emotions in the face of stressors (Van Tongeren et al., 2019). In this review, we analyze eight empirical studies with 3,455 total participants. Specifically, we explore the relationship between SF and mental health and well-being, with a particular focus on its role in traumatic contexts (e.g., natural disasters). SF has been found to demonstrate a series of positive mental health benefits including higher meaning in life, spiritual well-being, positive religious coping, and perceived posttraumatic growth. We discuss areas for future research and implications for clinical practice, with specific consideration to coping with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here, we show that macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) senses renal tubular cell death to induce sustained inflammation after acute kidney injury in mice. Mincle-deficient mice were protected against tissue damage and subsequent atrophy of the kidney after ischemia-reperfusion injury. Using lipophilic extract from the injured kidney, we identified ß-glucosylceramide as an endogenous Mincle ligand. Notably, free cholesterol markedly enhanced the agonistic effect of ß-glucosylceramide on Mincle. Moreover, ß-glucosylceramide and free cholesterol accumulated in dead renal tubules in proximity to Mincle-expressing macrophages, where Mincle was supposed to inhibit clearance of dead cells and increase proinflammatory cytokine production. This study demonstrates that ß-glucosylceramide in combination with free cholesterol acts on Mincle as an endogenous ligand to induce cell death-triggered, sustained inflammation after acute kidney injury.","Tanaka, Miyako; Saka-Tanaka, Marie; Ochi, Kozue; Fujieda, Kumiko; Sugiura, Yuki; Miyamoto, Tomofumi; Kohda, Hiro; Ito, Ayaka; Miyazawa, Taiki; Matsumoto, Akira; Aoe, Seiichiro; Miyamoto, Yoshihiro; Tsuboi, Naotake; Maruyama, Shoichi; Suematsu, Makoto; Yamasaki, Sho; Ogawa, Yoshihiro; Suganami, Takayoshi",J. exp. med,90,20

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the asthma prevalence among patients with COVID-19 and compare outcomes between patients with and without asthma. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, bioRxiv, and medRxiv for studies reporting asthma prevalence in general patients with COVID-19 or comparing outcomes between patients with and without asthma, and excluded duplicate publications, reviews, editorials, comments, single case reports, or small case series (<10 cases). We determined the pooled estimates of effect using random-effect model. RESULTS: On the basis of 131 studies (410,382 patients), we found great variability in the prevalence of comorbid asthma among patients with COVID-19 in different countries or regions ranging from 1.1% to 16.9%. No significant difference in asthma prevalence was found between hospitalized and nonhospitalized (risk ratio [RR], 1.15; 95% CI, 0.92-1.43), severe and nonsevere (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.92-1.57), intensive care unit and non-intensive care unit (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.92-1.54), dead and survived (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.73-1.11), intubated/mechanically ventilated and nonintubated/mechanically ventilated (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.71-1.17) patients with COVID-19. Patients with asthma have a lower risk of death compared with patients without asthma (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.43-0.98). Asthma is not associated with a higher risk of intubation or mechanical ventilation (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.72-1.46). CONCLUSIONS: There is great variability in asthma prevalence among patients with COVID-19 in different countries or regions.

AIM: To examine whether use of HFNC increases near-field aerosols and whether there is an association with flow rate. METHODS: Subjects aged four weeks to 24 months were recruited. Each child received HFNC therapy at different flow rates. Three stations with particle counters were deployed to measure particle concentrations and dispersion in the room: station 1 within 0.5 m, station 2 at 2 m, and station 3 on the other side of the room. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and relative humidity were measured. Far-field measurements were used to adjust the near-field measurements. FINDINGS: Ten children were enrolled, aged from 6 to 24 months (median: 9). Elevated CO2 indicated that the near-field measurements were in the breathing plane. Near-field breathing plane concentrations of aerosols with diameter 0.3-10 µm were elevated by the presence of the patient with no HFNC flow, relative to the room far-field, by 0.45 particles/cm3. Whereas variability between subjects in their emission and dispersion of particles was observed, no association was found between HFNC use, at any flow rate, and near-field particle counts. CONCLUSION: This method of particle sampling is feasible in hospital settings; correcting the near-patient aerosol and CO2 levels for the room far-field may provide proxies of exposure risk to pathogens generated. In this pilot, near-patient levels of particles with a diameter between 0.3 and 10 µm and CO2 were not affected by the use of HFNC.","Gall, E T; Laguerre, A; Noelck, M; Van Meurs, A; Austin, J P; Foster, B A",J Hosp Infect,90,1

Despite their efficacy in clinical trials, data on mRNA vaccine-induced immune responses are mostly limited to serological analyses. Here, we interrogated antibody and antigen-specific memory B cells over time in 33 SARS-CoV-2 naïve and 11 SARS-CoV-2 recovered subjects. SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals required both vaccine doses for optimal increases in antibodies, particularly for neutralizing titers against the B.1.351 variant. Memory B cells specific for full-length spike protein and the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) were also efficiently primed by mRNA vaccination and detectable in all SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects after the second vaccine dose, though the memory B cell response declined slightly with age. In SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals, antibody and memory B cell responses were significantly boosted after the first vaccine dose; however, there was no increase in circulating antibodies, neutralizing titers, or antigen-specific memory B cells after the second dose. This robust boosting after the first vaccine dose strongly correlated with levels of pre-existing memory B cells in recovered individuals, identifying a key role for memory B cells in mounting recall responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Together, our data demonstrated robust serological and cellular priming by mRNA vaccines and revealed distinct responses based on prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, whereby COVID-19 recovered subjects may only require a single vaccine dose to achieve peak antibody and memory B cell responses. These findings also highlight the utility of defining cellular responses in addition to serologies and may inform SARS-CoV-2 vaccine distribution in a resource-limited setting.","Goel, Rishi R; Apostolidis, Sokratis A; Painter, Mark M; Mathew, Divij; Pattekar, Ajinkya; Kuthuru, Oliva; Gouma, Sigrid; Hicks, Philip; Meng, Wenzhao; Rosenfeld, Aaron M; Dysinger, Sarah; Lundgreen, Kendall A; Kuri-Cervantes, Leticia; Adamski, Sharon; Hicks, Amanda; Korte, Scott; Oldridge, Derek A; Baxter, Amy E; Giles, Josephine R; Weirick, Madison E; McAllister, Christopher M; Dougherty, Jeanette; Long, Sherea; D039,; Andrea, Kurt; Hamilton, Jacob T; Betts, Michael R; Luning Prak, Eline T; Bates, Paul; Hensley, Scott E; Greenplate, Allison R; Wherry, E John",Sci. immunol,90,16

Results: The response rate was 37.4% (58 of 155). Overall, 84.5% reported an effect of COVID-19 on SOT in Europe. In 49% of these, limited capacity was mentioned, and in 51% the reason for restricted resources was strategic preparedness. As a result, SOT was totally or partially suspended for several weeks. In sum, 93.1% of centers implemented protective measures against COVID-19. Nongovernmental information policies were felt to be adequate in 90%. Continuation of transplant activities was desired by 97% of centers. Conclusion: The results of this survey suggested a need for more ICU capacity during COVID-19, in order to guarantee adequate and timely treatment of other patient cohorts in surveyed countries.","Kniepeiss, D.; Jantscher, L.; Al-Sharafy, S.; Sendlhofer, G.; Schemmer, P.",Risk Management &amp; Healthcare Policy,90,1

Platelets are chiefly implicated in thrombosis. Moreover, they can interact with viruses and are an important source of inflammatory mediators. While a lower platelet count is associated with severity and mortality, little is known about platelet function during COVID-19. Objective: To evaluate the contribution of platelets to inflammation and thrombosis in COVID-19 patients. Methods and Results: Blood was collected from 115 consecutive COVID-19 patients presenting non-severe (n=71) and severe (n=44) respiratory symptoms. We document the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA associated with platelets of COVID-19 patients. Exhaustive assessment of cytokines in plasma and in platelets revealed the modulation of platelet-associated cytokine levels in both non-severe and severe COVID-19 patients, pointing to a direct contribution of platelets to the plasmatic cytokine load. Moreover, we demonstrate that platelets release their alpha- and dense-granule contents in both non-severe and severe forms of COVID-19. In comparison to concentrations measured in healthy volunteers, phosphatidylserine-exposing platelet extracellular vesicles were increased in non-severe, but not in severe cases of COVID-19. Levels of D-dimers, a marker of thrombosis, failed to correlate with any measured indicators of platelet activation. Functionally, platelets were hyperactivated in COVID-19 subjects presenting non-severe and severe symptoms, with aggregation occurring at suboptimal thrombin concentrations. Furthermore, platelets adhered more efficiently onto collagen-coated surfaces under flow conditions. Conclusions: Taken together, the data suggest that platelets are at the frontline of COVID-19 pathogenesis, as they release various sets of molecules through the different stages of the disease. Platelets may thus have the potential to contribute to the overwhelming thrombo-inflammation in COVID-19, and the inhibition of pathways related to platelet activation may improve the outcomes during COVID-19.","Zaid, Younes; Puhm, Florian; Allaeys, Isabelle; Naya, Abdallah; Oudghiri, Mounia; Khalki, Loubna; Limami, Youness; Zaid, Nabil; Sadki, Khalid; Ben El Haj, Rafiqua; Mahir, Wissal; Belayachi, Lamiae; Belefquih, Bouchra; Benouda, Amina; Cheikh, Amine; Langlois, Marc-André; Cherrah, Yahia; Flamand, Louis; Guessous, Fadila; Boilard, Eric",Circ. res,90,16

Deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems have strong, parallel gradients of nutrients and environmental stress, and present unusual conditions in early succession, in that both nutrient availability and stressors are high. We analyzed the succession of the invertebrate community at 9°50'N on the East Pacific Rise for 11 years following an eruption in 2006 in order to test successional theories developed in other ecosystems. We focused on functional traits including body size, external protection, provision of habitat (foundation species), and trophic mode to understand how the unique nutritional and stress conditions influence community composition. In contrast to established theory, large, fast-growing, structure-forming organisms colonized rapidly at vents, while small, asexually reproducing organisms were not abundant until later in succession. Species in early succession had high external protection, as expected in the harsh thermal and chemical conditions after the eruption. Changes in traits related to feeding ecology and dispersal potential over succession agreed with expectations from other ecosystems. We also tracked functional diversity metrics over time to see how they compared to species diversity. While species diversity peaked at 8 years post-eruption, functional diversity was continuing to increase at 11 years. Our results indicate that deep-sea hydrothermal vents have distinct successional dynamics due to the high stress and high nutrient conditions in early succession. These findings highlight the importance of extending theory to new systems, and considering function to allow comparison between ecosystems with different species and environmental conditions.","Dykman, Lauren N; Beaulieu, Stace E; Mills, Susan W; Solow, Andrew R; Mullineaux, Lauren S",Ecology,90,16

However, little is known about the magnitude of these psychological effects on a population level and for vulnerable subgroups. METHODS: A representative sample (N = 2503; 50.2% female; mean age = 49.5) of the German population was assessed face-to-face during the COVID-19 pandemic (February 10-April 25, 2020). They were examined for differences in mental health (BSI-18) and relationship quality (PFB) in a pre-lockdown and lockdown subsamples. After testing and establishing the measurement models in confirmatory factor analyses, we added covariates as predictors of the factors to the regression model to investigate the impact of the lockdown measures. RESULTS: Overall, participants included after the introduction of lockdown measures reported significantly fewer mental health problems than participants included before the lockdown. Predictor analyses revealed that this effect was larger for participants of younger age and those with higher household income. There was no significant difference in relationship quality between pre-lockdown and lockdown. However, relationship quality improved for younger participants after the lockdown measures started, but deteriorated for older participants. CONCLUSIONS: The German population was found to be largely resilient to the immediate effects of lockdown on mental health and relationship quality. Older participants and those with lower socio-economic status might constitute risk groups during times of lockdown. Further studies in countries affected by more drastic lockdown measures and the long-term consequences of the pandemic are needed to inform decision makers about the psychological effects of lockdown.","Sachser, Cedric; Olaru, Gabriel; Pfeiffer, Elisa; Brähler, Elmar; Clemens, Vera; Rassenhofer, Miriam; Witt, Andreas; Fegert, Jörg M",Soc Sci Med,90,6

It is crucial in this phase to understand what should countries which presently lag behind in the spread of the infection learn from countries where the infection spread earlier. The choice of this work is to prefer timeliness to comprehensiveness. By adopting a purely empirical approach, we will limit ourselves to identifying different phases in the plots of different countries, based on their different functional behaviour, and to make a comparative analysis. The comparative analysis of the registered cases curves highlights remarkable similarities, especially among Western countries, together with some minor but crucial differences. We highlight how timeliness can largely reduce the size of the individual national outbreaks, ultimately limiting the final death toll. Our data suggest that Western governments have not unfortunately shown the capability to anticipate their decisions, based on the experience of countries hit earlier by the outbreak.","Granozio, Fabio Miletto",,90,15

However, few research has been performed on the prediction of disease progression in particular group of patients in the early stages of COVID-19. METHODS: The study included 338 patients with COVID-19 treated at two hospitals in Wuhan, China, from December 2019 to March 2020. Predictors of the progression of COVID-19 from mild to severe stages were selected by the logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: COVID-19 progression to severe and critical stages was confirmed in 78 (23.1%) patients. The average value of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was higher in patients in the disease progression group than in the improvement group. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that elevated NLR, LDH and IL-10 were independent predictors of disease progression. The optimal cut-off value of NLR was 3.75. The values of the area under the curve, reflecting the accuracy of predicting COVID-19 progression by NLR was 0.739 (95%CI: 0.605-0.804). The risk model based on NLR, LDH and IL-10 had the highest area under the ROC curve. CONCLUSIONS: The performed analysis demonstrates that high concentrations of NLR, LDH and IL-10 were independent risk factors for predicting disease progression in patients at the early stage of COVID-19. The risk model combined with NLR, LDH and IL-10 improved the accuracy of the prediction of disease progression in patients in the early stages of COVID-19.","Xu, Jianjun; Gao, Yang; Hu, Shaobo; Li, Suzhen; Wang, Weimin; Wu, Yuzhe; Su, Zhe; Zhou, Xing; Cheng, Xiang; Zheng, Qichang",Ann Clin Biochem,90,32

Kv7.1-KCNE1 channels produce the slow-delayed rectifying K+ current, IKs, which is important during the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. Kv7.2-7.5 are predominantly neuronally expressed and constitute the muscarinic M-current and control the resting membrane potential in neurons. Kv7.1 produces drastically different currents as a result of modulation by KCNE subunits. This flexibility allows the Kv7.1 channel to have many roles depending on location and assembly partners. The pharmacological sensitivity of Kv7.1 channels differs from that of Kv7.2-7.5 and is largely dependent upon the number of ß-subunits present in the channel complex. As a result, the development of pharmaceuticals targeting Kv7.1 is problematic. This review discusses the roles and the mechanisms by which different signaling pathways affect Kv7.1 and KCNE channels and could potentially provide different ways of targeting the channel.

The population were young people and adults who resided in the cities of Lima and Callao (Perú) during the declaration of the national health emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, during the period from March 16 to 27, 2020, who were recruited through a non-probability sample. The PRE-COVID-19, the WHO-Five Well-Being Index, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-2 and a single item were applied to measure the general perception of health. The scales were shared using a Google form through social networks. An internal consistency reliability analysis and structural equation models were performed, specifically confirmatory factor analysis. The recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles that guide the ethical practice of online studies were followed. RESULTS: Eight hundred and sixteen young people and adults from Lima and Callao (200 men and 616 women; mean age 28.40, SD 7.10) participated.

In this study, we employed two bivalve molluscan species from the genus Ruditapes as sentinel organisms to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 signals in the marine coastal environment. Estuarine sediments from the natural clam banks were also analyzed. Viral RNA was detected by RT-qPCR, targeting IP4, E and N1 genomic regions. Positive samples were also subjected to a PMAxx-triton viability RT-qPCR assay in order to discriminate between intact and altered capsids, obtaining indirect information about the viability of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 RNA traces were detected in 9/12 clam samples by RT-qPCR, from which 4 were positive for two different target regions. Viral quantification ranged from <LoQ to 4.48 Log genomic copies/g of digestive tissue. Regarding the sediment samples, 3/12 were positive by RT-qPCR, but only IP4 region was successfully amplificated. Quantification values for sediment samples ranged from <LoQ to 3.60 Log genomic copies/g of sediment. RNA signals disappeared in the PMAxx-triton viability RT-qPCR assay, indicating non-infectious potential. In addition, the recently discovered human-specific gut associated bacteriophage crAssphage was also quantified as a biomarker for the presence of human-derived wastewater contamination on the study area. CrAssphage was detected in 100% of both types of samples with quantification values ranging from <LoQ to 5.94 Log gc/g digestive tissue and from <LoQ to 4.71 Log gc/g sediment. Statistical analysis also showed that quantification levels for the crAssphage in clams are significantly higher than in sediments. These findings represent the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the marine environment, demonstrating that it can reach these habitats and make contact with the marine life.","Polo, David; Lois, Marta; Fernández-Núñez, María Teresa; Romalde, Jesús L",Sci Total Environ,90,15

This is a case report of acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN), presenting with low visual acuity in the left eye, 14 days after the first symptoms of COVID-19 infection. CASE REPORT A 71-year-old woman presented for ophthalmological evaluation complaining of low visual acuity in the left eye, 14 days after the first symptoms of COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 was confirmed by a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. The left eye examination showed visual acuity of 0.5 logMAR, fundoscopy showed foveal pigment mobilization, fluorescein angiography revealed a hypofluorescent fovea surrounded by irregular hyperfluorescent defects, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography showed central foveal thinning with disrupted interdigitation and ellipsoid zones. Given the clinical and imaging findings, the diagnosis of AMN was finalized. AMN usually resolves without specific treatment. CONCLUSIONS This case report shows that patients with COVID-19 can develop retinal involvement. AMN can be due to a viral infection, including COVID-19, and usually resolves without specific treatment. In the present case, there was no improvement in the patient's clinical condition in a 2-month follow-up to date.","Aidar, Mariana Nadais; Gomes, Thaís Mota; de Almeida, Márgara Zanotele Hemerly; de Andrade, Eric Pinheiro; Serracarbassa, Pedro Durães",Am J Case Rep,90,10

This exploratory study examined COVID-19 related peritraumatic distress among child welfare workers (N=1,996) in one southeastern state in the United States (U.S.). Findings suggest that the study sample was experiencing distress levels above normal ranges; 46.4% of participants were experiencing mild or severe distress. Sexual orientation, self-reported physical and mental health, relationship status, supervision status, and financial stability impacted distress levels experienced by child welfare workers. Overall, data suggest that COVID-19 is impacting child welfare workers and there is a need to conceptualize, implement, and evaluate initiatives aimed at assuaging distress among child welfare workers.","Jay Miller, J; Niu, Chunling; Moody, Shannon",Child Youth Serv Rev,90,26

COVID-19 can cause multiple organ dysfunction, such as respiratory and circulatory failure, liver and kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and thromboembolism, and even death. The World Health Organization reports that the mortality rate of severe-type COVID-19 is over 50%. Currently, the number of severe cases worldwide has increased rapidly, but the experience in the treatment of infected patients is still limited. Given the lack of specific antiviral drugs, multi-organ function support treatment is important for patients with COVID-19. To improve the cure rate and reduce the mortality of patients with severe- and critical-type COVID-19, this paper summarizes the experience of organ function support in patients with severe- and critical-type COVID-19 in Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. This paper systematically summarizes the procedures of functional support therapies for multiple organs and systems, including respiratory, circulatory, renal, hepatic, and hematological systems, among patients with severe- and critical-type COVID-19.

Design/methodology/approach: This study conducted a quantification study related to phenomena related to the success of post-COVID-19 food security policies. The data used are primary data with a research instrument in the form of a questionnaire. Data analysis using the measurement model Structural Equation Model (SEM). The population in this study was all people in the city of Bandung, Indonesia. Findings: The role of the Central Government (X1), the role of the Local Government (X2) and Public Participation (X3) is very important for improving Governance (Y1) and Food Defense Policy (Y2). Thus, the conditions of the role of the Central Government (X1), the role of the Local Government (X2) and Public Participation (X3) must always be maintained. Efforts to maintain the role of the Central Government (X1) and the role of the Local Government (X2) can be done by paying attention to the organizing aspect. This indicator is known to have a very important influence in reflecting the role of the Central Government (X1) and the role of the Local Government (X2). On the other hand, efforts to increase Public Participation (X3) can be done by paying attention to the Psychological indicators (X31). Originality/value: The government must take steps to prevent a food crisis. Apart from that, the government is also deemed necessary to map existing agricultural potentials, stabilize food prices, carry out consolidation related to agricultural land and also make regulations related to existing food problems. Apart from the role of the government, the public can also take part in maintaining food security to avoid a food crisis. Communities have the opportunity to build food sovereignty and self-sufficiency. During a pandemic like this, people tend to be more creative and can be creative to outsmart existing situations. This includes maintaining access to food. The community is expected to have the awareness to undertake at least independent planting to meet their own food needs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Amin, F.; Poespito Hadi, W.; Zauhar, S.; Santoso Haryono, B.",International Journal of Disaster Resilience in the Built Environment,90,16

Research in this topic has primarily concentrated on finding the seed configuration which infects the most individuals. Although these optimal configurations give insight into how the initial state affects the outcome of an epidemic, they are unlikely to occur in real life. In this paper we identify two important seeding scenarios, both motivated by historical data, that reveal a new complex phenomenon. In one scenario, the seeds are concentrated on the central nodes of a network, while in the second, they are spread uniformly in the population. Comparing the final size of the epidemic started from these two initial conditions through data-driven and synthetic simulations on real and modelled geometric metapopulation networks, we find evidence for a switchover phenomenon: When the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is close to its critical value, more individuals become infected in the first seeding scenario, but for larger values of $R_0$, the second scenario is more dangerous. We find that the switchover phenomenon is amplified by the geometric nature of the underlying network, and confirm our results via mathematically rigorous proofs, by mapping the network epidemic processes to bond percolation. Our results expand on the previous finding that in case of a single seed, the first scenario is always more dangerous, and further our understanding why the sizes of consecutive waves can differ even if their epidemic characters are similar.","'Odor, Gergely; Czifra, Domonkos; Komj'athy, J'ulia; Lov'asz, L'aszl'o; Karsai, M'arton",,90,5

This study assesses alcohol consumption and hazardous drinking behavior during the initial phase of pandemic measures in Norway and identifies potential risk factors. A cross-sectional study (N = 25,708) was conducted in Bergen, Norway, following the first six weeks of strict infection control measures. In a model of self-assessed increased alcohol consumption, logistic regression analysis was conducted with independent variables for COVID-19-related worries, joblessness, quarantine, self-reported drinking behavior, age, gender, and occupational situation. These are reported with odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals. Fifty-one percent of respondents reported economic or health-related worries due to COVID-19, 16% had been in quarantine, 49% worked/studied from home, 54% reported hazardous drinking behavior, and 13% reported increased alcohol consumption. People aged 30-39 years had elevated odds of increased alcohol consumption during lockdown (OR 3.1, 2.4-3.8) compared to the oldest adults.

Understanding how laypersons interpret the personal health information accessible to them via electronic patient records (EPRs) is crucial to healthcare planning and the design of services. Yet we still know little about how the format in which personal medical information is presented in the EPR (numerically, verbally, or graphically) affects individuals' understanding of the information, their assessment of its gravity, and the course of action they choose in response. METHODS: We employed an online questionnaire to assess respondents' reactions to 10 medical decision-making scenarios, where the same information was presented using different formats. In each scenario, respondents were presented with real (anonymized) patient lab results using either numeric expressions, graphs, or verbal expressions. Participants were asked to assess the gravity of the hypothetical patient's condition and the course of action they would follow if they were that patient. The questionnaire was distributed to more than 300 participants, of whom 225 submitted usable responses. RESULTS: Laypersons were more likely to overestimate the gravity of the information when it was presented either numerically or graphically compared to the narrative format. High perceived gravity was most likely to produce an inclination to actively seek medical attention, even when unwarranted. ""Don't know"" responses were most likely to produce an inclination to either search the Internet or wait for the doctor to call. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS: We discuss the study's implications for the effective design of lab results in the patient portals. We suggest (1) that graphs, tables, and charts would be easier to interpret if coupled with a brief verbal explanation; (2) that highlighting an overall level of urgency may be more helpful than indicating a diversion from the norm; and (3) that statements of results should include the type of follow-up required.","Bar-Lev, Shirly; Beimel, Dizza",Isr J Health Policy Res,90,13

These policies function by reducing the rate of close contact within populations and result in decreased human mobility. Adherence to social distancing can substantially reduce disease spread. Thus, quantifying human mobility and social-distancing compliance, especially at high temporal resolution, can provide great insight into the impact of social distancing policies. METHODS: We used the movement of individuals around New York City (NYC), measured via traffic levels, as a proxy for human mobility and the impact of social-distancing policies (i.e., work from home policies, school closure, indoor dining closure etc.). By data mining Google traffic in real-time, and applying image processing, we derived high resolution time series of traffic in NYC. We used time series decomposition and generalized additive models to quantify changes in rush hour/non-rush hour, and weekday/weekend traffic, pre-pandemic and following the roll-out of multiple social distancing interventions. RESULTS: Mobility decreased sharply on March 14, 2020 following declaration of the pandemic. However, levels began rebounding by approximately April 13, almost 2 months before stay-at-home orders were lifted, indicating premature increase in mobility, which we term social-distancing fatigue. We also observed large impacts on diurnal traffic congestion, such that the pre-pandemic bi-modal weekday congestion representing morning and evening rush hour was dramatically altered. By September, traffic congestion rebounded to approximately 75% of pre-pandemic levels. CONCLUSION: Using crowd-sourced traffic congestion data, we described changes in mobility in Manhattan, NYC, during the COVID-19 pandemic. These data can be used to inform human mobility changes during the current pandemic, in planning for responses to future pandemics, and in understanding the potential impact of large-scale traffic interventions such as congestion pricing policies.","Shearston, Jenni A; Martinez, Micaela E; Nunez, Yanelli; Hilpert, Markus",Sci Total Environ,90,16

A large part of this variation may be due to the ages of individuals who are tested and identified. OBJECTIVE: To measure the contribution of distortions from the age distributions of confirmed cases to CFRs within and across populations. DESIGN: Cross-sectional demographic study using aggregate data on COVID-19 cases and deaths by age. SETTING: Population-based data from China, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. PARTICIPANTS: All individuals with confirmed COVID-19, as reported by each country as of 19 April 2020 (n = 1 223 261). MEASUREMENTS: Age-specific COVID-19 CFRs and age-specific population shares by country. RESULTS: The overall observed CFR varies widely, with the highest rates in Italy (9.3%) and the Netherlands (7.4%) and the lowest rates in South Korea (1.6%) and Germany (0.7%). Adjustment for the age distribution of cases explains 66% of the variation across countries, with a resulting age-standardized median CFR of 1.9%. Among a larger sample of 95 countries, the observed variation in COVID-19 CFRs is 13 times larger than what would be expected on the basis of just differences in the age composition of countries. LIMITATION: The age-adjusted rates assume that, conditional on age, COVID-19 mortality among diagnosed cases is the same as that among undiagnosed cases and that individuals of all ages are equally susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. CONCLUSION: Selective testing and identification of older cases considerably warps estimates of the lethality of COVID-19 within populations and comparisons across countries. Removing age distortions and focusing on differences in age-adjusted case fatality will be essential for accurately comparing countries' performance in caring for patients with COVID-19 and for monitoring the epidemic over time.

This lockdown affected significantly the atmospheric pollution levels due to the restrictions of human activities. In the present study, we investigate the evolution of air quality in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, focusing on nine atmospheric pollutants (NO2, NO, PM10, PM2.5, O3, VOC, CO, SO2, and isoprene). In Lyon, center of the region, the results indicated that NO2, NO, and CO levels were reduced by 67%, 78%, and 62%, respectively, resulting in a decrease in road traffic by 80%. However, O3, PM10, and PM2.5 were increased by 105%, 23%, and 53%, respectively, during the lockdown. The increase in ozone is explained by the dropping in NO and other gases linked to human activity, which consume ozone. Thus, the increase of solar radiation, sunshine, temperature, and humidity promoted the O3 formation during the lockdown. Besides, rising temperature enhances the BVOC emissions such as isoprene. In addition, volatile organic component (VOC) and SO2 remain almost stable and oxidation of these species leads to the formation of ozone and organic aerosol, which also explains the increase in PM during the lockdown. This study shows the contribution of atmospheric photochemistry to air pollution.

CIPA is caused by mutations in the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 gene (NTRK1) that encodes the high-affinity receptor of nerve growth factor (NGF). CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we present clinical and molecular findings in a 9-year-old girl with CIPA. The high-altitude indigenous Ecuadorian patient presented several health problems such as anhidrosis, bone fractures, self-mutilation, osteochondroma, intellectual disability and Riga-Fede disease. After the mutational analysis of NTRK1, the patient showed a clearly autosomal recessive inheritance pattern with the pathogenic mutation rs763758904 (Arg602*) and the second missense mutation rs80356677 (Asp674Tyr). Additionally, the genomic analysis showed 69 pathogenic and/or likely pathogenic variants in 46 genes possibly related to phenotypic heterogeneity, including the rs324420 variant in the FAAH gene. The gene ontology enrichment analysis showed 28 mutated genes involved in several biological processes. As a novel contribution, the protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that NTRK1, SPTBN2 and GRM6 interact with several proteins of the pain matrix involved in the response to stimulus and nervous system development.

In humans, almost every type of inflammation is accompanied by an increase of CRP concentration. Until recently, the only known physiological function of CRP was the marking of cells to initiate their phagocytosis. This triggers the classical complement pathway up to C4, which helps to eliminate pathogens and dead cells.

Recently, it was shown that CRP can have a direct effect on blood pressure in rabbits. This is interesting in regard to patients with high inflammation, as they often become tachycardic and need catecholamines. These two physiological effects of CRP apparently also occur in COVID-19. Parts of the lung become ischemic due to intra-alveolar edema and hemorrhage and in parallel CRP increases dramatically, hence it is assumed that CRP is also involved in this ischemic condition. It is meanwhile considered that most of the damage in COVID-19 is caused by the immune system. The high amounts of CRP could have an additional influence on blood pressure in severe COVID-19.","Sheriff, Ahmed; Kayser, Stefan; Brunner, Patrizia; Vogt, Birgit",Front Immunol,90,21

METHODS: Our data were from network-based survey, and 17,876 participants completed the questionnaire. t test, one-way ANOVA and multiple linear regression model were performed using PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) score as the dependent variable. RESULTS: Of 17,876 participants, the mean score of PA was 25.5 ± 7.3, while NA was 19.1 ± 7.1. Multiple linear regression models showed that there are some common determinants of PA and NA, such as education, health literacy on communicable diseases, satisfaction with measures for epidemic prevention and control, risk of infection, impact of the outbreak on daily life, sleep duration and frequency of hand washing in the past 2 weeks. Besides, whether the student is a medical major and whether outing in the past 2 weeks were specific determinants of PA, and frequency of masks wearing was specific determinant of NA. CONCLUSIONS: The outbreak of COVID-19 is detrimental to university and college students' affect. During the outbreak response, we should strengthen the guidance and regulation for negative affect and pay attention to improving the positive affect of university and college students.","Wang, Yali; Jing, Xiang; Han, Wantong; Jing, Yurong; Xu, Lingzhong",Int J Public Health,90,1

We aimed to investigate the frequency and the impact on clinical outcome of PE elevation and acute pancreatitis in such patients. METHODS: Clinical data, laboratory tests, and cross-sectional images were analyzed from COVID-19 patients admitted to the Tor Vergata Hospital in Rome. Variables associated with PE abnormalities, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death were investigated through univariate and multivariate analyses and Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Pancreatic enzymes were available in 254 of 282 COVID-19 patients. Among these, 66 patients (26%) showed mild elevation of PE, and 11 patients (4.3%) had severe elevation (>3 times of the upper limit of normal). Overall, 2 patients met the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis. Hepatic and renal involvements were associated with PE elevation. Multivariate analysis showed that mild and severe PE elevations were significantly associated with ICU admission (odds ratios, 5.51 [95% confidence interval, 2.36-12.89; P < 0.0001] and 26.2 [95% confidence interval, 4.82-142.39; P < 0.0001]).

Nasopharyngeal swabs from 453 adult SARS-CoV-2-infected patients from the Department of Infectious Diseases, Besançon, France, were collected at the time of admission or consultation for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Clinical information and concentrations of biological parameters (C-reactive protein [CRP], fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], prealbumin) were noticed. Mean respiratory VL homogeneously decreased from 7.2 log10 copies/ml (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.6-7.8) on the first day of symptoms until 4.6 log10 copies/ml (95% CI: 3.8-5.4) at day 10 (slope = -0.24; R2 = .95). VL were poorly correlated with COVID-19 symptoms and outcome, excepted for dyspnea and anosmia, which were significantly associated with lower VL (p < .05). CRP, fibrinogen, and LDH concentrations significantly increased over the first 10 days (median CRP concentrations from 36.8 mg/L at days 0-1 to 99.5 mg/L at days 8-10; p < .01), whereas prealbumin concentrations tended to decrease. Since SARS-CoV-2 respiratory VL regularly decrease in the acute phase of infection, determining the level of VL may help predicting the onset of virus shedding in a specific patient. However, the role of SARS-CoV-2 VL as a biomarker of severity is limited.","Biguenet, Adrien; Bouiller, Kevin; Marty-Quinternet, Solène; Brunel, Anne-Sophie; Chirouze, Catherine; Lepiller, Quentin",J. med. virol,90,24

Controversial claims have been made in the literature regarding whether the viral load distribution actually depends on the age of the patients. Such a dependence would have implications for the COVID-19 spreading mechanism, the age-dependent immune system reaction, and thus for policymaking. We hereby develop a method to analyze viral-load distribution data as a function of the patients' age within a flexible, non-parametric, hierarchical, Bayesian, and causal model. This method can be applied to other contexts as well, and for this purpose, it is made freely available. The developed reconstruction method also allows testing for bias in the data. This could be due to, e.g., bias in patient-testing and data collection or systematic errors in the measurement of the viral load. We perform these tests by calculating the Bayesian evidence for each implied possible causal direction. When applying these tests to publicly available age and SARS-CoV-2 viral load data, we find a statistically significant increase in the viral load with age, but only for one of the two analyzed datasets. If we consider this dataset, and based on the current understanding of viral load's impact on patients' infectivity, we expect a non-negligible difference in the infectivity of different age groups. This difference is nonetheless too small to justify considering any age group as noninfectious.","Guardiani, Matteo; Frank, Philipp; Kosti'c, Andrija; Edenhofer, Gordian; Roth, Jakob; Uhlmann, Berit; Ensslin, Torsten",,90,14

Various types of bacterial and fungal infections occur in patients with COVID-19 with some resistant to antimicrobials that are associated with significantly worse outcomes and deaths. Besides, antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) co-infections are responsible for clinically significant mortality in past pandemics. There is evidence to suggest that factors such as the proliferation of adulterated antimicrobials in some developing countries, international travels, issues with healthcare financing, use/misuse by humans, and in agricultural production and climate change are determinants of AMR at various levels of society. These complex interrelated determinants intersect with AMR in current and past pandemics and could amplify the potential of a future antimicrobial resistance pandemic. Therefore, global concerted interventions targeted at all levels of society to reduce the use/misuse of antimicrobials and disrupt these multifaceted, interrelated, and interdependent factors are urgently needed. This paper leverages prior research to describe complex major determinants of antimicrobial resistance and provides fresh insights into possible intervention strategies to tackle antimicrobial resistance including in the current and future pandemics.","Ukuhor, Hyacinth O",J Infect Public Health,90,16

Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (rRT-PCR) can detect SARS-COV-2 by targeting open reading frame-1 antibodies (ORF1ab), envelope protein, nucleocapsid protein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes, and the N1, N2, and N3 (3N) target genes. Therefore, rRT-PCR remains the primary method of diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 despite being limited by false-negative results, long turnaround, complex protocols, and a need for skilled personnel. Serological diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is simple and does not require complex techniques and equipment, rendering it suitable for rapid detection and massive screening. However, serological tests cannot confirm SARS-CoV-2, and results will be false negative when antibody concentrations fall below detection limits. Balancing the increased use of laboratory tests, risk of testing errors, need for tests, burden on healthcare systems, benefits of early diagnosis, and risk of unnecessary exposure is a significant and persistent challenge in diagnosing COVID-19.

Shelter in place regulations that have extended across the globe may influence condomless sex, exacerbate intimate partner violence and reduce access to essential reproductive health services. Population representative research is challenging during shelter in place, leaving major gaps in our understanding of sexual and reproductive health during COVID-19. This International Sexual Health And ReproductivE health (I-SHARE) study protocol manuscript describes a common plan for online national surveys and global comparative analyses. METHODS: The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to better understand sexual and reproductive health in selected countries during the COVID-19 pandemic and facilitate multinational comparisons. Participants will be recruited through an online survey link disseminated through local, regional and national networks. In each country, a lead organisation will be responsible for organising ethical review, translation and survey administration. The consortium network provides support for national studies, coordination and multinational comparison. We will use multilevel modelling to determine the relationship between COVID-19 and condomless sex, intimate partner violence, access to reproductive health services, HIV testing and other key items. This study protocol defines primary outcomes, prespecified subanalyses and analysis plans. CONCLUSION: The I-SHARE study examines sexual and reproductive health at the national and global level during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will use multilevel modelling to investigate country-level variables associated with outcomes of interest. This will provide a foundation for subsequent online multicountry comparison using more robust sampling methodologies.","Michielsen, Kristien; Larrson, Elin C; Kågesten, Anna; Erausquin, Jennifer Toller; Griffin, Sally; Van de Velde, Sarah; Tucker, Joseph D",Sex. transm. infect,90,14

OBJECTIVE: The objective with this review is to determine if FCRs promote the core values of humanism in medicine by answering the question, ""Do FCRs promote humanistic pediatric care?"" DATA SOURCES: Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a search of PubMed, Web of Science, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Dissertation Abstracts for peer-reviewed pediatric studies through January 1, 2020. We used search terms including FCRs, communication, humanism, and the specific descriptors in the Gold Foundation's definition of humanism. STUDY SELECTION: Abstracts (n = 1003) were assessed for 5 primary outcomes: empathy, enhanced communication, partnership, respect, and satisfaction and service. We evaluated 158 full-text articles for inclusion, reconciling discrepancies through an iterative process. DATA EXTRACTION: Data abstraction, thematic analysis, and conceptual synthesis were conducted on 29 studies. RESULTS: Pediatric family-centered rounds (FCRs) improved humanistic outcomes within all 5 identified themes. Not all studies revealed improvement within every category. The humanistic benefits of FCRs are enhanced through interventions targeted toward provider-family barriers, such as health literacy. Patients with limited English proficiency or disabilities or who were receiving intensive care gained additional benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric FCRs promote humanistic outcomes including increased empathy, partnership, respect, service, and communication. Limitations included difficulty in defining humanism, variable implementation, and inconsistent reporting of humanistic outcomes. Future efforts should include highlighting FCR's humanistic benefits, universal implementation, and adapting FCRs to pandemics such as coronavirus disease 2019.","Fernandes, Ashley K; Wilson, Sheria; Nalin, Ansel P; Philip, Andrew; Gruber, Laura; Kwizera, Elise; Sydelko, Bette S; Forbis, Shalini G; Lauden, Stephanie",Hosp Pediatr,90,26

To overcome the cost and transgene capacity limitations of traditional viral vectors, CAR T-cells were produced using the piggyBac transposon system of genetic modification. Following CAR T-cell infusion, one patient developed a gradually enlarging retroperitoneal tumor due to a CAR expressing CD4+ T-cell lymphoma. Screening of other patients led to the detection of a second CAR T-cell tumor in thoracic para-aortic lymph nodes in an asymptomatic patient. Analysis of the first lymphoma showed a high transgene copy number, but no insertion into typical oncogenes. There were also structural changes such as altered genomic copy number and point mutations unrelated to the insertion sites. Transcriptome analysis showed transgene promoter driven upregulation of transcription of surrounding regions despite insulator sequences surrounding the transgene. However, marked global changes in transcription predominantly correlated with gene copy number rather than insertion sites. In both patients, the CAR T-cell derived lymphoma progressed and one patient died. We describe the first two cases of malignant lymphoma derived from CAR gene modified T-cells.

The increasing global health and economic burden of SARS-CoV-2 has necessitated urgent investigations into the pathogenesis of disease and development of therapeutic and vaccination regimens. Human trials of vaccine and antiviral candidates have been undertaken, but basic pathogenetic studies are still required to inform these trials. Gaps in understanding of cellular infection by, and immunity to, SARS-CoV-2 mean additional models are required to assist in improved design of these therapeutics. Human organoids are three-dimensional models that contain multiple cell types and mimic human organs in ex vivo culture conditions. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been implicated in causing not only respiratory injury but also injury to other organs such as the brain, liver and kidneys. Consequently, a variety of different organoid models have been employed to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms of disease due to SARS-CoV-2. Data on these models have not been systematically assembled. In this review, we highlight key findings from studies that have utilised different human organoid types to investigate the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors, permissiveness, immune response, dysregulation of cellular functions, and potential antiviral therapeutics.","Egilmezer, Ece; Rawlinson, William D",Rev. med. virol,90,1

METHODS OF STUDY: A total of 166 women with singleton pregnancies complicated by PPROM were included. Amniocentesis was performed at the time of admission and assessments of MIAC (using both cultivation and non-cultivation techniques) and IAI (interleukin-6 in amniotic fluid) were performed on all subjects. Based on the presence/absence of MIAC and IAI, the women were further divided into the following subgroups: intra-amniotic infection, sterile IAI, colonization, and absence of both MIAC and IAI. Amniotic fluid granzyme A levels were assessed using ELISA. RESULTS: Women with MIAC had lower levels of granzyme A in the amniotic fluid than women without this condition (with MIAC: median 15.9 pg/mL vs. without MIAC: median 19.9 pg/mL, p = .03). Women with sterile IAI had higher amniotic fluid granzyme A levels than women with intra-amniotic infection, colonization and women with the absence of either MIAC or IAI (intra-amniotic infection: median 15.6 pg/mL; sterile IAI: median 31.8 pg/mL; colonization: median 16.9 pg/mL; absence of both MIAC and IAI: median 18.8 pg/mL; p = .02).

Healthcare workers that are in the front line face challenges with a shortage of personal protective equipment, high risk of contamination, low adherence to the social distancing measures by the population, low coronavirus testing with underestimation of cases, and also financial concerns due to the economic crisis in a developing country. This study compared the impact of COVID-19 pandemic among three categories of healthcare workers in Brazil: physicians, nurses, and dentists, about workload, income, protection, training, feelings, behavior, and level of concern and anxiety. The sample was randomly selected and a Google Forms questionnaire was sent by WhatsApp messenger. The survey comprised questions about jobs, income, workload, PPE, training for COVID-19 patient care, behavior and feelings during the pandemic. The number of jobs reduced for all healthcare workers in Brazil during the pandemic, but significantly more for dentists. The workload and income reduced to all healthcare workers. Most healthcare workers did not receive proper training for treating COVID-19 infected patients. Physicians and nurses were feeling more tired than usual. Most of the healthcare workers in all groups reported difficulties in sleeping during the pandemic.

We conducted a survey in April 2020 of 140 UK experts and 2,086 UK laypersons; all were asked to make four quantitative predictions about the impact of COVID-19 by 31 Dec 2020. In addition to soliciting point estimates, we asked participants for lower and higher bounds of a range that they felt had a 75% chance of containing the true answer. Experts exhibited greater accuracy and calibration than laypersons, even when restricting the comparison to a subset of laypersons who scored in the top quartile on a numeracy test. Even so, experts substantially underestimated the ultimate extent of the pandemic, and the mean number of predictions for which the expert intervals contained the actual outcome was only 1.8 (out of 4), suggesting that experts should consider broadening the range of scenarios they consider plausible.

PTSI are also linked to increased absenteeism, suicidality, and performance decrements, which compromise occupational and public health and safety in trauma-exposed workers. Evidence is lacking regarding the effectiveness of ""prevention"" programs designed to mitigate PTSI proactively. The purpose of this review is to measure the effectiveness of proactive PTSI mitigation programs among occupational groups exposed to PPTE on measures of PTSI symptoms, absenteeism, and psychological wellness. METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched per PRISMA guidelines for English or French peer-reviewed studies from 2008 to 2019 evaluating PTSI and psychological wellness in adults exposed to occupational PPTE. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: We identified 42 studies evaluating 3182 public safety and frontline healthcare professionals, PPTE-exposed educational staff, and miners. Significant overlap was found across program themes that included mindfulness, psychoeducation, resilience promotion, and stress management strategies. Post-program effect sizes were small (SMD < 0.5) to moderate (SMD < 0.8) for reductions in PTSI symptoms and for promoting measures of well-being as indicated by a meta-analysis on 36 studies. There was no evidence for significant reductions in substance use, absenteeism, or biomarkers of distress except for heart rate. Subgroup analyses indicated that multimodal programs effectively improved general psychological health, while resilience programs improved measures of depression, burnout, coping, and resilience. Effect sizes for resilience, depression, and general psychological health improvements were greatest immediately or 1-month post-training, while improvements in PTSD symptoms and coping were larger at longer follow-up. Studies were of moderate quality and risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: The current results showcase modest evidence for time-limited reductions in PTSI following participation in holistic programs that promote resilience, stress, and emotion regulation among at-risk workers. Implications for organizational implementation of proactive PTSI mitigation programs and areas of future research are discussed.

The current research analyzed the COVID-19 infection control practices in a regional mental health center in China and addressed how this type of medical institutions could enhance their ability to prevent and control hospital transmission of major respiratory diseases and general management of nosocomial infection risks. Firstly, hospital-related risks of COVID-19 were analyzed, and targeted prevention and control measures were then established. Pre- and post-intervention theoretical knowledge of nosocomial infection control, hand hygiene compliance and accuracy, use of personal protective equipment, and disinfection and sterilization effectiveness were evaluated and compared. All the indexes displayed significant improvements following the implementation of the prevention and control measures. Up to the submission of this paper, the mental health center had obtained no suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 infection due to hospital transmission. The findings provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of the COVID-19 preventive strategies and have important implications for integrated and characterized infection control in mental health centers during a major epidemic. The establishment of the transitional isolation ward and air fumigation using traditional Chinese medicine for patients and staff are preventive measures worthy of further discussion and dissemination.","Yang, Mi; Wang, Hongming; Li, Zhi; Zhang, Qiang; Liu, Xin; He, Manxi; Gao, Shan",Front.

Museums, libraries, archives, and other cultural institutions have been closed in lockdowns all around the European Union, and their content presented and consumed online. This paper will analyse how copyright rules affect cultural heritage institutions (publicly accessible libraries or museums, archives or film or audio heritage institutions) in the digital age. Four recent legal documents at the European level refer to the digitalisation of their collections and the digitised content's exposure to the public in the Digital Single Market. These are Directive 2001/29/EC, Directive 2012/28/EU, Directive (EU) 2019/790 and Directive (EU) 2019/1024. This paper willfirst analyse how exclusive rights are regulated for authors, other creators, publishers, and producers in the digital age. Those rights need to be respected and exercised effectively by their owners. On the other hand, there is also a public interest, in that digitisation and access to digitised content should be free in cultural heritage institutions. To resolve the tension inherent in this relationship is not easy. The recent rapid change in consumption of creative, cultural and artistic content in the Single Digital Market (due to the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus) has triggered the need for swifter digitisation of cultural heritage institutions' collections. The European legal framework offers some solutions to this need, which will be presented here. It does not resolve the situation generally, but refers to particular issues, such as orphan works, out-of-commerce works, text and data mining and the re-use of public sector information. In general, copyright protection prevails. Nevertheless, the tendencies towards free access grow stronger every day. This paper will analyse how these four directives interact with each other in the effort to resolve the tension between copyright, digitisation and free access to digitised content in cultural heritage institutions. At the end, two ideas for a new balance are presented.","Vučković, Romana Matanovac Kanceljak Ivana PhD Assistant Professor Jurić Marko PhD Assistant Professor",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,90,16

Data were obtained from the national COVID-19 Data Hub, the National Health Protection Surveillance Centre, the National Contact Management Programme and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. RESULTS: A total of 25 617 cases were notified during the study period. Weekly cases and deaths peaked in mid-April 2020 at 5701 and 316, respectively. Mean number of close contacts per case was lowest at 0.7 in April, rising to 6.6 by July. Outbreak settings shifted from travel and workplace in March, to healthcare in April. Restrictions implemented on 12 March extended to full lockdown on 27 March. Phased relaxation of restrictions commenced 18 May. Effective suppression of community transmission of COVID-19 was achieved by June 2020. CONCLUSION: Lockdown is a crude population-level restriction effective in controlling COVID-19. Phased relaxation of restrictions in Ireland, however, led to an immediate increase in mean number of contacts per case, which facilitates viral transmission unless individual-level restrictions are adhered to. This demonstrates a limitation of lockdown as a long-term mechanism of pandemic control.","Conway, Robert; Kelly, David M; Mullane, Paul; Ni Bhuachalla, Cliodhna; O039,; Connor, Lois; Buckley, Claire; Kearney, Patricia M; Doyle, Sarah",J. public health (Oxf),90,8

The dynamics of vascular damage, and whether it is a direct consequence of endothelial infection or an indirect consequence of an immune cell-mediated cytokine storm remain unknown. Using a vascularized lung-on-chip model, we find that infection of alveolar epithelial cells leads to limited apical release of virions, consistent with reports of monoculture infection. However, viral RNA and proteins are rapidly detected in underlying endothelial cells, which are themselves refractory to apical infection in monocultures. Although endothelial infection is unproductive, it leads to the formation of cell clusters with low CD31 expression, a progressive loss of barrier integrity and a pro-coagulatory microenvironment. Viral RNA persists in individual cells generating an inflammatory response, which is transient in epithelial cells but persistent in endothelial cells and typified by IL-6 secretion even in the absence of immune cells. Inhibition of IL-6 signalling with tocilizumab reduces but does not prevent loss of barrier integrity. SARS-CoV-2-mediated endothelial cell damage thus occurs independently of cytokine storm.","Thacker, Vivek V; Sharma, Kunal; Dhar, Neeraj; Mancini, Gian-Filippo; Sordet-Dessimoz, Jessica; McKinney, John D",EMBO Rep,90,0

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the medical costs associated with bronchiolitis hospitalizations caused by RSV infection among infants aged < 2 years in Colombia. METHODS: This was a prevalence-based cost-of-illness multicentric study performed from the societal perspective during 2016-2017. A case was defined as a laboratory-confirmed RSV infection with hospitalization. All costs and use of resources were collected directly from medical invoices and health records. RESULTS: This study included 193 patients with a diagnosis of RSV. The average hospital stay duration was 5.55 days. The major contributors to hospitalization costs were room costs (31.5%), drugs (21.8%), and indirect costs (14.9%). Medications with the highest costs were nebulization with a hypertonic solution and systemic antibiotics. In total, 96% of ß-lactam antibiotics, 90% of bronchodilators, and 86% of corticosteroids and epinephrine were classified as inappropriate. CONCLUSION: RSV infection in Colombia places a high economic burden on the health system. Generating comprehensive data on healthcare resource use and costs associated with RSV will help to provide valuable information for the development of cost-effectiveness models and to guide RSV-prevention strategies.","Buendía, Jefferson Antonio; Patiño, Diana Guerrero",,90,29

Clinical and experimental data have revealed a role for neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in COVID-19 disease. The mechanisms that drive thrombo-inflammation in COVID-19 are poorly understood. METHODS: We performed proteomic analysis and immunostaining of postmortem lung tissues from COVID-19 patients and patients with other lung pathologies. We further compared coagulation factor XII (FXII) and DNase activities in plasma samples from COVID-19 patients and healthy control donors and determined NET-induced FXII activation using a chromogenic substrate assay. FINDINGS: FXII expression and activity were increased in the lung parenchyma, within the pulmonary vasculature and in fibrin-rich alveolar spaces of postmortem lung tissues from COVID-19 patients. In agreement with this, plasmaaac acafajföeFXII activation (FXIIa) was increased in samples from COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, FXIIa colocalized with NETs in COVID-19 lung tissue indicating that NETs accumulation leads to FXII contact activation in COVID-19. We further showed that an accumulation of NETs is partially due to impaired NET clearance by extracellular DNases as DNase substitution improved NET dissolution and reduced FXII activation in vitro. INTERPRETATION: Collectively, our study supports that the NET/FXII axis contributes to the pathogenic chain of procoagulant and proinflammatory responses in COVID-19. Targeting both NETs and FXIIa may offer a potential novel therapeutic strategy.

This article will discuss how machine learning classification can be used to characterize the initial impairment and subsequent recovery of electromyography signals in an non-human primate model of traumatic spinal cord injury. The ultimate objective is to identify potential treatments for traumatic spinal cord injury. This work focuses specifically on finding a suitable classifier that differentiates between two distinct experimental stages (pre-and post-lesion) using electromyography signals. Eight time-domain features were extracted from the collected electromyography data. To overcome the imbalanced dataset issue, synthetic minority oversampling technique was applied. Different ML classification techniques were applied including multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbors, and radial basis function network; then their performances were compared. A confusion matrix and five other statistical metrics (sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, and F-measure) were used to evaluate the performance of the generated classifiers. The results showed that the best classifier for the left- and right-side data is the multilayer perceptron with a total F-measure of 79.5% and 86.0% for the left and right sides, respectively. This work will help to build a reliable classifier that can differentiate between these two phases by utilizing some extracted time-domain electromyography features.","Masood, Farah; Farzana, Maisha; Nesathurai, Shanker; Abdullah, Hussein A",Proc Inst Mech Eng H,90,23

Home confinement during COVID-19 made this less feasible. Our objective was to ascertain whether a transition to virtual online meetings among TS members took place, and whether it was potentially effective. METHODS: Two thousand one hundred fifty-two long-standing USA members of Narcotics Anonymous (NA) were surveyed to ascertain their recovery-related experiences and their relation to the transition to virtual meetings. RESULTS: During the previous week (ie, 'during COVID-19') respondents attended more virtual meetings (â=â4.13[SD4.64]) than they had attended both face-to-face meetings before COVID-19 (â=â3.35[SD2.05]), and also face-to-face meetings during COVID-19 (â=â0.75[SD1.8]). Many of the meetings were accessed from sites remote from their homes (44.4%), even overseas (21.5%). The majority (64.9%) found virtual meetings at least as effective in promoting their abstinence as were face-to-face meetings, and 41.8% estimated the same for newcomers. A shorter period of antecedent abstinence from drugs and increased loneliness were associated with increased craving during the transition period. Relative to Whites, Black respondents were less distressed, with a lesser increase in craving, and currently attended more virtual meetings. Data provided by a national program reflected a large increase in virtual TS attendance since the onset of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: In a survey of well-established NA members, most had made a successful transition from face-to-face to virtual meetings, relative to their antecedent characteristics. This successful transition suggests the possibility of an enhanced opportunity for stabilizing TS membership.","Galanter, Marc; White, William L; Hunter, Brooke",Journal of addiction medicine (Online),90,1

There are data suggesting the role of excessive immune activation and cytokine storm as the cause of lung injury in COVID-19. The excessive immune activation and cytokine storm usually occurs due to an imbalance in redox homeostasis of the individuals. Considering the antioxidant and free radical scavenging action of N acetyl cysteine (NAC), its use might be useful in COVID-19 patients by decreasing the cytokine storm consequently decreasing the disease severity. Therefore, we reviewed all the available resources pertaining to the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cytokine storm and the mechanism of action of NAC in preventing ROS.

However, most studies only have focused on clinical data. Evidence Acquisition: In this short review, the psychological effects of COVID-19 and its association with anxiety were examined. Accordingly, the electronic databases, including PubMed, Medline, Elsevier, and Science Direct were reviewed for relevant studies that have conducted since 2007. Results: The current study was carried out to indicate that COVID-19 has negative psychological problems other than mortality. A review of the studies performed in other parts of the world showed that COVID-19 has caused several psychological impacts, including increased anxiety. Conclusions: By an increase in the prevalence rate of COVID-19 and its resulted restrictions, the level of anxiety increases, as well; therefore, raising public awareness of the disease and providing positive psychological programs in the media aimed at controlling stress can reduce anxiety in society.","Fardin, Mohammad Ali",Arch.

METHODOLOGY: Analytical cohort study of patients with cancer and COVID-19 infection in Colombia. From April 1 to October 31, 2020. Demographic and clinical variables related to cancer and COVID-19 infection were collected. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality from all causes. The association between the outcome and the prognostic variables was analyzed using logistic regression models and survival analysis with Cox regression. RESULTS: The study included 742 patients; 72% were >51 years. The most prevalent neoplasms were breast (132, 17.77%), colorectal (92, 12.34%), and prostate (81, 10.9%). Two hundred twenty (29.6%) patients were asymptomatic and 96 (26.3%) died. In the bivariate descriptive analysis, higher mortality occurred in patients who were >70 years, patients with lung cancer, &#8805;2 comorbidities, former smokers, receiving antibiotics, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants, residents of rural areas, low socioeconomic status, and increased acute-phase reactants. In the logistic regression analysis, higher mortality was associated with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 3 (odds ratio [OR] 28.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.2-99.6); ECOG PS 4 (OR 20.89; 95% CI, 3.36-129.7); two complications from COVID-19 (OR 5.3; 95% CI, 1.50-18.1); and cancer in progression (OR 2.08; 95% CI, 1.01-4.27). In the Cox regression analysis, the statistically significant hazard ratios (HR) were metastatic disease (HR 1.58; 95% CI, 1.16-2.16), cancer in progression (HR 1.08; 95% CI, 1.24-2.61) cancer in partial response (HR 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11-0.88), use of steroids (HR 1.44; 95% CI, 1.01-2.06), and use of antibiotics (HR 2.11; 95% CI, 1.47-2.95). CONCLUSION: In our study, patients with cancer have higher mortality due to COVID-19 infection if they have active cancer, metastatic or progressive cancer, ECOG PS >2, and low socioeconomic status. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study's findings raise the need to carefully evaluate patients with metastatic cancer, in progression, and with impaired Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status to define the relevance of cancer treatment during the pandemic, consider the risk/benefit of the interventions, and establish clear and complete communication with the patients and their families about the risk of complications. There is also the importance of offering additional support to patients with low income and residence in rural areas so that they can have more support during cancer treatment.","Ospina, Aylen Vanessa; Bruges, Ricardo; Mantilla, William; Triana, Iván; Ramos, Pedro; Aruachan, Sandra; Quiroga, Alicia; Munevar, Isabel; Ortiz, Juan; Llinás, Néstor; Pinilla, Paola; Vargas, Henry; Idrobo, Henry; Russi, Andrea; Kopp, Ray Manneh; Rivas, Giovanna; González, Héctor; Santa, Daniel; Insuasty, Jesús; Bernal, Laura; Otero, Jorge; Vargas, Carlos; Pacheco, Javier; Alcalá, Carmen; Jiménez, Paola; Lombana, Milton; Contreras, Fernando; Segovia, Javier; Pino, Luis; Lobatón, José; González, Manuel; Cuello, Javier; Bogoya, Juliana; Barrero, Angela; de Lima Lopes, Gilberto",Oncologist,90,30

However, the mechanism of such correlations requires an in-depth understanding. Overnutrition/excess serum amino acid profile during obesity has been linked with inflammation and reprogramming of translational machinery through hyperactivation of amino acid sensor mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is exploited by SARS-CoV-2 for its replication. Conversely, we have shown that the activation of general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2)-dependent amino acid starvation sensing pathway suppresses intestinal inflammation by inhibiting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1ß). While activation of GCN2 has shown to mitigate susceptibility to dengue infection, GCN2 deficiency increases viremia and inflammation-associated pathologies. These findings reveal that the amino acid sensing pathway plays a significant role in controlling inflammation and viral infections. The current fact is that obesity/excess amino acids/mTOR activation aggravates COVID-19, and it might be possible that activation of amino acid starvation sensor GCN2 has an opposite effect. This article focuses on the amino acid sensing pathways through which host cells sense the availability of amino acids and reprogram the host translation machinery to mount an effective antiviral response. Besides, how SARS-CoV-2 hijack and exploit amino acid sensing pathway for its replication and pathogenesis is also discussed.","Philips, Aradhana Mariam; Khan, Nooruddin",Obes Rev,90,1

They are simple and low-cost, enabling technology that provides adequate water sources, handwashing stations and motivation for people to prioritise handwashing. This systematic review aimed to establish the use, benefits, adoption and effectiveness of enabling technology; tippy-tap handwashing station, in resource-limited settings. METHODS: We systematically searched for articles in the PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED, CINAHL, DOAJ and Google Scholar databases guided by the acceptable best practice developed by the PROSPERO and COCHRANE for systematic search and selection of articles. Search terms such as tippy-taps, enabling technology, hand-washing station, hand-washing behaviour, diarrhoea, respiratory infection, increase handwashing behaviour were used. In addition, a PRISMA flow diagram was used to elaborate on the number of articles retrieved, retained, excluded and reasons for every action. Studies that used tippy-tap hand washing station as a handwashing facility regardless of the design were included in this review. A mixed method appraisal tool was used to appraise studies. RESULTS: Twenty articles met the eligibility criteria. The use of tippy-taps for handwashing by household members or school children was reported by authors of 16 studies, and it ranged from 2.7 to 80%. The availability of tippy-taps increased handwashing and use of soap among participants. Furthermore, the majority of people who were oriented to tippy-taps or recruited to tippy-tap studies built their tippy-tap stations even after the promotional activities or programs had ended. In one study, tippy-taps were reported by participant to be effective in preventing episodes of stomach pain among participants. CONCLUSION: Tippy-tap handwashing station could help in promoting handwashing practice in resource constraint settings. Future studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of tippy-tap hand washing station on preventing water and hygiene-related infections.","Mbakaya, Balwani Chingatichifwe; Kalembo, Fatch Welcome; Zgambo, Maggie",BMC Public Health,90,21

Recent Findings: The risk of transmission of respiratory viruses including COVID-19 is particularly high due to the overcrowding conditions at the Hajj and Umrah. The profile of the Hajj pilgrims who tend to be older and with multiple comorbidities corresponds to that of individuals at risk for severe COVID-19. In order to avoid a COVID-19 outbreak with potential spreading to many countries through returning pilgrims, Saudi Arabia suspended the Umrah, and access to the 2020 Hajj was very limited. Summary: A clear relation between early suspension of religious mass gatherings and lower occurrence of COVID-19 transmission in countries that took such measures promptly was noticed.

However, so far, functional molecular diodes have only been demonstrated in the very low alternating current frequency regime, which is partially due to their extremely low conductance and the poor degree of device integration. Here, we report about fully integrated rectifiers with microtubular soft-contacts, which are based on a molecularly thin organic heterojunction and are able to convert alternating current with a frequency of up to 10 MHz. The unidirectional current behavior of our devices originates mainly from the intrinsically different surfaces of the bottom planar and top microtubular Au electrodes while the excellent high frequency response benefits from the charge accumulation in the phthalocyanine molecular heterojunction, which not only improves the charge injection but also increases the carrier density.","Li, Tianming; Bandari, Vineeth Kumar; Hantusch, Martin; Xin, Jianhui; Kuhrt, Robert; Ravishankar, Rachappa; Xu, Longqian; Zhang, Jidong; Knupfer, Martin; Zhu, Feng; Yan, Donghang; Schmidt, Oliver G",Nat Commun,90,30

METHODS: Based on the sixth Standard Occupational Classification codes, 2015 census data were linked with data from the fifth Korean Working Conditions Survey, which measured how frequently workers directly come into contact with people other than fellow employees in the workplace. RESULTS: A total of 30 occupational groups, including 7 occupations from the healthcare and welfare sectors and 23 from other sectors, were classified as high-risk occupational groups involving frequent contact with people other than fellow employees in the workplace (more than half of the working hours). Approximately 1.4 million (women, 79.1%) and 10.7 million workers (46.3%) are employed in high-risk occupations. Occupations with a larger proportion of women are more likely to be at a high-risk of infection and are paid less. For wage-earners in high-risk occupations, protective resources to deal with COVID-19 (e.g., trade unions and health and safety committees) are less prevalent among temporary or daily workers than among those with permanent employment. CONCLUSIONS: Given the large number of Koreans employed in high-risk occupations and inequalities within the working population, the workplace needs to be the key locus for governmental actions to control COVID-19, and special consideration for vulnerable workers is warranted.","Lee, Juyeon; Kim, Myounghee",Epidemiol Health,90,16

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) and epicardial fat (EAT) have shown to outperform traditional risk factors in predicting cardiovascular events in the general population. We aim to determine if CAC and EAT determined by Computed Tomographic (CT) scanning can predict all-cause mortality in patients admitted with COVID-19 disease. We performed a retrospective, post-hoc analysis of all patients admitted to Montefiore Medical Center with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis from March 1st, 2020 to May 2nd, 2020 who had a non-contrast CT of the chest within 5 years prior to admission. We determined ordinal CAC scores and quantified the epicardial (EAT) and thoracic (TAT) fat volume and examined their relationship with inpatient mortality. A total of 493 patients were analyzed. There were 197 deaths (39.95%). Patients who died during the index admission had higher age (72, [64-80] vs 68, [57-76]; p < 0.001), CAC score (3, [0-6] vs 1, [0-4]; p < 0.001) and EAT (107, [70-152] vs 94, [64-129]; p = 0.023).

We aimed to investigate whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were associated with a decreased risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic reinfection. METHODS: A large, multicentre, prospective cohort study was done, with participants recruited from publicly funded hospitals in all regions of England. All health-care workers, support staff, and administrative staff working at hospitals who could remain engaged in follow-up for 12 months were eligible to join The SARS-CoV-2 Immunity and Reinfection Evaluation study. Participants were excluded if they had no PCR tests after enrolment, enrolled after Dec 31, 2020, or had insufficient PCR and antibody data for cohort assignment. Participants attended regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing (every 2-4 weeks) and completed questionnaires every 2 weeks on symptoms and exposures. At enrolment, participants were assigned to either the positive cohort (antibody positive, or previous positive PCR or antibody test) or negative cohort (antibody negative, no previous positive PCR or antibody test). The primary outcome was a reinfection in the positive cohort or a primary infection in the negative cohort, determined by PCR tests. Potential reinfections were clinically reviewed and classified according to case definitions (confirmed, probable, or possible) and symptom-status, depending on the hierarchy of evidence. Primary infections in the negative cohort were defined as a first positive PCR test and seroconversions were excluded when not associated with a positive PCR test. A proportional hazards frailty model using a Poisson distribution was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) to compare infection rates in the two cohorts. FINDINGS: From June 18, 2020, to Dec 31, 2020, 30 625 participants were enrolled into the study. 51 participants withdrew from the study, 4913 were excluded, and 25 661 participants (with linked data on antibody and PCR testing) were included in the analysis. Data were extracted from all sources on Feb 5, 2021, and include data up to and including Jan 11, 2021. 155 infections were detected in the baseline positive cohort of 8278 participants, collectively contributing 2 047 113 person-days of follow-up. This compares with 1704 new PCR positive infections in the negative cohort of 17 383 participants, contributing 2 971 436 person-days of follow-up. The incidence density was 7·6 reinfections per 100 000 person-days in the positive cohort, compared with 57·3 primary infections per 100 000 person-days in the negative cohort, between June, 2020, and January, 2021. The adjusted IRR was 0·159 for all reinfections (95% CI 0·13-0·19) compared with PCR-confirmed primary infections. The median interval between primary infection and reinfection was more than 200 days. INTERPRETATION: A previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an 84% lower risk of infection, with median protective effect observed 7 months following primary infection. This time period is the minimum probable effect because seroconversions were not included. This study shows that previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 induces effective immunity to future infections in most individuals.

Spatial configurations of structures may hinder or assist the spread of viruses in the built environment. In this study, we have hypothesized that suitable air ventilation in historic buildings may enhance the built environment to combat the spreading of infectious viruses. To provide such quantitative shreds of evidence, we have generated and estimated an integrated model to summarize obtained information by considering natural ventilation, wind speed, inflow and outflow, wind direction, and forecasting the associated risks of airborne disease transmission in a historical building (i.e., the Hazzazi House in particular). Intrinsically, the results have demonstrated that the effectiveness of natural ventilation has directly influenced reducing the risks of transmitting airborne infectious viruses for the selected heritage building in Jeddah (Saudi Arabia). The adopted methods in this research may be useful to understand the potentials of conserving old heritage buildings. Consequently, the results demonstrate that natural air ventilation systems are critical to combat the spread of infectious diseases in the pandemic.","Alaidroos, Alaa; Almaimani, Ayad; Baik, Ahmed; Al-Amodi, Mohamed; Rahaman, Khan Rubayet",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),90,1

However, the lack of adequate testing kits could be a bottleneck, especially in the case of unanticipated new diseases, such as COVID-19, where the testing technology, manufacturing capability, distribution, human skills and laboratories might be unavailable or in short supply. In addition, the cost of the standard PCR test is approximately USD 48, which is prohibitive for poorer patients and most governments. We address this bottleneck by proposing a test methodology that pools the sample from two (or more) patients in a single test. The key insight is that a single negative result from a pooled sample likely implies negative infection of all the individual patients. and It thereby rules out further tests for the patients. This protocol, therefore, requires significantly fewer tests. This may, however, result in somewhat increased false negatives. Our simulations show that combining samples from two patients with 7% underlying likelihood of infection implies that 36% fewer test kits are required, with 14% additional units of time for testing.","Jain, Tarun; Jain, Bijendra Nath",,90,27

DESIGN: Participants were recruited by an online survey in this cross-sectional study. The questionnaire included general demographic characteristics, level of fear and anxiety, and nutritional habits. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 test (GAD-7) were used to determine fear and anxiety. SETTING: Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: A total sample consisted of 1012 adults. RESULTS: In pandemic, fear and anxiety caused individuals to skip breakfast and snacks less, but more at lunch. A positive significant correlation was observed between the increased consumption of yoghurt, cheese and water and FCV-19S scores. There was a positive significant correlation between cheese, legume, nuts-seeds, cake-cookies, dessert and tea consumption and GAD-7 scores. A 1-unit increase in FCV-19S scores affected 1·04 times of increased consumption of yoghurt, kefir, cheese, nuts-seeds, fruit (dry) and rice-pasta. A 1-unit increase in GAD-7 scores affected 1·03 times of increased consumption of egg and fruit (fresh); 1·04 times of increased consumption of cheese and other vegetables; 1·05 times of increased consumption of milk, meat, poultry, fish, legume, nuts-seeds, fruit (dry), cake-cookies and tea; 1·07 times of increased consumption of rice-pasta and coffee and 1·08 times of increased consumption of bread and dessert. CONCLUSIONS: In pandemic, anxiety and fear led to changes in individuals' nutritional habits and food preferences.

When the amount of accessible cholesterol in the PM exceeds a threshold level, the excess cholesterol moves to the ER where it regulates the SREBP2 pathway and undergoes esterification. We reported previously that the Aster/Gramd1 family of sterol transporters mediates nonvesicular movement of cholesterol from the PM to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in multiple mammalian cell types. Here, we investigated the PM pool of accessible cholesterol in cholesterol-loaded fibroblasts with a knockdown of Aster-A and in mouse macrophages from Aster-B and Aster-A/B-deficient mice. Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) analyses revealed an expansion of the accessible cholesterol pool in cells lacking Aster expression. The increased accessible cholesterol pool in the PM was accompanied by reduced cholesterol to the ER, evident by increased expression of SREBP2-regulated genes. Co-sedimentation experiments with liposomes revealed that the Aster-B GRAM domain binds to membranes in a cholesterol concentration-dependent manner and that the binding is facilitated by the presence of phosphatidylserine. These studies reveal that the Aster-mediated nonvesicular cholesterol transport pathway controls levels of accessible cholesterol in the PM as well as the activity of the SREBP pathway.","Ferrari, Alessandra; He, Cuiwen; Kennelly, John Paul; Sandhu, Jaspreet; Xiao, Xu; Chi, Xun; Jiang, Haibo; Young, Stephen G; Tontonoz, Peter",Mol. cell. biol,90,1

Lack of a vaccine or optimized intervention raised the importance of characterizing risk factors and symptoms for the early identification and successful treatment of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate and analyze biomedical literature and public social media data to understand the association of risk factors and symptoms with the various outcomes observed in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Through semantic analysis, we collected 45 retrospective cohort studies, which evaluated 303 clinical and demographic variables across 13 different outcomes of patients with COVID-19, and 84,140 Twitter posts from 1036 COVID-19-positive users. Machine learning tools to extract biomedical information were introduced to identify mentions of uncommon or novel symptoms in tweets. We then examined and compared two data sets to expand our landscape of risk factors and symptoms related to COVID-19. RESULTS: From the biomedical literature, approximately 90% of clinical and demographic variables showed inconsistent associations with COVID-19 outcomes. Consensus analysis identified 72 risk factors that were specifically associated with individual outcomes. From the social media data, 51 symptoms were characterized and analyzed. By comparing social media data with biomedical literature, we identified 25 novel symptoms that were specifically mentioned in tweets but have been not previously well characterized. Furthermore, there were certain combinations of symptoms that were frequently mentioned together in social media. CONCLUSIONS: Identified outcome-specific risk factors, symptoms, and combinations of symptoms may serve as surrogate indicators to identify patients with COVID-19 and predict their clinical outcomes in order to provide appropriate treatments.","Jeon, Jouhyun; Baruah, Gaurav; Sarabadani, Sarah; Palanica, Adam",J Med Internet Res,90,30

T cells were isolated on histopaque density gradient by differential centrifugation, and were cultured with the mitogen concanavalin A (Con A), free radical generator (H2O2/FeSO4) and with different concentrations of L1 and [Cu(L1)] (1 - 100 µM). Proliferation (MTT assay), cytokines (Elisa kits), ATP levels, cytotoxic effect (micronucleus test) and oxidative markers (glutathione, catalase, superoxide dismutase, hydroperoxide and carbonyl protein contents) were investigated after 48-h incubation. Our results showed that H2O2/FeSO4 treatment induced a reduction in T lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine secretion and ATP levels associated to an evident intracellular oxidative stress, inflammatory profile and DNA damage. Addition of L1 at 100 µM was able to increase cell proliferation, IL-2, IL-4 and INFÎ³ secretion and ATP contents and to reduce hydroperoxide and carbonyl protein contents, catalase activity and micronuclei number in lymphocytes under oxidative stress, with a partial protection. The [Cu(L1)] exhibited protective effects in T lymphocytes by inhibiting H2O2/FeSO4 - induced cell proliferation suppression, inflammatory status, ATP loss and oxidative stress generation, whatever the concentration used. In conclusion, in the situation of excessive oxidative stress, [Cu(L1)] treatment improved T lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production, ATP contents and oxidant/antioxidant status. [Cu(L1)] could be effective at improving oxidative stress and T cell abnormalities.","Baba Hamed Benmansour, Y; Saidi Merzouk, A; Benmansour, A; Cherrak, S A; Merzouk, H",J. physiol. pharmacol,90,17

The secondary aims were to assess whether there were clinical factors associated with COVID-19 status, the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19, and the rate of potential COVID-19 in patients not presenting to healthcare services. METHODS: A multicentre retrospective study was conducted of patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (1 March 2020 to 31 March 2020) with a minimum of 60 days follow-up. Patient demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, procedure type, primary or revision, length of stay (LOS), COVID-19 test status, and postoperative mortality were recorded. A subgroup of patients (n = 211) who had not presented to healthcare services after discharge were contacted and questioned as to whether they had symptoms of COVID-19. RESULTS: Five (0.5%) of 1,073 patients who underwent hip or knee arthroplasty tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 postoperatively. When adjusting for confounding factors, increasing LOS (p = 0.022) was the only significant factor associated with developing COVID-19 following surgery and a stay greater than three days was a reliable predictor with an area under the curve of 81% (p = 0.018). There were three (0.3%) deaths in the study cohort and the overall mortality rate attributable to COVID-19 was 0.09% (n = 1/1,073), with one (20%) of the five patients with COVID-19 dying postoperatively. Of the 211 patients contacted, two had symptoms within two to 14 days postoperatively with a positive predictive value of 31% and it was therefore estimated that one patient may have had undiagnosed COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The rate of postoperative COVID-19 was 0.5% and may have been as high as 1% when accounting for those patients not presenting to healthcare services, which was similar to the estimated population prevalence during the study period.

However, little is known about families of children with Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD). The present study investigated parental stress, coparenting, and child adjustment in Italian families with children with NDD (N = 82) and typical developing children (TD, N = 82) during lockdown, using an online survey. Results of quantitative analyses showed a significant increase in parental stress and child externalizing behaviors, but not of coparenting. Parental stress is predicted by externalizing behaviors, and coparenting acted as a moderator in the relationship between the change in the amount of time spent with the children before and during lockdown and parental stress. In children with NDD, the decrease in therapeutic/rehabilitation support predicted higher externalizing behaviors. Qualitative analysis showed that beyond the difficulties and worries arising during lockdown, most of the parents appreciated the opportunity of spending more time with their children and strengthening the parent-child relationship. In conclusion, our results point out the importance of ensuring continuity of care for children with NDD (e.g. telehealth) during home confinement and of providing psychological support for parents.","Bentenuto, Arianna; Mazzoni, Noemi; Giannotti, Michele; Venuti, Paola; de Falco, Simona",Res Dev Disabil,90,16

However, research on their infection risk and clinical characteristics is limited. Objectives: To explore infection risk and clinical characteristics of HCWs with COVID-19 and to discuss possible prevention measures. Design, Setting, and Participants: This single-center case series included 9684 HCWs in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. Data were collected from January 1 to February 9, 2020. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Exposure, epidemiological, and demographic information was collected by a structured questionnaire. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic information was collected from electronic medical records. A total of 335 medical staff were randomly sampled to estimate the prevalence of subclinical infection among a high-risk, asymptomatic population. Samples from surfaces in health care settings were also collected. Results: Overall, 110 of 9684 HCWs in Tongji Hospital tested positive for COVID-19, with an infection rate of 1.1%. Of them, 70 (71.8%) were women, and they had a median (interquartile range) age of 36.5 (30.0-47.0) years. Seventeen (15.5%) worked in fever clinics or wards, indicating an infection rate of 0.5% (17 of 3110) among first-line HCWs. A total of 93 of 6574 non-first-line HCWs (1.4%) were infected. Non-first-line nurses younger than 45 years were more likely to be infected compared with first-line physicians aged 45 years or older (incident rate ratio, 16.1; 95% CI, 7.1-36.3; P < .001). The prevalence of subclinical infection was 0.74% (1 of 135) among asymptomatic first-line HCWs and 1.0% (2 of 200) among non-first-line HCWs. No environmental surfaces tested positive. Overall, 93 of 110 HCWs (84.5%) with COVID-19 had nonsevere disease, while 1 (0.9%) died. The 5 most common symptoms were fever (67 [60.9%]), myalgia or fatigue (66 [60.0%]), cough (62 [56.4%]), sore throat (55 [50.0%]), and muscle ache (50 [45.5%]). Contact with indexed patients (65 [59.1%]) and colleagues with infection (12 [10.9%]) as well as community-acquired infection (14 [12.7%]) were the main routes of exposure for HCWs. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series, most infections among HCWs occurred during the early stage of disease outbreak. That non-first-line HCWs had a higher infection rate than first-line HCWs differed from observation of previous viral disease epidemics. Rapid identification of staff with potential infection and routine screening among asymptomatic staff could help protect HCWs.","Lai, Xiaoquan; Wang, Minghuan; Qin, Chuan; Tan, Li; Ran, Lusen; Chen, Daiqi; Zhang, Han; Shang, Ke; Xia, Chen; Wang, Shaokang; Xu, Shabei; Wang, Wei",JAMA Netw Open,90,24

Though mass vaccination will certainly help in reducing number of COVID-19 patients, an effective therapeutic measure must be available too. Intravenous remdesivir (RDV) was the first drug receiving Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of COVID-19. However, in a pandemic like COVID-19, it is essential that drug formulations are readily available, affordable and convenient to administer to every patient around the globe. In this study, we have developed a Self-injectable extended release subcutaneous injection of Remdesivir (SelfExRem) for the treatment of COVID-19. As opposed to intravenous injection, extended release subcutaneous injection has the benefits of reducing face-to-face contact, minimizing hospitalization, reducing dosing frequency and reducing overall health care cost. SelfExRem was developed using a biodegradable polymer, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), dissolved in a biocompatible vehicle. Six different batches were formulated using 2 different grades of low molecular weight PLGA and 3 different PLGA concentration. The force of injection of various polymeric solutions through 23-30-gauge needles were analyzed using a TA.XTplus texture analyzer. The time required for injection was evaluated both manually and by using an autoinjector. In vitro release of all the batches were carried out in 1% v/v tween 80 in phosphate buffer saline. The study indicated that SelfExRem developed with15% w/v PLGA(75:25) provided a steady release of drug for 48 h and may be a breakthrough approach for the treatment of COVID-19.","Patki, Manali; Palekar, Siddhant; Reznik, Sandra; Patel, Ketan",Int J Pharm,90,2

DESIGN: Multicenter retrospective cohort study. SETTING: One Level 1 trauma center and one orthopaedic specialty hospital in New York City. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-nine consecutive patients (average age 85 years, range: 65-100 years) treated for a hip fracture (OTA/AO 31, 32.1) over a 5-week period, March 20, 2020, to April 24, 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 crisis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: COVID-19 infection status was used to stratify patients. The primary outcome was inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes were admission to the intensive care unit, unexpected intubation, pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, urinary tract infection, and transfusion. Baseline demographics, comorbidities, treatment characteristics, and COVID-related symptomatology were also evaluated. RESULTS: Ten patients (15%) tested positive for COVID-19 (COVID+) (n = 9; 7 preoperatively and 2 postoperatively) or were presumed positive (n = 1), 40 (68%) patients tested negative, and 9 (15%) patients were not tested in the primary hospitalization. American Society of Anesthesiologists' scores were higher in the COVID+ group (d = -0.83; P = 0.04); however, the Charlson Comorbidity Index was similar between the study groups (d = -0.17; P = 0.63). Inpatient mortality was significantly increased in the COVID+ cohort (56% vs. 4%; odds ratio 30.0, 95% confidence interval 4.3-207; P = 0.001). Including the one presumed positive case in the COVID+ cohort increased this difference (60% vs. 2%; odds ratio 72.0, 95% confidence interval 7.9-754; P < 0.001).

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of COVID-19 because of their profession. There are limited studies conducted in Ethiopia among HCWs regarding their compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures. Therefore, this study intended to assess HCWs' compliance with measures to prevent COVID-19, and its potential determinants in public hospitals in Western Ethiopia. METHODS: A self-administered, multicenter hospital-based cross-sectional survey was proposed to 422 randomly selected HCWs working in seven public hospitals in Western Ethiopia identified as COVID-19 referral centers. Data were entered into Epi Data version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 24. Binary logistic regression was used to identify potential determinants of outcome variables at p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: Out of 422 completed questionnaires, the overall HCWs' compliance with COVID-19 prevention is 22% (n = 404). In multivariate regression analysis, factors such as spending most of caring time at bedside (AOR = 1.94, 95%CI, 1.06-3.55), receiving training on infection prevention/COVID-19 (AOR = 1.86, 95%CI, 1.04-3.33), reading materials on COVID-19 (AOR = 2.04, 95%CI, 1.14-3.63) and having support from hospital management (AOR = 2.09, 95%CI, 1.20-3.64) were found to be significantly associated with COVID-19 preventive measures. Furthermore, inadequate supplies of appropriate personal protective equipment (83.2%), insufficient supportive medications (78.5%), and lack of provision of adequate ventilation (77.7%) were the barriers to COVID-19 prevention most frequently mentioned by participants. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight HCWs' poor compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures. Providing information and refreshing training to improve the level of healthcare workers' adherence with COVID-19 prevention is as imperative as increasing staff commitment to supply resources necessary to protect HCWs and to reduce healthcare-associated infections transmission of SARS-COV-2.","Etafa, Werku; Gadisa, Gosa; Jabessa, Shibiru; Takele, Tagay",BMC Infect Dis,90,16

METHODS: As a part of an ongoing prospective study to identify the etiology of viral respiratory infections in Spain, we performed the analysis of HCoV infections in children hospitalized in a secondary hospital in Madrid, between October 2005 and June 2018. Clinical data of HCoV patients were compared with those infected by rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 5131 hospitalizations for respiratory causes in children. A total of 3901 cases (75.9%) had a positive viral identification and 205 cases (4.1%) were positive for HCoV. Only 41 cases (20%) of HCoV infection were detected as single infections. Episodes of recurrent wheezing were the most common diagnosis, and 112 children (54%) had hypoxia. Clinical data in HCoV cases were similar to those associated with rhinovirus; however, patients with HCoV were younger. Other viruses were associated with hypoxia more frequently than cases with HCoV; high fever was more common in influenza infections and bronchiolitis in respiratory syncytial virus group. Although a slight peak of circulation appears mostly in winter, HCoV has been detected throughout the year as well. CONCLUSIONS: HCoV infections represent a small fraction of respiratory infections that require hospitalization in children and their characteristics do not differ greatly from other respiratory viral infections.","Calvo, Cristina; Alcolea, Sonia; Casas, Inmaculada; Pozo, Francisco; Iglesias, María; Gonzalez-Esguevillas, Mónica; Luz García-García, María",Pediatr Infect Dis J,90,24

Since no specific therapeutics are available, researchers around the world screened compounds to inhibit various molecular targets of SARS-CoV-2 including its main protease (Mpro) essential for viral replication. Due to the high urgency of these discovery efforts, off-target binding, which is one of the major reasons for drug-induced toxicity and safety-related drug attrition, was neglected. Here, we used molecular docking, toxicity profiling, and multiple molecular dynamics (MD) protocols to assess the selectivity of 33 reported non-covalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro against eight proteases and 16 anti-targets. The panel of proteases included SARS-CoV Mpro, cathepsin G, caspase-3, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), thrombin, factor Xa, chymase, and prostasin. Several of the assessed compounds presented considerable off-target binding towards the panel of proteases, as well as the selected anti-targets. Our results further suggest a high risk of off-target binding to chymase and cathepsin G. Thus, in future discovery projects, experimental selectivity assessment should be directed toward these proteases.

Along with psychosocial consequences, it is possible that sexual behavior was also affected. AIMS: With the present study, we evaluated the impact of the community-wide containment and consequent social distancing on the intrapsychic, relational, and sexual health through standardized psychometric tools. METHODS: A case-control study was performed through a web-based survey and comparing subjects of both genders with (group A, N = 2,608) and without (group B, N = 4,213) sexual activity during lockdown. The Welch and chi-square tests were used to assess differences between groups. Univariate analysis of covariance, logistic regression models, and structural equation modeling were performed to measure influence and mediation effects of sexual activity on psychological, relational, and sexual outcomes. OUTCOMES: Main outcome measures were General Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression, Dyadic Adjustment Scale for quality of relationship and a set of well-validated sexological inventories (International Index of Erectile Function, Female Sexual Function Index, and male-female versions of the Orgasmometer). RESULTS: Anxiety and depression scores were significantly lower in subjects sexually active during lockdown. Analysis of covariance identified gender, sexual activity, and living without partner during lockdown as significantly affecting anxiety and depression scores (P < .0001). Logistic regression models showed that lack of sexual activity during lockdown was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing anxiety and depression (OR: 1.32 [95% CI: 1.12 - 1.57, P < .001] and 1.34 [95% CI: 1.15 - 1.57, P < .0001], respectively). Structural equation modeling evidenced the protective role of sexual activity toward psychological distress (ßmales = -0.18 and ßfemales = -0.14), relational health (ßmales = 0.26 and ßfemales = 0.29) and sexual health, both directly (ßmales = 0.43 and ßfemales = 0.31), and indirectly (ßmales = 0.13 and ßfemales = 0.13). CLINICAL TRANSLATION: The demonstrated mutual influence of sexual health on psychological and relational health could direct the clinical community toward a reinterpretation of the relationship among these factors. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Based on a large number of subjects and well-validated psychometric tools, this study elucidated the protective role of sexual activity for psychological distress, as well for relational and sexual health. Main limitations were the web-based characteristics of the protocol and the retrospective nature of prelockdown data on psychorelational and sexual health of subjects recruited. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 lockdown dramatically impacted on psychological, relational, and sexual health of the population. In this scenario, sexual activity played a protective effect, in both genders, on the quarantine-related plague of anxiety and mood disorders. Mollaioli D, Sansone A, Ciocca G, et al.

Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients are generally at high-risk for COVID-19 infection and severe adverse outcomes. Further, there are new, multilevel COVID-19-specific risks to patients, surgeons, health care workers (HCWs), institutions and society. Urgent guidance in the delivery of safe, quality head and neck oncologic care is needed. Novel barriers to safe HNC surgery include: (1) imperfect presurgical screening for COVID-19; (2) prolonged SARS-CoV-2 aerosolization; (3) occurrence of multiple, potentially lengthy, aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) within a single surgery; (4) potential incompatibility of enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE) with routine operative equipment; (5) existential or anticipated PPE shortages. Additionally, novel, COVID-19-specific multilevel risks to HNC patients, HCWs and institutions, and society include: use of immunosuppressive therapy, nosocomial COVID-19 transmission, institutional COVID-19 outbreaks, and, at some locations, societal resource deficiencies requiring health care rationing. Traditional head and neck oncology doctrines require reassessment given the extraordinary COVID-19-specific risks of surgery. Emergent, comprehensive management of these novel, multilevel surgical risks are needed. Until these risks are managed, we temporarily favor nonsurgical therapy over surgery for most mucosal squamous cell carcinomas, wherein surgery and nonsurgical therapy are both first-line options. Where surgery is traditionally preferred, we recommend multidisciplinary evaluation of multilevel surgical-risks, discussion of possible alternative nonsurgical therapies and shared-decision-making with the patient. Where surgery remains indicated, we recommend judicious preoperative planning and development of COVID-19-specific perioperative protocols to maximize the safety and quality of surgical and oncologic care.","Day, Andrew T; Sher, David J; Lee, Rebecca C; Truelson, John M; Myers, Larry L; Sumer, Baran D; Stankova, Lenka; Tillman, Brittny N; Hughes, Randall S; Khan, Saad A; Gordin, Eli A",Oral Oncol,90,26

Although a few media reports mentioned the existence of coronavirus-themed mobile malware, the research community lacks the understanding of the landscape of the coronavirus-themed mobile malware, and there is no publicly accessible dataset that could be utilized to boost the related research. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of coronavirus-themed mobile malware. We first make efforts to create a daily growing COVID-19 themed mobile app dataset, which contains $2,016$ COVID-19 themed apps and $277$ malware samples by the time of May 26, 2020. We then present an analysis of these apps from multiple perspectives including popularity and trends, installation methods, malicious behaviors and malicious campaigns. We observe that the growth of the number of COVID-19 themed apps is highly related to the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the world. Most of them were released through distribution channels beyond app markets. A majority of the malicious apps (over 53%) are camouflaged as official apps using the same app identifiers and some of them use confusing similar app icons with the official ones to mislead users. Their main purposes are either stealing users' private information or making profit by using the tricks like phishing and extortion. Furthermore, we find that only 40\% of the COVID-19 malware creators are habitual developers who are active for a long time, while 60\% of them are new emerging ones in this pandemic and only released COVID-19 themed malware. The malicious developers are mainly located in US, mostly targeting countries including English countries, Arabic countries, Europe and China. To facilitate future research, we have publicly released all the well-labelled COVID-19 themed apps (and malware) to the research community.","He, Ren; Wang, Haoyu; Xia, Pengcheng; Wang, Liu; Li, Yuanchun; Wu, Lei; Zhou, Yajin; Luo, Xiapu; Guo, Yao; Xu, Guoai",,90,24

OBJECTIVE: To quantify demographic, occupational, and community risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among HCWs in a large health care system. DESIGN: A logistic regression model was fitted to data from a cross-sectional survey conducted in April to June 2020, linking risk factors for occupational and community exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. SETTING: A large academic health care system in the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area. PARTICIPANTS: Employees and medical staff members elected to participate in SARS-CoV-2 serology testing offered to all HCWs as part of a quality initiative and completed a survey on exposure to COVID-19 and use of personal protective equipment. MEASUREMENTS: Demographic risk factors for COVID-19, residential ZIP code incidence of COVID-19, occupational exposure to HCWs or patients who tested positive on polymerase chain reaction test, and use of personal protective equipment as potential risk factors for infection. The outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. RESULTS: Adjusted SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was estimated to be 3.8% (95% CI, 3.4%-4.3%) (positive, n = 582) among the 10 275 HCWs (35% of the Emory Healthcare workforce) who participated in the survey. Community contact with a person known or suspected to have COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.9 [CI, 1.4 to 2.6]; 77 positive persons [10.3%]) and community COVID-19 incidence (aOR, 1.5 [CI, 1.0 to 2.2]) increased the odds of infection. Black individuals were at high risk (aOR, 2.1 [CI, 1.7 to 2.6]; 238 positive persons [8.3%]). LIMITATIONS: Participation rates were modest and key workplace exposures, including job and infection prevention practices, changed rapidly in the early phases of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Demographic and community risk factors, including contact with a COVID-19-positive person and Black race, are more strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among HCWs than is exposure in the workplace.

To sustain the response towards the pandemic, many hospitals have adapted to virtual healthcare and telemedicine. Google&#8482; has become the most widely used search engine over the years. Google Trends&#8482; can be used to depict the public interest over a certain topic. The output of the Google Trends&#8482; is displayed as relative search volume (RSV) which is the proportionate search volume regarding a specific topic comparative to the total search volume in a specific time and region. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the daily reported number of new COVID-19 cases and deaths and the corresponding changes in Google Trends&#8482; RSV of telehealth over six months. Methods A retrospective study was conducted from January 21, 2020 to July 21, 2020. About 17 countries that reported the total number of cases greater than 200,000 in the situation report of July 21, 2020 were selected to be a part of this study. The daily reported new cases and deaths globally and of the selected countries were extracted from the World Health Organization (WHO) situation reports. The combination of keywords used for obtaining the RSV data through Google Trends&#8482; was ""telehealth"", ""telemedicine"", ""mHealth"", and ""eHealth"". These words were used with the ""+"" feature of Google Trends&#8482; with ""1/21/2020 to 7/21/2020"" as time range, ""all categories"" for the category, and ""web search"" for the type of search. The worldwide RSV as well as the RSVs of the selected countries were obtained from the Google Trends&#8482; website. Spearman's correlation coefficient (&#961;) was used to determine the strength of the relationship between new cases or deaths and RSVs related to telehealth. Results A positive fair correlation was established between the global interest in telehealth and the new cases (&#961;=0.307, p-value<0.001) and deaths (&#961;=0.469, p-value<0.001) reported worldwide. The United States of America (USA), India, and Bangladesh were found to have a positive fair correlation between the public interest regarding telehealth and the emerging new COVID-19 cases and deaths. The United Kingdom (UK) and Italy demonstrated a positive poor correlation between the rising new cases or deaths and RSV. Similar statistics were noted for the daily new cases of Chile. For Turkey, a positive fair correlation between new deaths and RSV while a positive poor correlation between new cases and RSV was observed. No significant correlation was observed for the rest of the selected countries. Conclusion This study highlights the steadily rising public interest in telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine can provide the necessary remote consultation and healthcare for patients in the current situation. However, previous studies have shown that the majority of the countries are inadequately equipped for the digitization of the healthcare system. Therefore, it has become necessary to incorporate telemedicine into the healthcare system to combat any possible pandemic in the future.","Arshad Ali, Shajeea; Bin Arif, Taha; Maab, Hira; Baloch, Mariam; Manazir, Sana; Jawed, Fatima; Ochani, Rohan Kumar",Cureus,90,4

Using the monthly number FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) approvals from 1939 to 2019 as the data source, it is demonstrated that US approvals are found to have a distinct S-shaped (trichotomized) long-range CHE structure: an 8-year (1939-1947) Stagnated (random; H of 0.5), a 27-year (1947-1974) Emergent (time-varying persistent; H between 0.5 and 0.9), and the 45-year (1974-2019) Saturated (persistent; H of 1) US Approvals Hurst Cycles. Further, dominant periodicities (resolved via wavelet analyses) are identified in the Saturated Period at 17, 8 and 4 years; thus, US Approvals have been following a Juglar/Kuznet mid-term cycle with Kitchin-like bursts. This work suggests that (1) macro-factors in the Emergent Period have led to persistent growth in US approvals enjoyed since 1974, (2) the CHE may be a valued method to explore the constancy of extrinsic pressures on time series data, and (3) adds further evidence that innovation-related economic cycles exist (as supported via the proxy metric of US drug approvals).","Daizadeh, Iraj",,90,1

Because we recently reported neurophysiological brainstem reflex abnormalities in COVID-19 patients, we here neuropathologically assessed structural brainstem damage in two COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed neuropathological features in two patients who died of COVID-19 and in two COVID-19 negative patients as controls. Neuronal damage and corpora amylacea (CA) numbers /mm2 were histopathologically assessed. Other features studied were the immunohistochemical expression of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) and the Iba-1 antigen for glial activation. RESULTS: Autopsies showed normal gross brainstem anatomy. Histopathological examination demonstrated increased neuronal and CA damage in Covid-19 patients' medulla oblongata. Immunohistochemistry disclosed SARS-CoV-2 NP in brainstem neurons and glial cells, and in cranial nerves. Glial elements also exhibited a widespread increase in Iba-1 expression. Sars-Co-V2 was immunohistochemically detected in the vagus nerve fibers. DISCUSSION: Neuropathologic evidence showing SARS-CoV-2 in the brainstem and medullary damage in the area of respiratory centers strongly suggests that the pathophysiology of COVID-19-related respiratory failure includes a neurogenic component. Sars-Co-V2 detection in the vagus nerve, argues for viral trafficking between brainstem and lung.","Bulfamante, Gaetano; Bocci, Tommaso; Falleni, Monica; Campiglio, Laura; Coppola, Silvia; Tosi, Delfina; Chiumello, Davide; Priori, Alberto",J. neurol,90,16

In many countries, regulatory councils for health professionals guide the development and implementation of health workforce policy, but struggle to perform their responsibilities, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Few studies have analyzed the influence of colonialism on modern-day regulatory policy for health workforces in LMICs. Drawing on the example of regulatory policy from India, the goals of this paper is to uncover and highlight the colonial legacies of persistent challenges in medical education and practice within the country, and provide lessons for regulatory policy in India and other LMICs. MAIN BODY: Drawing on peer-reviewed and gray literature, this paper explores the colonial origins of the regulation of medical education and practice in India. We describe three major aspects: (1) Evolution of the structure of the apex regulatory council for doctors-the Medical Council of India (MCI); (2) Reciprocity of medical qualifications between the MCI and the General Medical Council (GMC) in the UK following independence from Britain; (3) Regulatory imbalances between doctors and other cadres, and between biomedicine and Indian systems of medicine. CONCLUSIONS: Challenges in medical education and professional regulation remain a major obstacle to improve the availability, retention and quality of health workers in India and many other LMICs. We conclude that the colonial origins of regulatory policy in India provide critical insight into contemporary debates regarding reform. From a policy perspective, we need to carefully interrogate why our existing policies are framed in particular ways, and consider whether that framing continues to suit our needs in the twenty-first century.","Sriram, Veena; Keshri, Vikash R; Kumbhar, Kiran",Hum Resour Health,90,6

This study sought to assess COVID-19-related fear, depression, anxiety and stress among hospital staff, potential factors that may help reduce its psychological effects and their personal coping strategies. The study will help to highlight the psychological impact of COVID-19 on Ghanaian health workers and indirectly serve as a needs assessment survey for input to support affected staff and the broader health system. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among health workers in three hospitals in the Ashanti Region of Ghana from 11 July 2020 to 12 August 2020. Demographic data and scores from the validated DASS-21 and Fear of COVID-19 scales and two other scales developed de novo were entered from 272 self-administered questionnaires and analyzed for means, frequencies and proportions. Fisher's exact test analysis was done to ascertain associations between selected independent variables and depression, anxiety, stress and fear. Parametric and non-parametric tests were used to compare the mean and median scores of the outcome variables across the three study hospitals. Results and conclusion: Over 40% of respondents had fear while 21.1%, 27.8% and 8.2% had depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. Positive attitudes from colleagues and the government's tax-free salary relief were some factors said to reduce the psychological effects while over half of participants indicated praying more often as a coping strategy. There is a need for the health system to recognize the presence of these adverse psychological effects in health workers and take pragmatic steps to address them.","Ofori, Anthony Amanfo; Osarfo, Joseph; Agbeno, Evans Kofi; Manu, Dominic Owusu; Amoah, Elsie",SAGE Open Med,90,25

This research field, however, is relatively more recent and limited compared to investigations of the neural mechanisms underlying object and scene category recognition. Motion is particularly important for the perception of non-rigid materials, but the neural basis of non-rigid material motion remains unexplored. Using fMRI, we investigated which brain regions respond preferentially to material motion versus other types of motion. We introduce a new database of stimuli - dynamic dot materials - that are animations of moving dots that induce vivid percepts of various materials in motion, e.g. flapping cloth, liquid waves, wobbling jelly. Control stimuli were scrambled versions of these same animations and rigid three-dimensional rotating dots. Results showed that isolating material motion properties with dynamic dots (in contrast with other kinds of motion) activates a network of cortical regions in both ventral and dorsal visual pathways, including areas normally associated with the processing of surface properties and shape, and extending to somatosensory and premotor cortices. We suggest that such a widespread preference for material motion is due to strong associations between stimulus properties. For example viewing dots moving in a specific pattern not only elicits percepts of material motion; one perceives a flexible, non-rigid shape, identifies the object as a cloth flapping in the wind, infers the object's weight under gravity, and anticipates how it would feel to reach out and touch the material. These results are a first important step in mapping out the cortical architecture and dynamics in material-related motion processing.","Schmid, Alexandra C; Boyaci, Huseyin; Doerschner, Katja",Neuroimage,90,4

METHODS: We probed potential interactions between these pathogens among adults aged &#8805;65y by measuring associations of COVID-19 outcomes with pneumococcal vaccination (13-valent conjugate and 23-valent polysaccharide; PCV13, PPSV23). We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) using Cox proportional hazards models with doubly-robust inverse-propensity weighting. We assessed effect modification by antibiotic exposure to further test the biologic plausibility of a causal role for pneumococci. RESULTS: Among 531,033 adults, there were 3,677 COVID-19 diagnoses, leading to 1,075 hospitalizations and 334 fatalities, between 1 March-22 July, 2020.

Solutions in the Republic of Ireland include use of smart communication channels to improve supply chain, bespoke production of PPE to meets gaps, along with least preferred option, use of sterilization or high-level disinfection for PPE reprocessing. Reprocessing PPE must consider material composition, functionality post treatment, along with appropriate disinfection. Following original manufacturer of PPE and regulatory guidance is important. Technologies deployed in the US, and for deployment in the Republic of Ireland, are eco-friendly, namely vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VH2O2), such as for filtering facepiece respirators and UV irradiation and High-level liquid disinfection (Actichlor+) is also been pursed in Ireland. Safeguarding supply chain of PPE will sustain vital healthcare provision and will help reduce mortality.","Rowan, Neil J; Laffey, John G",Sci Total Environ,90,16

This knowledge is tested annually with the American Board for Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE) exam and is used to evaluate several aspects of a resident. We hypothesized that using a jeopardy game in educational conference would encourage residents to engage in self-learning and improve ABSITE scores at a single institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At a single institution, during protected education conference, residents played an hour-long surgical jeopardy game every 7 wk to summarize high yield topics discussed during the previous 6 wk of didactic learning. A 5-point Likert survey was completed by general surgery residents to discern the utility of the game format for learning. The ABSITE category scores were also evaluated from the year before and the year after the game was implemented. RESULTS: Twenty-four general surgery residents took the survey with >80% agreeing that the jeopardy format was either a fun or an effective way to learn general surgery topics. Additionally, over 80% of residents thought the game format helped with retention of knowledge. ABSITE categories that had a jeopardy session improved from 65.9% to 70.4% correct (P = 0.0003). ABSITE categories that did not have dedicated jeopardy had a non-significant increase in scores (67.7%-69.9%, P = 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: Implementing surgical jeopardy as a component of educational conferences in general surgery resident training is correlated with improvement of ABSITE scores. Surgical jeopardy may be easily adopted and implemented to stimulate self-directed learning for residents.","Hancock, Kevin J; Klimberg, V Suzanne; Williams, Taylor P; Tyler, Douglas S; Radhakrishnan, Ravi; Tran, Sifrance",J Surg Res,90,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. The OE-MRI was based on a respiratory-gated three-dimensional (3D) radial UTE sequence. For each patient, the percent signal enhancement (PSE) map was calculated using the expression PSE = (S100% - S21%)/S21%, where S21% and S100% are signals acquired during room air and 100% oxygen inhalation, respectively. Agreement of lesion detectability between UTE-MRI and computed tomography (CT) was performed using the kappa test. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to evaluate the difference in the mean PSE between mild-type COVID-19 and common-type COVID-19. Spearman's test was used to assess the relationship between lesion mean PSE and lesion size. Furthermore, the Mann-Whitney U-test was used to evaluate the difference in region of interest (ROI) mean PSE between normal pulmonary parenchyma and lesions. The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to test the difference in the mean PSE between different lesion types. RESULTS: CT and UTE-MRI reached good agreement in lesion detectability. Ventilation measures in mild-type patients (5.3 ± 5.5%) were significantly different from those in common-type patients (3 ± 3.9%). Besides, there was no significant correlation between lesion mean PSE and lesion size. The mean PSE of COVID-19 lesions (3.2 ± 4.9%) was significantly lower than that of the pulmonary parenchyma (5.4 ± 3.9%). No significant difference was found among different lesion types. CONCLUSION: OE-UTE-MRI could serve as a promising method for the assessment of lung function or treatment management of COVID-19 patients.","Zhao, F; Zheng, L; Shan, F; Dai, Y; Shen, J; Yang, S; Shi, Y; Xue, K; Zhang, Z",Clin Radiol,90,24

There is limited scientific evidence of the knowledge, perception, attitude and behavior patterns of the urban population. A computerized randomized digital dialing, cross-sectional, population landline-based telephone survey was conducted from 22 March to 1 April 2020 in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China. Data were collected for socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitude and risk perception, and various self-reported Health-EDRM behavior patterns associated with COVID-19. The final study sample was 765. Although the respondents thought that individuals (68.6%) had similar responsibilities as government (67.5%) in infection control, less than 50% had sufficient health risk management knowledge to safeguard health and well-being. Among the examined Health-EDRM measures, significant differences were found between attitude and practice in regards to washing hands with soap, ordering takeaways, wearing masks, avoidance of visiting public places or using public transport, and travel avoidance to COVID-19-confirmed regions. Logistic regression indicated that the elderly were less likely to worry about infection with COVID-19. Compared to personal and household hygiene practices, lower compliance was found for public social distancing.","Chan, Emily Ying Yang; Huang, Zhe; Lo, Eugene Siu Kai; Hung, Kevin Kei Ching; Wong, Eliza Lai Yi; Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),90,26

We aimed to determine the factors associated with vaccine coverage for both vaccines and documented the vaccine effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in a cohort of health-care workers undergoing regular asymptomatic testing. METHODS: The SIREN study is a prospective cohort study among staff (aged &#8805;18 years) working in publicly-funded hospitals in the UK. Participants were assigned into either the positive cohort (antibody positive or history of infection [indicated by previous positivity of antibody or PCR tests]) or the negative cohort (antibody negative with no previous positive test) at the beginning of the follow-up period. Baseline risk factors were collected at enrolment, symptom status was collected every 2 weeks, and vaccination status was collected through linkage to the National Immunisations Management System and questionnaires. Participants had fortnightly asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and monthly antibody testing, and all tests (including symptomatic testing) outside SIREN were captured. Data cutoff for this analysis was Feb 5, 2021. The follow-up period was Dec 7, 2020, to Feb 5, 2021. The primary outcomes were vaccinated participants (binary ever vacinated variable; indicated by at least one vaccine dose recorded by at least one of the two vaccination data sources) for the vaccine coverage analysis and SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a PCR test for the vaccine effectiveness analysis. We did a mixed-effect logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with vaccine coverage. We used a piecewise exponential hazard mixed-effects model (shared frailty-type model) using a Poisson distribution to calculate hazard ratios to compare time-to-infection in unvaccinated and vaccinated participants and estimate the impact of the BNT162b2 vaccine on all PCR-positive infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic). This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN11041050, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: 23 324 participants from 104 sites (all in England) met the inclusion criteria for this analysis and were enrolled. Included participants had a median age of 46·1 years (IQR 36·0-54·1) and 19 692 (84%) were female; 8203 (35%) were assigned to the positive cohort at the start of the analysis period, and 15 121 (65%) assigned to the negative cohort. Total follow-up time was 2 calendar months and 1 106 905 person-days (396 318 vaccinated and 710 587 unvaccinated). Vaccine coverage was 89% on Feb 5, 2021, 94% of whom had BNT162b2 vaccine. Significantly lower coverage was associated with previous infection, gender, age, ethnicity, job role, and Index of Multiple Deprivation score. During follow-up, there were 977 new infections in the unvaccinated cohort, an incidence density of 14 infections per 10 000 person-days; the vaccinated cohort had 71 new infections 21 days or more after their first dose (incidence density of eight infections per 10 000 person-days) and nine infections 7 days after the second dose (incidence density four infections per 10 000 person-days). In the unvaccinated cohort, 543 (56%) participants had typical COVID-19 symptoms and 140 (14%) were asymptomatic on or 14 days before their PCR positive test date, compared with 29 (36%) with typical COVID-19 symptoms and 15 (19%) asymptomatic in the vaccinated cohort. A single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine showed vaccine effectiveness of 70% (95% CI 55-85) 21 days after first dose and 85% (74-96) 7 days after two doses in the study population. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that the BNT162b2 vaccine can prevent both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in working-age adults. This cohort was vaccinated when the dominant variant in circulation was B1.1.7 and shows effectiveness against this variant.

The expected advantages of this new technology over the traditional method of contact tracing include speed, specificity, and mass reach. Beyond its use for mitigating and containing COVID-19, digital technology can complement or even augment the traditional approach to global health program implementation. However, as with any new system, strong regulatory frameworks are necessary to ensure that individual information is not used for surveillance purposes, and user privacy will be maintained. Having safeguarded this, perhaps the global health community will witness the beginning of a new era of implementing mass health programs through the medium of digital technology.","Owusu, Priscilla N",Glob Health Res Policy,90,6

This paper aims to bridge the gap between these two approaches by showing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques can shed new lights on portfolio allocation thanks to a more general optimization setting that casts portfolio allocation as an optimal control problem that is not just a one-step optimization, but rather a continuous control optimization with a delayed reward. The advantages are numerous: (i) DRL maps directly market conditions to actions by design and hence should adapt to changing environment, (ii) DRL does not rely on any traditional financial risk assumptions like that risk is represented by variance, (iii) DRL can incorporate additional data and be a multi inputs method as opposed to more traditional optimization methods.

Alterations in the inflammatory cytokines pathway represent a strong signature during SARS-COV-2 infection and correlate with poor prognosis and severity of the illness. The hyper-activation of the immune system results in an acute severe systemic inflammatory response named cytokine release syndrome (CRS). No effective prophylactic or post-exposure treatments are available, although some anti-inflammatory compounds are currently in clinical trials. Studies of plant extracts and natural compounds show that polyphenols can play a beneficial role in the prevention and the progress of chronic diseases related to inflammation. The aim of this manuscript is to review the published background on the possible effectiveness of polyphenols to fight SARS-COV-2 infection, contributing to the reduction of inflammation. Here, some of the anti-inflammatory therapies are discussed and although great progress has been made though this year, there is no proven cytokine blocking agents for COVID currently used in clinical practice. In this regard, bioactive phytochemicals such as polyphenols may become promising tools to be used as adjuvants in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such nutrients, with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, associated to classical anti-inflammatory drugs, could help in reducing the inflammation in patients with COVID-19.","Giovinazzo, Giovanna; Gerardi, Carmela; Uberti-Foppa, Caterina; Lopalco, Lucia",Molecules (Basel),90,10

In those patients who develop worsening pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), high concentrations of oxygen may need to be administered for prolonged time periods, often together with mechanical ventilation. Hyperoxia, although lifesaving and essential for maintaining adequate oxygenation in the short-term, may have adverse long-term consequences upon lung parenchymal structure and function. How hyperoxia per se impacts lung disease in COVID-19 has remained largely unexplored. Numbers of experimental studies have previously established that hyperoxia is associated with deleterious outcomes inclusive of: perturbations in immunologic responses; abnormal metabolic function and alterations in hemodynamics and alveolar barrier function. Such changes may ultimately progress into clinically evident lung injury, adverse remodeling and result in parenchymal fibrosis when exposure is prolonged. Given that significant exposure to hyperoxia in patients with severe COVID-19 may be unavoidable to preserve life, these sequelae of hyperoxia, superimposed on the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 virus may well impact pathogenesis of COVID-19-induced ARDS.","Hanidziar, Dusan; Robson, Simon C","Am. j. physiol., lung cell. mol. physiol",90,24

We performed a systematic literature review and a meta-analysis of the incidence of BNS after transurethral procedures for BPH. METHODS: We performed a systemic literature review using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Controlled Register of Trials. We accepted only randomized trials comparing transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) vs. other transurethral surgery for BPH that were grouped in Ablation vs. Enucleation modalities. The incidences of BNS were pooled using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Method with the random effect model and expressed as Risk Ratios, 95% Confidence Intervals, and p values. Study heterogeneity was assessed utilizing the I2 value. RESULTS: 72 studies were identified for meta-analysis, 46 comparing TURP vs. Ablation and 26 TURP vs. Enucleation. The pooled incidence of BNS was 1.3% after TURP, 0.66% after enucleation and 1.2% after Ablation. The incidence of BNS was higher after TURP than after Enucleation but the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.75 95% CI 0.81-3.79, p = 0.16). There was no significant heterogeneity among the studies (I2 0%, Chi2 4.11, p = 0.90). The incidence of BNS was higher after TURP than after Ablation, but the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.82-2.11, p = 0.26) with no significant heterogeneity (I2 0%, Chi2 21.1, p = 0.51).

We discuss the economic, socio-cultural, and environmental effects of shuttering the tournament and suggest that an understanding of the impacts of COVID-19 offers an opportunity to bring about an alternative, more sustainable sports tourism economy. The cancellation of March Madness resulted in the loss of millions of dollars in tourism revenue for local economies and deprived traveler-fans of pilgrimages to arenas, important socio-cultural gathering spaces for American basketball fans. However, it also prevented the emission of a sizable quantity of greenhouse gasses based on our carbon footprint calculated from the previous year’s tournament. Ultimately, from the disruptive closing down of sport and event tourism, a post-pandemic sports tourism landscape should emerge that takes more seriously the triple-bottom line notion of balancing a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with the creation and maintenance of resilient local economies all while both acknowledging the important role sport plays in society and keeping tourism actors healthy.","Cooper, J.

In this study, 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens infected with TW I-type IBV were continuously observed for 200 days. TW I-type IBV affected the respiratory, urinary, and female reproductive systems, resulting in a mortality rate of 10% as well as a decrease in egg quantity and an increase in inferior eggs. During the monitoring period, serious lesions occurred in the female reproductive system, such as yolk peritonitis, a shortened oviduct, and cysts of different sizes with effusion in the degenerated right oviduct. The infective viruses persisted in vivo for a long time, and due to the stress of laying, virus shedding was detected again after the onset of egg production. Our findings suggest that TW I-type IBV is deadly to chickens and could cause permanent damage to the oviduct, resulting in the poor laying performance of female survivors and decreasing the breeding value and welfare of the infected flock.","Zhang, Xiaorong; Liao, Kai; Chen, Shuqin; Yan, Kun; Du, Xubin; Zhang, Chengcheng; Guo, Mengjiao; Wu, Yantao",Vet Res,90,1

A scoping review was undertaken, including 35 articles published in English. Two pairs of independent researchers synthesized the data. RESULTS: Most studies were case studies or case series and had a low risk of bias. A predominance of cases was found in women over the age of 30 years who got infected in the third term of pregnancy and who had comorbidities. The prematurity index varied with the heterogeneity of the samples, and the cases of abortion occurred in combination with severe forms of infection. Caesarean section deliveries predominated, indicated mainly by respiratory decompensation caused by infection. Most women were discharged.

In the early phase, many countries employed manual contact tracing to contain the rate of disease spread, however it has many issues. The manual approach is cumbersome, time consuming and also requires active participation of a large number of people to realize it. In order to overcome these drawbacks, digital contact tracing has been proposed that typically involves deploying a contact tracing application on people's mobile devices which can track their movements and close social interactions. While studies suggest that digital contact tracing is more effective than manual contact tracing, it has been observed that higher adoption rates of the contact tracing app may result in a better controlled epidemic. This also increases the confidence in the accuracy of the collected data and the subsequent analytics. One key reason for low adoption rate of contact tracing applications is the concern about individual privacy. In fact, several studies report that contact tracing applications deployed in multiple countries are not privacy friendly and have potential to be used for mass surveillance by the concerned governments. Hence, privacy respecting contact tracing application is the need of the hour that can lead to highly effective, efficient contact tracing. As part of this study, we focus on various cryptographic techniques that can help in addressing the Private Set Intersection problem which lies at the heart of privacy respecting contact tracing. We analyze the computation and communication complexities of these techniques under the typical client-server architecture utilized by contact tracing applications. Further we evaluate those computation and communication complexity expressions for India scenario and thus identify cryptographic techniques that can be more suitably deployed there.","RajanM, A; Shukla, Manish; Lodha, Sachin",,90,16

This article extends the transportation literature regarding community responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and what lessons can be obtained from the case of Hong Kong in 2020. Individual behavior and collective responsibility are considered crucial to ensure both personal and community wellbeing in a pandemic context. Trends in government policies, the number of infectious cases, and community mobility are examined using multiple data sources. The mobility changes that occurred during the state of emergency are revealed by a time-series analysis of variables that measure both the epidemiological severity level and government stringency. The results demonstrate a high response capability of the local government, inhabitants, and communities. Communities in Hong Kong are found to have reacted faster than the implementation of health interventions, whereas the government policies effectively reduced the number of infection cases. The ways in which community action are vital to empower flexible and adaptive community responses are also explored. The results indicate that voluntary community involvement constitutes a necessary condition to help inform and reshape future transport policy and response strategies to mitigate the pandemic.","Chan, Ho-Yin; Chen, Anthony; Ma, Wei; Sze, Nang-Ngai; Liu, Xintao",,90,1

Knowledge of possible symptoms and their distribution allows for the early identification of infected patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the distribution pattern of COVID-19 symptoms as well as possible unreported symptoms, we created an app-based self-reporting tool. METHODS: The COVID-19 Symptom Tracker is an app-based daily self-reporting tool. Between April 8 and May 15, 2020, a total of 22,327 individuals installed this app on their mobile device. An initial questionnaire asked for demographic information (age, gender, postal code) and past medical history comprising relevant chronic diseases. The participants were reminded daily to report whether they were experiencing any symptoms and if they had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants who sought health care services were asked additional questions regarding diagnostics and treatment. Participation was open to all adults (&#8805;18 years). The study was completely anonymous. RESULTS: In total, 11,829 (52.98%) participants completed the symptom questionnaire at least once. Of these, 291 (2.46%) participants stated that they had undergone an RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) test for SARS-CoV-2; 65 (0.55%) reported a positive test result and 226 (1.91%) a negative one. The mean number of reported symptoms among untested participants was 0.81 (SD 1.85). Participants with a positive test result had, on average, 5.63 symptoms (SD 2.82). The most significant risk factors were diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 8.95, 95% CI 3.30-22.37) and chronic heart disease (OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.43-5.69). We identified chills, fever, loss of smell, nausea and vomiting, and shortness of breath as the top five strongest predictors for a COVID-19 infection. The odds ratio for loss of smell was 3.13 (95% CI 1.76-5.58). Nausea and vomiting (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.61-5.00) had been reported as an uncommon symptom previously; however, our data suggest a significant predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported symptom tracking helps to identify novel symptoms of COVID-19 and to estimate the predictive value of certain symptoms. This aids in the development of reliable screening tools. Clinical screening with a high pretest probability allows for the rapid identification of infections and the cost-effective use of testing resources. Based on our results, we suggest that loss of smell and taste be considered cardinal symptoms; we also stress that diabetes is a risk factor for a highly symptomatic course of COVID-19 infection.","Zens, Martin; Brammertz, Arne; Herpich, Juliane; Südkamp, Norbert; Hinterseer, Martin",J Med Internet Res,90,22

Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG-PET) has recently proved to be an important diagnostic tool in this condition since it may highlight brain metabolism abnormalities in a very early stage of the disease. Two main 18F-FDG-PET patterns have been described: the mixed hypermetabolic/hypometabolic and the neurodegenerative one. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is an MRI technique showing brain perfusion, rarely used in autoimmune neurological conditions. The aim of the present study was to study patients with LE with both techniques, in order to compare their results. METHODS: Two patients with LE underwent to 18F-FDG-PET and ASL MRI scans using the pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL) technique. Areas of altered perfusion and metabolism were analyzed by visual inspection, and findings were compared between the two techniques. RESULTS: In the first patient, a relapsing LGI-1 LE, right hippocampal hypermetabolism was detected by 18F-FDG-PET (mixed hypermetabolic/hypometabolic pattern), while ASL MRI showed right hippocampal increased perfusion. In the second patient, a seronegative LE, 18F-FDG-PET scan detected a left hemispheric hypoperfusion (neurodegenerative pattern) and ASL MRI yielded similar results. The two 18F-FDG-PET patterns of altered metabolism were similarly detected by ASL imaging. CONCLUSION: ASL and 18F-FDG-PET findings are strongly concordant in LE. ASL imaging was able to detect the two main 18F-FDG-PET patterns previously described in patients with LE.","Dinoto, Alessandro; Cheli, Marta; Ajcevic, Milos; Dore, Franca; Crisafulli, Carmelo; Ukmar, Maja; Sartori, Arianna; Manganotti, Paolo",Neurol. sci,90,24

We investigated incidence and treatment of AKI in pediatric patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan Children's Hospital during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss possible mechanisms of AKI related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: By extracting data from electronic medical records, we conducted a retrospective observational study of kidney involvement in confirmed pediatric COVID-19 cases in Wuhan Children's Hospital during the coronavirus outbreak, from January 24 to March 20, 2020. Clinical presentations, clinical courses, laboratory findings, and medical interventions are described below. RESULTS: Among 238 confirmed COVID-19 cases, only three were critically ill and needed intensive care unit (ICU) admission. All three developed AKI, but AKI was not detected in any non-critically ill patients outside the ICU. Two of the three patients with AKI had prodromal gastrointestinal symptoms. Significantly elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and complement activation were observed in these patients with AKI. The three patients with AKI were treated with plasma exchange (PE) and continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT), resulting in one complete recovery, one partial recovery, and one mortality due to critical illness. CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill children with COVID-19 may develop AKI, especially following prodromal gastrointestinal symptoms.

This case series collected data from two acute hospitals examining the management of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who subsequently died (n = 36) and compared this with national and local end-of-life audit data for all other deaths. Our results demonstrated a shorter dying phase (38.25 hours vs. 74 hours) and higher rates of syringe driver use (72% vs. 33% in local audits), although with similar average mediation doses. Of note was the significant heterogeneity in the phenotype of deterioration in the dying phase, two distinct patterns emerged, with one group demonstrating severe illness with a short interval between symptom onset and death and another group presenting with a more protracted deterioration. This brief report suggests a spectrum of mode of dying. Overall, the cohort reflects previously described experiences, with increased frailty (median Clinical Frailty Scale score of 5) and extensive comorbidity burden.

RECENT FINDINGS: New data strengthen the evidence against a causal link between MS and vaccination. Recent consensus statements agree on the need to start vaccination early. Timings for vaccine administration should be adjusted to ensure safety and optimize vaccine responses, given the potential interference of DMDs. Patients treated with Ocrelizumab (and potentially other B-cell depleting therapies) are at risk of diminished immunogenicity to vaccines. This has relevant implications for the upcoming vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. SUMMARY: An early assessment and immunization of MS patients allows optimizing vaccine responses and avoiding potential interference with treatment plans. Vaccinations are safe and effective but some specific considerations should be followed when vaccinating before, during, and after receiving immunotherapy. A time-window for vaccination taking into account the kinetics of B cell repopulation could potentially improve vaccine responses.

The COVID-19 pandemic has a major influence on human life, healthcare systems, and the economy. There are a large number of methods available for predicting the incidence of the virus. A complex and non-stationary problem such as the COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by high levels of uncertainty in its behavior during the pandemic time. The fuzzy logic, especially Type-2 Fuzzy Logic, is a robust and capable model to cope with high-order uncertainties associated with non-stationary time-dependent features. The main objective of the current study is to present a novel Deep Interval Type-2 Fuzzy LSTM (DIT2FLSTM) model for prediction of the COVID-19 incidence, including new cases, recovery cases, and mortality rate in both short and long time series. The proposed model was evaluated on real datasets produced by the world health organization (WHO) on top highly risked countries, including the USA, Brazil, Russia, India, Peru, Spain, Italy, Iran, Germany, and the U.K. The results confirm the superiority of the DIT2FLSTM model with an average area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 96% and a 95% confidence interval of [92-97] % in the short-term and long-term. The DIT2FLSTM was applied to a well-known standard benchmark, the Mackey-Glass time-series, to show the robustness and proficiency of the proposed model in uncertain and chaotic time series problems. The results were evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation technique and statistically validated through the t-test method. The proposed DIT2FLSTM model is promising for the prediction of complex problems such as the COVID-19 pandemic and making strategic prevention decisions to save more lives.","Safari, Aref; Hosseini, Rahil; Mazinani, Mahdi",J Biomed Inform,90,16

Currently, the public’s low intention of using recycled water constitutes the biggest obstacle to its popularization. To identify the factors of public acceptance of recycled water and their influence path, this study analyzes the effect mechanism of information disclosure of recycled water on the public’s acceptance of it based on the consciousness-context-behavior theory and by adopting a structural equation model. The results are as follows: (1) The public’s consciousness of water saving, risk perception of recycled water, and consciousness of environmental responsibility can effectively promote public acceptance of recycled water; (2) The consciousness of water saving and that of environmental responsibility have a significant effect on public acceptance of recycled water, and so do the consciousness of water saving and the risk perception of recycled water; and (3) Recycled water information disclosure has the most significant regulatory effect on consciousness and public acceptance.","Hou, Caixia; Fu, Hanliang; Liu, Xiaojun; Wen, Yan",Sustain Cities Soc,90,31

The nearly full-length S1 subunit of the spike gene phylogeny of selected strains, however, split up this grouping, suggesting potential recombination in the S1 gene. In order to clarify this, various bioinformatic analyses of the strains were carried out, which confirmed this supposition. Two patterns of recombination were found among the strains, one of which could also be identified in GenBank-deposited IBV sequences from the region. These findings demonstrate that IBV strains of different recombinant patterns occur simultaneously in the same geographic region and could circulate for an extended period of time, thus contributing to the knowledge on IBV evolution.","Kiss, István; Mató, Tamás; Homonnay, Zalán; Tatár-Kis, Tímea; Palya, Vilmos",Virus Evol,90,16

It has robust historical precedence and sound biological plausibility. Although promising, convalescent plasma has not yet been shown to be safe as a treatment for COVID-19. Methods: Thus, we analyzed key safety metrics after transfusion of ABO-compatible human COVID-19 convalescent plasma in 5,000 hospitalized adults with severe or life threatening COVID-19, with 66% in the intensive care unit, as part of the US FDA Expanded Access Program for COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Results: The incidence of all serious adverse events (SAEs) in the first four hours after transfusion was <1%, including mortality rate (0.3%). Of the 36 reported SAEs, there were 25 reported incidences of related SAEs, including mortality (n=4), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO; n=7), transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI; n=11), and severe allergic transfusion reactions (n=3). However, only 2 (of 36) SAEs were judged as definitely related to the convalescent plasma transfusion by the treating physician. The seven-day mortality rate was 14.9%. Conclusion: Given the deadly nature of COVID-19 and the large population of critically-ill patients included in these analyses, the mortality rate does not appear excessive. These early indicators suggest that transfusion of convalescent plasma is safe in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Joyner, M.; Wright, R.

METHODS: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted among patients with post COVID-19 anosmia. One hundred patients were randomly assigned to two groups; group I included 50 patients received mometasone furoate nasal spray in an appropriate dose of 2 puff (100 μg) once daily in each nostril for 3 weeks with olfactory training, group II included 50 patients were advised to keep on olfactory training only. The assessment of smell was done using (Visual Analog Scale from 0 to 10). All patients were initially evaluated after their recovery from COVID-19 and followed up for 3 weeks. The smell scores were recorded weekly and the duration of smell loss was recorded from the onset of anosmia till the full recovery. RESULTS: In both groups, the smell scores significantly improved by the end of the third week (P < 0.001). By comparing smell scores between both groups after 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks of treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between both groups. In group I, (62%) of patients completely recovered their sense of smell after 3 weeks of treatment, compared to (52%) of patients in group II (P = 0.31). CONCLUSION: The results suggested that using mometasone furoate nasal spray as a topical corticosteroid in the treatment of post COVID-19 anosmia offers no superiority benefits over the olfactory training, regarding smell scores, duration of anosmia, and recovery rates.

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 also has been notable due to its impacts on individuals residing within skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) such as rehabilitation centers and nursing homes. SNF residents tend to possess several risk factors for the most severe outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including advanced age and the presence of multiple comorbidities. Indeed, residents of long-term care facilities represent approximately 40 percent of US SARS-CoV-2 deaths. To assess the prevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among SNF workers, determine the extent of asymptomatic infection by SARS-CoV-2, and provide information on the genomic epidemiology of the virus within these unique care settings, we sampled workers weekly at five SNFs in Colorado using nasopharyngeal swabs, determined the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus among these workers, and sequenced 48 nearly complete genomes. This manuscript reports results from the first five to six weeks of observation. Our data reveal a strikingly high degree of asymptomatic infection, a strong correlation between RNA detection and the presence of infectious virus in NP swabs, persistent RNA in a subset of individuals, and declining incidence over time. Our data suggests that asymptomatic individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to virus transmission within the workplace.","Quicke, Kendra; Gallichotte, Emily; Sexton, Nicole; Young, Michael; Janich, Ashley; Gahm, Gregory; Carlton, Elizabeth J.; Ehrhart, Nicole; Ebel, Gregory D.",medRxiv,90,1

While a number of data-driven and experimental approaches have been suggested in the context of drug repurposing, a platform that systematically integrates available transcriptomic, proteomic and structural data is missing. More importantly, given that SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity is highly age-dependent, it is critical to integrate aging signatures into drug discovery platforms. We here take advantage of large-scale transcriptional drug screens combined with RNA-seq data of the lung epithelium with SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the aging lung. To identify robust druggable protein targets, we propose a principled causal framework that makes use of multiple data modalities. Our analysis highlights the importance of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases as potential targets that intersect the SARS-CoV-2 and aging pathways. By integrating transcriptomic, proteomic and structural data that is available for many diseases, our drug discovery platform is broadly applicable.

Early reports describe high venous thromboembolism (VTE) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) rates, but data are limited. This multicenter retrospective study describes the rate and severity of hemostatic and thrombotic complications of 400 hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients (144 critically ill) primarily receiving standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation. Coagulation and inflammatory parameters were compared between patients with and without coagulation-associated complications. Multivariable logistic models examined the utility of these markers in predicting coagulation-associated complications, critical illness, and death. The radiographically confirmed VTE rate was 4.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9-7.3), and the overall thrombotic complication rate was 9.5% (95% CI, 6.8-12.8). The overall and major bleeding rates were 4.8% (95% CI, 2.9-7.3) and 2.3% (95% CI, 1.0-4.2), respectively. In the critically ill, radiographically confirmed VTE and major bleeding rates were 7.6% (95% CI, 3.9-13.3) and 5.6% (95% CI, 2.4-10.7), respectively. Elevated D-dimer at initial presentation was predictive of coagulation-associated complications during hospitalization (D-dimer >2500 ng/mL, adjusted odds ratio [OR] for thrombosis, 6.79 [95% CI, 2.39-19.30]; adjusted OR for bleeding, 3.56 [95% CI, 1.01-12.66]), critical illness, and death. Additional markers at initial presentation predictive of thrombosis during hospitalization included platelet count >450 × 109/L (adjusted OR, 3.56 [95% CI, 1.27-9.97]), C-reactive protein (CRP) >100 mg/L (adjusted OR, 2.71 [95% CI, 1.26-5.86]), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) >40 mm/h (adjusted OR, 2.64 [95% CI, 1.07-6.51]). ESR, CRP, fibrinogen, ferritin, and procalcitonin were higher in patients with thrombotic complications than in those without. DIC, clinically relevant thrombocytopenia, and reduced fibrinogen were rare and were associated with significant bleeding manifestations. Given the observed bleeding rates, randomized trials are needed to determine any potential benefit of intensified anticoagulant prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients.","Al-Samkari, Hanny; Karp Leaf, Rebecca S.; Dzik, Walter H.; Carlson, Jonathan C.T.; Fogerty, Annemarie E.; Waheed, Anem; Goodarzi, Katayoon; Bendapudi, Pavan K.; Bornikova, Larissa; Gupta, Shruti; Leaf, David E.; Kuter, David J.; Rosovsky, Rachel P.",Blood,90,20

METHODS Study drugs were Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir (fixed-dose combination with Ritonavir) and Interferon-{beta}1a (mainly subcutaneous; initially with Lopinavir, later not). COVID-19 inpatients were randomized equally between whichever study drugs were locally available and open control (up to 5 options: 4 active and local standard-of-care). The intent-to-treat primary analyses are of in-hospital mortality in the 4 pairwise comparisons of each study drug vs its controls (concurrently allocated the same management without that drug, despite availability). Kaplan-Meier 28-day risks are unstratified; log-rank death rate ratios (RRs) are stratified for age and ventilation at entry. RESULTS In 405 hospitals in 30 countries 11,266 adults were randomized, with 2750 allocated Remdesivir, 954 Hydroxychloroquine, 1411 Lopinavir, 651 Interferon plus Lopinavir, 1412 only Interferon, and 4088 no study drug. Compliance was 94-96% midway through treatment, with 2-6% crossover. 1253 deaths were reported (at median day 8, IQR 4-14). Kaplan-Meier 28-day mortality was 12% (39% if already ventilated at randomization, 10% otherwise). Death rate ratios (with 95% CIs and numbers dead/randomized, each drug vs its control) were: Remdesivir RR=0.95 (0.81-1.11, p=0.50; 301/2743 active vs 303/2708 control), Hydroxychloroquine RR=1.19 (0.89-1.59, p=0.23; 104/947 vs 84/906), Lopinavir RR=1.00 (0.79-1.25, p=0.97; 148/1399 vs 146/1372) and Interferon RR=1.16 (0.96-1.39, p=0.11; 243/2050 vs 216/2050). No study drug definitely reduced mortality (in unventilated patients or any other subgroup of entry characteristics), initiation of ventilation or hospitalisation duration. CONCLUSIONS These Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir and Interferon regimens appeared to have little or no effect on hospitalized COVID-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay. The mortality findings contain most of the randomized evidence on Remdesivir and Interferon, and are consistent with meta-analyses of mortality in all major trials. (Funding: WHO.

There is an urgent global need for a universal vaccine to cover all SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains to stop the current COVID-19 pandemic and the threat of an inevitable second wave of coronavirus. Carbon dioxide is safe and superior antimicrobial, which suggests it should be effective against coronaviruses and mutants thereof. Depending on the therapeutic regime, CO(2) could also ameliorate other COVID-19 symptoms as it has also been reported to have antioxidant, anti-inflammation, anti-cytokine effects, and to stimulate the human immune system. Moreover, CO(2) has beneficial effects on respiratory physiology, cardiovascular health, and human nervous systems. This article reviews the rationale of early treatment by inhaling safe doses of warmed humidified CO(2) gas, either alone or as a carrier gas to deliver other inhaled drugs may help save lives by suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infections and excessive inflammatory responses. We suggest testing this somewhat counter-intuitive, but low tech and safe intervention for its suitability as a preventive measure and treatment against COVID-19. Overall, development and evaluation of this therapy now may provide a safe and economical tool for use not only during the current pandemic but also for any future outbreaks of respiratory diseases and related conditions.","El-Betany, Alaa M.

Public health workers might be at similar risk for negative mental health consequences because of the prolonged demand for responding to the pandemic and for implementing an unprecedented vaccination campaign. The extent of mental health conditions among public health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, is uncertain. A 2014 survey estimated that there were nearly 250,000 state and local public health workers in the United States (4). To evaluate mental health conditions among these workers, a nonprobability-based online survey was conducted during March 29-April 16, 2021, to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidal ideation among public health workers in state, tribal, local, and territorial public health departments. Among 26,174 respondents, 53.0% reported symptoms of at least one mental health condition in the preceding 2 weeks, including depression (32.0%), anxiety (30.3%), PTSD (36.8%), or suicidal ideation (8.4%). The highest prevalence of symptoms of a mental health condition was among respondents aged ≤29 years (range = 13.6%-47.4%) and transgender or nonbinary persons (i.e., those who identified as neither male nor female) of all ages (range = 30.4%-65.5%). Public health workers who reported being unable to take time off from work were more likely to report adverse mental health symptoms. Severity of symptoms increased with increasing weekly work hours and percentage of work time dedicated to COVID-19 response activities. Implementing prevention and control practices that eliminate, reduce, and manage factors that cause or contribute to public health workers' poor mental health might improve mental health outcomes during emergencies.","Bryant-Genevier, Jonathan; Rao, Carol Y.; Lopes-Cardozo, Barbara; Kone, Ahoua; Rose, Charles; Thomas, Isabel; Orquiola, Diana; Lynfield, Ruth; Shah, Dhara; Freeman, Lori; Becker, Scott; Williams, Amber; Gould, Deborah W.; Tiesman, Hope; Lloyd, Geremy; Hill, Laura; Byrkit, Ramona",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,90,29

A review of the challenges assessing the clinical efficacy of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2,13.386487,11.218518,2020-10-27,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway senses and responds to nutrient availability, energy sufficiency, stress, hormones and mitogens to modulate protein synthesis. Rapamycin is a bacterial product that can inhibit mTOR via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. mTOR signaling is necessary for the development of influenza and modulates the antibody response to provide cross-protective immunity to lethal infection with influenza virus. In one human study, it was found that the treatment of severe H1N1 influenza‑related pneumonia with rapamycin and steroids improved the outcome. However, in other studies, immunosuppression with systemic steroids, and possibly rapamycin as well, was associated with an increased morbidity/mortality and a prolonged viral replication. In order to avoid the systemic side-effects, some investigators have postulated that the inhalation of rapamycin would be desirable. However, the inhalation of rapamycin, with its well-documented lung toxicity, could be contraindicated. Another class of drug, biguanides, can also inhibit mTOR, but have no lung toxicity. Biguanides are widely used small molecule drugs prescribed as oral anti-diabetics that have exhibited considerable promise in oncology. During the 1971 outbreak of influenza, diabetic patients treated with the biguanides, phenformin and buformin, had a lower incidence of infection than diabetics treated with sulfonylureas or insulin. Both buformin and phenformin reduce the mortality of influenza in mice; phenformin is less effective than buformin. The inhalation of buformin or phenformin for influenza may be an effective novel treatment strategy that would limit the risk of systemic side-effects associated with biguanides due to the low inhaled dose. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a virus closely related to the SARS virus. The disease is the cause of the 2019–2020 coronavirus outbreak. It is primarily spread between individuals via small droplets emitted from infected individuals when breathing or coughing. PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling responses play important roles in MERS-CoV infection and may represent a novel drug target for therapeutic intervention strategies. The present review article discusses the effects of biguanides on influenza and coronavirus.","LEHRER, STEVEN",World Acad Sci J,90,20

METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional, analytical study was carried out in the Autonomous University of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, where a sample of young adult participants (ranging from 18 to 30 years of age) was obtained. They were classified based on the results of body mass index: non-obese, and overweight/obese. The polymorphic variant was determined by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) from the DNA sample and serum leptin levels were measured by Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay. RESULTS: A total of 159 participants were included (non-obese, n=103; overweight/obese, n=56). Leptin levels were 15.14±12.3 ng/mL in the non-obese group and 26.13±19.0 ng/mL in the overweight/obese group (p≤0.001). The allelic frequencies of the Q and R alleles of the LEPR gene in the studied subjects were as follows: non-obese, Q=0.56, R=0.44; overweight/obese, Q=0.62, R=0.38. The relative risk for the Q/Q genotype was 1.18 (Cl 0.53-2.34), for Q/R was 1.14 (Cl 0.59-2.18) and for R/R was 0.59 (Cl 0.23-1.50). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that leptin levels are associated with overweight/obesity in Mexican young adults, but this is not related to the presence of the Q223R polymorphism in the LEPR gene, so the underlying mechanisms for a possible disturbance in leptin signaling in obese Mexican young adults await further studies.","Diéguez-Campa, Carlos E.; Angel-Chávez, Luis I.; Reyes-Ruvalcaba, David; Talavera-Zermeño, María J.; Armendáriz-Cabral, Diego A.; Torres-Muro, Dayanara; Pérez-Neri, Iván",EJIFCC,90,3

The first case of the virus in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was on the 2nd of March, 2020. The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the ambient air quality of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the first time using data from nine cities was determined in this study. Hourly air quality data, based on concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3), and meteorological conditions (atmospheric temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed) of the nine cities studied were obtained from Saudi Arabian General Authority of Meteorology and Environmental Protection (GAMEP) for the period between January 2019 to May 2020. Significant variation (p<0.05) was recorded for the five atmospheric pollutants across the cities before and during the lockdown with lower concentrations during the lockdown except for the concentration of O3 in Tabuk, Al Qasim, and Haql. This can be as a result of NO and O3 reaction, causing the inability of effective O3 depletion. The percentage change in concentration for CO (33.60%) and SO2 (44.16%) was higher in Jeddah and PM10 (91.12%) at Riyadh, while NO2 (44.35%) and O3 (18.98%) was highest in Makkah. However, even though there was a decrease in pollutants concentration during the lockdown, the concentrations for CO, PM10, SO2, NO2, and O3 were still above WHO 24 hours and annual mean limit levels. The COVID- 19 lockdown in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia revealed the possibility of significant atmospheric pollutant reduction by controlling traffic, activities by industries, and environmentally friendly transportation programs such as green commuting programs.","Othman Aljahdali, Mohammed; Bala Alhassan, Abdullahi; Albeladi, Mutaz N.",Saudi J Biol Sci,90,28

However, in pathological conditions, hyperactivation of the cytokine network constitutes the fundamental event in cytokine release syndrome (CRS). During the last few decades, the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and T-cell therapies has rapidly evolved, and CRS can be a serious adverse event related to these treatments. CRS is a set of toxic adverse events that can be observed during infection or following the administration of antibodies for therapeutic purposes and, more recently, during T-cell-engaging therapies. CRS is triggered by on-target effects induced by binding of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells or bispecific antibody to its antigen and by subsequent activation of bystander immune and non-immune cells. CRS is associated with high circulating concentrations of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukins, interferons, tumor necrosis factors, colony-stimulating factors, and transforming growth factors. Recently, considerable developments have been achieved with regard to preventing and controlling CRS, but it remains an unmet clinical need. This review comprehensively summarizes the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and treatment of CRS caused by T-cell-engaging therapies utilized in the treatment of hematological malignancies.","Cosenza, Maria; Sacchi, Stefano; Pozzi, Samantha",Int J Mol Sci,90,1

Neurological involvement could be due to virus-induced brain hypoxia, brain infection, or immune reaction. We aim to describe the neurological presentation of COVID-19 patients and study their neuroimaging findings and disease outcome. METHOD: The study is a single-centre, retrospective, observational study in Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City (SSMC), Abu Dhabi, UAE. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between March and May 2020 who presented with neuropathological features with or without respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 were enrolled. Electronic records were studied for age, sex, duration of hospitalization, detailed neurological presentation, history or documented concomitant fever and respiratory features of COVID-19, inflammatory markers, neuroimaging, progress, and disease outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients of 10 nationalities presented with neurological manifestations. Mean (range) age was 51.4 (21–86) years. Twenty-four had comorbidities, and 18 had no prior or concomitant respiratory symptoms. Ten patients presented with encephalopathy and exhibited altered behavior/sensorium: 7 presented with myositis, 8 with stroke, and 4 with seizures, and 4 had peripheral and cranial nerve involvement. The mean (average) duration of hospital stay was 11.4 days (1-38) with the longest observed in stroke patients. Fifteen patients (45%) died and 3 (9%) had residual weakness. Serum ferritin, CRP, and procalcitonin were higher in the severe disease group and correlated with risk of death. Twelve of 22 brain images showed abnormalities including haemorrhage, infarcts, small vessel ischemia, and oedema. Risk of death was higher in older age but did not differ based on the underlying neuropathology. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients who present with neurological involvement have a higher risk of mortality which is aggravated by older age and higher inflammatory markers. The type of neurological pathology does not seem to influence the risk of mortality.","Deeb, Asma; Kumar, Palat Chirakkara; Sakrani, Nida; Trehan, Ravi Kumar; Papinenei, Vijay Ram",Biomed Res Int,90,30

In this study, we incorporate the following relevant and essential facts. If a seller allows a buyer to pay on credit, it increases sales volume. But if a seller asks a buyer for an advance payment, it decreases sales volume. Sometimes, a seller offers a buyer a price discount for an advance payment to increase sales and profitability. Asking a buyer for an advance payment bears interest earned and has no default risk. If a seller offers a buyer the opportunity to pay on credit, then a longer credit period may mean a higher the sales volume, but the default risk is higher, too. The seller wants to set an optimal selling price, replenishment time, and payment method simultaneously so that the profit per unit time is maximized. To achieve this, we develop and compare the seller’s profit per unit time under each of three payment methods—advance, cash and credit. Through numerical analyses, the following managerial insights are highlighted: (1) Under certain conditions, a specific payment type obtains the seller’s highest profit among all three payment types. (2) If advance payment is required, then it is critically important for a seller to offer a price discount. (3) An advance payment generates more profit than a credit payment provided that sales volume from a credit payment to an advance payment declines insignificantly and vice versa.","Feng, Lin; Skouri, Konstantina; Wang, Wan-Chih; Teng, Jinn-Tsair",Ann Oper Res,90,1

METHODS: Present cross-sectional study included 60 ICU-admitted patients with COVID-19. We recorded data on demographics, anthropometric, and medical history. Serum levels of inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP, IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-6), vitamins (A, B(9), B(12), C, D, E), and minerals (Mg, Zn, Iron) were measured. A Radiologist assessed the severity of lung involvement according to their CT scan. The severity of illness was evaluated with APACHE score, O2 saturation, and body temperature. Independent associations among the serum levels of micronutrients with the severity of the COVID-19 were measured. RESULTS: The median (IQR) of patient age was 53.50 (12.75). Except for vitamin A and Zn, serum levels of other micronutrients were lower than minimum normal. Patients with APACHE score ≥ 25 had higher BMI (p= 0.044), body temperature (0.003), ESR (0.008), CRP (0.003), and had lower O(2) saturation (0.005), serum levels of vitamin D (< 0.001) and Zn (< 0.001), compared to patients with APACHE score < 25. We found that the lower serum levels of vitamin D, Mg, and Zn were significantly and independently associated with higher APACHE scores (p= 0.001, 0.028, and < 0.001, respectively) and higher lung involvement (p= 0.002, 0.045, and < 0.001, respectively).

Our results demonstrated that the two siRNA molecules could simultaneously inhibit the expression of HBs and gp120 by 81% and 89%, respectively. In addition, dual siRNA molecules significantly decreased the production of HBs, and simultaneously inhibited the replication of HBV and HIV. This dual siRNA generation system not only proved to be a novel approach for studying functions of multiple genes simultaneously, but also provides a potential approach for the treatment and prevention of HIV and HBV co-infection.","Wu, Kailang; Mu, Yongxin; Hu, Jing; Lu, Lu; Zhang, Xue; Yang, Yongbo; Li, Yan; Liu, Fang; Song, Degui; Zhu, Ying; Wu, Jianguo",Antiviral Res,90,28

MATERIALS AND METHODS Consecutive patients (n=172) who underwent additional whole-chest CT via a COVID-19 acute abdominal pain CT imaging pathway between 27 March and 3 May 2020 were evaluated in this retrospective single-centre study. Chest CT examinations were graded as non-COVID-19, indeterminate for, or classic/probable for COVID-19. CT examinations in the latter two categories were further divided into one of three anatomical distributions (lung base, limited chest [below carina], whole chest [above carina]) based on location of findings. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results and clinical features of COVID-19 were assessed to determine if COVID-19 was clinically suspected at the time of CT referral. RESULTS Twenty-seven of the 172 (15.7%) patients had CT features potentially indicative of COVID-19 pneumonia, 6/27 (3.5%) demonstrating a classic/probable pattern and 21/27 (12.2%) demonstrating an indeterminate pattern. After correlation with clinical features and RT-PCR 8/172 (4.7%) were defined as COVID-19 positive, of which only 1/172 (0.6%) was clinically unsuspected of COVID-19 at the time of CT referral. All COVID-19 positive cases could be identified on review of the lung base alone. CONCLUSION Whole-chest CT as part of an acute abdominal pain CT imaging pathway has a very low diagnostic yield for the present cohort of patients. All COVID-19-positive patients in the present cohort were identified on review of the lung bases on the abdominal CT and this offers an alternative imaging approach in this patient group.","Hamilton, N.

Thirteen (18.6%) patients had chronic liver disease, two of whom died. The ALT and AST abnormal rates and levels did not increase in patients with chronic liver disease during SARS-CoV-2 shedding. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 does not directly lead to elevations in ALT and AST but may result in elevations in GGT and TBIL; albumin decreased extraordinarily even when SARS-CoV-2 shedding ended.","Zeng, Qing-Lei; Yu, Zu-Jiang; Ji, Fanpu; Li, Guang-Ming; Zhang, Guo-Fan; Xu, Jiang-Hai; Lin, Wan-Bao; Zhang, Guo-Qiang; Li, Guo-Tao; Cui, Guang-Lin; Wang, Fu-Sheng",BMC Infect Dis,90,24

The strategy has not gone through a systematic analysis, however. The present study, Stanford Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) 35 Japan Model Intercomparison project (JMIP), employs five energy-economic and integrated assessment models to evaluate the nationally determined contribution and mid-century strategy of Japan. EMF 35 JMIP conducts a suite of sensitivity analyses on dimensions including emissions constraints, technology availability, and demand projections. The results confirm that Japan needs to deploy all of its mitigation strategies at a substantial scale, including energy efficiency, electricity decarbonization, and end-use electrification. Moreover, they suggest that with the absence of structural changes in the economy, heavy industries will be one of the hardest to decarbonize. Partitioning of the sum of squares based on a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) reconfirms that mitigation strategies, such as energy efficiency and electrification, are fairly robust across models and scenarios, but that the cost metrics are uncertain. There is a wide gap of policy strength and breadth between the current policy instruments and those suggested by the models. Japan should strengthen its climate action in all aspects of society and economy to achieve its long-term target.

There is still uncertainty on whether the recommended quarantine duration is sufficient to reduce the risk of transmission. This study aimed to investigate the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharyngeal, blood, urine, and stool samples of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this hospital-based longitudinal study, 100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were recruited between March 2020 and August 2020 in Guilan Province, north of Iran. Nasopharyngeal, blood, urine, and stool samples were obtained from each participant at the time of hospital admission, upon discharge, 1 week after discharge, and every 2 weeks until all samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. A survival analysis was also performed to identify the duration of viral persistence. RESULTS: The median duration of viral RNA persistence in the nasopharyngeal samples was 8 days from the first positive RT-PCR result upon admission (95% CI 6.91–9.09); the maximum duration of viral shedding was 25 days from admission. Positive blood, urine, and stool RT-PCR results were detected in 24%, 7%, and 6% of the patients, respectively. The median duration of viral persistence in the blood, urine, and stool samples was 7 days (95% CI 6.07–7.93), 6 days (95% CI 4.16–8.41), and 13 days (95% CI 6.96–19.4), respectively. Also, the maximum duration of viral persistence in the blood, urine, and stool samples was 17, 11, and 42 days from admission, respectively. CONCLUSION: According to the present results, immediately after the hospitalized patients were discharged, no evidence of viral genetic materials was found. Therefore, appropriate treatments were selected for the patients at this hospital. However, we recommend further investigations on a larger sample size in multi-center and prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effects of different drugs on the shedding of the virus through body secretions.","Joukar, Farahnaz; Yaghubi Kalurazi, Tofigh; Khoshsorour, Mahmoud; Taramian, Sonbol; Mahfoozi, Lida; Balou, Heydar Ali; Jafarinezhad, Alireza; Pourkazemi, Aydin; Hesni, Ezat; Asgharnezhad, Mehrnaz; Shenagari, Mohammad; Jahanzad, Issa; Naghipour, Mohammadreza; Maroufizadeh, Saman; Mansour-Ghanaei, Fariborz",Virol J,90,29

The strain CHN-JS-2017 was isolated and identified by cytopathology, immunofluorescence assays, transmission electron microscopy, and sequence analysis. A nucleotide sequence alignment showed that the whole genome of CHN-JS-2017 is 97.4%–99.6% identical to other PDCoV strains. The pathogenicity of the CHN-JS-2017 strain was investigated in orally inoculated five-day-old piglets; the piglets developed acute, watery diarrhea, but all recovered and survived. CHN-JS-2017 infection-induced microscopic lesions were observed, and viral antigens were detected mainly by immunohistochemical staining in the small intestine. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) are crucial immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors for the transcytosis ofimmunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, or IgM. Importantly, CHN-JS-2017 infected five-day-old piglets could significantly down-regulate the expression of FcRn, pIgR, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)in the intestinal mucosa. Note that the level of FcRn mRNA in the intestinal mucosa of normal piglets is positively correlated with pIgR and NF-κB. At the same time, the expressions of FcRn, pIgR, and NF-κB mRNA are also positively correlated in infected piglets. These results may help explain the immunological and pathological changes associated with porcine deltacorononirus infection.","Qian, Shaoju; Jia, Xiangchao; Gao, Zitong; Zhang, Weida; Xu, Qingrong; Li, Zili",Viruses,90,1

Recently, cytokine storm by the host immune system has been linked with high viral load, loss of lung function, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, and subsequent fatal outcome. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify potential FDA approved drugs that can be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment using an in-silico analysis. METHODS: In this study, virtual screening of selected FDA approved drugs was performed by targeting the main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2 and the key molecules involved in the ‘Cytokine storm’ in COVID-19 patients. Based on our preliminary screening supported by extensive literature search, we selected FDA approved drugs to target the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) and the key players of cytokine storm, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. These compounds were examined based on systematic docking studies and further validated using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanic/generalized/Born/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/G/P/BSA) free energy calculations. RESULTS: Based on the findings, Rifampicin and Letermovir appeared as the most promising drug showing a very good binding affinity with the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. However, it is pertinent to mention here that our findings need further validation by in vitro analysis and clinical trials. CONCLUSION: This study provides an insight into the drug repurposing approach in which several FDA approved drugs were examined to inhibit COVID-19 infection by targeting the main protease of SARS-COV-2 and the cytokine storm.

Five interdisciplinary case studies addressed zoonotic diseases in African settings: Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Kenya, human African trypanosomiasis in Zambia and Zimbabwe, Lassa fever in Sierra Leone and henipaviruses in Ghana. Each explored how ecological changes and human–ecosystem interactions affect pathogen dynamics and hence the likelihood of zoonotic spillover and transmission, and how socially differentiated peoples’ interactions with ecosystems and animals affect their exposure to disease. Cross-case analysis highlights how these dynamics vary by ecosystem type, across a range from humid forest to semi-arid savannah; the significance of interacting temporal and spatial scales; and the importance of mosaic and patch dynamics. Ecosystem interactions and services central to different people's livelihoods and well-being include pastoralism and agro-pastoralism, commercial and subsistence crop farming, hunting, collecting food, fuelwood and medicines, and cultural practices. There are synergies, but also tensions and trade-offs, between ecosystem changes that benefit livelihoods and affect disease. Understanding these can inform ‘One Health’ approaches towards managing ecosystems in ways that reduce disease risks and burdens.

This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the impact of the shutdown on Danish citizens' leisure PA throughout different stages of life: 15–18, 19–29, 30–59, and 60+ years. Methods: Between April 3 and 15, 2020, while Denmark was shut down, a survey was distributed through online platforms. Danish citizens (>15 years) could participate in the study, answering questions about their PA behavior before, and during the shutdown. Results: The number of total participants was 1,802; 7.9% teens, 21.5% younger adults, 58.7% adults, and 11.9% older adults. Mean minutes of PA decreased 16.1% from before to during the shutdown. Teens had the largest decrease in PA (36.6%) followed by older (24.9%) and younger adults (21.3%). Low educated (31.5%) and those living in rural areas (30.9%) experienced the largest decrease in PA. Main factors for not doing PA during the shutdown were that they missed what they used to do, lacked social support, and did not have access to the right facilities. Conclusions: During the shutdown, the Danish population struggled even more to comply with national PA guidelines compared with before the shutdown. Although social distancing and shutting down sports facilities are important for preventing the spread of the virus, it can have negative consequences for teens' and younger and older adults' opportunities and motivation for PA, leading to an alarming decrease in PA, and, consequently, will have major public health consequences.","Schmidt, Tanja; Pawlowski, Charlotte Skau",Front Sports Act Living,90,26

Our study also aimed to evaluate the clinical use of various methods in diagnosing respiratory infections under field conditions and to describe the antimicrobial resistance profile of the main bacterial pathogen(s) found during the study. METHODS: A total of 20 case herds having finishing pigs showing acute respiratory symptoms and eight control herds showing no clinical signs suggesting of respiratory problems were enrolled in the study. Researchers visited each herd twice, examining and bleeding 20 pigs per herd. In addition, nasal swab samples were taken from 20 pigs and three pigs per case herd were necropsied during the first visit. Serology was used to detect Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antibodies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to investigate the presence of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in serum and SIV in the nasal and lung samples. Pathology and bacteriology, including antimicrobial resistance determination, were performed on lung samples obtained from the field necropsies. RESULTS: According to the pathology and bacteriology of the lung samples, APP and Ascaris suum were the main causes of respiratory outbreaks in 14 and three herds respectively, while the clinical signs in three other herds had a miscellaneous etiology. SIV, APP and PCV2 caused concurrent infections in certain herds but they were detected serologically or with PCR also in control herds, suggesting possible subclinical infections. APP was isolated from 16 (80%) case herds. Marked resistance was observed against tetracycline for APP, some resistance was detected against trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin and penicillin, and no resistance against florfenicol, enrofloxacin, tulathromycin or tiamulin was found. Serology, even from paired serum samples, gave inconclusive results for acute APP infection diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: APP was the most common cause for acute respiratory outbreaks in our study. SIV, A. suum, PCV2 and certain opportunistic bacteria were also detected during the outbreaks; however, viral pathogens appeared less important than bacteria. Necropsies supplemented with microbiology were the most efficient diagnostic methods in characterizing the studied outbreaks.","Haimi-Hakala, Minna; Hälli, Outi; Laurila, Tapio; Raunio-Saarnisto, Mirja; Nokireki, Tiina; Laine, Taina; Nykäsenoja, Suvi; Pelkola, Kirsti; Segales, Joaquim; Sibila, Marina; Oliviero, Claudio; Peltoniemi, Olli; Pelkonen, Sinikka; Heinonen, Mari",Porcine Health Manag,90,20

Five monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were isolated from COVID-19 convalescent individuals and found to cross-react with multiple β-coronavirus spike (S) glycoproteins by targeting the stem helix. One of these mAbs, S2P6, cross-reacts with more than twenty human and animal β-coronavirus S glycoproteins and broadly neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotyped viruses from the sarbecovirus, merbecovirus and embecovirus subgenera. Structural and functional studies delineate the molecular basis of S2P6 cross-reactivity and broad neutralization and indicate that this mAb blocks viral entry by inhibiting membrane fusion. S2P6 protects hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 (including the B.1.351 variant of concern) through direct viral neutralization and Fc-mediated effector functions. Serological and B cell repertoire analyses indicate that antibodies targeting the stem helix are found in some convalescent donors and vaccinees but are predominantly of narrow specificity. Germline reversion of the identified cross-reactive mAbs revealed that their unmutated ancestors are specific for the endemic OC43 or HKU1 viruses and acquired enhanced affinity and breadth through somatic mutations. These data demonstrate that conserved epitopes in the coronavirus fusion machinery can be targeted by protective antibodies and provide a framework for structure-guided design of pan-β-coronavirus vaccines eliciting broad protection.","Pinto, Dora; Sauer, Maximilian M.; Czudnochowski, Nadine; Low, Jun Siong; Tortorici, M.

The host response to SARS-CoV2 has not yet been fully delineated, hampering a precise approach to therapy. To address this, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of gene expression data from the blood, lung, and airway of COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that COVID-19 pathogenesis is driven by populations of myeloid-lineage cells with highly inflammatory but distinct transcriptional signatures in each compartment. The relative absence of cytotoxic cells in the lung suggests a model in which delayed clearance of the virus may permit exaggerated myeloid cell activation that contributes to disease pathogenesis by the production of inflammatory mediators. The gene expression profiles also identify potential therapeutic targets that could be modified with available drugs. The data suggest that transcriptomic profiling can provide an understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in individual patients.

The resources also included reports of World Health Organization, United Nations and resolutions of the World Health Assembly (WHA). Results: African countries continue to struggle in their attempts to build health systems for disease control that are robust enough to tackle the frequent epidemics that plague the continent. The politics of disease control requires the crafting of cooperative partnerships to accommodate the divergent interests of multiple actors. Recent outbreaks of COVID-19 and Ebola had a significant impact on African economies. It is extremely important to prioritize health in the African development agendas. The African Union (AU) should leverage the momentum of the rise of GHD to (i) navigate the politics of global health governance in an interconnected world(ii) develop robust preparedness and disease response strategies to tackle emerging and reemerging disease epidemics in the region (iii) address the linkages between health and broader human security issues driven by climate change-induced food, water, and other insecurities (iv) mobilize resources and capacities to train health officials in the craft of diplomacy. Conclusion: The AU, Regional Economic Communities (RECs), and African Centres for Disease Control should harmonize their plans and strategies and align them towards a common goal that integrates health in African development agendas. The AU must innovatively harness the practice and tools of GHD towards developing the necessary partnerships with relevant actors in the global health arena to achieve the health targets of the Sustainable Development Goals.","Chattu, Vijay Kumar; Knight, W.

Commonly used medications for chronic conditions, e.g., diuretics, antipsychotics disrupt thermoregulation or fluid/electrolyte balance and may sensitive patients to heat. However, the effect of heat-sensitizing medications and their interactions with heatwaves are not well-quantified. We evaluated effects of potentially heat-sensitizing medications in vulnerable older patients. METHODS: US Medicare data were linked at the zip code level to climate data with surface air temperatures for June-August of 2007–2012. Patients were Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65 years with chronic conditions including diabetes, dementia, and cardiovascular, lung, or kidney disease. Exposures were potentially heat-sensitizing medications including diuretics, anticholinergics, antipsychotics, beta blockers, stimulants, and anti-hypertensives. A heatwave was defined as ≥2 days above the 95(th) percentile of historical zip code-specific surface air temperatures. We estimated associations of heat-sensitizing medications and heatwaves with heat-related hospitalization using self-controlled case series analysis. RESULTS: We identified 9,721 patients with at least one chronic condition and heat-related hospitalization; 42.1% of these patients experienced a heatwave. Heatwaves were associated with an increase in heat-related hospitalizations ranging from 21% (95% CI: 7% to 38%) to 33% (95% CI: 14% to 55%) across medication classes. Several drug classes were associated with moderately elevated risk of heat-related hospitalization in the absence of heatwaves, with rate ratios ranging from 1.16 (95% CI: 1.00 to 1.35) to 1.37 (95% CI: 1.14 to 1.66). We did not observe meaningful synergistic interactions between heatwaves and medications. CONCLUSIONS: Older patients with chronic conditions may be at heightened risk for heat-related hospitalization due to the use of heat-sensitizing medications throughout the summer months, even in the absence of heatwaves. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and also to understand the effect of milder and shorter heat exposure.","Layton, J.

Although several medications have been approved for treating moderate-to-severe COVID-19, very few treatment strategy has been established for patients with mild COVID-19 who do not require oxygen administration. Clarithromycin is a macrolide antimicrobial agent that has been widely used for bacterial respiratory infectious diseases. Clarithromycin also acts an immunomodulating drug and suppresses cytokine storms in viral respiratory diseases, including influenza. In this study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of clarithromycin in patients with mild COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an exploratory, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial. This study was initiated in May 2021 and will end in July 2022. Patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia who do not require oxygen administration will be enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to group A (administration of clarithromycin 800 mg/day), group B (administration of clarithromycin 400 mg/day) or group C (standard treatment without clarithromycin). The planned number of enrolled patients is 60 (20 patients × three groups). The primary endpoint is the number of days required to improve the clinical symptoms as measured by the severity score. Secondary endpoints include days for recovery of the body temperature, proportion of patients with oxygen administration, inflammatory cytokines, viral load, serum immunoglobulins, peripheral blood lymphocytes, blood biomarkers and pneumonia infiltrations. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Review Board of Nagasaki University in accordance with the Clinical Trials Act in Japan. The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, the Clinical Trials Act and other current legal regulations in Japan. Written informed consent will be obtained from all the participants. The results of this study will be reported as journal publications.

The continued need for molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 and promise of self-collected saliva as an alternative to nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs for sample acquisition led us to compare saliva to NP swabs in an outpatient setting, without special restrictions to avoid food, drink, smoking, or toothbrushing. Methods. A total of 385 pairs of NP and saliva specimens were obtained, the majority from individuals presenting for initial evaluation, and were tested on two high-sensitivity RT-PCR platforms: the Abbott m2000 and Abbott Alinity m, both with limits of detection (LoD) of 100 copies of viral RNA/mL. Results. Concordance between saliva and NP was excellent overall (Cohen's {kappa}=0.93) for initial as well as followup testing on both platforms, and for specimens treated with guanidinium transport medium as preservative and for untreated saliva ({kappa}=0.88-0.95). Viral loads were on average 16x higher in NP specimens than saliva specimens, suggesting that only the relatively small fraction of outpatients (~8% in this study) who present with very low viral loads (<1,600 copies/mL from NP swabs) would be missed by saliva testing relative to NP testing, for sensitive testing platforms. Special attention was necessary to ensure leak-resistant specimen collection and transport. Conclusions. The advantages of self-collection without additional restrictions will likely outweigh a minor potential decrease in clinical sensitivity in individuals less likely to pose an infectious risk to others for many real-world scenarios, especially for initial testing.","Callahan, C.; Ditelberg, S.; Dutta, S.; Littlehale, N.; Cheng, A.; Kupczewski, K.; McVay, D.; Riedel, S.; Kirby, J.

In this study, we scientifically investigated potent food bioactive broad-spectrum antiviral compounds by targeting Mpro and PLpro proteases of CoVs using in silico and in vitro approaches. The results revealed that phycocyanobilin (PCB) showed potential inhibitor activity against both proteases. PCB had best binding affinity to Mpro and PLpro with IC50 values of 71 μm and 62 μm, respectively. In addition, in silico studies of Mpro and PLpro enzymes of other human and animal CoVs indicated broad spectrum inhibitor activity of the PCB.

While cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, has an extensive antimicrobial spectrum, its ability to affect respiratory viruses has not been studied in detail. OBJECTIVES: Here, we evaluate the ability of CPC to disrupt influenza viruses in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The virucidal activity of CPC was evaluated against susceptible and oseltamivir- resistant strains of influenza viruses. The effective virucidal concentration (EC) of CPC was determined using a hemagglutination assay and tissue culture infective dose assay. The effect of CPC on viral envelope morphology and ultrastructure was evaluated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The ability of influenza virus to develop resistance was evaluated after multiple passaging in sub-inhibitory concentrations of CPC. Finally, the efficacy of CPC in formulation to prevent and treat influenza infection was evaluated using the PR8 murine influenza model. RESULTS: The virucidal effect of CPC occurred within 10 minutes, with mean EC(50) and EC(2log) ranging between 5 to 20 μg/mL, for most strains of influenza tested regardless of type and resistance to oseltamivir. Examinations using TEM showed that CPC disrupted the integrity of the viral envelope and its morphology. Influenza viruses demonstrated no resistance to CPC despite prolonged exposure. Treated mice exhibited significantly increased survival and maintained body weight compared to untreated mice. CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial agent CPC possesses virucidal activity against susceptible and resistant strains of influenza virus by targeting and disrupting the viral envelope. Substantial virucidal activity is seen even at very low concentrations of CPC without development of resistance. Moreover, CPC in formulation reduces influenza-associated mortality and morbidity in vivo.","Popkin, Daniel L.; Zilka, Sarah; Dimaano, Matthew; Fujioka, Hisashi; Rackley, Cristina; Salata, Robert; Griffith, Alexis; Mukherjee, Pranab K.; Ghannoum, Mahmoud A.; Esper, Frank",Pathog Immun,90,12

Preliminary evidence from these patients, as well as past coronavirus epidemics, indicates that those infected suffer from disproportionate complement activation as well as excessive coagulation, leading to thrombotic complications and poor outcome. In non-coronavirus cohorts, evidence has accumulated of an interaction between the complement and coagulation systems, with one amplifying activation of the other. A pressing question is therefore if COVID-19 associated thrombosis could be caused by overactivation of the complement cascade? In this review, we summarize the literature on thrombotic complications in COVID-19, complement activation in coronavirus infections, and the crosstalk between the complement and coagulation systems. We demonstrate how the complement system is able to activate the coagulation cascade and platelets, inhibit fibrinolysis and stimulate endothelial cells. We also describe how these interactions see clinical relevance in several disorders where overactive complement results in a prothrombotic clinical presentation, and how it could be clinically relevant in COVID-19.","Fletcher-Sandersjöö, Alexander; Bellander, Bo-Michael",Thromb Res,90,24

Here three experiments were undertaken to better define the clinical impact of combined PRRSV‐H1N1 infections in conventional and caesarean‐derived colostrum‐deprived (CDCD) pigs. Groups of pigs were inoculated by aerosol with PRRSV followed by H1N1 at 3‐, 7‐ or 14‐day intervals. During the post‐H1N1 period, mean body temperatures, respiratory signs and mean weight gains in the PRRSV‐H1N1 inoculated groups were recorded and compared with those in uninoculated controls (experiments 1 and 2) or in singly virus‐inoculated pigs (experiment 3). In a first experiment with conventional pigs, the PRRSV‐3d‐H1N1 and PRRSV‐7d‐H1N1 infections induced mean body temperatures >40.5°C during 8 days (peaks 41.1 and 41.6°C, respectively) and mean growth reductions of 3.4 and 4.8 kg, respectively, during the 2 weeks after H1N1, along with marked depression and respiratory disease. The PRRSV‐14d‐H1N1 infection, on the contrary, was largely subclinical. In a second experiment with conventional pigs, PRRSV‐3d‐H1N1 and PRRSV‐7d‐H1N1 infections were clinically milder, with smaller increases in mean body temperatures (peak 40.5°C in both groups) and growth reductions (1.4 and 1.6 kg, respectively). In both groups, only one pig showed prominent general and respiratory signs. In a final experiment with CDCD pigs, PRRSV‐7d‐H1N1 infection had minimal effects on mean clinical performances and growth and, except for one pig that was severely affected, differences with the single virus inoculations were negligible. Thus, both the time interval between infections and the sanitary status of pigs can affect the clinical outcome of dual PRRSV‐H1N1 infections. However, factors so far unknown seem to cause large variations in the clinical response between individual pigs.","Van Reeth, K.; Nauwynck, H.; Pensaert, M.",J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health,90,5

This approach can lead to a limited understanding of trust in physicians as trust is based on the relationship, an interaction of both parties: patients and physicians. This study aimed to investigate the factors for trust in physicians among the Koreans by focusing on patients’ traits which are related to their subjective perceptions. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted between August and September 2016 among 1000 Korean adults aged 18 to 59 years. Survey participants were selected by a proportionate quota sampling based on age, sex and place of residence. The t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to examine the difference in trust in physicians among the different groups in each variable of patient characteristics. An ordinal logistic regression model was employed to examine the association between trust in physicians and patient attributes. RESULTS: Negative health-related traits, such as stress and low self-rated health, were likely to lower trust in physicians, and women were less likely to trust physicians. The negative attitudes toward the current health care system were strongly associated with low trust in physicians. Meanwhile, recent experience of hospitalization or outpatient visit was positively associated with trust in physicians, and experience of not being able to use health facilities showed no significant association. These results suggest that trust in physicians is more likely to be lowered by negative perception than by the objective conditions or experience. CONCLUSION: In investigating the factors for trust in physicians, the patients’ predispositions, which make them less likely to trust physicians, should be considered. The attributes of the patients in Korea, which could negatively affect trust in physicians, need to be investigated in consideration of the recent changes in patient-physician relationships and the medical environment in Korea.

Arousal needs were the most common reasons to sext (M = 3.33, SD = 1.89). Generalized ordered logit analyses show that higher arousal needs were linked to higher frequencies of the first three sexting types. Relational affirmation needs were related to the engagement in sexting type two, whereas partner pressure was related to sexting type three and four. Regarding the latter, a significant link was also found with stress regulation. Conditional relations emerged according to adolescents' sex, developmental status, and relationship status.

The WTC Health Program uses a multilayer administrative claims system to process members’ authorized program health benefits. Administrative claims data are primarily generated by clinical providers in New York and New Jersey at the Clinical Centers of Excellence and outside those states by clinical providers in the Nationwide Provider Network. This report describes WTC Health Program trends for selected indicators during 2012–2020. RESULTS: In 2020, a total of 104,223 members were enrolled in the WTC Health Program, of which 73.4% (n = 76,543) were responders and 26.6% (n = 27,680) were survivors. WTC Health Program members are predominantly male (78.5%). The median age of members was 51 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 44−57) in 2012 and 59 years (IQR: 52−66) in 2020. During 2012−2020, enrollment and number of certifications of WTC-related health conditions increased among members, with the greatest changes observed among survivors. Overall, at enrollment, most WTC Health Program members lived in New York (71.7%), New Jersey (9.3%), and Florida (5.7%). In 2020, the total numbers of cancer and noncancer WTC-related certifications among members were 20,612 and 50,611, respectively. Skin cancer, male genital system cancers, and in situ neoplasms (e.g., skin and breast) are the most common WTC-related certified cancer conditions. The most commonly certified noncancer conditions are in the aerodigestive and mental health categories. The average number of WTC-related certified conditions per certified member is 2.7. In 2020, a total of 40,666 WTC Health Program members received annual monitoring and screening examinations (with an annual average per calendar year of 35,245). In 2020, the total number of WTC Health Program members who received treatment was 41,387 (with an annual average per calendar year of 32,458). INTERPRETATION: Since 2011, the WTC Health Program has provided health care for a limited number of 9/11-related health conditions both for responders and survivors of the terrorist attacks. Over the study period, program enrollment and WTC certification increased, particularly among survivors. As the members age, increased use of health services and costs within the WTC Health Program are expected; chronic diseases, comorbidities, and other health-related conditions unrelated to WTC exposures are more common in older populations, which might complicate the clinical management of WTC-related health conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Analysis of administrative claims data in the context of WTC research findings can better clarify the health care use patterns of WTC Health Program members. This information guides programmatic decision-making and might also help guide future disaster preparedness and response health care efforts. Strengthening the WTC Health Program health informatics infrastructure is warranted for timely programmatic and research decision-making.","Azofeifa, Alejandro; Martin, Gayatri R.; Santiago-Colón, Albeliz; Reissman, Dori B.; Howard, John",MMWR Surveill Summ,90,27

This study evaluates the concept of surge capacity, which intends to achieve a balance between the needs and resources in affected areas by providing staff, stuff, structure, and system. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed according to the PRISMA statement and by using PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, and related keywords. Results: There were limited publications about flexible surge capacity (FSC). However, the sum of data obtained indicated the need for flexibility in expanding major incidents or disasters, demanding new resources, which may neither be available on time nor reachable due to infrastructural damage. Conclusion: FSC is a novel concept based on international guidelines. It refers to the extra and adjustable human and material resources that can be mobilized by activating nonprofessional but educated staff and different but accepted facilities in a fast, smooth, and productive way. Public health and public education play an essential role in obtaining such flexibility.","Khorram-Manesh, Amir",Health promotion perspectives,90,16

Its profound consequences have garnered the interest of many studies in various disciplines, including consumer behavior, thereby warranting an effort to review and systematize the literature. Thus, this study systematizes the knowledge generated by 70 COVID-19 and consumer behavior studies in the Scopus database. It employs descriptive analysis, highlighting the importance of using quantitative methods and China and the US as research settings. Co-occurrence analysis further identified various thematic clusters among the studies. The input-process-output consumer behavior model guided the systematic review, covering several psychological characteristics and consumer behaviors. Accordingly, measures adopted by governments, technology, and social media stand out as external factors. However, revised marketing strategies have been oriented toward counteracting various consumer risks. Hence, given that technological and digital formats mark consumer behavior, firms must incorporate digital transformations in their process.","Cruz-Cárdenas, Jorge; Zabelina, Ekaterina; Guadalupe-Lanas, Jorge; Palacio-Fierro, Andrés; Ramos-Galarza, Carlos",Technol Forecast Soc Change,90,33

While the innate immune response serves as the first line of defense, viral clearance requires activation of adaptive immunity, which employs B and T cells to provide sanitizing immunity. SARS-CoV-2 has a potent arsenal of mechanisms used to counter this adaptive immune response through processes, such as T cells depletion and T cell exhaustion. These phenomena are most often observed in severe SARS-CoV-2 patients, pointing towards a link between T cell function and disease severity. Moreover, neutralizing antibody titers and memory B cell responses may be short lived in many SARS-CoV-2 patients, potentially exposing these patients to re-infection. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of B and T cells immune responses and activity in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.","Taefehshokr, Nima; Taefehshokr, Sina; Heit, Bryan",Pathogens,90,33

For most sports there are few recommendations based on scientific evidence for returning to team-game activities following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, the extended duration of lockdown, and self-training or detraining in the COVID-19 environment, and this is especially true for basketball. A post-lockdown return to the basketball court ultimately depends on the teams—coaches, trainers, players, and medical staff. Nevertheless, our current scientific knowledge is evidently insufficient as far as safety and return-to-play timing are concerned. This situation presents a major challenge to basketball competition in terms of organization, prioritization, maintaining physical fitness, and decision-making. While preparing an adequate basketball return program, the players’ health is the major priority. In this article we briefly discuss the topic and propose multiple strategies.","Bourdas, Dimitrios I.; Zacharakis, Emmanouil D.; Travlos, Antonios K.; Souglis, Athanasios",Sports (Basel),90,23

METHODS: Between February 15, 2011 and January 18, 2012, 371 pediatric patients with CAP were enrolled at Beijing Children's Hospital. Sixteen respiratory viruses and two bacteria were detected from tracheal aspirate specimens using commercially available multiplex real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) kits. RESULTS: A single viral pathogen was detected in 35.3% of enrolled patients, multiple viruses in 11.6%, and virus/bacteria coinfection in 17.8%. In contrast, only 6.5% of patients had a single bacterial pathogen and 2.2% were infected with multiple bacteria. The etiological agent was unknown for 26.7% of patients. The most common viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (43.9%), rhinovirus (14.8%), parainﬂuenza virus (9.4%), and adenovirus (8.6%). In patients under three years of age, RSV (44.6%), rhinovirus (12.8%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.9%) were the most frequent pathogens. In children aged 3–7 years, S. pneumoniae (38.9%), RSV (30.6%), Haemophilus inﬂuenzae (19.4%), and adenovirus (19.4%) were most prevalent. Finally in children over seven years, RSV (47.3%), S. pneumoniae (41.9%), and rhinovirus (21.5%) infections were most frequent. CONCLUSIONS: Viral pathogens, specifically RSV, were responsible for the majority of CAP in pediatric patients. However, both S. pneumoniae and H. inﬂuenzae contributed as major causes of disease. Commercially available multiplexing real-time PCR allowed for rapid detection of the etiological agent.","Zhang, Tie-Gang; Li, Ai-Hua; Lyu, Min; Chen, Meng; Huang, Fang; Wu, Jiang",Chronic Dis Transl Med,90,19

Ethnobiology and ethnomedicine-centred research has moved at the (partially artificial and fictitious) interface between nature and culture and has investigated human consumption of wild foods and wild animals, as well as the use of wild animals or their parts for medicinal and other purposes, along with the associated knowledge, skills, practices, and beliefs. Little attention has been paid, however, to the complex interplay of social and cultural reasons behind the increasing pressure on wildlife. The available literature suggest that there are two main drivers that enhance the necessary conditions for infectious diseases to cross the species barrier from wild animals to humans: (1) the encroachment of human activities (e.g., logging, mining, agricultural expansion) into wild areas and forests and consequent ecological disruptions; and, connected to the former, (2) the commodification of wild animals (and natural resources in general) and an expanding demand and market for wild meat and live wild animals, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical areas. In particular, a crucial role may have been played by the bushmeat-euphoria and attached elitist gastronomies and conspicuous consumption phenomena. The COVID-19 pandemic will likely require ethnobiologists to reschedule research agendas and to envision new epistemological trajectories aimed at more effectively mitigating the mismanagement of natural resources that ultimately threats our and other beings’ existence.","Volpato, Gabriele; Fontefrancesco, Michele F.; Gruppuso, Paolo; Zocchi, Dauro M.; Pieroni, Andrea",J Ethnobiol Ethnomed,90,1

To date, a growing number of suicide preventive strategies based on the use of new technologies are emerging. We aimed to provide an overview of the present literature on the use of new technologies in adolescent suicide prevention. Materials and methods: An electronic search was run using the following keywords: Technology OR Technologies OR APP OR Application OR mobile application) AND (Adolescent OR youth OR puberty) AND (Suicid* OR Self-harm OR self-destruction). Inclusion criteria were: English language, published in a peer-reviewed journal, suicide prevention with the use of new technologies among adolescents. Results: Our search strategy yielded a total of 12 studies on the use of telemedicine, 7 on mobile applications, and 3 on language detection. We also found heterogeneity regarding the study design: 3 are randomized controlled trials (RCT), 13 are open-label single group trials, 2 are randomized studies, and 1 is a cross-sectional study. Telemedicine was the most adopted tool, especially web-based approaches. Mobile applications mostly focused on screening of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, and for clinical monitoring through the use of text messages. Although telepsychiatry and mobile applications can provide a fast and safe tool, supporting and preceding a face-to-face clinical assessment, only a few studies demonstrated efficacy in preventing suicide among adolescents through the use of these interventions. Some studies suggested algorithms able to recognize people at risk of suicide from the exploration of the language on social media posts. Conclusions: New technologies were found to be well accepted and tolerated supports for suicide prevention in adolescents. However, to date, few data support the use of such interventions in clinical practice and preventive strategies. Further studies are needed to test their efficacy in suicide prevention among adolescents and young adults.","Forte, Alberto; Sarli, Giuseppe; Polidori, Lorenzo; Lester, David; Pompili, Maurizio",Medicina (Kaunas),90,11

However, the success of the vaccination program will rely on the rates of vaccine acceptance among the population. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the factors that influence vaccine hesitancy and vaccine acceptance, and to explore the unintended consequences of COVID-19 infections. The study will further explore the association between sociodemographic characteristics; health status; COVID-19–related knowledge, attitude, and practices; and its influence on vaccine hesitancy and acceptance among individuals living in urban and rural settings of Chennai, Tamil Nadu in the southern state of India. METHODS: A cross-sectional study will be conducted between January 2021 and January 2023. A sample of approximately 25,000 individuals will be recruited and enrolled using a nonprobability complete enumeration sampling method from 11 selected urban and rural settings of Chennai. The data will be collected at one time point by administering the questionnaire to the eligible study participants. The collected data will be used to assess the rates of vaccine acceptance; hesitancy; and knowledge, attitudes, practices, and beliefs regarding COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Lastly, the study questionnaire will be used to assess the unintended consequences of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: A pilot of 2500 individuals has been conducted to pretest the survey questionnaire. The data collection was initiated on March 1, 2021, and the initial results are planned for publication by June 2021. Descriptive analysis of the gathered data will be performed using SAS v9.1, and reporting of the results will be done at 95% CIs and P=.049. The study will help explore the burden of vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among individuals living in urban and rural settings of Chennai. Further, it will help to examine the variables that influence vaccine acceptance and hesitancy. Lastly, the findings will help to design and develop a user-centered informatics platform that can deliver multimedia-driven health education modules tailored to facilitate vaccine uptake in varied settings. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed study will help in understanding the rate and determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among the population of Chennai. The findings of the study would further facilitate the development of a multifaceted intervention to enhance vaccine acceptance among the population.

Although extensive studies have been carried out to investigate the regulation of interferon (IFN) responses by alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and gammacoronaviruses, little is known about this process during deltacoronavirus infection. In this study, we found that PDCoV infection fails to induce, and even remarkably inhibits, Sendai virus- or poly(I: C)-induced IFN-β production by impeding the activation of transcription factors NF-κB and IRF3. We also found that PDCoV infection significantly suppresses the activation of IFN-β promoter stimulated by IRF3 or its upstream molecules (RIG-I, MDA5, IPS-1, TBK1, IKKε) in the RIG-I signaling pathway, but does not counteract its activation by the constitutively active mutant of IRF3 (IRF3–5D). Taken together, our results demonstrate that PDCoV infection suppresses RIG-I-mediated IFN signaling pathway, providing a better understanding of the PDCoV immune evasion strategy.","Luo, Jingyi; Fang, Liurong; Dong, Nan; Fang, Puxian; Ding, Zhen; Wang, Dang; Chen, Huanchun; Xiao, Shaobo",Virology,90,29

However, social media features, methodologies, and ethical issues are unclear so far because, to our knowledge, there has been no overview of this relatively young field of research. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to provide an evidence map of the different uses of social media for health research purposes, their fields of application, and their analysis methods. METHODS: We followed the scoping review methodologies developed by Arksey and O’Malley and the Joanna Briggs Institute. After developing search strategies based on keywords (eg, social media, health research), comprehensive searches were conducted in the PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science databases. We limited the search strategies to documents written in English and published between January 1, 2005, and April 9, 2020. After removing duplicates, articles were screened at the title and abstract level and at the full text level by two independent reviewers. One reviewer extracted data, which were descriptively analyzed to map the available evidence. RESULTS: After screening 1237 titles and abstracts and 407 full texts, 268 unique papers were included, dating from 2009 to 2020 with an average annual growth rate of 32.71% for the 2009-2019 period. Studies mainly came from the Americas (173/268, 64.6%, including 151 from the United States). Articles used machine learning or data mining techniques (60/268) to analyze the data, discussed opportunities and limitations of the use of social media for research (59/268), assessed the feasibility of recruitment strategies (45/268), or discussed ethical issues (16/268). Communicable (eg, influenza, 40/268) and then chronic (eg, cancer, 24/268) diseases were the two main areas of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Since their early days, social media have been recognized as resources with high potential for health research purposes, yet the field is still suffering from strong heterogeneity in the methodologies used, which prevents the research from being compared and generalized. For the field to be fully recognized as a valid, complementary approach to more traditional health research study designs, there is now a need for more guidance by types of applications of social media for health research, both from a methodological and an ethical perspective.

In cells infected with avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), three proteins of 100, 39, and 35 kDa, respectively, were previously identified as mature cleavage products released from the 1b region of the 1a/1b polyprotein by the 3C-like proteinase. In this report, we show the identification of two more cleavage products of 68 and 58 kDa released from the same region of the polyprotein. In addition, two stable intermediate cleavage products with molecular masses of 160 and 132 kDa, respectively, were identified in IBV-infected cells. The 160-kDa protein was shown to be an intermediate cleavage product covering the 100- and 68-kDa proteins, and the 132-kDa protein to be an intermediate cleavage product covering the 58-, 39-, and 35-kDa proteins. Immunofluorescent staining of IBV-infected cells and cells expressing individual cleavage products showed that the 100-, 68-, and 58-kDa proteins were associated with the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, and the 39- and 35-kDa proteins displayed diffuse distribution patterns.","Xu, H.

The second aim is to suggest minimally invasive treatment alternatives for caries management, minimising the risk of viral cross-infection and offering a safer clinical environment. METHODS: An evidence-based pertinent literature search of different electronic databases was performed in addition to leading global dental authorities, royal colleges, and programmes. RESULTS: All guidelines released in response to COVID-19 centred around minimising Aerosol Generating Procedures (AGP) impacting the provision of regular dental treatment of paediatric patients. There was an emphasis on triaging and only treating emergency and urgent cases. Special attention was given to medically compromised children in the guidelines. Detailed guidelines for the dental environment and equipment were given. This paper also summarised the relevant evidence-based guidelines for the use of non-invasive and minimally invasive caries management techniques. CONCLUSION: Specific recommendations for dental management of paediatric patients during and in the post-COVID-19 era are suggested. Minimisation of AGP procedures, and case-based selection of biological, non-invasive or minimally invasive methods are recommended.","Al-Halabi, M.; Salami, A.; Alnuaimi, E.; Kowash, M.; Hussein, I.",Eur Arch Paediatr Dent,90,0

For the modeling process, the data published by the daily technical report COVID-19 in Mexico from March 19th to September 30th were used. The data published in the month of October were included to carry out the prediction. The results show a satisfactory comparison between the real data and those obtained by both models with a R(2) > 0.999. The Levenberg–Marquardt and BFGS quasi-Newton optimization algorithm were favorable for fitting the coefficients during learning in the ANN model due to their fast and precision, respectively. On the other hand, the Nelder–Mead simplex algorithm fitted the parameters of the Gompertz model faster by minimizing the sum of squares. Therefore, the ANN model better fits the real data using ten coefficients. However, the Gompertz model using three parameters converges in less computational time. In the prediction, the inverse ANN model was solved by a genetic algorithm obtaining the best precision with a maximum error of 2.22% per day, as opposed to the 5.48% of the Gompertz model with respect to the real data reported from November 1st to 15th. Finally, according to the coefficients and parameters obtained from both models with recent data, a total of 109,724 cumulative deaths for the inverse ANN model and 100,482 cumulative deaths for the Gompertz model were predicted for the end of 2020.","Conde-Gutiérrez, R.

Yet the harsh socio-economic consequences of the lockdowns have led many governments to ease the restrictions in favor of less stringent mitigation strategies. In the absence of concrete plans for widespread vaccination, masks remain one of the few tools available to low-income populations to avoid the spread of SARS-CoV-2 for the foreseeable future. Methods We compare mask use data collected through self-reports from phone surveys and direct observations in public spaces from population-representative samples in Ugunja subcounty, a rural setting in Western Kenya. We examine mask use in different situations and compare mask use by gender, age, location, and the riskiness of the activity Findings We assess mask use data from 1,960 phone survey respondents and 9,549 direct observations. While only 12% of people admitted in phone interviews to not wearing a mask in public, 90% of people we observed did not have a mask visible (77.7% difference, 95% CI 0.742, 0.802). Self-reported mask use was significantly higher than observed mask use in all scenarios (i.e. in the village, in the market, on public transportation). Interpretation We find limited compliance with the national government mask mandate in Kenya using directly observed data, but high rates of self-reported mask use. This vast gap suggests that people are aware that mask use is socially desirable, but in practice they do not adopt this behavior. Focusing public policy efforts on improving adoption of mask use via education and behavioral interventions may be needed to improve compliance.

Meanwhile, the RLR signaling pathway is also tightly regulated by host and virus to achieve the immune homeostasis between antiviral responses and virus survival. Here, we found that zebrafish TRIM25 (zbTRIM25) functioned as a positive regulator of RLR signaling pathway during red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) infection. Post-RGNNV infection, zbTRIM25 expression was obviously inhibited and ectopic expression of zbTRIM25 led to enhanced expression of RLR signaling pathway-related genes. Overexpression and knockdown analysis revealed that zbTRIM25 promoted zebrafish RIG-I (zbRIG-I)-mediated IFN signaling and inhibited RGNNV replication. Mechanistically, zbTRIM25 bound to zbRIG-I; in particular, the SPRY domain of zbTRIM25 interacted with the tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (2CARD) and repressor domain (RD) regions of zbRIG-I. zbTRIM25 promoted the K63 polyubiquitination of 2CARD and RD regions of zbRIG-I. Furthermore, zbTRIM25-mediated zbRIG-I activation of IFN production was enhanced by K63-linked ubiquitin, indicating that zbTRIM25-mediated zbRIG-I polyubiquitination was essential for RIG-I-triggered IFN induction. In conclusion, these findings reveal a novel mechanism that zbTRIM25 positively regulates the innate immune response by targeting and promoting the K63-linked polyubiquitination of zbRIG-I.","Jin, Yilin; Jia, Kuntong; Zhang, Wanwan; Xiang, Yangxi; Jia, Peng; Liu, Wei; Yi, Meisheng",Front Immunol,90,30

The prepared tertiary silver-nanocomposite (Ag-NC) was fully characterized via instrumental analysis (UV-vis, FT-IR, XRD, SEM, EDX and TEM) and evaluated for antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities. Ag-NC significantly suppressed growth of tested bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis) as compared with controls. Antifungal activity revealed that the prepared tertiary Ag-NC has a promising antifungal activity towards unicellular (Candida albicans) and multicellular fungi ( Aspergillus niger, A. terreus, A. flavus and A. fumigatus). In same line, both Ag-NC and free Ag-NPs have shown a dose-dependent reduction in Vero cell line with maximum non-toxic dose at 6.25 and 12.5 μg/mL, respectively. Both Ag-NPs and Ag-NC exhibited antiviral effects against Herpes simplex virus, Adenovirus and Coxsackie B virus in a dose-dependent manner. Combined treatment of Ag-NPs incorporated into tertiary nanocomposite based on starch, oxidized cellulose and ethyl cellulose opens new possibilities to be more efficient nanomaterials for preventing microbial growth.

The effectiveness of vaccines in settings with widespread Gamma variant transmission has not been reported. Methods We performed a matched test-negative case-control study to estimate the effectiveness of an inactivated vaccine, CoronaVac, in healthcare workers (HCWs) in Manaus, where the Gamma variant accounted for 86% of genotyped SARS-CoV-2 samples at the peak of its epidemic. We performed an early analysis of effectiveness following administration of at least one vaccine dose and an analysis of effectiveness of the two-dose schedule. The primary outcome was symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Findings For the early at-least-one-dose and two-dose analyses the study population was, respectively, 53,176 and 53,153 HCWs residing in Manaus and aged 18 years or older, with complete information on age, residence, and vaccination status. Among 53,153 HCWs eligible for the two-dose analysis, 47,170 (89%) received at least one dose of CoronaVac and 2,656 individuals (5%) underwent RT-PCR testing from 19 January, 2021 to 13 April, 2021. Of 3,195 RT-PCR tests, 885 (28%) were positive. 393 and 418 case-control pairs were selected for the early and two-dose analyses, respectively, matched on calendar time, age, and neighbourhood. Among those who had received both vaccine doses before the RT-PCR sample collection date, the average time from second dose to sample collection date was 14 days (IQR 7-24). In the early analysis, vaccination with at least one dose was associated with a 0.50-fold reduction (adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE), 49.6%, 95% CI 11.3 to 71.4) in the odds of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during the period 14 days or more after receiving the first dose. However, we estimated low effectiveness (adjusted VE 36.8%, 95% CI -54.9 to 74.2) of the two-dose schedule against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during the period 14 days or more after receiving the second dose. A finding that vaccinated individuals were much more likely to be infected than unvaccinated individuals in the period 0-13 days after first dose (aOR 2.11, 95% CI 1.36-3.27) suggests that unmeasured confounding led to downward bias in the vaccine effectiveness estimate. Interpretation Evidence from this test-negative study of the effectiveness of CoronaVac was mixed, and likely affected by bias in this setting. Administration of at least one vaccine dose showed effectiveness against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in the setting of epidemic Gamma variant transmission. However, the low estimated effectiveness of the two-dose schedule underscores the need to maintain non-pharmaceutical interventions while vaccination campaigns with CoronaVac are being implemented.

The case fatality rate was 7.9%, with a higher proportion of deaths in men than women. The specific standardized mortality ratio was 0.15—0.13 for males and 0.2 for females, showing that mortality is much lower than expected. Cardiovascular diseases, chronic lung diseases and diabetes mellitus showed a significant association with the outcome. Although the case fatality rate in Sardinia in regard to age and gender patterns seems to be similar to that for Italy as a whole, its quantitative value was far lower than the national one and possible explanations might include the genetic characteristics of the Sardinian population or the immediate closure of its borders as soon as the epidemic started.

Methods Data from all patients who were referred to the Vascular Surgery Department of Hubs from 9 March to 28 April 2020 were collected prospectively and analysed. A positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction swab test, or symptoms (fever > 37.5°C, upper respiratory tract symptoms, chest pain, and contact/travel history) associated with interstitial pneumonia on chest computed tomography scan were considered diagnostic of COVID-19 disease. Patient characteristics, operative variables, and in hospital outcomes were compared according to COVID-19 testing. A multivariable model was used to identify independent predictors of in hospital death and MAEs. Results Among 305 included patients, 64 (21%) tested positive for COVID-19 (COVID group) and 241 (79%) did not (non-COVID group). COVID patients presented more frequently with acute limb ischaemia than non-COVID patients (64% vs. 23%; p < .001) and had a significantly higher in hospital mortality (25% vs. 6%; p < .001). Clinical success, MAEs, re-interventions, and pulmonary and renal complications were significantly worse in COVID patients. Independent risk factors for in hospital death were COVID (OR 4.1), medical treatment (OR 7.2), and emergency setting (OR 13.6).

Swabs from hospital surfaces (patient's bed, ward floor, and nursing stations area) and suspended particulate matter in ambient air were collected by a portable air sampler from the medicine ward, intensive care unit, and emergency ward admitting COVID‐19 patients. By performing reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) for E‐gene and RdRp gene, SARS‐CoV‐2 virus was detected from hospital surfaces and particulate matters from the ambient air of various wards collected at 1 and 3‐m distance from active COVID‐19 patients. The presence of the virus in the air beyond a 1‐m distance from the patients and surfaces of the hospital indicates that the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus has the potential to be transmitted by airborne and surface routes from COVID‐19 patients to health‐care workers working in COVID‐19 dedicated hospital. This warrants that precautions against airborne and surface transmission of COVID‐19 in the community should be taken when markets, industries, educational institutions, and so on, reopen for normal activities.","Dubey, Abhishek; Kotnala, Garima; Mandal, Tuhin K.; Sonkar, Subash C.; Singh, Vijay K.; Guru, Sameer A.; Bansal, Aastha; Irungbam, Monica; Husain, Farah; Goswami, Binita; Kotnala, Ravindra K.; Saxena, Sonal; Sharma, Sudhir K.; Saxena, Kirti N.; Sharma, Chhemendra; Kumar, Suresh; Aswal, Dinesh K.; Manchanda, Vikas; Koner, Bidhan C.",J Med Virol,90,1

We present a conceptual model to understand the multiple mechanisms through which the economic and public health crises sparked by COVID-19 might increase food insecurity and contribute to poor health outcomes in the short- and long-term. We hypothesize that, in the short-term, increased food insecurity, household economic disruption, household stress, and interruptions in healthcare will contribute to acute chronic disease complications. However, the impact of the pandemic on food security will linger after social-distancing policies are lifted and the health system stabilizes, resulting in increased risk for chronic disease development, morbidity, and mortality among food-insecure households in the long-term. Research is needed to examine the impact of the pandemic-related increase in food insecurity on short- and long-term chronic health outcomes, and to delineate the underlying causal mechanisms. Such research is critical to inform the development of effective programs and policies to address food insecurity and its downstream health impacts during COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Leddy, Anna M; Weiser, Sheri D; Palar, Kartika; Seligman, Hilary",Am J Clin Nutr,90,16

The distribution of bovine norovirus infections was investigated by both RT-PCR to detect norovirus genomes and a virus-like particles-based ELISA to detect genotype 2 bovine norovirus antibodies. During a 1-year systematic study, a virus prevalence of 7.5% (CI 95%: [3.7; 13.4%]) (10 out of 133 samples) was found in stool samples from diarrhoeic calves screened by RT-PCR. Nucleotide sequencing performed on the polymerase region classified all the norovirus amplicons in the bovine norovirus genotype 2. Rather surprisingly, some rotavirus sequences were also detected. On the basis of the polymerase region, genotype 1 bovine norovirus was not identified. Other enteropathogens were found in all samples. By ELISA, a genotype 2 seroprevalence of 93.2% (CI 95%: [90.4; 95.3%]) was found from calves and adult cattle. Antibody levels against genotype 2 bovine noroviruses rose in the first 6 months of life and were maintained in adults. Together the results of virus prevalence and seroprevalence studies suggest that bovine norovirus infection occurs early in life and that re-infection with serologically related bovine noroviruses strains could occur in adult cattle as reported for rotaviruses. The antibody rise against genotype 2 bovine noroviruses in the adult cattle also suggests a short lived and/or strain specific immunity as already shown in human noroviruses. Genotype 2 bovine noroviruses are endemic in the region investigated.","Mauroy, Axel; Scipioni, Alexandra; Mathijs, Elisabeth; Saegerman, Claude; Mast, Jan; Bridger, Janice C.; Ziant, Dominique; Thys, Christine; Thiry, Etienne",Vet Microbiol,90,22

Using the Health Belief Model (HBM) as a framework, this study used a web-based survey to examine how perceived COVID-19 susceptibility and severity and perceived efficacy of recommended health behaviors varied by age group and were related to the adoption of health behaviors. Proportional odds logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between age group and perceived COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, impact, and health behavior efficacy and adoption. Structural equation modeling based on HBM constructs examined the relationships between health beliefs and behaviors. Data from 820 participants (Ontario, Canada) were analyzed (age: 42.7, 16.2 years; 79% women). Middle-aged and older adults reported greater concerns about the personal risk of hospitalization and mortality, economic impact, and social impact of COVID-19 than young adults. Middle-aged adults also reported greatest concern for other age groups. Adoption and perceived efficacy of health behaviors was similar across age groups with few exceptions. Both middle-aged and older-adults were more likely to perceive their own and each other's age groups as responding adequately to COVID-19 compared to young adults. Structural equation modeling indicated perceived benefits of health behaviors were the primary driver of behavior uptake, with socioeconomic factors and perceived severity and susceptibility indirectly associated with uptake through their influence on perceived benefits. Overall, these results suggest adoption of health behaviors is very high with few differences between age groups, despite differences in perceived impact of COVID-19. Public health communications should focus on the benefits of health behaviors to drive adoption.","Bechard, Lauren E.; Bergelt, Maximilian; Neudorf, Bobby; DeSouza, Tamara C.; Middleton, Laura E.",Front Psychol,90,1

STUDY DESIGN: This case-controlled study compared patients diagnosed with and treated for MIS-C at a large urban children’s hospital with patients evaluated for fever at outpatient acute care visits during the peak period of MIS-C. Symptomatology and available objective data were extracted. Comparisons were performed using t-tests with corrections for multiple comparisons, and multivariable logistic regression to obtain odds ratios. RESULTS: We identified 44 patients with MIS-C between April 16 and June 10, 2020. During the same period 181 pediatric patients were evaluated for febrile illnesses in participating outpatient clinics. MIS-C patients reported higher median Tmax (40 degrees C vs 38.9, P < .0001), and increased frequency of abdominal pain (OR 12.5, 95% CI [1.65-33.24]), neck pain (536.5, [2.23-129,029]), conjunctivitis (31.3, [4.6-212.8]), oral mucosal irritation (11.8, [1.4-99.4]), extremity swelling or rash (99.9, [5-1960]) and generalized rash (7.42, [1.6-33.2]).

This condition is generally referred to as pulmonary edema and is a direct consequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. There are multiple potential mechanisms leading to pulmonary edema in severe Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) patients and understanding of those mechanisms may enable proper management of this condition. Here, we provide a perspective on abnormal lung humoral metabolism of pulmonary edema in COVID-19 patients, review the mechanisms by which pulmonary edema may be induced in COVID-19 patients, and propose putative drug targets that may be of use in treating COVID-19. Among the currently pursued therapeutic strategies against COVID-19, little attention has been paid to abnormal lung humoral metabolism. Perplexingly, successful balance of lung humoral metabolism may lead to the reduction of the number of COVID-19 death limiting the possibility of healthcare services with insufficient capacity to provide ventilator-assisted respiration.","Cui, Xinyu; Chen, Wuyue; Zhou, Haoyan; Gong, Yuan; Zhu, Bowen; Lv, Xiang; Guo, Hongbo; Duan, Jinao; Zhou, Jing; Marcon, Edyta; Ma, Hongyue",Front Pharmacol,90,3

Even though, there is a limited testing capacity in Africa the number of cases and deaths is progressively increased. This catastrophic case has a great impact in Africa unless preventive measures are effectively undertaken. In Ethiopia, the number of COVID-19 cases and death are increasing over time. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the level of community readiness for COVID-19 pandemic prevention and its associated factors in residents of Awi Zone, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted among 1524 study participants from July 28 to August 27, 2020. Data were collected using structured and pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaires. The collected data were entered into EPI data 4.6 versions and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 24.0. Those variables with P-value<0.25 were entered into multivariable analyses and those variables with P-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Finally, the findings of the result were explained using texts, figures, and tables. RESULTS: A total of 1423 participants have participated in the study. The finding revealed that the prevalence of knowledge, attitude, perception, and practice towards COVID-19 were found to be 76.6%, 68.4%, 68.5%, and 29% respectively. In final model, being a female [AOR=1.388 (95% CI: 1.050–1.834) P= 0.021], married respondents [AOR=3.116 (95% CI: 1.592–6.099) P= 0.001], Muslim religion followers [AOR=2.392 (95% CI:1.503–3.806) P=0.002], and able to read and write [AOR=1.986 (95% CI:1.311–3.006) P=0.002] were some of the variables significantly associated with the level of community readiness towards COVID-19 preventive measures. CONCLUSION: The study findings indicate that respondent’s level of community readiness for COVID-19 prevention was mainly affected by sex, marital status, religion, and educational status. The Health education programs aimed at mobilizing and improving COVID-19 related level of community readiness especially practice are urgently needed. Awareness creation programs on more targeted groups such as men, unmarried and those with low educational level and religious leaders should be teaching the believers by interacting with faith and science on the means of preventing the pandemic.","Adane, Daniel; Yeshaneh, Alex; Wassihun, Biresaw; Gasheneit, Addisu",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,90,22

This has implicated the eye as a portal of transmission. The aim of this systemic review is to summarise and discuss the current literature regarding ocular involvement of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: In this systematic review, the prevalence of ocular symptoms and signs was low (from 0 to 31.58%) and conjunctivitis was a relatively rare occurrence. The rate of detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the ocular swab samples was low as well and this ranged from 0 to 11.11%. The development of ocular symptoms and signs was not always accompanied by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the ocular swab samples. The opposite was described as well. This may reflect issues related to the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and of the study design. Nonetheless, the nature of research in a pandemic is that conclusions can change as more information is obtained. SUMMARY: Whilst the eye is unlikely to be a main transmission route, we need to consider the possibilities of conjunctivitis as a presenting complaint and of the eye playing a role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we need to take the appropriate precautions in our practice. Further studies are needed to evaluate the viral tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and its role in the eyes.","Cheong, Kai Xiong",Curr Ophthalmol Rep,90,1

Well-established measures, such as social distancing, testing, contact tracing, improved hygiene, and generalized use of personal protective equipment, are almost impossible to implement. We specifically investigated the impact of adapting these measures to informal settlements located in regions immersed in protracted conflicts, taking the Northwest region of Syria (NWS) as a case study. Such regions need to contend with the public health challenges resulting from violence, deterioration of health-systems, and political instability. We implemented a stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model to simulate the spread of the virus in high-density camps of Internally Displaced Persons, using a population structure representative of these camps. We chose parameters corresponding to a worst-case scenario where there is no healthcare available. We expanded on previous models to adapt feasible interventions to the living conditions in the camps, including moderate self-distancing, self-isolation of symptomatic individuals, and protection of the most vulnerable in ""safety zones"". All the interventions significantly reduce the probability of observing an outbreak and the death toll. Self-distancing brings the best results if contacts are reduced by 50%, with mortality reduced by up to 35%. A similar reduction in mortality can be achieved by providing 1 self-isolation tent per 200 individuals. Protecting the vulnerable in a safety zone has synergistic effects with previous interventions for the whole population, but is especially beneficial for the vulnerable population. Complementary measures, such as lockdown of the safety zone when a first case is detected in the camp, further reduce mortality and the probability of an outbreak. Our model predicts that a combination of all simulated interventions may reduce mortality by as much as 80%. The time until the number of symptomatic cases peaks is delayed by most of the interventions, in some cases by more than three months. The proportion of the population that recovers, near 70%, could help prevent future outbreaks. Our results highlight the potential of non-medical interventions to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. They demonstrate that interventions shown to be effective in other settings can be adapted to refugee camps and are most effective when implemented in tandem. Our modelization considers complementary measures to these interventions that can be implemented autonomously by these communities, such as buffer zones, daily health-checks, and carers for isolated individuals, quantifying their impact on the micro-dynamics of disease transmission. Similar measures may be applicable to controlling COVID-19 in other informal settlements, particularly Internally Displaced Persons camps in conflict regions, around the world.","Pascual-Garcia, A.; Klein, J.; Villers, J.; Campillo-Funollet, E.; Sarkis, C.",,90,1

Many viruses utilize RNA helicases in their life cycle, while human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) does not encode an RNA helicase. Thus, host RNA helicase has been involved in HIV-1 replication. Indeed, DDX1 and DDX3 DEAD-box RNA helicases are known to be required for efficient HIV-1 Rev-dependent RNA export. However, it remains unclear whether distinct DDX RNA helicases cross-talk and cooperate to modulate the HIV-1 Rev function. In this study, we noticed that distinct DDX RNA helicases, including DDX1, DDX3, DDX5, DDX17, DDX21, DDX56, except DDX6, bound to the Rev protein and they colocalized with Rev in nucleolus or nucleus. In this context, these DEAD-box RNA helicases except DDX6 markedly enhanced the HIV-1 Rev-dependent RNA export. Furthermore, DDX3 interacted with DDX5 and synergistically enhanced the Rev function. As well, combination of other distinct DDX RNA helicases cooperated to stimulate the Rev function. Altogether, these results suggest that distinct DDX DEAD-box RNA helicases cooperate to modulate the HIV-1 Rev function.","Yasuda-Inoue, Mariko; Kuroki, Misao; Ariumi, Yasuo",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,90,3

Nonetheless, the recent and continuous development of new single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) toolkits has enabled researchers to compare transcriptomes at a single-cell resolution, thus facilitating the analysis of individual cellular features and a deeper understanding of cellular functions. Nonetheless, the rapid evolution of high throughput single-cell “omics” tools has created the need for effective hypothesis verification strategies. Particularly, this issue could be addressed by coupling cell engineering techniques with single-cell sequencing.

Moreover, as smoking increases the blood circulatory level of VWF and decreases the levels of thrombomodulin, it can lead to dysregulated blood homeostasis and hence, increased risk of thrombosis which significantly increases the risk of stroke and cardiovascular disorders. However, despite current controversies and remarkable study limitations, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis claims that the findings of 18 recent COVID-19 clinical and epidemiological studies show that smokers were statistically less likely to be hospitalized. The authors state that their observations might be due to the effects of nicotine. We believe that the lower number of hospitalized smokers than expected, if confirmed by further studies, can be due to the higher concentration of deposited energy of alpha particles emitted from radionuclides such as Po-210 in cigarette tobacco. The anti-inflammatory effects of localized radiation energy deposition of alpha particles as well as the effect of low doses of radiation on reducing the risk of thrombosis, are possibly involved in the lower number of hospitalized smokers than expected.","J.

Demographic variables, existence of systemic or neurological comorbidities, the form of onset of the infection, alteration in complementary studies and the degree of severity of neurological symptoms were recorded. Results: 817 patients from all over the country were included, 52% male, mean age 38 years, most of them without comorbidities or previous neurological pathology. The first symptom of the infection was neurological in 56.2% of the cases, predominantly headache (69%), then anosmia / ageusia (66%). Myalgias (52%), allodynia / hyperalgesia (18%), and asthenia (6%) were also reported. 3.2% showed diffuse CNS involvement such as encephalopathy or seizures. 1.7% had cerebrovascular complications. Sleep disorders were observed in 3.2%. 6 patients were reported with Guillain Barre (GBS), peripheral neuropathy (3.4%), tongue paresthesia (0.6%), hearing loss (0.4%), plexopathy (0.3%). The severity of neurological symptoms was correlated with age and the existence of comorbidities. Conclusions: Our results, similar to those of other countries, show two types of neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19: some potentially disabling or fatal such as GBS or encephalitis, and others less devastating, but more frequent such as headache or anosmia that demand increasingly long-term care.","Bendersky, M.; Alessandro, L.; Appiani, F.; Borrego Guerrero, B.; Cairola, P.; Calandri, I.; Cardozo Oliver, J.

A wide range of digital games is being also developed with VRTs and together with their components, the games' structural elements are appealing to children and engaging them more in virtual worlds. Our research interest is directed towards children's development and the effects of VRTs within gaming environments. Contemporary psychology studies perceive human development as a holistic and lifelong process with important interrelationships between physical, mental, social and emotional aspects. For the objectives and scope of this work, we examine children development across three domains: physical, cognitive and psychosocial. In this context, the authors review the literature on the impact of VRTs on children, in terms of software and hardware. Since research requires an wide-ranging approach, we study the evidence reported on the brain and neural structure, knowledge, behaviour, pedagogy, academic performance, and wellness. Our main concern is to outline the emerging ethical issues and worries of parents, educators, ophthalmologists, neurologists, psychologists, paediatricians and all relevant scientists, as well as the industry’s views and actions. The systematic review was performed on the databases Scopus, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Google Scholar from 2010 to 2020 and 85 studies were selected. The review concluded that findings remain contradictory especially for the psychosocial domain. Official recommendations from organizations and well-documented researches by academics on child well-being are reassuring if health and safety specifications and particularly the time limit are met.

Interferons of the type I (IFN-I) or type III (IFN-III) families are potent antivirals, but their role in COVID-19 remains debated. Our analysis of gene and protein expression along the respiratory tract shows that IFNs, especially IFN-III, are over-represented in the lower airways of patients with severe COVID-19, while high levels of IFN-III, and to a lesser extent IFN-I, characterize the upper airways of patients with high viral burden but reduced disease risk or severity; also, IFN expression varies with abundance of the cell types that produce them. Our data point to a dynamic process of inter- and intra-family production of IFNs in COVID-19, and suggest that IFNs play opposing roles at distinct anatomical sites.","Sposito, Benedetta; Broggi, Achille; Pandolfi, Laura; Crotta, Stefania; Ferrarese, Roberto; Sisti, Sofia; Clementi, Nicola; Ambrosi, Alessandro; Liu, Enju; Frangipane, Vanessa; Saracino, Laura; Marongiu, Laura; Facchini, Fabio A; Bottazzi, Andrea; Fossali, Tommaso; Colombo, Riccardo; Clementi, Massimo; Tagliabue, Elena; Pontiroli, Antonio E; Meloni, Federica; Wack, Andreas; Mancini, Nicasio; Zanoni, Ivan",bioRxiv,90,16

Although computed tomography (CT) scans show a variety of signs caused by the viral infection, given a large amount of images, these visual features are difficult and can take a long time to be recognized by radiologists. Artificial intelligence methods for automated classification of COVID-19 on CT scans have been found to be very promising. However, current investigation of pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for COVID-19 diagnosis using CT data is limited. This study presents an investigation on 16 pretrained CNNs for classification of COVID-19 using a large public database of CT scans collected from COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 subjects. The results show that, using only 6 epochs for training, the CNNs achieved very high performance on the classification task. Among the 16 CNNs, DenseNet-201, which is the deepest net, is the best in terms of accuracy, balance between sensitivity and specificity, [Formula: see text] score, and area under curve. Furthermore, the implementation of transfer learning with the direct input of whole image slices and without the use of data augmentation provided better classification rates than the use of data augmentation. Such a finding alleviates the task of data augmentation and manual extraction of regions of interest on CT images, which are adopted by current implementation of deep-learning models for COVID-19 classification.","Pham, Tuan D.",Sci Rep,90,18

Urbanization and globalization have contributed to changing patterns of diet and physical activity, creating an obesogenic environment that increases noncommunicable disease risk, especially in low-income populations. Community-based and technological interventions can play an important role in addressing structural determinants that influence noncommunicable disease burden. The Better Health Programme Malaysia aims to co-create and develop a community-based digital intervention for low-income populations to enable community stakeholders to address obesogenic environments and improve people’s knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to noncommunicable disease risk. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study will assess community member and community health volunteer knowledge, attitudes, and practices on noncommunicable disease prevention, risk factors, and health-seeking behavior in three geographical areas of Kuala Lumpur, each representing a different ethnicity (Malay, Indian, and Chinese). Assessment will take place before and after a 9-month intervention period, comparing intervention areas with matched control geographies. We plan to engage 2880 community members and 45 community health volunteers across the six geographic areas. A digital health needs assessment will inform modification of digital health tools to support project aims. Intervention co-creation will use a discrete choice experiment to identify community preferences among evidence-based intervention options, building from data collected on community knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Community health volunteers will work with local businesses and other stakeholders to effect change in obesogenic environments and NCD risk. The study has been approved by the Malaysian Ministry of Health Medical Research Ethical Committee. DISCUSSION: The Better Health Programme Malaysia anticipates a bottom-up approach that relies on community health volunteers collaborating with local businesses to implement activities that address obesogenic environments and improve community knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to NCD risk. The planned co-creation process will determine which interventions will be most locally relevant, feasible, and needed. The effort aims to empower community members and community health volunteers to drive change that improves their own health and wellbeing. The learnings can be useful nationally and sub-nationally in Malaysia, as well as across similar settings that are working with community stakeholders to reduce noncommunicable disease risk.

Several investigational products (IPs) were used throughout the outbreak but were not conclusive for efficacy results. Only the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) on ZMapp was promising but inconclusive. More recently, during the second-largest Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), four IPs, including one small molecule (Remdesivir), two monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktails (ZMapp and REGN-EB3) and a single mAb (mAb114), were evaluated in an RCT, the Pamoja Tulinde Maisha (PALM) study. Two products (REGN-EB3 and mAb114) demonstrated efficacy as compared to the control arm, ZMapp. There were remarkably few side effects recorded in the trial. The FDA approved both medications in this scientifically sound study, marking a watershed moment in the field of EVD therapy. These products can be produced relatively inexpensively and can be stockpiled. The administration of mAbs in EVD patients appears to be safe and effective, while several critical knowledge gaps remain; the impact of early administration of Ebola-specific mAbs on developing a robust immune response for future Ebola virus exposure is unknown. The viral mutation escape, leading to resistance, presents a potential limitation for single mAb therapy; further improvements need to be explored. Understanding the contribution of Fc-mediated antibody functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of those approved mAbs is still critical. The potential merit of combination therapy and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) need to be demonstrated. Furthermore, the PALM trial has accounted for 30% of mortality despite the administration of specific treatments. The putative role of EBOV soluble Glycoprotein (sGP) as a decoy to the immune system, the virus persistence, and relapses might be investigated for treatment failure. The development of pan-filovirus or pan-species mAbs remains essential for protection. The interaction between FDA-approved mAbs and vaccines remains unclear and needs to be investigated. In this review, we summarize the efficacy and safety results of the PALM study and review current research questions for the further development of mAbs in pre-exposure or emergency post-exposure use.","Tshiani Mbaya, Olivier; Mukumbayi, Philippe; Mulangu, Sabue",Front Immunol,90,16

To take full advantage of the resolution of NGS data, we developed HAplotype PHylodynamics PIPEline (HAPHPIPE), an open-source tool for the de novo and reference-based assembly of viral NGS data, with both consensus sequence assembly and a focus on the quantification of intra-host variation through haplotype reconstruction. We validate and compare the consensus sequence assembly methods of HAPHPIPE to those of two alternative software packages, HyDRA and Geneious, using simulated HIV and empirical HIV, HCV, and SARS-CoV-2 datasets. Our validation methods included read mapping, genetic distance, and genetic diversity metrics. In simulated NGS data, HAPHPIPE generated pol consensus sequences significantly closer to the true consensus sequence than those produced by HyDRA and Geneious and performed comparably to Geneious for HIV gp120 sequences. Furthermore, using empirical data from multiple viruses, we demonstrate that HAPHPIPE can analyze larger sequence datasets due to its greater computational speed. Therefore, we contend that HAPHPIPE provides a more user-friendly platform for users with and without bioinformatics experience to implement current best practices for viral NGS assembly than other currently available options.","Gibson, Keylie M.; Steiner, Margaret C.; Rentia, Uzma; Bendall, Matthew L.; Pérez-Losada, Marcos; Crandall, Keith A.",Viruses,90,12

There is weak evidence on the antiviral and immunomodulating effects of azithromycin, which in addition is not based on results from COVID-19 patients specifically. Therefore, this antibacterial should be considered only as empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), although not all current treatment guidelines are in agreement. After the initial expectations raised by a small trial, more recent evidence has raised serious safety concerns on the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with azithromycin to treat COVID-19 patients, as all these drugs have arrhythmogenic potential. The World Health Organization has not made recommendations suggesting the use of azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine as treatment for COVID-19, but some national organisations have taken a different position, recommending this as first-line treatment.

The pathogen SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the lower respiratory tract and causes fatal pneumonia. Although tremendous efforts have been put into investigating the pathogeny of SARS-CoV-2, the underlying mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with its host is largely unexplored. Here, by comparing the genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and human, we identified five fully conserved elements in SARS-CoV-2 genome, which were termed as “human identical sequences (HIS)”. HIS are also recognized in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV genome. Meanwhile, HIS-SARS-CoV-2 are highly conserved in the primate. Mechanically, HIS-SARS-CoV-2, behaving as virus-derived miRNAs, directly target to the human genomic loci and further interact with host enhancers to activate the expression of adjacent and distant genes, including cytokines gene and angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), a well-known cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), which further increases hyaluronan formation. Noteworthily, hyaluronan level in plasma of COVID-19 patients is tightly correlated with severity and high risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and may act as a predictor for the progression of COVID-19. HIS antagomirs, which downregulate hyaluronan level effectively, and 4-Methylumbelliferone (MU), an inhibitor of hyaluronan synthesis, are potential drugs to relieve the ARDS related ground-glass pattern in lung for COVID-19 treatment. Our results revealed that unprecedented HIS elements of SARS-CoV-2 contribute to the cytokine storm and ARDS in COVID-19 patients. Thus, blocking HIS-involved activating processes or hyaluronan synthesis directly by 4-MU may be effective strategies to alleviate COVID-19 progression.","Li, Wei; Yang, Shuai; Xu, Peng; Zhang, Dapeng; Tong, Ying; Chen, Lu; Jia, Ben; Li, Ang; Ru, Daoping; Zhang, Baolong; Liu, Mengxing; Lian, Cheng; Chen, Cancan; Fu, Weihui; Yuan, Songhua; Ren, Xiaoguang; Liang, Ying; Yang, Zhicong; Li, Wenxuan; Wang, Shaoxuan; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Lu, Hongzhou; Xu, Jianqing; Wang, Hailing; Yu, Wenqiang",bioRxiv,90,26

The characteristics of 56 dairy farms with at least one confirmed case of BNP (thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia and/or typical findings in post-mortem examination and bone marrow histology) were compared with those of two sets of 50 control dairy farms each, with no history of BNP. The first set of 50 control farms was selected randomly from veterinary practices which had never observed a BNP case on the farms they serviced. The second set of 50 control farms was matched by the veterinary practices which had provided case farms. Two separate analyses were conducted: (1) case farms (n = 56) vs. randomly selected control farms (n = 50) and (2) case farms (n = 56) vs. a matched set of control farms (n = 50). All variables with p < 0.2 in the univariable analysis were included in stepwise logistic regression models. In the first analysis, only the use of PregSure(®) BVD vaccine was positively associated with BNP with an odds ratio of 1292 (95% CI: 114–14707). In the second analysis, conditional logistic regression models did not converge, therefore non-conditional logistic regression models were conducted. In the non-conditional analysis five variables remained in the model, three of which were negatively associated with BNP: the use of vitamin E and selenium, the frequent use of mastitis tubes, and the use of stem growth regulators in grain production. The use of prophylactic measures (such as control of parasites or vaccination of calves against respiratory disease) was positively associated with BNP with an odds ratio of 14.3 as well as the use of PregSure(®) BVD vaccine with an odds ratio of 426 (95% CI: 20–9095).","Sauter-Louis, Carola; Carlin, Annette; Friedrich, Annette; Assad, Aryan; Reichmann, Frederike; Rademacher, Günter; Heuer, Cord; Klee, Wolfgang",Prev Vet Med,90,1

However, the validity of such scores in COVID-19 is unknown. METHODS: The North West Collaborative Organisation for Respiratory Research performed a multicentre prospective evaluation of adult patients admitted to the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 during a 2-week period in April 2020. Clinical variables measured as part of usual care at presentation to the hospital were recorded, including the Confusion, Urea, Respiratory Rate, Blood Pressure and Age Above or Below 65 Years (CURB-65), National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) and Quick Sequential (Sepsis-Related) Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) scores. The primary outcome of interest was 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Data were collected for 830 people with COVID-19 admitted across seven hospitals. By 30 days, a total of 300 (36.1%) had died and 142 (17.1%) had been in the intensive care unit. All scores underestimated mortality compared with pre-COVID-19 cohorts, and overall prognostic performance was generally poor. Among the ‘low-risk’ categories (CURB-65 score<2, NEWS2<5 and qSOFA score<2), 30-day mortality was 16.7%, 32.9% and 21.4%, respectively. NEWS2≥5 had a negative predictive value of 98% for early mortality. Multivariable logistic regression identified features of respiratory compromise rather than circulatory collapse as most relevant prognostic variables. CONCLUSION: In the setting of COVID-19, existing prognostic scores underestimated risk. The design of new prognostic tools should focus on features of respiratory compromise rather than circulatory collapse. We provide a baseline set of variables which are relevant to COVID-19 outcomes and may be used as a basis for developing a bespoke COVID-19 prognostication tool.","Bradley, Patrick; Frost, Freddy; Tharmaratnam, Kukatharmini; Wootton, Daniel G",BMJ Open Respir Res,90,5
