19424,Cell-Penetrating Peptides and Transportan,2021-06-29,"RNA viruses typically encode their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) to ensure genome replication and transcription. The closed “right hand” architecture of RdRPs encircles seven conserved structural motifs (A to G) that regulate the polymerization activity. The four palm motifs, arranged in the sequential order A to D, are common to all known template dependent polynucleotide polymerases, with motifs A and C containing the catalytic aspartic acid residues. Exceptions to this design have been reported in members of the Permutotetraviridae and Birnaviridae families of positive single stranded (+ss) and double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses, respectively. In these enzymes, motif C is located upstream of motif A, displaying a permuted C–A–B–D connectivity. Here we study the details of the replication elongation process in the non-canonical RdRP of the Thosea asigna virus (TaV), an insect virus from the Permutatetraviridae family. We report the X-ray structures of three replicative complexes of the TaV polymerase obtained with an RNA template-primer in the absence and in the presence of incoming rNTPs. The structures captured different replication events and allowed to define the critical interactions involved in: (i) the positioning of the acceptor base of the template strand, (ii) the positioning of the 3’-OH group of the primer nucleotide during RNA replication and (iii) the recognition and positioning of the incoming nucleotide. Structural comparisons unveiled a closure of the active site on the RNA template-primer binding, before rNTP entry. This conformational rearrangement that also includes the repositioning of the motif A aspartate for the catalytic reaction to take place is maintained on rNTP and metal ion binding and after nucleotide incorporation, before translocation.","Ferrero, Diego S.; Falqui, Michela; Verdaguer, Nuria",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8310298/,750

32158,Relational Metric Learning with Dual Graph Attention Networks for Social Recommendation,2020-04-17,"2019 has been a landmark year in the world of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), specifically e-cigarette and vaping. Numerous state health departments across the United States have voiced their concerns in the growing number of lung injury cases from e-cigarettes and vaping. Over the past few decades, many agencies have brought into light the harmful effects of smoking cigarettes, and despite popular belief, a growing movement has started to recognize the harmful effects of ENDS. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have released recommendations and provided health practitioners a methodology to identify and diagnose e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). EVALI is a diagnosis of exclusion and comprises a variety of respiratory illnesses, with intubation rates nearing 32%. The most critical risk factor remains product use in the preceding 90 days, although a timeline on the development of symptoms or notable structural changes remains unknown. We present a case of acute lung injury in a traditional cigarette smoker that evolved within hours of switching to e-cigarettes.","Deliwala, Smit; Sundus, Saira; Haykal, Tarek; Theophilus, Nikita; Bachuwa, Ghassan",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7195202/,750

Social distancing rules and cocooning for people aged 70 years and over are now in place in Ireland to slow down the rate of infection and protect vulnerable older people. This letter argues that we need, more than ever, to assert the personhood of people with dementia at this difficult time. That means more person-centred care and practical support structures for family carers to allow them to continue to care at home in a safe and life-enhancing way. New public broadcasting initiatives could create information and communication channels for people with dementia and their carers, as well as demonstrating empathy and solidarity with their predicament. Government, the Department of Health, the HSE and the voluntary sector have risen to the challenge of COVID-19 in all sectors of society. So too have ordinary citizens. Now we need to unite even more to create an unyielding commitment and adherence to the principles of decency, justice and equity in the allocation of scarce health and social care resources.

32172,Dual-Component Deep Domain Adaptation: A New Approach for Cross Project Software Vulnerability Detection,2020-04-17,"This chapter provides an overview of parasites, bacteria, and viruses. Flat worms that may affect a man's health are the trematodes or flukes and the cestodes or “tape-worms.” There are two groups of trematodes—(1) those that are hermaphrodites, and (2) those that are non-hermaphrodites. The chapter discusses how parasites can affect a man's health and it also explains their diagnosis, prevention, and control. A large number of bacteria do not cause disease. Some live in dead organic matter and are called saprophytes. Saprophytes are important in industrial and agricultural microbiology. Saprophytes are responsible, for the ripening of cheese, the fermentation of carbohydrate leading to alcohol production, and the acidification of milk. In nature, bacteria are involved in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles. Thus, decomposition of organic matter is associated with the action of bacteria. Viruses differ from the other obligate intracellular parasites in certain important respects. Viruses are spread from patients, carriers, and healthy individuals who are in the incubation stage of the disease.","Jamison, Jennifer R.",Man Meets Microbes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7195943/,750

A key component of the computation involves finding conserved haplotype blocks, which can be done in linear time. Here, we extend the notion of conserved haplotype blocks to pangenomes, which can store more complex variation than a single reference genome. We define a maximal perfect pangenome haplotype block and give a linear-time, suffix tree based approach to find all such blocks from a set of pangenome haplotypes. We demonstrate the method by applying it to a pangenome built from yeast strains.","Williams, Lucia; Mumey, Brendan",Algorithms for Computational Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197059/,750

Integer Linear Programming is the most widely-used such general-purpose solution method. It is successful in a wide range of problems. However, there are some problems in computational biology where integer linear programming has had only limited success. In this paper, we explore an alternate, general-purpose solution method: SAT-solving, i.e., constructing Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF) that encode a problem instance, and using a SAT-solver to determine if the CNF formula is satisfiable or not. In three hard problems examined, we were very surprised to find the SAT-solving approach was dramatically better than the ILP approach in two problems; and a little slower, but more robust, in the third problem. We also re-examined and confirmed an earlier result on a fourth problem, using current ILP and SAT-solvers. These results should encourage further efforts to exploit SAT-solving in computational biology.","Brown, Hannah; Zuo, Lei; Gusfield, Dan",Algorithms for Computational Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197060/,750
32198,LoPAD: A Local Prediction Approach to Anomaly Detection,2020-04-17,"Gene tree reconstruction is an important problem in phylogenetics. However, gene sequences often lack sufficient information to confidently distinguish between competing gene tree topologies. To overcome this limitation, the best gene tree reconstruction methods use a known species tree topology to guide the reconstruction of the gene tree. While such species-tree-aware gene tree reconstruction methods have been repeatedly shown to result in vastly more accurate gene trees, the most accurate of these methods often have prohibitively high computational costs. In this work, we introduce a highly computationally efficient and robust species-tree-aware method, named TreeSolve, for microbial gene tree reconstruction. TreeSolve works by collapsing weakly supported edges of the input gene tree, resulting in a non-binary gene tree, and then using new algorithms and techniques to optimally resolve the non-binary gene trees with respect to the given species tree in an appropriately and dynamically constrained search space. Using thousands of real and simulated gene trees, we demonstrate that TreeSolve significantly outperforms the best existing species-tree-aware methods for microbes in terms of accuracy, speed, or both. Crucially, TreeSolve also implicitly keeps track of multiple optimal gene tree reconstructions and can compute either a single best estimate of the gene tree or multiple distinct estimates. As we demonstrate, aggregating over multiple gene tree candidates helps distinguish between correct and incorrect parts of an error-corrected gene tree. Thus, TreeSolve not only enables rapid gene tree error-correction for large gene trees without compromising on accuracy, but also enables accounting of inference uncertainty.","Kordi, Misagh; Bansal, Mukul S.",Algorithms for Computational Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197061/,750
32200,Modeling Citation Trajectories of Scientific Papers,2020-04-17,"Gene loss is the obverse of novel gene acquisition by a genome through a variety of evolutionary processes. It serves a number of functional and structural roles, compensating for the energy and material costs of gene complement expansion. A type of gene loss widespread in the lineages of plant genomes is “fractionation” after whole genome doubling or tripling, where one of a pair or triplet of paralogous genes in parallel syntenic contexts is discarded. The detailed syntenic mechanisms of gene loss, especially in fractionation, remain controversial. We focus on the the frequency distribution of gap lengths (number of deleted genes – not nucleotides) within syntenic blocks calculated during the comparison of chromosomes from two genomes. We mathematically characterize s simple model in some detail and show how it is an adequate description neither of the Coffea arabica subgenomes nor its two progenitor genomes. We find that a mixture of two models, a random, one-gene-at-a-time, model and a geometric-length distributed excision for removing a variable number of genes, fits well.","Yu, Zhe; Zheng, Chunfang; Sankoff, David",Algorithms for Computational Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197063/,750
32202,Reliable Aggregation Method for Vector Regression Tasks in Crowdsourcing,2020-04-17,"Compound toxicity prediction is a very challenging and critical task in the drug discovery and design field. Traditionally, cell or animal-based experiments are required to confirm the acute oral toxicity of chemical compounds. However, these methods are often restricted by availability of experimental facilities, long experimentation time, and high cost. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional neural network regression model, named BESTox, to predict the acute oral toxicity ([Formula: see text]) of chemical compounds. This model learns the compositional and chemical properties of compounds from their two-dimensional binary matrices. Each matrix encodes the occurrences of certain atom types, number of bonded hydrogens, atom charge, valence, ring, degree, aromaticity, chirality, and hybridization along the SMILES string of a given compound. In a benchmark experiment using a dataset of 7413 observations (train/test 5931/1482), BESTox achieved a squared correlation coefficient ([Formula: see text]) of 0.619, root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 0.603, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.433. Despite of the use of a shallow model architecture and simple molecular descriptors, our method performs comparably against two recently published models.","Chen, Jiarui; Cheong, Hong-Hin; Siu, Shirley Weng In",Algorithms for Computational Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197065/,750

32205,Secure and Accurate Two-Step Hash Encoding for Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage,2020-04-17,"In comparative genomics, one goal is to find similarities between genomes of different organisms. Comparisons using genome features like genes, gene order, and regulatory sequences are carried out with this purpose in mind. Genome rearrangements are mutational events that affect large extensions of the genome. They are responsible for creating extant species with conserved genes in different positions across genomes. Close species—from an evolutionary point of view—tend to have the same set of genes or share most of them. When we consider gene order to compare two genomes, it is possible to use a parsimony criterion to estimate how close the species are. We are interested in the shortest sequence of genome rearrangements capable of transforming one genome into the other, which is named rearrangement distance. Reversal is one of the most studied genome rearrangements events. This event acts in a segment of the genome, inverting the position and possibly the orientation of genes in it. When the genome has no gene repetition, a common approach is to map it as a permutation such that each element represents a conserved block. When genomes have replicated genes, this mapping is usually performed using strings. The number of replicas depends on the organisms being compared, but in many scenarios, it tends to be small. In this work, we study the reversal distance between genomes with duplicated genes considering that the orientation of genes is unknown. We present three heuristics that use techniques like genetic algorithms and local search. We conduct experiments using a database of simulated genomes and compared our results with other algorithms from the literature.","Siqueira, Gabriel; Brito, Klairton Lima; Dias, Ulisses; Dias, Zanoni",Algorithms for Computational Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197074/,750
32207,Optimized Transformer Models for FAQ Answering,2020-04-17,"Genome Rearrangements affect large stretches of genomes during evolution. One of the most studied genome rearrangement is the transposition, which occurs when a sequence of genes is moved to another position inside the genome. Mathematical models have been used to estimate the evolutionary distance between two different genomes based on genome rearrangements. However, many of these models have focused only on the (order of the) genes of a genome, disregarding other important elements in it. Recently, researchers have shown that considering existing regions between each pair of genes, called intergenic regions, can enhance the distance estimation in realistic data. In this work, we study the transposition distance between two genomes, but we also consider intergenic regions, a problem we name Sorting Permutations by Intergenic Transpositions (SbIT). We show that this problem is NP-hard and propose a 3.5-approximation algorithm for it.","Oliveira, Andre Rodrigues; Jean, Géraldine; Fertin, Guillaume; Brito, Klairton Lima; Dias, Ulisses; Dias, Zanoni",Algorithms for Computational Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197096/,750

The efficacy of the technique was assessed by isolation of 59 wild yeasts from industrial fermentation vessels and conditioning tanks and by matching their ITS amplicon sizes and RFLP profiles with those of the constructed library. Five separate, non‐introduced yeast taxa were putatively identified. These included Pichia species, which were associated with conditioning tanks and Saccharomyces species isolated from fermentation vessels. Strains of the lager yeast S. pastorianus could be reliably identified as belonging to either the Saaz or Frohberg hybrid group by restriction digestion of the ITS amplicon with the enzyme HaeIII.

We focus on implications for local microfinance institutions in Pakistan, a country with a mature microfinance sector, serving a large number of households. The institutions serve populations poorly-served by traditional commercial banks, helping customers invest in microenterprises, save, and maintain liquidity. We report results from ‘rapid response’ phone surveys of about 1,000 microenterprise owners, a survey of about 200 microfinance loan officers, and interviews with regulators and senior representatives of microfinance institutions. We ran these surveys starting about a week after the country went into lockdown to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. We find that, on average, week-on-week sales and household income both fell by about 90%. Households’ primary immediate concern in early April became how to secure food. As a result, 70% of the sample of current microfinance borrowers reported that they could not repay their loans; loan officers anticipated a repayment rate of just 34% in April 2020. We build from the results to argue that COVID-19 represents a crisis for microfinance in low-income communities.

Such user-led foundations are little understood, due to a limited number of published examples. In particular, almost nothing is known about the ecosystems surrounding user-led foundations. Our work seeks to address this gap, through an exploratory qualitative survey of openKONSEQUENZ, from the German energy sector. We find that the technological goals are quite homogeneous, independent of a participant’s role in the ecosystem, but that economic conflicts exist between foundation members and supplier companies due to the consortium’s efforts to transform the software market structure to limit dependency on specific vendors.

When this happens, the group dynamic is influenced. This paper provides a method to analyze an Open Software project to determine the connection between emotional contagion and software production in such an environment, if any. The project change management database is mined to extract change comments in chronological order and by user id. Sentiment analysis is employed to determine affect in the change originating from each userid. File changes are tracked to link them together in the same areas, using a temporal and file locality principle. The correlation between affect and area is then used to prove or disprove whether or not emotional contagion influences open software production. Although in this paper the proposed method is applied to only one project, the method is general and can be reused for experimental validation.","Benedicenti, Luigi",Open Source Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7198246/,750

KAOS goal modelling is a software engineering approach that allows to identify high level goals of an organisation, refine and expand them into lower-level more concrete goals and assign them to specific system agents. The two approaches can be combined, such that the goal modelling is used to derive specific goals rooted in the organisational context, policies and strategies of an organisation. The GQM, in turn, utilises the derived specific goals to produce appropriate and meaningful metrics that can be used to obtain valuable insights and track the state and progress of the formulated goals. Moreover, both models can be presented within a single diagram, thus providing an expressive and concise overview of the systems goals, actors and measurements. The suggested combination is then applied in the context of an open source project, followed by the discussion on potential benefits and drawbacks of using the two approaches.","Askarbekuly, Nursultan; Sadovykh, Andrey; Mazzara, Manuel",Open Source Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7198251/,750

METHODS: Retrospective, single institution review of neonates undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy between 2010 and 2018. Variables recorded included demographics, comorbidities, ventilation status at time of hernia repair, and anesthetic technique. RESULTS: We identified 97 neonates (median corrected gestational age 39.9 weeks, IQR 6.6). The majority (87.6%) received general anesthesia (GA); the remainder received caudal anesthesia (CA). Among the GA subjects, 25.8% remained intubated for at least 6 h after surgery, whereas none of the CA patients required intubation postoperatively (p = 0.03). Two risk factors associated with prolonged postoperative intubation: a history of intubation before surgery (p = 0.04) and a diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Neonates undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy under GA have a greater rate of prolonged postoperative intubation compared with those undergoing CA. A history of previous intubation and bronchopulmonary dysplasia were significant risk factors for prolonged postoperative intubation.","Lamoshi, Abdulraouf; Lerman, Jerrold; Dughayli, Jad; Elberson, Valerie; Towle-Miller, Lorin; Wilding, Gregory E; Rothstein, David H",J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7270742/,750

33822,Possibilistic Estimation of Distributions to Leverage Sparse Data in Machine Learning,2020-05-18,"With the rapid spread of COVID-19 worldwide, the demand for appropriate face masks in the market has also skyrocketed. To ease strain on the supply of masks to the essential healthcare sector, it has become imperative that ordinary people rely more on home-made masks that can be easily put together using commonly available materials, while at the same time performing reasonably at arresting the ingress or egress of airborne droplets. Here, we propose a simple do-it-yourself (DIY) method for preparing a three-layered face mask that deploys two hydrophobic polypropylene nonwoven layers interspaced with a hydrophilic cellulosic cloth. The first hydrophobic layer, facing the user, allows high-momentum droplets (e.g., expelled by a sneeze or cough) to pass through and get absorbed in the next hydrophilic layer, thereby keeping the skin in contact with the mask dry and comfortable. The third (outermost) hydrophobic layer prevents penetration of the liquids from the middle layer to the outside, and also arrests any airborne droplets on its exterior. Simple tests show that our masks perform better in arresting the droplet transmission as compared to surgical masks available in the market.

Main waterborne diseases, mostly affecting developing countries and relevant in terms of water management and changes in land use, such as malaria, schistosomiasis, or cholera, are discussed stressing links to the global water crisis. Also, the role of artificial and natural wetlands in influenza epidemics is treated. The effects of increasing water use and scarcity on human health are discussed considering historical and contemporary incidence of diarrheal diseases in European and South Asian megacities, relationships between dams and on waterborne diseases in Asia and Africa, and intensive agri- and aquaculture resulting in man-made ecotones, fragmented aquatic ecosystems, and pathogen mutations. It is emphasized that the comprehension of the multiple interactions among changes in environmental settings, land use, and human health requires a new synthesis of ecohydrology, biomedical sciences, and water management for surveillance and control of waterborne diseases in basin-based, transboundary health systems. Surveillance systems should monitor changes in water management, ecotones, and hydrological cycles and shifts in, for example, the outbreak timing of strongly seasonal diseases. These indicators would provide criteria for the development of innovative water management policies, combining methods of vector control and the safe creation of water reservoirs, irrigation systems, and wetland habitats.","Lara, R.J.; Islam, M.S.; Yamasaki, S.; Neogi, S.B.; Nair, G.B.",Treatise on Estuarine and Coastal Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7271162/,750

33928,The Necessary and Possible Importance Relation Among Criteria in a 2-Additive Choquet Integral Model,2020-05-15,"This paper argues that the covid-19 coronavirus pandemic of 2019–2020 constituted the first Anthropocenic war: as an anthropogenic virus and biological attack on the human body and as the first global pandemic requiring a truly global response since our recognition of the Anthropocene. The paper explores how each nation was forced by the virus into a pause of global connections and relationships and a war against the human body, with the ‘total demobilization’ and bunkerization of their domestic populations. With space cut-off, this became a war of time and of endurance, with relations reduced, as Virilio suggests, to those of the connected ‘terminal citizen’. Beyond the civil war against the body, however, there was also the civil war within the domestic populations who were active participants in this imploded home front line, producing and sharing both feel-good and disciplinary propaganda and engaging in debates around politics, conspiracy theories and disinformation. The paper explores the problems governments face in remobilization, the new data regime of informational totalitarianism remobilization will help produce and the likely instability of the post-covid-19 international order. It concludes that this ‘war’ was only the beginning and that anthropogenic environmental factors will play an increasing role in human conflicts in coming years.","Merrin, William",Digi War,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7273126/,750

In a previous review, we identified 3370 references reporting on 178 different biomarkers related to sepsis. In the present review, we evaluate the progress in the research of sepsis biomarkers. METHODS: Using the same methodology as in our previous review, we searched the PubMed database from 2009 until September 2019 using the terms “Biomarker” AND “Sepsis.” There were no restrictions by age or language, and all studies, clinical and experimental, were included. RESULTS: We retrieved a total of 5367 new references since our previous review. We identified 258 biomarkers, 80 of which were new compared to our previous list. The majority of biomarkers have been evaluated in fewer than 5 studies, with 81 (31%) being assessed in just a single study. Apart from studies of C-reactive protein (CRP) or procalcitonin (PCT), only 26 biomarkers have been assessed in clinical studies with more than 300 participants. Forty biomarkers have been compared to PCT and/or CRP for their diagnostic value; 9 were shown to have a better diagnostic value for sepsis than either or both of these biomarkers. Forty-four biomarkers have been evaluated for a role in answering a specific clinical question rather than for their general diagnostic or prognostic properties in sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: The number of biomarkers being identified is still increasing although at a slower rate than in the past. Most of the biomarkers have not been well-studied; in particular, the clinical role of these biomarkers needs to be better evaluated.","Pierrakos, Charalampos; Velissaris, Dimitrios; Bisdorff, Max; Marshall, John C.; Vincent, Jean-Louis",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7273821/,750
33942,A Genetic Approach to the Job Shop Scheduling Problem with Interval Uncertainty,2020-05-15,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic forced all urology practices to reconsider the necessity of face-to-face office encounters. Seeking to reduce patient exposure, our urologic oncology office made an immediate transition to telemedicine and this study reports our experience. METHODS: Beginning March 17, 2020 the urologic oncology department committed to see all patients via telemedicine, unless they needed a cystoscopy for high grade urothelial cell carcinoma or recent gross hematuria, or required removal of a Foley catheter or surgical drain. March 17 was assigned day 1, and for the next 14 days rates of face-to-face, audio and audiovisual encounters were recorded. A telephone survey was conducted with all patients who participated in an audiovisual encounter. RESULTS: In analyzing the numbers of face-to-face, audio and audiovisual encounters, after day 5 more patients participated in audiovisual encounters than any other modality. By day 10 no nonessential face-to-face encounter occurred. There was an 80.4% response rate to our survey. Average patient account setup time was 10.5 minutes and 35.1% required assistance from our office to set up their account, averaging 7.1 minutes. No-show rates of face-to-face encounters were significantly higher than for audiovisual encounters (face-to-face 67%, audiovisual 17%, p <0.001). Overall 82% of patients surveyed were likely to elect for a telemedicine encounter over a face-to-face encounter for a routine visit during future flu seasons. CONCLUSIONS: The current study describes the initial adoption, early clinical experience and patient impressions of rapid implementation of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Davis, Clayton; Novak, Mary; Patel, Apexa; Davis, Cordell; Fitzwater, Ryan; Hale, Nathan",Urol Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7273943/,750

This massive inflammatory reaction can contribute to the development of postoperative complications that could topple the state of the system from health to disease, or even to some extent, death. The body, after all, is in a state where majority of its immune cell populations have been depleted, and sometimes needs days or even longer to recuperate. To obtain a deeper understanding on how HIIS responds to complications after cardiac surgery, we perturb the immune system model that we have developed in an earlier work in-silico by adding another source of inflammation triggering moieties (ITMs) hours after surgery in various regimes. A critical transition occurs upon the addition of a critical concentration of ITMs when the insult is sustained for approximately 3 h – a total concentration that corresponds to the fatal concentration of ITMs documented in literature. By perturbing HIIS in-silico with additional sources of ITMs to mimic persistent and recurring episodes of post-surgery complications, we are able to specify under which conditions critical transitions occur in HIIS, as well as pinpoint important blood parameters that exhibit critical transitions in our model. More importantly, by applying early warning signals on the clinical trial data used to calibrate and validate HIIS model, we are able to detect blood parameters that exhibit critical transitions in patients who died post-surgery, where pro-inflammatory cytokines are deemed potential markers for critical transitions.","Presbitero, Alva; Quax, Rick; Krzhizhanovskaya, Valeria V.; Sloot, Peter M.

Studying patient flow in a hospital is particularly fundamental as it demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency of a hospital. Since hospital is a collection of physically nearby services under one administration, its performance and outcome are shaped by the interaction of its discrete components. Coordination of processes at different levels of organizational structure of a hospital can be studied using network analysis. Hence, this article presents a data-driven static and temporal network of departments. Both networks are directed and weighted and constructed using seven years’ (2010–2016) empirical data of 24902 Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) patients. The ties reflect an episode-based transfer of ACS patients from department to department in a hospital. The weight represents the number of patients transferred among departments. As a result, the underlying structure of network of departments that deliver healthcare for ACS patients is described, the main departments and their role in the diagnosis and treatment process of ACS patients are identified, the role of departments over seven years is analyzed and communities of departments are discovered. The results of this study may help hospital administration to effectively organize and manage the coordination of departments based on their significance, strategic positioning and role in the diagnosis and treatment process which, in-turn, nurtures value-based and precision healthcare.","Abuhay, Tesfamariam M.; Nigatie, Yemisrach G.; Metsker, Oleg G.; Yakovlev, Aleksey N.; Kovalchuk, Sergey V.",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7303685/,750

In practice, this assumption is often broken for various reasons. The reported results are then often too optimistic and may lead to wrong conclusions about industrial impact and suitability of proposed techniques. We introduce methods (Supplementary code related to techniques described in this paper is available at: https://github.com/CiscoCTA/nci_eval) focusing on evaluation under non-constant class imbalance. We show that not only the absolute values of commonly used metrics, but even the order of classifiers in relation to the evaluation metric used is affected by the change of the imbalance rate. Finally, we demonstrate that using subsampling in order to get a test dataset with class imbalance equal to the one observed in the wild is not necessary, and eventually can lead to significant errors in classifier’s performance estimate.","Brabec, Jan; Komárek, Tomáš; Franc, Vojtěch; Machlica, Lukáš",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7303692/,750

Hence, it is crucial to take measure against such a distressing phenomenon since it can turn into a crisis by itself. In this work, the automatic rumour detection in natural disasters is addressed from an imbalanced learning perspective due to the rumour dearth versus non-rumour abundance in social networks. We first provide two datasets by collecting and annotating tweets regarding the Hurricane Florence and Kerala flood. We then capture the properties of rumours and non-rumours in those disasters using 83 theory-based and early-available features, 47 of which are proposed for the first time. The proposed features show a high discrimination power that help us distinguish rumours from non-rumours more reliably. Next, We build the rumour identification models using imbalanced learning to address the scarcity of rumours compared to non-rumour. Additionally, to replicate the rumour detection in the real-world situation, we practice cross-incident learning by training the classifier with the samples of one incident and test it with the other one. In the end we measure the impact of imbalanced learning using Bayesian Wilcoxon Signed-rank test and observe a significant improvement in the classifiers performance.","Fard, Amir Ebrahimi; Mohammadi, Majid; de Walle, Bartel van",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7303702/,750
35698,Synthesis for Multi-weighted Games with Branching-Time Winning Conditions,2020-06-02,"BACKGROUND: Continuous monitoring of SpO(2) in the neonatal ICU is the standard of care. Changes in SpO(2) exposure have been shown to markedly impact outcome, but limiting extreme episodes is an arduous task. Much more complicated than setting alarm policy, it is fraught with balancing alarm fatigue and compliance. Information on optimum strategies is limited. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study intended to describe the relative chance of normoxemia, and risks of hypoxemia and hyperoxemia at relevant SpO(2) levels in the neonatal ICU. The data, paired SpO(2)-PaO(2) and post-menstrual age, are from a single tertiary care unit. They reflect all infants receiving supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation during a 3-year period. The primary measures were the chance of normoxemia (PaO(2) 50–80 mmHg), risks of severe hypoxemia (PaO(2) ≤ 40 mmHg), and of severe hyperoxemia (PaO(2) ≥ 100 mmHg) at relevant SpO(2) levels. RESULTS: Neonates were categorized by postmenstrual age: < 33 (n = 155), 33–36 (n = 192) and > 36 (n = 1031) weeks. From these infants, 26,162 SpO(2)-PaO(2) pairs were evaluated. The post-menstrual weeks (median and IQR) of the three groups were: 26 (24–28) n = 2603; 34 (33–35) n = 2501; and 38 (37–39) n = 21,058. The chance of normoxemia (65, 95%-CI 64–67%) was similar across the SpO(2) range of 88–95%, and independent of PMA. The increasing risk of severe hypoxemia became marked at a SpO(2) of 85% (25, 95%-CI 21–29%), and was independent of PMA. The risk of severe hyperoxemia was dependent on PMA. For infants < 33 weeks it was marked at 98% SpO(2) (25, 95%-CI 18–33%), for infants 33–36 weeks at 97% SpO(2) (24, 95%-CI 14–25%) and for those > 36 weeks at 96% SpO(2) (20, 95%-CI 17–22%). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of hyperoxemia and hypoxemia increases exponentially as SpO(2) moves towards extremes. Postmenstrual age influences the threshold at which the risk of hyperoxemia became pronounced, but not the thresholds of hypoxemia or normoxemia. The thresholds at which a marked change in the risk of hyperoxemia and hypoxemia occur can be used to guide the setting of alarm thresholds. Optimal management of neonatal oxygen saturation must take into account concerns of alarm fatigue, staffing levels, and FiO(2) titration practices.","Bachman, Thomas E.; Iyer, Narayan P.; Newth, Christopher J.

Such an attack is known as interdiction. Recently, facility location problems, addressing intentional strikes against operating facilities and strategies to reduce their impact, have received particular attention. In this paper, we present a new location-interdiction median problem aimed at designing a distribution network which is robust to the worst-case, long-term facility losses. We suppose that there are two players: defender (system designer) and attacker. The defender decides where to locate facilities to minimize the overall cost of supplying the demands of customers. The attacker determines which r facilities to interdict to maximize the cost of serving the customers from the remaining operational facilities. Note that we suppose that the facilities are attacked simultaneously and interdicted facilities become unavailable. We propose bilevel and single-level integer formulations of this problem. For a particular case when the attacker hits a single facility, we develop a fast local search procedure based on implicit enumeration of interdiction strategies. We test our approaches in a series of computational experiments on well-known test problems.","Ushakov, Anton V.; Vasilyev, Igor",Mathematical Optimization Theory and Operations Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7321708/,750

During such crises, the ordinary and unnoticed routines that structure everyday life are thrust into the spotlight as people struggle to maintain or recreate a sense of normalcy. Drawing on a range of cases including China, Russia, the UK, and USA, we examine three categories of everyday practice during the COVID-19 pandemic that respond to disruptions in daily routines and seek a return to national normality: performing national solidarities and exclusions by wearing face masks; consuming the nation in the form of panic buying and conspiracy theories; and enforcing foreign policies through social media and embodiment. This analysis thus breaks with existing works on everyday nationalism and banal nationalism that typically focus on pervasively unnoticed forms of nationalism during settled times, and it challenges approaches to contentious politics that predict protest mobilization for change rather than restoration of the status quo ante. In highlighting the ways that unsettled times disrupt domestic and international structures, this work also presents a first attempt to link everyday nationalism with growing work on international practices.","Goode, J.

Post-transplant outcomes and pulmonary function were retrospectively compared between the groups. RESULTS: The ratio of the recipient chest volume to the donor lung volume was significantly lower in the Lobar group (0.42 ± 0.15) than in the Full group (0.77 ± 0.30, P < 0.01). The calculated size matching between the donor and recipient after downsizing the grafts was significantly correlated to the ratio of the recipient chest volume to the donor lung volume (Spearman r = 0.69; P < 0.01). Early post-transplant outcomes did not significantly differ between the groups. Although the Full group showed slightly better pulmonary function after transplantation, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were similar to the Lobar group (100%, 93%, and 81% in the Lobar group vs. 92%, 78%, and 70% in the Full group; P = 0.50). CONCLUSIONS: Brain-dead donor lobar lung transplantation showed favorable post-transplant outcomes. The assessment of recipient chest cavity volume using 3D-CT volumetry may help surgeons precisely downsize oversized lung grafts prior to transplantation.","Fujimoto, Ryo; Nakajima, Daisuke; Tanaka, Satona; Yamada, Yoshito; Yutaka, Yojiro; Ohsumi, Akihiro; Hamaji, Masatsugu; Menju, Toshi; Date, Hiroshi",Gen Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7840616/,750

Likewise, malnutrition and inactivity represent a major risk for loss of functional pulmonary capacities influencing overall lung cancer severity. Therefore, the adhesion to an appropriate health lifestyle is crucial in the management of lung cancer patients despite the subtype of cancer. This review aims to summarize the available knowledge about dietary approaches as well as physical activity as the major factors that decrease the risk towards lung cancer, and improve the response to therapies. We discuss the most significant dietary schemes positively associated to body composition and prognosis of lung cancer and the main molecular processes regulated by specific diet schemes, functional foods and physical activity, i.e., inflammation and oxidative stress. Finally, we report evidence demonstrating that dysbiosis of lung and/or gut microbiome, as well as their interconnection (the gut–lung axis), are strictly related to dietary patterns and regular physical activity playing a key role in lung cancer formation and progression, opening to the avenue of modulating the microbiome as coadjuvant therapy. Altogether, the evidence reported in this review highlights the necessity to consider non-pharmacological interventions (nutrition and physical activity) as effective adjunctive strategies in the management of lung cancer.","Nigro, Ersilia; Perrotta, Fabio; Scialò, Filippo; D’Agnano, Vito; Mallardo, Marta; Bianco, Andrea; Daniele, Aurora",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7967729/,750

However, conventional clutter suppression methods cannot eliminate the great disturbances to radar system caused by wind turbines. An improved ridge regression algorithm is investigated to accurately estimate the spectral moment of the weather signal contaminated by wind turbine clutter (WTC) in this paper. Firstly, a weighted regression model is introduced to solve the problem that the strong collinearity of the data in the regression model leads to unstable parameter estimation. Then the optimal regression parameter in the model is obtained by generalized cross validation (GCV) to improve the estimation accuracy of weather signal. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the spectral moment recovered by the proposed algorithm has better accuracy and stability in lower SNR.","Ji, Yv; Yao, Xu; Wang, Xiaodong; Shen, Mingwei",Multimedia Technology and Enhanced Learning,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991377/,750

In order to reduce the computational complexity and to improve the accuracy of modeling, this paper adopts the wavelet packet threshold denoising method for spectral spectrum processing, and uses the method of wavelet packet analysis (WPA) to filter the characteristic wavelength of the spectrum. Moreover, a prediction model of SSC is proposed based on BP neural network due to its characteristics of anti-noise, anti-interference, strong nonlinear conversion ability and the good capacity in handling nonlinear measured data with uncertain causality. Finally, the simulation results show that wavelet packet analysis can not only reduce the calculation of modeling variables, but also Improve modeling accuracy of the BP neural network model.

We present a simple new proof that is based on a relation-algebraic specification of the notions in question and combines relation-algebraic laws and equational reasoning with Scott induction. It is very formal and most parts of it consist of relation-algebraic calculations. This opens up the possibility for mechanised verification. As an application we prove a relation-algebraic version of the Dedekind isomorphism theorem.

Here, we studied binding of phenylalanyl-tRNAPhe to the CDPS from Candidatus Glomeribacter gigasporarum (Cglo-CDPS) by gel filtration and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. We determined the crystal structure of the Cglo-CDPS:Phe-tRNAPhe complex to 5 Å resolution and further studied it in solution using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The data show that the major groove of the acceptor stem of the aa-tRNA interacts with the enzyme through the basic β2 and β7 strands of CDPSs belonging to the XYP subfamily. A bending of the CCA extremity enables the amino acid moiety to be positioned in the P1 pocket while the terminal A76 adenosine occupies the P2 pocket. Such a positioning indicates that the present structure illustrates the binding of the first aa-tRNA. In cells, CDPSs and the elongation factor EF-Tu share aminoacylated tRNAs as substrates. The present study shows that CDPSs and EF-Tu interact with opposite sides of tRNA.

While type I IFN signaling is mediated by STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9, type II IFN signaling requires only STAT1. Here, we studied the roles of these signaling factors in the host response to systemic infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). In wild-type (WT) mice and mice lacking either STAT2 or IRF9, LCMV infection was nonlethal, and the virus either was cleared (WT) or established persistence (STAT2 knockout [KO] and IRF9 KO). However, in the case of STAT1 KO mice, LCMV infection was lethal and accompanied by severe multiorgan immune pathology, elevated expression of various cytokine genes in tissues, and cytokines in the serum. This lethal phenotype was unaltered by the coabsence of the gamma interferon (IFN-γ) receptor and hence was not dependent on IFN-γ. Equally, the disease was not due to a combined defect in type I and type II IFN signaling, as IRF9 KO mice lacking the IFN-γ receptor survived infection with LCMV. Clearance of LCMV is mediated normally by CD8(+) T cells. However, the depletion of these cells in LCMV-infected STAT1 KO mice was delayed, but did not prevent, lethality. In contrast, depletion of CD4(+) T cells prevented lethality in LCMV-infected STAT1 KO mice and was associated with a reduction in tissue immune pathology. These studies highlight a fundamental difference in the role of STAT1 versus STAT2 and IRF9. While all three factors are required to limit viral replication and spread, only STAT1 has the unique function of preventing the emergence of a lethal antiviral CD4(+) T-cell response.","Hofer, Markus J; Li, Wen; Manders, Peter; Terry, Rachael; Lim, Sue Ling; King, Nicholas J C; Campbell, Iain L",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.07147-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22496215/,750

DESIGN A 13-question online survey was distributed to members of the Australian Society of Orthodontists. The survey gathered information regarding respondent demographics, the number of MCLCPS-eligible patients seen in the past 12 months and usual billing practices. RESULTS A total of 96 complete responses were obtained. About 70% of respondents had treated MCLCPS-eligible patients in the past 12 months and 55% saw between 2 and 5 patients during this time. The likelihood of treating patients with clefts increased by a factor of 4.8 (95% CI: 1.2-18.9) if practicing outside of a capital city and 1.5 times for each decade increase in orthodontist's age (95% CI: 1.0-2.2).

Nonthermal irreversible electroporation (IRE) provides focal ablation with effects dependent on the electric field distribution, which changes in heterogeneous environments. It should be determined if highly conductive metallic implants in targeted regions, such as radiotherapy brachytherapy seeds in prostate tissue, will alter treatment outcomes. Theoretical and experimental models determine the impact of prostate brachytherapy seeds on IRE treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study delivered IRE pulses in nonanimal, as well as in ex vivo and in vivo tissue, with and in the absence of expired radiotherapy seeds. Electrical current was measured and lesion dimensions were examined macroscopically and with magnetic resonance imaging. Finite-element treatment simulations predicted the effects of brachytherapy seeds in the targeted region on electrical current, electric field, and temperature distributions. RESULTS There was no significant difference in electrical behavior in tissue containing a grid of expired radiotherapy seeds relative to those without seeds for nonanimal, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments (all p > 0.1). Numerical simulations predict no significant alteration of electric field or thermal effects (all p > 0.1). Histology showed cellular necrosis in the region near the electrodes and seeds within the ablation region; however, there were no seeds beyond the ablation margins. CONCLUSION This study suggests that electroporation therapies can be implemented in regions containing small metallic implants without significant changes to electrical and thermal effects relative to use in tissue without the implants. This supports the ability to use IRE as a salvage therapy option for brachytherapy.","Neal, Robert E; Smith, Ryan L; Kavnoudias, Helen; Rosenfeldt, Franklin; Ou, Ruchong; Mclean, Catriona A; Davalos, Rafael V; Thomson, Kenneth R",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-013-0704-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23942593/,750

However, effects on mortality and the generalizability of results to routine clinical practice are uncertain. METHODS In a prospective observational register-based study patients with ischemic stroke treated either with thrombectomy, intravenous thrombolysis, or their combination were included. Primary outcome was the modified Rankin scale score (0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 3 months. Ordinal logistic regression was used to estimate the common odds ratio as treatment effects (shift analysis). Propensity score matching was applied to compare patients treated either with intravenous thrombolysis alone or with intravenous thrombolysis plus thrombectomy. RESULTS Among 2650 recruited patients, 1543 received intravenous thrombolysis, 504 underwent thrombectomy, and 603 received intravenous thrombolysis in combination with thrombectomy. Later time-to-treatment was associated with worse outcomes among patients treated with thrombectomy plus thrombolysis. In 241 pairs of propensity score-matched patients with a proximal intracranial occlusion, thrombectomy plus thrombolysis was associated with improved functional outcome (common odds ratio, 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-2.57), and reduced mortality (15% versus 33%; P<0.0001) compared with intravenous thrombolysis alone. Results were similar in various sensitivity analyses accounting for missing outcome data and different analytic methods. CONCLUSIONS Results from this large prospective registry show that also in routine clinical care thrombectomy plus thrombolysis compared with thrombolysis alone improved functional outcome and reduced mortality in patients with ischemic stroke.

Off-target immune activation leads to immune-related adverse events affecting multiple organ systems, including the cardiovascular system. In this review, we discuss the current literature describing the epidemiology, mechanisms and proposed management of cardiotoxicities related to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies and bispecific T-cell engagers. ICIs are monoclonal antibody antagonists that block a co-inhibitory pathway used by tumour cells to evade a T cell-mediated immune response. ICI-associated cardiotoxicities include myocarditis, pericarditis, atherosclerosis, arrhythmias and vasculitis. ICI-associated myocarditis is the most recognised and potentially fatal cardiotoxicity with mortality approaching 50%. Recently, ICI-associated dysregulation of the atherosclerotic plaque immune response with prolonged use has been linked to early progression of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. Treatment strategies include immunosuppression with corticosteroids and supportive care. In CAR T-cell therapy, autologous T cells are genetically engineered to express receptors targeted to cancer cells. While stimulating an effective tumour response, they also elicit a profound immune reaction called cytokine release syndrome (CRS). High-grade CRS causes significant systemic abnormalities, including cardiovascular effects such as arrhythmias, haemodynamic compromise and cardiomyopathy. Treatment with interleukin-6 inhibitors and corticosteroids is associated with improved outcomes. The evidence shows that, although uncommon, immunotherapy-related cardiovascular toxicities confer significant risk of morbidity and mortality and benefit from rapid immunosuppressive treatment. As new immunotherapies are developed and adopted, it will be imperative to closely monitor for cardiotoxicity.","Stein-Merlob, Ashley F; Rothberg, Michael V; Ribas, Antoni; Yang, Eric H",Heart,https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2020-318083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33722826/,750

In this paper, we present the protocol for two systematic reviews of parameters for estimating the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from stroke attributable to exposure to long working hours, to inform the development of the WHO/ILO joint methodology. OBJECTIVES We aim to systematically review studies on occupational exposure to long working hours (called Systematic Review 1 in the protocol) and systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of long working hours on stroke (called Systematic Review 2), applying the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology as an organizing framework, conducting both systematic reviews in tandem and in a harmonized way. DATA SOURCES Separately for Systematic Reviews 1 and 2, we will search electronic academic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, CISDOC and PsychINFO. We will also search electronic grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand-search reference list of previous systematic reviews and included study records; and consult additional experts. STUDY ELIGIBILITY AND CRITERIA We will include working-age (≥15 years) workers in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State, but exclude children (<15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. For Systematic Review 1, we will include quantitative prevalence studies of relevant levels of occupational exposure to long working hours (i.e. 35-40, 41-48, 49-54 and ≥55 h/week) stratified by country, sex, age and industrial sector or occupation, in the years 2005-2018. For Systematic Review 2, we will include randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the relative effect of a relevant level of long working hours on the incidence of or mortality due to stroke, compared with the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (i.e. 35-40 h/week).

Competency-based assessment is a key part of the education of future workforces. Although there has been recent attention on competency-based assessment in dietetics, there is little exploration of competency-based education for the preparation of nutritionists. The present study aimed to understand how competency-based assessment is implemented and evaluated in nutrition education. METHODS A systematic literature review was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines. Four databases were initially searched in February 2020 using key words related to competenc* in combination with nutrition or dietetic and their synonyms. An updated search was completed again in March 2021. Studies that met eligibility criteria where the focus was on nutrition and involved a method of competency-based assessment were synthesised narratively. RESULTS From a total of 6262 titles and abstracts, six studies on competency assessment in nutrition education were identified. The assessments focused on the development of key skills, including motivational interviewing and nutrition assessment, changes to knowledge and attitudes on food and culture, and self-perceived development of communication, collaboration, management, advocacy, scholarship and professional capabilities. No studies were found that assessed promotion of health and wellbeing or the food chain competencies.

The development of a feasible comprehensive psychological approach to complement pharmacotherapy to improve its clinical management is required. The main objective of the present randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to test the efficacy of a novel adjunctive treatment entitled integrative approach in patients with BD, including: psychoeducation, mindfulness training, and functional remediation. METHODS This is a parallel two-armed, rater-blind RCT of an integrative approach plus treatment as usual (TAU), v. TAU alone. Participants were recruited at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona and randomized to one of the two conditions. They were assessed at baseline and after finishing the intervention. The main outcome variable included changes in psychosocial functioning assessed through the Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST). RESULTS After finishing the treatment, the repeated-measures analyses revealed a significant group × time interaction in favor of the patients who received the integrative approach (n = 28) compared to the TAU group (n = 37) (Pillai's trace = 0.10; F(1,57) = 6.9; p = 0.01), improving the functional outcome. Significant effects were also found in two out of the six domains of the FAST, including the cognitive domain (Pillai's trace = 0.25; F(1,57) = 19.1; p < 0.001) and leisure time (Pillai's trace = 0.11; F(1,57) = 7.15; p = 0.01). Regarding the secondary outcomes, a significant group × time interaction in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale changes was detected (Pillai's trace = 0.08; F(1,62) = 5.6; p = 0.02).

DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS 29 cats. PROCEDURES Medical records of cats that developed retroperitoneal fibrosis after renal transplantation at the College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, between 1998 and 2011 were reviewed for signalment, date of transplantation, age, results of urine and blood analyses, blood pressure at the time of diagnosis, infectious disease and medication anamneses, anesthetic protocols, and intraoperative complications. RESULTS Of 138 transplant recipients, 29 (21%) developed clinically important retroperitoneal fibrosis. Nineteen (66%) were male, and median age at the time of renal transplantation was 8 years (range, 4 to 13 years). Median number of days after transplantation to diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis was 62 (range, 4 to 730 days; mean, 125 days). The most common clinical signs were lethargy and anorexia. All affected cats were azotemic (BUN concentration > 32 mg/dL; creatinine concentration > 2.0 mg/dL) and anemic (PCV < 35%) at the time of retroperitoneal fibrosis diagnosis, although cats were nonazotemic at the time of discharge following transplantation, and anemia was less pronounced. Twenty-five cats successfully underwent surgical ureterolysis in which scar tissue was dissected away from the allograft ureter to relieve extraluminal compression. Retroperitoneal fibrosis recurred in 6 (22%) cats a median of 180 days (range, 8 to 343 days) following the original diagnosis and was treated successfully by repeated ureterolysis.

The BCC was cultured from the 2% chlorhexidine surgical scrub solution used in the clinic, suggesting the source of infection for 4 of 5 cats. Given the ability to grow in antiseptic solutions, the extra steps required to culture from antiseptics, and innate multidrug resistance, the BCC poses a challenge to both detect and treat.

Here we revisit the debate. We discuss methodological limitations of building trees with alignment-dependent approaches, which often fail to satisfactorily address the problem of ''gaps.'' In addition, most phylogenies are reconstructed unrooted, neglecting the power of direct rooting methods. Alignment-free methodologies lift most difficulties but require employing realistic evolutionary models. We argue that the discoveries of Asgards and ESPs, by themselves, do not rule out the 3D tree, which is strongly supported by comparative and evolutionary genomic analyses and vast genomic and biochemical superkingdom distinctions. Given uncertainties of retrodiction and interpretation difficulties, we conclude that the 3D view has not been falsified but instead has been strengthened by genomic analyses. In turn, the objections to the 2D model have not been lifted.

High magnitude strains at rapid rate and short bouts should theoretically elicit an osteogenic response; however, the effects of different levels of impact exercises on several outcomes in people at risk of fracture are still unknown. OBJECTIVE To report the effect of impact exercise on falls, fractures, adverse events, mortality, bone mineral density (BMD), physical functioning, and health-related quality of life (QoL). METHODS We included randomized controlled trials testing the effect of impact exercise compared with a non-exercise control on outcomes in adults ≥ 50 years with low BMD or fragility fractures. Two reviewers selected studies and extracted data. Where possible, we pooled outcomes using mean difference (MD) with a fixed-effects model and 95% confidence interval (CI). We reported risk of bias using Cochrane and certainty of evidence using GRADE. RESULTS We included 29 trials; 19 studies evaluated impact exercise alone, and the remaining trials combined impact with resistance or balance training. Impact exercise alone or combined with resistance training improved Timed Up-and-Go values (MD - 0.95 s, 95% CI - 1.09 to - 0.81, low certainty evidence) and lumbar spine (MD 0.04 g/cm2, 95% CI 0.02-0.06, low certainty evidence) and femoral neck BMD (MD 0.04 g/cm2, 95% CI 0.02-0.07, low certainty evidence). Impact exercise did not improve health-related QoL assessed with QUALEFFO-41 (MD 0.06, 95% CI - 2.18 to 2.30, moderate certainty evidence). The effects of impact exercise on falls, fractures, and mortality are uncertain due to insufficient data. Many trials had a high risk of bias for two or more items. CONCLUSIONS There is low certainty evidence that impact exercise may improve physical function and BMD in people at risk of fracture.

COVID-19 patients may display a cytokine release syndrome, which causes a severe lung inflammation, leading in many instances to death. OBJECTIVE This paper is intended at exploring the possibilities of controlling the COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation by using licensed drugs with anti-inflammatory effects. HYPOTHESIS We have previously described that pentoxifylline alone, or in combination with oxypurinol, reduces the systemic inflammation caused by experimentally-induced pancreatitis in rats. Pentoxifillyne is an inhibitor of TNF-α production and oxypurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase. TNF-α, in turn, activates other inflammatory genes such as Nos2, Icam or IL-6, which regulate migration and infiltration of neutrophils into the pulmonary interstitial tissue, causing injury to the lung parenchyma. In acute pancreatitis, the anti-inflammatory action of pentoxifylline seems to be mediated by prevention of the rapid and presumably transient loss of PP2A activity. This may also occur in the hyperinflammatory -cytokine releasing phase- of SARS-CoV2 infection. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that an early treatment of COVID-19 patients with pentoxifylline, alone or in combination with oxypurinol, would prevent the potentially lethal acute respiratory distress syndrome. CONCLUSION Pentoxifylline and oxypurinol are licensed drugs used for diseases other than COVID-19 and, therefore, phase I clinical trials would not be necessary for administration to SARS-CoV2- infected people. It would be worth trying their potential effects against hyperinflammatory response to SARS-CoV2 infection.","López-Iranzo, Francisco José; López-Rodas, Ana María; Franco, Luis; López-Rodas, Gerardo",Current pharmaceutical design,https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612826666200811180232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32787748/,750

METHODS Patients with post-operative neuroimaging and follow-up of at least one year were included. In EEG-fMRI responses, we defined as ""primary"" the cluster with the highest absolute t-value located in the cortex, and evaluated three levels of confidence for the results. The threshold for low confidence was t ≥ 3.1 (p < 0.005); the one for medium confidence corresponded to correction for multiple comparisons with a false discovery rate of 0.05; and a result reached high confidence when the primary cluster was much more significant than the next highest cluster. Concordance with the resection was determined by comparison to post-operative neuroimaging. RESULTS We evaluated 106 epilepsy surgeries in 84 patients. An increasing association between concordance and surgical outcome with higher levels of confidence was demonstrated. If the peak response was not resected, the surgical outcome was likely to be poor: for the high confidence level, no patient had a good outcome; for the medium and low levels, only 18% and 28% had a good outcome. The positive predictive value remained low for all confidence levels, indicating that removing the maximum cluster did not ensure seizure freedom. CONCLUSION Resection of the primary EEG-fMRI cluster, especially in high confidence cases, is necessary to obtain a good outcome, but not sufficient. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provided Class II evidence that failure to resect the primary EEG-fMRI cluster is associated with poorer epilepsy surgery outcomes.","Koupparis, Andreas; von Ellenrieder, Nicolás; Khoo, Hui Ming; Zazubovits, Natalja; Nguyen, Dang Khoa; Hall, Jeffery A; Dudley, Roy W R; Dubeau, Francois; Gotman, Jean",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000012660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400584/,750

METHODS We searched databases for reports evaluating the Ross procedure in patients aged more than or equal to 16 years of age. A microsimulation model was used to evaluate age- and gender-specific life expectancy for patients undergoing the Ross procedure. RESULTS Data were pooled from 63 articles totaling 19 155 patients from 20 countries. Perioperative mortality was 2.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.9-3.1; N = 9978). We found a mortality risk of 5.9% (95% CI: 4.8-7.2) at a mean follow-up of 7.2 years (N = 7573). The rate of perioperative clinically significant bleeding was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.1-3.0); re-exploration for bleeding 4.6% (95% CI: 3.1-6.3); postoperative clinically significant bleeding from 30 days until a mean of 7.1 years was 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2-1.0). At a mean of 6.9 years of follow-up, reintervention rate of any operated valve was 7.9% (95% CI: 5.7-10.3). The risk of valve thrombosis was 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.5) at 7.6 years; peripheral embolism 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.4) at 6.4 years; stroke 0.9% (95% CI: 0.7-1.2) at 6.5 years; and endocarditis 2.1% (95% CI: 1.6-2.6) at 8.0 years. Microsimulation reported a 40-year-old undergoing the Ross procedure to have a life expectancy of 35.4 years and event-free life expectancy of 26.6 years. CONCLUSIONS Ross procedure in nonelderly adults is associated with low mortality and low risk of adverse events both at short- and long-term follow-up. The surgical community must prioritize a large, expertize-based randomized controlled trial to definitively address the risks and benefits of the Ross procedure compared to conventional aortic valve replacement.","Sibilio, Serena; Koziarz, Alex; Belley-Côté, Emilie P; McClure, Graham R; MacIsaac, Sarah; Reza, Seleman J; Um, Kevin J; Lengyel, Alexandra; Mendoza, Pablo; Alsagheir, Ali; Alraddadi, Hatim; Gupta, Saurabh; Schneider, Adriaan W; Patel, Parth M; Brown, John W; Chu, Michael W A; Peterson, Mark D; Ouzounian, Maral; Paparella, Domenico; El-Hamamsy, Ismail; Whitlock, Richard P",Journal of cardiac surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.14020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30866116/,750

143125,Questioning Biomedicine's Privileging of Disease and Measurability.,2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND Publications of microsurgical testicular sperm extraction (mTESE) techniques and outcomes are heterogeneous, which may limit creation of best surgical practices. OBJECTIVE To study the quality and heterogeneity of published mTESE outcomes via a methodological analysis MATERIALS/METHODS: A systematic methodological analysis of all published literature on the use of mTESE in men with non-obstructive azoospermia from 1999 to the July 2020 was performed. PubMed and MEDLINE searches were performed using the search terms ""microdissection TESE OR microsurgical TESE"". Publications were evaluated on their reporting of preoperative factors, intraoperative techniques, surgical and clinical outcomes, and adverse events. RESULTS 55 studies met inclusion criteria. Surgical technique and sperm retrieval rates were the most reported criteria. Reporting on the presence of an embryologist intraoperatively was observed in approximately 30% of articles, while other procedural details including method of sperm quantification, quantity retrieved, and number of cryopreserved vials were observed in fewer than 10% of articles. Clinical outcomes, including pregnancy rates and live birth rates were reported in fewer than 40% of the articles. Fetal outcomes including fetal and neonatal anomalies were rarely reported. Fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, small or large for gestational age, and NICU admissions were never reported. CONCLUSION There are inconsistencies in reporting quality of mTESE outcomes, specifically a lack of information on the quantity and quality of sperm retrieved, the role of embryology intraoperatively, and clinical outcomes, such as live birth rate and fetal anomalies. These gaps may guide development of standardized reporting guidelines to better assess and compare clinical outcomes across institutions and maintain focus on couples-centric fertility outcomes in future mTESE studies.","Ernandez, John; Berk, Brittany; Han, Tracy; Ghayda, Ramy Abou; Kathrins, Martin",Andrology,https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.12997; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33675583/,750

154480,Cohesion in Distancing.,2020-04-01,"INTRODUCTION Health care institutions constantly must be prepared for disaster response. However, there are deficiencies in the current level of preparedness. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors affecting the perception of health care workers (HCWs) towards individual and institutional preparedness for a disaster. METHODS A survey on disaster incident preparedness was conducted among doctors, nurses, and allied health workers over a period of two months in 2010. The survey investigated perceptions of disaster preparedness at the individual and institutional level. Responses were measured using a five-point Likert scale. The primary outcomes were factors affecting HCWs' perception of institution and individual preparedness. Secondary outcomes were the proportions of staff willing to participate and to place importance on disaster response training and their knowledge of access to such training. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Logistic regression was performed to determine the factors that influenced the HCWs' perception of their individual and institutional readiness. Odd ratios (ORs) of such factors were reported with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS Of 1700 HCWs, 1534 (90.2%) completed the survey. 75.3% (1155/1534) felt that the institution was ready for a disaster incident, but only 36.4% (558/1534) felt that they (as individuals) were prepared. Some important factors associated with a positive perception of institution preparedness were leadership preparedness (OR = 13.19; 95% CI, 9.93-17.51), peer preparedness (OR = 6.11; 95% CI, 4.27-8.73) and availability of training opportunities (OR = 4.76; 95% CI, 3.65-6.22). Some important factors associated with a positive perception of individual preparedness were prior experience in disaster response (OR = 2.80; 95% CI, 1.99-3.93), institution preparedness (OR = 3.71; 95% CI, 2.68-5.14), peer preparedness (OR = 3.49; 95% CI, 2.75-4.26), previous training in disaster response (OR = 3.48; 95% CI, 2.76-4.39) and family support (OR = 3.22; 95% CI, 2.54-4.07). Most (80.7%, 1238/1534) were willing to participate in future disaster incident response training, while 74.5% (1143/1534) felt that being able to respond to a disaster incident constitutes part of their professional competency. However, only 27.8% (426/1534) knew how to access these training opportunities. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that HCWs fare poorly in their perception of their individual preparedness. Important factors that might contribute to improving this perception at the individual and institution level have been identified. These factors could guide the review and implementation of future disaster incident response training in health care institutions.","Lim, Ghee Hian; Lim, Beng Leong; Vasu, Alicia",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x1300349x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23639622/,750

Children are no longer able to go regularly to schools as normal. They should then rely mainly on themselves to learn and acquire knowledge. The Understand My World app is a new technological solution that allows children to learn new Arabic vocabularies interactively and independently using their smart phones or tablets (i.e., iPad, iPhone). They can use the devices' camera and microphone to explore the world, understand spoken words, and read written language properly. Images captured by the camera are recognized, labeled, and defined in both speech and writing. Children can also speak into their device to record their speech and listen to it. They can address questions and receive answers. The app then presents the dictated words in both spoken and written form. Using the required Internet connection, the interface automatically provides exceedingly accurate image and speech recognition, all while preserving the participants' anonymity. We use two AI platforms namely Clarifai and Houndify. The application is designed to be intuitive and seamless to use, which makes it very attractive to children to learn through multimedia. © 2021 IEEE.","Ali, Z.; Saleh, M.; Al-Maadeed, S.; Elsaud, S.

Commonly used screening methods are reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or antigen tests, which need to be periodically repeated. This paper proposes a methodology for detecting the disease in non-invasive way using wearable devices and for the analysis of bio-markers using artificial intelligence. This paper have reused a publicly available dataset containing COVID-19, influenza, and Healthy control data. In total 27 COVID-19 positive and 27 healthy control were pre-selected for the experiment, and several feature extraction methods were applied to the data. This paper have experimented with several machine learning methods, such as XGBoost, k-nearest neighbour k-NN, support vector machine, logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, and statistically evaluated their perfomance using various metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The proposed experiment reached 78 % accuracy using the k-NN algorithm which is significantly higher than reported for state-of-the-art methods. For the cohort containing influenza, the accuracy was 73 % for k-NN. Additionally, we identified the most relevant features that could indicate the changes between the healthy and infected state. The proposed methodology can complement the existing RT-PCR or antigen screening tests, and it can help to limit the spreading of the viral diseases, not only COVID-19, in the non-invasive way.

175111,The 6th International Conference On Climate Change (6th ICCC) Preface,2021,"Our primary objective was to investigate whether HEXACO personality profiles predict different coping strategies during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We chose a person-centered approach as it enabled visibility of personal structures differentiating between adaptive and maladaptive coping in a nonclinical sample. Latent profile analysis identified three distinct personality profiles, each profile complemented by its specific choice of coping strategies. The Resilient (conscientious extroverts) used strategies focused on the stressor (Problem-focused, Emotion-focused coping, and Humor);the Undercontrolled (conscienceless) turned to Avoidance of problem-solving strategies;the Overcontrolled (emotionally reactive and conscientious introverts) avoided Humor and handling of their own emotions. Combination of Conscientiousness scores differentiated between adaptive and maladaptive resilience. However, high Emotionality in conjunction with Introversion and high Conscientiousness produced both vulnerability and maladaptation. Absence of Avoidance is the paramount feature of adaptive resilience. Thus, personality related variance in stress response is mostly determined by traits responsible for control, proactivity, and affectivity.","Gojkovic, V.; Ocovaj, S.

Objectively testing the effectiveness of social media advertising remains difficult due to a lack of guiding frameworks and applicable behavioral measures. This study examines advertising appeals' effectiveness in driving engagement and actions on and beyond social media platforms. METHOD: In an experiment, positive, negative and coactive ads were shared on social media and promoted for a week. The three ads were controlled in an A/B testing experiment to ensure applicable comparison. Measures used included impressions, likes, shares and clicks following the multi-actor social media engagement framework. Data were extracted using Facebook ads manager and website data. Significance was tested through a series of chi-square tests. RESULTS: The promoted ads reached over 21,000 users. Significant effect was found for appeal type on engagement and behavioral actions. The findings support the use of negative advertising appeals over positive and coactive appeals. CONCLUSION: Practically, in the charity and environment context, advertisers aiming to drive engagement on social media as well as behavioral actions beyond social media should consider negative advertising appeals. Theoretically, this study demonstrates the value of using the multi-actor social media engagement framework to test advertising appeal effectiveness. Further, this study proposes an extension to evaluate behavioral outcomes.","Yousef, Murooj; Dietrich, Timo; Rundle-Thiele, Sharyn",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,750

Iterative cycles were used to develop codes via a constant comparison technique. Emerging categories from codes were refined to identify core themes. RESULTS: Core themes were explored, including: reduced clinical experience and patient contact compared with student expectations; challenges to learning opportunities in ENT; and the experience of different teaching methods, or preference for face-to-face teaching. CONCLUSION: Medical students on ENT placement have expectations of patient contact for learning opportunities. ENT departments should ensure that patient contact and face-to-face learning opportunities are facilitated, while maintaining safety, including appropriate personal protective equipment provision.","Walker, M; Stapleton, E",J Laryngol Otol,,750

In response to the need for mechanical ventilators, designed and tested an emergency ventilator (EV) that can control a patient's peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and breathing rate, while keeping a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP). This article describes the rapid design, prototyping, and testing of the EV. The development process was enabled by rapid design iterations using additive manufacturing (AM). In the initial design phase, iterations between design, AM, and testing enabled a working prototype within one week. The designs of the 16 different components of the ventilator were locked by additively manufacturing and testing a total of 283 parts having parametrically varied dimensions. In the second stage, AM was used to produce 75 functional prototypes to support engineering evaluation and animal testing. The devices were tested over more than two million cycles. We also developed an electronic monitoring system and with automatic alarm to provide for safe operation, along with training materials and user guides. The final designs are available online under a free license. The designs have been transferred to more than 70 organizations in 15 countries. This project demonstrates the potential for ultra-fast product design, engineering, and testing of medical devices needed for COVID-19 emergency response.","King, William P; Amos, Jennifer; Azer, Magdi; Baker, Daniel; Bashir, Rashid; Best, Catherine; Bethke, Eliot; Boppart, Stephen A; Bralts, Elisabeth; Corey, Ryan M; Dietkus, Rachael; Durack, Gary; Elbel, Stefan; Elliott, Greg; Fava, Jake; Goldenfeld, Nigel; Goldstein, Molly H; Hayes, Courtney; Herndon, Nicole; Jamison, Shandra; Johnson, Blake; Johnson, Harley; Johnson, Mark; Kolaczynski, John; Lee, Tonghun; Maslov, Sergei; McGregor, Davis J; Milner, Derek; Moller, Ralf; Mosley, Jonathan; Musser, Andy; Newberger, Max; Null, David; O039,; Bryan, Lucas; Oelze, Michael; Leary, Jerry; Pagano, Alex; Philpott, Michael; Pianfetti, Brian; Pille, Alex; Pizzuto, Luca; Ricconi, Brian; Rubessa, Marcello; Rylowicz, Sam; Shipley, Clifford; Singer, Andrew C; Stewart, Brian; Switzky, Rachel; Tawfick, Sameh; Wheeler, Matthew",PLoS One,,750
240283,Tweet Length Matters: A Comparative Analysis on Topic Detection in Microblogs,2021,"PURPOSE: The development of multi-gene signatures has led to improvements in identification of breast cancer patients at high risk of recurrence. The prognostic power of commercially available gene signatures is mostly restricted to estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. On the contrary, immune-related gene signatures predict prognosis only in ER-negative breast cancer. This study aimed to develop a better prognostic signature for breast cancer. METHODS: The expressions of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes from 30 independent microarray datasets with a total of 4813 samples were analyzed. A prognostic lncRNA signature was developed based on likelihood-ratio Cox regression analysis. Survival analysis was used to compare the prognostic efficiencies of our signature and 10 previously reported prognostic gene signatures. RESULTS: Cox regression analysis on 30 independent datasets showed that the 6-lncRNA signature identified in this study performed as well as five commercially available signatures in recurrence prediction for ER-positive breast cancer. In ER-negative breast cancer, this lncRNA signature was as prognostic as three immune-related gene signatures. Moreover, our lncRNA signature also demonstrated a good capacity to predict recurrence risk for triple-negative breast cancer. Function analysis showed that several lncRNAs in this signature were probably involved in cell proliferation and immune processes. CONCLUSIONS: A six-LncRNA signature was identified that is prognostic for ER-positive, ER-negative, and triple-negative breast cancers and thus deserves further validation in prospective studies.","Liu, Dingxie",Breast Cancer Res Treat,,750

In this paper, we report the results of the change in air quality at two Atlantic Coastal European cities (Northwest Spain) during five lockdown weeks. The temporal evolution of gaseous (nitrogen oxides, comprising NOx, NO, and NO2;sulfur dioxide, SO2;carbon monoxide, CO;and ozone, O3) and particulate matter (PM10;PM2.5;and equivalent black carbon, eBC) pollutants were recorded before (7 February to 13 March 2020) and during the first five lockdown weeks (14 March to 20 April 2020) at seven air quality monitoring stations (urban background, traffic, and industrial) in the cities of A Coruña and Vigo. The influences of the backward trajectories and meteorological parameters on air pollutant concentrations were considered during the studied period. The temporal trends indicate that the concentrations of almost all species steadily decreased during the lockdown period with statistical significance, with respect to the pre-lockdown period. In this context, great reductions were observed for pollutants related mainly to fossil fuel combustion, road traffic, and shipping emissions (−38 to −78% for NO, −22 to −69% for NO2, −26 to −75% for NOx, −3 to −77% for SO2, −21% for CO, −25 to −49% for PM10, −10 to −38% for PM2.5, and −29 to −51% for eBC). Conversely, O3 concentrations increased from +5 to +16%. Finally, pollutant concentration data for 14 March to 20 April of 2020 were compared with those of the previous two years. The results show that the overall air pollutants levels were higher during 2018–2019 than during the lockdown period.","Moreda-Piñeiro, Jorge Sánchez-Piñero Joel Fernández-Amado María Costa-Tomé Paula Gallego-Fernández Nuria Piñeiro-Iglesias María López-Mahía Purificación Muniategui-Lorenzo Soledad",Atmosphere,,750

It is important to evaluate various types of obesity, such as visceral and sarcopenic obesity. The evidence on the associated risk of CVD, cancer and sarcopenic obesity, including pathophysiological aspects, occurrence, clinical implications and survival, needs further investigation. Sarcopenic obesity is a relatively new term. It is a clinical condition that primarily affects older adults. There are several endocrine-hormonal, metabolic and lifestyle aspects involved in the occurrence of sarcopenic obesity that affect pathophysiological aspects that, in turn, contribute to CVD and neoplasms. However, there is no available evidence on the role of sarcopenic obesity in the occurrence of CVD and cancer and its pathophysiological interplay. Therefore, this review aims to describe the pathophysiological aspects and the clinical and epidemiological evidence on the role of sarcopenic obesity related to the occurrence and mortality risk of various types of cancer and cardiovascular disease. This literature review highlights the need for further research on sarcopenic obesity to demonstrate the interrelation of these various associations.","Silveira, Erika Aparecida; da Silva Filho, Rômulo Roosevelt; Spexoto, Maria Claudia Bernardes; Haghighatdoost, Fahimeh; Sarrafzadegan, Nizal; de Oliveira, Cesar",Int. j. mol. sci.

In this study, a large-scale serological survey of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in dogs and cats was conducted during the first and second waves of COVID-19 outbreaks in Thailand, from April to December 2020. A total of 3215 serum samples were collected from dogs (n = 2102) and cats (n = 1113) living in Bangkok and in the vicinities. Serum samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by using an indirect multispecies enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Positive and suspected samples were additionally tested for neutralizing antibodies by the surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). The indirect ELISA results showed that 1.66% (35 out of 2103) of dogs and 0.36% (four out of 1112) of cats were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The sVNT results showed that all ELISA-positive and suspected samples were negative for neutralizing antibodies. Positive serum samples (35 dogs and four cats) were obtained from clinically healthy animals and animals with mild respiratory signs aged <1-13 years living in Bangkok and Samutprakarn Provinces. In summary, a serological survey revealed evidence of anti-N-IgG antibodies suggesting SARS-CoV-2 exposure in both dogs and cats during the first and second COVID-19 outbreaks in Thailand.","Udom, Kitikhun; Jairak, Waleemas; Chamsai, Ekkapat; Charoenkul, Kamonpan; Boonyapisitsopa, Supanat; Bunpapong, Napawan; Techakriengkrai, Navapon; Amonsin, Alongkorn",Transbound. emerg. dis.

A comprehensive strategy, including surveillance, diagnostics, research, clinical treatment, and development of vaccines, is urgently needed to win the battle against COVID-19. The past three unprecedented outbreaks of emerging human coronavirus infections at the beginning of the 21st century have highlighted the importance of readily available, accurate, and rapid diagnostic technologies to contain emerging and re-emerging pandemics. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) based assays performed on respiratory specimens remain the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnostics. However, point-of-care technologies and serologic immunoassays are rapidly emerging with high sensitivity and specificity as well.

Serious games provide an underutilized tool to promote learning and innovation around global health crises. In order to explore the potential of Serious Games as a policy learning tool, Global Affairs Canada, in collaboration with the Department of National Defense and academic partners, developed and implemented a matrix game aimed at prompting critical reflection and gender-based analysis on infectious disease outbreak preparedness and response. This commentary, written by the core development team, reflects on the process and outcomes of the gaming exercise, which we believe will be of interest to others hoping to promote innovative thinking and learning around global health policy and crisis response, as well as the application of serious games more broadly. MAIN BODY: Participants reported, through discussions and a post-game survey, that they felt the game was reflective of real-world decision-making and priority-setting challenges during a crisis. They reflected on the challenges that emerge around global health co-operation and outbreak preparedness, particularly noting the importance of learning to work with private actors. While participants only sporadically applied gender-based analysis or considered the social determinants of health during the game, post-game discussions led to reflection on the ways in which equity concerns are put aside during a crisis scenario and on why this happens, offering critical learning opportunities. CONCLUSION: Matrix games provide opportunities for policy-makers and health professionals to experience the challenges of global health co-operation, test ideas and explore how biases, such as those around gender, influence policy-making and implementation. Due to their flexibility, adaptability and accessibility, serious games offer a potentially powerful learning tool for global health policy-makers and practitioners.","Smith, Julia; Sears, Nathan; Taylor, Ben; Johnson, Madeline",Global Health,,750

METHODS: It was a micro-ethnography study using a sociomaterial theoretical lens. We selected two undergraduate interprofessional healthcare student groups within a large scale programme for contrastive video analysis of synchronous spatial and physical configurations, associated talk, and online activity. RESULTS: Video analysis of evolving physical configurations indicated that Group B was spatially more evenly grouped, and physically orientated to an identifiable leader, despite their blinded peer evaluations indicating distributed leadership. Group A faced a critical event at a public forum leading to spatial disruption breaking into subgroups and isolates; however, this group identified one member as a defined leader in the peer evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: Based on online scores, we found that peer identification of leaders may influence learning processes but not learning outcomes in the first IPE team meeting.

While subunit vaccines are one of the prominent options for combating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the immunogenicity of spike protein-based antigens remains unknown. When immunized in mice, the S1 domain induced much higher IgG and IgA antibody levels than the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and more efficiently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 when adjuvanted with alum. It is inferred that a large proportion of these neutralization epitopes are located in the S1 domain but outside the RBD and that some of these are spatial epitopes. This finding indicates that expression systems with posttranslational modification abilities are important to maintain the natural configurations of recombinant spike protein antigens and are critical for effective COVID-19 vaccines. Further, adjuvants prone to a Th1 response should be considered for S1-based subunit COVID-19 vaccines to reduce the potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection.","Wang, Yunfei; Wang, Lichun; Cao, Han; Liu, Cunbao",J Med Virol,,750

METHODS: We performed a single-arm interventional trial measuring NAb and total antibody titers before and after CP transfusion over a 14-day period in hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. RESULTS: NAb titers in the donor CP units were low (<1:40 to 1:160) and had no effect on recipient neutralizing activity 1 day after transfusion. NAb titers were detected in 6 of 12 patients on enrollment and in 11 of 12 at &#8805;2 time points. Average titers peaked on day 7 and declined toward day 14 (Pâ =â .004).

368628,Briefly Noted,2020,"The Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion created new financial opportunities for community health centers (CHCs) providing primary care in medically-underserved communities. However, beyond evidence of initial policy effects, little is understood in the scholarly literature about whether the ACA Medicaid expansion affected longer-lasting changes in CHC patient insurance mix. This study's objective was to examine whether the ACA Medicaid expansion was associated with lasting increases in the annual percentage of adult CHC patients covered by Medicaid and decreases in the annual percentage of uninsured adult CHC patients at expansion-state CHCs, compared to non-expansion-state CHCs. This observational study examined 5353 CHC-year observations from 2012 to 2018 using Uniform Data System data and other national data sources. Using a 2-way fixed-effects multivariable regression approach and marginal analysis, intermediate-term policy effects of the Medicaid expansion on annual CHC patient coverage outcomes were estimated. By 5-years post-expansion, the Medicaid expansion was associated with an overall average increase of 11.7 percentage points in the percentage of adult patients with Medicaid coverage at expansion-state CHCs, compared to non-expansion-state CHCs. Among expansion-state CHCs, 39.8% of adult patients were predicted to have Medicaid coverage 5-years post-expansion, compared to 19.0% of non-expansion-state adult CHC patients. A state's decision to expand Medicaid was similarly associated with decreases in the annual percentage of uninsured adult CHC patients. Primary care operations at CHCs critically depend on patient Medicaid revenue. These findings suggest the ACA Medicaid expansion may provide longer-term financial security for expansion-state CHCs, which maintain increases in Medicaid-covered adult patients even 5-years post-expansion. However, these financial securities may be jeopardized should the ACA be ruled unconstitutional in 2021, a year after CHCs experienced new uncertainties caused by COVID-19.","Goldstein, Evan V",Inquiry,,750

The former relies on spatiotemporal patterns found between the frames of a single echo cine and the latter on the interdependencies between multiple cines. The combined supervisions are used to learn a feature-rich embedding space where multiple echo cines can be temporally synchronized. We evaluate the framework with multiple experiments: 1) Using data from 998 patients, Echo-SyncNet shows promising results for synchronizing Apical 2 chamber and Apical 4 chamber cardiac views; 2) Using data from 3070 patients, our experiments reveal that the learned representations of Echo-SyncNet outperform a supervised deep learning method that is optimized for automatic detection of fine-grained cardiac phase; 3) We show the usefulness of the learned representations in a one-shot learning scenario of cardiac keyframe detection. Without any fine-tuning, keyframes in 1188 validation patient studies are identified by synchronizing them with only one labeled reference study. We do not make any prior assumption about what specific cardiac views are used for training and show that Echo-SyncNet can accurately generalize to views not present in its training set.

380752,A Social Media Mining Using Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis on Tourism in Malaysia During Covid19,2021,"Importance: Procuring respiratory protection for clinicians and other health care workers has become a major challenge of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and has resulted in nonstandard practices such as the use of expired respirators and various decontamination processes to prolong the useful life of respirators in health care settings. In addition, imported, non-National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved respirators have been donated or acquired by hospitals as a potential replacement for limited NIOSH-approved N95 respirators. Objective: To assess fitted filtration efficiencies (FFEs) for face mask alternatives used during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: For this quality-improvement study conducted between April and June 2020, we used the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Quantitative Fit Testing Protocol for Filtering Facepiece Respirators in a laboratory atmosphere supplemented with sodium chloride particles to assess the FFEs of a variety of respirators worn by a male volunteer and female volunteer. Main Outcomes and Measures: The FFEs of respirators commonly worn by clinicians and other health care workers and available respirator alternatives during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Of the 29 different fitted face mask alternatives tested on 1 man and 1 woman, expired N95 respirators with intact elastic straps and respirators subjected to ethylene oxide and hydrogen peroxide sterilization had unchanged FFE (>95%). The performance of N95 respirators in the wrong size had slightly decreased performance (90%-95% FFE). All of the respirators not listed as approved in this evaluation (n = 6) failed to achieve 95% FFE. Neither of the 2 imported respirators authorized for use by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that were not NIOSH-approved tested in this study achieved 95% FFE, and the more effective of the 2 functioned at approximately 80% FFE. Surgical and procedural face masks had filtering performance that was lower relative to that of N95 respirators (98.5% overall FFE), with procedural face masks secured with elastic ear loops showing the lowest efficiency (38.1% overall FFE). Conclusions and Relevance: This quality-improvement study evaluating 29 face mask alternatives for use by clinicians interacting with patients during the COVID-19 pandemic found that expired N95 respirators and sterilized, used N95 respirators can be used when new N95 respirators are not available. Other alternatives may provide less effective filtration.","Sickbert-Bennett, Emily E; Samet, James M; Clapp, Phillip W; Chen, Hao; Berntsen, Jon; Zeman, Kirby L; Tong, Haiyan; Weber, David J; Bennett, William D",JAMA intern. med.

389955,Seven days in medicine: 12-18 May 2021,2021,"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a powerful tool to complement syndromic surveillance: first, as an early-warning system for the spread of the virus in the community, second, to find hotspots of infection, and third, to aid in the early detection and follow-up of circulating virus variants. Although detection of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater may be prompted with good recoveries during periods of high community prevalence, in the early stages of population outbreaks concentration procedures are required to overcome low viral concentrations. Several methods have become available for the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 from raw wastewater, generally involving filtration. However, these methods are limited to small sample volumes, possibly missing the early stages of virus circulation, and restrained applicability across different water matrices. The aim of this study was thus to evaluate the performance of three methods enabling the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 from large volumes of wastewater: i) hollow fiber filtration using the inuvai R180, with an enhanced elution protocol and polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation; ii) PEG precipitation; and iii) skimmed milk flocculation. The performance of the three approaches was evaluated in wastewater from multiple wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) with distinct singularities, according to: i) effective volume; ii) percentage of recovery; iii) extraction efficiency; iv) inhibitory effect; and v) the limits of detection and quantification (The inuvai R180 system had the best performance, with detection of spiked controls across all samples, average recovery percentages of 64% for SARS-CoV-2 control and 68% for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), with low variability. The inuvai R180 enables the scalability of volumes without negative impact on the costs, time for analysis, and recovery/inhibition. Moreover, hollow fiber filters favor the concentration of different microbial taxonomic groups. Such combined features make this technology attractive for usage in environmental waters monitoring.","Monteiro, Silvia; Rente, Daniela; Cunha, Monica V.; Marques, Tiago; Cardoso, Eugenia; Alvaro, Pedro; Vilaca, Joao; Ribeiro, Jorge; Silva, Marco; Coelho, Norberta; Broco, Nuno; Carvalho, Marta; Santos, Ricardo",,,750

In the case of inflation, this study aims to make some adjustment to the pricing and replenishment strategy of perishable food and compare it with the scenario without considering inflation to determine the impact of the inflation rate, quality deterioration, time value of money, and characteristics of cash flow of perishable food sales on the supply chain decision-making. We used the discounted cash flow (DCF) model to measure retailers’ revenue, which established that the optimal pricing and replenishing strategy could maximize the retailers’ profit. Besides, the findings were compared with the traditional profit model. Moreover, numerical experiments and sensitivity analysis were provided for decision support to retailers. Overall, this study validates that inflation significantly affects the pricing and replenishment strategy, and the DCF model is more suitable to evaluate the profits of perishable food.","Huang, Xiangmeng Yang Shuai Wang Zhanyu",Computers &amp; Industrial Engineering,,750
393016,An application of probability density function for the analysis of PM2.5 concentration during the COVID-19 lockdown period,2021,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Maternal gestational infection is a well-characterized risk factor for offsprings' development of mental disorders including schizophrenia, autism, and attention deficit disorder. The inflammatory response elicited by the infection is partly directed against the placenta and fetus and is the putative pathogenic mechanism for fetal brain developmental abnormalities. Fetal brain abnormalities are generally irreversible after birth and increase risk for later mental disorders. Maternal immune activation in animals models this pathophysiology. SARS-CoV-2 produces maternal inflammatory responses during pregnancy similar to previously studied common respiratory viruses. METHOD: Choline, folic acid, Vitamin D, and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are among the nutrients that have been studied as possible mitigating factors for effects of maternal infection and inflammation on fetal development. Clinical and animal studies relevant to their use in pregnant women who have been infected are reviewed. RESULTS: Higher maternal choline levels have positive effects on the development of brain function for infants of mothers who experienced viral infections in early pregnancy. No other nutrient has been studied in the context of viral inflammation. Vitamin D reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines in some, but not all, studies. Active folic acid metabolites decrease anti-inflammatory cytokines. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have no effect. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D and folic acid are already supplemented in food additives and in prenatal vitamins. Despite recommendations by several public health agencies and medical societies, choline intake is often inadequate in early gestation when the brain is forming. A public health initiative for choline supplements during the pandemic could be helpful for women planning or already pregnant who also become exposed or infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Hoffman, M Camille; Freedman, Robert; Law, Amanda J; Clark, Alena M; Hunter, Sharon K",Clin Nutr ESPEN,,750
396298,Evaluating the impact of mobility on COVID-19 pandemic with machine learning hybrid predictions,2021,"Conventional factor analyses can present problems in cases with changing numbers of sources and/or time-dependent source compositions. There is also lack of a reliable method to estimate uncertainties in the source contributions derived by positive matrix factorization (PMF). Applying a moving window evolving PMF to hourly PM2.5 composition dataset from a field campaign in Tianjin China that included the Spring and Lantern Festivals and the start of COVID-19 pandemic has substantially improved the apportionment compared to a conventional analysis using the entire data. Festival-related sources (e.g., fireworks and residential burning here) have been clearly identified and estimated during both the Spring and Lantern Festivals. During this period, the sources changed because the time period overlaps with the outbreak of COVID-19 and related reductions in activity during the lockdown that began on Lunar New Year. Multiple PMF runs providing source contribution estimates made it possible to estimate the uncertainties in these values. Our results show that winds-dependent sources like dust and distant point sources have larger uncertainties than the other sources. Compared with conventional PMF analyses, the current method may better reflect the actual emissions as well as being able to estimate uncertainties. Thus, this approach appears to be an improvement if the appropriate data are available. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Song, L.; Dai, Q.; Feng, Y.; Hopke, P. K.",Environmental Pollution,,750

As a result, the observations in the natural setting of the baby’s home changed and became tele-observations. The difficulties of teaching infant observation during this period, as well as the anxieties they induced in both the seminar leader and the observers, are described. Feelings about concepts such as loss, absence, separation, distance and closeness were felt in a much stronger way in the countertransference during this period.

A PHMG solution was intratracheally administrated to 40 male rats. Chest CT was carried out in all rats and both lungs were collected for histopathologic evaluation. At 4- and 8-weeks post-instillation, one lobe of the right lung from 3 rats was subjected to RNA sequencing. At least one abnormal CT finding was found in all rats at all weeks. The major CT findings were inflammation, fibrosis, and tumors in the pathologic analysis, where significant changes were observed over time. The lung lesions remained persistent after 8 weeks of PHMG exposure. In the pathologic analysis, the extent/severity of inflammation did not show statistically significant changes over time, whereas the extent/severity of fibrosis increased continuously up to 6 weeks after PHMG exposure and then decreased significantly at 8 weeks. Bronchiolar-alveolar adenomas which have malignant potential were found in 50% of rats at 6 and 8 weeks after PHMG exposure. Also, several genes associated with lung cancer, acute lung injury, and pulmonary fibrosis were detected.

The purpose of this review was to identify and synthesize outpatient rehabilitation assessment and treatment recommendations for adults in postacute COVID-19 stages. METHODS: MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), Central, CINAHL, and Scopus were searched from January 1, 2020, to December 7, 2020. Teams of 2 reviewers independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data. All study designs that included rehabilitation recommendations were included. Study design, country, study population, purpose, and rehabilitation recommendations were recorded. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument was used to evaluate the quality of consensus guidelines. RESULTS: Forty-eight articles fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria (11 systematic reviews, 1 scoping review, 6 original research studies, 4 consensus guidelines, 26 narrative reviews, and editorials/commentaries). Recommended outcomes included exercise tolerance, respiratory function, muscle strength, and activities of daily living (ADL) or functional independence. Recommended treatments included respiratory rehabilitation, exercise therapy, education, psychological support, ADL and gait training, traditional Chinese medicine, and cognitive and vocational rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: There were incongruities between what is known about postacute COVID-19 and what was recommended in the literature. Given the relatively large proportion of survivors who experience ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 or post-COVID-19 syndrome, it is important to quickly develop tools for self-management and access to rehabilitation specialists in multidisciplinary teams.

We aim to report the case series of critical patients receiving IMV in Wuhan and to discuss the timing of IMV in these patients. METHODS: Data of 657 patients admitted to emergency intensive care unit of Zhongnan Hospital and isolated isolation wards of Wuhan Union Hospital from January 1 to March 10, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. All medical records of 40 COVID-19 patients who required IMV were collected at different time points, including baseline (at admission), before receiving IMV, and before death or hospital discharge. RESULTS: Among 40 COVID-19 patients with IMV, 31 died, and 9 survived and was discharged. The median age was 70 years (interquartile range [IQR], 62-76 years), and nonsurvivors were older than survivors. The median period from the noninvasive mechanic ventilation (NIV) or high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) to intubation was 7 hours (IQR, 2-42 hours) in IMV survivors and 54 hours (IQR, 28-143 hours) in IMV nonsurvivors. We observed that, when the time interval from NIV/HFNC to intubation was less than 50 hours (about 2 calendar days), together with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score of less than 10 or pneumonia severity index (PSI) score of less than 100, mortality can be reduced to 60% or less. Prolonged interval from NIV/HFNC to intubation and high levels of APACHE II and PSI before intubation were associated with higher mortality in critically ill patients. Multiple organ damage was common among these nonsurvivors in the course of treatment. CONCLUSION: Early initial intubation after NIV/HFNC might have a beneficial effect in reducing mortality for critically ill patients meeting IMV indication. Considering APACHE II and PSI scores might help physicians in decision making about timing of intubation for curbing subsequent mortality.

469150,Robust Multichannel Encoding for Highly Multiplexed Quantitative PCR,2021,"Both coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and mycobacterial immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in patients with HIV-1 infection result from immunopathology that is characterized by increased production of multiple pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines associated with activation of myeloid cells (monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils). We propose that both conditions arise because innate immune responses generated in the absence of effective adaptive immune responses lead to monocyte/macrophage activation that is amplified by the emergence of a pathogen-specific adaptive immune response skewed towards monocyte/macrophage activating activity by the immunomodulatory effects of cytokines produced during the innate response, particularly interleukin-18. In mycobacterial IRIS, that disease-enhancing immune response is dominated by a Th1 CD4+ T cell response against mycobacterial antigens. By analogy, it is proposed that in severe COVID-19, amplification of monocyte/macrophage activation results from the effects of a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody response with pro-inflammatory characteristics, including high proportions of IgG3 and IgA2 antibodies and afucosylation of IgG1 antibodies, that arises from B cell differentiation in an extra-follicular pathway promoted by activation of mucosa-associated invariant T cells. We suggest that therapy for the hyperinflammation underlying both COVID-19 and mycobacterial IRIS might be improved by targeting the immunomodulatory as well as the pro-inflammatory effects of the 'cytokine storm'.","Seddiki, Nabila; French, Martyn",Front Immunol,,750

Naturally, this has brought urban transport systems under a near standstill, which in turn resulted in a sharp drop in carbon emissions and levels of air pollution in affected areas. While the induced health and economic crisis is already lasting longer and affecting many more than originally expected, questions arise on what that means for the future of urban living, urban design and connectivity. A post-COVID-19 city could notably see a sustained drop in demand for commuting transport due to a combination of enduring economic crisis and changing work habits. It could experience a behavioural shift with regard to crowded spaces, and public transport in particular. In such context, this snapshot piece aims first at examining the possible consequences on public health of this scenario. Secondly, it uses system thinking to evaluate how stimulus plans could maximise social, health and climate co-benefits. It takes the example of populous middle-income countries to suggest a shift to investing in infrastructure focused on active travel modes, as the most prone to cheaply sustain hygiene, social-equity, reduced exposure to air pollution, reduced numbers of fatal accidents, and enhanced levels of physical activity.","Koehl, Arnaud",Cities Health,,750

Chest radiography and CT are the imaging tools used to diagnose and monitor patients with COVID-19. Lung ultrasound (LUS) during COVID-19 is being used in some areas to aid decision-making and improve patient care. However, its increased use could help improve existing practice for patients with suspected COVID-19, or other lung disease. A limitation of LUS is that it requires practitioners with sufficient competence to ensure timely, safe, and diagnostic clinical/imaging assessments. This commentary discusses the role and governance of LUS during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, and how increased education and training in this discipline can be undertaken given the restrictions in imaging highly infectious patients. The use of simulation, although numerical methods or dedicated scan trainers, and machine learning algorithms could further improve the accuracy of LUS, whilst helping to reduce its learning curve for greater uptake in clinical practice.","Wolstenhulme, Stephen; McLaughlan, James Ross",Br J Radiol,,750
599868,Dendritic cell deficiencies persist seven months after SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021-07-21,"INTRODUCTION: To find effective and safe treatments for COVID-19, the WHO recommended to systemically evaluate experimental therapeutics in collaborative randomised clinical trials. As COVID-19 was spreading in Europe, the French national institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm) established a transdisciplinary team to develop a multi-arm randomised controlled trial named DisCoVeRy. The objective of the trial is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of different investigational re-purposed therapeutics relative to Standard of Care (SoC) in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: DisCoVeRy is a phase III, open-label, adaptive, controlled, multicentre clinical trial in which hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in need of oxygen therapy are randomised between five arms: (1) a control group managed with SoC and four therapeutic arms with re-purposed antiviral agents: (2) remdesivir + SoC, (3) lopinavir/ritonavir + SoC, (4) lopinavir/ritonavir associated with interferon (IFN)-β−1a + SoC and (5) hydroxychloroquine + SoC. The primary endpoint is the clinical status at Day 15 on the 7-point ordinal scale of the WHO Master Protocol (V.3.0, 3 March 2020). This trial involves patients hospitalised in conventional departments or intensive care units both from academic or non-academic hospitals throughout Europe. A sample size of 3100 patients (620 patients per arm) is targeted. This trial has begun on 22 March 2020. Since 5 April 2020, DisCoVeRy has been an add-on trial of the Solidarity consortium of trials conducted by the WHO in Europe and worldwide. On 8 June 2020, 754 patients have been included. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Inserm is the sponsor of DisCoVeRy. Ethical approval has been obtained from the institutional review board on 13 March 2020 (20.03.06.51744) and from the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) on 9 March 2020.

The deferral of elective cardiovascular procedures led to a marked reduction in healthcare delivery with a significant impact on optimal cardiovascular care. International and Canadian data have reported dramatically increased wait-times for diagnostic tests and cardiovascular procedures, as well as associated increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the wake of the demonstrated ability to rapidly create critical care and hospital ward capacity, we advocate a different approach during the second and possible subsequent COVID-19 pandemic waves. We suggest an approach, informed by local data and experience, which balances the need for an expected rise in demand for healthcare resources to ensure appropriate COVID-19 surge capacity, with continued delivery of essential cardiovascular care. Incorporating cardiovascular care leaders into pandemic planning and operations will help healthcare systems minimize cardiac care delivery disruptions, while maintaining critical care and hospital ward surge capacity and continuing measures to reduce transmission risk in healthcare settings. Specific recommendations targeting the main pillars of cardiovascular care are presented: ambulatory, inpatient, procedural, diagnostic, surgical and rehabilitation.","Roifman, Idan; Arora, Rakesh C.; Bewick, David; Chow, Chi-Ming; Clarke, Brian; Cowan, Simone; Ducharme, Anique; Gin, Kenneth; Graham, Michelle; Gupta, Anil; Hardiman, Sean; Hartleib, Michael; Jackson, Simon; Jassal, Davinder; Kazmi, Mustapha; Lamarche, Yoan; Légaré, Jean-François; Leong-Poi, Howard; Mansour, Samer; Marelli, Ariane; Ruel, Marc; Small, Gary; Sterns, Larry; Turgeon, Ricky; Virani, Sean; Wijeysundera, Harindra C.; Wong, Kenny; Wood, David A.; Zieroth, Shelley; Singh, Gurmeet; Krahn, Andrew D.",Can J Cardiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0828282X2031117X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.11.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33307163/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0828282X2031117X?v=s5,750

Extensive molecular surveillance in Guangdong, China's most populous province, during early 2020 resulted in 1,388 reported RNA positive cases from 1.6 million tests. In order to understand the molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in China we generated 53 genomes from infected individuals in Guangdong using a combination of metagenomic sequencing and tiling amplicon approaches. Combined epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate multiple independent introductions to Guangdong, although phylogenetic clustering is uncertain due to low virus genetic variation early in the pandemic. Our results illustrate how the timing, size and duration of putative local transmission chains were constrained by national travel restrictions and by the province's large-scale intensive surveillance and intervention measures. Despite these successes, COVID-19 surveillance in Guangdong is still required as the number of cases imported from other countries is increasing.","Lu, Jing; Plessis, Louis du; Liu, Zhe; Hill, Verity; Kang, Min; Lin, Huifang; Sun, Jiufeng; Francois, Sarah; Kraemer, Moritz U G; Faria, Nuno R; McCrone, John T; Peng, Jinju; Xiong, Qianling; Yuan, Runyu; Zeng, Lilian; Zhou, Pingping; Liang, Chuming; Yi, Lina; Liu, Jun; Xiao, Jianpeng; Hu, Jianxiong; Liu, Tao; Ma, Wenjun; Li, Wei; Su, Juan; Zheng, Huanying; Peng, Bo; Fang, Shisong; Su, Wenzhe; Li, Kuibiao; Sun, Ruilin; Bai, Ru; Tang, Xi; Liang, Minfeng; Quick, Josh; Song, Tie; Rambaut, Andrew; Loman, Nick; Raghwani, Jayna; Pybus, Oliver; Ke, Changwen",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20047076,750

Two vaccine doses achieved high responses across all ages. Antibody levels increased more slowly and to lower levels with a single dose of ChAdOx1 compared with a single dose of BNT162b2, but waned following a single dose of BNT162b2 in older individuals. In descriptive latent class models, we identified four responder subgroups, including a ‘low responder’ group that more commonly consisted of people aged >75 years, males and individuals with long-term health conditions.

Quaternization stands out as an alternative to modify this natural polymer, aiming to improve its solubility over a wide pH range and, consequently, expand its range of applications. Quaternization occurs by introducing a quaternary ammonium moiety onto or outside the chitosan backbone, via chemical reactions with primary amino and hydroxyl groups, under vast experimental conditions. The oldest and most common forms of quaternized chitosan involve N,N,N-trimethyl chitosan (TMC) and N-[(2-hydroxy-3-trimethyl ammonium) propyl] chitosan (HTCC) and, more recently, quaternized chitosan by insertion of pyridinium or phosphonium salts. By modifying chitosan through the insertion of a quaternary moiety, permanent cationic charges on the polysaccharide backbone are achieved and properties such as water solubility, antimicrobial activity, mucoadhesiveness and permeability are significantly improved, enabling the application mainly in the biomedical and pharmaceutical areas. In this review, the main quaternized chitosan compounds are addressed in terms of their structure, properties, synthesis routes and applications. In addition, other less explored compounds are also presented, involving the main findings and future prospects regarding the field of quaternized chitosans.","Freitas, Emanuelle Dantas; Moura Jr., Celso Fidelis; Kerwald, Jonas; Beppu, Marisa Masumi",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33266285/; https://doi.org/10.3390/polym12122878,750

The current dominant management strategy in the UK is antibiotics, despite widespread publicity regarding antimicrobial resistance and evidence that the small benefits of antibiotics do not outweigh the harms. There is a need to address the rising problem of antibiotic resistance by providing credible alternative strategies, which reduce symptom burden. There is sufficient evidence to recommend the use of Pelargonium sidoides root extract in order to warrant undertaking an independent clinical trial. We propose a feasibility study to demonstrate our ability to recruit and retain patients and conduct a placebo-controlled trial of Pelargonium sidoides extract EPs®7630 in lower respiratory tract infection where pneumonia is not suspected. Both the tablet and liquid formulations will be included. METHODS: The HATRIC trial is a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled feasibility study aiming to determine the potential to conduct a fully powered trial of Pelargonium sidoides root extract as an alternative to the inappropriate use of antibiotics for acute bronchitis in UK primary care. Primary care sites will be equally randomised to one of two formulation groups (tablet or liquid preparation). Additionally, within each site, patients will be evenly randomised to active or placebo treatment. Antibiotic consumption will be monitored during the trial, but the use of a delayed prescription strategy is encouraged. The target sample size for this study is 160 patients overall or 40 per arm, recruited from approximately 20 primary care sites. The analysis will be descriptive focusing on estimation with no formal comparison of groups taking place. DISCUSSION: If this trial demonstrates the feasibility of recruitment and delivery, we will seek funding for a fully powered placebo-controlled trial of Pelargonium sidoides root extract for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in primary care.

Qualitative and quantitative differences in humoral and cellular immune responses associated with the flu vaccination in 2009/2010 (pandemic H1N1 vaccine) and natural infection have not yet been described in detail. We designed a longitudinal study to examine influenza- (flu-) specific immune responses and the association between pre-existing flu responses, symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI), impact of pandemic flu infection, and pandemic flu vaccination in a cohort of 2,040 individuals in Sweden in 2009–2010. METHODS: Cellular flu-specific immune responses were assessed by whole-blood antigen stimulation assay, and humoral responses by a single radial hemolysis test. RESULTS: Previous seasonal flu vaccination was associated with significantly lower flu-specific IFN-γ responses (using a whole-blood assay) at study entry. Pandemic flu vaccination induced long-lived T-cell responses (measured by IFN-γ production) to influenza A strains, influenza B strains, and the matrix (M1) antigen. In contrast, individuals with pandemic flu infection (PCR positive) exhibited increased flu-specific T-cell responses shortly after onset of ILI symptoms but the immune response decreased after the flu season (spring 2010). We identified non-pandemic-flu vaccinated participants without ILI symptoms who showed an IFN-γ production profile similar to pandemic-flu infected participants, suggesting exposure without experiencing clinical symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Strong and long-lived flu-M1 specific immune responses, defined by IFN-γ production, in individuals after vaccination suggest that M1-responses may contribute to protective cellular immune responses. Silent flu infections appeared to be frequent in 2009/2010. The pandemic flu vaccine induced qualitatively and quantitatively different humoral and cellular immune responses as compared to infection with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic H1N1 influenza strain.","Magalhaes, Isabelle; Eriksson, Mikael; Linde, Charlotte; Muhammad, Rashid; Rane, Lalit; Ambati, Aditya; Axelsson-Robertson, Rebecca; Khalaj, Bahareh; Alvarez-Corrales, Nancy; Lapini, Giulia; Montomoli, Emanuele; Linde, Annika; Pedersen, Nancy L; Maeurer, Markus",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-14-319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24916787/,750

It utilizes single breakends, breakpoints in which only one side can be unambiguously placed, in a novel virus-centric variant calling and assembly approach to identify viral integrations with high sensitivity and a near-zero false discovery rate. VIRUSBreakend detects viral integrations anywhere in the host genome including regions such as centromeres and telomeres unable to be called by existing tools. Applying VIRUSBreakend to a large metastatic cancer cohort, we demonstrate that it can reliably detect clinically relevant viral presence and integration including HPV, HBV, MCPyV, EBV and HHV-8. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: VIRUSBreakend is part of the Genomic Rearrangement IDentification Software Suite (GRIDSS). It is available under a GPLv3 license from https://github.com/PapenfussLab/VIRUSBreakend. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","Cameron, Daniel L; Jacobs, Nina; Roepman, Paul; Priestley, Peter; Cuppen, Edwin; Papenfuss, Anthony T",Bioinformatics,https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973999/,750
