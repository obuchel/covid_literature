The pneumonia was caused by a virus called SARS-Cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), which was later named coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19). The symptoms most commonly reported by patients affected by COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. In this report, we present a case of a 57-year-old woman who presented to the clinic's infectious department with swelling, pain, warmth, and redness in the left leg who was treated with therapeutic heparin. There were no typical and distinguished symptoms of COVID-19, and she had no risk factor for deep vein thrombosis. Then chest X-ray revealed bilateral patchy ground-glass opacity, and computed tomography angiography was performed to rule out pulmonary thromboembolism, which showed no evidence of thrombosis. Left lower limb venous color Doppler ultrasound revealed dilatation and thrombosis in the external iliac and left iliac veins up to the level of the bifurcation of the common iliac veins, as well as thrombosis to the superficial and small saphenous veins. Because of ground-glass opacity and lymphopenia, nasal swabs were used for sampling, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This case aims to arouse the medical staff's awareness of deep vein thrombosis as a clinical symptom of COVID-19 even if the patient has no typical symptoms of COVID-19.","Davoodi, Lotfollah; Jafarpour, Hamed; Taghavi, Morteza; Razavi, Alireza",J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,953,16

METHODS: Studies were searched from following database: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WANGFANG DATA, from inception to 1 st May 2020. Random-effects model was applied to pool the prevalence. Comparative analysis was also applied to evaluate the changes of prevalence before and after the peak of the epidemic occurred. RESULTS: 34 articles were finally included. Prevalence of depression and anxiety was higher among healthcare worker than general public. Among general public, 26 % (95 %CI: 17 %-36 %) were suffering from depression and 22 % (95 %CI: 15 %-30 %) were having anxiety during COVID-19, while the prevalence of depression and anxiety among healthcare workers was 31 % (95 %CI: 25 %-37 %) and 40 % (95 %CI: 33 %-46 %) respectively. Comparative analysis showed healthcare workers (depression: 40 %, anxiety: 38 %) had higher percentage of having depression and anxiety than the general public (depression: 33 %, anxiety: 24 %) before the peak. Then a descended prevalence among healthcare workers (depression: 22 %, anxiety: 22 %) was detected compared with that before, while the prevalence among the general public raised (depression: 62 %, anxiety: 44 %) after the peak occurred. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 epidemic had a potential psychiatric impact on general public and healthcare workers in China, which is more severer among healthcare workers. However, the psychiatric status of the general public trend to deteriorated, while healthcare workers trend to improve after the peak of epidemic.","Deng, Yongyan; Chen, Yifang; Zhang, Bin",Asian J Psychiatr,953,18

At peak, patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome may outnumber mechanical ventilators. In our Miami Hospital System, COVID-19 cases have multiplied for 4 weeks and elective surgery has been suspended. METHODS: An Otolaryngologic Triage Committee was created to appropriately allocate resources to patients. Hospital ethicists provided support. Our tumor conference screened patients for nonsurgical options. Patients were tested twice for coronavirus before performing urgent contaminated operations. N95 masks and protective equipment were conserved when possible. Patients with low-grade cancers were advised to delay surgery, and other difficult decisions were made. RESULTS: Hundreds of surgeries were canceled. Sixty-five cases screened over 3 weeks are tabulated. Physicians and patients expressed discomfort regarding perceived deviations from standards, but risk of COVID-19 exposure tempered these discussions. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the use of actively managed surgical triage to fairly balance our patient's health with public health concerns.","Civantos, Francisco J; Leibowitz, Jason M; Arnold, David J; Stubbs, Vanessa C; Gross, Jennifer H; Thomas, Giovana R; Sargi, Zoukaa; Casiano, Roy R; Franzmann, Elizabeth J; Weed, Donald; Perez, Cesar; Samuels, Michael; Goodman, Kenneth W; Goodwin, W Jarrard",Head Neck,953,26

Water samples were collected from a limestone cave (Gyokusendo cave, dropping water) and two springs (Ukinju and Komesu, spring water), and the radon concentrations were measured by liquid scintillation counters. The radon concentrations in the samples from the Gyokusendo cave, and Ukinju and Komesu springs were 10 ± 1.3 Bq L-1, 3.2 ± 1.0 Bq L-1, and 3.1 ± 1.1 Bq L-1, respectively. The radon concentrations showed a gradually increasing trend from summer to autumn and decreased during winter. The variation of radon concentrations in the dripping water sample from the Gyokusendo cave showed a lagged response to precipitation changes by approximately 2-3 months. The estimated radon concentrations in the dripping water sample were calculated with the measured radon concentrations from the dripping water obtained during the study period. Based on our results, groundwater in the Gyokusendo cave system was estimated to percolate through the Ryukyu limestone in 7-10 days, and the residence time of groundwater in the soil above Gyokusendo cave was estimated to be approximately 50-80 days. This work makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of groundwater processes in limestone aquifers, which is essential for ensuring groundwater sustainability.","Nakasone, Shunya; Ishimine, Akinobu; Shiroma, Shuhei; Masuda, Natsumi; Nakamura, Kaori; Shiroma, Yoshitaka; Ooka, Sohei; Tanaka, Masahiro; Kato, Akemi; Hosoda, Masahiro; Akata, Naofumi; Yasuoka, Yumi; Furukawa, Masahide",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),953,3

It involves digital monitoring and recording of physical proximity between people over time with a central and trusted authority, so that when one user reports infection, it is possible to identify all other users who have been in close proximity to that person during a relevant time period in the past and alert them. One way to achieve this involves recording on the server the locations, e.g. by reading and reporting the GPS coordinates of a smartphone, of all users over time. Despite its simplicity, privacy concerns have prevented widespread adoption of this method. Technology that would enable the""hiding""of data could go a long way towards alleviating privacy concerns and enable contact tracing at a very large scale. In this article we describe a general method to hide data. By hiding, we mean that instead of disclosing a data value x, we would disclose an""encoded""version of x, namely E(x), where E(x) is easy to compute but very difficult, from a computational point of view, to invert. We propose a general construction of such a function E and show that it guarantees perfect recall, namely, all individuals who have potentially been exposed to infection are alerted, at the price of an infinitesimal number of false alarms, namely, only a negligible number of individuals who have not actually been exposed will be wrongly informed that they have.","Gotsman, Craig; Hormann, Kai",,953,1

COVID-19 is an unprecedented disaster that has disrupted lives worldwide and led to a rise in the incidence of mental health disorders. Given the widespread economic devastation due to COVID-19, many RA patients, already susceptible to mental illness, maybe at an increased risk of inaccessibility to medical care, accentuated stress, and consequent worsening of existent mental health disorders, or the onset of new mental health disorders such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, or depression. The objective of this review is to assess if there is an increased risk of mental health disorders in patients with RA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine has bridged the transition to remote chronic care in the pandemic period, though certain accessibility and technological challenges are to be addressed. Decreased access to care amid lockdowns and a proposed triggering of disease activity in patients with autoimmune disorders may potentially herald a massive spike in incidence or flares of patients diagnosed with RA in the coming months. Such a deluge of cases may be potentially devastating to an overburdened healthcare system. Rheumatologists may need to prepare for this eventuality and explore techniques to provide adequate care during these challenging times. The authors found that there is a significant association between the adverse impact on the mental health of RA patients and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, more research is needed to highlight individual risk factors.","Bhatia, Ansh; Kc, Manish; Gupta, Latika",Rheumatol Int,953,1

The present prospective study extends this research by examining both specific emotion regulation strategies and global emotion regulation difficulties in the context of acute stress following onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic in 119 young adults. As part of a larger study, emotion regulation was assessed prior to pandemic onset (January 2019 - February 2020) using two standard measures (Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, ERQ, Gross & John, 2003; Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, DERS, Gratz & Roemer, 2004). A self-report assessment of acute stress was conducted 2-3½ weeks after the COVID-19 pandemic declaration. Results demonstrated cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression (i.e., ERQ) were not individually predictive of acute stress; however, there was a significant interaction of suppression by reappraisal. Simple effects indicated suppression was negatively associated with acute stress only when reappraisal levels were high. Greater global emotion regulation difficulties (i.e., DERS), particularly nonacceptance of emotions and limited access to emotion regulation strategies, significantly predicted greater acute stress. These results provide further evidence of the temporal relationship between emotion dysregulation and stress reactions, and also suggest the expected effects of emotion regulation strategies may differ across contexts.","Tyra, Alexandra T; Griffin, Siobhán M; Fergus, Thomas A; Ginty, Annie T",J Anxiety Disord,953,16

The volume and congruence of the journalistic selection of topics in Germany exceeds that of the already high level of the H1N1 pandemic 2009 many times over. In this discussion article, challenges for journalism that have arisen in reporting on the scientific aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic are described.At the beginning of the pandemic, there was a real epistemic uncertainty due to the lack of established facts. Many editorial offices lacked professional routines for the competent handling of preliminary research results and for the evaluation of scientific reputation of experts. Dealing with scientific articles that had not yet undergone peer review (preprints) became a major challenge. If peer review isn't available, science journalists have to develop new indicators to assess the quality and relevance of a preprint research publication and they need to be better equipped to distinguish valuable scientific contributions from mere ""hype.""The phenomena observed during pandemic reporting show how essential independent professional science journalism is for the democratic discourse, because only in this way can nonscientific audiences correctly classify truthful and relevant scientific content conveyed and develop informed trust in science.","Stollorz, Volker",Bundesgesundheitsblatt gesundheitsforschung gesundheitsschutz,953,1
