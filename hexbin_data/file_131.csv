To identify the causal origins of a spread, it is often necessary to identify the triggering initial node. Here, we define a new morphological operator and use it to detect the origin of a diffusive front, given the final state of a complex network. Our method performs better than algorithms based on distance (closeness) and Jordan centrality. More importantly, our method is applicable regardless of the specifics of the forward model, and therefore can be applied to a wide range of systems such as identifying the patient zero in an epidemic, pinpointing the neuron that triggers a cascade, identifying the original malfunction that causes a catastrophic infrastructure failure, and inferring the ancestral species from which a heterogeneous population evolves.","Nguyen, V.

Microgrooves were fabricated with a truncated V-shape in cross-section at 15/3.5, 30/10, and 60/10 μm (width/depth) by photolithography. Subsequent acid etching was applied to the entire surface of the fabricated Ti substratum to generate etched microgrooves and ridges (designated as E15/3.5, E30/10, and E60/10). Both smooth and acidetched-only Ti were used as controls (designated as NE0 and E0). Large-scale gene expression analyses were performed using differential display PCR, and the results were confirmed using RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. Of the 21 genes with altered expression determined by differential display PCR and sequencing, we verified through RT-PCR that MTDH and TIMP1 were up-regulated and TGF-β1, TPM1, and VIM were down-regulated in the HGFs cultured on E60/10 versus NE0. We also confirmed, by quantitative real-time PCR, that MTDH and TIMP1 expression in HGFs on E60/10 was significantly up-regulated compared to HGFs on the other Ti substrata. This study indicates that acid-etched ridges and microgrooves on Ti with a width and depth of 60 and 10 μm (E60/10) induce alterations in the expression of genes involved in cell adhesion, proliferation, and regulation of the cytoskeleton in HGFs.","Lee, Suk Won; Leesungbok, Richard; Ahn, Su Jin; Kwon, Il Keun; Yang, Dae Hyeok; Kang, Hyun Joo; Kim, Kyung Hee; Jung, Su Hee",Tissue Eng Regen Med,131,3

Key Clinical Research Questions Asked During Epidemic Respiratory Outbreaks: A Systematic Review of the Literature Published on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome,12.750222,12.909524,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Starting on 03/16/2020, the hospital was converted to attend only patients with COVID-19. A surveillance program for healthcare workers (HCWs) that included free in-site medical consultation and RT-PCR for detection of SARS-CoV-2 was initiated. On 04/28/2020, screening of HCWs was started to detect asymptomatic carriers. We report the results of such programs updated to 05/21/2020. METHODS: Sex, worker category, working area, use of personal protective equipment, date of screening, date of onset of symptoms and home address were retrieved from electronic databases. Logistic regression was done to identify factors associated with being a COVID-19 case or carrier, with p< 0.05 being significant. Odds ratios and incidence densities were calculated. RESULTS: Of 2566 HCWs in the hospital, 976 (38.0%) underwent screening and 41 (4.2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (7.4 carriers x 10,000 person-days; median follow-up of 55.5 days); none of the latter were diagnosed with COVID-19 after completing a 14-day follow-up. Of HCWs with negative screen results, 6 (0.6%) ultimately developed COVID-19 after a median of 10 days (1.1 cases x 10,000 person-days). Of 232 symptomatic HCWs that did not undergo basal screening, 131 (56.5%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 (8.8 cases x 10,000 person-days). Ten COVID-19 cases (7.6%) were hospitalized and all were discharged without complications after a median hospital stay of 9 days. Factors associated with COVID-19 were working in a non-clinical area (OR=9.3, 95% CI=1.1–78.6) and being a nurse (OR=1.9, 95% CI=1.1–3.4). Factors associated with being a carrier were living in the State of Mexico (OR=3.7, 95% CI=1.8–8.0) and being a hospital cook (OR=3.7, 95% CI=1.7–8.5). Being a physician was associated with not being a carrier (OR=0.07, 95% CI=0.01–0.5). Wearing a face mask at all times tended to be associated with not being a carrier. Hospital epidemic curves closely ressembled those of the community (Mexico City). Hospital Epidemic Curve, 03/16/2020 - 05/21/2020 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: This study suggests that factors present inside and outside of the hospital are associated with COVID-19 and asymptomatic carriage in HCWs.

Infectious diseases are more common and associated with worse outcomes among diabetics. Diabetes is considered a predictor of morbidity in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Medline, Embase, Google Scholar, and medRxiv were systematically reviewed up to May 10(th), 2020 for observational studies on diabetic adult populations hospitalized for COVID-19 and that assessed possible correlation between diabetes and mortality. A meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Heterogeneity among trials for each outcome was assessed with the I-squared test. Values < 25% indicated low, 25 to 70% moderate, and > 70% high heterogeneity. Egger test and funnel plots were used to assess for publication bias. RESULTS: Fourteen observational studies (12 retrospective and 2 prospective) met the prespecified criteria for inclusion in the analysis, including 18,506 patients (43% women): 3,713 diabetics (DM group) and 14,793 non-diabetics (no-DM group). The mean or median age was above 60 years in 12 studies. DM group had a higher risk of death compared to the no-DM group, heterogeneity was significant (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.35–1.96; I(2) 77.4%). Sensitivity analysis for US studies only also revealed a higher chance of death among the DM group (OR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.04–1.85; I(2) 73.7%). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, death was 65% more likely among diabetic inpatients compared to non-diabetics. Further studies are needed to assess whether this association is independent or not, and to investigate to role of glucose control prior or during the disease.

Acquisition of infection can occur from environmental reservoirs, person-to-person transmission and from the healthcare environment. Primary prevention of infections through infection prevention and control measures is an important strategy in cystic fibrosis care. Areas covered: Here we present a systematic review of the evidence base around infection prevention and control in cystic fibrosis. We found 36 studies and 7 guidelines that met our inclusion criteria. Strategies covered include cohort segregation, individual segregation, hand hygiene, facemasks, combination strategies, equipment strategies, and adherence. Quality of evidence overall was deemed low or very low. Most guideline recommendations have little or no evidence to support them. Expert opinion: Although low quality, there is an abundance of evidence suggesting segregation is beneficial in reducing pathogen spread. Undertaking high-quality studies may, therefore, be ethically challenging. Large-scale registry studies may provide a better strategy for answering questions on the efficacy of infection control policy. With the rise of antibiotic resistance, effective eradication of cystic fibrosis pathogens is becoming more difficult so primary prevention through infection control will become increasingly important over the coming years.","Rowbotham, Nicola J; Palser, Sally C; Smith, Sherie J; Smyth, Alan R",Expert review of respiratory medicine,131,24

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has emerged as a promising noninvasive method to determine CA continuously by using regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) as a surrogate for CBF. Little is known about its accuracy to determine CA in patients with intracranial lesions. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of rSO2-based CA monitoring with TCD methods in comatose patients with acute neurological injury. METHODS Thirty-three comatose patients were monitored at the bedside to measure CA using both TCD and NIRS. Patients were monitored daily for up to three days from coma onset. The cerebral oximetry index (COx) was calculated as the moving correlation between the slow waves of rSO2 and mean arterial pressure (MAP). The mean velocity index (Mx) was calculated as a similar coefficient between slow waves of TCD-measured CBF velocity and MAP. Optimal blood pressure was defined as the MAP with the lowest Mx and COx. Averaged Mx and COx as well as optimal MAP, based on both Mx and COx, were compared using Pearson's correlation. Bias analysis was performed between these same CA metrics. RESULTS The median duration of monitoring was 60 min (interquartile range [IQR] 48-78). There was a moderate correlation between the averaged values of COx and Mx (R = 0.40, p = 0.005). Similarly, there was a strong correlation between optimal MAP calculated for COx and Mx (R = 0.87, p < 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis showed moderate agreement with bias (±standard deviation) of -0.107 (±0.191) for COx versus Mx and good agreement with bias of 1.90 (±7.94) for optimal MAP determined by COx versus Mx. CONCLUSIONS Monitoring CA with NIRS-derived COx is correlated and had good agreement with previously validated TCD-based method. These results suggest that COx may be an acceptable substitute for Mx monitoring in patients with acute intracranial injury.","Rivera-Lara, Lucia; Geocadin, Romergryko; Zorrilla-Vaca, Andres; Healy, Ryan; Radzik, Batya R; Palmisano, Caitlin; Mirski, Marek; Ziai, Wendy C; Hogue, Charles",Neurocritical care,131,28

Studies on the clinical features between macrolide susceptible-M. pneumoniae (MSMP) and macrolide resistant-M. pneumoniae (MRMP) are lacking. The aim of this study was to identify the macrolide resistance rate of M. pneumoniae in Korean children with M. pneumoniae penupmonia in 2015 and compare manifestations between MSMP and MRMP. METHODS Among 122 children (0-18 years old) diagnosed with M. pneumoniae pneumonia, 95 children with the results of macrolide sensitivity test were included in this study. Clinical manifestations were acquired using retrospective medical records. RESULTS The macrolide resistant rate of M. pneumoniae was 87.2% (82 of 94 patients) in children with M. pneumoniae pneumonia. One patient showed a mixed type of wild type and A2063G mutation in 23S rRNA of M. pneumoniae. There were no significant differences in clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings between the MSMP and MRMP groups at the first visit to our hospital. The time interval between initiation of macrolide and defervescence was significantly longer in the MRMP group (4.9±3.3 vs. 2.8±3.1 days, P=0.039). CONCLUSION The macrolide resistant rate of M. pneumoniae is very high in children with M. pneumoniae pneumonia in Korea. The clinical manifestations of MRMP are similar to MSMP except for the defervescence period after administration of macrolide. Continuous monitoring of the occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of MRMP is required to control its spread and establish strategies for treating second-line antibiotic resistant M. pneumoniae infection.","Lee, Eun; Cho, Hyun-Ju; Hong, Soo-Jong; Lee, Jina; Sung, Heungsup; Yu, Jinho",Korean journal of pediatrics,131,1

OBJECTIVE To examine differences in alarm events between disposable and reusable ECG-LWs. METHOD Two cardiac telemetry units were randomized to reusable ECG-LWs, and 2 units alternated between disposable and reusable ECG-LWs for 4 months. A remote monitoring team, blinded to ECG-LW type, assessed frequency and type of alarm events by using total counts and rates per 100 patient days. Event rates were compared by using generalized linear mixed-effect models for differences and noninferiority between wire types. RESULTS In 1611 patients and 9385.5 patient days of ECG monitoring, patient characteristics were similar between groups. Rates of alarms for no telemetry, leads fail, or leads off were lower in disposable ECG-LWs (adjusted relative risk [95% CI], 0.71 [0.53-0.96]; noninferiority P < .001; superiority P = .03) and monitoring (artifact) alarms were significantly noninferior (adjusted relative risk [95% CI]: 0.88, [0.62-1.24], P = .02; superiority P = .44). No between-group differences existed in false or true crisis alarms. Disposable ECG-LWs were noninferior to reusable ECG-LWs for all false-alarm events (N [rate per 100 patient days], disposable 2029 [79.1] vs reusable 6673 [97.9]; adjusted relative risk [95% CI]: 0.81 [0.63-1.06], P = .002; superiority P = .12.) CONCLUSIONS Disposable ECG-LWs with patented push-button design had superior performance in reducing alarms created by no telemetry, leads fail, or leads off and significant noninferiority in all false-alarm rates compared with reusable ECG-LWs. Fewer ECG alarms may save nurses time, decrease alarm fatigue, and improve patient safety.","Albert, Nancy M; Murray, Terri; Bena, James F; Slifcak, Ellen; Roach, Joel D; Spence, Jackie; Burkle, Alicia","American journal of critical care : an official publication, American Association of Critical-Care Nurses",131,24

Epidemiologic trends among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons are not well known. METHODS We analyzed 2010-2014 Indian Health Service data on health care encounters to assess regional and temporal trends in IDU indicators among adults aged ≥18 years. IDU indicators included acute or chronic HCV infection (only among adults aged 18-35 years), arm cellulitis and abscess, OUD, and opioid-related overdose. We calculated rates per 10 000 AI/AN adults for each IDU indicator overall and stratified by sex, age group, and region and evaluated rate ratios and trends by using Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS Rates of HCV infection among adults aged 18-35 increased 9.4% per year, and rates of OUD among all adults increased 13.3% per year from 2010 to 2014. The rate of HCV infection among young women was approximately 1.3 times that among young men. Rates of opioid-related overdose among adults aged <50 years were approximately 1.4 times the rates among adults aged ≥50 years. Among young adults with HCV infection, 25.6% had concurrent OUD. Among all adults with arm cellulitis and abscess, 5.6% had concurrent OUD. CONCLUSIONS Rates of HCV infection and OUD increased significantly in the AI/AN population. Strengthened public health efforts could ensure that AI/AN communities can address increasing needs for culturally appropriate interventions, including comprehensive syringe services programs, medication-assisted treatment, and opioid-related overdose prevention and can meet the growing need for treatment of HCV infection.","Evans, Mary E; Person, Marissa; Reilley, Brigg; Leston, Jessica; Haverkate, Richard; McCollum, Jeffrey T; Apostolou, Andria; Bohm, Michele K; Van Handel, Michelle; Bixler, Danae; Mitsch, Andrew J; Haberling, Dana L; Hatcher, Sarah M; Weiser, Thomas; Elmore, Kim; Teshale, Eyasu H; Weidle, Paul J; Peters, Philip J; Buchacz, Kate",Public health reports,131,5
85246,85246,85246,Middle East respiratory syndrome: knowledge to date.,12.727441,12.880025,2015,"BACKGROUND The 2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 outbreak in upper midwestern U.S. poultry operations was not detected in wild birds to any great degree during the outbreak, despite wild waterfowl being implicated in the introduction, reassortment, and movement of the virus into North America from Asia. This outbreak led to the demise of over 50 million domestic birds and occurred mainly during the northward spring migration of adult avian populations. OBJECTIVES There have been no experimental examinations of the pathogenesis, transmission, and population impacts of this virus in adult wild waterfowl with varying exposure histories-the most relevant age class. METHODS We captured, housed, and challenged adult wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) with HPAIV H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 and measured viral infection, viral excretion, and transmission to other mallards. RESULTS All inoculated birds became infected and excreted moderate amounts of virus, primarily orally, for up to 14 days. Cohoused, uninoculated birds also all became infected. Serological status had no effect on susceptibility. There were no obvious clinical signs of disease, and all birds survived to the end of the study (14 days). CONCLUSIONS Based on these results, adult mallards are viable hosts of HPAIV H5N2 regardless of prior exposure history and are capable of transporting the virus over short and long distances. These findings have implications for surveillance efforts. The capture and sampling of wild waterfowl in the spring, when most surveillance programs are not operating, are important to consider in the design of future HPAIV surveillance programs.","Hall, Jeffrey S; Grear, Daniel A; Krauss, Scott; Seiler, J Patrick; Dusek, Robert J; Nashold, Sean W; Webster, Robert G",Influenza and other respiratory viruses,131,12

However, such enhancements may occur earlier than 72 h post-surgery. This systematic review aimed to assess the evidence on the timing of the postsurgical MRI. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane were searched following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Only original research articles describing surgically induced contrast enhancements on MRI after resection for high-grade gliomas were included and analysed. The frequency of different contrast enhancement patterns on intraoperative MRI (iMRI) and early postoperative MRI (epMRI) was recorded. The search resulted in 1443 studies after removing duplicates, and a total of 12 studies were chosen for final review. Surgically induced contrast enhancements were reported at all time points after surgery, including on iMRI, but their type and frequency vary. Thin linear contrast enhancements were commonly found to be surgically induced and were less frequently recorded on postoperative days 1 and 2. This suggests that the optimal time to scan may be at or before this time. However, the evidence is limited, and higher-quality studies using larger and consecutively sampled populations are needed.","Rykkje, Alexander Malcolm; Li, Dana; Skjøth-Rasmussen, Jane; Larsen, Vibeke Andrée; Nielsen, Michael Bachmann; Hansen, Adam Espe; Carlsen, Jonathan Frederik",Diagnostics,131,31

The aim of this study is to explore the effects of sevoflurane and isoflurane on platelets activation of patients undergoing lung cancer surgery, and the effects of sevoflurane and isoflurane on platelets-induced invasion of lung cancer cells. DESIGN Prospective and randomized study, and in vitro experiment. SETTING University-affiliated teaching hospital and laboratory. PATIENTS Forty-six patients scheduled for lung cancer radical surgery. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to two groups of 23 patients each and were received sevoflurane (group SEV) or isoflurane (group ISO) during surgery, respectively. In vitro, lung cancer cells were treated with platelets in the presence or absence anesthetics. MEASUREMENTS Platelets activation were determined by detecting glycoproteinIIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa), CD62P, and platelets aggregation rate (PAR) pre-, intra-, and postoperatively. Invasion ability of lung cancer cells were evaluated by Transwell assay. RESULTS The levels of GPIIb/IIIa, CD62P, and PAR were reduced markedly in group SEV during perioperative period compared with group ISO. In vitro, activated platelets contributed profoundly to the invasive ability of lung cancer cells. Sevoflurane, but not isoflurane, inhibited platelets-induced invasion of lung cancer cells. Furthermore, sevoflurane suppressed the platelets activity in vitro. CONCLUSION Sevoflurane attenuates platelets activation of patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. In vitro, sevoflurane suppresses platelets-induced invasion of lung cancer cells via decreasing platelets activity.","Liang, Hua; Yang, Cheng Xiang; Zhang, Bin; Zhao, Zhen Long; Zhong, Ji Ying; Wen, Xian Jie",Journal of clinical anesthesia,131,6

Nano-scale HA particles are increasingly being used as carriers for controlled and targeted delivery of bioactive agents like drugs, proteins, and nucleic acids due to their high porosity, negative charge, and biodegradability. Purpose Although much effort has been devoted to understanding the delivery kinetics and effects of the payloads in such carriers, a thorough understanding of the influence of the carriers themselves is lacking. Methods HA particles (300 µg/mL) were administered to primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). The uptake and intracellular localization of the particles were determined by flow cytometry, confocal imaging, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Immunological assays and PCR were performed to determine the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and collagens in cell lysates and media supernatant. Results The current study explores the effects of poly-dispersed HA particles on primary HDFs as a model system. The majority of the particles were determined to range between 150 and 200 nm in diameter. Upon exposure to HA suspensions, primary HDFs internalized the particles by endocytosis within 6 hours of exposure, showing maximum uptake at 72 hours following which the particles were exocytosed by 168 hours. This correlated to reduced secretion of various pro-inflammatory and pro-collagenic cytokines. Biochemical analysis further revealed a reduction in Type I collagen expression and secretion. Conclusion HA particles have an immune-modulatory effect on dermal fibroblasts and reduce collagen production, which may impact the integrity of the extracellular matrix (ECM). This study demonstrates the need to consider the secondary effects of particulate carriers like HA, beyond basic cytotoxicity, in the specific tissue environment where the intended function is to be realized.","Rakshit, Moumita; Gautam, Archana; Toh, Li Zhen; Lee, Ying Shi; Lai, Hui Ying; Wong, Tina T; Ng, Kee Woei",International journal of nanomedicine,131,16

Lactate is also a signaling molecule of increasing medical relevance. Lactate levels in the blood can increase in both normal and pathophysiological conditions (e.g., hypoxia, physical exercise, or sepsis), however the manner by which these changes are sensed and induce adaptive responses is unknown. Here we show that the carotid body (CB) is essential for lactate homeostasis and that CB glomus cells, the main oxygen sensing arterial chemoreceptors, are also lactate sensors. Lactate is transported into glomus cells, leading to a rapid increase in the cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio. This in turn activates membrane cation channels, leading to cell depolarization, action potential firing, and Ca2+ influx. Lactate also decreases intracellular pH and increases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, which further activates glomus cells. Lactate and hypoxia, although sensed by separate mechanisms, share the same final signaling pathway and jointly activate glomus cells to potentiate compensatory cardiorespiratory reflexes.","Torres-Torrelo, Hortensia; Ortega-Sáenz, Patricia; Gao, Lin; López-Barneo, José",Nature communications,131,12

The Guidance Supplement is intended to provide aesthetic medicine physicians and their staffs with a practical guide to safety considerations to support clinic preparedness for patients seeking non-surgical aesthetic treatments and procedures following the return-to-work phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, once such activity is permitted by applicable law. Many federal, state and local governmental authorities, public health agencies and professional medical societies have promulgated COVID-19 orders and advisories applicable to health care practitioners. The Guidance Supplement is intended to provide aesthetic physicians and their staffs with an additional set of practical considerations for delivering aesthetic care safely and generally conducting business responsibly in the new world of COVID-19. Aesthetic providers will face new and unique challenges as government stay-at-home orders and related commercial limitations are eased, and the U.S. economy reopens and healthcare systems transition from providing only urgent and other essential treatment to resuming routine care and elective procedures and services. The medical aesthetic specialties will therefore wish to resume practice in order to ensure high quality, expert care is available, and importantly to help promote patients' positive self-image and sense of well-being following a lengthy and stressful period of quarantine. In a number of areas, this Guidance Supplement exceeds traditional aesthetic office safety precautions, recognizing reduced tolerance in an elective treatment environment for any risk associated with COVID-19's highly variable presentation and unpredictable course. The disease has placed a disturbing number of young, otherwise healthy patients in extremis with severe respiratory and renal failure, stroke, pericarditis, neurologic deficits and other suddenly life-threatening complications, in addition to its pernicious effects on those with pre-existing morbidities and advanced age. Accordingly, the Guidance Supplement seeks to establish an elevated safety profile for providing patient care while reducing, to the greatest extent reasonably possible, the risk of infectious processes to both patients and providers. While the Guidance Supplement cannot foreclose the risk of infection, nor serve to establish or modify any standards of care, it does offer actionable risk-mitigation considerations for general office comportment and for certain non-surgical procedures typically performed in aesthetic medical settings. It is axiomatic that all such considerations are necessarily subject to the ultimate judgment of each individual healthcare professional based on patient situation, procedure details, office environment, staffing constraints, equipment and testing availability, and local legal status and public health conditions.","Dover, Jeffrey S; Moran, Mary Lynn; Figueroa, Jose F; Furnas, Heather; Vyas, Jatin M; Wiviott, Lory D; Karchmer, Adolf W",Facial plastic surgery & aesthetic medicine,131,30

The purpose of this experimental study was to evaluate whether the techniques' effectiveness depended on the clot composition and to visualize the interaction between the devices and the clot. MATERIALS AND METHODS Erythrocyte-rich (red) and fibrin-rich (white) clots were placed into the M1-segment of the middle cerebral artery in a transparent vascular phantom with physiological architecture. Physiological hemodynamic conditions were maintained with a programmable pump. On the one hand direct aspiration with a 5F aspiration catheter (ADAPT) and on the other hand stent retrieval with a balloon guide catheter (flow arrest/reversal) was performed. The experiments were made under direct visual control to observe the interaction between the devices and the clot. The primary end points were the number of passes/maneuvers and the occurrence of distal emboli and emboli in a new territory (anterior cerebral artery), until full recanalization was achieved. The experiment was filmed with a full high-definition camera identifying emboli. RESULTS Six experiments were conducted for each technique and clot model. Red clots were retrieved by ADAPT with fewer passes and distal emboli, and could usually be aspirated directly at the occlusion site. White clots clogged the tip of the 5F aspiration catheter in every experiment. The catheter had to be pulled back into the long sheath in the cervical internal carotid artery, producing distal emboli. White clots were retrieved by the stent retriever and balloon guide catheter with fewer distal emboli. There was no difference in the number of passes. The stent-thrombus interaction was superficial in both clot models. Successful retrieval was granted by the flow arrest and proximal aspiration/flow reversal. One embolus in a new territory developed when using each technique in white clots. CONCLUSION This experimental study showed that the efficacy of advanced thrombectomy techniques might depend on clot composition. Identifying the right technique for the right clot might improve the results of thrombectomy. In a clinical setting the thrombus morphology in non-enhanced CT could be used as a marker for patient selection.

Acupuncture-moxibustion could produce the local and systemic anti-inflammatory effect on COVID-19 through the activation of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Compared with humoral anti-inflammatory pathway, the neuronal anti-inflammatory pathway has earlier initiation, rapider action, and more localization, which play a more important role in the initial stage of inflammatory response. This may be an important basis for acupuncture-moxibustion intervention in the early stage of COVID-19. In addition to cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, acupuncture-moxibustion may also play an anti-inflammatory role in activating sympathetic nerve, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and other neural anti-inflammatory pathways. How acupuncture-moxibustion play its role in stimulating the vagus nerve and sympathetic nerve in different periods of inflammatory response, and whether the effect is based on the selection of acupoints and the methods of stimulation, will be the research direction of the transformation from basic research to clinical research for acupuncture-moxibustion.","He, Wei; Shi, Xiao-Shuang; Zhang, Zhi-Yun; Su, Yang-Shuai; Wan, Hong-Ye; Wang, Yi; Yu, Xiao-Chun; Zhu, Bing; Jing, Xiang-Hong",Zhongguo zhen jiu = Chinese acupuncture & moxibustion,131,1

The TNM (tumor-node-metastasis) classification system for lung cancer is a vital guide for determining treatment and prognosis. Despite the importance of accuracy in lung cancer staging, however, correct staging remains a challenging task for many radiologists. The new 7th edition of the TNM classification system features a number of revisions, including subdivision of tumor categories on the basis of size, differentiation between local intrathoracic and distant metastatic disease, recategorization of malignant pleural or pericardial disease from stage III to stage IV, reclassification of separate tumor nodules in the same lung and lobe as the primary tumor from T4 to T3, and reclassification of separate tumor nodules in the same lung but not the same lobe as the primary tumor from M1 to T4. Radiologists must understand the details set forth in the TNM classification system and be familiar with the changes in the 7th edition, which attempts to better correlate disease with prognostic value and treatment strategy. By recognizing the relevant radiologic appearances of lung cancer, understanding the appropriateness of staging disease with the TNM classification system, and being familiar with potential imaging pitfalls, radiologists can make a significant contribution to treatment and outcome in patients with lung cancer.","UyBico, Stacy J; Wu, Carol C; Suh, Robert D; Le, Nanette H; Brown, Kathleen; Krishnam, Mayil S","Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",131,16

METHODS Neurophysiology event logs and anesthetic records from 220 craniotomies for aneurysm clipping were reviewed for unacceptable patient movement or reason for cessation of MEPs. Muscle relaxants were not given after intubation. Transcranial MEPs were recorded from bilateral abductor hallucis and abductor pollicis muscles. MEP stimulus intensity was increased up to 500 V until evoked potential responses were detectable. RESULTS Out of 220 patients, 7 (3.2%) exhibited unacceptable movement with MEP stimulation-2 had nociception-induced movement and 5 had excessive field movement. In all but one case, MEP monitoring could be resumed, yielding a 99.5% monitoring rate. CONCLUSIONS With the anesthetic and monitoring regimen, the authors were able to record MEPs of the upper and lower extremities in all patients and found only 3.2% demonstrated unacceptable movement. With a suitable anesthetic technique, MEP monitoring in the upper and lower extremities appears to be feasible in most patients and should not be withheld because of concern for movement during neurovascular surgery.","Hemmer, Laura B; Zeeni, Carine; Bebawy, John F; Bendok, Bernard R; Cotton, Mathew A; Shah, Neil B; Gupta, Dhanesh K; Koht, Antoun",World neurosurgery,131,31

The COVID-19 International Student Well-being Study (C19 ISWS) is a cross-sectional multicountry study that collected data on higher-education students during the COVID-19 outbreak in the spring of 2020. The dataset allows description of: (1) living conditions, financial conditions, and academic workload before and during the COVID-19 outbreak; (2) the current level of mental well-being and effects on healthy lifestyles; (3) perceived stressors; (4) resources (e.g., social support and economic capital); (5) knowledge related to COVID-19; and (6) attitudes toward COVID-19 measures implemented by the government and relevant HEI. The dataset additionally includes information about COVID-19 measures taken by the government and HEI that were in place during the period of data collection. The collected data provide a comprehensive and comparative dataset on student well-being. In this article, we present the rationale for this study, the development and content of the survey, the methodology of data collection and sampling, and the limitations of the study.

To address this limitation, the literature was systematically reviewed for randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled studies reporting exercise performance outcome metrics with NO3 supplementation in young, healthy adults. Of the 2033 articles identified, 80 were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis demonstrated that exercise performance improved with NO3 supplementation compared with placebo (d = 0.174; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.120-0.229; P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses conducted on biological sex, aerobic fitness, and FiO2 demonstrated that the ergogenic effect of NO3 supplementation was as follows: 1) not observed in studies with only women (n = 6; d = 0.116; 95% CI, -0.126 to 0.358; P = 0.347), 2) not observed in well-trained endurance athletes (≥65 mL·kg·min; n = 26; d = 0.021; 95% CI, -0.103 to 0.144; P = 0.745), and 3) not modulated by FiO2 (hypoxia vs normoxia). Together, the meta-analyses demonstrated a clear ergogenic effect of NO3 supplementation in recreationally active, young, healthy men across different exercise paradigms and NO3 supplementation parameters; however, the effect size of NO3 supplementation was objectively small (d = 0.174). NO3 supplementation has more limited utility as an ergogenic aid in participants with excellent aerobic fitness that have optimized other training parameters. Mechanistic research and studies incorporating a wide variety of subjects (e.g., women) are needed to advance the study of NO3 supplementation; however, additional descriptive studies of young, healthy men may have limited utility.","Senefeld, Jonathon W; Wiggins, Chad C; Regimbal, Riley J; Dominelli, Paolo B; Baker, Sarah E; Joyner, Michael J",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,131,33

During infection, viruses may evolve various strategies, such as modulating stress granules (SGs) formation, to create an optimal surroundings for viral replication. However, the interplay between PRV infection and SGs formation remains largely unknown. Here we showed that PRV infection markedly blocked SGs formation induced by sodium arsenate (AS) and DL-Dithiothreitol (DTT). Accordantly, the phosphorylation of eIF2α was markedly inhibited in PRV-infected cells, although two eIF2α kinases double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) were activated during PRV infection. Furthermore, we also found that the dephosphorylation of eIF2α occurred at the early stage of virus infection but without the elevated production of GADD34 and PP1. Moreover, inhibition of PP1 activity by salubrinal could counteract PRV-mediated eIF2α dephosphorylation partially and inhibit virus replication. Our results revealed that, on the one hand, PRV infection activated eIF2α kinases PKR (latter inhibited) and PERK, and on the other hand, PRV encoded-functions dephosphorylated eIF2α and inhibited SGs formation to facilitate virus replication.","Xu, Shengkui; Chen, Dongjie; Chen, Dengjin; Hu, Qianlin; Zhou, Lei; Ge, Xinna; Han, Jun; Guo, Xin; Yang, Hanchun",Veterinary microbiology,131,12

There is little evidence comparing the efficacy and patient-reported outcomes between the 2 endovenous solutions. This study compares the RFA and EVLT strategies in a prospective double-blind clinical trial. METHODS Consecutive patients with primary unilateral great saphenous vein (GSV) reflux undergoing endovenous treatment were randomized to RFA (VNUS ClosureFAST) or EVLT (810-nm diode laser). The primary outcome measure was GSV occlusion at 3 months after treatment. Secondary outcome measures were occlusion at 7 days, postoperative pain, analgesic requirement, and bruising, assessed at day 7 after surgery. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed preoperatively and 3 months after surgery using the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ) and EQ-5D. RESULTS A total of 159 patients were randomized to RFA (79 patients) or EVLT (80 patients). Groups were well matched for demographics, disease extent, severity, and preoperative QoL. Duplex scanning confirmed 100% vein occlusion at 1 week in both groups. At 3 months, occlusion was 97% for RFA and 96% for EVLT; P = 0.67.

Postoperative pain assessed at each of the first 7 postoperative days was less after RFA (P = 0.001). Changes in the AVVQ (P = 0.12) and EQ-5D (P = 0.66) at 3 months were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS RFA and EVLT offer comparable venous occlusion rates at 3 months after treatment of primary GSV varices; with neither modality proving superior. RFA is associated with less periprocedural pain, analgesic requirement, and bruising.

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies addressing the frequency of structural valve deterioration (SVD) after TAVI. METHODS We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane CENTRAL from 2002 to September 2016. We included observational studies following patients with TAVI for at least 2 years. Independently and in duplicate, we evaluated study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias for SVD post-TAVI. Our review used the GRADE system to assess quality of evidence. We pooled incidence rates using a random effects model. RESULTS Thirteen studies including 8914 patients, with a median follow-up between 1.6 and 5 years, reported an incidence of SVD post-TAVI between 0 to 1.34 per 100 patient years. The pooled incidence of SVD was 28.08 per 10 000 patients/year (95% CI 2.46 to 73.44 per 100 patient years). Of those who developed SVD, 12% underwent valve re-intervention. Confidence in the evidence was moderate due to inconsistency among studies. CONCLUSION Structural valve deterioration is probably an infrequent event within the first 5 years after TAVI. Ascertaining the impact of SVD and the need for valve-related re-interventions to inform recommendations for patients with a longer life-expectancy will require studies including a large number of patients with longer follow-up (>10 years).","Foroutan, Farid; Guyatt, Gordon H; Otto, Catherine M; Siemieniuk, Reed A; Schandelmaier, Stefan; Agoritsas, Thomas; Vandvik, Per O; Bhagra, Sai; Bagur, Rodrigo",Heart,131,1

Most PD-L1 inhibitors contain modified fragment crystallizable region (Fc) receptor binding sites to prevent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against PD-L1-expressing non-tumor cells. However, natural killer (NK) cells have specific antitumor activity in the presence of tumor-targeting antibody through ADCC, which could enhance NK cell-induced cytotoxicity. We evaluated the antitumor efficacy of ADCC via anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and NK cells against several PD-L1-positive cancer cell lines. METHODS Various cancer cell lines were used as target cell lines. Surface PD-L1 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. IMC-001 and anti-hPD-L1-hIgG1 were tested as anti-PD-L1 mAbs with ADCC and atezolizumab as an anti-PD-L1 mAb without ADCC. NK cell cytotoxicity was measured by 51Cr-release assay and CD107a degranulation assay. Also, live cell imaging was performed to evaluate cytotoxicity in a single-cell level. NK-92-CD16 (CD16-transduced NK-92 cell line) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors, respectively, were used as an effector cell. FcγRIIIa (CD16a)-V158F genotyping was performed for healthy donors. RESULTS We demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of NK-92-CD16 cells toward PD-L1-positive cancer cell lines was significantly enhanced in the presence of anti-PD-L1 mAb with ADCC. We also noted a significant increase in primary human NK cell cytotoxicity against PD-L1-positive human cancer cells when cocultured with anti-PD-L1 mAb with ADCC. Moreover, NK cells expressing a FCGR3A high-affinity genotype displayed higher anti-PD-L1 mAb-mediated ADCC lysis of tumor cells than donors with a low-affinity genotype. CONCLUSION These results suggest that NK cells induce an ADCC response in combination with anti-PD-L1 mAbs, which helps promote ADCC antitumor activity against PD-L1-positive tumors. This study provides support for NK cell immunotherapy against high PD-L1-expressing tumors in combination with ADCC through anti-PD-L1 mAbs.","Park, Ji-Eun; Kim, Seong-Eun; Keam, Bhumsuk; Park, Ha-Ram; Kim, Soyeon; Kim, Miso; Kim, Tae Min; Doh, Junsang; Kim, Dong-Wan; Heo, Dae Seog",Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,131,1

However, little is known about the morphological and phenotypical differences that a SCI could trigger in corticospinal neurons of the ipsilesional and contralesional hemisphere. Using an SMI-32 antibody which specifically labeled pyramidal neurons in cortical layers V, we investigated the impact of a unilateral cervical cord lesion on the rostral part (F6) and caudal part (F3) of the supplementary motor area (SMA) in both hemispheres of eight adult macaque monkeys compared with four intact control monkeys. We observed in F3 (but not in F6) interindividual variable and adaptive interhemispheric asymmetries of SMI-32 positive layer V neuronal density and dendritic arborization, which are strongly correlated with the extent of the SCI as well as the duration of functional recovery, but not with the extent (percentage) of functional recovery.Significance statement1. This study consists in a precise quantification on two different levels of the histological consequences on the long term of a traumatic and sudden unilateral interruption of the corticospinal tract at cervical level in 8 non-human primates (adult macaque monkeys).2. The lesion affected the density and the morphology of layer v pyramidal neurons in the supplementary motor area (SMA), in the form of an interhemispheric adaptive asymmetry, correlated to the lesion size and duration of functional recovery.3. These changes are reminiscent of those observed in SMA after unilateral lesion of the primary motor cortex, suggesting to some extent comparable mechanism of functional motor recovery from unilateral cortical or spinal lesion.4. The dendritic arborization in the basal dendrites of the SMI-32 positive neurons in layer V showed a more prominent interhemispheric effect of the lesion than the apical dendrites.","Contestabile, A; Colangiulo, R; Lucchini, M; Rouiller, E M; Schmidlin, E",eNeuro,131,1

In this scoping review we aimed to systematically collect the evidence on 1) the impact of common infections such as influenza, pneumonia and varicella zoster on frailty development, and 2) the role played by frailty in the response to immunization of older adults. Findings are discussed under a unifying framework to identify knowledge gaps and outline their clinical and public health implications to foster a healthier aging. Twenty-nine studies (113,863 participants) selected to answer the first question provided a moderately strong evidence of an association between infections and physical as well as cognitive decline - two essential dimensions of frailty. Thirteen studies (34,520 participants) investigating the second aim, showed that frailty was associated with an impaired immune response in older ages, likely due to immunosenescence. However, the paucity of studies, the absence of tools to predict vaccine efficacy, and the lack of studies investigating the efficacy of newer vaccines in presence of frailty, strongly limit the formulation of more personalized immunization strategies for older adults. The current evidence suggests that infections and frailty repeatedly cross each other pathophysiological paths and accelerate the aging process in a vicious circle. Such evidence opens to several considerations. First, the prevention of both conditions pass through a life course approach, which includes several individual and societal aspects. Second, the maintenance of a well-functioning immune system may be accomplished by preventing frailty, and vice versa. Third, increasing the adherence to immunization may delay the onset of frailty and maintain the immune system homeostasis, beyond preventing infections.","Vetrano, Davide L; Triolo, Federico; Maggi, Stefania; Malley, Richard; Jackson, Thomas A; Poscia, Andrea; Bernabei, Roberto; Ferrucci, Luigi; Fratiglioni, Laura",Ageing research reviews,131,19

Resurgences usually cause longer, broader and higher waves of infection, with greater threat to societies and economies compared to first waves. They may be caused by late implementation or early relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as social restrictions, ineffective interventions, or virus mutations. Here we provide quantitative evidence to characterize epidemiological differences between waves, evaluate possible causes, and predict potential trends under virus mutations. We use an event-driven dynamic epidemiological model embedded with time-dependent intervention interactions to compare two waves of COVID-19 outbreaks, and we quantify the impacts of control or relaxation interventions (called events) on wave patterns. We show the second waves in late 2020 in Germany, France and Italy could have been better contained by either carrying forward the effective interventions from their first waves or implementing better controls and timing. We also obtain the quantitative effects of enforcing or relaxing interventions on various transmissibility levels of coronavirus mutants (like delta or lambda) in the second waves and in the next 30 days. Comprehensive analyses at four levels - vertical (between waves), horizontal (across countries), what-if (scenario simulations on second waves) and future (30-day trend) - in the two 2020 waves in Germany, France and Italy show that (1) intervention fatigue (government and community reluctance to interventions), early relaxations and lagging interventions may be common reasons for the resurgences observed in many countries; (2) timely strong interventions such as full lockdown will contain resurgence; and (3) in the absence of sufficient vaccination, herd immunity and effective antiviral pharmaceutical treatments and with more infectious mutations, the widespread early or fast relaxation of interventions including public activity restrictions will result in a COVID-19 resurgence.","Cao, L.; Liu, Q.",,131,1

However, to achieve carbon neutrality effectively and efficiently market mechanisms allowing individuals and firms to internalize the environmental costs of their consumption and production behaviour are key. Therefore, in addition to the EU ETS, in 2021 Germany introduced a national carbon pricing scheme for the heating and transport sector.

Smartphone applications (app) are a promising, scalable approach to improving sleep among employees. In this randomized clinical trial, we evaluate the dayzz app, a personalized sleep training program that promotes healthy sleep and sleep disorders awareness through personalized, comprehensive sleep improvement solutions. In a sample of daytime employees affiliated with a large healthcare organization, we evaluated the dayzz app in a parallel-group, randomized, waitlist control trial. Participants were randomly assigned to either use the dayzz app throughout the study or the waitlist control condition where they would receive the dayzz app at the end of the study period. We collected data on employee sleep (e.g., sleep duration, sleep health behavioral changes); workplace outcomes (e.g., employee presenteeism, absenteeism, and performance); and healthcare utilization (e.g., mental health, ambulatory visits, and emergency room visits), throughout the study. Results show that those assigned to the experimental condition exhibited an increase in healthy sleep behaviors; an increase in sleep duration; a trend toward a more regular sleep schedule; and a significant increase in overall sleep quality. Regarding workplace outcomes, results showed that those in the experimental condition also demonstrated a trend toward less absenteeism and significantly lower presenteeism; and those in the experimental condition reported lower healthcare utilization.

In Europe, the use of wild edible plants is shifting from a subsistence activity to an emerging trend in high-end gastronomy. The environmental impacts of this shift are poorly known. Foraging is increasingly popular for personal consumption and commercially, not least in the Nordic countries where popularity is fuelled by the New Nordic Food movement. Here, we evaluate if this trend entails biodiversity conservation risks in Norway. In collaboration with the Norwegian Association for Mycology and Foraging, we conducted 18 face-to-face interviews with key stakeholders and we published an online questionnaire filled by 219 recreational and professional foragers. We enquired on what species are harvested, by whom and how, where do foragers learn and what are their perspectives on the sustainability of foraging. We combined these data with an assessment of foraging impact based on foraging pressure, ecological traits and conservation assessments. Our results show that 272 different wild edible plants are foraged and that this is mostly sustainable. However, some risks arise from the harvest of threatened plants, the potential spread of invasive species, and the overharvesting of extremely popular or ‘fashionable’ species. Foraging fosters a strong connection with the natural environment and the majority of foragers report to forage as part of a sustainable lifestyle. We suggest that careful encouragement to forage and the participatory development of local guidelines for sustainable foraging in Norway can enhance people-nature relationships while safeguarding foraged plant populations.","Giraud, Nicolas J.; Kool, Anneleen; Karlsen, Pål; Annes, Alexis; Teixidor-Toneu, Irene",bioRxiv,131,9

Now, accumulating evidence suggests greater involvement of lower age and narrowing the age and sex based differences for the severity of symptoms in infections with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Delta variant (B.1.617.2) is now a globally dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain, however, current evidence on demographic characteristics for this variant are limited. Recently, delta variant caused a devastating second wave of COVID-19 in India. We performed a demographic characterization of COVID-19 cases in Indian population diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing for delta variant. Objective: To determine demographic characteristics of delta variant in terms of age and sex, severity of the illness and mortality rate, and post-vaccination infections. Design: A cross sectional study Setting: Demographic characteristics, including vaccination status (for two complete doses) and severity of the illness and mortality rate, of COVID-19 cases caused by wild type strain (B.1) and delta variant (B.1.617.2) of SARS-CoV-2 in Indian population were studied. Participants: COVID-19 cases for which SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing was performed and complete demographic details (age, sex, and location) were available, were included. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection with Delta (B.1.617.2) variant and wild type (B.1) strain. Main Outcomes and Measures: The patient metadata containing details for demographic and vaccination status (two complete doses) of the COVID-19 patients with confirmed delta variant and WT (B.1) infections were analyzed [total number of cases (N) =9500, NDelta =6238, NWT=3262]. Further, severity of the illness and mortality were assessed in subsets of patients. Final data were tabulated and statistically analyzed to determine age and sex based differences in chances of getting infection and the severity of illness, and post-vaccination infections were compared between wild type and delta variant strains. Graphs were plotted to visualize the trends. Results: With delta variant, in comparison to wild type (B.1) strain, higher proportion of young age individuals (<20 year) (0-9 year: 4.47% vs. 2.3%, 10-19 year: 9% vs. 7%) were affected. The proportion of women contracting infection were increased (41% vs. 36%). The higher proportion of total young (0-19 year, 10% vs. 4%) (p=.017) population and young (14% vs. 3%) as well as adult (20-59 year, 75% vs. 55%) women developed symptoms/hospitalized with delta variant in comparison to B.1 infection (p< .00001). The mean age of contracting infection [Delta, men=37.9 (17.2) year, women=36.6 (17.6) year; B.1, men=39.6 (16.9) year and women= 40.1 (17.4) year (p<.001)] as well as developing symptoms/hospitalization [Delta, men=39.6(17.4) year, women=35.6(16.9) year; B.1, men=47(18) year and women= 49.5(20.9) year (p<.001)] was considerably lower. The total mortality was about 1.8 times higher (13% vs. 7%). Risk of death increased irrespective of the sex (Odds ratio: 3.034, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.7-5.2, p<0.001), however, increased proportion of women (32% vs. 25%) were demised. Further, multiple incidences of delta infections were noted following complete vaccination. Conclusions and Relevance: The increased involvement of young (0-19 year) and women, lower mean age for contracting infection and symptomatic illness/hospitalization, higher mortality, and frequent incidences of post-vaccination infections with delta variant compared to wild type strain raises significant epidemiological concerns.","Kumar, A.; Asghar, A.; Raza, K.; Narayan, R.

During the COVID-19 surge (April – June 2020) with centralization of paediatric surgical care and risks from anaesthetics to both patients and staff a NOM pathway was used to manage clinically diagnosed appendicitis in the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children (RBHSC). METHODS: Prospective data collection was undertaken of all children (<16 years) diagnosed with appendicitis who entered the NOM pathway in RBHSC from 01/04/2020 to 30/06/2020. This was compared to a cohort from the same timeframe in 2019. Primary end-points were inpatient success rate of NOM and 30-day success rate of NOM (success defined as no appendectomy performed). RESULTS: 47 patients completed the NOM pathway, with 43% (20/47) suspected to have complicated appendicitis. The cohort was similar to that of 2019 in terms of age (p=0.1) and sex (p=0.8), but was 155% larger (42 v. 20). For those with simple appendicitis, there was a 96% (26/27) success rate of NOM on discharge, with a 93% (25/27) 30-day success rate. For complicated appendicitis, there was a 40% (8/20) success rate on discharge, with a 30% (6/20) 30-day success rate. CONCLUSION: The use of a NOM pathway for paediatric appendicitis during the COVID-19 surge in Northern Ireland was safe and effective for staff and patients. With a small sample size and restricted follow up more evidence is required to prove if this is an effective treatment modality with a return to normal theatre availability. In the interests of antibiotic stewardship we would not advocate NOM pathways utilisation by non-surgical clinicians.","Colvin, D; Lawther, S",Ulster Med J,131,16

METHODS Clinical date of 30 SARS patients without other diseases in whom corticosteroid was used were reviewed including total dosage, duration of use, the highest dosage and its duration, and speed of reduction in dosage. The information about arthralgia was investigated one month after discharge of SARS patients from the hospital. RESULTS The average total dosage of methylprednisolone was (4 244.16+/-2 292.30) mg, and the duration of use of the treatment was (25.36+/-5.88) days (ranging from 12 to 35 days). The maximum dosage was (321.33+/-174.03) mg/d, and the duration of its use was (7.73+/-4.08) days. The speed of reduction of dosage of corticosteroids was (21.33+/-10.18) mg/d. There were 26 of 30 patients (86.67 percent) experienced arthralgia symptom during convalescence. In 3.6 percent of patients arthralgia occurred within one month after SARS, 53.85 percent of the patients experienced low-grade arthralgia. By unifactor analysis, the total dosage and its duration of use, the highest dosage and its duration, speed of reduction of dosage of corticosteroids were correlated with the degree of arthralgia, respectively. The duration of arthralgia was correlated with the total dosage, the duration of high dosage, and high dosage. Age was not correlated with either the degree or the persisting time of arthralgia. The degree of arthralgia was only correlated with the total dosage, and the duration of arthralgia was correlated with administration time of glucocorticosteroids by multifactor analysis. CONCLUSION There is a dosage- effect relation between the degree of arthralgia and the total dosage of corticosteroid, and a time-effect relation between the duration of arthralgia and length of the use of corticosteroids.","Gao, Hong-sheng; Wang, Shi-xin; Chen, Li-ming; Li, Yu-ming; Yuan, Shu-ling; Jiao, Zhen-shan; Hui, Wu-li; Yang, Zhen; Zhao, Zhi-yong",Zhongguo wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue = Chinese critical care medicine = Zhongguo weizhongbing jijiuyixue,131,9

The expressed Lse protein exhibits sialic-acid O-acetylesterase activity that is not attributable to a typical serine esterase active site. lse expression is spatially and temporally restricted during embryogenesis, and its mRNA levels correlate with differences in O-acetylesterase activity described in adult tissues and blood cell types. Using interspecific backcross analysis, we further mapped the lse gene to the central region of mouse chromosome 9. This constitutes the first report on the molecular cloning of a sialic acid-specific O-acetylesterase in vertebrates and suggests novel roles for the 9-O-acetyl modification of sialic acids during the development and differentiation of mammalian organisms.","Guimarães, M J; Bazan, J F; Castagnola, J; Diaz, S; Copeland, N G; Gilbert, D J; Jenkins, N A; Varki, A; Zlotnik, A",The Journal of biological chemistry,131,0

Since semen is widely disseminated for artificial insemination and the virus can cause significant health and economic consequences, it is essential to have well-validated, rapid diagnostic techniques to detect and quantitate the virus for diagnostic and research purposes. Previously, boar semen was tested by a nested PCR (nPCR) assay which was compared to the ""gold standard"" swine bioassay. A correlation of 94% was observed, indicating that, most of the time, PCR detected infectious virus. Subsequently, a real-time PCR targeting the 3' untranslated region of the PRRSV genome was compared with nPCR by testing 413 serum and semen samples from PRRSV-inoculated and control boars. There was 95% agreement between the results of the two tests, with the majority of samples with discordant results containing virus at the lower range of detection by the assays. The virus in all samples was quantitated by using a standard curve obtained by serial dilution of an in vitro transcript. By using the in vitro transcript, the lower limit of sensitivity was observed to be approximately 33 copies/ml. Reactivity with a panel of more than 100 PRRSV isolates from various geographical regions in the United States was also documented. No reactivity with nine nonrelated swine viruses was noted. A real-time PCR was also developed for the detection of the European Lelystad virus and the European-like PRRSV now found in the United States. In six of six PRRSV-inoculated boars, peak levels of viremia occurred at 5 days postinoculation (DPI) and were most consistently detectable throughout 22 DPI. In five of six boars, PRRSV was shed in semen for 0 to 2 days during the first 10 DPI; however, one of six boars shed the virus in semen through 32 DPI. Therefore, in general, the concentration and duration of PRRSV shedding in semen did not correlate with the quantity or duration of virus in serum. These differences warrant further studies into the factors that prevent viral replication in the reproductive tract.","Wasilk, A; Callahan, J D; Christopher-Hennings, J; Gay, T A; Fang, Y; Dammen, M; Reos, M E; Torremorell, M; Polson, D; Mellencamp, M; Nelson, E; Nelson, W M",Journal of clinical microbiology,131,28

This study aims to identify Burnout in physicians working in COVID ICU and isolation Ward. METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 physicians who had worked in either COVID ICU or Isolation ward. A survey of 23 questions was designed to assess the work-related Burnout using the Copenhagen burnout inventory and the implementation of NIH guidelines. RESULTS Among the 200 physicians, 151 (75.5%) were well informed of the guidelines, of which 52 (34.4%) participants believed the guidelines were not sufficient. These 34.4% of individuals showed a mean burnout score of 70.05% (p-value 0.001). Medical registrars and Medical Officers suffered the highest burnout mean percentage score of 76% and 72.42%, respectively. 89 (44.5%) individuals arranged PPE suits on their own and suffered a burnout score of 71.3% ±14.35 (p-value <0.001). Seventy-two (36%) claimed their administration was not cooperative in resolve safety issues. These individuals showed a mean burnout score of 74.3% ±13.82 (p-value <0.001). CONCLUSIONS Lack of physician's faith in the adequacy of the NIH guidelines has been found to be a significant factor in contributing to work-related Burnout. Due to the shortage of PPE, a majority of physicians have to reuse their PPE multiple times and even have to personally arrange their PPE suits, which further compounds the burnout. Increase administrative cooperation in resolving issues related to safety measures should help elevate work-related burnout in physicians working in the ICU and isolation ward.","Hussain, Mulazim; Amjad, Muhammad Bin; Ahsan, Juniad; Minhas, Shayan Omer","Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC",131,31

Unfortunately, the mechanism of coagulopathy is not clearly addressed. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of COVID-19 thrombosis and improving the coagulopathy through efficient treatment may help to stop disease progression, reduce mortality and sequelae. In severe COVID-19 patients, inflammation, cytokine storm, and coagulation are closely related, which together cause blood congestion and thrombosis. Many cytokines activate blood cells, expressing activating factors or releasing activated microparticles, and then accelerating thrombosis. However, the role of blood cells is not well understood in COVID-19 patients. In addition, cytokines stimulate endothelial cells, transforming them into a procoagulant phenotype. Therefore, determine their role and propose new strategies for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis in severe COVID-19 patients.

First studies describe a negative impact of pandemic stressors even on individuals without previous mental illnesses. The home lockdown and the shutdown of pain clinics make it difficult for all patients to get the healthcare they need. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent patients with chronic pain felt affected by the pandemic and its consequences on pain treatments, focussing on the beginning of the outbreak. STUDY DESIGN A prospective noninterventional study. SETTING Medical University Center . METHODS One-hundred and forty-nine patients, suffering from chronic pain, treated at a large German interdisciplinary pain center, were studied over a period of 2 months at the beginning of the pandemic. Data from patient charts and questionnaires were evaluated. Patients were asked about postponements or cancellations of pain therapy, the possible effect on pain levels, depression, anxiety and stress, and the impact of intensified hygiene measures. Results were compared to those from standardized and validated questionnaires from the same patients (German version of the depression, anxiety, and stress scale = DASS) at the time of the first contact in the pain clinic. RESULTS Eighty-four (56.4%) patients reported cancelled or postponed treatments during the pandemic. Those chronic pain patients with delayed or cancelled treatments reported significantly more pain and psychological distress. The delay or discontinuation of treatments resulted in a deterioration of symptoms. From the patients' point of view this deterioration was unrelated to the timing of treatment and not secondary to increased hygiene measures. In both groups, patients showed a significant amelioration of the DASS values compared to the values they had at the beginning of treatment, despite the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on care structures. The majority of the patients do not think that the quality of pain treatment was significantly affected by the intensified hygiene requirements. LIMITATIONS The limitations of the study are the small number of patients because of the limitation to a short period of time at the beginning of the pandemic and the return rate of 40.2% of the study consents. CONCLUSIONS Even in the event of a pandemic-related restriction of the care structures, patients with chronic pain benefit from pain therapy. Limitations such as the increased hygiene measures caused by the pandemic were not considered detrimental to the therapeutic measures.","Kleinmann, Barbara; Abberger, Birgit; Kieselbach, Kristin; Wolter, Tilman",Pain physician,131,31

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of these cost containment strategies on the PE of the NHI programme from 1996 to 2003. METHODS To take the growth and seasonal trends of monthly PE into consideration, Box and Tiao's time-series event intervention analysis based on the Box-Jenkins auto-regressive integrated moving-average model was applied to evaluate the impact of various cost containment strategies on total and subsector (outpatient, inpatient, clinic and hospital sectors) PE. Monthly data of PE of the NHI programme from 1996 to 2003 (the dependent variables) were obtained from the Bureau of the NHI. Drugs prescribed by dentists and Chinese medical doctors at outpatient departments were excluded. RESULTS After fitting the patterns of time series and controlling for the calendar effect of the Chinese New Year and the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, three strategies (generic grouping, delegation of financial responsibility and reduction of the flat payment rate of clinics) were significantly associated with a reduction in PE. However, the hospital global budget strategy offset partial savings from these three strategies. Cumulative savings during the study period were estimated to be NT25.442 dollars billion (US0.80 dollars billion). Of all the strategies, generic grouping was the most effective although it had less effect on the clinic subsector. Neither drug co-payment nor price adjustment based on the international or inter-brand price comparison had significant impacts on PE. CONCLUSION Generic grouping, reduction of the flat payment rate and delegation of financial responsibility were effective in controlling PE. A global budget alone would be unable to control PE without other direct financial incentives. Neither drug co-payment nor brand-specific price adjustment based on prices of international/existing products had a significant impact on PE.","Lee, Yue-Chune; Yang, Ming-Chin; Huang, Yu-Tung; Liu, Chien-Hsiang; Chen, Sun-Bing",PharmacoEconomics,131,1

Children under GA are at risk of decreases in body temperature. This risk may be greater during MRI due to MRI scanners requiring cool ambient temperatures. Conversely, radiofrequency radiation emitted by MRI scanners is absorbed by the patient as heat energy, creating a risk of an increase in body temperature. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of anaesthetised children undergoing an MRI scan who develop hyperthermia or hypothermia, and the risk factors associated with temperature changes in these children. Pre-scan and post-scan tympanic temperatures were obtained from 193 children (aged three months to six years) undergoing an MRI procedure under GA. No active warming or cooling devices were used during the MRI scans. The median duration for anaesthesia was 42 minutes (35 to 57 minutes). Fifty-two percent of children were hypothermic after their scan, while no subjects were hyperthermic after their scan. The mean (± standard deviation) pre-scan temperature was 36.2°C±0.5°C, and the mean (± standard deviation) post-scan temperature was 35.9°C±0.6°C (an overall mean temperature decrease of 0.28°C was observed [95% confidence interval, -0.36°C to -0.19°C], P <0.001). In conclusion, core body temperature was found to decrease slightly during an MRI scan under GA. These results suggest that more focus is needed regarding the cooling effects of GA agents during MRI, as opposed to the heating effects of the MRI scanner.","Lo, C; Ormond, G; McDougall, R; Sheppard, S J; Davidson, A J",Anaesthesia and intensive care,131,33

In addition, ongoing surveillance of the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus reveals outbreaks of human-to-human transmission of the virus, with significant mortality. Effective pandemic management depends on pharmaceutical intervention with two different clinical objectives: the generation of an immune response to specific viral strains (vaccination) and the reduction of viral replication in an infected individual (antiviral administration). The ability to offer pharmaceutical interventions for a public health crisis depends on three factors: development, capacity, and access. Pharmaceutical measures must be developed, capacity must be established, and access must be ensured. The article discusses the three nodes of patenting that influence the availability of pharmaceutical countermeasures in an influenza pandemic. Identification of the causative influenza virus is the first step in pandemic management and precedes vaccine design, and the virus and its RNA sequence are both knowledge assets and inputs for vaccine design. Vaccine development, therefore, will be influenced by any patents on the genetic sequences or proteins of the pandemic virus, as well as on novel methods for vaccine production, the actual vaccine or adjuvant technology, all of which are relevant to the assembly of a working vaccine on short notice. Pharmaceutical treatment of influenza infection during a pandemic could also rely on use of patented antiviral drugs, whose efficacy may be revealed as the pandemic unfolds. Unlike vaccines, these are not generally developed de novo for a pandemic, but their availability could be dependent on the exercise of patent rights by market incumbents. Patent rights could control capacity, which may determine access. Pandemic planning must consider how patenting can influence development, capacity and access to pharmaceutical interventions. The national and international public health authorities are slowly integrating intellectual property considerations into pandemic planning. Further integration will anticipate the emergence of patent claims, identify any relevant patents, encourage access norms, and consider the use of legal mechanisms that could alleviate patent-mediated obstacles to the availability of critical products and methods that may be patented. Pandemic management must also co-exist with existing efforts to control seasonal influenza outbreaks. The article analyzes the intersection of patent nodes relevant to vaccine development and to antiviral distribution during a global influenza pandemic, identifying where such patents may facilitate or inhibit the availability of pharmaceutical countermeasures, and offers preliminary observations on the emerging novel H1N1 pandemic. The goal of international clinical equality is essential for the eradication of an influenza pandemic, and strategies for its achievement can also be applied to other diseases.","Kane, Eileen M",Seton Hall law review,131,28

We argue that human rights offer a crucial framework for protecting the public from regulatory overreach by ensuring that digital health surveillance does not undermine fundamental features of democratic society. First, we describe the surveillance technologies being used to address COVID-19 and reposition these technologies within the evolution of public health surveillance tools and the emergence of discussions concerning the compatibility of such tools with human rights. We then evaluate the potential human rights implications of the surveillance tools being used today by analyzing the extent to which they pass the tests of necessity and proportionality enshrined in international human rights law.

Here we report that hepatitis C virus (HCV) triggers the appearance of SGs in a PKR- and interferon (IFN)-dependent manner. Moreover, we show an inverse correlation between the presence of stress granules and the induction of IFN-stimulated proteins, i.e., MxA and USP18, in HCV-infected cells despite high-level expression of the corresponding MxA and USP18 mRNAs, suggesting that interferon-stimulated gene translation is inhibited in stress granule-containing HCV-infected cells. Finally, in short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown experiments, we found that the stress granule proteins T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen 1 (TIA-1), TIA1-related protein (TIAR), and RasGAP-SH3 domain binding protein 1 (G3BP1) are required for efficient HCV RNA and protein accumulation at early time points in the infection and that G3BP1 and TIA-1 are required for intracellular and extracellular infectious virus production late in the infection, suggesting that they are required for virus assembly. In contrast, TIAR downregulation decreases extracellular infectious virus titers with little effect on intracellular RNA content or infectivity late in the infection, suggesting that it is required for infectious particle release. Collectively, these results illustrate that HCV exploits the stress granule machinery at least two ways: by inducing the formation of SGs by triggering PKR phosphorylation, thereby downregulating the translation of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes, and by co-opting SG proteins for its replication, assembly, and egress.","Garaigorta, Urtzi; Heim, Markus H; Boyd, Bryan; Wieland, Stefan; Chisari, Francis V",Journal of virology,131,9

Some FRI could cause large outbreaks of potentially life-threatening diseases (multi- or extensively drug resistant MTB, SARS, pandemic influenza) if not adequately controlled. Emergency Departments (EDs) are preferential sites of disease transmission because of the presence of both infectious and susceptible patients in the same space, the lack of rapid isolation of infectious patients, and the frequent and close contacts among patients and HCWs often not protected by PPE. The management of risk of FRI transmission is thus extremely important in EDs, where all procedures of infection control should be in place and continually monitored and assessed. In this article the main procedures for the management of risk of FRI transmission in EDs are described and discussed.","Puro, Vincenzo; Fusco, Francesco Maria; Lanini, Simone; Nisii, Carla; Ippolito, Giuseppe",The new microbiologica,131,7

ARDS is one of the fatal complications, highlighted by pulmonary infiltration and severe hypoxemia. This condition can be developed from primary lung inflammation caused by various viruses, particularly influenza viruses, some of the most common human pathogens. Due to this issue, many studies explored several approaches for ARDS treatment. Lung transplantation has been claimed as an efficient cure for severe ARDS and Influenza, which can also be offered for treating critical lung complications of SARS-CoV-2. Thereupon, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, we aimed to review all available data about capability of lung transplantation for the treatment of critically ill patients with ARDS, Influenza, and SARS-CoV-2.","Khozani, Reyhaneh Shams; Shekouh, Dorsa; Hosseini, Sayyed Amirreza; Torbati, Mehrnush Saghab; Noorian, Mahsa; Rabiei, Reyhaneh; Mohseni, Qazal; Rad, Hossein Rostami; Bojd, Shakiba Shaterzadeh; Hosseini, Parastoo; Ansari, Arina; Godazandeh, Kimia; Deravi, Niloofar",Acta medica Indonesiana,131,31

One is a fitting function that can be calibrated to reproduce an epidemic curve with two timescales (e.g., fast growth and slow decay). The other is a compartmental model that accounts for quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, a non-exponentially distributed incubation period, asymptomatic individuals, and mild and severe forms of symptomatic disease. Using Bayesian inference, we have been calibrating our models daily for consistency with new reports of confirmed cases from the 15 most populous metropolitan statistical areas in the United States and quantifying uncertainty in parameter estimates and predictions of future case reports. This online learning approach allows for early identification of new trends despite considerable variability in case reporting.

According to World Health Organisation (WHO) this appears to be the first severe and easily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century. Though much about the disease remains poorly understood, including the details of the causative virus, we do know that it has features that allow it to spread rapidly along international air travel routes.

Here we observed that transient expression of 3a inhibited cell growth and prevented 5-bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, suggesting that 3a deregulated cell cycle progression. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that 3a expression was associated with blockage of cell cycle progression at G1 phase in HEK 293, COS-7, and Vero cells 24-60 h after transfection. Mutation analysis of 3a revealed that C-terminal region (176 aa approximately 274 aa), including a potential calcium ATPase motif, was essential for induction of cell cycle arrest. Topological analysis showed that 3a predominantly located in Golgi apparatus, with its N-terminus residing in the lumen (Nlum) and C-terminus in the cytosol (Ccyt). Analyzing the cellular proteins involving in regulation of cell cycle progression, we demonstrated that 3a expression was correlated with a significant reduction of cyclin D3 level and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein at Ser-795 and Ser-809/811, not with the expression of cyclin D1, D2, cdk4, and cdk6 in 293 cells. Increases in p53 phosphorylation on Ser-15 were observed in both SARS-CoV M and 3a transfected cells, suggesting that it might not correlate with the 3a-induced G0/G1 phase arrest. The reduction of cyclin D3 level and phosphorylation of Rb were further confirmed in SARS-CoV infected Vero cells. These results indicate that SARS-CoV 3a protein, through limiting the expression of cyclin D3, may inhibit Rb phosphorylation, which in turn leads to a block in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and an inhibition of cell proliferation.","Yuan, Xiaoling; Yao, Zhenyu; Wu, Jie; Zhou, Yusen; Shan, Yajun; Dong, Bo; Zhao, Zhenhu; Hua, Ping; Chen, Jiapei; Cong, Yuwen",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,131,30

Its causative agent, Toxoplasma gondii, is a facultatively heteroxenous, polyxenous protozoon that has developed several potential routes of transmission within and between different host species. If first contracted during pregnancy, T. gondii may be transmitted vertically by tachyzoites that are passed to the foetus via the placenta. Horizontal transmission of T. gondii may involve three life-cycle stages, i.e. ingesting infectious oocysts from the environment or ingesting tissue cysts or tachyzoites which are contained in meat or primary offal (viscera) of many different animals. Transmission may also occur via tachyzoites contained in blood products, tissue transplants, or unpasteurised milk. However, it is not known which of these routes is more important epidemiologically. In the past, the consumption of raw or undercooked meat, in particular of pigs and sheep, has been regarded as a major route of transmission to humans. However, recent studies showed that the prevalence of T. gondii in meat-producing animals decreased considerably over the past 20 years in areas with intensive farm management. For example, in several countries of the European Union prevalences of T. gondii in fattening pigs are now <1%. Considering these data it is unlikely that pork is still a major source of infection for humans in these countries. However, it is likely that the major routes of transmission are different in human populations with differences in culture and eating habits. In the Americas, recent outbreaks of acute toxoplasmosis in humans have been associated with oocyst contamination of the environment. Therefore, future epidemiological studies on T. gondii infections should consider the role of oocysts as potential sources of infection for humans, and methods to monitor these are currently being developed. This review presents recent epidemiological data on T. gondii, hypotheses on the major routes of transmission to humans in different populations, and preventive measures that may reduce the risk of contracting a primary infection during pregnancy.","Tenter, A M; Heckeroth, A R; Weiss, L M",International journal for parasitology,131,15

It currently manages biological data for three projects-the CATH protein domain database (Orengo et al., 1997; Pearl et al., 2001), the VIDA virus domains database (Albà et al., 2001) and the Gene3D database (Buchan et al., 2001). The PFDB has been designed to accommodate protein families identified by a variety of sequence based or structure based protocols and provides a generic resource for biological research by enabling mapping between different protein families and diverse biochemical and genetic data, including complete genomes. RESULTS A characteristic feature of the PFDB is that it has a number of meta-level entities (for example aggregation, collection and inclusion) represented as base tables in the final design. The explicit representation of relationships at the meta-level has a number of advantages, including flexibility-both in terms of the range of queries that can be formulated and the ability to integrate new biological entities within the existing design. A potential drawback with this approach-poor performance caused by the number of joins across meta-level tables-is avoided by implementing the PFDB with materialized views using the mature relational database technology of Oracle 8i. The resultant database is both fast and flexible. This paper presents the principles on which the database has been designed and implemented, and describes the current status of the database and query facilities supported.","Shepherd, Adrian J; Martin, Nigel J; Johnson, Roger G; Kellam, Paul; Orengo, Christine A",Bioinformatics,131,1

Background NLR and CRP are established markers that reflect systemic inflammatory, and these parameters alter in patients with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia (COVID-19). Methods A population of patients with COVID-19 referred to Loghman Hospital in Tehran was analyzed. The baseline data of laboratory examinations, including NLR and CRP levels, was collected. Pearson analysis was used to assess the independent relationship between the NLR with disease severity and CRP levels. Results COVID-19 cases comprised 14 (20%) patients with severe disease and 56 (80%) with non-severe infection. The mean values of WBC, NEU, LYM, and NLR of the severe patients were significantly higher than those of the non-severe patients. Forty-six patients (65.7%) had NLR >1, and the remaining patients had NLR <1. Plasma CRP levels were higher in severe cases than in non-severe cases, and this difference was significant. The results showed that NLR was positively correlated with CRP levels (R=0.23) and negatively correlated with WBC (R=-0.38). CRP (AUC = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99) and NLR (AUC = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.81-0.93) had very good accuracy in predicting the severity of COVID-19 disease.

OBJECTIVE The objective was to study the effects of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) on heme- and nonheme-iron absorption and iron status. DESIGN Fifty-eight menstruating women were enrolled in this prospective study [mean (±SD) age: 35.9 ± 9.1 y; weight: 101.7 ± 13.5 kg; BMI (in kg/m²): 39.9 ± 4.4]. Anthropometric, body-composition, dietary, and hematologic indexes and heme- and nonheme-iron absorption-using a standardized meal containing 3 mg Fe-were determined before and 12 mo after surgery. Forty-three subjects completed the 12-mo follow-up. Iron supplements were strictly controlled. RESULTS Heme-iron absorption was 23.9% before and 6.2% 12 mo after surgery (P < 0.0001). Nonheme-iron absorption decreased from 11.1% to 4.7% (P < 0.0001). No differences were observed by type of surgery. Iron intakes from all sources of supplements were 27.9 ± 6.2 mg/d in the SG group and 63.2 ± 21.1 mg/d in the RYGBP group (P < 0.001). Serum ferritin and total-body iron decreased more after RYGBP than after SG. CONCLUSIONS Iron (heme and nonheme) absorption is markedly reduced after SG and RYGBP. The magnitude of the decrease in heme-iron absorption is greater than that of nonheme iron. The amounts suggested as iron supplements may need to be increased to effectively prevent iron-status impairment.","Ruz, Manuel; Carrasco, Fernando; Rojas, Pamela; Codoceo, Juana; Inostroza, Jorge; Basfi-Fer, Karen; Valencia, Alejandra; Csendes, Attila; Papapietro, Karin; Pizarro, Fernando; Olivares, Manuel; Westcott, Jamie L; Hambidge, K Michael; Krebs, Nancy F",The American journal of clinical nutrition,131,1

In this article, we describe our experience over an eight-week period (16 March through 10 May 2020), and describe three types of services: clinical ethics consultation (CEC); service practice communications/interventions (SPCI); and organizational ethics advisement (OEA). We tell this narrative through the prism of time, describing the evolution of ethical issues and trends as the pandemic unfolded. We delineate three phases: anticipation and preparation, crisis management, and reflection and adjustment. The first phase focused predominantly on ways to address impending resource shortages and to plan for remote ethics consultation, and CECs focused on code status discussions with surrogates. The second phase was characterized by the dramatic convergence of a rapid increase in the number of critically ill patients, a growing scarcity of resources, and the reassignment/redeployment of staff outside their specialty areas. The third phase was characterized by the recognition that while the worst of the crisis was waning, its medium- and long-term consequences continued to pose immense challenges. We note that there were times during the crisis that serving in the role of clinical ethics consultant created a sense of dis-ease as novel as the coronavirus itself. In retrospect we learned that our activities far exceeded the familiar terrain of clinical ethics consultation and extended into other spheres of organizational life in novel ways that were unanticipated before this pandemic.

METHODS The usage of corticosteroids in 43 SARS patients were reviewed. The initial dosage and the highest dosage of prednisolone were investigated. RESULTS According to the dosage of the early 3 days, the initial dosage was calculated. The initial methyprednisonlone dosage was (170.82 +/- 15.89) mg.d-1, from 48 to 500 mg.d-1. The maximal dosage was (291.44 +/- 37.63) mg.d-1 (48-800 mg.d-1). Four patients recovered without corticosteroides therapy. Initial therapy was kept in 25 cases. Two had hyperglycemia, one of whom died of hyperosmotic coma and renal failure. 14 cases were not responsive and needed to increase the dosage of corticosteroids. 9 of them accepted pulse dosage therapy and acquired good outcome. None in the group had significant side effect. The severity of patients of the two groups had no significant difference. Those of nonresponsiveness had higher dosage and needed longer time to reach stable. CONCLUSION Sub-pulse dosage of methyprednisolone was effective for most SARS patients. Those who were less responsiveness might due to their poor sensitiveness to corticosteroids instead of SARS severity. Pulse treatment might be safe in carefully selected patients.","Li, Nan; Ma, Jing; Nie, Ligong; Li, Haichao; Que, Chengli; Gao, Zhidong; Wang, Guangfa; Xu, Xiaoyuan; Lu, Haiying; Wang, Guiqiang",Beijing da xue xue bao.

Patients on immunosuppressive therapy with COVID-19 had increased mortality (30% vs. 17%, p = 0.036; odds ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.11-4.04), which remained significant (p = 0.040) after performing multivariate logistic regression controlling for gender, age, race, and comorbidity status. Laboratory markers of inflammation were uniformly elevated in both patients on or not on immunosuppressive therapies who died, but lymphocytes and neutrophils were decreased in both COVID-19 patients on immunosuppressive therapies who died and who remained alive. These findings demonstrate that COVID-19 disease is more severe in patients taking prior immunosuppressive medications.

Sepsis, a life-threatening condition that arises when the body responds to infection, is currently the major cause of death in intensive care units (ICU). Although progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology of sepsis, many drawbacks in sepsis treatment remains unresolved. For example, antimicrobial resistance, controversial of glucocorticoids use, prolonged duration of ICU care and the subsequent high cost of the treatment. Recent years have witnessed a growing trend of applying traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in sepsis management. The TCM application emphasizes use of herbal formulation to balance immune responses to infection, which include clearing heat and toxin, promoting blood circulation and removing its stasis, enhancing gastrointestinal function, and strengthening body resistance. In this paper, we will provide an overview of the current status of Chinese herbal formulations, single herbs, and isolated compounds, as an add-on therapy to the standard Western treatment in the sepsis management. With the current trajectory of worldwide pandemic eruption of newly identified Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), the adjuvant TCM therapy can be used in the ICU to treat critically ill patients infected with the novel coronavirus.","Fan, Tian-Tian; Cheng, Bao-Li; Fang, Xiang-Ming; Chen, Yong-Can; Su, Fan",Am J Chin Med,131,9

As per available data, 80% of the patients experience mild disease, 20% need hospital admission, and about 5% require intensive care. To date, several modes of transmission such as droplet, contact, airborne, blood borne, and fomite have been described as plausible. Several studies have demonstrated shedding of the virus from patients after being free from symptoms, i.e. prolonged virus shedding. While few studies demonstrated virus shedding in convalescent patients, i.e. those testing negative for presence of virus on nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs, yet virus shedding was reported from other sources. Maximum duration of conversion time reported among the included studies was 60 days, while the least duration was 3 days. Viral shedding from sources other than nasopharynx and oropharynx, like stools, urine, saliva, semen, and tears, was reported. More number of studies described virus shedding from gastrointestinal tract (mainly in stools), while least a number of cases tested positive for the virus in tears. Prolonged viral shedding is important to consider while discontinuing isolation procedures and/or discharging SARS-CoV-2 patients. The risk of transmission varies in magnitude and depends on the infectivity of the shed virus in biological samples and the patient population involved. Clinical decision-making should be governed by clinical scenario, guidelines, detectable viral load, source of detectable virus, infectivity, and patient-related factors.","Karia, Rutu; Nagraj, Sanjana",SN Compr Clin Med,131,21

But this definition depends only on the chemical composition of a HEA and therefore cannot distinguish the information content that is encoded in various local atomic arrangements and measurable by the Shannon entropy in information theory. Here, inspired by the finding that two-dimensional (2D) Sudoku matrices exhibit higher average Shannon entropy than 2D random matrix counterparts, we propose high-Shannon-entropy alloys (HSEA), whose structures are based on 3D Sudoku matrices. Despite the constraints on the atomic arrangements to form a 3D Sudoku 4 x 4 x 4 matrix, we find that, a prototypical HSEA, NbMoTaW has a lower energy than the same HEA with a random structure due to the smaller lattice distortion. We compute the electronic structures and mechanical properties and find that the HSEA exhibits enhanced average Fermi velocity and ductility over the random NbMoTaW HEA. Finally, we evaluate the formation energies of single vacancies and a vacancy cluster in the HSEA, whose configurations mimic Sudoku puzzles with one and several missing numbers, respectively. We find that a range of large energies are required to generate such vacancies, which depend on the location and species of missing atoms. Our work shows that introducing the Shannon entropy to HEAs offers a useful metric to reveal more atomic details of HEAs and that HSEAs represent an uncharted domain in the complicated energy landscape of HEAs which may be endowed with improved properties.","Zhuang, Houlong",,131,32

However, platforms such as Facebook and Twitter continue to pose unique challenges for clinical healthcare providers and public health officials alike. In order to effectively communicate during public health emergencies such as Covid-19, it's increasingly critical for healthcare providers and public health officials to understand how patients gather - and adjudicate the merits of - health-related information online. OBJECTIVE: With that goal in mind, we conducted a survey of 1,003 U.S.-based adults to better understand how health consumers have utilized social media to learn and stay informed about the Covid-19 pandemic, including the extent to which they've relied on credible scientific information sources and how they've gone about ""fact-checking"" pandemic related information. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted via sample purchased through an industry leading market research provider. Results are reported with a 95% confidence level and a margin of error of +/- 3. Participants included 1,003 U.S.-based adults (18 or older). Participants were selected via a stratified quota sampling approach to ensure a representative sample of the U.S. population. Balanced quotas were determined (by region of the country) for gender, age, race, ethnicity. RESULTS: The results show a heavy reliance on social media during the Covid-19 pandemic, with more than three quarters of respondents (76%) saying that they have relied on social media a least ""a little"", and nearly 60% of respondents indicating that they read information about Covid-19 on social media at least once a week. According to the findings, most social media users are unlikely to ""fact-check"" what they see online with a health professional, despite reporting high levels of mistrust in the accuracy of Covid-related information on social media. We also find a greater likelihood of vaccination among those ""following"" more credible, scientific sources on social media during the pandemic (X2 = 50.790; &#966; = 0.258; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that health professionals will need to be both strategic and proactive when engaging with health consumers on social media if they hope to counteract the deleterious effects of erroneous misinformation (as well as malicious disinformation). Effective training, institutional support, and proactive collaboration can help health professionals adapt to evolving patterns of health information seeking.","Neely, Stephen; Eldredge, Christina; Sanders, Ron",J. med. internet res,131,20

It can be estimated relatively directly by testing of random population samples. Without such direct epidemiological measurement, other approaches are required to infer whether the number of new cases is likely to be increasing or decreasing: for example, estimating the pathogen-effective reproduction number, R, using data gathered from the clinical response to the disease. For coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19/SARS-Cov-2), such R estimation is heavily dependent on modelling assumptions, because the available clinical case data are opportunistic observational data subject to severe temporal confounding. Given this difficulty, it is useful to retrospectively reconstruct the time course of infections from the least compromised available data, using minimal prior assumptions. A Bayesian inverse problem approach applied to UK data on first-wave Covid-19 deaths and the disease duration distribution suggests that fatal infections were in decline before full UK lockdown (24 March 2020), and that fatal infections in Sweden started to decline only a day or two later. An analysis of UK data using the model of Flaxman et al. gives the same result under relaxation of its prior assumptions on R, suggesting an enhanced role for non-pharmaceutical interventions short of full lockdown in the UK context. Similar patterns appear to have occurred in the subsequent two lockdowns.","Wood, Simon N",Biometrics,131,1

Since COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, several drug regimens have rapidly undergone clinical trials for the management of COVID-19. However, one of the major issues is drug-induced organ injury, which is a prominent clinical challenge. Unfortunately, most drugs used against COVID-19 are associated with adverse effects in different organs, such as the kidney, heart, and liver. These side effects are dangerous and, in some cases, they can be lethal. More importantly, organ injury is also a clinical manifestation of COVID-19 infection. These adverse reactions are increasingly recognized as outcomes of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the differential diagnosis of drug-induced adverse effects from COVID-19-induced organ injury is a clinical complication. This review highlights the importance of drug-induced organ injury, its known mechanisms, and the potential therapeutic strategies in COVID-19 pharmacotherapy. We review the potential strategies for the differential diagnosis of drug-induced organ injury.

METHODS: We retrospectively collected 147 clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients at Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital of Hubei, China. We analyzed the coagulation function in COVID-19 patients through the data including thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), &#945;2-plasmininhibitor-plasmin Complex (PIC), thrombomodulin (TM), t-PA/PAI-1 Complex (t-PAIC), prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (FIB), thrombin time (TT), D-Dimer (DD), and platelet (PLT). RESULT: The levels of TAT, PIC, TM, t-PAIC, PT, INR, FIB, and DD in COVID-19 patients were higher than health controls (p<0.05), and also higher in the patients with thrombotic disease than without thrombotic disease (p<0.05). What's more, the patients with thrombotic disease had a higher case-fatality (p<0.05). TAT, PIC, TM, t-PAIC, PT, INR, APTT, FIB, DD, and PLT were also found correlated with disease severity. Meanwhile, we found that there were significant difference in TAT, TM, t-PAIC, PT, INR, APTT, DD, and PLT in the death and survival group. Further using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis also found that t-PAIC and DD were independent risk factors for death in patients and are excellent predicting the mortality risk of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Most COVID-19 patients with inordinate coagulation systems, dynamic monitoring of coagulation parameters might be a key in the control of COVID-19 death.","Jin, Xin; Duan, Yongwei; Bao, Tengfei; Gu, Junjuan; Chen, Yawen; Li, Yuanyuan; Mao, Shi; Chen, Yongfeng; Xie, Wen",PLoS One,131,16

(Special Issue: Diagnostic testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and lessons from this pandemic.),12.679564,12.994888,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus outbreak has demonstrated the crucial effect of the public's compliance with the government's health instructions on the population's health. However, evidence shows that some communities are less likely to comply with such instructions than others. This study highlights the factors related to intentions to comply with newly issued health directives during an ongoing extreme crisis, such as the current pandemic. In addition, it compares the impact of these factors on different minority groups and the general population in Israel. METHODS: Using an online survey (N=1005), we examined the impact of compliance-related factors on compliance intentions with newly issued health directives in two minority groups in Israel: the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community (N=323) and the Arab community (N=361), as well as in the general population (N=321), during the first outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Participants were presented with a new made-up COVID-19-related instruction simulated to be issued by the Israeli Ministry of Health. Compliance intentions and compliance-related factors were measured. RESULTS: The Arab minority expressed greater intentions of complying with the instructions than the other groups. Perceptions on risk and the effectiveness of the instruction were the only two significantly associated factors with compliance intentions in all of the social groups. Additional factors affected different groups to different extents. Trust in government was related to compliance intentions only in the Arab minority. CONCLUSION: Intentions to comply with health instructions during a crisis differ in various minority groups and in comparison to the general population, both in their levels and in the factors related to them. Policy-makers and health authorities should consider providing information about the risks and negative outcomes of the crisis as well as the expected effectiveness of the recommended behaviors.

RESULTS: A total of 73 severe patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 20 (27%) patients died in hospital during the average 28 days of follow-up period. The median age of non-survivors was significantly older than survivors (69 [64-76.5] years vs 64 [56-71.3] years, P = .033) and 15 (75%) patients were males. The laboratory abnormalities of non-survivors mainly presented in serious inflammation response and multiple organ failure, with high levels of cytokines and deranged coagulation parameters. Multivariable regression showed that neutrophil count greater than 4.47 × 109 /L (OR, 58.35; 95%CI: 2.16-1571.69; P = .016), hypersensitivity C-reactive protein greater than 86.7 mg/L (OR, 14.90; 95%CI: 1.29-171.10; P = .030), creatine kinase greater than 101 U/L (OR, 161.62; 95%CI: 6.45-4045.20; P = .002), and blood urea nitrogen greater than 6.7 mmol/L (OR, 11.18; 95%CI: 1.36-91.62; P = .024) were risk factors for in-hospital death.

Methods An S-I-R (susceptible-infectious-resolved) model is used to estimate the likely benefits of a suppression COVID-19 response compared to a herd immunity alternative. Direct impacts of the virus are calculated on the basis of sick leave, hospitalizations, and fatalities, while indirect impacts related to response actions are excluded. Results Preliminary modeling indicates that approximately 1700 vulnerable person deaths are likely to have been prevented over 1 year from adopting a suppression response rather than a herd immunity response, and approximately 4500 hospitalizations. These benefits are valued at around AUD4.7 billion. If a do nothing policy had been adopted, the number of people in need of hospitalization is likely to have overwhelmed the hospital system within 50?days of the virus being introduced. Maximum hospital capacity is unlikely to be reached in either a suppression policy or a herd immunity policy. Conclusion Using early international estimates to represent the negative impact each type of policy response is likely to have on gross state product, results suggest the benefit?cost ratio for the suppression policy is slightly higher than that of the herd immunity policy, but both benefit?cost ratios are less than one.","Cook, David C.; Fraser, Rob W.; McKirdy, Simon J.",Health Science Reports,131,9

Online schooling was associated with less trauma and generalized anxiety symptoms in children than school non-attendance. Screen-based activities were not directly associated with children’s trauma and anxiety symptoms, but the way parents coped with pandemic stressors moderated these associations. Parents’ active and adaptive coping strategies mitigated the effects of school non-attendance and increased screen-based activity use on children’s COVID-19-related symptoms.

Gadaba's religious life reflected through their rich folk traditions of songs, dance, music, rituals and festivals celebrated round the year adds colourful dimensions to their very existence. The amazing conglomeration of traditions, beliefs, sorrows and philosophies that together constitute and vitalize the religion of tribes has descended from antiquity and has been preserved unimpaired to the present day. Every dimension of their life covering round the year activities is intimately connected with religion and the world view associated with it. It is these aspects of their culture that give meaning and depth to their lives and solidarity to their social structure. However, in recent days many changes have been taken place in traditional religious life of Gadaba tribe. Against this backdrop, this paper has tried to explore some of that core structure of Gadaba's religious life as well as the changing dimensions of their religious manifestation.","Padhi, Soubhagya Ranjan",,131,16

However, use of these therapies, if ineffective, might delay initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in some patients. We aimed to determine early predictors of NIRS failure and develop a simple nomogram and online calculator that can identify patients at risk of NIRS failure. METHODS: We did a retrospective, multicentre observational study in 23 hospitals designated for patients with COVID-19 in China. Adult patients (&#8805;18 years) with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and acute respiratory failure receiving NIRS were enrolled. A training cohort of 652 patients (21 hospitals) was used to identify early predictors of NIRS failure, defined as subsequent need for IMV or death within 28 days after intensive care unit admission. A nomogram was developed by multivariable logistic regression and concordance statistics (C-statistics) computed. C-statistics were validated internally by cross-validation in the training cohort, and externally in a validation cohort of 107 patients (two hospitals). FINDINGS: Patients were enrolled between Jan 1 and Feb 29, 2020. NIV failed in 211 (74%) of 286 patients and HFNC in 204 (56%) of 366 patients in the training cohort. NIV failed in 48 (81%) of 59 patients and HFNC in 26 (54%) of 48 patients in the external validation cohort. Age, number of comorbidities, respiratory rate-oxygenation index (ratio of pulse oximetry oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen to respiratory rate), Glasgow coma scale score, and use of vasopressors on the first day of NIRS in the training cohort were independent risk factors for NIRS failure. Based on the training dataset, the nomogram had a C-statistic of 0·80 (95% CI 0·74-0·85) for predicting NIV failure, and a C-statistic of 0·85 (0·82-0·89) for predicting HFNC failure. C-statistic values were stable in both internal validation (NIV group mean 0·79 [SD 0·10], HFNC group mean 0·85 [0·07]) and external validation (NIV group value 0·88 [95% CI 0·72-0·96], HFNC group value 0·86 [0·72-0·93]). INTERPRETATION: We have developed a nomogram and online calculator that can be used to identify patients with COVID-19 who are at risk of NIRS failure. These patients might benefit from early triage and more intensive monitoring.

Such differences in views can be a source of misunderstanding, leading to unintended side effects. Online open-ended surveys resulted in 1341 comments received from 210 university educators and 347 students. The coding, based on the principles of Grounded Theory, resulted in 35 concepts, organized into 6 categories. The main findings were that students and educators shared most of the negative and positive views; however, there exist unique views that are not shared between the two groups. The negative views outweigh the positive ones, and educators are more negative than students. The category 'Perceived usefulness' is the most positive and 'Technology' the most negative category. Positive views were attributed to the quality of life, not the quality of the study. The most important contribution of the work to the existing body of knowledge is the comparative analysis of the unconstrained views of students and their educators about Online Learning Environments (OLE) as the workhorse of Forced Online Distance Education (FODE). The results of this study can be helpful for institutional evaluators, since they reveal undesirable side effects that are usually overlooked.

METHOD: A total of 1871 patients recorded in TReasure registry for whom advanced therapy was prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or spondyloarthritis (SpA) within the 3 months (6-9 months for rituximab) before the declaration of COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated and 1394 (74.5%) responded the survey performed by phone call. Patients? data regarding demographic, clinical characteristics and disease activity before the pandemic were recorded. The patients were inquired for the diagnosis of COVID-19, the rate of continuation on bDMARDs, the reasons for treatment discontinuation, if any, and the current general disease activity (visual analog scale, [VAS]). RESULTS: A total of 1,394 patients (493 RA [47.3% on anti-TNF] patients and 901 SpA [90.0% on anti-TNF] patients) were included. Overall, 2.8% of the patients had symptoms suggesting COVID-19, and 2 (0.15%) patients had polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed COVID-19. Overall, 18.1% of all patients (13.8% of the RA and 20.5% of the SpA; p=0.003) discontinued their bDMARDs. In the SpA group, the patients who discontinued bDMARDs were younger (40 [21-73] vs. 44 years [20-79]; p=0.005) and had higher general disease activity; however, no difference was relevant for RA patients. CONCLUSION: Although the COVID-19 was quite uncommon in the first 100 days of the pandemic, nearly one-fifth of the patients discontinued bDMARDs within this period.

However, emerging evidence indicates that a small but growing number of COVID-19 patients also manifest neurological symptoms, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may infect the nervous system under some circumstances. SARS-CoV-2 primarily enters the body through the epithelial lining of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, but under certain conditions this pleiotropic virus may also infect peripheral nerves and gain entry into the central nervous system (CNS). The brain is shielded by various anatomical and physiological barriers, most notably the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which functions to prevent harmful substances, including pathogens and pro-inflammatory mediators, from entering the brain. The BBB is composed of highly specialized endothelial cells, pericytes, mast cells and astrocytes that form the neurovascular unit, which regulates BBB permeability and maintains the integrity of the CNS. In this review, potential routes of viral entry and the possible mechanisms utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to penetrate the CNS, either by disrupting the BBB or infecting the peripheral nerves and using the neuronal network to initiate neuroinflammation, are briefly discussed. Furthermore, the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the brain and in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases known to be associated with other human coronaviruses are considered. Although the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the CNS and neurovirulence are currently unknown, the potential pathways described here might pave the way for future research in this area and enable the development of better therapeutic strategies.","Alam, S B; Willows, S; Kulka, M; Sandhu, J K",Eur. j. neurol,131,20

Determining the level of disaster preparedness of hospitals is an important and necessary issue. This is because identifying hospitals with low level of preparedness is crucial for disaster preparedness planning. In this study, a hybrid fuzzy decision making model was proposed to evaluate the disaster preparedness of hospitals. This model was developed using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP)-fuzzy decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL)-technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions (TOPSIS) techniques and aimed to determine a ranking for hospital disaster preparedness. FAHP is used to determine weights of six main criteria (including hospital buildings, equipment, communication, transportation, personnel, flexibility) and a total of thirty-six sub-criteria regarding disaster preparedness. At the same time, FDEMATEL is applied to uncover the interdependence between criteria and sub-criteria. Finally, TOPSIS is used to obtain ranking of hospitals. To provide inputs for TOPSIS implementation, some key performance indicators are established and related data is gathered by the aid of experts from the assessed hospitals. A case study considering 4 hospitals from the Turkish healthcare sector was used to demonstrate the proposed approach. The results evidenced that Personnel is the most important factor (global weight = 0.280) when evaluating the hospital preparedness while Flexibility has the greatest prominence (c + r = 23.09).","Ortiz-Barrios, Miguel; Gul, Muhammet; López-Meza, Pedro; Yucesan, Melih; Navarro-Jiménez, Eduardo",Int.

The first case of COVID-19 in New York City was officially confirmed on 1 March 2020 followed by a severe local epidemic1. Here, to understand seroprevalence dynamics, we conduct a retrospective, repeated cross-sectional analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies in weekly intervals from the beginning of February to July 2020 using more than 10,000 plasma samples from patients at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. We describe the dynamics of seroprevalence in an 'urgent care' group, which is enriched in cases of COVID-19 during the epidemic, and a 'routine care' group, which more closely represents the general population. Seroprevalence increased at different rates in both groups; seropositive samples were found as early as mid-February, and levelled out at slightly above 20% in both groups after the epidemic wave subsided by the end of May. From May to July, seroprevalence remained stable, suggesting lasting antibody levels in the population. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 was introduced in New York City earlier than previously documented and describe the dynamics of seroconversion over the full course of the first wave of the pandemic in a major metropolitan area.","Stadlbauer, Daniel; Tan, Jessica; Jiang, Kaijun; Hernandez, Matthew M; Fabre, Shelcie; Amanat, Fatima; Teo, Catherine; Arunkumar, Guha Asthagiri; McMahon, Meagan; Capuano, Christina; Twyman, Kathryn; Jhang, Jeffrey; Nowak, Michael D; Simon, Viviana; Sordillo, Emilia Mia; van Bakel, Harm; Krammer, Florian",Nature (Lond.),131,16

Platelets first contact invading pathogens and then induce immune reactions in cooperation with white blood cells. Platelet polyphosphate (polyP), which is classically recognized as a thrombotic and hemostatic biomolecule, has recently attracted attention as a cytokine that modulates inflammation and is involved in intercellular communication between platelets and major immune cells. ObjectiveTo determine the involvement of polyP in SARS-Cov-2-mRNA vaccine-induced immune responses, this pilot study examined the effects of mRNA vaccines on platelet polyP levels. MethodsBefore and after vaccination (BNT162b2), blood samples were obtained from healthy, non-smoking individuals (relatively older male group, n=6 vs. younger female group, n=23), who did not have systemic diseases that required continuous treatment. Washed platelets were prepared and subjected to a fluorometric determination of platelet polyP levels using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The side effects of vaccination were recorded as scores. ResultsCompared with the male group, platelet polyP levels decreased in the relatively younger female group after the initial dose, while the side effect score increased in the female group after the second dose. Moderate correlation coefficients were observed between the reduction in polyP levels and the side effect scores or the original polyP levels. ConclusionsDespite being a pilot study using a small sample size, this study suggests the possibility that platelet polyP may suppress the side effects induced by the mRNA vaccines after the initial dose, but not the second dose, in relatively young female subjects who generally have high immune responsiveness. EssentialsO_LIThe COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2) reduced platelet polyP levels after the initial dose, but not after the 2nd dose, in relatively younger female subjects.

Subsequent studies have pointed out that patients with cancer are also at high risk for a critical disease course. Therefore, the most vulnerable patients are seemingly those with both cancer and CVD, and a careful, unified approach in the evaluation and management of this patient population is especially needed in times of the COVID-19 pandemic. This review provides an overview of the unique implications of the viral outbreak for the field of cardio-oncology and outlines key modifications in the approach to this ever-increasing patient population. These modifications include a shift toward greater utilization of cardiac biomarkers and a more focused CV imaging approach in the broader context of modifications to typical practice pathways.

Public policies designed to reduce transmission have made it extremely difficult to meet with service-users safely in the traditional face-to-face context. E-therapies have existed in theory and practice since technological progress has made them possible. They can offer a host of advantages over face-to-face equivalents, including improved access, greater flexibility for service-users and professionals, and cost savings. However, despite the emerging evidence and anticipated positive value, implementation has been slower than anticipated. Concerns have been raised by service-users, clinicians, and public health organisations, identifying significant barriers to the wide spread use of e-therapies. In the current climate, many clinicians are offering e-therapies for the first time, without prior arrangement or training, as the only viable option to continue to support their clients. This paper offers a clinically relevant review of the e-therapies literature, including effectiveness and acceptability dilemmas and challenges that need to be addressed to support the safe use and growth of e-therapies in psychology services.

COVID-19 is a highly contagious and potentially fatal respiratory infection which has spread within three months of its outbreak to more than 173 countries, causing 3.7 million infections and 256,551 deaths at this writing. Unfortunately, no treatment or vaccine currently exists for COVID-19, although several clinical trials are on-going to find a definite solution to this pandemic. Prevention through public health measures remain the best strategy recommended till date. This prevention involves physical distancing and compulsory confinement at home in several European countries, in the UK and USA. Unfortunately, home confinement decreed in most high-income countries like France has been dangerous for women, victims of psychological, physical and sexual violence from their intimate partner. Violence between intimate partners has become an unintended consequence of the stay-at-home policy against COVID-19. Since the promulgation of a home confinement decreed in many high resource settings (USA, UK, Europe, Canada, Australia, etc), the rate of violence between intimate partners has increased tremendously resulting to the worst scenario, women’s death in some of these countries. The stay-at-home law is not yet a national decree in several low resource settings like Africa, where COVID-19 has not been declared an epidemic in several countries. However, intimate partner violence has been reportedly described as a real violation of women’s right before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in the African continent. This commentary highlights the effects of intimate partner violence due to COVID-19 confinement in France and extrapolates what may be the effect of an implementation of a COVID-19 confinement law in Cameroon.

Furthermore, online searches were conducted to identify guidelines or support documents provided by NGOs, local health authorities, and societies and organizations in the field of diabetes and obstetrics. RESULTS: We included five national guidelines that were published in English from Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Australia health agencies. FBG, A1C, RPG were recommended as alternative tests instead of a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGGT) for GDM screening at 24-28 weeks of gestation. Recommendations also included a deferral of postpartum screening till the end of the pandemic, or postponement of testing to 6-12 months after delivery, use telemedicine and telecare. CONCLUSIONS: Updated temporary changes in clinical guidelines are sensible and accommodates social distancing and minimizes risk of exposure to COVID-19. Despite many unsolved controversies in screening, treatment, and follow-up of gestational diabetes, it seems involvement with novel coronavirus have made a reach to a global agreement simpler.","Nouhjah, Sedigheh; Jahanfar, Shayesteh; Shahbazian, Hajieh",Diabetes Metab Syndr,131,20

The cross-section of diseases to which these cells are applied is very wide, ranging from degenerative diseases, through autoimmune processes and to acute inflammatory diseases, e.g., viral infections. Indeed, now that first clinical trials applying MSCs against COVID-19 have started, important questions concern not only the therapeutic properties of MSCs, but also the changes that might occur in the cell features as a response to the ""cytokine storm"" present in the acute phase of an infection and capable of posing a risk to a patient. The aim of our study was thus to assess changes potentially occurring in the biology of MSCs in the active inflammatory environment, e.g., in regards to the cell cycle, cell migration and secretory capacity. The study using MSCs derived from Wharton's jelly (WJ-MSCs) was conducted under two aerobic conditions: 21% O(2) vs. 5% O(2), since oxygen concentration is one of the key factors in inflammation. Under both oxygen conditions cells were exposed to proinflammatory cytokines involved significantly in acute inflammation, i.e., IFNγ, TNFα and IL-1β at different concentrations. Regardless of the aerobic conditions, WJ-MSCs in the inflammatory environment do not lose features typical for mesenchymal cells, and their proliferation dynamic remains unchanged. Sudden fluctuations in proliferation, the early indicator of potential genetic disturbance, were not observed, while the cells' migration activity increased. The presence of pro-inflammatory factors was also found to increase the secretion of such anti-inflammatory cytokines as IL-4 and IL-10. It is concluded that the inflammatory milieu in vitro does not cause phenotype changes or give rise to proliferation disruption of WJ-MSCs, and nor does it inhibit the secretory properties providing for their use against acute inflammation.","Wedzinska, A.; Figiel-Dabrowska, A.; Kozlowska, H.; Sarnowska, A.",J Clin Med,131,1

Tocilizumab was applied and intended to target both COVID-19 and RA. However, disease of this patient aggravated after usage of tocilizumab. After the discussion of a multiple disciplinary team (MDT) including rheumatologists, antimicrobial treatments were applied to target the potential opportunistic infections (Pneumocystis jirovecii and Aspergillus fumigatus), which were authenticated several days later via high throughput sequencing. As an important cytokine in immune responses, IL-6 can be a double-edged sword: interference in the IL-6-IL-6 receptor signaling may save patients from cytokine release storm (CRS), but can also weaken the anti-infectious immunity, particularly in rheumatic patients, who may have received a long-term treatment with immunosuppressive/modulatory agents. Thus, we suggest careful considerations before and close monitoring in the administration of tocilizumab in rheumatic patients with COVID-19. Besides tocilizumab, several disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can also be applied in the treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, we also reviewed and discussed the application of these DMARDs in COVID-19 condition.","Cai, Shaozhe; Sun, Wei; Li, Ming; Dong, Lingli",Clin. rheumatol,131,24

METHODS: Between February 20, 2020 and April 4, 2020, consecutive confirmed 2541 COVID-19 patients from three designated hospitals were enrolled in this study. All patients received chest computed tomography (CT) and serological examinations at admission. Laboratory tests included routine blood tests, liver function, renal function, coagulation profile, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and arterial blood gas. The SaO2 was measured using pulse oxygen saturation in room air at resting status. Independent high-risk factors associated with death were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard model. A prognostic nomogram was constructed to predict the survival of severe COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: There were 124 severe patients in the training cohort, and there were 71 and 76 severe patients in the two independent validation cohorts, respectively. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that age &#8805; 70 years (HR = 1.184, 95% CI 1.061-1.321), panting (breathing rate &#8805; 30/min) (HR = 3.300, 95% CI 2.509-6.286), lymphocyte count < 1.0 × 109/L (HR = 2.283, 95% CI 1.779-3.267), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) > 10 pg/ml (HR = 3.029, 95% CI 1.567-7.116) were independent high-risk factors associated with fatal outcome. We developed the nomogram for identifying survival of severe COVID-19 patients in the training cohort (AUC = 0.900, 95% CI 0.841-0.960, sensitivity 95.5%, specificity 77.5%); in validation cohort 1 (AUC = 0.811, 95% CI 0.763-0.961, sensitivity 77.3%, specificity 73.5%); in validation cohort 2 (AUC = 0.862, 95% CI 0.698-0.924, sensitivity 92.9%, specificity 64.5%). The calibration curve for probability of death indicated a good consistence between prediction by the nomogram and the actual observation. The prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients with high levels of IL-6 receiving tocilizumab were better than that of those patients without tocilizumab both in the training and validation cohorts, but without difference (P = 0.105 for training cohort, P = 0.133 for validation cohort 1, and P = 0.210 for validation cohort 2). CONCLUSIONS: This nomogram could help clinicians to identify severe patients who have high risk of death, and to develop more appropriate treatment strategies to reduce the mortality of severe patients.

The pandemic has caused great harm to society and also caused serious psychological trauma to many people. Pediatrics are a vulnerable group in this global public health emergency, as their nervous systems, endocrine systems and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes are not well developed. Psychological crises often cause pediatrics to produce feelings of abandonment, despair, incapacity and exhaustion, and even raising the risk of suicide. Children with mental illnesses are especially vulnerable during the quarantine and social distancing period. The inclusion of psychosocial support for pediatrics and their families are part of the health responses to disaster and disaster recovery. Based on the bio-psycho-social model, some pediatrics may have catastrophic thoughts and are prone to experience despair, numbness, flashback and other serious emotional and behavioral reactions. In severe cases, there may be symptoms of psychosis or post-traumatic stress disorder. Timely and appropriate protections are needed to prevent the occurrence of psychological and behavioral problems. The emerging digital applications and health services such as telehealth, social media, mobile health and remote interactive online education are able to bridge the social distance and support mental and behavioral health for pediatric populations. Based on the psychological development characteristics of pediatrics, this study also illustrates interventions on the psychological impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though the world has been struggling to curb the influences of the pandemic, the quarantine and social distancing policies will have long-term impacts on pediatrics. Innovative digital solutions and informatics tools are needed more than ever to mitigate the negative consequences on pediatrics. Healthcare delivery and services should envision and implement innovative paradigms to meet broad well-being needs and pediatric health as the quarantine and social distancing over a longer term become a new reality. Future research on pediatric mental and behavioral health should pay more attention to novel solutions that incorporate cutting edge interactive technologies and digital approaches, leveraging considerable advances in pervasive and ubiquitous computing, human-computer interaction, health informatics and among many others. Digital approaches, health technologies and informatics are supposed to be designed and implemented to support public health surveillance and critical responses to pediatrics' growth and development. For instance, human-computer interactions, augmented reality and virtual reality could be incorporated to remote psychological supporting service for pediatric health; mobile technologies could be used to monitor pediatrics' mental and behavioral health while protecting their individual privacy; big data and artificial intelligences could be utilized to support decision-making on whether pediatrics should go out for physical activities and whether schools should be reopened, etc. Implications to clinical practice, psychological therapeutic practices and future research directions to address current efforts gaps have been highlighted.","Ye, Jiancheng",,131,16

The enzymatic activity and crystal structure of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) nsp15 are undefined, and the protein's role in replication remains unclear. We verified the uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (EndoU) activity of IBV and found that the EndoU active sites were located in the C-terminus of nsp15 and included His223, His238, Lys278 and Tyr334. We further constructed an infectious clone of the IBV-rSD strain (rSD-wild-type [WT]) and EndoU-deficient IBVs by changing the codon for the EndoU catalytic residues to alanine. Both the rSD-WT and EndoU-deficient viruses propagated efficiently in embryonated chicken eggs. Conversely, EndoU-deficient viral propagation was severely impaired in chicken embryonic kidney cells, which was reflected in the lower viral mRNA accumulation and protein synthesis. After infecting chickens with the parental rSD-WT strain and EndoU-deficient viruses, the EndoU-deficient-virus-infected chickens presented reduced mortality, tissue injury and viral shedding.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses can emerge from animal reservoirs into naive host species to cause pandemic respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases with significant mortality in humans and domestic animals. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a Î³-coronavirus, infects respiratory, renal and reproductive systems, causing millions of dollars in lost revenue worldwide annually. Mutating the viral endoribonuclease resulted in an attenuated virus and prevented protein kinase R activation. Therefore, EndoU activity is a virulence factor in IBV infections, thus providing an approach for generating live-attenuated vaccine candidates for emerging coronaviruses.","Zhao, Jing; Sun, Lu; Zhao, Ye; Feng, Delan; Cheng, Jinlong; Zhang, Guozhong",J. virol,131,0

This review aimed at examining the pooled prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak.MethodsSystematic searches of databases were conducted for literature published on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, PsycArticle, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure until October 14, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed using R software (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020180309).ResultsA total of 106,713 people exposed to the trauma resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak were identified in the 76 articles, of which 33,810 were reported with post-traumatic stress symptoms. The pooled prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak was 28.34%, with a 95% confidence interval of 23.03-34.32%. Subgroup analysis indicated that older age, male and bigger sample size were associated with higher prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms. After controlling for other factors, the results of meta-regression showed that the influence of gender and sample size on prevalence is no longer significant.ConclusionsSymptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were very common among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak.

METHODS: From December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021, we used data from the ""v-safe after vaccination health checker"" surveillance system, the v-safe pregnancy registry, and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to characterize the initial safety of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant persons. RESULTS: A total of 35,691 v-safe participants 16 to 54 years of age identified as pregnant. Injection-site pain was reported more frequently among pregnant persons than among nonpregnant women, whereas headache, myalgia, chills, and fever were reported less frequently. Among 3958 participants enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry, 827 had a completed pregnancy, of which 115 (13.9%) resulted in a pregnancy loss and 712 (86.1%) resulted in a live birth (mostly among participants with vaccination in the third trimester). Adverse neonatal outcomes included preterm birth (in 9.4%) and small size for gestational age (in 3.2%); no neonatal deaths were reported. Although not directly comparable, calculated proportions of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in persons vaccinated against Covid-19 who had a completed pregnancy were similar to incidences reported in studies involving pregnant women that were conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic. Among 221 pregnancy-related adverse events reported to the VAERS, the most frequently reported event was spontaneous abortion (46 cases).

In this work, we used a coarse-grained model to calculate the binding free energy of SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV to their human receptor ACE2. The investigation of the free energy contribution of the interacting residues indicates that the residues located outside the receptor binding domain are the source of the stronger binding of the novel virus. Thus, the current results suggest that the essential evolution of SARS-CoV-2 happens remotely from the binding domain at the spike protein trimeric body. Such evolution may facilitate the conformational change and the infection process that occurs after the virus is bound to ACE2. By studying the binding pattern between SARS-CoV antibody m396 and SARS-CoV-2, it is found that the remote energetic contribution is missing, which might explain the absence of cross-reactivity of such antibodies.","Bai, Chen; Warshel, Arieh",J Phys Chem B,131,0

Although studies in the past decade have demonstrated the utility of this approach for respiratory infections, it has not been widely adopted in routine clinical practice. The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has focused attention on the need for safe, convenient, timely, and scalable methods for collecting upper respiratory specimens for testing. The goals of this article are to highlight the literature regarding self-collected nasal or oropharyngeal specimens for respiratory pathogen testing; discuss the role of self-collection in helping prevent the spread of the COVID-19 disease from infected patients and facilitating a shift toward ""virtual"" medicine or telemedicine; and describe the current and future state of self-collection for infectious agents, and the impacts these approaches can have on population health management and disease diagnosis and prevention.","Cockerill, Franklin R; Wohlgemuth, Jay G; Radcliff, Jeff; Sabol, Christine E; Kapoor, Hema; Dlott, Jeffrey S; Marlowe, Elizabeth M; Clarke, Nigel J",Popul Health Manag,131,16

While the progress in this area is tremendously impressive, few wearable sensors with the capability of real-time blood pressure monitoring are approved for clinical use. One of the key obstacles in the further development of wearable sensors for medical applications is the lack of comprehensive technical evaluation of sensor materials against the expected clinical performance. Here, we present an extensive review and critical analysis of various materials applied in the design and fabrication of wearable sensors. In our unique transdisciplinary approach, we studied the fundamentals of blood pressure and examined its measuring modalities while focusing on their clinical use and sensing principles to identify material functionalities. Then, we carefully reviewed various categories of functional materials utilized in sensor building blocks allowing for comparative analysis of the performance of a wide range of materials throughout the sensor operational-life cycle. Not only this provides essential data to enhance the materials' properties and optimize their performance, but also, it highlights new perspectives and provides suggestions to develop the next generation pressure sensors for clinical use.","Al-Qatatsheh, Ahmed; Morsi, Yosry; Zavabeti, Ali; Zolfagharian, Ali; Salim, Nisa; Z Kouzani, Abbas; Mosadegh, Bobak; Gharaie, Saleh",,131,30

In our recent study, we explored the feasibility of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for clinical SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection compared with qRT-PCR using the same primer/probe sets issued by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) targeting viral ORF1ab or N gene, which showed that ddPCR could largely minimize the false negatives reports resulted by qRT-PCR [Suo T, Liu X, Feng J, et al. ddPCR: a more sensitive and accurate tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection in low viral load specimens. medRxiv [Internet]. 2020;2020.02.29.20029439.

Here, we further stringently compared the performance of qRT-PCR and ddPCR for 8 primer/probe sets with the same clinical samples and conditions. Results showed that none of 8 primer/probe sets used in qRT-PCR could significantly distinguish true negatives and positives with low viral load (10-4 dilution). Moreover, false positive reports of qRT-PCR with UCDC-N1, N2 and CCDC-N primers/probes sets were observed. In contrast, ddPCR showed significantly better performance in general for low viral load samples compared to qRT-PCR.

In this study, human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) 2'-fucosyllactose (&#945;-L-Fuc-(1,2)-D-Galß-1,4-Glu, 2'FL) and its isomer 3'-fucosyllactose (&#945;-L-Fuc-(1,3)-D-Galß-1,4-Glu, 3'FL) with potential prebiotic effect were synthesized efficiently by a novel recombinant &#945;-L-fucosidase. An &#945;-L-fucosidase gene (PbFuc) from Pedobacter sp. CAU209 was successfully cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The deduced amino acid sequence shared the highest identity of 36.8% with the amino sequences of other reported &#945;-L-fucosidases. The purified &#945;-L-fucosidase (PbFuc) had a molecular mass of 50 kDa. The enzyme exhibited specific activity (26.3 U/mg) towards 4-nitrophenyl-&#945;-L-fucopyranoside (pNP-FUC), 3'FL (8.9 U/mg), and 2'FL (3.4 U/mg). It showed the highest activity at pH 5.0 and 35 °C, respectively. PbFuc catalyzed the synthesis of 3'FL and 2'FL through a transglycosylation reaction using pNP-FUC as donor and lactose as acceptor, and total conversion ratio was up to 85% at the optimized reaction conditions. The synthesized mixture of 2'FL and 3'FL promoted the growth of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus NRRL B-548, L. casei subsp. casei NRRL B-1922, L. casei subsp. casei AS 1.2435, and Bifidobacterium longum NRRL B-41409.

Upon sensing of viral RNA, the E3 ubiquitin ligase TNF Receptor-Associated Factor-3 (TRAF3) is recruited along with its substrate TANK-Binding Kinase (TBK1), to MAVS-containing subcellular compartments, including mitochondria, peroxisomes, and the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (MAM). However, the regulation of such events remains largely unresolved. Here, we identify TRK-Fused Gene (TFG), a protein involved in the transport of newly synthesized proteins to the endomembrane system via the Coat Protein complex II (COPII) transport vesicles, as a new TRAF3-interacting protein allowing the efficient recruitment of TRAF3 to MAVS and TBK1 following Sendai virus (SeV) infection. Using siRNA and shRNA approaches, we show that TFG is required for virus-induced TBK1 activation resulting in C-terminal IRF3 phosphorylation and dimerization. We further show that the ability of the TRAF3-TFG complex to engage mTOR following SeV infection allows TBK1 to phosphorylate mTOR on serine 2159, a post-translational modification shown to promote mTORC1 signaling. We demonstrate that the activation of mTORC1 signaling during SeV infection plays a positive role in the expression of Viperin, IRF7 and IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) proteins, and that depleting TFG resulted in a compromised antiviral state. Our study, therefore, identifies TFG as an essential component of the RLR-dependent type I IFN antiviral response.","Khan, Kashif Aziz; Marineau, Alexandre; Doyon, Priscilla; Acevedo, Mariana; Durette, Étienne; Gingras, Anne-Claude; Servant, Marc J",PLoS Pathog,131,9

Objective: To investigate the association of SDT of radical prostatectomy and final pathological and survival outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from the US National Cancer Database (NCDB) and identified all patients with clinically localized (cT1-2cN0cM0) high-risk prostate adenocarcinoma diagnosed between 2006 and 2016 who underwent radical prostatectomy. Data analyses were performed from April 1 to April 12, 2020. Exposures: SDT was defined as the number of days between the initial cancer diagnosis and radical prostatectomy. SDT was categorized into 5 groups: 31 to 60, 61 to 90, 91 to 120, 121 to 150, and 151 to 180 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were predetermined as adverse pathological outcomes after radical prostatectomy, including pT3-T4 disease, pN-positive disease, and positive surgical margin. The adverse pathological score (APS) was defined as an accumulated score of the 3 outcomes (0-3). An APS of 2 or higher was considered a separate outcome to capture cases with more aggressive pathological features. The secondary outcome was overall survival. Results: Of the 32â¯184 patients included in the study, the median (interquartile range) age was 64 (59-68) years, and 25â¯548 (79.4%) were non-Hispanic White. Compared with an SDT of 31 to 60 days, longer SDTs were not associated with higher risks of having any adverse pathological outcomes (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% CI, 0.80-1.12; P = .53), pT3-T4 disease (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.83-1.17; P = .87), pN-positive disease (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.59-1.06; P = .12), positive surgical margin (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.74-1.05; P = .17), or APS greater than or equal to 2 (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.74-1.05; P = .17). Longer SDT was also not associated with worse overall survival (for SDT of 151-180 days, hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.79-1.59, P = .53). Subgroup analyses performed for patients with very high-risk disease (primary Gleason score 5) and sensitivity analyses with SDT considered as a continuous variable yielded similar results. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of patients who underwent radical prostatectomy within 180 days of diagnosis for high-risk prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy for high-risk prostate cancer could be safely delayed up to 6 months after diagnosis.","Xia, Leilei; Talwar, Ruchika; Chelluri, Raju R; Guzzo, Thomas J; Lee, Daniel J",JAMA Netw Open,131,9

We aimed at implementing a novel multidimensional HCP-centric evidence-based, dynamic policy with the objectives to reduce risk of HCP infection, ensure welfare and safety of the HCP and to improve willingness to accept and return to duty. SETTING: Our tertiary care university hospital, with 12 600 HCP, was divided into high-risk, medium-risk and low-risk zones. In the high-risk and medium-risk zones, we organised training, logistic support, postduty HCP welfare and collected feedback, and sent them home after they tested negative for COVID-19. We supervised use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and kept communication paperless. PARTICIPANTS: We recruited willing low-risk HCP, aged <50 years, with no comorbidities to work in COVID-19 zones. Social distancing, hand hygiene and universal masking were advocated in the low-risk zone. RESULTS: Between 31 March and 20 July 2020, we clinically screened 5553 outpatients, of whom 3012 (54.2%) were COVID-19 suspects managed in the medium-risk zone. Among them, 346 (11.4%) tested COVID-19 positive (57.2% male) and were managed in the high-risk zone with 19 (5.4%) deaths. One (0.08%) of the 1224 HCP in high-risk zone, 6 (0.62%) of 960 HCP in medium-risk zone and 23 (0.18%) of the 12 600 HCP in the low-risk zone tested positive at the end of shift. All the 30 COVID-19-positive HCP have since recovered. This HCP-centric policy resulted in low transmission rates (<1%), ensured satisfaction with training (92%), PPE (90.8%), medical and psychosocial support (79%) and improved acceptance of COVID-19 duty with 54.7% volunteering for re-deployment. CONCLUSION: A multidimensional HCP-centric policy was effective in ensuring safety, satisfaction and welfare of HCP in a resource-poor setting and resulted in a willing workforce to fight the pandemic.","Dutta, Usha; Sachan, Anurag; Premkumar, Madhumita; Gupta, Tulika; Sahoo, Swapnajeet; Grover, Sandeep; Sharma, Sugandhi; Lakshmi, P V M; Talati, Shweta; Biswal, Manisha; Suri, Vikas; Singh, Mini P; Ghai, Babita; Chhabra, Rajesh; Bharti, Bhavneet; Samanta, Jayanta; Arora, Pankaj; Mohindra, Ritin; Malhotra, Sunita; Singh, Gurmeet; Guru, Rashmi Ranjan; Pandey, Navin; Koushal, Vipin; Kumar, Ashok; Bhogal, Ranjitpal Singh; Aggarwal, Arun K; Goel, Kapil; Malhotra, Pankaj; Yaddanapudi, Narayana; Mahajan, Pranay; Thakur, J S; Sehgal, Rakesh; Ghosh, Arnab; Sehgal, Inderpaul Singh; Agarwal, Ritesh; Jayashree, Muralidharan; Bhalla, Ashish; Jain, Sanjay; Kochhar, Rakesh; Chakrabarti, Arunaloke; Puri, Goverdhan Dutt; Ram, Jagat",BMJ Open,131,22

To date, only a few studies have drawn attention to the psychological impact of lockdown on Italian children's mental health. The present study aimed to investigate the psychological distress (anxiety and mood symptoms) and perceived changes in routine among Italian primary and middle school students during the COVID-19 quarantine. METHODS: This interview study was performed between the 18th of May and 7th of June 2020: it involved a sample of 82 children and adolescents living in Milan (Italy), attending primary and middle school (aged 6 to 14 years), and their parents. RESULTS: Almost 30 % of the subjects reported having struggled to adjust to home learning. 36 responders completely changed their dietary habits during the lockdown: they were not eating the same amount of food and were consuming more junk food. Sleep habits were also affected by the lockdown measures: 28 % of the sample had difficulties sleeping and wished to sleep in their parents' bed. Concerning psychological distress, 64 (78 %) children and adolescents had anxiety symptoms; 43.9 % of the students reported significant mood symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Children are not indifferent to the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 epidemic: our data confirm their difficulties in adapting to the quarantine measures. The effects of stress exposure may not manifest later on during the children's development, and, for this reason, it would be interesting to follow up on these participants to improve our understanding of how long these outcomes may last.","Segre, G; Campi, R; Scarpellini, F; Clavenna, A; Zanetti, M; Cartabia, M; Bonati, M",BMC Pediatr,131,9

In 2019, a Phase IV Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI)-linked malaria vaccine implementation was underway. However, in December 2019, a novel pneumonia condition termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with many clinical, epidemiological, and biological parallels to malaria, was reported in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 is spreading rapidly, and, as of the 3rd of June, 2020, more than 382,507 persons had died from COVID-19. Children under 5 years who suffer high malaria-attributable mortalities are largely asymptomatic for COVID-19. Considering that the malaria burden is highest in low-income tropical countries with little capacity to fund malaria control and eradication programs, the fight against malaria in these regions is likely to be hampered. Access to healthcare has generally been limited, while malaria interventions, such as seasonal malaria chemotherapy and distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets, have been suspended due to lockdowns. Likewise, the repurposing of antimalarials for treatment of COVID-19 shared symptoms and the shift in focus from the production of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to COVID-19 RDTs is a cause for concern in malaria-endemic regions. Children are less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the elderly. However, due to the fears of contracting SARS-CoV-2, the elderly who are worst affected by COVID-19 may not take children for malaria medication, resulting in high malaria-related mortalities among children. COVID-19 has disproportionately affected developed countries, threatening their donation capacity. These are likely to thwart malaria control efforts in low-income regions. Here, we present perspectives on the collateral impact of COVID-19 on malaria, especially in Africa.","Nghochuzie, Nora Nganyewo; Olwal, Charles Ochieng039; Udoakang, Aniefiok John; Amenga-Etego, Lucas Naam-Kayagre; Amambua-Ngwa, Alfred",Front.

Post-transplant patients are especially high risk and underrepresented in the literature. In these patients, cytokine release may play a significant role in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome, raising the hypothesis that interleukin-6 inhibitors such as tocilizumab may be of benefit. Here, we describe two high-risk post-transplant patients who were treated with single-dose tocilizumab after intubation for moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to confirmed COVID-19 infection. Both patients recovered rapidly and were successfully extubated and discharged from the hospital without need for supplemental oxygen shortly thereafter, and their clinical improvement correlated with response in interleukin-6 levels. Tocilizumab appears to hold promise for critically ill COVID-19 patients who require mechanical ventilation when given shortly after intubation.","Ladna, M; Villanueva, F L; Maharrey, P B; Lascano, J",Respir Med Case Rep,131,21

The study aims to understand what factors contribute to different COVID-19 impacts at the country level. METHODS: Multivariate statistical analyses were used to evaluate COVID-19 deaths and cases relative to nine other demographic and socioeconomic factors in all countries and regions of the world using data as of August 1, 2020. The factors analyzed in the study include a country's total COVID-19 deaths and cases per million population, per capita gross domestic product (GDP), population density, virus tests per million population, median age, government response stringency index, hospital beds availability per thousand population, extreme poverty rate, Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination rate, and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) immunization rate. RESULTS: The study reveals that COVID-19 deaths per million population in a country most significantly correlates, inversely, with the country's BCG vaccination rate (r = - 0.50, p = 5.3e-5), and also significantly correlates a country's per capita GDP (r = 0.39, p = 7.4e-3) and median age (r = 0.30, p = 0.042), while COVID-19 cases per million population significantly correlate with per capita GDP and tests per thousand population. To control for possible confounding effects of age, the correlation was assessed in countries propensity score matched for age. The inverse correlation between BCG vaccination rates and COVID-19 case (r = - 0.30, p = 0.02) and death (r = - 0.42, p = 0.0007) remained significant among the top 61 countries with the highest median age. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to a growing body of evidence supporting the notion that BCG vaccination may be protective against COVID-19 mortality.","Li, Willis X",Infection,131,20

METHODS: Participants from 3 adult cohorts in the general population in France were invited to participate in a survey on COVID-19. The main outcome was COVID-19-Like Symptoms (CLS), defined as a sudden onset of cough, fever, dyspnea, ageusia and/or anosmia, that lasted more than 3 days and occurred during the 17 days before the survey. We used delayed-entry Cox models to identify associated factors. RESULTS: Between April 2, 2020 and May 12, 2020, 279,478 participants were invited, 116,903 validated the questionnaire and 106,848 were included in the analysis. Three thousand thirty-five cases of CLS were reported during 62,099 person-months of follow-up.

The risk of CLS was lower in older age groups and higher in French regions with a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in participants living in cities > 100,000 inhabitants (vs rural areas), when at least one child or adolescent was living in the same household, in overweight or obese people, and in people with chronic respiratory diseases, anxiety or depression or chronic diseases other than diabetes, cancer, hypertension or cardiovascular diseases. CONCLUSION: The incidence of CLS in the general population remained high during the first 2 weeks of lockdown, and decreased significantly thereafter.

The SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein is considered a main target for neutralizing antibodies. In order to better understand the kinetics of the antibody response, we evaluated the relation between two consecutive antibody titers determined over an average period of four months. A total of 628 subjects were included in the study. A significant reduction of the antibody titers over time was found: Ab Titer 1: 8.1 Arbitrary Units (AU)/mL (IQR: 4.8-29.3);Ab Titer 2: 6.2 AU/mL (IQR: 0-28.5);p&lt;0.0001.

Effective vaccines remain the most promising approach to counter SARS-CoV-2. Yet, while promising results are emerging from COVID-19 vaccine trials, the need for multiple doses and the challenges associated with the widespread distribution and administration of vaccines remain concerns. Here, we engineered the coat protein of the MS2 bacteriophage and generated nanoparticles displaying multiple copies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. The use of these nanoparticles as vaccines generated high neutralizing antibody titers and protected Syrian hamsters from a challenge with SARS-CoV-2 after a single immunization with no infectious virus detected in the lungs. This nanoparticle-based vaccine platform thus provides protection after a single immunization and may be broadly applicable for protecting against SARS-CoV-2 and future pathogens with pandemic potential.","Chiba, Shiho; Frey, Steven J; Halfmann, Peter J; Kuroda, Makoto; Maemura, Tadashi; Yang, Jie E; Wright, Elizabeth R; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Kane, Ravi S",Commun Biol,131,26

In early 2020, we saw an increase in panic buying as a response to a real and/or perceived lack of resources due to COVID-19. Although panic buying has a long history, there is a lack of literature to provide a psychological understanding of the phenomenon. During the early days of COVID-19 clients presented with fear and uncertainty. These negative emotions were, in part, a response to a real shortage of basic supplies. However, the panic response led to behaviors that, for some individuals, resulted in atypical buying patterns. From a therapeutic perspective, one can consider behavioral and psychodynamic explanations and interventions, and how this impacts the associated behaviors. This article will focus on psychodynamic understandings of panic buying as a response to events that result in negative emotions. By providing a psychodynamic understanding of panic buying, authors hope to contribute to the therapy of clients presenting with related behaviors and their associated negative affect.","Cooper, Marty A; Gordon, Jamie L",Front Public Health,131,16

However, this relationship has only been discussed in a relatively stable environmental situation and it is not clear whether such a relationship remains positive during environmental turbulence (ET) and whether organizations adopting EM activities during such turbulence, will change their behavior to enhance their performance. Thus, this study aims to examine the relationship between EM and the performance of Egyptian banks. Furthermore, building upon environmental contingency theory, this study examined the moderating role of ET on the relationship between EM and the performance of banks in Egypt. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected during the period March-June 2020 using a sample of 358 employees working in 20 banks in Egypt. Online surveys and self-administered questionnaires were used to collect the required data during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hypotheses were tested through structural equation modeling using SPSS 25. Findings The main results of this study indicated that EM and bank performance are positively related. Results also showed that ET and technological turbulence positively moderates this relationship, i.e. this relationship is more robust in highly turbulent business environments than in more stable environments. Practical implications This study provides useful managerial and practical implications. Fruitful insights can be communicated to bank managers in Egypt on the importance of EM and its implications for performance. With an increased understanding of EM, bank managers will come to understand that EM is critical for the sustainability and development of their banks. Originality/value An extensive review of the existing research material indicates that this is the first study to examine the relationship between EM and Egyptian banking performance and the moderating role of ET, particularly in large organizations.","Hilal, O.

METHODS: A total of 94 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. According to the severity of COVID-19, the patients were divided into three groups (moderate 49, severe 35, and critical 10), and 40 healthy cases were enrolled in the same period as healthy controls. The diagnostic and prognostic value of indices in peripheral blood cell count and general biochemical analysis was analyzed. RESULTS: Compared with healthy cases, the value differences in peripheral blood analysis in patients with COVID-19 were statistically significant (p < 0.01), the differences in LYM, neutrophil count (Neu), platelet count (PLT), and white blood cell count (WBC) were statistically significant among different severity of COVID-19 (p < 0.05). Compared with healthy cases, the differences in general biochemical results in patients with COVID-19 were statistically significant (p < 0.01), the value differences in direct bilirubin (DBIL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-Ch), and nitrogen (urea) were statistically significant among different severity of COVID-19 (p < 0.05).

However, the effect of the street network on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence has been insufficiently studied. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which causes COVID-19, is far more transmissible than previous respiratory viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which highlights the role of the spatial configuration of street network in COVID-19 spread, as it is where humans have contact with each other, especially in high-density areas. To fill this research gap, this study utilized space syntax theory and investigated the effect of the urban BE on the spatial diffusion of COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong. METHOD: This study collected a comprehensive dataset including a total of 3815 confirmed cases and corresponding locations from January 18 to October 5, 2020. Based on the space syntax theory, six space syntax measures were selected as quantitative indicators for the urban BE. A linear regression model and Geographically Weighted Regression model were then applied to explore the underlying relationships between COVID-19 cases and the urban BE. In addition, we have further improved the performance of GWR model considering the spatial heterogeneity and scale effects by adopting an adaptive bandwidth. RESULT: Our results indicated a strong correlation between the geographical distribution of COVID-19 cases and the urban BE. Areas with higher integration (a measure of the cognitive complexity required for a pedestrians to reach a street) and betweenness centrality values (a measure of spatial network accessibility) tend to have more confirmed cases. Further, the Geographically Weighted Regression model with adaptive bandwidth achieved the best performance in predicting the spread of COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: In this study, we revealed a strong positive relationship between the spatial configuration of street network and the spread of COVID-19 cases. The topology, network accessibility, and centrality of an urban area were proven to be effective for use in predicting the spread of COVID-19. The findings of this study also shed light on the underlying mechanism of the spread of COVID-19, which shows significant spatial variation and scale effects. This study contributed to current literature investigating the spread of COVID-19 cases in a local scale from the space syntax perspective, which may be beneficial for epidemic and pandemic prevention.","Yao, Y.; Shi, W.; Zhang, A.; Liu, Z.; Luo, S.",International Journal of Health Geographics [Electronic Resource],131,16

Here, we performed an analysis of the protease recognition sites and antigenic variation of the S-protein of these HCoVs. We showed tissue-specific expression pattern, functions, and a number of recognition sites of proteases in S-proteins from seven strains of HCoVs. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, we found two new protease recognition sites, each of calpain-2, pepsin-A, and caspase-8, and one new protease recognition site each of caspase-6, caspase-3, and furin. Our antigenic mapping study of the S-protein of these HCoVs showed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus strain has the most potent antigenic epitopes (highest antigenicity score with maximum numbers of epitope regions). Additionally, the other six strains of HCoVs show common antigenic epitopes (both B-cell and T-cell), with low antigenicity scores compared to SARS-CoV-2. We suggest that the molecular evolution of structural proteins of human CoV can be classified, such as (i) HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, (ii) SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV and (iii) HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1.

Many individuals who become infected may have pre-existing conditions that may interact with COVID-19 to increase symptom severity and mortality risk. COVID-19 patient comorbidities are likely to be informative regarding the individual risk of severe illness and mortality. Determining the degree to which comorbidities are associated with severe symptoms and mortality would thus greatly assist in COVID-19 care planning and provision. To assess this we performed a meta-analysis of published global literature, and machine learning predictive analysis using an aggregated COVID-19 global dataset. Our meta-analysis suggested that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cerebrovascular disease (CEVD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, malignancy, and hypertension as most significantly associated with COVID-19 severity in the current published literature. Machine learning classification using novel aggregated cohort data similarly found COPD, CVD, CKD, type 2 diabetes, malignancy, and hypertension, as well as asthma, as the most significant features for classifying those deceased versus those who survived COVID-19. While age and gender were the most significant predictors of mortality, in terms of symptom–comorbidity combinations, it was observed that Pneumonia–Hypertension, Pneumonia–Diabetes, and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)–Hypertension showed the most significant associations with COVID-19 mortality.

Typically delivered piecemeal in the UK, by a variety of agencies with inconsistent funding, provision is fragmented and many such interventions struggle to continue after only a short start-up period. This realist review investigates what can promote or hinder such interventions in being able to sustain long term. METHODS: Key sources of evidence were gathered using formal searches of electronic databases and grey literature, together with informal search methods such as citation tracking. No restrictions were made on article type or study design; only data pertaining to regularly meeting, ongoing, community-based interventions were included. Data were extracted, assessed, organised and synthesised and a realist logic of analysis applied to trace context–mechanism–outcome configurations as part an overall programme theory. Consultation with stakeholders, involved with a variety of such interventions, informed this process throughout. RESULTS: Ability to continually get and keep members; staff and volunteers; the support of other services and organisations; and funding/income were found to be critical, with multiple mechanisms feeding into these suboutcomes, sensitive to context. These included an emphasis on socialising and person-centredness; lowering stigma and logistical barriers; providing support and recognition for personnel; networking, raising awareness and sharing with other organisations, while avoiding conflict; and skilled financial planning and management. CONCLUSIONS: This review presents a theoretical model of what is involved in the long-term sustainability of community-based interventions. Alongside the need for longer-term funding and skilled financial management, key factors include the need for stigma-free, person-centred provision, sensitive to members’ diversity and social needs, as well as the need for a robust support network including the local community, health and care services. Challenges were especially acute for small scale and rural groups.","Morton, Thomas; Wong, Geoff; Atkinson, Teresa; Brooker, Dawn",BMJ Open,131,26

COVID-pos patients more frequently had a history of diabetes (P = .016) and alcoholism (P = .023), a lower leukocyte count (P = .014) and a higher mortality rate — 29.2% versus 14.4% — (P = .014) when compared to COVID-neg patients. Patients on PPIs were 2.3 times less likely (odds ratio [OR] = 0.4381, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.2331, 0.8175], P = .0053) to develop COVID-19 infection, compared to those not on PPIs. No other treatment decreased or increased this risk. COVID-pos patients on antipsychotics (P = .0013) and OADs (P = .0153), particularly metformin (P = .0237), were less likely to die. Thus, patients on treatment with PPI were less likely to develop COVID-19 infection, and those on antipsychotics or metformin had a lower risk of mortality. However, prospective studies, including clinical trials, are needed to confirm or not these findings.

Clinical data is limited up to now regarding the risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe case with COVID-19. Aims: This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of COVID-19 in terms of the association of cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases. Methods: Retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the Central Hospital of Wuhan in Wuhan, China, from January 15 to January 24, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was March 3, 2020. A comparative study was applied between cases with CVMs and those without CVMs. Results: Of all, clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 80.5%, while 87.8% of all had history of patient contact. The population was presented with a mean age of 39.1 +- 9.2 and less comorbidities than community population. The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed were fever (82.9%), myalgia or fatigue (80.5%) and cough (63.4%). While, the three most frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue (80.5%), fever (73.2%) and cough (41.5%). There were 95.1% cases featured as non-severe course of disease according to the official standard in China. Patients with CVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5% and 41.5%, respectively. Compared with cases without CVMs, patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count (0.99 +- 0.43 and 1.55 +- 0.61, P<0.001), more who had at least once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission (50.0% and 11.8%, P=0.011), and more received oxygen support (79.2% and 23.5%, P<0.001). The rate of in-hospital adverse events was significantly higher in patients with CVMs group (75.0% and 23.5%, P=0.001). Multivariable logistic regression model indicated that, coexisting with CVMs in COVID-19 patients was not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events. Conclusions: Most of hospital staff with COVID-19 had history of patient contact, featured non-severe course of disease. Cases with CVMs suffered from more in-hospital adverse events than those without CVMs. But concomitant CVMs were not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events in COVID-19 patients.","Liu, Ru; Ming, Xiaoyan; Xu, Ou; Zhou, Jianli; Peng, Hui; Xiang, Ning; Zhang, Jiaming; Zhu, Hong",,131,22

Water sorption measurements were then carried out for soot compacted into pellet form and in powder form, using both a gravimetric microbalance and a manometric analyser. Water adsorption isotherms are all found to be Type V, and reveal the central role of the specific surface area and the oxygen content of soot. A single parametrization of the second Dubinin-Serpinsky model gives a proper fit for all isotherms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide physico-chemical parameters and water sorption results for fire soot. This enables a better description of the soot cake formed on filters during a fire, in particular in industrial confined facilities as simulated in this study. Humidity can be then explicitly considered in the same way as other parameters influencing the aeraulic resistance of soot cakes.

Agency decisions, including to allow antibody test marketing without emergency use authorization or review, and the back-and-forth guidance on laboratory-developed tests, have met harsh criticism and unreliable results. Though the long-term results of these decisions are unclear, the FDA's credibility, reliability, and commitment to safety are threatened by even further lessening medical device regulatory oversight during the coronavirus pandemic. The relaxed and fix-it-later approach to many of the FDA's public health emergency decisions regarding medical devices reflect the ongoing criticisms of medical device regulation in general, specifically the 510(k) process and laboratory developed test regulation, offering a point of reflection towards reform.

False-positive virus detection tests not only aggravate the situation in the healthcare sector, but also provide ground for speculations. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of software choice and data interpretation in virome studies. We aimed to further expand theoretical and practical knowledge in bioinformatics-driven virome studies by focusing on short, virus-like DNA sequences in metagenomic data. Analyses of datasets obtained from different sample types (terrestrial, animal and human related samples) and origins showed that coronavirus-like sequences have existed in host-associated and environmental samples before the current COVID-19 pandemic. In the analyzed datasets, various Betacoronavirus-like sequences were detected that also included SARS-CoV-2 matches. Deepening analyses indicated that the detected sequences are not of viral origin and thus should not be considered in virome profiling approaches. Our study confirms the importance of parameter selection, especially in terms of read length, for reliable virome profiling. Natural environments are an important source of coronavirus-like nucleotide sequences that should be taken into account when virome datasets are analyzed and interpreted. We therefore suggest that processing parameters are carefully selected for SARS-CoV-2 profiling in host related as well as environmental samples in order to avoid incorrect identifications.","Mora, Maximilian; Wicaksono, Wisnu Adi; Egamberdieva, Dilfuza; Krause, Robert; Martinez, Jose Luis; Cernava, Tomislav; Berg, Gabriele",Sci Total Environ,131,0

METHODS: A survey sent to all residents of the 201 ACGME-accredited Orthopaedic Surgery programs in the United States. RESULTS: A total of 309 Orthopaedic surgery residents responded to our survey. A subset of 283 (91.6%) residents surveyed reported decreased Orthopaedic-related clinical duty hours due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 300/309 (97.1%) reported a decrease in surgical case volume. 298 (96.4%) residents reported that their program had scheduled activities or made changes to supplement their education, most common being virtual and video conferences 296/309 (95.5%), required practice questions 132/309 (42.7%), required reading or pre-recorded lectures 122/309 (39.5%), in-person small group meetings or lectures 24/309 (7.77%), and surgical simulation activities 17/309 (5.50%).

In the present study we described the clinical course and risk factors for transfer to ICU and mortality of SARS-Cov-2 positive patients affected by acute respiratory failure, hospitalized in a Respiratory Intermediate Care Unit in the south of Italy. Methods In this retrospective, observational single centre study we evaluated 96 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients affected by acute respiratory failure (ARF). We compared demographic data, laboratory data and clinical outcomes between deceased and survived patients, aiming to identify risk factors for transfer to ICU and mortality, and possible gender-related differences. Results Of 96 patients, 51 (53.1%) survived and 45 (46.9 %) died. Among those who died, 23 (51.1%) deceased in RICU. Twenty-nine (30.2%) were transferred to ICU, of whom 22 (75.9%) died in ICU. Patients affected by COPD have a higher mortality compared to patients without this comorbidity (p=0.002). Lower baseline P/F ratio (p=0,014) and neurologic comorbidities (p=0,008) emerged as risk factors for death. Male were younger than female patients (66 vs 80 y.o.; p=0.042). In female patients, lower peripheral blood lymphocyte count (p=0.007) is a risk factor for death, characteristic gender-related in our sample. Female sex was a protective parameter against transfer to ICU (p=0,036) and P/F ratio was not a significant predictor of transfer to ICU (p=0,227). Only higher baseline CRP (p=0,034) has shown a predictive role for transfer to ICU in our sample. Patients deceased after a transfer to ICU had younger age (p=0,000), lower median comorbidity number (p=0,000), lower D-dimer (p=0,029) and lower prevalence of female sex (p=0,029). Discussion Mortality in our study was similar to that found in other studies involving patients in non-invasive ventilation. In our study older age and comorbidities play as predictors of death in COVID-19 patients. COPD, despite presenting low prevalence, is a risk factor for death, both in men and women. In female patients chronic ischemic heart disease and congestive heart failure are death predictors. High CRP and lymphopenia, linked to inflammatory status, are predictors of transfer to ICU. Patients transferred to ICU higher mortality than the others, and patients who die in ICU are mostly men, younger and have less comorbidities. Baseline P/F ratio is not a good predictor of transfer to ICU, while in our sample is a sensible predictor of death. More studies need to be performed on COVID-19 patients, in the urgency of COVID-19 pandemic persistence.","Buonamico, E.; Quaranta, V.

We assessed the relative filtering efficacy of two currently used surgical face masks (one a molded mask, the other a tie-on mask) and a certified personal particulate respirator, all made by a single manufacturer. METHODS: The authors sprayed bicarbonate particulate against a porcelain surface (representing the patient's mouth) and collected it via a mannequin head (representing the dentist's head) placed 40 centimeters away and a tube with two airflow rates (0.5 cubic meters per hour and 9 m(3)/hour). They calculated the dry residue weight. They performed three separate runs for each mask and three runs with no mask at the two airflow rates with and without aerosol. RESULTS: With no mask (control), the authors recorded significant weight gains at both airflow rates with and without vaporization. With vaporization, the three masks were associated with different dry residue weights (P < .03 with the Kruskal-Wallis test at both flow rates), the respirator providing the lowest amount. The respirator provided an efficiency of 94 to 96 percent, compared with 90 to 92 percent and 85 to 86 percent for the molded and tie-on surgical masks, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide independent evidence that a certified personal respirator can be more effective than high-quality surgical masks in dental settings.

The unique challenge for clinicians has been to define which arthroplasty patients most urgently require surgery. The present study aimed to investigate priority arthroplasty procedures during the pandemic and in the reinstatement period from the surgeon’s perspective. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online survey was conducted among members of the European Hip Society (EHS), European Knee Associates (EKA) and other invited orthopaedic arthroplasty surgeons (experts) from across the world. The survey consisted of 17 different arthroplasty procedures/indications of which participants were asked to choose and rank the most important 10. RESULTS: Four hundred and thirty-nine arthroplasty surgeons from 44 countries responded. The EHS and EKA had a 43% response rate of members. In weighted average points, the majority of respondents (67.5 points) ranked ‘acute fractures requiring arthroplasty (Periprosthetic fractures, THA/hemi-arthroplasty for femoral neck fractures)’ as priority indication number one, followed by ‘first-stage explantations for acute PJI (periprosthetic joint infection)’ in second place and priority indication (45.9 points) three as ‘one-stage revision for acute PJI’ (39.7 points). CONCLUSIONS: There was agreement that femoral neck fractures, periprosthetic fractures, and acute infections should be prioritised and cannot be postponed in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. As arthroplasty procedures are being resumed in most countries now, there has also been a relaxation of lockdown rules in most countries, which might cause a so-called second wave of the pandemic. Therefore, the results of the current study present a proposal by experts as to which operations should be prioritised in the setting of a second wave of the pandemic.","Thaler, Martin; Kort, Nanne; Zagra, Luigi; Hirschmann, Michael T.; Khosravi, Ismail; Liebensteiner, Michael; Karachalios, Theofilos; Tandogan, Reha N.",Knee Surg Sports Traumatol Arthrosc,131,1

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among HCWs and factors correlated with mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. And, it also aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Bangla version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between July and August, 2020. A self-reported online questionnaire was utilized to collect data. The survey included questions concerning socio-demographic, lifestyle, and work setting, as well as the HADS. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multiple linear regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: Data from 803 HCWs (50.7% male; mean age: 27.3 [SD = 6.9]; age range: 18-58 years) were included in the final analysis. The Bangla HADS was psychometrically sound, and demonstrated good internal consistency and reliability (α = 0.83), and excellent construct validity. Prevalence estimates of anxiety and depression were 69.5%, and 39.5%, respectively, for less severe symptomology (at least borderline abnormal), and 41.2% and 15.7% for more severe (at least abnormal) symptomology. Regression analyses with the total HADS score as a dependent variable revealed significant (p < 0.05) associations with female gender, moderate and poor health status, infrequent physical exercising, smoking, having had regrets about one’s profession because of the pandemic and associated experiences, not updating on the latest COVID-19-related research, experiencing discrimination in the workplace, and facing social problems due to working in a lab or hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of anxiety and depression are prevalent among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The findings suggest a need for screening for mental health concerns, and employing early intervention to help these individuals.","Tasnim, Rafia; Sujan, Md. Safaet Hossain; Islam, Md.

Alphaviral nonstructural protein 1 (nsP1) orchestrates the capping of nascent viral RNA via its S‐adenosyl methionine‐dependent N‐7‐methyltransferase (MTase) and guanylyltransferase activities. Here, we developed and validated a novel capillary electrophoresis (CE)‐based assay for measuring the MTase activity of purified VEEV and CHIKV nsP1. We employed the assay to assess the MTase inhibition efficiency of a few adenosine analogs and identified 5‐iodotubercidin (5‐IT) as an inhibitor of nsP1. The antiviral potency of 5‐IT was evaluated in vitro using a combination of cell‐based assays, which suggest that 5‐IT is efficacious against CHIKV in cell culture (EC(50): 0.409 µm).","Mudgal, Rajat; Mahajan, Supreeti; Tomar, Shailly",FEBS Lett,131,1

Implicit Association Tests (IATs) offer a validated means of evaluating unconscious associations and preferences. This study examines the perceived role of implicit bias in faculty development in academic emergency medicine (EM). Methods EM faculty at a large urban academic medical center were invited to independently participate in a self-reflection assessment in preparation for a faculty retreat session discussing diversity, equity, and inclusion. Participants completed two IATs designed to examine gender associations (gender IAT) and race preferences (race IAT) followed by a short anonymous survey where IAT scores were recorded. The survey also captured demographic information and perceptions about the impact of gender and racial biases in faculty development. Results Forty faculty members (66%) completed the survey; 70% were male and 80% white. The majority (59%) reported gender IAT results indicating automatic male-sciences and female-liberal arts associations. Nearly half (45%) reported race IAT results indicating an automatic preference for white people. More than 70% of males reported that faculty recruitment, development, and promotion decisions were ‘never’ or ‘seldom’ affected by gender bias, while more than 80% reported racial bias ‘never’ or ‘seldom’ affects these decisions. Female faculty more frequently perceived adverse effects of unconscious gender and race biases. Conclusion Our group of academic physicians reported IAT results showing different levels of implicit bias compared to the general population. Female faculty may be both more aware of and more susceptible to the adverse effects of unconscious biases. Further study is needed to determine both the extent to which unconscious biases affect the academic workplace, as well as ways in which such unintentional forms of discrimination can be eliminated. Unconscious biases are not unique to EM. Intentional efforts to increase self-awareness of these 'blind spots' may help mitigate their impact and foster a more diverse and inclusive healthcare environment.","Cleveland Manchanda, Emily C; Macias-Konstantopoulos, Wendy L",Cureus,131,21

United Kingdom surveys found general support for the development of such an app, which seemed strongly influenced by public trust. Institutions developing the app were called upon to fulfil the commitment to public trust by acting with trustworthiness. Such calls presuppose that public trust associated with the app can emerge if the conditions for trustworthiness are met and that public trust is simplistic, i.e., linearly the sum of each member of the publics’ individual – U.K. government trust relationship. Drawing on a synthesis of the trust literature and fifteen interviews with members of the public trialling the app on the Isle of Wight, this paper aims to explore what trust mechanisms and relationships are at play when thinking about public trust in the context of the U.K. COVID-19 app. We argue that public trust is a complex social phenomenon and not linearly correlated with institutional trustworthiness. As such, attention needs to widen from calls for trustworthy infrastructures as a way to build public trust, to a deeper understanding of those doing the trusting; in particular, what or whom do people place their trust in (or not) when considering whether using the app and why. An understanding of this will help when trying to secure public trust during the implementation of necessary public health measures.

The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has breached the borders of Europe. Public health surveillance is necessary to inform policy and guide leaders. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide advanced surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission that account for weekly shifts in the pandemic, speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence, to better understand countries at risk for explosive growth and those that are managing the pandemic effectively. METHODS: We performed a longitudinal trend analysis and extracted 62 days of COVID-19 data from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in Europe as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: New COVID-19 cases slightly decreased from 158,741 (week 1, January 4-10, 2021) to 152,064 (week 2, January 11-17, 2021), and cumulative cases increased from 22,507,271 (week 1) to 23,890,761 (week 2), with a weekly increase of 1,383,490 between January 10 and January 17. France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom had the largest 7-day moving averages for new cases during week 1. During week 2, the 7-day moving average for France and Spain increased. From week 1 to week 2, the speed decreased (37.72 to 33.02 per 100,000), acceleration decreased (0.39 to –0.16 per 100,000), and jerk increased (–1.30 to 1.37 per 100,000). CONCLUSIONS: The United Kingdom, Spain, and Portugal, in particular, are at risk for a rapid expansion in COVID-19 transmission. An examination of the European region suggests that there was a decrease in the COVID-19 caseload between January 4 and January 17, 2021. Unfortunately, the rates of jerk, which were negative for Europe at the beginning of the month, reversed course and became positive, despite decreases in speed and acceleration. Finally, the 7-day persistence rate was higher during week 2 than during week 1. These measures indicate that the second wave of the pandemic may be subsiding, but some countries remain at risk for new outbreaks and increased transmission in the absence of rapid policy responses.","Post, Lori; Culler, Kasen; Moss, Charles B; Murphy, Robert L; Achenbach, Chad J; Ison, Michael G; Resnick, Danielle; Singh, Lauren Nadya; White, Janine; Boctor, Michael J; Welch, Sarah B; Oehmke, James Francis",JMIR Public Health Surveill,131,29

Online learning has its own limitations, which are further amplified if not implemented properly. Hence, there is a need to assess various barriers faced in the implementation of effective online learning. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to identify the barriers and motivators in online learning among medical undergraduates. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This internet-based cross-sectional study was conducted among medical undergraduates of Punjab. The data collection tool was a semi-structured self-made questionnaire prepared using “Google Forms,” which was then circulated in the WhatsApp groups of the students. Received responses were imported to the Microsoft Excel sheet and statistical analysis was done. RESULTS: Out of the 592 participants, 533 (90%) faced some kind of problem in online learning. Major among them were lack of personal interaction with teachers (52%), distractions at home (43.6%), technology failure (43.2%), limited access to the Internet (39.2%), visual fatigue (38.5%), and increased workload (25%). Benefits perceived were the comfortable environment of home (41%), easy accessibility of recorded lectures (36.8%), and the opportunity to keep in touch with studies (35%). CONCLUSIONS: The online learning process is not a replacement for routine classroom teaching and clinical postings in medical education. However, it can supplement routine teaching, especially during current COVID-19 pandemic-like situations. Most of the students (90%) were facing some kind of difficulty in the online learning process due to unplanned and sudden shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to identify and eliminate the various barriers to make online learning effective.","Kaur, Harjot; Singh, Amandeep; Mahajan, Sanjeev; Lal, Mohan; Singh, Gagandeep; Kaur, Prabhjot",J Educ Health Promot,131,32

With advancements in high throughput -omics technology, such as metabolomics, epidemiology can now delve more deeply and comprehensively into biological mechanisms involved in the etiology of diseases. However, the impact of the blood collection tube matrix of samples collected needs to be carefully considered to obtain meaningful biological interpretations and understand how the metabolite signatures are affected by different tube types. In the present study, we investigated whether the metabolic profile of blood collected as serum differed from samples collected as ACD plasma, citrate plasma, EDTA plasma, fluoride plasma, or heparin plasma. We identified and quantified 50 metabolites present in all samples utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The heparin plasma tubes performed the closest to serum, with only three metabolites showing significant differences, followed by EDTA which significantly differed for five metabolites, and fluoride tubes which differed in eleven of the fifty metabolites. Most of these metabolite differences were due to higher levels of amino acids in serum compared to heparin plasma, EDTA plasma, and fluoride plasma. In contrast, metabolite measurements from ACD and citrate plasma differed significantly for approximately half of the metabolites assessed. These metabolite differences in ACD and citrate plasma were largely due to significant interfering peaks from the anticoagulants themselves. Blood is one of the most banked samples and thus mining and comparing samples between studies requires understanding how the metabolite signature is affected by the different media and different tube types.","Sotelo-Orozco, Jennie; Chen, Shin-Yu; Hertz-Picciotto, Irva; Slupsky, Carolyn M.",Front Mol Biosci,131,23

However, existing empirical evidence is limited and exclusively focuses on few large cities in the U.S. This study examines the effects of Airbnb on housing rental and sales prices using a unique large-scale dataset comprised of housing market transaction records and the number of Airbnb listings drawn from their website in Taiwan. We estimate a fixed effect model of housing rental and sales price equations and find that a one-standard deviation increase in the number of Airbnb listings raises house rental prices by 0.38%. This finding suggests that a substitution effect is present between Airbnb's short-term accommodation and the housing rental market. Moreover, a larger effect on rental price is found among Airbnb listings that offer an entire room or apartment. Additionally, since September 2017, multinational digital platform companies must comply with a new sales tax policy in Taiwan. We evaluate the effect of this tax policy using the difference-in-difference method and find a negative impact on the number of Airbnb listings and housing rental prices after its implementation.

We observe point displays and leader boards, the visible assumption of roles, classic archetypes, the collection of resources, and spatial awareness. We argue that these patterns manifest spontaneously as a form of analogical reasoning, because people lack cultural and individual norms as well as cognitive scripts for a pandemic. Trying to find systematic similarities between a novel and a familiar situation is an essential cognitive strategy and a cultural tool, resulting in a spontaneous ludification of this crisis. Unfortunately, most institutions, the media and policymakers focus on attributes that are easy to communicate, not on relations and causal chains. This results in shallow analogies, where the mechanisms and dynamics of COVID-19 are not addressed. This can cause a sense of helplessness, where many people remain passive viewers. A pandemic, however, calls for cooperative action of people who understand the relations between different factors and stakeholders in order to mitigate several negative effects linked to such a crisis. We propose a psychologically founded “Strategic gamification” (here in the context of a pandemic), a form of sense-making that builds on spontaneously emerging ludic elements. By extending upon those elements through the lens of game design, we can shape the mechanics, dynamics and esthetics of a serious context in a more meaningful way. The resulting analogies have better predictive power and are suited to utilize positive aspects of gamification like engagement, elaboration and collaboration.","Raab, Marius Hans; Döbler, Niklas Alexander; Carbon, Claus-Christian",Front Psychol,131,1

B-cell lymphoma is unique in this context as tumor cells express TLR9 and may harbor latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a gamma-herpesvirus with remarkable oncogenic potential when latent. Latent EBV may be promoted by TLR9 triggering via suppression of lytic EBV. Here, we elaborated an initial assessment of the impact of TLR9 triggering on EBV-positive and EBV-negative B-cell lymphoma using Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell lines as an in vitro model. We show that, independent of the presence of EBV, the TLR9 ligand oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) CpG-2006 may or may not induce caspase-dependent cell death in BL cells. Moreover, ODN CpG-2006-induced cell death responses of BL cells were associated with TLR9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs5743836 or rs352140, which we detected in primary BL tumors and in peripheral blood from healthy individuals at similar frequencies. Thus, our findings suggest that the effect of TLR9 agonists on BL cells should be tested in vitro before installment of therapy and TLR9 SNPs in BL patients should be determined as potential biological markers for the therapeutic response to treatment targeting innate immunity.","Noack, J; Jordi, M; Zauner, L; Alessi, D; Burch, A; Tinguely, M; Hersberger, M; Bernasconi, M; Nadal, D",Cell Death Dis,131,1

Using questionnaires is an alternative to labor-intensive diagnostic interviews in a large general population, but previous models for predicting suicide attempts suffered from low sensitivity. We developed and validated a deep graph neural network model that increased the prediction sensitivity of suicide risk in young adults (n = 17,482 for training;n = 14,238 for testing) using multi-dimensional questionnaires and suicidal ideation within 2 weeks as the prediction target. The best model achieved a sensitivity of 76.3%, specificity of 83.4%, and an area under curve of 0.878 (95% confidence interval, 0.855–0.899). We demonstrated that multi-dimensional deep features covering depression, anxiety, resilience, self-esteem, and clinico-demographic information contribute to the prediction of suicidal ideation.

EchA is a polyhydroxylated 1,4-naphthoquinone that contains several hydroxyl groups appropriate for free-radical scavenging and preventing redox imbalance. EchA is the most studied molecule of this family and is an active principle approved to be used in humans, usually for cardiopathies and glaucoma. EchA is used as a pharmaceutical drug. Methods: A comprehensive literature and patent search review was undertaken using PubMed, as well as Google Scholar and Espacenet search engines to review these areas. Conclusions: In the bloodstream, EchA can mediate cellular responses, act as a radical scavenger, and activate the glutathione pathway. It decreases ROS imbalance, prevents and limits lipid peroxidation, and enhances mitochondrial functions. Most importantly, EchA contributes to the modulation of the immune system. EchA can regulate the generation of regulatory T cells, inhibit pro-inflammatory IL-1β and IL-6 cytokine production, while slightly reducing IL-8, TNF-α, INF-α, and NKT, thus correcting immune imbalance. These characteristics suggest that EchA is a candidate drug to alleviate the cytokine storm syndrome (CSS).","Rubilar, Tamara; Barbieri, Elena S.; Gazquez, Ayelén; Avaro, Marisa",Mar Drugs,131,1

If early pregnancy sequela in the current COVID-19 pandemic are modeled from the 2004 Coronavirus outbreak data, then SARS-CoV-2 infection proximate to blastocyst nidation is likely to cause implantation failure or spontaneous abortion. Our model explains why this outcome is less attributable to virus-associated maternal pulmonary distress and instead derives from systemic inflammation and interference with trophectoderm-endometrium molecular signaling required for implantation. COVID-19 is often accompanied by high levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha and other cytokines, a process implicated in pulmonary collapse and systemic organ failure. Yet when regarded in an early reproductive context, this “cytokine storm” of COVID-19 triggers a pro-coagulative state hostile to normal in utero blastocyst/fetal development. Evidence from obstetrics is accumulating to show that mothers with SARS-CoV-2 deliver placentas with abnormal interstitial villi fibrin deposits, diffuse infarcts, and hemangiomatous changes. This model classifies such lesions as permissive at term but catastrophic near embryo implantation or early first trimester pregnancy. Clinical experience with recurrent pregnancy loss offers workable interventions to address this challenge, but success will depend on prompt and accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Although no professional guidelines currently exist for SARS-CoV-2 in early pregnancy, this model would warrant a high-risk designation for such cases; these patients should receive priority access to screening and treatment resources.","Sills, Eric Scott; Wood, Samuel Horace",Int J Mol Cell Med,131,20

Its accuracy was tested against experimental data from COVID-19 patients. Our model predicts that only some SARS-CoV-2 epitopes predicted to bind to HLA molecules are immunogenic. The immunogenic CTL epitopes across all SARS-CoV-2 proteins are predicted to provide broad population coverage, but those from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein alone are unlikely to do so.

Multiple HIV testing programs have been implemented in EDs across the United States with varying designs and testing platforms. We report findings from a free, non‐targeted, rapid HIV testing program in 2 EDs in the Southeastern United States. METHODS: From 2008 to 2012, adults ≥18 years of age were offered free rapid HIV testing using an oral swab test (OraQuick ADVANCE Rapid HIV‐1/2 antibody test) in the EDs of a large academic medical center and an affiliated community hospital in Durham, North Carolina. RESULTS: In total, 5443 ED patients were offered HIV testing. The overall acceptance rate was 66.9% (3639/5443). Younger persons were significantly more likely to accept testing (78.2% for 18–29 years old vs 67.1% for ≥30 years old; P < 0.001) as were Black participants (72.6% Black vs 66.5% White; P < 0.001). Acceptance rates improved significantly after opt‐out oral consent replaced written consent (71.3% vs 63.1%; P < 0.001). Seven new HIV diagnoses were confirmed during the testing program, resulting in a seropositivity rate of 0.19% (7/3639). There were 8 false–positive rapid oral HIV tests (positive predictive value = 46.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of new HIV diagnoses was low, implementation of this rapid, non‐targeted ED screening program was feasible with high acceptance rates, particularly after introducing the opt‐out oral consent approach.","Safeek, Rachel; Hill, Tamsey; Hendricks, Arthur; Underwood, David; Washington, Mary; Guidici, Jessica; Wong, Tammy; Gerardo, Charles; Hicks, Charles; McKellar, Mehri",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,131,16

Effective prodrug forms distribute their payload to the site of the intended target and release it efficiently with minimal byproduct toxicity. The ability to balance unwanted payload release during transit with desired release at the site of action is critical to prodrug efficacy. Despite decades of research on prodrug forms, choosing the ideal prodrug form remains a challenge which is often solved empirically. The recent emergency use authorization of the antiviral remdesivir for COVID-19 exemplifies a new approach for delivery of phosphate prodrugs by parenteral dosing, which minimizes payload release during transit and maximizes tissue payload distribution. This review focuses on the role of metabolic activation in efficacy during oral and parenteral dosing of phosphate, phosphonate, and phosphinate prodrugs. Through examining prior structure–activity studies on prodrug forms and the choices that led to development of remdesivir and other clinical drugs and drug candidates, a better understanding of their ability to distribute to the planned site of action, such as the liver, plasma, PBMCs, or peripheral tissues, can be gained. The structure–activity relationships described here will facilitate the rational design of future prodrugs.","Wiemer, Andrew J.",ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci,131,1

Conversely, little is known about the clinical course of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and simultaneous SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHOD: The Italian Society of Hospital Neurosciences (SNO) promoted a multicentre, retrospective, observational study (SNO-COVID-19), involving 20 Neurological Departments in Northern Italy. Clinical data on patients with acute cerebrovascular diseases, admitted from March 1st to April 30th, 2020, were collected. A comparison was made of the demographical and clinical features of both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients with ICH. RESULTS: 949 patients were enrolled (average age 73.4 years; 52.7% males); 135 patients had haemorrhagic stroke and 127 (13.4%) had a primary ICH. Only 16 patients with ICH (12.6%) had laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, both symptomatic and asymptomatic. SARS-CoV-2 related pneumonia or respiratory distress (OR 5.4), lobar location (OR 5.0) and previous antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment (OR 2.9) were the only factors significantly associated with increased mortality in ICH. SARS-CoV-2 infection, regardless of respiratory involvement, led to a non-significantly increased risk of in-hospital death (37.5% vs 23.4%, p = 0.2). DISCUSSION: ICH patients with COVID-19 did not experience an increase in mortality as striking as ischemic stroke. The inflammatory response and respiratory complications could justify the slight increase of death in ICH. Bleeding sites and previous antiplatelet or anticoagulant treatment were the only other predictors of a worse outcome.","Sangalli, Davide; Martinelli-Boneschi, Filippo; Versino, Maurizio; Colombo, Irene; Ciccone, Alfonso; Beretta, Simone; Marcheselli, Simona; Altavilla, Riccardo; Roncoroni, Mauro; Beretta, Sandro; Lorusso, Lorenzo; Cavallini, Anna; Prelle, Alessandro; Guidetti, Donata; La Gioia, Sara; Santalucia, Paola; Zanferrari, Carla; Grampa, Giampiero; D'Adda, Elisabetta; Peverelli, Lorenzo; Colombo, Antonio; Salmaggi, Andrea",J Neurol Sci,131,28

The presence of radiologic findings of bronchiectasis should alert clinicians to explore other causes including congenital defects, chronic inflammation, immune deficiencies, opportunistic infections and assess functional lung capacity as multiple etiologies contributed to bronchiectasis in our patient. We present the case of a middle-aged Hispanic male diagnosed with bronchiectasis in the setting of active Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), and cystic fibrosis carrier. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old Hispanic male with a history of SARS-CoV 2 infection presented with worsening cough and fatigue. He reported subjective fever, night sweats, weight loss, and yellowish sputum production. CT chest showed diffuse bronchial dilatation and thickening, diffuse bronchiectasis, multifocal cavitary lesions in bilateral upper lobes, and tree in bud nodularity. QuantiFERON-TB Gold was indeterminate. However, acid fast bacilli was seen on smear and culture. PCR confirmed MTB complex. He was found to have low IgG and IgM levels 661 and 26 respectively. Genetic testing showed a heterozygous cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) D508 gene mutation. He was treated with quadruple therapy with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and referred to an immunologist for immunoglobulin therapy. DISCUSSION: Bronchiectasis is a cycle of airway damage creating an environment conductive to chronic colonization of bacteria causing an inflammatory response leading to further injury. Our biggest diagnostic challenge was to determine if bronchiectasis was due to an infection or developed due to an underlying predisposition. His clinical symptoms were worrisome for tuberculosis;however, diffuse bronchial dilation was concerning for other concurrent pathologies which warranted further work up. Bronchiectasis may be classified as cystic fibrosis induced bronchiectasis and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB). Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder. While bronchiectasis is classically associated in CF patients, it has also been reported in patients having one gene mutation, like our patient. Furthermore, MTB and CVID are also documented causes of bronchiectasis. Pharmacological treatment is challenging and depends on the etiology. However, non-pharmacological treatment, such as chest physiotherapy centered on mobilizing and eliminating mucosal secretion, is used to manage bronchiectasis. CONCLUSIONS: The rise in the incidence of bronchiectasis in the US annually demands the understanding of the disease's etiology and characteristic features as effective treatment is directed towards its cause.

METHODS: We recruited healthcare workers receiving the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine at the Chiba University Hospital COVID-19 Vaccine Center. Blood samples were obtained before the 1(st) dose and after the 2(nd) dose vaccination, and serum antibody titers were determined using Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2S, an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. We established a model to identify the baseline factors predicting post-vaccine antibody titers using univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Two thousand fifteen individuals (median age 37-year-old, 64.3% female) were enrolled in this study, of which 10 had a history of COVID-19. Before vaccination, 21 participants (1.1%) had a detectable antibody titer (≥0.4 U/mL) with a median titer of 35.9 U/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 7.8 – 65.7). After vaccination, serum anti-SARS-CoV-2S antibodies (≥0.4 U/mL) were detected in all 1,774 participants who received the 2(nd) dose with a median titer of 2,060.0 U/mL (IQR 1,250.0 – 2,650.0). Immunosuppressive medication (p<0.001), age (p<0.001), time from 2(nd) dose to sample collection (p<0.001), glucocorticoids (p=0.020), and drinking alcohol (p=0.037) were identified as factors predicting lower antibody titers after vaccination, whereas previous COVID-19 (p<0.001), female (p<0.001), time between 2 doses (p<0.001), and medication for allergy (p=0.024) were identified as factors predicting higher serum antibody titers.

Therapeutic judgment under uncertainty and imperfect information may be influenced by personal preference, whereby individuals, to confirm a-priori beliefs, may propose drugs without knowing the clinical benefit. To estimate this disconnect between available evidence and prescribing behavior, we created a Bayesian model analyzing a-priori optimistic belief of physicians in Hydroxychloroquine's effectiveness. Methodology: We created a Bayesian model to simulate the impact of different a-priori beliefs related to Hydroxychloroquine's effectiveness on clinical and economic outcome. Results: Our hypothetical results indicate no significant difference in treatment effect (combined survival benefit and harm) up to a presumed drug's effectiveness level of 20%, with younger individuals being negatively affected by the treatment (RR 0.82, 0.55–1.2; (0.95 (1.1) % expected adverse events versus 0.05 (0.98) % expected death prevented). Simulated cost data indicate overall hospital cost (medicine, hospital stay, complication) of 18.361,41€ per hospitalized patient receiving Hydroxychloroquine treatment.

Therefore, it is important to understand the global scientific output of COVID-19 research during the early stage of the outbreak. Thus, to track the current hotspots, and highlight future directions, we performed a bibliometric analysis to obtain an approximate scenario of COVID-19 to date. METHODS: Relevant studies to COVID-19 were obtained from the Scopus database during the early stage of the outbreak. We then analysed the data by using well-established bibliometric indices: document type, country, collaboration patterns, affiliation, journal name, and citation patterns. VOSviewer was applied to map and determine hot topics in this field. RESULTS: The bibliometric analysis indicated that there were 19,044 publications on Scopus published on COVID-19 during the early stage of the outbreak (December 2019 up until June 19, 2020). Of all these publications, 9140 (48.0%) were articles; 4192 (22.0%) were letters; 1797 (9.4%) were reviews; 1754 (9.2%) were editorials; 1728 (9.1%) were notes; and 433 (2.3%) were others. The USA published the largest number of publications on COVID-19 (4479; 23.4%), followed by China (3310; 17.4%), Italy, (2314; 12.2%), and the UK (1981; 10.4%). British Medical Journal was the most productive. The Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Tongji Medical, and Harvard Medical School were the institutions that published the largest number of COVID-19 research. The most prevalent topics of research in COVID-19 include “clinical features studies”, “pathological findings and therapeutic design”, “care facilities preparation and infection control”, and “maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes”. CONCLUSIONS: This bibliometric study may reflect rapidly emerging topics on COVID-19 research, where substantial research activity has already begun extensively during the early stage of the outbreak. The findings reported here shed new light on the major progress in the near future for hot topics on COVID-19 research including clinical features studies, pathological findings and therapeutic design, care facilities preparation and infection control, and maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes.","Zyoud, Sa’ed H.; Al-Jabi, Samah W.",BMC Infect Dis,131,28

Clinical studies, however, cannot provide the controlled response to infection and complex immunological insight that are only possible with preclinical studies. Hamsters are the only model that reliably exhibit severe SARS-CoV-2 disease similar to hospitalized patients, making them pertinent for vaccine evaluation. We demonstrate that prime or prime-boost administration of mRNA-1273 in hamsters elicited robust neutralizing antibodies, ameliorated weight loss, suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication in the airways, and better protected against disease at the highest prime-boost dose. Unlike in mice and non-human primates, low level virus replication in mRNA-1273 vaccinated hamsters coincided with an anamnestic response. Single-cell RNA sequencing of lung tissue permitted high resolution analysis which is not possible in vaccinated humans. mRNA-1273 prevented inflammatory cell infiltration and the reduction of lymphocyte proportions, but enabled antiviral responses conducive to lung homeostasis. Surprisingly, infection triggered transcriptome programs in some types of immune cells from vaccinated hamsters that were shared, albeit attenuated, with mock-vaccinated hamsters. Our results support the use of mRNA-1273 in a two-dose schedule and provide insight into the potential responses within the lungs of vaccinated humans who are exposed to SARS-CoV-2.","Meyer, Michelle; Wang, Yuan; Edwards, Darin; Smith, Gregory R; Rubenstein, Aliza B; Ramanathan, Palaniappan; Mire, Chad E; Pietzsch, Colette; Chen, Xi; Ge, Yongchao; Cheng, Wan Sze; Henry, Carole; Woods, Angela; Ma, LingZhi; Stewart-Jones, Guillaume Be; Bock, Kevin W; Minai, Mahnaz; Nagata, Bianca M; Periasamy, Sivakumar; Shi, Pei-Yong; Graham, Barney S; Moore, Ian N; Ramos, Irene; Troyanskaya, Olga G; Zaslavsky, Elena; Carfi, Andrea; Sealfon, Stuart C; Bukreyev, Alexander",The Journal of clinical investigation,131,14

It is often assumed that citizens have a strong desire to know their Covid–19 status, and will therefore take advantage of testing opportunities. This may not be the case in all contexts, however, especially those where citizens perceive stigma associated with the Covid–19, have low trust in health institutions, and doubt the procedural integrity of the testing process. This article explores willingness to receive a free Covid–19 test via a vignette experiment (conjoint design) embedded in a phone survey conducted in Malawi in May 2020. The experiment varied test provider (public clinic versus international health organization), proximity to illness, and a confidentiality reassurance. We find that Malawians expect higher uptake of testing in their community when the international health organization offered the test rather than a public clinic, an effect we attribute to higher trust in the organization and/or perceptions of greater capacity to ensure procedural integrity. The confidentiality reassurance did not substantially alter beliefs about the privacy of results, but did increase doubts about the willingness of community members to get tested in a public health clinic. Our findings suggest the importance of considering the demand side of testing in addition to well-known challenges of supply.","Ferree, Karen; Harris, Adam; Dulani, Boniface; Kao, Kristen; Lust, Ellen; Metheney, Erica",World Dev,131,20

A small group of bacteria appear to predominate in ABRS, and these bacteria are empirically susceptible to tetracycline antibiotics, barring the presence of resistant strains. Historically, clinicians have mixed tetracycline with various biomaterials or hydrated biomaterials in a dilute tetracycline solution in the treatment of periodontal disease and for ridge preservation/augmentation indications. CASE PRESENTATION: In the present case, a 39‐year‐old African‐American male with sinus graft infection and signs and symptoms consistent with ABRS was successfully treated by removing the initial graft material, thoroughly debriding and irrigating the antrum, and placing a freeze‐dried bone allograft hydrated in an aqueous tetracycline solution. CONCLUSION: Given the typical bacteria present in ABRS, locally applied tetracycline may be useful prophylactically in sinus elevation surgery or as an adjunct in managing postoperative sinus graft infection.","Johnson, Thomas M.; Lincicum, Adam R.",Clin Adv Periodontics,131,1

Hence, laboratories worldwide are developing an effective vaccine against this disease, which will be essential to reduce morbidity and mortality. Currently, there more than 64 vaccine candidates, most of them aiming to induce neutralizing antibodies against the spike protein (S). These antibodies will prevent uptake through the human ACE-2 receptor, thereby limiting viral entrance. Different vaccine platforms are being used for vaccine development, each one presenting several advantages and disadvantages. Thus far, thirteen vaccine candidates are being tested in Phase 3 clinical trials; therefore, it is closer to receiving approval or authorization for large-scale immunizations.","Kyriakidis, Nikolaos C.; López-Cortés, Andrés; González, Eduardo Vásconez; Grimaldos, Alejandra Barreto; Prado, Esteban Ortiz",NPJ Vaccines,131,16

In September 2019, we collected data from a nationally representative sample of workers to profile the quality of work and economic life. Then, during a critical period of widespread economic and social shockwaves, we re-interviewed these same study participants in May 2020 to evaluate change. We observe that the strong positive association between WLC and unjustly low pay decreased overall in the population—but the strength and direction of that association differed significantly across several dimensions of social stratification. Specifically, we found a weaker relationship among visible minorities, younger workers, and individuals with lower socioeconomic status. We interpret these patterns as suggesting that—at least among more vulnerable groups—the “greed” represented in the process of work interfering with non-work was unevenly experienced during peak period of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Schieman, Scott; Narisada, Atsushi",Res Soc Stratif Mobil,131,18

El 14 de marzo el Gobierno español estableció el estado de alarma. La única información acerca del número de casos de Covid-19 eran los confirmados por RT-PCR. Lanzamos una herramienta de vigilancia basada en la web para estimar el número mínimo de casos sintomáticos de Covid-19 y generar información útil para la toma de decisiones en salud pública. Material y métodos: Implementamos un cuestionario web anónimo y lo difundimos a través de redes sociales. Recopilamos información epidemiológica sobre variables de “tiempo” (fecha de inicio de los síntomas), “lugar” (código postal) y “persona” (género, edad). Comparamos los casos positivos detectados mediante RT-PCR con los casos estimados según la definición de caso del Ministerio de Sanidad Consumo y Bienestar Social. Calculamos la tasa de respuesta al cuestionario y la incidencia acumulada a 14 días. Resultados: Entre el 19 y 26 de marzo de 2020, el cuestionario fue contestado por 128.182 personas (5,5% de la población vasca).De ellas 27.599 cumplieron la definición de caso. Los casos estimados fueron seis veces más que los RT-PCR positivos para COVID-19. La incidencia acumulada a 14 días fue de 463,3 por 100.000 habitantes comparada con la de los casos positivos por RT-PCR que fue de 139,6 por 100.000 habitantes. Conclusiones: Esta herramienta mostró su utilidad para estimar el mínimo número de casos sintomáticos en Euskadi lo cual podría apoyar aciones de salud pública. Summary Objective: In the Basque Country, two cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed on February 28 2020. On March 14, the Spanish Government established a state of alarm. Only cases confirmed by molecular biology (reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) were known. We launched a web-based surveillance tool to estimate the number of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 to contribute to Public Health decision-making. Material and methods: We implemented an anonymous web questionnaire and disseminated it through online social media social. We collected epidemiological information about ""time"" (date of onset of symptoms), ""place"" (zip code), and ""person"" (gender, age). We compared cases detected by RT-PCR with the estimated cases, according to the case definition of the Ministry of Health. We calculated the questionnaire response rate and the cumulative incidence at 14 days. Results: Between March 19 and 26, 128,009 people answered the questionnaire (5.5% of the Basque population). Of these, 26,375 met the case definition (symptom prevalence of 21.4%). The estimated cases were almost six times more than COVID-19 positive RT-PCR. The estimated 14-day cumulative incidence was 578.3 per 100,000 population compared to RT-PCR positive cases, which was 139.6 per 100,000 population. Conclusions: This tool was useful in estimating the minimum number of symptomatic cases in the Basque Country, which could support Public Health actions.","Garitano, Ignacio; Linaresa, Manuel; Santosa, Laura; Santamaría, Virginia; Galicia, Fabio; Ramos, José M.",Semergen,131,18

Restrictions to the movement of people and goods have impaired access to markets, services and food. Unlike other concurrent crises, rather than threatening the material hardware of food systems, COVID-19 has so far affected the ‘software’ of food systems, highlighting again that connectivity is at the heart of these systems. Drops in demand, the loss of markets and employment and growing concerns about international cooperation are indications of possible deeper disruptions to come. Amidst this uncertainty, strategies to safeguard food and nutrition security of the world’s poor need to prioritize diversification of production and markets. Nutritious, biofortified crops such as potato, sweetpotato, but also wheat, maize and beans among others, can play a more significant role to provide key micronutrients (vitamin A, iron, zinc) at large scale. Strong local market chains, robust smallholder production systems and increasing commercial utilization make these crops powerful vehicles for securing nutrition when markets and mobility look uncertain. We posit that the evolving impacts of COVID-19 provide an opportunity to focus agricultural innovations, including the development and delivery of biofortified crops, on new and more specifically defined ‘jobs to be done’ throughout the food system. This will help bridge some of the current disruptions in supply and demand and will help prepare food systems for future crises.","Heck, Simon; Campos, Hugo; Barker, Ian; Okello, Julius J.; Baral, Arun; Boy, Erick; Brown, Lynn; Birol, Ekin",Food Secur,131,5

Despite the efforts, the understanding of the many facets of the pandemic is still rather limited. In the present manuscript, we have monitored the evolution of the lethality rate in Italy by using the data collected over the last three months. Our data indicate that there is a striking correlation between the number of infected people of a certain week and the deaths of the following one. Despite the overall simplicity of the applied approach and its many approximations, the analysis of the Italian scenario provides some interesting insights into the pandemic. Indeed, we have found that the lethality rate is virtually unchanged over the last two months. This implies that the reduction of the deaths is strictly connected to the decrease of cases. Unfortunately, the present study does not support the idea that the virus potency has lowered in the last weeks, as our data demonstrate that the likelihood of a fatal outcome after the infection has not decreased in the recent outbreak evolution. Moreover, we show that the lethality rate is still very high in the country ({approx}13.5%). Since this number is remarkably higher if compared to the actual lethality estimates made worldwide, this finding suggests that the number of detected cases may be a gross underestimation of the actual infected people, likely due to the presence of a significant number of non-symptomatic or paucisymptomatic individuals in the population.","Balasco, N.; d'Alessandro, V.; Smaldone, G.; Vitagliano, L.",,131,1

Experiments have been carried out using PBMCs of 10 different healthy donors. The results showed that the antiviral activity of IFN contained in the supernatant of SARS-CoV-infected PBMCs was lower than those induced by VSV and NDV. Consequently, SARS-CoV induces a lower synthesis of IFN-α, -β and -γ compared to VSV and NDV. Characterization of the profile of IFN-α subtypes genes expression in SARS-CoV-infected PBMCs demonstrated that the level of IFN-α2 and −6 subtypes were higher compared to other IFN-α subtypes namely, IFN-α5, −8, −10, −13/1, −17, and −21. In conclusion, SARS-CoV induces IFNs to a less extent compared to VSV and NDV, thus suggesting that the IFN system does play a limited role in early host defense against SARS-CoV infection.","Scagnolari, Carolina; Trombetti, Simona; Cicetti, Simona; Antonelli, Silvia; Selvaggi, Carla; Perrone, Lorena; Visca, Michela; Romano, Sara; Antonelli, Guido",Intervirology,131,30

Concrete production is responsible for significant energy consumption and CO(2) production; therefore, it is necessary to look for new solutions in which components are replaced by other materials, preferably recycled. A positive way is to use glass waste. In order to determine the effect of a significant glass cullet content on the properties of concrete, glass powder was used as a filler and 100% glass aggregate. The cement–glass composite has low tensile strength and brittle failure. In order to improve tensile strength, the effects of adding polypropylene fibres on the mechanical properties of the composite were investigated.

In this study, we reported a surface-enhanced Raman scattering-based lateral flow immunoassay (SERS-LFIA) for the simultaneous detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG with high sensitivity. Novel SERS tags labeled with dual layers of Raman dye were fabricated by coating a complete Ag shell on SiO(2) core (SiO(2)@Ag) and exhibited excellent SERS signals, good monodispersity, and high stability. Anti-human IgM and IgG were immobilized onto the two test lines of the strip to capture the formed SiO(2)@Ag-spike (S) protein-anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG immunocomplexes. The SERS signal intensities of the IgM and IgG test zones were easily recorded by a portable Raman instrument and used for the high-sensitivity analysis of target IgM and IgG. The limit of detection of SERS-LFIA was 800 times higher than that of standard Au nanoparticle-based LFIA for target IgM and IgG. The SERS-LFIA biosensor was tested on 19 positive serum samples from COVID-19 patients and 49 negative serum samples from healthy people to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of our proposed assay. The results revealed that the proposed method exhibited high accuracy and specificity for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Liu, Haifeng; Dai, Erhei; Xiao, Rui; Zhou, Zihui; Zhang, Minli; Bai, Zikun; Shao, Ying; Qi, Kezong; Tu, Jian; Wang, Chongwen; Wang, Shengqi",Sens Actuators B Chem,131,21

When compared to solid tumors (98%), a significantly lower rate of seroconversion was observed in patients with hematological malignancies (85%), particularly recipients of anti-CD20 therapies (70%) and stem cell transplantation (74%). Patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (97%) or hormonal therapies (100%) demonstrated high seroconversion post-vaccination. Patients with prior COVID-19 infection demonstrated higher anti-spike IgG titers post-vaccination. Relatively lower IgG titers were noted following vaccination with the adenoviral when compared to the mRNA-based vaccines.

The aim of the present study was to describe the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at 90 days after ICU discharge in a cohort of COVID-19 patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and to compare it with an age and sex-matched sample from the general Italian and Finnish populations. Moreover, the possible associations between clinical, demographic, social factors, and HRQoL were investigated. METHODS: COVID-19 ARDS survivors from 16 participating ICUs were followed up until 90 days after ICU discharge and the HRQoL was evaluated with the 15D instrument. A parallel cohort of age and sex-matched Italian population from the same geographic areas was interviewed and a third group of matched Finnish population was extracted from the Finnish 2011 National Health survey. A linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate potential associations between the evaluated factors and HRQoL. RESULTS: 205 patients answered to the questionnaire. HRQoL of the COVID-19 ARDS patients was significantly lower than the matched populations in both physical and mental dimensions. Age, sex, number of comorbidities, ARDS class, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, and occupational status were found to be significant determinants of the 90 days HRQoL. Clinical severity at ICU admission was poorly correlated to HRQoL. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related ARDS survivors at 90 days after ICU discharge present a significant reduction both on physical and psychological dimensions of HRQoL measured with the 15D instrument.
