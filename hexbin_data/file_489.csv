We sought to determine whether bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with lung injury contained mediators that would activate procollagen I promoter and if this activation predicted important clinical outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective controlled study of ALI/ARDS. SETTING: Intensive care units and laboratory of a university hospital. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Acute lung injury/ARDS, cardiogenic edema (negative controls) and pulmonary fibrosis (positive controls) patients. INTERVENTIONS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected within 48 h of intubation from ALI/ARDS patients. BALF was also collected from patients with pulmonary fibrosis and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Human lung fibroblasts were transfected with a procollagen I promoter-luciferase construct and incubated with BALF; procollagen I promoter activity was then measured. BALF active TGF-β1 levels were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Twenty-nine ARDS patients, nine negative and six positive controls were enrolled. BALF from ARDS patients induced 41% greater procollagen I promoter activation than that from negative controls (p<0.05) and a TGF-β1 blocking antibody significantly reduced this activation in ARDS patients. There was a trend toward higher TGF-β1 levels in the ARDS group compared to negative controls (−1.056 log(10)±0.1415 vs −1.505 log(10)±0.1425) (p<0.09). Procollagen I promoter activation was not associated with mortality; however, lower TGF-β1 levels were associated with more ventilator-free and ICU-free days. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from ALI/ARDS patients activates procollagen I promoter, which is due partly to TGF-β1. Activated TGF-β1 may impact ARDS outcome independent of its effect on procollagen I activation.

5932,5932,5932,Mechanisms of pulmonary edema clearance: from basic research to clinical implication,20.610544,11.3627205,2000,"The authors have previously reported that adoptive transfer of splenocytes suppresses murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) brain infection following intracerebroventricular injection of immunodeficient mice and that depletion of Thy 1.2(+) T lymphocytes abolishes this suppressive effect. Here the authors report that splenocytes depleted of CD4(+) T lymphocytes prior to adoptive transfer retained their ability to control viral expression in the brain. In sharp contrast, depletion of the CD8(+) T-cell population prior to transfer abolished the suppressive effect, with sixfold greater expression in the brain than when undepleted splenocytes were used. The authors went on to examine the contributions of cytokine- and perforin-mediated mechanisms in controlling MCMV brain infection using splenocytes from major histocompatibility (MHC)-matched IFN-γ-knockout (GKO), and perforin-knockout (PKO) mice. When used in adoptive transfer studies, splenocytes from GKO mice controlled viral expression; however, cells from PKO mice could not control reporter gene expression or viral DNA replication in brain tissues. The authors have previously reported that the levels of the T-cell chemoattractant CXCL10 are highly elevated in the brains of MCMV-infected mice. Here the authors found that the receptor for this ligand, CXCR3, was not essential in mediating the suppressive effects of adoptive transfer. These data indicate that peripheral CD8(+) T cells control MCMV brain infection through a perforin-mediated mechanism and that neither IFN-γ nor CXCR3 play a critical role in this neuroprotective response.","Cheeran, Maxim C. -J.; Gekker, Genya; Hu, Shuxian; Palmquist, Joseph M.; Lokensgard, James R.",J Neurovirol,489,12

One possible reason is that the cellular and chemical composition of the epithelial lining fluid may inhibit amikacin-mediated bacterial killing. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify whether the epithelial lining fluid components inhibit amikacin-mediated bacterial killing. METHODS: Two amikacin-susceptible (minimum inhibitory concentrations of 2 and 8 mg/L) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were exposed in vitro to amikacin concentrations up to 976 mg/L in the presence of an acidic pH, mucin and/or surfactant as a means of simulating the epithelial lining fluid, the site of bacterial infection in pneumonia. Pharmacodynamic modelling was used to describe associations between amikacin concentrations, bacterial killing and emergence of resistance. RESULTS: In the presence of broth alone, there was rapid and extensive (> 6 − log(10)) bacterial killing, with emergence of resistance identified in amikacin concentrations < 976 mg/L. In contrast, the rate and extent of bacterial killing was reduced (≤ 5 − log(10)) when exposed to an acidic pH and mucin. Surfactant did not appreciably impact the bacterial killing or resistance emergence when compared with broth alone for either isolate. The combination of mucin and an acidic pH further reduced the rate of bacterial killing, with the maximal bacterial killing occurring 24 h following initial exposure compared with approximately 4–8 h for either mucin or an acidic pH alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that simulating the epithelial lining fluid antagonises amikacin-mediated killing of P. aeruginosa, even at the high concentrations achieved following nebulised administration.

Acari is one of the most abundant clades of Arachnida, exhibiting diverse dietary types, while the underlying genetic adaptive mechanisms are not fully understood. Based on comparative analyses of 15 Acari genomes, we found genetic bases for three specialized diets. Herbivores experienced stronger selection pressure than other groups; the olfactory genes and gene families involving metabolizing toxins showed strong adaptive signals. Genes and gene families related to anticoagulation, detoxification, and haemoglobin digestion were found to be under strong selection pressure or significantly expanded in the blood-feeding species. Lipid metabolism genes have a faster evolutionary rate and been subjected to greater selection pressures in fat-feeding species; one positively selected site in the fatty-acid amide hydrolases 2 gene was identified.

Virus rejection was investigated by PVDF and PP membrane modules, with the pore sizes of 0.22 and 0.1 μm, respectively. In tap water system, 2.1 lg rejection of coliphage T4 could be achieved by PVDF membrane compared with complete rejection by PP membrane, while for coliphage f2 with smaller diameter, 0.3–0.5 lg rejection of the influent virus was removed by the two membranes. In domestic wastewater system, cake layer and gel layer on the membrane surface changed the cut-off size of the membrane so that there was no significant difference between PP and PVDF for each coliphage. The removal ratios of coliphage T4 and f2 in the MBR were more than 5.5 and 3.0 lg, respectively. Compared with 5.5 lg removal for virus T4 in the MBR system, only 2.1 lg (96.8%–99.9%) removal rate was observed in the conventional activated sludge system with the influent virus concentration fluctuating from 1830 to 57000 PFU/mL. Only 0.8%–22% virus removal was the effect of adsorption to activated sludge, which showed a decreasing tendency with the retention time, while 75%–98% was the effect of virus inactivation by microbial activity. It indicated that the major mechanism of virus removal was not the transfer of viruses from the water phase to the sludge phase but inactivation in the biological treatment process.","Zheng, Xiang; Liu, JunXin",Sci China B Chem,489,12

Herein, we present estimates of cancer risk factors and screening tests in 2018 and 2019 among US adults, with a focus on smoking cessation. Cigarette smoking reached a historic low in 2019 (14.2%) partly because 61.7% (54.9 million) of all persons who had ever smoked had quit. Yet, the quit ratio was <45% among lower-income, uninsured, and Medicaid-insured persons, and was <55% among Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, lower-educated, lesbian, gay or bisexual, and recent immigrant persons, and in 12 of 17 Southern states. Obesity levels remain high (2017-2018: 42.4%) and were disproportionately higher among Black (56.9%) and Hispanic (43.7%) women. HPV vaccination in adolescents 13 to 17 years remains underutilized and over 40% were not up-to-date in 2019.

HMPV is difficult to cultivate and limited published data describe the in vitro growth characteristics of the virus and its ability to replicate in different cell lines. Stability of HMPV to different temperatures or environmental conditions has not been described. Nosocomial infections due to HMPV have been reported, and thus the survival of infectious particles on environmental surfaces is important. We tested multiple cell lines for the ability to support HMPV replication both in the presence and absence of exogenous trypsin. The most permissive monkey kidney epithelial cells were LLC-MK2 and Vero, while the most permissive human airway epithelial cell line was BEAS-2B. LLC-MK2 cells were tolerant of trypsin and thus remain an ideal cell line for HMPV cultivation. Spinoculation significantly increased the infectivity of HMPV for cells in monolayer culture. Infectious virus was very stable to repeat freeze-thaw cycles, ambient room temperature, or 4 degrees C, while incubation at 37 degrees C led to degradation of virus titer. Finally, nonporous materials such as metal or plastic retained infectious virus for prolonged periods, while virus deposited on tissue and fabric rapidly lost infectivity. These findings provide guidance for laboratories attempting to culture HMPV and relevant information for infection control policies.","Tollefson, Sharon J; Cox, Reagan G; Williams, John V",Virus research,489,0

Through an interactive approach, we co-designed a bespoke in-person and virtual GC model, where patients are reviewed in a group setting. Improvements were made following each session following patient input and team reflections. Outcomes measured included patient satisfaction, self-perceived health literacy, and successful implementation of the GCs.

While the risks of OCS are well known, the benefit remains unclear due the absence of a standardized prescribing regimen. Consequently, it is difficult to characterize whether the risks of OCS and its ability to avert endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) are helpful in AMT. When OCS is highly effective at averting surgery, the lesser risks of OCS would be justified because it can avoid the greater risks of ESS. When OCS is poorly effective at averting ESS, the risks of OCS would not be justified because many patients will be exposed to both risks. This study seeks to identify the threshold effectiveness of OCS at averting ESS that would minimize risk exposure to patients. METHODS A probabilistic risks-based decision analysis was constructed from literature reported incidences and impacts of adverse events of OCS and ESS. Monte Carlo analysis was performed to identify the minimum effectiveness required to avoid further intervention (MERAFI) for chronic sinusitis without nasal polyp (CRSsNP) and chronic sinusitis with nasal polyp (CRSwNP). RESULTS The analysis showed MERAFI results of 20.8% (95% CI 20.7-20.9%) for CRSsNP and 16.8% (95% CI 16.7-16.9%) for CRSwNP. CONCLUSIONS Given reported OCS effectiveness in the range of 34-71% in CRSsNP and 46-63% in CRSwNP, this analysis suggests that the inclusion of OCS in AMT may be the lower risk strategy.

Patients infected with SARS-CoV2 virus but with negative test results will appear in general hospitals and may pose a risk to other patients and hospital staff. Health care workers constitutes nearly 17% of infected population in Poland, therefore early identification of infected people becomes a priority to protect human resources and to ensure continuity of the access to a surgical care. Both surgical operations, and endoscopic procedures are considered as interventions with an increased risk of infection. Therefore, determining the algorithm becomes crucial for qualifying patients for surgical treatment, but also to stratify the risk of personnel being infected during surgery and to adequately protect staff.

METHODS Some 910 patients had colorectal resections for cancer between 2006 and 2013, and 134 of them were operated on using SILS. Eighty of these SILS patients were compared to a cohort of patients who had open surgery that were matching in tumour stage and location, type of resection, sex, age and ASA Score.

The rate of operations performed by surgical residents was equivalent in both groups (44/80 (SILS) vs. 46/80 (OS), p = 0.75). CONCLUSION The data demonstrates that SILS results in similar long-term oncological outcomes when compared to open surgery as well as morbidity rates. The hospital stay in the SILS group was shorter. SILS can also be incorporated in surgical training programmes.","Rink, Andreas D; Golubev, Vitaly; Vestweber, Boris; Paul, Claudia; Lang, Hauke; Vestweber, Karl-Heinz",International journal of colorectal disease,489,1

The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize evidence regarding data and information visualizations integrated into consumer health informatics solutions for chronic disease management in the community. A search was conducted in CINAHL, EMBASE, Engineering Village, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science between January 1, 2007, and May 1, 2019. Studies were evaluated using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Of the 2549 published studies, six studies met inclusion criteria. Of these six studies, two used information visualizations, two used data visualizations, and two used both information and data visualizations. Graphs were the main type of visualization used. Visualizations were mainly delivered in mobile applications and were interactive. The goals of the visualizations varied across studies including to (1) improve understanding of health data, (2) improve patient-provider communication, (3) monitor chronic disease, and/or (4) improve chronic disease management. Five studies reported subjective outcomes of the visualizations (eg, perceived usability, acceptability). One study reported both subjective and objective outcomes (eg, recall) of the visualizations. Findings highlight the need for more research on data and information visualizations integrated into consumer health technologies that support chronic disease management in daily life.","Lor, Maichou; Backonja, Uba","Computers, informatics, nursing : CIN",489,1

Materials and Methods Pure tone audiometry (PTA) was performed at 0.25-12 kHz on 35 RT and 25 CRT patients after 12-month followed up. The hearing loss was evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria. Results SNHL increased to 84% in patients who had received CRT, compared with 26% increasing in patients who had treated with RT. There was an increased risk of SNHL at all frequencies for ears received a cochlear mean dose >50 Gy in RT group, compared to those receiving cochlear mean dose >30 Gy in CRT group. SNHL was more severe at higher frequencies in both patient groups. Conclusion Characteristic of radiation-induced SNHL is different from CRT-induced SNHL, especially in threshold radiation dose and PTA frequency.","Mahdavi, Seied Rabi; Rezaeyan, Abolhasan; Nikoofar, Alireza; Bakhshandeh, Mohsen; Farahani, Saeid; Cheraghi, Susan",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,489,1

METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, charts of 52 eyes of 26 consecutive infants were reviewed. The patients received 0.0125 mL (Group 1) or 0.025 mL (Group 2) anti-VEGF agents' intravitreally. The IOP was measured before injection, on the first day, during the first week, and in the first month. After each injection, optic nerve head perfusion was evaluated by a binocular indirect ophthalmoscope. IOP values, complications, use of antiglaucomatous drops, and the effects of anti-VEGF drugs were recorded. RESULTS The mean baseline IOP before injection was 16.0 ± 3.7 mmHg for Group 1 and 15.5 ± 4.5 mmHg for Group 2 (p = 0.365). The mean value of IOP on the first day was statistically increased in Group 2 (29.2 ± 6.1 mmHg) compared with Group 1 (24.1 ± 6.8 mmHg) (p = 0.013). Moreover, antiglaucomatous drops were needed in 12 eyes for Group 2 compared with seven eyes for Group 1. Anterior chamber paracentesis was not performed after any of the injections. CONCLUSION This study found that IOP increases after intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of ROP. The injection of 0.025 mL anti-VEGF agents increases IOP more than the 0.0125 mL injection in the treatment of infants with aggressive posterior ROP.","Ozdemir, Ozdemir; Arman, Aysegul; Tayman, Cuneyt",Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,489,17

In recent years, several initiatives have targeted the reduction or elimination of low-value practices in healthcare. Research suggests that passive interventions, such as the publication of guidelines, are often not sufficient to change behaviour and that active change interventions - interventions which actively implement strategies to change practices - are required to effect significant, sustained practice change. The purpose of this scoping review is to identify and characterise studies of active change interventions designed to reduce or eliminate low-value healthcare practices. METHODS We will conduct a review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Scopus databases from inception. Building on previous research, 40 key terms will be used to search literature. The screening process will be conducted separately by two researchers, with discrepancies resolved by a third. Empirical studies of active change interventions used to reduce or eliminate low-value practices will be included. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis will be used to categorise the characteristics of the studies. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is not required for this study. This scoping review will provide insights into the impact of several characteristics of active change interventions, including the number of interventions (single-faceted or multifaceted) and the level of implementation (individual or organisational). These results can provide guidance and direction for future research in de-implementation. The results will be disseminated through presentations at national and international conferences and the publication of a manuscript.","Parker, Gillian; Rappon, Tim; Berta, Whitney",BMJ open,489,33

It is carried out in a variety of clinical settings in hospitals and primary care, and its use is standard practice among high-risk, critically ill patients, and those who have undergone cardiac surgery. ECG recording is classified into two main categories: monitoring and diagnostic. 12-lead ECGs, which require electrodes to be placed on the chest and each limb, are used for diagnostic purposes, whereas 3- or 5-lead ECGs are used for rhythm monitoring. Cross-infection can arise from reusing ECG cables, even if they have been cleaned. Surgical site infection is a particular risk in patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting, because ECG wires are placed on the chest close to the incision site. Single-use ECG leads, such as the Kendall DL™ ECG cable and lead wire system, reduce the risk of cross-contamination between patients and free nursing time for patient care because they are discarded after use and do not have to be cleaned and disinfected for use with another patient.","Bloe, Charlie",British journal of nursing,489,28

Two were infected with a wild-type virus derived from a full-length infectious clone (A12-IC), and two were infected with a clone-derived virus lacking the leader gene (A12-LLV2), with euthanasia and tissue collection at 24 and 72 h postexposure (hpe). Clinical disease was apparent only in the animal given A12-IC and euthanized at 72 hpe. In situ hybridization revealed that the animal infected with A12-IC and euthanized at 24 hpe had abundant viral nucleic acid in the lung, present in clusters of positive cells in the respiratory bronchiolar epithelium and associated subepithelial regions. At 72 hpe in the A12-IC-infected calf, viral nucleic acid in the lung was present in interstitial areas, and in addition, viral nucleic acid was detectable in epithelial tissues around histologically apparent vesicles. In animals infected with A12-LLV2, viral nucleic acid was detectable in the lung at both 24 and 72 hpe, but staining revealed a more localized distribution with less nucleic acid than was found in animals given A12-IC. Therefore, it appears that after aerosol exposure to A12-IC, early replication is in the region of the lung, with subsequent dissemination to distal sites. In comparison, the A12-LLV2 virus is much less widely disseminated in the lung at 24 hpe, with no lesions or virus detectable in secondary sites at 72 hpe. The greatly reduced pathogenicity of A12-LLV2 may make it an excellent candidate for a modified live viral vaccine.","Brown, C C; Piccone, M E; Mason, P W; McKenna, T S; Grubman, M J",Journal of virology,489,12

We elect to perform bypass because patients can have greater long-term survival with chemoradiation following this operation. We sought to compare complications in cases of bypass without thoracotomy versus those with thoracotomy. Thirty-four locally advanced esophageal cancer patients between 2007 and 2014 were studied. Eighteen patients underwent thoracotomy, and 16 patients did not have a thoracotomy. CT was obtained to check the anastomosis and the oral stump of the esophagus and to measure the diameter of the intrathoracic esophagus. In the thoracotomy group, the rate of postoperative pulmonary complications was high. On the other hand, in the non-thoracotomy group, the rates of anastomotic leak and recurrent nerve paralysis were high. The stump of the esophagus was 2 cm lower in the T group than in the nT group. As the esophagus shortens after division, the final difference in esophageal height between the groups was only around 1 cm. We concluded that a viable gastric tube with a good blood supply as well as a careful cervical operation are the most important aspects of the esophageal bypass operation.","Kimura, Masahiro",The Indian journal of surgery,489,5

This fact is supported by the concept of beneficial non specific effect of this live vaccine associated to its interaction with the immune system. Our study aims to identify the correlation between the universal BCG vaccination policy and the mortality attributed to COVID-19. Methods : We conducted an epidemiological study in which we collected COVID-19 pandemic data of April 11th, 2020 from the web site worldometers.info . The exclusion criteria for our study were a number of inhabitants less than one million, low-income countries according to the World Bank classification, a total number of infection cases less than 500 and countries that have performed less than one hundred tests per million inhabitants. Results : Countries that never had universal BCG vaccination policy have a higher mortality (correlated to performed diagnostic tests) attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection (p<0.001). We found that the year of introduction of vaccination influenced significantly the mortality. Countries that started immunization policy before 1960 had more favorable results (p=0.049). For countries that started the BCG vaccination after 1960, countries with current policies have lower mortality attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection than countries that have stopped immunization (p=0.047). Conclusions : Countries that have a BCG vaccination policy have a lower mortality attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The populations of countries that applied this immunization before 1960 are more protected even if this universal policy has been interrupted.","Ouanes, Y.; Bibi, M.; Baradai, N.; Boukhris, M.; Chaker, K.; Kacem, A.; Hedhli, H.; Mrad Deli, K.; Sellami, A.; Ben Rhouma, S.; Nouira, Y.",,489,20

Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared by trimester of infection and disease severity at the time of delivery. Results The principal study findings were: 1) among 240 pregnant patients in Washington State with SARS-CoV-2 infections, 1 in 11 developed severe or critical disease, 1 in 10 were hospitalized for COVID-19, and 1 in 80 died; 2) the COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate was 3.5-fold higher than in similarly-aged adults in Washington State [10.0% vs. 2.8%; rate ratio (RR) 3.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-5.3]; 3) pregnant patients hospitalized for a respiratory concern were more likely to have a comorbidity or underlying conditions including asthma, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease, and Class III obesity; 4) three maternal deaths (1.3%) were attributed to COVID-19 for a maternal mortality rate of 1,250/100,000 pregnancies (95%CI 257-3,653); 5) the COVID-19 case fatality in pregnancy was a significant 13.6-fold (95%CI 2.7-43.6) higher in pregnant patients compared to similarly aged individuals in Washington State with an absolute difference in mortality rate of 1.2% (95%CI -0.3-2.6); and 6) preterm birth was significantly higher among women with severe/critical COVID-19 at delivery than for women who had recovered from COVID-19 (45.4% severe/critical COVID-19 vs. 5.2% mild COVID-19, p<0.001). Conclusions COVID-19 hospitalization and case fatality rates in pregnant patients were significantly higher compared to similarly aged adults in Washington State. This data indicates that pregnant patients are at risk for severe or critical disease and mortality compared to non-pregnant adults, as well as preterm birth.","Lokken, Erica M.; Huebner, Emily M.; Taylor, G.
