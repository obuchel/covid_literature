15985,15985,15985,ELF3 activated by a superenhancer and an autoregulatory feedback loop is required for high-level HLA-C expression on extravillous trophoblasts,7.0334997,7.9578276,2021-03-02,"A hallmark of aging is loss of differentiated cell identity. Aged Drosophila midgut differentiated enterocytes (ECs) lose their identity, impairing tissue homeostasis. To discover identity regulators, we performed an RNAi screen targeting ubiquitin-related genes in ECs. Seventeen genes were identified, including the deubiquitinase Non-stop (CG4166). Lineage tracing established that acute loss of Non-stop in young ECs phenocopies aged ECs at cellular and tissue levels. Proteomic analysis unveiled that Non-stop maintains identity as part of a Non-stop identity complex (NIC) containing E(y)2, Sgf11, Cp190, (Mod) mdg4, and Nup98. Non-stop ensured chromatin accessibility, maintaining the EC-gene signature, and protected NIC subunit stability. Upon aging, the levels of Non-stop and NIC subunits declined, distorting the unique organization of the EC nucleus. Maintaining youthful levels of Non-stop in wildtype aged ECs safeguards NIC subunits, nuclear organization, and suppressed aging phenotypes. Thus, Non-stop and NIC, supervise EC identity and protects from premature aging.","Erez, Neta; Israitel, Lena; Bitman-Lotan, Eliya; Wong, Wing H; Raz, Gal; Cornelio-Parra, Dayanne V; Danial, Salwa; Flint Brodsly, Na'ama; Belova, Elena; Maksimenko, Oksana; Georgiev, Pavel; Druley, Todd; Mohan, Ryan D; Orian, Amir",,675,1

In the present study, the anticholinesterase effects of eight selected Bangladeshi medicinal plant species were investigated. Species were selected based on the traditional uses against CNS-related diseases. Extracts were prepared using a gentle cold extraction method. In vitro cholinesterase inhibitory effects were measured by Ellman's method in 96-well microplates. Blumea lacera (Compositae) and Cyclea barbata (Menispermaceae) were found to have the highest acetylcholinesterase inhibitory (IC(50,) 150 ± 11 and 176 ± 14 µg/mL, respectively) and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory effect (IC(50), 297 ± 13 and 124 ± 2 µg/mL, respectively). Cyclea barbata demonstrated competitive inhibition, where Blumea lacera showed an uncompetitive inhibition mode for acetylcholinesterase. Smilax guianensis (Smilacaceae) and Byttneria pilosa (Malvaceae) were also found to show moderate AChE inhibition (IC(50,) 205 ± 31 and 221 ± 2 µg/mL, respectively), although no significant BChE inhibitory effect was observed for extracts from these plant species. Among others, Thunbergia grandiflora (Acanthaceae) and Mikania micrantha (Compositae) were found to display noticeable AChE (IC(50), 252 ± 22 µg/mL) and BChE (IC(50), 314 ± 15 µg/mL) inhibitory effects, respectively. Molecular docking experiment suggested that compounds 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,3′,4′-pentamethoxyflavone (BL4) and kaempferol-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1⟶6)-β-D-glucopyranoside (BL5) from Blumea lacera bound stably to the binding groove of the AChE and BChE by hydrogen-bond interactions, respectively. Therefore, these compounds could be candidates for cholinesterase inhibitors. The present findings demonstrated that Blumea lacera and Cyclea barbata are interesting objects for further studies aiming at future therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.","Uddin, Md Josim; Russo, Daniela; Rahman, Md Mahbubur; Uddin, Shaikh Bokhtear; Halim, Mohammad A.; Zidorn, Christian; Milella, Luigi",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,675,1

Although preventing these infections by using vaccines has been the most successful strategy to date, effective vaccines are not always available. Therefore, developing broad-spectrum anti-viral drugs to treat such infections is essential, especially in the case of immunocompromised patients, or for outbreaks of novel virus strains. Sialic acids have been highlighted as a key molecule in the viral infection cycle, with terminally sialylated glycans acting as a target for several viral proteins involved in infection, particularly respiratory infection. Inhibitors of one such protein, neuraminidase, are the only anti-influenza drugs currently on the market. Problems with neuraminidase inhibitors, including development of resistance and a relatively narrow spectrum of activity, drive the need for an improved understanding of the viral infection cycle and the development of more resilient, broader-spectrum anti-viral treatments. Hence, this review outlines the various roles played by sialic acids in respiratory viral infection and provides examples of drugs that exploit sialic acids to inhibit viral infections. It has been concluded that drugs targeting host cell expression of sialic acid could be especially well suited to inhibiting a broad spectrum of respiratory infections. This warrants the continued design and improvement of such drugs in an attempt to lessen the burden of respiratory infections.","Steele, Harrison; Tague, Andrew J; Skropeta, Danielle",Current medicinal chemistry,675,16

CCI is mediated by cerebral microangiopathy, which develops due to vascular remodeling, increased arterial stiffness, endothelial dysfunction, impaired cerebrovascular reactivity, and neuroinflammation. All those mechanisms lead to white matter lesions and cognitive impairment. Arteriolosclerosis is the primary morphological process that damages perforating arteries and arterioles. COVID-19 pandemic can modify CCI progression due to similar pathophysiology. In particular, COVID-19-Associated coagulopathy can lead to silent lacunar infarctions and lacunar stroke development. Treatment features of patients with CCI during the COVID-19 pandemic are reviewed. It is concluded that special attention in this group of patients should be paid to primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention issues, an essential element of which is the use of dipyridamole since it has a pleiotropic effect. © 2021 Ima-Press Publishing House.

It is the total of anatomical, physiological, and psychological domains of an individual. The diseases often manifest by susceptibility that depends upon Prakriti of individuals. COVID 19 is a new disease, where the status of the susceptibility of its victim in terms of Prakriti is not known. This study has been undertaken to determine the Prakriti of COVID 19 positive patients. Method The validated instrument CCRAS Prakriti assessment scale has been applied to the COVID 19 positive patients admitted between 16 May 2020 to 10 June 2020 at COVID hospital. Result Data of 117 patients aged 10 to 80 years have been analyzed. The ratio of male-female patients was 1.8:1.

In this study, the frequency, and clinical course of COVID-19 infection in patients with Celiac disease (CD) were investigated. CD patients' adherence to purchasing gluten free products (GFPs), the strict diet, and how patients' anxiety affects CD symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak were also examined. Patients and methods A detailed questionnaire was administered by telephone and emailed to the CD patients to determine the status of these patients in obtaining GFPs, and dietary compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic. State and trait anxiety levels of patients were evaluated using the State-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scale. Additionally, whether patients with CD were diagnosed with COVID-19, and if diagnosed, their clinical course of the disease were investigated. Results One hundred and one patients were included in the study. The total number of patients who could obtain GFPs decreased significantly in the pandemic than before the pandemic. The patients' state anxiety index was 40.7±7.9, and the trait anxiety index was 44.5±8.5, and all patients were evaluated as mildly anxious. During the pandemic, two female patients were diagnosed with COVID-19.

An epidemic of feline infectious peritonitis and concern for spread of infectious disease resulted in decreased movement of cheetahs between U.S. zoological facilities for managed captive breeding. Identifying the true feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection status of cheetahs is challenging because of inconsistent correlation between seropositivity and fecal viral shedding. Because the pattern of fecal shedding of FCoV is unknown in cheetahs, this study aimed to assess the frequency of detectable fecal viral shedding in a 30-day period and to determine the most efficient fecal sampling strategy to identify cheetahs shedding FCoV. Fecal samples were collected from 16 cheetahs housed at seven zoological facilities for 30 to 46 consecutive days; the samples were evaluated for the presence of FCoV by reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR). Forty-four percent (7/16) of cheetahs had detectable FCoV in feces, and the proportion of positive samples for individual animals ranged from 13 to 93%. Cheetahs shed virus persistently, intermittently, or rarely over 30-46 days. Fecal RT-nPCR results were used to calculate the probability of correctly identifying a cheetah known to shed virus given multiple hypothetical fecal collection schedules. The most efficient hypothetical fecal sample collection schedule was evaluation of five individual consecutive fecal samples, resulting in a 90% probability of identifying a known shedder. Demographic and management risk factors were not significantly associated (P < or = 0.05) with fecal viral shedding. Because some cheetahs shed virus intermittently to rarely, fecal sampling schedules meant to identify all known shedders would be impractical with current tests and eradication of virus from the population unreasonable. Managing the captive population as endemically infected with FCoV may be a more feasible approach.","Gaffney, Patricia M; Kennedy, Melissa; Terio, Karen; Gardner, Ian; Lothamer, Chad; Coleman, Kathleen; Munson, Linda",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,675,16

Turner,7.2166033,7.7840137,2020,"BACKGROUND: Loneliness is a public health problem that is expected to rise during the COVID-19 pandemic, given the widespread policy of quarantine. The literature is unclear whether loneliness during COVID-19 is similar to those of non-pandemic seasons. This study examined the expression of loneliness on Twitter during COVID-19 pandemic, and identified key areas of loneliness across diverse communities. METHODS: Twitter was searched for feeds that were:(1) in English; (2) posted from May 1, 2020 to July 1, 2020; (3) posted by individual users (not organisations); and (4) contained the words 'loneliness' and 'COVID-19'. A machine-learning approach (Topic Modeling) identified key topics from the Twitter feeds; Hierarchical Modeling identified overarching themes. Variations in the prevalence of the themes were examined over time and across the number of followers of the Twitter users. RESULTS: 4492 Twitter feeds were included and classified into 3 themes: (1) Community impact of loneliness during COVID-19; (2) Social distancing during COVID-19 and its effects on loneliness; and (3) Mental health effects of loneliness during COVID-19. The 3 themes demonstrated temporal variations. Particularly in Europe, Theme 1 showed a drastic reduction over time, with a corresponding rise in Theme 3. The themes also varied across number of followers. Highly influential users were more likely to talk about Theme 3 and less about Theme 2. CONCLUSIONS: The findings reflect close-to-real-time public sentiments on loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrated the potential usefulness of social media to keep tabs on evolving mental health issues. It also provides inspiration for potential interventions to address novel problems-such as loneliness-during COVID-19 pandemic.","Koh, Jing Xuan; Liew, Tau Ming",J. psychiatr. res,675,20

Healthcare delivery lessons from the pandemic,7.1787863,7.796398,2020,"BACKGROUND: Early studies have reported various electrolyte abnormalities at admission in patients who progress to the severe form of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As electrolyte imbalance may not only impact patient care, but provide insight into the pathophysiology of COVID-19, we aimed to analyse all early data reported on electrolytes in COVID-19 patients with and without severe form. METHODS: An electronic search of Medline (PubMed interface), Scopus and Web of Science was performed for articles comparing electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride and calcium) between COVID-19 patients with and without severe disease. A pooled analysis was performed to estimate the weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Five studies with a total sample size of 1415 COVID-19 patients. Sodium was significantly lower in patients with severe COVID-19 (WMD: -0.91 mmol/L [95% CI: -1.33 to -0.50 mmol/L]). Similarly, potassium was also significantly lower in COVID-19 patients with severe disease (WMD: -0.12 mmol/L [95% CI: -0.18 to -0.07 mmol/L], I2=33%). For chloride, no statistical differences were observed between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 (WMD: 0.30 mmol/L [95% CI: -0.41 to 1.01 mmol/L]). For calcium, a statistically significant lower concentration was noted in patients with severe COVID-19 (WMD: -0.20 mmol/L [95% CI: -0.25 to -0.20 mmol/L]). CONCLUSIONS: This pooled analysis confirms that COVID-19 severity is associated with lower serum concentrations of sodium, potassium and calcium. We recommend electrolytes be measured at initial presentation and serially monitored during hospitalization in order to establish timely and appropriate corrective actions.","Lippi, Giuseppe; South, Andrew M; Henry, Brandon Michael",Ann Clin Biochem,675,28

This study tracked the daily dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Honolulu during a rapidly expanding COVID-19 outbreak and a responding four-week lockdown that resulted in a rapid decrease of daily clinical COVID-19 new cases. The wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration from both WWTPs, as measured by three quantification assays (N1, N2, and E), exhibited both significant inter-day fluctuations (101.2-105.1 gene copies or GC/L in wastewater liquid fractions, or 101.4-106.2 GC/g in solid fractions) and an overall downward trend over the lockdown period. Strong and significant correlation was observed in measured SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations between the solid and liquid wastewater fractions, with the solid fraction containing majority (82.5%-92.5%) of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA mass and the solid-liquid SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration ratios ranging from 103.6 to 104.3 mL/g. The measured wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration was normalized by three endogenous fecal RNA viruses (F+ RNA coliphages Group II and III, and pepper mild mottle virus) to account for variations that may occur during the multi-step wastewater processing and molecular quantification, and the normalized abundance also exhibited similar daily fluctuations and overall downward trend over the sampling period.","Li, Bo; Di, Doris Yoong Wen; Saingam, Prakit; Jeon, Min Ki; Yan, Tao",Water Res,675,30

Even less is known about the possible differences in the executive functioning of OABD and older adults with unipolar depression (OADEP). METHODS: After excluding acutely ill patients, the executive functioning of OABD was compared to that of OADEP and healthy controls (n = 22, n = 20, n = 22; respectively). Cognitive insight, a sub-domain of executive functioning, was operationalized as the discrepancy between the participants' self-reported cognitive functioning and appraisals that were made by their care partners. To complement the cognitive profiling, the groups were compared in information processing speed, verbal memory, and visual-spatial memory. RESULTS: OABD were impaired in several cognitive domains compared to healthy controls, most prominently in executive functioning and memory. OABD had poorer executive functioning and visual-spatial memory than OADEP. The findings also tentatively point toward intact cognitive insight among OABD, while OADEP seem to have a heightened level of awareness of their cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: OABD have a unique profile of cognitive impairment compared to OADEP. It is characterized by a more severe cognitive impairment, accompanied by relatively intact cognitive insight. The findings may help clarify the cognitive profile of OABD and assist in the development of cognitive rehabilitation programs tailored to their needs. They should, however, be considered preliminary and await further research.","Omer, Elad; Braw, Yoram; Amiaz, Revital; Ravona-Springer, Ramit",Int J Geriatr Psychiatry,675,16

The first involves the growing use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for the profound clinical cytokine storm and severe pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Instead, it is recommended to treat alternatively with their MSC-released exosomes. This is because many reports in the literature and our data have shown that the release of exosomes from the in vivo administered MSC is actually responsible for their beneficial effects. Further, the exosomes are superior, simpler and clinically more convenient compared to their parental MSC. Additionally, in the context of COVID-19, the known tendency of MSC to intravascularly aggregate causing lung dysfunction might synergize with the pneumonia aspects, and the tendency of MSC peripheral vascular micro aggregates might synergize with the vascular clots of the COVID-19 disease process, causing significant central or peripheral vascular insufficiency. The second exosome therapeutic area for severe COVID-19 involves use of convalescent plasma for its content of acquired immune antibodies that must consider the role in this therapy of contained nearly trillions of exosomes. Many of these derive from activated immune modulating cells and likely can function to transfer miRNAs that acting epigenetically to also influence the convalescent plasma recipient response to the virus. There is sufficient evidence, like recovery of patients with antibody deficiencies, to postulate that the antibodies actually have little effect and that immune resistance is principally due to T cell mechanisms. Further, COVID-19 convalescent plasma has remarkably weak beneficial effects if compared to what was expected from many prior studies. This may be due to the dysfunctional immune response to the infection and resulting weak Ab that may be impaired further by antagonistic exosomes in the convalescent plasma. At the least, pre selection of plasma for the best antibodies and relevant exosomes would produce the most optimum therapy for very severely affected COVID-19 patients.","Askenase, Philip W",J Extracell Vesicles,675,1

PTG is the experience of positive change that can result from contending with highly challenging life crises (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996). Studies have documented how characteristics of the individual, their trauma exposure, and how they cope or process the event can influence PTG. However, to our knowledge, none have addressed how the activities in which an individual may engage in following the trauma can influence PTG. Following a mass murder that impacted a university community, this study examined how pretragedy factors, objective exposure, psychosocial factors (e.g., core beliefs, posttraumatic stress symptoms, social support), and the posttragedy activities in which participants engaged may influence PTG. The posttragedy activities assessed were Mental Health Services, Informational Support, Grieving and Remembrance, Taking Action, and Coping Activities. Participants (N = 116; 68.1% female; 40% White, 31.3% Asian/Pacific Islander, 14.8% biracial, and 13.9% Latinx) who were enrolled in a college adjustment study the year prior to the tragedy were recontacted and asked to complete an online survey approximately 5-6 months following the MVI. Hierarchical regression results revealed that core beliefs and the posttragedy activity category of Taking Action were associated with PTG. Findings contribute to our understanding of the influences on PTG for university students impacted by a MVI and highlight the need to further examine the role of posttragedy activities, such as Taking Action on posttragedy adjustment.

The dynamics of these correlations suggest the feasibility of using Google queries to forecast COVID-19 cases and mortality for up to three weeks in advance. Our results and analysis framework set the stage for the development of predictive models for forecasting COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths using historical data and Google search trends for nine symptoms associated with both outcomes.","Abbas, Mostafa; Morland, Thomas B; Hall, Eric S; El-Manzalawy, Yasser",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),675,30

However, due to the different HI correction methods, multiple NGD methods based on the fast neutron, thermal neutron, and capture gamma detection coexist in the well-logging field, and show considerable differences in the tool specifications. To clarify these differences and guide the NGD development, three typical NGD methods using the fast neutron count ratio, thermal neutron count ratio, and capture gamma count ratio (abbreviated as NGD-FC, NGD-TC, and NGD-CC methods) are selected as representatives for comparative study. Using the Monte Carlo simulation, an integrated NGD tool model was established for studying the differences of three NGD methods in the logging responses, data processing methods, and environmental applications. Research shows that, although the three NGD methods have different measurement systems and data processing methods, the three methods can get rid of the HI effect and obtain accurate formation density. The changes of wellbore size and wellbore fluid have similar and significant impact on the three NGD methods and lead to large density errors, especially for the large-size wellbore or wellbore gas conditions. In the different lithology conditions, three methods have good performances, but the NGD-FC and NGD-CC methods have smaller density errors than NGD-TC method. Compared to the other two NGD methods, the NGD-FC method also has a perfect performance in the oil or gas-saturated formation, while NGD-TC and NGD-CC methods have extremely large errors in the gas-saturated formation. Besides, the NGD-FC method are hardly affected by the formation water salinity, the NGD-TC method is slightly affected, while the NGD-CC method is greatly affected. This study can provide a guidance for the tool design, data processing and environment correction of the NGD technology.","Zhang, Quanying; Zhang, Feng; Yuan, Chao; Deng, Rui; Liu, Guobin",Appl Radiat Isot,675,3

PROBLEM: At the time of the arrival of the epidemic in France, there were limited data regarding how COVID-19 could affect children. A lesser severity compared with adults was described, but knowledge concerning clinical forms and screening strategies was missing. METHODOLOGY: In this retrospective and non-interventional epidemiological study, we aimed to describe the epidemiology and the clinical features of COVID-19 pediatric disease in the first university hospital affected by the epidemic in France. We included all underage patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays on nasopharyngeal smears performed between February 25, 2020 and April 30, 2020. RESULTS: The presence of fever and respiratory signs was frequent (>50%), as was the presence of general or digestive signs, but patients were also frequently asymptomatic, making the discovery of a positive smear fortuitous. There were no deaths in our cohort. CONCLUSION: No patient with a serious form of COVID-19 was treated in the pediatrics departments of Strasbourg University Hospital during the first 2 months of the epidemic. Diagnostic strategies have evolved over the course of the epidemic, ranging from exploring relevant symptoms to systematic screening.","Lavaine, O; Spizzo, J; Arbitre, C; Muller, J; Kuhn, P; Laugel, V; Tchomakov, D",Arch. pediatr,675,22

Here, we report that RNA triggers the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, N. By analyzing all 29 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, we find that only N is predicted as an LLPS protein. We further confirm the LLPS of N during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among the 100,849 genome variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the GISAID database, we identify that ~37% (36,941) of the genomes contain a specific trio-nucleotide polymorphism (GGG-to-AAC) in the coding sequence of N, which leads to the amino acid substitutions, R203K/G204R. Interestingly, NR203K/G204R exhibits a higher propensity to undergo LLPS and a greater effect on IFN inhibition. By screening the chemicals known to interfere with N-RNA binding in other viruses, we find that (-)-gallocatechin gallate (GCG), a polyphenol from green tea, disrupts the LLPS of N and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Thus, our study reveals that targeting N-RNA condensation with GCG could be a potential treatment for COVID-19.","Zhao, Ming; Yu, Yu; Sun, Li-Ming; Xing, Jia-Qing; Li, Tingting; Zhu, Yunkai; Wang, Miao; Yu, Yin; Xue, Wen; Xia, Tian; Cai, Hong; Han, Qiu-Ying; Yin, Xiaoyao; Li, Wei-Hua; Li, Ai-Ling; Cui, Jiuwei; Yuan, Zhenghong; Zhang, Rong; Zhou, Tao; Zhang, Xue-Min; Li, Tao",Nat Commun,675,16

There is limited evidence to support its clinical use in COVID-19 patients. We conducted a Pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a single dose of ivermectin reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 when administered early after disease onset. Methods: Consecutive patients with non-severe COVID-19 and no risk factors for complicated disease attending the emergency room of the Clínica Universidad de Navarra between July 31, 2020 and September 11, 2020 were enrolled. All enrollments occurred within 72 h of onset of fever or cough. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive ivermectin, 400 mcg/kg, single dose (n = 12) or placebo (n = 12). The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR from nasopharyngeal swab at day 7 post-treatment. The primary outcome was supported by determination of the viral load and infectivity of each sample. The differences between ivermectin and placebo were calculated using Fisher's exact test and presented as a relative risk ratio. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04390022. Findings: All patients recruited completed the trial (median age, 26 [IQR 19-36 in the ivermectin and 21-44 in the controls] years; 12 [50%] women; 100% had symptoms at recruitment, 70% reported headache, 62% reported fever, 50% reported general malaise and 25% reported cough). At day 7, there was no difference in the proportion of PCR positive patients (RR 0·92, 95% CI: 0·77-1·09, p = 1·0). The ivermectin group had non-statistically significant lower viral loads at day 4 (p = 0·24 for gene E; p = 0·18 for gene N) and day 7 (p = 0·16 for gene E; p = 0·18 for gene N) post treatment as well as lower IgG titers at day 21 post treatment (p = 0·24). Patients in the ivermectin group recovered earlier from hyposmia/anosmia (76 vs 158 patient-days; p < 0.001). Interpretation: Among patients with non-severe COVID-19 and no risk factors for severe disease receiving a single 400 mcg/kg dose of ivermectin within 72 h of fever or cough onset there was no difference in the proportion of PCR positives. There was however a marked reduction of self-reported anosmia/hyposmia, a reduction of cough and a tendency to lower viral loads and lower IgG titers which warrants assessment in larger trials.

Les questions ciblaient plusieurs thèmes tels que le contexte de vie, le vécu émotionnel et les répercussions sur les habitudes quotidiennes chez les enfants et adolescents, tels que perçus par les parents. Résultats : Au total, 439 parents ont répondu au questionnaire. Les familles sont globalement restées dans leur lieu de vie habituel et ont réussi à bien s’adapter. En moyenne, le niveau d’inquiétude des enfants (estimé par les parents) était moins élevé que celui que les parents s’attribuent. L’état psychologique des enfants et adolescents était globalement stable mais pour ceux qui ont vécu davantage d’émotions négatives que d’habitude, il s’agissait d’une augmentation de l’ennui, de l’irritabilité et de la colère.

Disinfection reduces the risk posed by waterborne pathogens;however, it threatens ecological safety. Comprising residual disinfectants, disinfection byproducts (DBPs), and other contaminants, disinfected wastewater effluents have a negative impact on aquatic organisms as well as on the balance of the aquatic ecosystem of the recipient water body. Here, we reviewed the in vivo toxicity bioassays of disinfected wastewater effluents on the aquatic organisms at different trophic levels, including freshwater organisms and marine organisms. Associated variables, i.e., total suspended solids (TSSs), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), residual disinfectants, and features of the effluent (water temperature and sampling season), can significantly influence the results of these in vivo toxicity bioassays. Each typical test organism has its own pros and cons, where the species type, life stages, and test endpoints have crucial influences on the bioassays;therefore, they should be taken into account before and during the studies on ecotoxicological effects. More efforts should be expended toward conducting more practical bioassays involving the scenarios of the recipient water body in order to better simulate real ecotoxicological effects of disinfected wastewater effluents;extended exposure time should be considered to gain additional insights into the long-term or pass-generation ecotoxicological effects, approaching true levels in the recipient water body.","Luan, XinMiao Liu XiaoYu Fang Chao Chu WenHai Xu ZuXin",Environmental Science: Water Research &amp; Technology,675,16

Distrust in government and a lessened authority of science to determine facts have both been exacerbated by the polarization and disinformation enhanced by social media. These have impaired society's willingness to comply with and persevere with social distancing, which has been the most powerful initial response to mitigate the pandemic. These preexisting weaknesses also threaten the future acceptance of vaccination and contact tracing, two other tools needed to combat epidemics. Medical ethicists might best help in this situation by promoting truth-telling, encouraging the rational adjudication of facts, providing transparent decision-making and advocating the virtue of cooperation to maximize the common good. Those interventions should be aimed at the social level. The same elements of emphasizing cooperation and beneficence also apply to the design of triage protocols for when resources are overwhelmed.

Methods: We conduct data-driven and model-free estimations for the growth rates of the COVID-19 epidemics in Italy and Canada, by fitting an exponential curve to the daily reported cases. We use these estimates to predict epidemic trends in Canada under different scenarios of public health interventions. Results: In Italy, the initial growth rate (0.22) has reduced to 0.1 two weeks after the lockdown of the country on March 8th ,2020. This corresponds to an increase of the doubling time from about 3.15 to almost 7 days. In comparison, the growth rate in Canada has increased from 0.13 between March 1st and 13th, to 0.25 between March 13th to 22nd. This current growth rate corresponds to a doubling time of 2.7 days, and therefore, unless further public health interventions are escalated in Canada, we project 15,000 cases by March 31st. However, the case number may be reduced to 4000 if escalated public health interventions could instantly reduce the growth rate to 0.1, the same level achieved in Italy. Interpretation: Prompt and farsighted interventions are critical to counteract the very rapid initial growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada. Mitigation plans must take into account the delayed effect of interventions by up to 2-weeks and the short doubling time of 3–4 days.","Scarabel, Francesca; Pellis, Lorenzo; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Wu, Jianhong",Infect.

Recently, humanity has faced deadly viral infections, including Zika, Ebola and the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The threat is associated with the ability of the viruses to mutate frequently and adapt to different hosts. Thus, there is the need for robust detection and classification of emerging virus strains to ensure that humanity is prepared in terms of vaccine and drug developments. A point or stand-off biosensor that can detect and classify viruses from indoor and outdoor environments would be suited for viral surveillance. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a facile and versatile tool that has been explored for stand-off detection in different environments including atmospheric, oceans and forest sensing. Notably, laser-induced fluorescence-light detection and ranging (LIF-LiDAR) has been used to identify MS2 bacteriophage on artificially contaminated surgical equipment or released amidst other primary biological aerosol particles in laboratory-like close chamber. It has also been shown to distinguish between different picornaviruses. Currently, the potentials of the LIF-LiDAR technology for real-time stand-off surveillance of pathogenic viruses in indoor and outdoor environments have not been assessed. Considering the increasing applications of LIF-LiDAR for potential microbial pathogens detection and classification, and the need for more robust tools for viral surveillance at safe distance, we critically evaluate the prospects and challenges of LIF-LiDAR technology for real-time stand-off detection and classification of potentially pathogenic viruses in various environments.","Owoicho, Oloche; Olwal, Charles Ochieng039; Quaye, Osbourne",Microb. biotechnol.

By appealing to people's sense of collective effort (dugnadsånd) Norwegian leaders successfully managed to coordinate the actions of the population and beat the outbreak. Design/methodology/approach: The argument builds on the pragmatic sociology associated with Boltanski and Thévenot and their “orders of worth”. Building on qualitative interview studies of the Norwegian middle and working classes a moral ideal type labelled “the socially responsible citizen” is identified. Findings: The authors argue that dugnad is embedded in a moral repertoire of the socially responsible citizen that is indicative of a specific Norwegian welfare mentality and that is imperative for the sustainability and resilience of the Norwegian welfare model. This repertoire is found across social classes and has to be understood in light of the Norwegian welfare model and the role of civil society. Social implications: The analysis explains the societal impact of the appeal and endorsement of the notion of dugnad in the context of the outbreak of COVID-19.

This paper aims to investigate the potential for consumers’ continued usage of an E-wallet service through an integrated framework based on two established models: the Health Belief Model (HBM) and Technology Continuous Theory (TCT). An electronic survey was distributed to a sample of 1080 individuals from academic society in three different Hungarian universities who had used an electronic wallet during the pandemic COVID-19. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied in the study and explained the 55.9% variance in consumers’ continuous intention towards E-wallet usage. This study found that while the COVID-19 pandemic strongly influenced the current use of e-wallets;the pivotal factor affecting their continued use is based on consumer self-efficacy. The study has both short and long-term implications;in the short-term, decisionmakers should utilize health threat constructs (as an element of the protective behaviors taken during the COVID-19 pandemic) to motivate consumers to use E-wallets;in the longer-term, banks should develop further strategies that encourage consumer loyalty regarding E-wallets by reassuring customers that these financial services achieve the value and benefits that they expect, resulting in self-efficacy.","Daragmeh, Ahmad Sági Judit Zéman Zoltán","Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity",675,22

T-cell proliferation is telomere length (TL)-dependent and telomeres shorten with age. Older Covid-19 patients, we hypothesize, are therefore at a higher risk of having TL-dependent lymphopenia. We measured TL by the novel Telomere Shortest Length Assay (TeSLA), and by Southern blotting of the terminal restriction fragments (SB) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 17 Covid-19 and 21 non-Covid-19 patients, aged 87 ± 8 (mean ± SD) and 87 ± 9 years, respectively. TeSLA tallies and measures single telomeres, including short telomeres undetected by SB. Such telomeres are relevant to TL-mediated biological processes, including cell viability and senescence. TeSLA yields two key metrics: the proportion of telomeres with different lengths (expressed in %), and their mean, TeSLA mTL (expressed in kb). Lymphocyte count (10 9/L) was 0.91 ± 0.42 in Covid-19 patients and 1.50 ± 0.50 in non-Covid-19 patients (P < 0.001). In Covid-19 patients, but not in non-Covid-19 patients, lymphocyte count was inversely correlated with the proportion of telomeres shorter than 2 kb (P = 0.005) and positively correlated with TeSLA mTL (P = 0.03). Lymphocyte count was not significantly correlated with SB mTL in either Covid-19 or non-Covid-19 patients. We propose that compromised TL-dependent T-cell proliferative response, driven by short telomere in the TL distribution, contributes to Covid-19 lymphopenia among old adults.

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on all pediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19. RP was defined as the positive result of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after symptom resolution and discharge. Children were defined as being less than 18 years old. RESULTS: Fourteen out of 38 (36.8%) pediatric patients exhibited RP. Compared with the non-RP group (n = 24), the RP group (n = 14) had more family cluster infections, relatively higher white blood cell (WBC) count and longer plasma prothrombin time (PT), while age and gender were insignificant. T lymphocyte subclassification was observed at five-time points: the first test after admission, 2 weeks, and 1, 2, and 3 months after discharge. The RP group had a higher percentage and count of CD8+ T lymphocytes and lower CD4+/CD8+ ratio at 2 weeks, while a lower percentage and count of CD4+ T lymphocytes and lower CD4+/CD8+ ratio at 2 months. The positive rate of nasopharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR was higher during the onset, while that of anal swabs was higher during the recovery of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Family cluster infection, higher WBC count, and longer PT are the early risk factors for RP in recovered COVID-19 children. The dynamic changes in number and ratio of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes may be involved in prolonged SARS-CoV-2 clearance. Nasopharyngeal swabs sampling during the onset and anal swabs sampling during the recovery may improve the positivity rate of RT-PCR.","Peng, Denggao; Zhang, Jing; Ji, Yiling; Pan, Dongming",Pediatr Pulmonol,675,20

This effort examines the use of multicookers to apply moist heat, as they are available in retail stores and more affordable than methods requiring more sophisticated equipment. Four of five multicooker models examined met the acceptance criteria for the test and one model was selected for inactivation testing. Tests were performed on four different FFR models with SARS-CoV-2 suspended in culture media, simulated saliva or simulated lung fluid. Moist heat treatment reduced recoverable titres of SARS-CoV-2 virus to levels below the limit of detection in all tests. Furthermore, these four FFR models showed no loss in collection efficiency, inhalation resistance or visual damage after up to 10 decontamination cycles. Two (2) FFR models showed a slight change in strap elasticity (<9%). These data show that moist heat treatment using a multicooker is a viable option for FFR decontamination in a crisis capacity strategy.","Choi, Y W; Richardson, A W; Sunderman, M; Mladineo, M J; Keyes, P H; Hofacre, K C; Middleton, J K",Lett. appl. microbiol,675,23

They play an important role in gene regulation through binding toa specific region in open reading frames (ORFs) and/or untranslated regions (UTRs) to block the translation processes through either degrading or blocking mRNA resulting in knocking down or suppression of targeted genes. Plants and many organisms protect themselves from viruses through the production of miRNAs, which are complementary to 3UTR of viruses resulting in degrading the viral mRNA or block the translation on ribosomes. As pandemic, COVID-19, and its consequences on the global economy, we hypothesized a new approach for the treatment of COVID-19 paints. This approach includes designing a mix of miRNAs targeting several regions on COVID-19 open reading frame (ORF) and 3 UTR and suitable delivery system targeting respiratory system tissues. These synthesized miRNAs may be delivered to humansinnon-viral delivery systems such as liposomes like exosome (extracellular vesicle), polymer-based carriers, or inorganic nanoparticles, which are considered to be more suitable for human use.","El-Nabi, Sobhy Hassab; Elhiti, Mohamed; El-Sheekh, Mostafa",Med Hypotheses,675,16

Tocilizumab (TCZ) in patients with severe COVID-19 could be an effective treatment. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective case-control study in the Nord Franche-Comté Hospital, France. We compared the outcome of patients treated with TCZ and patients without TCZ considering a combined primary endpoint: death and/or ICU admissions. RESULTS: Patients with TCZ (n=20) had a higher Charlson comorbidity index (5.3 [±2.4] vs 3.4 [±2.6], P=0.014), presented with more severe forms (higher level of oxygen therapy at 13L/min vs 6L/min, P<0.001), and had poorer biological findings (severe lymphopenia: 676/mm3 vs 914/mm3, P=0.037 and higher CRP level: 158mg/L vs 105mg/L, P=0.017) than patients without TCZ (n=25). However, death and/or ICU admissions were higher in patients without TCZ than in the TCZ group (72% vs 25%, P=0.002). CONCLUSION: Despite the small sample size and retrospective nature of the work, this result strongly suggests that TCZ may reduce the number of ICU admissions and/or mortality in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.","Klopfenstein, T; Zayet, S; Lohse, A; Balblanc, J-C; Badie, J; Royer, P-Y; Toko, L; Mezher, C; Kadiane-Oussou, N J; Bossert, M; Bozgan, A-M; Charpentier, A; Roux, M-F; Contreras, R; Mazurier, I; Dussert, P; Gendrin, V; Conrozier, T",Med Mal Infect,675,20

An evidence-based decision is important to ensure that patients are receiving the best treatment proven to reduce healing time and improve outcomes, including economic benefits and patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Due to recent restrictions because of the COVID-19 pandemic, including closure of wound care centres within hospitals and a drop in patient volume, chronic wound management needs simple-to-use dressings which are still effective and evidence-based solutions. This systematic review was conducted to identify the clinical evidence available on a sucrose octasulfate dressing (TLC-NOSF, UrgoStart dressing range, Laboratoires Urgo, France) to explore its efficacy in the management of chronic wounds, particularly lower limb ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers. METHOD: A literature search of PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar was conducted based on the PICO model (patient/population, intervention, comparison and outcomes) to retrieve publications of different levels of evidence in order to evaluate outcomes of the use of TLC-NOSF dressings. RESULTS: A total of 21 publications of different levels, ranging from double-blind randomised control trials to case reports, involving over 12,000 patients, were identified through PubMed, with a further eight publications through Google Scholar and two publications through Cochrane Library. A total of seven results were omitted due to the lack of relevance or repetition. CONCLUSION: All the evidence provided suggest that these dressings provide clinicians with an evidence-based option for the management of chronic wounds; that the TLC-NOSF dressings are beneficial in promoting the healing process, reducing healing times, enhancing patients' HRQoL, and in allowing a more cost-effective procedure.","Nair, Harikrishna; Venkateshwaran, N; Seetharaman S, Selva; Deng, Wuquan; Uthaipaisanwong, Apinan; Galea, Emilio",J Wound Care,675,16

The current analysis aimed to investigate the predictors of healing among Italian COVID-19 patients. We also assessed the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on the outcome. METHODS: We designed a cross-sectional, observational, multicenter, nationwide survey in Italy to explore the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. We analyzed information from 2446 charts of Italian patients admitted for certified COVID-19 in 27 hospitals. Healing from COVID-19 infection, defined as two consecutive negative swabs, was reported in 544 patients (22.2%), 95% of them were hospitalized. RESULTS: Age and Charlson Comorbidity Index were significantly lower in healing compared with nonhealing patients (63â±â15 vs. 69â±â15 and 2â±â2 vs. 3â±â2, both Pâ<â0.05). In multivariable regression model, predictors of healing were younger age (OR: 0.99; 95% CI 0.98-0.99, Pâ=â0.0001), absence of chronic kidney disease (OR: 0.35; 95% CI 0.17-0.70, Pâ=â0.003) or heart failure (OR: 0.44; 95% CI, 0.28-0.70, Pâ=â0.001). In the subgroup of patients suffering from hypertension and/or heart failure (nâ=â1498), no differences were observed in the use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that younger age and absence of comorbidities play a major role in determining healing in patients with COVID-19. No effects of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on the outcome was reported.","Mancusi, Costantino; Grassi, Guido; Borghi, Claudio; Carugo, Stefano; Fallo, Francesco; Ferri, Claudio; Giannattasio, Cristina; Grassi, Davide; Letizia, Claudio; Minuz, Pietro; Muiesan, Maria Lorenza; Perlini, Stefano; Pucci, Giacomo; Rizzoni, Damiano; Salvetti, Massimo; Sarzani, Riccardo; Sechi, Leonardo; Veglio, Franco; Volpe, Massimo; Iaccarino, Guido",J Hypertens,675,1

The fecundity evidence,7.2726865,7.823006,2021,"Background: For the preventive treatment of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) an unprecedented global research effort studied the safety and efficacy of new vaccine platforms that have not been previously used in humans. Less than one year after the discovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral sequence, these vaccines were approved for use in the European Union (EU) as well as in numerous other countries and mass vaccination efforts began. The so far in the EU approved mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 are based on similar lipid-based nanoparticle carrier technologies; however, the lipid components differ. Severe allergic reactions and anaphylaxis after COVID-19 vaccination are very rare adverse events but have drawn attention due to potentially lethal outcomes and have triggered a high degree of uncertainty. Methods: Current knowledge on anaphylactic reactions to vaccines and specifically the new mRNA COVID-19 vaccines was compiled using a literature search in Medline, PubMed, as well as the national and international study and guideline registries, the Cochrane Library, and the Internet, with special reference to official websites of the World Health Organization (WHO), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert Koch Institute (RKI), and Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI). Results: Based on the international literature and previous experience, recommendations for prophylaxis, diagnosis and therapy of these allergic reactions are given by a panel of experts. Conclusion: Allergy testing is not necessary for the vast majority of allergic patients prior to COVID-19 vaccination with currently licensed vaccines. In case of allergic/anaphylactic reactions after vaccination, allergy workup is recommended, as it is for a small potential risk population prior to the first vaccination. Evaluation and approval of diagnostic tests should be done for this purpose.","Klimek, Ludger; Bergmann, Karl-Christian; Brehler, Randolf; Pfützner, Wolfgang; Zuberbier, Torsten; Hartmann, Karin; Jakob, Thilo; Novak, Natalija; Ring, Johannes; Merk, Hans; Hamelmann, Eckard; Ankermann, Tobias; Schmidt, Sebastian; Untersmayr, Eva; Hötzenecker, Wolfram; Jensen-Jarolim, Erika; Brockow, Knut; Mahler, Vera; Worm, Margitta",Allergo J Int,675,6

The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on educational systems has further increased the significance of e-learning. Accordingly, gaining a full understanding of the general topics and trends in e-learning studies is critical for a deeper comprehension of the field. There are many studies that provide such a picture of the e-learning field, but the limitation is that they do not examine the field as a whole. This study aimed to investigate the emerging trends in the e-learning field by implementing a topic modeling analysis based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) on 41,925 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2000 and 2019. The analysis revealed 16 topics reflecting emerging trends and developments in the e-learning field. Among these, the topics “MOOC,” “learning assessment,” and “elearning systems” were found to be key topics in the field, with a consistently high volume. In addition, the topics of “learning algorithms,” “learning factors,” and “adaptive learning” were observed to have the highest overall acceleration, with the first two identified as having a higher acceleration in recent years. Going by these results, it is concluded that the next decade of e-learning studies will focus on learning factors and algorithms, which will possibly create a baseline for more individualized and adaptive mobile platforms. In other words, after a certain maturity level is reached by better understanding the learning process through these identified learning factors and algorithms, the next generation of e-learning systems will be built on individualized and adaptive learning environments. These insights could be useful for e-learning communities to improve their research efforts and their applications in the field accordingly. © 2021.

However, biosecurity is not only about protecting human life. This issue brings together mini-reviews examining recent developments and thinking around some of the tools, behaviours and concepts around biosecurity. They illustrate the multi-disciplinary nature of the subject, demonstrating the interface between research and policy. Biosecurity practices aim to prevent the spread of harmful organisms; recognising that 2020 is the International Year of Plant Health, several focus on plant biosecurity although invasive species and animal health concerns are also captured. The reviews show progress in developing early warning systems and that plant protection organisations are increasingly using tools that compare multiple pest threats to prioritise responses. The bespoke modelling of threats can inform risk management responses and synergies between meteorology and biosecurity provide opportunities for increased collaboration. There is scope to develop more generic models, increasing their accessibility to policy makers. Recent research can improve pest surveillance programs accounting for real-world constraints. Social science examining individual farmer behaviours has informed biosecurity policy; taking a broader socio-cultural approach to better understand farming networks has the potential to change behaviours in a new way. When encouraging public recreationists to adopt positive biosecurity behaviours communications must align with their values. Bringing together the human, animal, plant and environmental health sectors to address biosecurity risks in a common and systematic manner within the One Biosecurity concept can be achieved through multi-disciplinary working involving the life, physical and social sciences with the support of legislative bodies and the public.","MacLeod, Alan; Spence, Nicola",Emerg Top Life Sci,675,20

In this Perspective paper, we summarize current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 and aging, in order to understand why older people are more affected by COVID-19. We discuss about the possibility that the so-called ""immunosenescence"" and ""inflammaging"" processes, already present in a fraction of frail older adults, could allow the immune escape of SARS-CoV-2 leading to COVID-19 serious complications.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the prevalence of common misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an online survey via social media platforms and a survey company to determine whether respondents have been exposed to a broad set of false claims and fact-checked information on the disease. RESULTS: We obtained more than 41,000 responses from 1257 participants in 85 countries, but for our analysis, we only included responses from 35 countries that had at least 15 respondents. We identified a strong negative correlation between a country's Gross Domestic Product per-capita and the prevalence of misinformation, with poorer countries having a higher prevalence of misinformation (Spearman &#961;=-0.72; P<.001). We also found that fact checks spread to a lesser degree than their respective false claims, following a sublinear trend (ß=.64). CONCLUSIONS: Our results imply that the potential harm of misinformation could be more substantial for low-income countries than high-income countries. Countries with poor infrastructures might have to combat not only the spreading pandemic but also the COVID-19 infodemic, which can derail efforts in saving lives.","Cha, Meeyoung; Cha, Chiyoung; Singh, Karandeep; Lima, Gabriel; Ahn, Yong-Yeol; Kulshrestha, Juhi; Varol, Onur",JMIR Hum Factors,675,16

We aimed to investigate the effect of control measures and holiday seasons on the incidence and mortality rate of COVID-19 in Iran. STUDY DESIGN: An observational study. METHODS: The daily data of confirmed new cases and deaths in Iran were taken from the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 database. We calculated weekly data from 19 Feb to 6 Oct 2020. To estimate the impact of control measures and holiday seasons on the incidence rate of new cases and deaths, an autoregressive hidden Markov model (ARHMM) with two hidden states fitted the data. The hidden states of the fitted model can distinguish the peak period from the non-peak period. RESULTS: The control measures with a delay of one-week and two-week had a decreasing effect on the new cases in the peak and non-peak periods, respectively (P=0.005). The holiday season with a two-week delay increased the total number of new cases in the peak periods (P=0.031). The peak period for the occurrence of COVID-19 was estimated at 3 weeks. In the peak period of mortality, the control measures with a three-week delay decreased the COVID-19 mortality (P=0.010). The expected duration of staying in the peak period of mortality was around 6 weeks. CONCLUSION: When an increasing trend was seen in the country, the control measures could decline the incidence and mortality related to COVID-19. Implementation of official restrictions on holiday seasons could prevent an upward trend of incidence for COVID-19 during the peak period.","Haji-Maghsoudi, Saiedeh; Sadeghifar, Majid; Roshanaei, Ghodratollah; Mahjub, Hossein",J Res Health Sci,675,29

The analyzed variables to reflect the robustness of the banking system were the domestic credit to the private sector and the nonperforming loans (NPL) rate. Those indicators are of high relevance and concern within the current pandemic context. The results show that the banking development degree influences the increase of private-sector lending and the decrease of the NPL rate. Social and governance factors impact differently the level of private sector and NPL rate. All macroeconomic indicators used to influence the level of private-sector lending.

METHODS: This was a simple random study in which ophthalmologists practicing in Saudi Arabia were asked to fill in a self-administered online survey during the period from March 28, 2020, to April 04, 2020. Four validated psychiatric assessment tools were used to detect symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and stress perception. RESULTS: One hundred and seven participants successfully completed the survey with a response rate of 30.6%. Males constituted 56.1% (n = 60). Ophthalmology residents constituted the majority (n = 66, 61.7%). About half of the physicians exhibited symptoms of depression (n = 56, 50.5%), anxiety (n = 50, 46.7%), and insomnia (n = 48, 44.9%). Symptoms of stress ranged between low (28%), moderate (68.2%), and high (3.7%). According to the cutoff values for severe symptoms, 29% were identified as having depression, 38.3% had anxiety, and 15% had insomnia.Depression was found to be more common among female ophthalmologists (P = 0.06), those living with an elderly (P = 0.003), and fellows (P = 0.006). Female ophthalmologists suffering from anxiety were significantly more than male ophthalmologists (P = 0.046). There was a trend toward suffering from anxiety in frontline health-care providers (P = 0.139) and in ophthalmologists who are living with an elderly (P = 0.149). Female participants exhibited significantly more moderate-to-high symptoms of stress (P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmologists' psychological needs, females in particular, should be addressed appropriately during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A field survey was conducted at Central, Tokachi, and North areas of Hokkaido, three or four times a year. At each farm, an interview questionnaire for farm basal data was conducted, and 500 ml of bulk tank milk sample was obtained. Fatty acid composition, and vitamin and carotenoid concentrations in the milk samples were determined. In Central and Tokachi areas, corn silage was used as the main forage. In North area, fresh herbage was the dominant feed in the summer season, and grass hay was the main feed in the winter season.

Cancer patients and survivors may be disproportionately affected by these changes, including decreased access to healthcare, increased infection risk, and economic challenges. We sought to determine the effects of the pandemic on thyroid cancer survivors’ quality of life. Methods: An anonymous web-based survey was administered in collaboration with ThyCa: Thyroid Cancer Survivors’ Association, consisting of questions about (1) demographics, (2) thyroid cancer clinical characteristics, (3) attitudes toward and impact of COVID-19, and (4) the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 29-item profile. The survey was linked on the ThyCa homepage. PROMIS measures were scored using item response theory models with a T-score metric relative to U.S. reference data via the HealthMeasures Scoring Service (https://www.healthmeasures.net). T-scores were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon signed-rank, Kruskal-Wallis, and Spearman’s rank correlation tests. Results: From 5/6/2020 - 10/8/2020, 505 participants accessed the survey, and all completed surveys by U.S.-based thyroid cancer survivors were analyzed (n=378, 75%). Mean age was 53 years, 89% were female, 90% were white, 74% had papillary thyroid cancer, 97% had surgery, and 70% received radioactive iodine. The vast majority agreed or strongly agreed (83%) that their lives were very different during COVID-19, as was the way they interacted with their doctors (79%). Less than half (43%) agreed or strongly agreed that they were satisfied with the amount of information from their doctor’s office regarding COVID-19 changes. Compared to previously-published PROMIS data for this population, T-scores were significantly higher in the domain of anxiety/fear (57.8 vs. 56.5, p&amp;lt;0.01) and lower for ability to participate in social roles and activities (46.2 vs. 48.1, p&amp;lt;0.01). Younger age was weakly correlated with greater anxiety/fear (Spearman’s rho=-0.38, p&amp;lt;0.01), and greater anxiety/fear was associated with pending treatment (p&amp;lt;0.01), lower cancer stage (p=0.01), and female sex (p=0.02). Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, thyroid cancer survivors reported increased anxiety/fear and decreased social participation. In our efforts to care for patients both physically and mentally as the pandemic continues, we must better understand their fears and concerns and improve communication about potential changes to their care.","Graves, Claire E.; Goyal, Neha Levin Anna Nuno Miriam A.; Kim, Jina Campbell Michael J.; Shen, Wen T.; Gosnell, Jessica Erin Roman Sanziana Sosa Julie Ann Duh Quan-Yang Suh Insoo",Journal of the Endocrine Society,675,20

Online channel-based messaging apps such as Slack offer an opportunity to engage students in remote, multimodal collaborative learning by reproducing a classroom environment in the virtual space. AIM: To determine the feasibility, acceptability and proof of concept for an online Slack community in undergraduate dermatology education. METHODS: Undergraduate medical students participated in an online classroom for a 6-week programme encompassing case-based discussions, seminars and journal clubs. The platform was facilitated by junior doctors (n = 10) and patient educators (n = 6). Students and faculty completed a post-course evaluation. Students additionally completed a pre- and post-intervention dermatology quiz. Mixed methods analyses included quantitative analyses to explore data trends and qualitative phenomenographic analyses to assimilate key underlying themes. RESULTS: Students (n = 65) were enrolled to join the platform. The evaluation was completed by students (n = 52) from UK universities (n = 27). The majority of students (n = 27) interacted with the platform as passive observers (&#8804; 5 active interactions with the channel), with a small group (n = 4) of 'super-users' (&#8805; 100 active interactions). The overall quality of the course was described as 'excellent' by 96% of participants and 100% of faculty. CONCLUSION: A community-based online classroom can act as an enjoyable, acceptable and collaborative means of delivering dermatology education to undergraduate medical students. Its ease of use and supportive nature may also facilitate patient involvement. Such advances may provide vital safeguards against the reduction in F2F learning that has accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic.","Phillips, A L; Edwards, S; Parmesar, K; Soltan, M; Guckian, J",Clin Exp Dermatol,675,29

This study aimed to identify immediate areas for system strengthening by comparing the delivery of elective cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic in periods of lockdown versus light restriction. METHODS: This international, prospective, cohort study enrolled 20 006 adult (≥18 years) patients from 466 hospitals in 61 countries with 15 cancer types, who had a decision for curative surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic and were followed up until the point of surgery or cessation of follow-up (Aug 31, 2020). Average national Oxford COVID-19 Stringency Index scores were calculated to define the government response to COVID-19 for each patient for the period they awaited surgery, and classified into light restrictions (index <20), moderate lockdowns (20–60), and full lockdowns (>60). The primary outcome was the non-operation rate (defined as the proportion of patients who did not undergo planned surgery). Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used to explore the associations between lockdowns and non-operation. Intervals from diagnosis to surgery were compared across COVID-19 government response index groups. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04384926. FINDINGS: Of eligible patients awaiting surgery, 2003 (10·0%) of 20 006 did not receive surgery after a median follow-up of 23 weeks (IQR 16–30), all of whom had a COVID-19-related reason given for non-operation. Light restrictions were associated with a 0·6% non-operation rate (26 of 4521), moderate lockdowns with a 5·5% rate (201 of 3646; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0·81, 95% CI 0·77–0·84; p<0·0001), and full lockdowns with a 15·0% rate (1775 of 11 827; HR 0·51, 0·50–0·53; p<0·0001). In sensitivity analyses, including adjustment for SARS-CoV-2 case notification rates, moderate lockdowns (HR 0·84, 95% CI 0·80–0·88; p<0·001), and full lockdowns (0·57, 0·54–0·60; p<0·001), remained independently associated with non-operation. Surgery beyond 12 weeks from diagnosis in patients without neoadjuvant therapy increased during lockdowns (374 [9·1%] of 4521 in light restrictions, 317 [10·4%] of 3646 in moderate lockdowns, 2001 [23·8%] of 11 827 in full lockdowns), although there were no differences in resectability rates observed with longer delays. INTERPRETATION: Cancer surgery systems worldwide were fragile to lockdowns, with one in seven patients who were in regions with full lockdowns not undergoing planned surgery and experiencing longer preoperative delays. Although short-term oncological outcomes were not compromised in those selected for surgery, delays and non-operations might lead to long-term reductions in survival. During current and future periods of societal restriction, the resilience of elective surgery systems requires strengthening, which might include protected elective surgical pathways and long-term investment in surge capacity for acute care during public health emergencies to protect elective staff and services.

Maximal increase of aminopeptidase N occurred after treatment with 1 μM dexamethasone for 3 days. Actinomycin D, a blocker of RNA synthesis, and cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, did not alter basal aminopeptidase N activity. However, they prevented stimulation by dexamethasone.

However, when the virus enters the body it also interacts with the micro-organisms already inhabiting the host. Understanding the virus-host-microbiome interactions can yield additional insights into the biological processes perturbed by viral invasion. Alterations in the gut microbiome species and metabolites have been noted during respiratory viral infections, possibly impacting the lungs via gut-lung microbiome crosstalk. To better characterize microbial functions in the lower respiratory tract during COVID-19 infection, we carry out a functional analysis of previously published metatranscriptome sequencing data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from eight COVID-19 cases, twenty-five community-acquired pneumonia patients, and twenty healthy controls. The functional profiles resulting from comparing the sequences against annotated microbial protein domains clearly separate the cohorts. By examining the associated metabolic pathways, distinguishing functional signatures in COVID-19 respiratory tract microbiomes are identified, including decreased potential for lipid metabolism and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism pathways, and increased potential for carbohydrate metabolism pathways. The results include overlap between previous studies on COVID-19 microbiomes, including decrease in the glycosaminoglycan degradation pathway and increase in carbohydrate metabolism. The results also suggest novel connections to consider, possibly specific to the lower respiratory tract microbiome, calling for further research on microbial functions and host-microbiome interactions during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Haiminen, Niina; Utro, Filippo; Seabolt, Ed; Parida, Laxmi",Sci Rep,675,20

We explore the direct bidirectional relationships between the COVID-19 virus and the gut and lung microbiomes. We then consider the significant indirect effects of the pandemic, such as repeated lockdowns, increased hand hygiene, and changes to mood and diet, that could all lead to longstanding changes to the gut microbiome at an individual and a population level. Together, these changes may affect long term microbiome research, both in observational as well as in population studies, requiring urgent attention. Finally, we explore the unique implications for clinical trials using faecal microbiota transplants (FMT), which are increasingly investigated as potential treatments for a range of diseases. The pandemic introduces new barriers to participation in trials, while the direct and indirect effects laid out above can present a confounding factor.

She had severe pancytopenia & BMB confirmed relapsed AML. She had slightly raised LFT. Urine grew Ent. fecium. Antibiotics & voriconazole were used. She remained febrile over next 2 days. CT chest revealed extensive bilateral consolidation. She needed O2 up to 5L/Min for few days. RT-PCR for MERS-CoV was positive from NPS. She was initiated on oseltamivir. She became afebrile after 2 days & repeated RT-PCR for MERS-CoV was negative. Fludara, Ara-C (FA) chemo was started. She remained neutropenic for next 4 weeks but there was no recurrence of respiratory symptoms. BMB on day 28 of FA confirmed CR. CT chest revealed complete resolution of air space opacities. She was discharged with plan to undergo matched sibling donor Allo-HSCT. Patient #4 A 76-yr-old male with H/O HTN & CKD was diagnosed to have IgA κ MM. He was started on MPV chemo as inpatient due to logistic reasons. After 3 cycles of MPV, serum free κ chains decreased by 91% but remained on dialysis. On 21 April, 2014 he developed cough, SOB & fever. CXR revealed bilateral infiltrates & antibiotics were started. He worsened over next few days & CXR showed worsening bilateral consolidation. Eventually he needed intubation. He was treated with antimicrobials including voriconazole & oseltamir. RT-PCR for MERS-CoV was positive from NPS. Unfortunately he died few days later. Discussion: Patients with hematological malignancies are at increased risk of community & hospital-acquired infections. Recent outbreak of MERS-CoV infection has created a havoc among hematologists community. There is uncertainty about impact of MERS-CoV infection on continuation of chemo. We report 4 cases of hematological malignancies with MERS-CoV infection. Three of the 4 patients developed severe pneumonia & required intubation (2 died later) & one had milder form of pneumonia treated in isolation room. In addition to supportive care, all 4 received antimicrobials & oseltamivir. Chemo was safe soon after recovery from infection in the surviving 2 patients. We propose that during MERS-CoV epidemics, pneumonia can be treated with supportive care, antibiotics & oseltamivir. Chemo can be continued for the malignant disease soon after recovery. Further reports are needed to confirm our findings.
