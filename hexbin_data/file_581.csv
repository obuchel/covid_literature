Results were compared to those obtained with DNA sequencing of three rRNA gene loci, i.e., the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, D1/D2 domain of the 28S rRNA gene and intergenic spacer 1 (IGS1) region. Using species-specific, or group-specific probes targeted at the ITS region and the D1/D2 domain, the RLB assay permitted accurate species identification of all 48 isolates with 100% specificity. Species-specific RLB probes correctly assigned 45/48 (94%) of the isolates (six species) with the exception of T. dermatis and T. japonicum isolates which were not targeted by the assay. Identification of T. dermatis relied on a positive hybridization result with the group-specific probe hybridizing with T. dermatis and T. jirovecii and the absence of a signal with the T. jirovecii-specific probe. T. japonicum strains were first assigned to the T. asahii-T. japonicum group by hybridization with the two species group-specific probe and then as T. japonicum by the absence of signal with a T. asahii-specific probe. Twelve species-specific RCA probes targeting the eight species studied detected templates of all 48 Trichosporon isolates and an artificial template of T. asteroides, all with good specificity. Both RLB and RCA are potential alternatives to DNA sequencing for the identification of Trichosporon species. The RLB approach is suited for the batched simultaneous analysis of large numbers of isolates, while RCA is more appropriate for the immediate study of single isolates. Comparative costs are US$7 and US$2 per assay for the RLB and RCA methods, respectively.","Xiao, Meng; Guo, Li-Na; Kong, Fanrong; Wang, He; Sorrell, Tania C.; Li, Ruo-Yu; Jiang, Wei; Chen, Sharon C-A.; Xu, Ying-Chun",Sabouraudia,581,5
20553,20553,20553,A Glance at the Rearview Mirror,20.456762,-0.048673656,2021-07-15,"Breast cancer has historically been a disease for which immunotherapy was largely unavailable. Recently, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced/metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has demonstrated efficacy, including longer progression-free survival and increased overall survival in subsets of patients. Based on clinical benefit in randomized trials, ICIs in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of some patients with advanced/metastatic TNBC have been approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), expanding options for patients. Ongoing questions remain, however, about the optimal chemotherapy backbone for immunotherapy, appropriate biomarker-based selection of patients for treatment, the optimal strategy for immunotherapy treatment in earlier stage disease, and potential use in histological subtypes other than TNBC. To provide guidance to the oncology community on these and other important concerns, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop a clinical practice guideline (CPG). The expert panel drew upon the published literature as well as their clinical experience to develop recommendations for healthcare professionals on these important aspects of immunotherapeutic treatment for breast cancer, including diagnostic testing, treatment planning, immune-related adverse events (irAEs), and patient quality of life (QOL) considerations. The evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations in this CPG are intended to give guidance to cancer care providers treating patients with breast cancer.","Emens, Leisha A; Adams, Sylvia; Cimino-Mathews, Ashley; Disis, Mary L; Gatti-Mays, Margaret E; Ho, Alice Y; Kalinsky, Kevin; McArthur, Heather L; Mittendorf, Elizabeth A; Nanda, Rita; Page, David B; Rugo, Hope S; Rubin, Krista M; Soliman, Hatem; Spears, Patricia A; Tolaney, Sara M; Litton, Jennifer K",J Immunother Cancer,581,30

Health information technologies (HITs) have recently emerged as a viable intervention to mitigate the burden of ASCVD. Approximately 60% of US adults report searching the internet for health information; however, previous research has not examined the prevalence of general technology or HIT use among adults with and without ASCVD. In addition, social determinants in HIT use among adults with ASCVD are not well understood. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and social determinants of HIT use among US adults with versus without self-reported ASCVD. METHODS: We pooled cross-sectional data from the 2011-2018 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to examine the general technology and HIT use among adults aged ≥18 years with and without self-reported ASCVD (coronary heart disease, stroke, or both). General technology use was defined as mobile phone ownership, internet use, and computer use. HIT use was defined as looking up health information on the internet, filling a web-based prescription, scheduling a medical appointment on the internet, communicating with a health care provider by email, or using web-based group chats to learn about health topics. We evaluated sociodemographic differences in HIT use among respondents by using Poisson regression. Analyses were weighted according to NHIS standards. RESULTS: A total sample of 256,117 individuals were included, of which 2194 (0.9%) reported prior ASCVD. Among adults with prior ASCVD, the mean age was 70.6 (SD 11.5) years, and 47.4% (1048/2194) of the adults were females. General technology use differed between participants with and without prior ASCVD, with 36.0% (614/1826) and 76.2% (157,642/213,816) indicating internet usage and 24.6% (374/1575) and 60.7% (107,742/184,557) indicating using a computer every day, respectively. Similarly, adults with ASCVD were less likely to use HIT than those without ASCVD (515/2194, 25.1% vs 123,966/253,923, 51.0%; P<.001). Among adults with prior ASCVD, social determinants that were associated with HIT use included younger age, higher education, higher income, being employed, and being married. CONCLUSIONS: HIT use was low among adults with a history of ASCVD, which may represent a barrier to delivering care via emerging HIT. Given the associations with social determinants such as income, education, and employment, targeted strategies and policies are needed to eliminate barriers to impact HIT usage.","Nwokeji, Uchenna; Spaulding, Erin M; Shan, Rongzi; Turkson-Ocran, Ruth-Alma; Baptiste, Diana; Koirala, Binu; Plante, Timothy B; Martin, Seth S; Commodore-Mensah, Yvonne",J Med Internet Res,581,30

In particular, more informal, highly interactive courses such as project seminars need to be adapted to the online format. How can the opportunities of digital learning formats be utilized, and potential problems be reduced? In this paper, we contrast the implementation of a project seminar in the form of a hackathon in presence vs. online format. Based on the state of the art of research, we compare the concepts, their execution, and the results of these two modes. The thematic focus of the hackathons was the use of open data in the public sector (Open Data Hackathon).

They have also produced unprecedented exploitation of Earth's life support systems, moving the planet into a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene-one defined by human influence on natural systems. The health sector has been complicit in this influence. Bioethics, too, must acknowledge its role-the environmental threats that will shape human health in this century represent a 'perfect moral storm' challenging the ethical theories of the last. The US conservationist Aldo Leopold saw this gathering storm more clearly than many, and in his Land Ethic describes the beginnings of a route to safe passage. Its starting point is a reinterpretation of the ethical relationship between humanity and the 'land community', the ecosystems we live within and depend upon; moving us from 'conqueror' to 'plain member and citizen' of that community. The justice of the Land Ethic questions many presuppositions implicit to discussions of the topic in biomedical ethics. By valuing the community in itself-in a way irreducible to the welfare of its members-it steps away from the individualism axiomatic in contemporary bioethics. Viewing ourselves as citizens of the land community also extends the moral horizons of healthcare from a solely human focus. Taking into account the 'stability' of the community requires intergenerational justice. The resulting vision of justice in healthcare-one that takes climate and environmental justice seriously-could offer health workers an ethic fit for the future.","Wardrope, Alistair",Journal of medical ethics,581,16

The urban water supply and water consumption are affected by the pandemic because it intensified the existing deficits in the urban water supply and sanitation services. In this study, we develop an integrated spatial analysis approach to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on multi-dimensional Urban Water Consumption Patterns (UWCPs) with the aim of forecasting the water demand. We selected the Tabriz metropolitan area as a case study area and applied an integrated approach of GIS spatial analysis and regression-based autocorrelation assessment to develop the UWCPs for 2018, 2019 and 2020. We then employed GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis and a CA-Markov model to analyze the water demand under the impacts of COVID-19 and to forecast the UWCPs for 2021, 2022 and 2023. In addition, we tested the spatial uncertainty of the prediction maps using the Dempster Shafer Theory. The results show that the domestic water consumption increased by 17.57% during the year 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The maximum increase in water consumption was observed in spring 2020 (April-June) when strict quarantine regulations were in place. Based on our results, the annual water deficit in Tabriz has increased from ~18% to about 30% in 2020. In addition, our projections show that this may further increase to about 40-45% in 2021. Relevant stakeholders can use the findings to develop evidence-informed strategies for sustainable water resource management in the post-COVID era. This research also makes other significant contributions. From the environmental perspective, since COVID-19 has affected resource management in many parts of the world, the proposed method can be applied to similar contexts to mitigate the adverse impacts and developed better informed recovery plans.","Feizizadeh, Bakhtiar; Omarzadeh, Davoud; Ronagh, Zahra; Sharifi, Ayyoob; Blaschke, Thomas; Lakes, Tobia",The Science of the total environment,581,8

MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases up until 2 February 2021. The primary outcome was the poor outcome, a composite of mortality and severity. Severe COVID-19 was defined as COVID-19 that fulfill the criteria for severe pneumonia or patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome/disease progression/need for intensive care unit or mechanical ventilation. The effect estimates were a mean difference between patients with and without a poor outcome in mg/dL and odds ratio (OR) per 1 mg/dL decrease in prealbumin level. The effect estimates were reported with their 95% confidence interval (95% CI). RESULTS Nine studies comprising of 2104 patients were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Patients with poor outcome have lower prealbumin level (mean difference -71.48 mg/dL [95% CI -93.74, -49.22], p<0.001; I2: 85.9%). Every 1 mg/dL decrease in prealbumin level was associated with 1% increase in poor outcome (OR 0.992 [0.987, 0.997], p=0.004, I2: 81.7%). Meta-regression analysis showed that the association between the prealbumin level and poor outcome varies with gender (male) (coefficient: 3.50, R2: 100%, p<0.001), but not age, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSIONS Low serum prealbumin was associated with poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.","Akbar, M R; Pranata, R; Wibowo, A; Lim, M A; Sihite, T A; Martha, J W",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,581,29

For all its controversy, the implementation of Step 2 CS in 2004 brought about profound changes to the landscape of medical education, altering the curriculum and assessment practices of medical schools to ensure students were prepared to take and pass this licensing exam. Its elimination, while celebrated by some, is not without potential negative consequences. As the responsibility for assessing students' clinical skills shifts back to medical schools, educators must take care not to lose the ground they have gained in advancing clinical skills education.

OBJECTIVES To pilot a multicomponent intervention involving: an introductory letter describing a new clinic initiative and inviting patients to complete a patient-family pre-visit agenda-setting checklist, share their electronic health information with family, and talk about their wishes for future care with a trained ACP facilitator (SHARING Choices). METHODS SHARING Choices was delivered to 40 patient-family dyads from 3 primary care clinics. Facilitators completed post-ACP reports. Patient and family participants completed baseline and 6-week surveys. RESULTS Patients were on average 75 years (range 65-90). Family were spouses (85.0%) or adult children (15.0%). At 6 weeks, nearly half of dyads participated in ACP conversations (n = 19) or used the agenda-setting checklist (n = 17), one-third (n = 13) registered family to access the patient's portal account, and most (n = 28) provided the primary care team with a new or previously completed advance directive. Of 12 patients who screened positive for cognitive impairment, 9 completed ACP conversations and 10 provided the clinic with an advance directive. ACP engagement, measured on a 4-point scale, was comparatively lower at baseline and 6 weeks among family (3.05 and 3.19) than patients (3.56 and 3.54). Patients remarked that SHARING Choices clarified communication and preferences while family reported a better understanding of their role in ACP and communication.

Blood samples from 91 melioidosis patients and 100 healthy donors from northeast Thailand were examined for immune responses against B. pseudomallei Hcp1, AhpC, TssM and LolC using a variety of cellular and humoral immune assays including IFN-Î³ ELISpot assays, flow cytometry and ELISA. PHA and a CPI peptide pool were also used as control stimuli in the ELISpot assays. Hcp1 and TssM stimulated strong IFN-Î³ secreting T cell responses in acute melioidosis patients which correlated with survival. High IFN-Î³ secreting CD4+ T cell responses were observed during acute melioidosis. Interestingly, while T cell responses of melioidosis patients against the CPI peptide pool were low at the time of enrollment, the levels increased to the same as in healthy donors by day 28. Although high IgG levels against Hcp1 and AhpC were detected in acute melioidosis patients, no significant differences between survivors and non-survivors were observed. Collectively, these studies help to further our understanding of immunity against disease following natural exposure of humans to B. pseudomallei as well as provide important insights for the selection of candidate antigens for use in the development of safe and effective melioidosis subunit vaccines.","Sengyee, Sineenart; Yarasai, Atchara; Janon, Rachan; Morakot, Chumpol; Ottiwet, Orawan; Schmidt, Lindsey K; West, T Eoin; Burtnick, Mary N; Chantratita, Narisara; Brett, Paul J",Front Immunol,581,1

Objectives: A systematic review was carried out to determine the available empirical evidence in relation to the characteristics, content and effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving environmental and psychosocial risk factors for older people, from the perspective of age-friendly communities and the promotion of active ageing. Methods: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the studies retained in this review were identified through a systematic search of the academic literature in selected electronic databases including Web of Science and Scopus. Independent critical appraisal and data extraction were conducted by two reviewers. The checklist was used to assess the quality of the articles. Findings: The search identified 1020 potentially eligible documents, of which 11 satisfied the established criteria. Non-exhaustive practices prevailed over rigorous investigations, with a high proportion of studies observed to be of low methodological quality and at high risk of bias. This reflected the predominance of uncontrolled interventions. Environmental interventions were focused on reducing risk and adapting the everyday environmental setting, while psychosocial interventions prioritised social strategies (behavioural changes, promotion of participation) and training. Interventions were more effective in certain domains of age-friendly cities and communities such as transportation and housing, followed by increased participation as a lifestyle-related behavioural change. The inferred changes were associated with providing information and enhancing skills; modifying access, barriers, exposures, and opportunities; enhancing services and support; continuity and effectiveness of changes over time; and modifying policies based on the bottom-up approach of age-friendly cities and communities (AFCC). Discussion and conclusion: Interventions focused on personal and organisational aspects might have positive effects in the longer term. However, fewer changes would be observed in interventions revolving around changing lifestyles owing to the impact of complex multi-causal factors. The relative effectiveness in terms of health calls into question the design of interventions and the supposed “friendliness” of certain communities. There is a need to encourage sound longitudinal research aimed at providing key knowledge for the implementation and evaluation of public policies, and to encourage age-friendly community programmes to promote active ageing.","Sánchez-González, Diego; Rojo-Pérez, Fermina; Rodríguez-Rodríguez, Vicente; Fernández-Mayoralas, Gloria",Int J Environ Res Public Health,581,33

A high overall prevalence of depressive symptoms (16%), anxiety (11.7%), and post-traumatic stress (14.9%) were identified. A higher prevalence of depressive, anxious, or stress symptoms was identified in the general population (28.6%) compared to health-care workers (17.9%). The triad model of fear of COVID-19, anxiety, and stress presented adequate goodness-of-fit indices for both groups. A model was identified that manages to explain depressive symptoms in more than 70% of the general population and health-care workers, based on the variables of the triad (CFI = 0.94; TLI = 0.94; RMSEA = 0.06; SRMR = 0.06). In the general population post-traumatic stress mediated the relationship between anxiety and depression (β = 0.12; 95%CI = 0.06 to 0.18) which was significant, but the indirect effect of post-traumatic stress was not significant in health care workers (β = 0.03; 95%CI = − 0.11 to 0.19). LIMITATIONS: The prevalence estimates relied on self-reported information. Other variables of interest, such as intolerance to uncertainty or income level, could not be evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Our study proposes and tests one model that explains more than 70% of depressive symptoms. This explanatory model can be used in health contexts and populations to determine how emotional factors can affect depressive symptoms.","Villarreal-Zegarra, David; Copez-Lonzoy, Anthony; Vilela-Estrada, Ana L.; Huarcaya-Victoria, Jeff",BMC Psychiatry,581,16
