486,486,486,Ventilatory and ECMO treatment of H1N1-induced severe respiratory failure: results of an Italian referral ECMO center,16.6971,10.304542,2011-01-11,"BACKGROUND: Since the first outbreak of a respiratory illness caused by H1N1 virus in Mexico, several reports have described the need of intensive care or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) assistance in young and often healthy patients. Here we describe our experience in H1N1-induced ARDS using both ventilation strategy and ECMO assistance. METHODS: Following Italian Ministry of Health instructions, an Emergency Service was established at the Careggi Teaching Hospital (Florence, Italy) for the novel pandemic influenza. From Sept 09 to Jan 10, all patients admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Emergency Department with ARDS due to H1N1 infection were studied. All ECMO treatments were veno-venous. H1N1 infection was confirmed by PCR assayed on pharyngeal swab, subglottic aspiration and bronchoalveolar lavage. Lung pathology was evaluated daily by lung ultrasound (LUS) examination. RESULTS: A total of 12 patients were studied: 7 underwent ECMO treatment, and 5 responded to protective mechanical ventilation. Two patients had co-infection by Legionella Pneumophila. One woman was pregnant. In our series, PCR from bronchoalveolar lavage had a 100% sensitivity compared to 75% from pharyngeal swab samples. The routine use of LUS limited the number of chest X-ray examinations and decreased transportation to radiology for CT-scan, increasing patient safety and avoiding the transitory disconnection from ventilator. No major complications occurred during ECMO treatments. In three cases, bleeding from vascular access sites due to heparin infusion required blood transfusions. Overall mortality rate was 8.3%. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, early ECMO assistance resulted safe and feasible, considering the life threatening condition, in H1N1-induced ARDS. Lung ultrasound is an effective mean for daily assessment of ARDS patients.","Cianchi, Giovanni; Bonizzoli, Manuela; Pasquini, Andrea; Bonacchi, Massimo; Zagli, Giovanni; Ciapetti, Marco; Sani, Guido; Batacchi, Stefano; Biondi, Simona; Bernardo, Pasquale; Lazzeri, Chiara; Giovannini, Valtere; Azzi, Alberta; Abbate, Rosanna; Gensini, Gianfranco; Peris, Adriano",BMC Pulm Med,371,22
3267,3267,3267,Predicting Mortality in Patients with Tuberculous Destroyed Lung Receiving Mechanical Ventilation,16.61826,8.981119,2018-06-19,"BACKGROUND: Patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to tuberculous destroyed lung (TDL) have a poor prognosis. The aim of the present retrospective study was to develop a mortality prediction model for TDL patients who require mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Data from consecutive TDL patients who had received mechanical ventilation at a single university-affiliated tertiary care hospital in Korea were reviewed. Binary logistic regression was used to identify factors predicting intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. A TDL on mechanical Ventilation (TDL-Vent) score was calculated by assigning points to variables according to β coefficient values. RESULTS: Data from 125 patients were reviewed. A total of 36 patients (29%) died during ICU admission. On the basis of multivariate analysis, the following factors were included in the TDL-Vent score: age ≥65 years, vasopressor use, and arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio <180. In a second regression model, a modified score was then calculated by adding brain natriuretic peptide. For TDL-Vent scores 0 to 3, the 60-day mortality rates were 11%, 27%, 30%, and 77%, respectively (p<0.001). For modified TDL-Vent scores 0 to ≥3, the 60-day mortality rates were 0%, 21%, 33%, and 57%, respectively (p=0.001). For both the TDL-Vent score and the modified TDL-Vent score, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were larger than that of other illness severity scores. CONCLUSION: The TDL-Vent model identifies TDL patients on mechanical ventilation with a high risk of mortality. Prospective validation studies in larger cohorts are now warranted.","Kim, Won-Young; Kim, Mi-Hyun; Jo, Eun-Jung; Eom, Jung Seop; Mok, Jeongha; Kim, Ki Uk; Park, Hye-Kyung; Lee, Min Ki; Lee, Kwangha",Tuberc Respir Dis (Seoul),371,1
3319,3319,3319,Correlation of microbiological yield with radiographic activity on chest computed tomography in cases of suspected pulmonary tuberculosis,16.534986,8.976939,2018-08-09,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the correlation between microbiological yield and radiographic activity, on chest computed tomography (CT), in suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) cases, despite CT being widely used, clinically. METHODS: We used multicenter retrospective data, obtained from medical records, focusing on the diagnostic performance for definite PTB. We categorized patients into four groups, by radiographic activity: definitely active, probably active, indeterminate activity, and probably inactive. RESULTS: Of the 650 patients included, 316 had culture-confirmed PTB; 190 (29.2%), 323 (49.7%), 70 (10.8%), and 67 (10.3%) were classified into the definitely active, probably active, indeterminate activity, and probably inactive groups, respectively. The corresponding observed culture rates for CT radiographic activity were 61.6%, 60.7%, 4.3% and 0%, respectively. When not only culture rates but TB-PCR and histological results were taken into consideration as definite PTB, it showed 66.6%, 67.2%, 14.3%, and 0% of each CT radiographic activity, respectively. Regarding the diagnostic performance for definite PTB, radiographic activity displayed high sensitivity (97.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 94.6–98.5) and negative predictive values (92.7%, 95% CI, 86.6–96.2), considered definitely and probably active PTB. Apart from PTB, other etiologies, according to radiographic activity, were predominantly respiratory infections such as bacterial pneumonia and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection. CONCLUSIONS: Radiographic activity showed good diagnostic performance, and can be used easily in clinical practice. However, clinicians should consider other possibilities, because radiologic images do not confirm microbiological PTB.","Ko, Yousang; Lee, Ho Young; Park, Yong Bum; Hong, Su Jin; Shin, Jeong Hwan; Choi, Seok Jin; Kim, Changhwan; Park, So Young; Jeong, Jin Young",PLoS One,371,1

The study was based on 17 patients who at a retrospective search have been found to have a monoinfection with herpes simplex virus. The diagnosis was established by isolation of the virus from material obtained during fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) which also included broncho-alveolar lavage and tissue sampling. Fourteen patients had a chest radiograph performed within 24 h of the date of the FOB. Two radiographs showed no abnormalities of the lung parenchyma. The radiographs of the other 12 patients showed lung opacification, predominantly lobar or more extensive and always bilateral. Most patients presented with a mixed airspace and interstitial pattern of opacities, but 11 of 14 showed at least an airspace consolidation. Lobar, segmental, or subsegmental atelectasis was present in 7 patients, and unilateral or bilateral pleural effusion in 8 patients, but only in 1 patient was it a large amount. In contradiction to the literature which reports a high correlation between HSVP and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 11 of 14 patients did not meet the pathophysiological criteria for ARDS. The radiologist may suggest the diagnosis of HSVP when bilateral airspace consolidation or mixed opacities appear in a susceptible group of patients who are not thought to have ARDS or pulmonary edema. The definite diagnosis of HSV pneumonia can be established only on the basis of culture of material obtained by broncho-alveolar lavage.","Umans, U.; Golding, R.; Duraku, S.; Manoliu, R.",Eur Radiol,371,1
6816,6816,6816,Post-ARDS pulmonary fibrosis in patients with H1N1 pneumonia: role of follow-up CT,16.669127,8.834901,2011-10-21,"Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) encompass a group of diseases with a wide range of etiologies and a variety of tissue reactions within the lung. In many instances, a careful evaluation of the tissue reactions will result in a specific diagnosis or at least in a narrow range of differentials, which will assist the clinician to arrive at a definite diagnosis, when combining our interpretation with the clinical presentation of the patient and high-resolution computed tomography. In this review, we will exclude granulomatous pneumonias as well as vascular diseases (primary arterial pulmonary hypertension and vasculitis); however, pulmonary hypertension as a complication of interstitial processes will be mentioned. Few entities of pneumoconiosis presenting as an interstitial process will be included, whereas those with granulomatous reactions will be excluded. Drug reactions will be touched on within interstitial pneumonias, but will not be a major focus. In contrast to the present-day preferred descriptive pattern recognition, it is the author’s strong belief that pathologists should always try to dig out the etiology from a tissue specimen and not being satisfied with just a pattern description. It is the difference of sorting tissue reactions into boxes by their main pattern, without recognizing minor or minute reactions, which sometimes will guide one to the correct etiology-oriented interpretation. In the author’s personal perspective, tissue reactions can even be sorted by their timeliness, and therefore, ordered by the time of appearance, providing an insight into the pathogenesis and course of a disease. Also, underlying immune mechanisms will be discussed briefly as far as they are essential to understand the disease.

Research on how to establish covert communication channel over the above popular public applications has been flourishing in recent years. This paper tries to present a novel and effective method to construct a covert channel over common compressed speech stream by embedding sense information into it. In our method, after analysing the characteristic features of the excitation pulse positions of the ITU-T G.723.1 and G.729A speech codec, we design a novel and effective covert communication channel by finely modulating the codes of excitation pulse positions of the above two codecs in line with the secret information to be hidden. To improve the embedding capacity of the proposed method, we also use all the odd/even characteristics of pulse code positions to conduct information hiding. To test and verify the proposed approach, experiments are conducted on several different scenarios. Experimental results show that our methods and algorithms perform a higher degree of secrecy and sound information embedding efficacy compared with exiting similar methods.","Li, Fufang; Li, Binbin; Huang, Yongfeng; Feng, Yuanyong; Peng, Lingxi; Zhou, Naqin",Neural Comput Appl,371,17

Development of ARDS biomarkers has been in a state of continuous flux during the past four decades. To address ARDS heterogeneity, several studies have recently focused on subphenotyping the disease on the basis of observable clinical characteristics and associated blood biomarkers. However, the strong correlation between identified biomarkers and ARDS subphenotypes has yet to establish etiology; hence, there is a need for the adoption of other methodologies for studying ARDS. In this review, we will shed light on ARDS metabolomics research in the literature and discuss advances and major obstacles encountered in ARDS metabolomics research. Generally, the ARDS metabolomics studies focused on identification of differentiating metabolites for diagnosing ARDS, but they were performed to different standards in terms of sample size, selection of control cohort, type of specimens collected, and measuring technique utilized. Virtually none of these studies have been properly validated to identify true metabolomics biomarkers of ARDS. Though in their infancy, metabolomics studies exhibit promise to unfold the biological processes underlying ARDS and, in our opinion, have great potential for pushing forward our present understanding of ARDS.","Metwaly, Sayed; Cote, Andreanne; Donnelly, Sarah J.; Banoei, Mohammad M.; Mourad, Ahmed I.; Winston, Brent W.",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,371,17

One plausible conclusion drawn from the spread and impact of the pandemic is that the pace of health infrastructure development in sub-Saharan Africa has lagged behind its population and economic growth posted in the last decade (2003–2013). An exhaustive audit of health infrastructure and remedial measures is, therefore, critical in navigating Africa to sustainable growth and development in the next decade. For the next charge of growth and development to not only be robust but also more sustainable and resilient to major emergencies (such as Ebola), there is a need to edify the state of healthcare across the continent to ensure the optimisation of the human resource and to redress the gap aggravated by loss of human-hours due to poor health.","Gatwiri, Kathomi; Amboko, Julians; Okolla, Darius",Soc Theory Health,371,1

At doses of 100 mg/kg and above, isatin is neuroprotective in different experimental models of neurodegeneration. Good evidence exists that its effects are realized via interaction with numerous isatin-binding proteins identified in the brain and peripheral tissues studied. In this study, we investigated the effect of a single dose administration of isatin to mice (100 mg/kg, 24 h) on differentially expressed proteins and a profile of the isatin-binding proteins in brain hemispheres. Isatin administration to mice caused downregulation of 31 proteins. However, these changes cannot be attributed to altered expression of corresponding genes. Although at this time point isatin influenced the expression of more than 850 genes in brain hemispheres (including 433 upregulated and 418 downregulated genes), none of them could account for the changes in the differentially expressed proteins. Comparative proteomic analysis of brain isatin-binding proteins of control and isatin-treated mice revealed representative groups of proteins sensitive to isatin administration. Control-specific proteins (n = 55) represent specific targets that interact directly with isatin. Appearance of brain isatin-binding proteins specific to isatin-treated mice (n = 94) may be attributed to the formation of new clusters of protein–protein interactions and/or novel binding sites induced by a high concentration of this regulator (ligand-induced binding sites). Thus, isatin administration produces multiple effects in the brain, which include changes in gene expression and also profiles of isatin-binding proteins and their interactomes. Further studies are needed for deeper insight into the mechanisms of the multilevel changes in the brain proteome induced by isatin. In the context of the neuroprotective action, these changes may be aimed at interruption of pathological links that begin to form after initiation of pathological processes.","Medvedev, Alexei; Kopylov, Arthur; Buneeva, Olga; Kurbatov, Leonid; Tikhonova, Olga; Ivanov, Alexis; Zgoda, Victor",Int J Mol Sci,371,1

Beside incorrect lifestyles, such as smoking or excessive consumption of red meat and alcohol, inflammatory bowel diseases are considered driving factors for colorectal cancer onset and development. It is known that chronic inflammatory processes can lead to both intestinal barrier disruption and perturbation of microbial flora, thus increasing cancer risk. To date, no treatment against these inflammatory pathologies has proved efficient and resolutive. The glycoprotein lactoferrin, a safe supplement for infant and adult foods, is involved in immune defense and endowed with a number of properties, including anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. This review outlines the most recent studies on lactoferrin as a potential candidate in the prevention and treatment of intestinal inflammatory pathologies that are associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer. ABSTRACT: The connection between inflammation and cancer is well-established and supported by genetic, pharmacological and epidemiological data. The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, have been described as important promoters for colorectal cancer development. Risk factors include environmental and food-borne mutagens, dysbalance of intestinal microbiome composition and chronic intestinal inflammation, with loss of intestinal epithelial barrier and enhanced cell proliferation rate. Therapies aimed at shutting down mucosal inflammatory response represent the foundation for IBDs treatment. However, when applied for long periods, they can alter the immune system and promote microbiome dysbiosis and carcinogenesis. Therefore, it is imperative to find new safe substances acting as both potent anti-inflammatory and anti-pathogen agents. Lactoferrin (Lf), an iron-binding glycoprotein essential in innate immunity, is generally recognized as safe and used as food supplement due to its multifunctionality. Lf possesses a wide range of immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties against different aseptic and septic inflammatory pathologies, including IBDs. Moreover, Lf exerts anti-adhesive, anti-invasive and anti-survival activities against several microbial pathogens that colonize intestinal mucosa of IBDs patients. This review focuses on those activities of Lf potentially useful for the prevention/treatment of intestinal inflammatory pathologies associated with colorectal cancer development.","Cutone, Antimo; Ianiro, Giusi; Lepanto, Maria Stefania; Rosa, Luigi; Valenti, Piera; Bonaccorsi di Patti, Maria Carmela; Musci, Giovanni",Cancers (Basel),371,1

New World (NW) mammarenaviruses constitute a diverse group of rodent-borne pathogens that includes several causative agents of severe viral hemorrhagic fever in humans. The ability of the NW mammarenaviral attachment glycoprotein (GP) to utilize human transferrin receptor 1 (hTfR1) as a primary entry receptor plays a key role in dictating zoonotic potential. The recent isolation of Tacaribe and lymphocytic choriominingitis mammarenaviruses from host-seeking ticks provided evidence for the presence of mammarenaviruses in arthropods, which are established vectors for numerous other viral pathogens. Here, using next generation sequencing to search for other mammarenaviruses in ticks, we identified a novel replication-competent strain of the NW mammarenavirus Tamiami (TAMV-FL), which we found capable of utilizing hTfR1 to enter mammalian cells. During isolation through serial passaging in mammalian immunocompetent cells, the quasispecies of TAMV-FL acquired and enriched mutations leading to the amino acid changes N151K and D156N, within GP. Cell entry studies revealed that both substitutions, N151K and D156N, increased dependence of the virus on hTfR1 and binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Moreover, we show that the substituted residues likely map to the sterically constrained trimeric axis of GP, and facilitate viral fusion at a lower pH, resulting in viral egress from later endosomal compartments. In summary, we identify and characterize a naturally occurring TAMV strain (TAMV-FL) within ticks that is able to utilize hTfR1. The TAMV-FL significantly diverged from previous TAMV isolates, demonstrating that TAMV quasispecies exhibit striking genetic plasticity that may facilitate zoonotic spillover and rapid adaptation to new hosts.","Moreno, Hector; Rastrojo, Alberto; Pryce, Rhys; Fedeli, Chiara; Zimmer, Gert; Bowden, Thomas A.; Gerold, Gisa; Kunz, Stefan",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,371,1

These vesicles play an important role in intercellular communication and influence the extracellular environment and the immune system. Emerging evidence demonstrates that cancer-derived exosomes are enriched in immunosuppressive proteins, such as the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). PD-L1 and its receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) are the key immune checkpoint molecules that promote tumor progression via negative regulation of immune responses. PDL-1 is highly expressed on the surface of tumor cells and binds to PD-1 on the surface of activated T cells, leading to suppression of T cells, which consequently enables cancer cells to escape antitumor immunity. Currently, there are several Food and Drug Administration-approved monoclonal antibodies blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, which are clinically used for cancer treatment. However, despite impressive treatment outcomes, some patients show poor response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Of note, tumor-derived exosomes containing PD-L1 can recapitulate the effect of cell-surface PD-L1. There is evidence that reveals a significant association between levels of circulating exosomal PD-L1 and rate of response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy. The present article reviews the role of exosomal PDL-1 in the therapeutic resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Importantly, it is suggested that the removal of exosomal PDL-1 could serve as a therapeutic adjuvant for enhancing the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in patients with cancer.","Yin, Zi; Yu, Min; Ma, Tingting; Zhang, Chuanzhao; Huang, Shanzhou; Karimzadeh, Mohammad Reza; Momtazi-Borojeni, Amir Abaas; Chen, Sheng",J Immunother Cancer,371,33

METHODS: The expression of HCMV and IFITM3 was detected with immunohistochemical staining, in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence double staining. The genotype of IFITM3 rs12252 was detected using the Sanger sequencing method. A genetic association analysis was carried out for this SNP and HCMV antigen expression. The relationship between this SNP and the clinical characteristics of these patients was further analyzed. In in vitro study, HCMV replication in SH‐SY5Y cells with overexpressed IFITM3 variant was detected by immunofluorescence and real‐time RT‐PCR. RESULTS: Elevated expression of HCMV and IFITM3 was observed in the brain tissue of RE patients. Moreover, the IFITM3 polymorphism rs12252‐C was found to associate with HCMV high detection and rapid disease progression in RE patients with the IFITM3 rs12252‐CC genotype. In vitro study showed the overexpressed IFITM3 variant was associated with HCMV high infection level. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the IFITM3 rs12252‐C is associated with the disease progression of RE patients via facilitating persistent HCMV infection in brain tissue and provides new insight into understanding the pathogenesis of RE.","Wang, Yi‐Song; Luo, Qiao‐Li; Guan, Yu‐Guang; Fan, Dong‐Ying; Luan, Guo‐Ming; Jing, An",Ann Clin Transl Neurol,371,1

Despite many developments in therapeutic approaches for affected individuals, the rate of morbidity and mortality is high. The survival rate and life quality of cancer patients is still low. In addition, the poor prognosis of patients and side effects of the present treatments underscores that finding novel and effective complementary and alternative therapies is a critical issue. Melatonin is a powerful anticancer agent and its efficiency has been widely documented up to now. Melatonin applies its anticancer abilities through affecting various mechanisms including angiogenesis, apoptosis, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress. Regarding the implication of mentioned cellular processes in cancer pathogenesis, we aimed to further evaluate the anticancer effects of melatonin via these mechanisms.","Mehrzadi, Saeed; Pourhanifeh, Mohammad Hossein; Mirzaei, Alireza; Moradian, Farid; Hosseinzadeh, Azam",Cancer Cell Int,371,1

In total, 12 well-trained male cyclists and triathletes (VO(2max) = 65.7 ± 8.7 mL·kg(−1)·min(−1)) completed five cycling tests including graded exercises tests (GXT) at different cadences (70–100 revolutions per minute, rpm), workloads (100–650 Watts, W), pedaling positions (seated and standing), vibration stress (20–40 Hz), and an 8-s maximal sprint. Tests were completed using a calibrated direct drive indoor trainer for the standing, seated, and vibration GXTs, and a friction belt cycle ergometer for the high-workload step protocol. Power output (PO) and cadence were collected from three different brand, new pedal units against the gold-standard SRM crankset. The three units of the Assioma Favero exhibited very high within-test reliability and an extremely high agreement between 100 and 250 W, compared to the gold standard (Standard Error of Measurement, SEM from 2.3–6.4 W). Greater PO produced a significant underestimating trend (p < 0.05, Effect size, ES ≥ 0.22), with pedals showing systematically lower PO than SRM (1–3%) but producing low bias for all GXT tests and conditions (1.5–7.4 W). Furthermore, vibrations ≥ 30 Hz significantly increased the differences up to 4% (p < 0.05, ES ≥ 0.24), whereas peak and mean PO differed importantly between devices during the sprints (p < 0.03, ES ≥ 0.39). These results demonstrate that the Assioma Favero power meter pedals provide trustworthy PO readings from 100 to 650 W, in either seated or standing positions, with vibrations between 20 and 40 Hz at cadences of 70, 85, and 100 rpm, or even at a free chosen cadence.","Rodríguez-Rielves, Víctor; Lillo-Beviá, José Ramón; Buendía-Romero, Ángel; Martínez-Cava, Alejandro; Hernández-Belmonte, Alejandro; Courel-Ibáñez, Javier; Pallarés, Jesús G.",Sensors (Basel),371,5

A series of 2-phenylacrylonitriles targeting AhR has been developed that have shown promising and selective activity against cancerous cell lines while sparing normal non-cancerous cells. A quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) modeling approach was pursued in order to generate a predictive model for cytotoxicity to support ongoing synthetic activities and provide important structure-activity information for new structure design. Recent work conducted by us has identified a number of compounds that exhibited false positive cytotoxicity values in the standard MTT assay. This work describes a good quality model that not only predicts the activity of compounds in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, but was also able to identify structures that subsequently gave false positive values in the MTT assay by identifying compounds with aberrant biological behavior.

While cancer family history information is used in primary care settings to identify unaffected patients who could benefit from a cancer genetics evaluation, this information is underutilized. System-level population health management strategies are needed to assist health care systems in identifying patients who may benefit from genetic services. In addition, because of the limited number of trained genetics specialists and increasing patient volume, the development of innovative and sustainable approaches to delivering cancer genetic services is essential. METHODS: We are conducting a randomized controlled trial, entitled Broadening the Reach, Impact, and Delivery of Genetic Services (BRIDGE), to address these needs. The trial is comparing uptake of genetic counseling, uptake of genetic testing, and patient adherence to management recommendations for automated, patient-directed versus enhanced standard of care cancer genetics services delivery models. An algorithm-based system that utilizes structured cancer family history data available in the electronic health record (EHR) is used to identify unaffected patients who receive primary care at the study sites and meet current guidelines for cancer genetic testing. We are enrolling eligible patients at two healthcare systems (University of Utah Health and New York University Langone Health) through outreach to a randomly selected sample of 2780 eligible patients in the two sites, with 1:1 randomization to the genetic services delivery arms within sites. Study outcomes are assessed through genetics clinic records, EHR, and two follow-up questionnaires at 4 weeks and 12 months after last genetic counseling contactpre-test genetic counseling. DISCUSSION: BRIDGE is being conducted in two healthcare systems with different clinical structures and patient populations. Innovative aspects of the trial include a randomized comparison of a chatbot-based genetic services delivery model to standard of care, as well as identification of at-risk individuals through a sustainable EHR-based system. The findings from the BRIDGE trial will advance the state of the science in identification of unaffected patients with inherited cancer susceptibility and delivery of genetic services to those patients.

Some clinical studies found that metformin, the first-line antidiabetic drug and the canonical AMPK activator, has therapeutic efficacy during treatment of early-stage PH. Other study findings suggest the use of metformin is preferentially beneficial for treatment of PH associated with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (PH-HFpEF). In this review, we discuss the “AMPK paradox” and highlight the differential effects of AMPK on pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary vascular remodeling.

Conservative therapy plays a key role in the treatment of SFTS. However, severe cases of SFTS, such as fulminant myocarditis, may require mechanical hemodynamic support. CASE PRESENTATION: This report presents a case of a 59-year old woman diagnosed with SFTS by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The patient had no initial symptoms of cardiac involvement and rapidly developed hemodynamic instability 3 days after hospitalization. She suffered from chest pain and had elevated cardiac enzymes. In the absence of atrio-ventricular conduction abnormalities, left ventricular dysfunction, and coronary artery abnormalities by coronary angiography, she was diagnosed with fulminant myocarditis. At that time, her pulse rate nearly dropped to 0 bpm and she developed near complete akinesia of the heart despite vasopressor administration. Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated with other supportive measures and she fully recovered after 21 days. CONCLUSIONS: This case indicates that SFTS can cause fulminant myocarditis even without evidence of cardiac involvement at presentation. When symptoms and/or signs of acute heart failure develop in patients with SFTS, myocarditis should be suspected and the patient should be promptly evaluated. Additionally, mechanical hemodynamic support like ECMO can be a lifesaving tool in the treatment of fulminant myocarditis.

Because adolescents commonly return to school settings following hospital discharge, school-related stressors and supports are important considerations for psychiatric treatment and discharge planning. The current study aimed to inform recommendations provided by hospitals to schools to improve school reintegration practices by employing a concurrent, mixed-methods design. Specifically, we: (1) surveyed school professionals (n = 133) in schools varying in resource availability and populations in one southeastern state of the United States about supports and services provided to returning students; and (2) conducted in-depth interviews with a subset of these professionals (n = 19) regarding their perceptions of the hospital to school transition for youth recovering from suicide-related crises. Findings from survey responses indicated that, compared to schools located in urban and suburban areas, schools in rural areas were less likely to have school reintegration protocols for returning students. More generally, however, available interventions and modifications were relatively consistent across rural and urban/suburban schools, schools serving high and low poverty communities, and schools with predominantly white and predominantly ethnic and racial minoritized student bodies. Key themes across interviews signify the importance of communication between stakeholders, the type of information used to develop re-entry plans, available school-based services for returning youth, and the need to mitigate stigma associated with mental health crises. Findings inform recommendations that can be provided by hospitals to schools to support adolescent recovery as they return to school following psychiatric hospitalization.

There are two key contributions. First, a new light is shed on the properties of frequently used naive method (in which unlabelled examples are treated as negative). In particular we show that naive method is related to incorrect specification of the logistic model and consequently the parameters in naive method are shrunk towards zero. An interesting relationship between shrinkage parameter and label frequency is established. Second, we introduce a novel method of fitting logistic model based on simultaneous estimation of vector of coefficients and label frequency. Importantly, the proposed method does not require prior estimation, which is a major obstacle in positive unlabelled learning. The method is superior in predicting posterior probability to both naive method and weighted likelihood method for several benchmark data sets. Moreover, it yields consistently better estimator of label frequency than other two known methods. We also introduce simple but powerful representation of positive and unlabelled data under Selected Completely at Random assumption which yields straightforwardly most properties of such model.","Teisseyre, Paweł; Mielniczuk, Jan; Łazęcka, Małgorzata",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,371,7

DESIGN: A four-compartment model was constructed for SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the Wuhan data and validated with data collected in Italy, the UK, and the US. The model captures the effectiveness of various disease suppression measures in three modifiable factors: (a) the per capita contact rate (β) that can be lowered by means of social distancing, (b) infection probability upon contacting infectious individuals that can be lowered by wearing facemasks, personal hygiene, etc., and (c) the population of infectious individuals in contact with the susceptible population, which can be lowered by quarantine. The model was used to make projections on the best approach to exit from the current lockdown. RESULTS: The model was applied to evaluate the epidemiological data and hospital burden in Italy, the UK, and the US. The control measures were identified as the key drivers for the observed epidemiological data through sensitivity analyses. Analysing the different lockdown exit strategies showed that a lockdown exit strategy with a combination of social separation/general facemask use may work, but this needs to be supported by intense monitoring which would allow re-introduction/tightening of the control measures if the number of new infected subjects increases again. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Governments should act early in a swift and decisive manner for containment policies.

Different kinds of testbeds are typically used to systematically execute attacks and evaluate defenses. Testbeds are widely used to demonstrate Building Automation and Control System (BACS) attacks and defenses, considered too risky to be executed on real infrastructures. However, those testbeds implement arbitrary configurations of building services that do not resemble real-world deployments. In this work, we present the first BACS testbed specially designed to assess the impact of cyberattacks from the victim’s perspective. It features general purpose building services such as illumination, ventilation, and temperature control, whose configuration is easily adapted to emulate the requirements of real-world locations. In this way, the context added to our testbed allows us to better understand the impact of BACS attacks through concrete and realistic scenarios. Moreover, by analyzing different configurations of the BACS (i.e., contexts), we found out that identical attacks may have dramatically different impacts. Thus, reinforcing our view on the relevance of adding context to BACS testbeds.","Esquivel-Vargas, Herson; Caselli, Marco; Laanstra, Geert Jan; Peter, Andreas","Detection of Intrusions and Malware, and Vulnerability Assessment",371,1

However, the accompanying adverse events, the most common of which is cytokine release syndrome (CRS), substantially limit its wide application. Due to its unique physiological characteristics, CRS in CAR T-cell treatment for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) may exhibit some special features. Although existing guidelines had greatly promoted the recognition and management of CRS, many recommendations are not fully applicable to B-NHL. Therefore, it is imperative to identify responses that are specific to CRS observed following CAR T treatment for B-NHL. Based on underlying biological processes and known pathophysiological mechanisms, we tentatively propose a new model to illustrate the occurrence and evolution of CAR T-cell-therapy-related CRS in B-NHL. In this model, tumour burden and bone marrow suppression are considered determinants of CRS. Novel phenomena after CAR T-cell infusion (such as local inflammatory response) are further identified. The proposed model will help us better understand the basic biology of CRS and recognize and manage it more rationally.","Wei, Jianshu; Liu, Yang; Wang, Chunmeng; Zhang, Yajing; Tong, Chuan; Dai, Guanghai; Wang, Wei; Rasko, John E.

Prior to this, our general surgical pathology (SP) and cytopathology (CP) services held daily consensus conferences (CC) at a multi-headed microscope. Implementing social distancing meant only a few faculty were present onsite and avoidance of interactions at the multi-headed scope. In an effort to preserve QA through CC, faculty exploited the use of web conferencing through our HIPAA-compliant Zoom. We describe the utility of this new practice. METHODS: From 3/25-4/30/20, all SP and CP cases selected for CC were presented by respective pathologists (n=8) in their own offices by using individual microscopes with cameras, image acquisition software, and screen-sharing through Zoom. One pathologist was responsible for sending out a new CC Zoom link daily and recording the consensus diagnosis. All onsite pathologists and those at home participated. RESULTS: We presented 95 SP and 31 CP cases through Zoom compared to 300 SP and 60 CP cases presented at a similar timeframe prior to social distancing. This 68% and 48% decline could be attributed to elective procedure cancellation. We assigned a consensus diagnosis to all cases, with 77% overall being malignant diagnoses, and breast being the most common SP specimen type (22%). Additionally, all participating pathologists felt comfortable with the new format irrespective of being onsite or at home. Apart from minor audio issues, we did not notice significant lag time or visual disturbances that interfered with diagnostic abilities. Importantly, the transition did not involve investing in new technology. CONCLUSION: The new virtual CC allowed our department to maintain QA practices in AP without sacrificing quality and serves as a starting point to investigating the use of this technology to other applications in AP, such as overnight frozen sections.","Arriola, A; Aneja, A; Rong, Y; Taraif, S; jhala, N",Am J Clin Pathol,371,14

In addition, nursing home residents have been one of the most heavily affected populations during this pandemic. Due to insurance reasons, patients requiring outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) may be discharged to a post-acute care facility (PACF) for the sole purpose of receiving intravenous antibiotics, placing these patients at higher risk of COVID-19 infection. This study evaluated hospital readmissions due to COVID-19 in OPAT patients. METHODS: Adult patients who received OPAT between March 16 and May 31, 2020 were included. Patients were identified via an OPAT database and reason for readmission was reviewed via the electronic medical record. Patients with ongoing courses of OPAT as of May 31, 2020 were excluded. The primary outcome was readmission due to COVID while receiving OPAT. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: During the study period, 266 OPAT patients were identified, with 88 (31%) patients discharged to PACFs. There were 49 (18%) total readmissions, with 3 (6%) readmitted due to COVID-19. All 3 patients were readmitted from unique PACFs. This resulted in 3/16 (19%) readmissions due to COVID-19 in patients discharged to PACFs as compared to none for OPAT patients discharged to home. CONCLUSION: Patients discharged to PACFs are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Efforts should be made to increase availability of home OPAT services for patients who have no need for skilled care other than intravenous antimicrobials.

AIM: The goal is to evaluate the current status of digitization in outpatient diabetes clinics in Germany based on surveys and personal interviews. In addition to the question of the status of digitization in clinical practice, the question arises as to what factors are considered part of digitization in an outpatient diabetes clinic. Finally, possibilities for digitalization and its use in a diabetes clinic in 2030 will be pointed out. CONCLUSION: Digitalization changes the workflow and the possibilities for diabetes clinics. Due to the obvious advantages and the expectations of patients, digitization can no longer be stopped.

It is a useful method for evaluating the performance of optical sensors onboard satellites orbiting the Earth. Lunar calibration provides sufficient radiometric calibration opportunities without requiring any special equipment, and is suitable for nano/microsatellites. This study applies lunar calibration to a multispectral sensor, Ocean Observation Camera (OOC), on board a microsatellite named Rapid International Scientific Experiment Satellite. Simulating the brightness of the Moon based on the RObotic Lunar Observatory and SELENE/Spectrum Profiler models, sensitivity degradation was proven to be negligible in any of the four spectral bands of the OOC with the sensor temperature correction. A bluing trend in the OOC’s sensor sensitivity was revealed, indicating a shorter observation wavelength shows larger irradiance. Comparing the top-of-atmosphere reflectance of Railroad Valley Playa with the Radiometric Calibration Network dataset revealed that the derived calibration parameter from the lunar calibration was valid for correcting the bluing trend in the visible range. Although the lunar and vicarious calibration parameters for the infrared band were unexpectedly inconsistent, lunar calibration could potentially contribute toward estimating the contaminated background radiance in the Earth observation images.","Imai, Masataka; Kurihara, Junichi; Kouyama, Toru; Kuwahara, Toshinori; Fujita, Shinya; Sakamoto, Yuji; Sato, Yuji; Saitoh, Sei-Ichi; Hirata, Takafumi; Yamamoto, Hirokazu; Takahashi, Yukihiro",Sensors (Basel),371,6

We, therefore, aimed to demonstrate the diagnostic accuracy of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for the identification of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) in clinically suspected patients. Methods: Until November 23, 2020, databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science were scanned for eligible studies. A bivariate random-effects model was used for meta-analysis of the 33 included studies obtained from 1606 citations, and pooled summary estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were generated. Results: Twenty-three studies (n = 8,547) assessed NAAT accuracy for MSSA detection, while three studies (n = 479) evaluated MRSA detection in adults. The pooled NAAT sensitivity and specificity for MRSA in adults was higher [sensitivity: 0.83 (95% CI 0.59–0.96), specificity: 0.99 (95% CI 0.98–1.0)] as compared to MSSA [sensitivity: 0.76 (95% CI 0.69–0.82), specificity: 0.98 (95% CI 0.98–0.99)]. Similarly, eight studies (n = 4,089) investigating MSSA in pediatric population reported higher NAAT accuracy [sensitivity: 0.89 (95% CI 0.76–0.96), specificity: 0.98 (95% CI 0.97–0.98)] compared to adults. Among NAA tests, SeptiFast (real-time PCR, commercial) was frequently applied, and its diagnostic accuracy corresponded well to the overall summary estimates. A meta-regression and subgroup analysis of study design, sample condition, and patient selection method could not explain the heterogeneity (P > 0.05) in the diagnostic efficiency. Conclusions: NAAT could be applied as the preferred initial tests for timely diagnosis and BSI management.","Chen, Ke; Malik, Aijaz Ahmad; Sheng, Yun-Jian; Ahmed, Sarfraz; Sun, Changfeng; Deng, Cun-Liang; Ojha, Suvash Chandra",Front Pediatr,371,1

Additionally, several breast milk factors have been implicated in immune-related health outcomes later in life, including immunoglobulins, cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and, more recently, non-coding RNA (ncRNA) species. In this systematic review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the current literature on endogenous ncRNAs found in human breast milk. Thirty (30) relevant studies were identified and, whilst the majority studies focused on microRNAs (miRNAs), there is evidence that breast milk contains high quantities of RNA which also include long-coding RNAs, circular RNAs, as well as other short RNAs and fragmented tRNA and rRNAs. Among studies investigating miRNAs, miR-148a-3p, miR-30a/d-5p, miR-22-3p, miR-146b-5p, miR-200a/c-3p, and the 5p end of the let-7 miRNAs were commonly reported among the top 10 miRNAs in the cell, lipid, and skim milk fractions of breast milk. Methodological difference and small sample sizes limit the possibility of conclusively identifying which maternal and infant characteristics affect the miRNA profile. The highly expressed miRNAs were generally reported to be similar across lactational stage, milk fraction, maternal and infant characteristics, or infant growth and health. All the same, individual studies identify potential differences in miRNA expression levels which should be confirmed by future studies. Stability, uptake, and physiological functions of miRNAs were also considered in several studies. Breast milk miRNAs are relatively resistant to a range of harsh conditions and uptake experiments suggest that extracellular vesicles containing miRNAs and circular RNAs can be taken up by intestinal epithelial cells. Although the evidence regarding the functional effect of breast milk miRNAs is limited, the predicted functions range from metabolic and biosynthetic processes to signaling pathways, cellular adhesion, communication, growth, and differentiation. Finally, this systematic review highlights some of the methodological challenges and knowledge gaps which can help direct future research in this field. In particular, it is important to further investigate the bioavailability of miRNAs in different milk fractions, and to characterize other ncRNAs which are largely unstudied.

Early diagnosis of OA-associated cartilage alterations would be beneficial for disease prevention and control, and for the development of disease-modifying treatments. However, early diagnosis is still hampered by a lack of quantifiable readouts in preclinical models. DESIGN In this study, we have shown the potency of contrast-enhanced nanofocus x-ray computed tomography (CE-nanoCT) to be used for virtual 3-dimensional (3D) histopathology in established mouse models for OA, and we compared with standard histopathology. RESULTS We showed the equivalence of CE-nanoCT images to histopathology for the modified Mankin scoring of the cartilage structure and quality. Additionally, a limited set of 3D cartilage characteristics measured by CE-nanoCT image analysis in a user-independent and semiautomatic manner, that is, average and maximum of the noncalcified cartilage thickness distribution and loss in glycosaminoglycans, was shown to be predictive for the cartilage quality and structure as can be evaluated by histopathological scoring through the use of an empirical model. CONCLUSIONS We have shown that CE-nanoCT is a tool that allows virtual histopathology and 3D morphological quantification of multitissue systems, such as the chondro-osseous junction. It provides faster and more quantitative data on cartilage structure and quality compared with standard histopathology while eliminating user bias. CE-nanoCT thus should allow capturing subtle differences in cartilage characteristics, carefully mapping OA progression and, ultimately, asses the beneficial changes when testing a candidate disease-modifying treatment.","Kerckhofs, Greet; Sainz, Julie; Maréchal, Marina; Wevers, Martine; Van de Putte, Tom; Geris, Liesbet; Schrooten, Jan",Cartilage,371,24

Till now there is no effective drug or vaccine against this virus that can make complete cure; however, a number of drugs are in trials. OBJECTIVES In this review, we have focused on an alternative therapeutic approach using natural products utilizing host anti-viral responses for resolving COVID-19 pathogenesis. METHODS We have searched databases like PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar for articles related to natural products and viral diseases, with a specific focus on coronaviruses, as well as other RNA viruses and recent updates on COVID-19 pandemic, and collected articles and reviewed comprehensively. RESULTS Scientific studies clarified the viral pathogenesis that involved viral entrance into host cells, and antiviral response inside the cells, which can be effectively targeted by numerous natural compounds from different sources. Many of these compounds can potentially target viral genomic material or protein machinery. Natural products which were found effective against other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV (which emerged in 2002 and 2012, respectively) might be effective against SARS-CoV-2 due to their structural similarities; however, it needs time to establish the clinical success of these drugs. CONCLUSION COVID-19 pandemic is a global emergency problem and urgent drug development is necessary. Natural products can be the biggest source of drugs, as they have been found effective in other coronaviruses previously; however, it needs time to establish these drugs for clinical application.","Shawon, Jakaria; Akter, Zakia; Hossen, Md Munnaf; Akter, Yeasmin; Sayeed, Abu; Junaid, Md; Afrose, Syeda Samira; Khan, Md Asaduzzaman",Current pharmaceutical design,371,16

A registry study.,16.851093,7.663496,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE We evaluated temporal trends in stroke incidence between men and women to determine whether changes in the distribution of vascular risk factors have influenced sex differences in stroke epidemiology. METHODS Patients with first-ever stroke including ischemic stroke, spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and undetermined stroke between 1987 and 2012 were identified through the population-based registry of Dijon, France. Incidence rates were calculated for age groups, sex, and stroke subtypes. Sex differences and temporal trends (according to 5-year time periods) were evaluated by calculating incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with Poisson regression. RESULTS Four thousand six hundred and fourteen patients with a first-ever stroke (53.1% women) were recorded. Incidence was lower in women than in men (112 versus 166 per 100 000/y; IRR, 0.68; P<0.001), especially in age group 45 to 84 years, and for both ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage. From 1987 to 2012, the lower incidence of overall stroke in women was stable (IRR ranging between 0.63 and 0.72 according to study periods). When considering stroke subtype, a slight increase in the incidence of ischemic stroke was observed in both men (IRR, 1.011; 95% confidence interval, 1.005-1.016; P=0.001) and women (IRR, 1.013; 95% confidence interval, 1.007-1.018; P=0.001). The sex gap in incidence remained unchanged in ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage. Conversely, the lower subarachnoid hemorrhage incidence in women vanished with time because of an increasing incidence. CONCLUSIONS The sex gap in stroke incidence did not change with time except for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Despite lower rates, more women than men experience an incident stroke each year because of a longer life expectancy.","Giroud, Marie; Delpont, Benoit; Daubail, Benoit; Blanc, Christelle; Durier, Jérôme; Giroud, Maurice; Béjot, Yannick",Stroke,371,1

In our method, the measured surface is marked by fluorescent nanobeads allowing a complete suppression of diffuse light by bandpass filtering. Light emitted by each fluorescent bead is shaped to a double-helix point spread function used for three-dimensional bead localization on the surface. This non-interferometric measurement of rough surface topography is implemented in a vibration resistant setup. The comparison of our method with vertical scanning interferometry shows that a commercial profiler is surpassed when ground glass surfaces with steep slopes are measured.","Schovánek, Petr; Bouchal, Petr; Bouchal, Zdeněk",Optics letters,371,1

Methods- We used data from PROSCIS-B (Prospective Cohort With Incident Stroke Berlin). Cognitive function was assessed by Mini-Mental-State-Examination at baseline, and Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified after 1 to 3 years of follow-up. Patients were categorized according to hs-cTnT quartiles. We performed generalized linear regression to calculate risk ratios of cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental-State-Examination<27; Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified <32). Association of hs-cTnT with cognitive function over time was estimated using a linear mixed model. Results- We included 555 patients (mean age, 67 years, 62% male, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 2 [interquartile range, 1-5], hs-cTnT above upper reference limit 40%, baseline cognitive impairment 28%). Baseline Mini-Mental-State-Examination score and rate of cognitive impairment were lower in patients in the highest versus lowest hs-cTnT quartile (median Mini-Mental-State-Examination 27 versus 29, and 15.3% versus 43.0%, adjusted risk ratio, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.07-2.90], respectively). If anything, cognition seemed to improve in all groups, yet Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified scores were consistently lower in patients within the highest versus lowest hs-cTnT quartile (adjusted β, -1.33 [95% CI, -2.65 to -0.02]), without difference in the rate of change over time. Conclusions- In patients with mild-to-moderate first-ever ischemic stroke without dementia, higher hs-cTnT was associated with higher prevalence of cognitive impairment at baseline and lower Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-modified during 3-year follow-up.

Reduced cerebral oxygenation has been associated with brain injury. Preterm small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonates show higher cerebral oxygenation than AGA peers throughout the first postnatal days. To date, no studies have investigated the effect of hsPDA on cerebral oxygenation in preterm SGA neonates. OBJECTIVE We aimed to assess the effect of hsPDA on cerebral oxygenation in preterm SGA neonates compared to AGA peers. We hypothesised that higher baseline cerebral oxygenation would reduce the impact of hsPDA on cerebral oxygenation in preterm SGA neonates. METHODS We monitored regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) with near-infrared spectroscopy and calculated the cerebral fractional tissue oxygen extraction (cFTOE) for 72 h after birth. Retrospective analysis compared 36 preterm SGA neonates (birth weight <10th percentile, 18 with hsPDA) to 36 preterm AGA neonates (birth weight 20th to 80th percentile, 18 with hsPDA). RESULTS In contrast to the other groups, SGA-hsPDA neonates demonstrated a significant fall in rScO2 [69% (SEM 2.5) at 4-8 h to 61% (2.7) at 68-72 h, p < 0.001] with a concurrent rise in cFTOE [0.26 (0.026) at 4-8 h to 0.34 (0.030) at 68-72 h, p < 0.001]. CONCLUSIONS Contrary to our hypothesis, hsPDA had a significant negative effect on cerebral oxygenation in preterm SGA neonates. Future studies should explore the potential benefits of early screening and treatment for hsPDA on long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm SGA neonates.","Cohen, Emily; Dix, Laura; Baerts, Willem; Alderliesten, Thomas; Lemmers, Petra; van Bel, Frank",Neonatology,371,7

No systematic review has examined their potential to reduce or prevent prescription opioid use or related harm, and/or pain intensity in opioid-using patients with chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP). Recognizing the importance of patient preferences in evidence-based practice, we also sought to assess patient interest in BPIs. METHODS A systematic review of studies published between 1980-2020 was conducted using five databases. Eligible treatment studies included patients ≥18 years old, with CNCP, and who were using prescription opioids. An adjunctive study independent of our review was also undertaken in 188 prescription opioid-using patients (77% female; Mage=49▒y) diagnosed with CNCP. Patients completed pain-related questionnaires online and indicated if they would consider BPI treatment options. RESULTS The review identified six studies. Given the heterogeneity across studies, a meta-analysis was not conducted. A narrative review found all of the six studies demonstrated some evidence for BPI effectiveness for reducing opioid use or related harms; these were assessed as having mostly low methodological quality. Mixed support for the effect on pain intensity was found in one study. Despite the inconclusive findings and heterogenous studies identified in the review, 92% of patients in our survey reported interest in receiving a BPI. DISCUSSION In combination, these findings highlight the inconsistency between patient demand and the availability of evidence for BPIs targeting opioid use, related harm and/or pain intensity. Future work should examine the effectiveness of BPIs in higher quality studies.","Elphinston, Rachel A; Sterling, Michele; Leung, Janni; Gray, Paul D; Requena, Simone Scotti; Connor, Jason P",The Clinical journal of pain,371,1

Collecting saliva is not invasive and is therefore easier, safer and cheaper than drawing blood. Saliva secretion itself is also a diagnostic parameter. A low saliva secretion rate may indicate an underlying disease such as Sjögren syndrome and is a risk factor for the occurrence of caries, dental erosion, Candida infections and is associated with upper respiratory tract infections in athletes. Unlike blood, saliva can be collected independently of qualified staff. Saliva can then be sent to laboratories where it can be screened for inherited diseases or virus infections like Covid-19. Tests for which saliva does not need to be sent away but can be processed on site, like pregnancy tests or HIV tests, which are already commercially available, are even easier.

We analyzed efficacy and safety of intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (IV GPI) plus subsequent intra-arterial thrombolysis with or without additional endovascular mechanical therapy (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/stenting or thrombus aspiration) and sought treatment factors that predict good clinical outcome. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 120 cases of patients with angiographically proven acute VBO. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors for clinical outcome and included level of consciousness, age, sex, time to angiography, GPI agent, admission mode, occlusion type, recanalization success, and endovascular treatment mode. Clinical follow-up was dichotomized in no to moderate disability (modified Rankin scale (mRS) 0-3) vs. severe disability or death (mRS 4-6). RESULTS Median National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score on admission was 32, and mean NIHSS score was 24. A total of 49 patients (41 %) developed no to moderate disability (mRS 0-3), and 39 patients (33 %) died. Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction 2/3 recanalization success was achieved in 97 patients (80.8 %). Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages occurred in 11 patients (9 %). Mild impairment of consciousness (p < 0.001) and embolic occlusion type (p = 0.01) were significant predictors of favorable outcome. Clinical outcome in recanalized patients was better, but not statistically significant (p = 0.055). CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that combined therapy with IV GPI and subsequent endovascular therapy may be a valid treatment strategy in acute VBO. With this treatment approach, a preserved vigilance before treatment and an embolic occlusion type are associated with no to moderate disability.","Ernst, M; Butscheid, F; Fiehler, J; Wittkugel, O; Alfke, K; Jansen, O; Petersen, D; Koch, C; Eckert, B",Clinical neuroradiology,371,1

Impaired pancreatic function may also result in increased gastric acidity, leading in turn to heartburn, peptic ulcers and the impairment of oral pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. The administration of gastric acid-reducing agents has been used as an adjunct to pancreatic enzyme therapy to improve absorption of fat and gastro-intestinal symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. It is important to establish the evidence regarding potential benefits of drugs that reduce gastric acidity in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. OBJECTIVES To assess the effect of drug therapies for reducing gastric acidity for: nutritional status; symptoms associated with increased gastric acidity; fat absorption; lung function; quality of life and survival; and to determine if any adverse effects are associated with their use. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals, abstract books and conference proceedings.Most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 12 May 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA All randomised and quasi-randomised trials involving agents that reduce gastric acidity compared to placebo or a comparator treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Both authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS The searches identified 39 trials; 17 of these, with 273 participants, were suitable for inclusion, but the number of trials assessing each of the different agents was small. Seven trials were limited to children and four trials enrolled only adults. Meta-analysis was not performed, 14 trials were of a cross-over design and we did not have the appropriate information to conduct comprehensive meta-analyses. All the trials were run in single centres and duration ranged from five days to six months. The included trials were generally not reported adequately enough to allow judgements on risk of bias.However, one trial found that drug therapies that reduce gastric acidity improved gastro-intestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain; seven trials reported significant improvement in measures of fat malabsorption; and two trials reported no significant improvement in nutritional status. Only one trial reported measures of respiratory function and one trial reported an adverse effect with prostaglandin E2 analogue misoprostol. No trials have been identified assessing the effectiveness of these agents in improving quality of life, the complications of increased gastric acidity, or survival. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Trials have shown limited evidence that agents that reduce gastric acidity are associated with improvement in gastro-intestinal symptoms and fat absorption. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to indicate whether there is an improvement in nutritional status, lung function, quality of life, or survival. Furthermore, due to the unclear risks of bias in the included trials, we are unable to make firm conclusions based on the evidence reported therein. We therefore recommend that large, multicentre, randomised controlled clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate these interventions.","Ng, Sze May; Moore, Helen S",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,371,28

Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) represents the latest advance in laparoscopic surgery. The aim of this systematic review was to establish the safety and complication profile of colonic SILS. METHODS The search was performed in October 2011 using PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Search terms were 'colorectal', 'colon', 'colectomy', 'rectal' and single incision/port/trocar/site/scar. Only pure single-incision laparoscopic colonic surgery for benign and malignant colonic disease was included. Primary outcomes were the early postoperative complication profiles of colonic SILS. Secondary outcomes were duration of operation, lymph node yields, conversion rate and duration of hospital stay. RESULTS Colonic SILS data were compared with data from a Cochrane review on the short-term outcomes of laparoscopic colonic surgery and four main RCTs on laparoscopic colonic surgery. Median operating times and time to first bowel motion for colonic SILS were comparable with those for laparoscopic colonic surgery. The median lymph node retrieval for malignant disease achieved with SILS was acceptable. Evidence for a reduction in postoperative pain with SILS was conflicting. There was no significant reduction in length of hospital stay with SILS. Most patients selected for colonic SILS had a low body mass index, non-bulky tumours and were operated on by experienced laparoscopic surgeons. There was significant heterogeneity in study group characteristics, indications for surgery, research methodology, operative techniques and follow-up time. CONCLUSION Colonic SILS should be restricted to highly selected patients; operations should be performed by experienced laparoscopic surgeons, with critical appraisal of clinical outcomes.","Fung, A K-Y; Aly, E H",The British journal of surgery,371,7

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the CT image data of COVID-19 patients diagnosed by nucleic acid test and CT examination in 57 patients in Zhuzhou Central Hospital and Zhuzhou First People's Hospital, and summarized the characteristics of CT imaging and the development of lesions. RESULTS Most of the cases were characterized by peripheral distribution of lesions. A total of 37 cases (64.91%) were purely peripherally distributed, 16 cases (28.07%) coexisted with peripheral and mid-internal distribution, and 4 cases (7.02%) had simple mid-inner band distribution. In peripherally distributed cases, the long axis of the lesion was mostly parallel to the pleura in 36 cases (63.16%). In the case of inner-middle zone distribution, the long axis of the lesion was mostly parallel and surrounded the bronchial vascular bundle, or distributed along the lung lobules (31.58%). All cases had ground-glass-density foci, 31 cases (54.38%) had fine grid shadows in the lesions, 46 cases (80.70%) had thick vascular shadows in the lesions, and 23 cases (40.35%) showed signs of bronchial inflation. Among the 10 cases of ""wrinkling shape"" lesions in the first CT examination, except for 1 case without reexamination, the remaining 9 cases had different degrees of absorption in the second CT examination. Among the 26 cases of ""wrinkling shape"" lesions in the second CT examination, except for 11 cases without reexamination, the other 15 patients had different degrees of absorption in the third CT examination. CONCLUSIONS The early CT manifestations of COVID-19 are mostly ground-glass-density foci distributed in the subpleural region, some of which are distributed near the bronchial blood vessel bundle and in the central area of the lobule. As the course of the disease progresses, there may be varying degrees of solid components in the lesion. When the lesions show a ""wrinkling shape"", it is often suggested that the lesions will evolve towards the direction of absorption. These characteristics are of great value in assisting clinical diagnosis and dynamically observing changes undersuch condition.","Li, Ming; Peng, Wanxiang; Chen, Miaomiao; Zhu, Qichao; Zou, Xia; Long, Xiaoli",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

A non-invasive treatment strategy avoiding mesh grafting is often chosen by practitioners based on their clinical and empirical evidence. However, a delayed re-epithelialization after conservative treatment may extend the patient's hospitalization period, increase the risk of infection, and lead to poor functional and aesthetic outcome. Early spray grafting, using non-cultured autologous cells, is under discussion for partial and deep partial-thickness wounds to accelerate the re-epithelialization process, reducing the healing time in the hospital, and minimizing complications. To address planning for future clinical studies on this technology, suitable indications will be interesting. We present case information on severe second-degree injuries after gas, chemical, electrical, gasoline, hot water, and tar scalding burns showing one patient per indication. The treatment results with autologous non-cultured cells, support rapid, uncomplicated re-epithelialization with aesthetically and functionally satisfying outcomes.

While published data about other highly infectious human COVs [that is, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)] provide helpful information about the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, there is limited understanding surrounding knowledge of ocular manifestation of the virus. This paper reviews published data which reveal the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in tears and conjunctival scrappings of some COVID-19 patients by real-time-polymerase chain reaction assay, although the detection rate is low compared to samples from respiratory sites. Nevertheless, the ocular complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection are uncommon. The evidence partly supports the eye as a portal of entry for SARS-CoV-2 to infect respiratory cells or viral shedding from respiratory cells via the nasolacrimal duct unto the ocular surface. The possibility of ocular secretions as source for SARS-CoV-2 to spread externally has substantial public health implications.","Ocansey, Stephen; Abu, Emmanuel Kwasi; Abraham, Carl Halladay; Owusu-Ansah, Andrew; Boadi-Kusi, Samuel Bert; Ilechie, Alex Azuka; Acheampong, Desmond Omane",Ocular immunology and inflammation,371,27

A cluster-randomized trial, with randomization at the level of the preschool, was run in 40 Jerusalem preschool classrooms. Eighty preschool educators participated. The program used a multipronged approach which included elements aimed at staff, children, parents, school nurses and the classroom environment. Frontal lectures by medical, epidemiological and educational experts, along with printed materials and experiential learning, were provided to staff. Responses from a validated survey instrument were used to build four scales for each respondent regarding beliefs, attitudes, self-efficacy and knowledge. The scales were built on a Likert-type 1-7 scale (1 = minimum, 7 = maximum). The effect of the intervention was tested using mixed model analysis of variance. Response was received from 92.5% of educators. Educators believed that handwashing could affect health (mean = 5.5, SD = 1.1), had high levels of self-efficacy (mean = 6.1, SD = 0.9) and had positive attitudes toward handwashing (mean = 5.7, SD = 1.2). Knowledge was affected by the intervention (intervention: mean = 6.2, SD = 0.7; control: mean = 5.8, SD = 0.8). The combination of positive attitudes toward handwashing among educators and the program's effectiveness in imparting knowledge helped to create a sustained social norm of handwashing among many children in disparate locations.","Rosen, L; Zucker, D; Brody, D; Engelhard, D; Manor, O",Health education research,371,11

We compare the outcomes between CA and AA patients undergoing minimally invasive partial nephrectomy (PN) at our high-volume center. Methods We identified 942 robotic and 38 laparoscopic PN cases between 2007-2017 (852 CA and 129 AA). We compared demographics and perioperative outcomes. We then estimated the overall and disease-specific survival. Results Age, BMI, operative time, EBL, nephrometry score, tumor size, CCI, length of stay, and gender were not statistically different. The mean preoperative GFR was higher in the AA cohort (91.4mL/min/1.73m2 vs 86.1mL/min/1.73m2,p=0.007); however, at 1-year there was no mean difference (76.8mL/min/1.73m2 vs 74.5mL/min/1.73m2,p=0.428). There was a higher percentage of Fuhrman Grade 3/4 in AA (33.3% vs 22.5%,p=0.044). The AA cohort had a 2.66x higher incidence of papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (34.9% vs 13.1%,p<0.001) and unclassified RCC (3.9% vs. 0.4%,p=0.001). There was no difference in tumor stage (p=0.260) or incidence of benign histology (15.3% vs 11.6%,p=0.278). There were no differences in thirty-day complications (p=0.330). There was no observed difference in overall survival (p=0.752) or disease-free survival (p=0.403) at 43.2 months. Conclusions For low stage renal cancer, there was no difference in CKD, overall and disease-free survival at a median follow up of 43.2 months, despite having higher grade tumors and a higher percentage of unclassified RCC in the AA cohort. AA had a higher incidence of papillary RCC. The equivalent survival could be due to the earlier discovery of lower stage renal masses incidentally identified on imaging studies performed equally for other reasons in both AA and CA patients.","Sands, Kenneth G; Bhatt, Rohit; Vetter, Joel; Paradis, Alethea; Chow, Alexander K; Bhayani, Sam; Figenshau, R Sherburne; Venkatesh, Ramakrishna J",Journal of endourology,371,1

This study analyzed the incidence, mechanism, and outcomes of intraoperative perforations during these procedures in a large institutional experience. METHODS All patients who underwent lap foregut surgery including laparoscopic antireflux surgery (LARS), paraesophageal hernia (PEH) repair, Heller myotomy, and reoperative hiatal hernia (redo HH) repair at the authors' institution from August 2004 to September 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. Perforation events and postoperative outcomes were analyzed, and complications were graded by the modified Clavien system. All data are expressed as means ± standard deviations or as medians. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS In this study, the repairs for 1,223 patients were analyzed (381 LARS procedures, 379 PEH repairs, 313 Heller myotomies, 150 redo HH repairs). Overall, 51 patients (4.2 %) had 56 perforations resulting from LARS (n = 4, 1 %), PEH repair (n = 7, 1.8 %), Heller myotomy (n = 18, 5.8 %), and redo HH repair (n = 22, 14.6 %). Redo HH was significantly more likely to result in perforations than LARS or PEH repair (p < 0.001). The locations of the perforations were esophageal in 13 patients (23.6 %), gastric in 40 patients (72.7 %), and indeterminate in 2 patients (3.6 %). The most common mechanisms of perforations were suture placement for LARS (75 %) and traction for PEH repair (43 %) and for Heller myotomy during the myotomy (72 %). The most redo HH perforations resulted from dissection/wrap takedown (73 %) and traction (14 %). Perforations were recognized and repaired intraoperatively in 43 cases (84 %) and postoperatively in eight cases (16 %). Perforations discovered postoperatively were more likely to require reoperation (75 vs 2 %; p < 0.001), to require more gastrointestinal and radiologic interventions (50 vs 2 %; p = 0.004), and to have higher morbidity (88 vs 26 %; p = 0.004) than perforations recognized intraoperatively. CONCLUSIONS In a high-volume center, intraoperative perforations are the most frequent with reoperative HH repair. If perforations are recognized and repaired intraoperatively, they require minimal postoperative intervention. Unrecognized perforations usually require reoperation and result in significantly greater morbidity.","Zhang, Linda P; Chang, Ronald; Matthews, Brent D; Awad, Michael; Meyers, Bryan; Eagon, J Chris; Brunt, L Michael",Surgical endoscopy,371,16

However, the pathogenic mechanism is still not fully understood. In the present study, we identified 1,631 upregulated and 1,515 downregulated genes and found that cell cycle and metabolism-related pathways or biological processes highly dysregulated in HCC. To assess the biological importance of these DEGs, we carried out weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify the functional modules potentially involved in HCC pathogenesis or progression. The five modules were detected with Dynamic Tree Cut algorithm, and GO enrichment analysis revealed that these modules exhibited different biological processes or signaling pathways, such as metabolism-related pathways, cell proliferation-related pathways, and molecules in tumor microenvironment. Moreover, we also observed two immune cells, namely, cytotoxic cells and macrophage enriched in modules grey and brown, respectively, while T helper cell-2 (Th2) was enriched in module turquoise. Among the WGCNA network, four hub long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified to be associated with HCC prognostic outcomes, suggesting that coexpression network analysis could uncover lncRNAs with functional importance, which may be associated with prognostic outcomes of HCC patients. In summary, this study demonstrated that network-based analysis could identify some functional modules and some hub-lncRNAs, which may be critical for HCC pathogenesis or progression.","Li, Jianguo; Zhou, Jin; Kai, Shuangshuang; Wang, Can; Wang, Daijun; Jiang, Jiying",BioMed research international,371,1

Therefore, we investigated the role of anxiety, depressive, and other mental disorders for levels and longitudinal changes of COVID-19-related fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. In a longitudinal observational design with four assessment waves from March, 27th until June, 15th 2020, a total of 6,551 adults from Germany was assessed. 4,175 individuals participated in one, 1,070 in two, 803 in three, and 503 in all four waves of data collection. Multilevel analyses revealed that across all assessment waves, COVID-19-related fear, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were significantly higher in individuals with vs. without anxiety, depressive, and other mental disorders. All symptoms decreased on average over time, and this decrease was significantly stronger in individuals with vs. without anxiety disorders, and particularly driven by individuals with generalized anxiety disorder. Our findings suggest that individuals with mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders - and in particular those with a generalized anxiety disorder - seem to be vulnerable to experience psychological strain in the context of the pandemic, might likely overestimate potential threat, and should be targeted by preventive and therapeutic interventions.","Bendau, Antonia; Kunas, Stefanie Lydia; Wyka, Sarah; Petzold, Moritz Bruno; Plag, Jens; Asselmann, Eva; Ströhle, Andreas",Journal of anxiety disorders,371,1

The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) reflects systemic inflammation, which plays an important role in the process of treating ischemic stroke. This study aims to explore the relationship between NLR and the clinical outcomes of LVOS patients undergoing EVT. METHODS Patients were selected from the EVT for acUte Anterior circuLation (ACTUAL) ischemic stroke registry. The laboratory data (neutrophil count, lymphocyte count) before EVT were collected. Poor functional outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 3-6 at 3 months. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the relationship of NLR with functional outcome, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and mortality. RESULTS We eventually included 616 patients (median of age, 66 years; 40.3% female). There were 350 (56.7%) patients achieving mRS of 3-6 at 3 months, 98 (15.9%) patients with sICH, and the mortality at 3 months was 24.8% (153/616). Baseline NLR was independently associated with poor functional outcome (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.02-2.45; p = 0.039) and sICH (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.09-3.11; p = 0.023) but showed a trend for predicting 3-month mortality (OR 1.57; 95% CI 0.94-2.65; p = 0.088). CONCLUSIONS NLR independently predicts 3-month functional outcome and sICH but the existence of a trend association with mortality after EVT for acute anterior circulation LVOS patients.","Duan, Zhenhui; Wang, Huaiming; Wang, Zhen; Hao, Yonggang; Zi, Wenjie; Yang, Dong; Zhou, Zhiming; Liu, Wenhua; Lin, Min; Shi, Zhonghua; Lv, Penghua; Wan, Yue; Xu, Gelin; Xiong, Yunyun; Zhu, Wusheng; Liu, Xinfeng",Cerebrovascular diseases,371,8

We report functional and anatomical results and patient-reported outcomes of our technique of vaginal vault fixation at the time of vaginal hysterectomy. METHODS One hundred and nine patients-mean 69 years, range 50.4-83.8; body mass index (BMI) 26.3, range 17.7-39.5-with symptomatic stage 2-3 uterine prolapse combined with stage 3-4 cystocele underwent vaginal hysterectomy with anterior vaginal wall repair; the apex was formed with high closure of the peritoneum and incorporation of the uterosacral and round ligaments. Only absorbable sutures were used. Follow-up included clinical examination with Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system (POP-Q) scoring, introital ultrasonography, quality of life (QoL) Likert scale, and the German Pelvic Floor Questionnaire. RESULTS Seventy patients (64%) were available for a follow-up after a mean of 2.8 years (range, 1.6-4.2). At follow-up, point C was stage 0 in 55 (78.6%) women and stage 1 in 15 (21.4%). The anterior vaginal wall was stage 0 or 1 in 35 (50%), stage 2 (no cystocele beyond the hymen) in 34 (49%), and stage 3 in 1 (1.4%). Vaginal length (VL) was 9 cm. Four women (4%) were reoperated for prolapse: two for recurrent anterior compartment prolapse and two for de novo rectocele. Postvoid residuals >150 ml were seen in 21(30%) patients preoperatively and resolved postoperatively in 20. Urgency occurred in nine (13%), stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in ten (14%), and nocturia in 19 (27%). No patient had discomfort at the vaginal vault and 62 patients (87%) reported improved QoL, which did not correlate with anatomical results. Cystocele ≥ 2° at follow-up was associated with BMI >25 (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Our surgical technique without permanent material offers good apical support and functional and subjective results.

Specific mechanical features of tunneled cuffed catheters may improve hemodynamic performance and decrease thrombosis and infection rates. However, there currently is no proven advantage of one design over another. STUDY DESIGN Single-center randomized clinical trial. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS 302 hemodialysis patients who required a tunneled cuffed catheter as temporary or definite vascular access. INTERVENTION Palindrome Symmetric Tip Dialysis Catheter or HemoStar Long-Term Hemodialysis Catheter. OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS The primary end point was primary assisted patency. Secondary end points were incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs), thrombosis, and 2 indicators of rheologic function: mean effective blood flow rate and urokinase use. RESULTS Mean primary assisted patency was 135.9 days for Palindrome and 136.5 days for HemoStar (P=0.8). Definite CRBSI occurred in 0.24 and 0.10/1,000 catheter-days for Palindrome and HemoStar, respectively (P=0.3). Removal rates for thrombosis that could not be resolved with thrombolysis were 0.53 and 0.43/1,000 catheter-days for Palindrome and HemoStar, respectively (P=0.7). Urokinase use was lower for Palindrome than for HemoStar, as evidenced by a lower number of urokinase infusions/1,000 catheter-days (17 and 35; P<0.001) and higher number of catheters that never required thrombolysis (58% and 45%; P=0.03). Mean effective blood flow rate was higher for Palindrome than for HemoStar (333 and 304mL/min; P<0.001). LIMITATIONS Single-center nonblinded trial. CONCLUSIONS Primary assisted patency and incidence of infection and thrombosis were similar for both catheter types. The Palindrome catheter required less thrombolysis and achieved higher blood flow rates than the HemoStar catheter. These findings suggest that mechanical catheter design may improve catheter rheology, but does not affect risks for thrombosis and infection and hence catheter survival.","Van Der Meersch, Hans; De Bacquer, Dirk; Vandecasteele, Stefaan J; Van den Bergh, Barbara; Vermeiren, Pieter; De Letter, Jan; De Vriese, An S",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,371,1

Thus, maneuvers to relieve such obstructions are recommended. There have been no studies to determine whether the sniffing or neutral position is superior for this purpose. Therefore, this study was performed to examine the effects of these two positions including vocal cord view. METHODS Fifty-four patients scheduled to receive general anesthesia by orotracheal intubation were eligible for inclusion in the study with informed consent. After confirmation of proper head positioning depending on the group, the view of the vocal cord was acquired in each position. Images were reviewed using the percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score. RESULTS A total of 106 images of vocal cords from 53 patients were obtained. The mean of difference of POGO score was 11.09, higher for the neutral position and standard deviation was 23.73 (p = 0.002). Neutral position increased POGO score in 31 patients and decreased POGO score in 13 patients compare to sniffing position (p = 0.017). There were no significant differences between the two head positions with regard to intubation time or degree of convenience during intubation. CONCLUSIONS Neutral position improved the view of glottic opening than sniffing position during oral fiberoptic intubation.

To promote healthy eating, nutrition labels have been mandated to certain foods in many countries. To test how different designs of nutrition labels affect consumer behavior, eye tracking technique has been increasingly used to overcome the limitations of subjective report which are susceptible to different biases and a poor indicator of nutrition label use in reality. In this review, we reviewed 45 eye-tracking studies on nutrition label processing. Besides a summary of eye tracking methodology, we found three emerged topics from these studies: attention capture, nutrition label comprehension and food choice. Overall, updated designs of nutrition labels improve attention capture and nutrition label comprehension, but it does not necessarily lead to healthier food choices. The discrepancy between attention capture and food choice also indicate potential limitation in promoting healthy food choice via the indirect attention route (exposure - attention - nutrition label processing - food choice). Instead, actual food choice may be a consequence of a direct heuristic route and modulated by person-, product- and context-related factors. These findings can not only guide future studies, but also have implications on making nutrition label policy and improving human health in eastern developing countries.","Ma, Guojie; Zhuang, Xiangling",Appetite,371,12

We have previously demonstrated that OxPAPC (oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) significantly enhances vascular endothelial barrier properties in vitro and in vivo and attenuates endothelial hyperpermeability induced by inflammatory and edemagenic agents via Rac and Cdc42 GTPase dependent mechanisms. These findings suggested potential important therapeutic value of barrier-protective oxidized phospholipids. In this study, we examined involvement of signaling complexes associated with caveolin-enriched microdomains (CEMs) in barrier-protective responses of human pulmonary ECs to OxPAPC. Immunoblotting from OxPAPC-treated ECs revealed OxPAPC-mediated rapid recruitment (5 minutes) to CEMs of the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P(1)), the serine/threonine kinase Akt, and the Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1 and phosphorylation of caveolin-1, indicative of signaling activation in CEMs. Abolishing CEM formation (methyl-beta-cyclodextrin) blocked OxPAPC-mediated Rac1 activation, cytoskeletal reorganization, and EC barrier enhancement. Silencing (small interfering RNA) Akt expression blocked OxPAPC-mediated S1P(1) activation (threonine phosphorylation), whereas silencing S1P(1) receptor expression blocked OxPAPC-mediated Tiam1 recruitment to CEMs, Rac1 activation, and EC barrier enhancement. To confirm our in vitro results in an in vivo murine model of acute lung injury with pulmonary vascular hyperpermeability, we observed that selective lung silencing of caveolin-1 or S1P(1) receptor expression blocked OxPAPC-mediated protection from ventilator-induced lung injury. Taken together, these results suggest Akt-dependent transactivation of S1P(1) within CEMs is important for OxPAPC-mediated cortical actin rearrangement and EC barrier protection.","Singleton, Patrick A; Chatchavalvanich, Santipongse; Fu, Panfeng; Xing, Junjie; Birukova, Anna A; Fortune, Jennifer A; Klibanov, Alexander M; Garcia, Joe G N; Birukov, Konstantin G",Circulation research,371,16

METHODS Fish were collected using multi-panel gill nets. The gills of each fish were washed and examined for copepods using a stereo microscope. The copepods found were stored in 70% ethanol, cleared in lactic acid, and mounted in Hoyer's medium. Drawings were made with the aid of a microscope equipped with a drawing tube. RESULTS The new copepod species can be distinguished from its two congeners, Rhinergasilus piranhus (type-species) Boeger et Thatcher, 1988 and Rhinergasilus digitus Narciso, Brandão, Perbiche-Neves et Silva, 2020, due to its extremely long antennary claw (etymology of the species), being longer than the other antennary segments; third leg lacking any interpodal plate; and third endopodal segment of third leg lacking a distal spine. CONCLUSIONS Based on the morphological differences, we erected a new species of Rhinergasilus. The new copepod represents the second report of a Rhinergasilus species parasitizing a fish from the Jurumirim Reservoir. It also represents the first report of this genus in P. lineatus.","Narciso, Rodrigo Bravin; Perbiche-Neves, Gilmar; da Silva, Reinaldo José",Acta parasitologica,371,1

The authors report the first 297 cases in a multi-institutional and multinational review of laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed via a single portal of entry. METHODS Data were collected retrospectively for the initial patients undergoing single-port cholecystectomy by 13 surgeons who performed these procedures in their institutions after training by the authors. The review included operative time, blood loss, incision length, length of hospital stay (LOS), necessary additional trocars, and other parameters important to cholecystectomy. A database of all the single-port-access (SPA) surgeries performed by the surgeons included demographic and procedural details, LOS, complications, and initial follow-up data. RESULTS To date, 297 single-port cholecystectomies have been performed for a variety of diagnoses, primarily cholelithiasis. The average operative time was 71 min, and the average LOS was 1-2 days. The average blood loss was minimal. The use of additional port sites outside the umbilicus occurred in 34 of the cases. Of the 35 intraoperative cholangiograms performed, 34 were successful. No significant complications occurred except for seromas and minor postoperative wound infections. These results are comparable with those for standard multiport cholecystectomy. In addition, no access site hernias (ASH) occurred. CONCLUSIONS The findings demonstrate that SPA surgery is an alternative to multiport laparoscopy with fewer scars and better cosmesis. One factor affecting the rate for adoption of SPA surgery among other surgeons is the reproducibility of this new procedure. Although this study had insufficient data to determine fully the benefits of SPA surgery, the feasibility of this procedure with safe, acceptable results was demonstrated in this initial large series across multinational institutions.","Curcillo, Paul G; Wu, Andrew S; Podolsky, Erica R; Graybeal, Casey; Katkhouda, Namir; Saenz, Alex; Dunham, Robert; Fendley, Steven; Neff, Marc; Copper, Chad; Bessler, Marc; Gumbs, Andrew A; Norton, Michael; Iannelli, Antonio; Mason, Rodney; Moazzez, Ashkan; Cohen, Larry; Mouhlas, Angela; Poor, Alex",Surgical endoscopy,371,1

Patients that develop adverse drug reactions tend to have prolonged stays in hospital and may require to change to alternative regimens if reactions persist upon rechallenge or if rechallenge is contraindicated due to severity of the adverse reaction. Diagnosis of DILI remains a huge obstacle that delays timely interventions, since it is still based largely on exclusion of other causes. There is an urgent need to develop robust diagnostic and predictive biomarkers that could be used alongside the available tools (biopsy, imaging, and serological tests for liver enzymes) to give a specific diagnosis of DILI. Crucial to this is also achieving consensus in the definition of DILI so that robust studies can be undertaken. Importantly, it is crucial that we gain deeper insights into the mechanism of DILI so that patients can receive appropriate management. In general, it has been demonstrated that the mechanism of ART-induced liver injury is driven by four main mechanisms: mitochondrial toxicity, metabolic host-mediated injury, immune reconstitution, and hypersensitivity reactions. The focus of this review is to discuss the type and phenotypes of DILI that are caused by the first line ART regimens. Furthermore, we will summarize recent studies that have elucidated the cellular and molecular mechanisms of DILI both in vivo and in vitro.","Pillaye, Jamie N; Marakalala, Mohlopheni J; Khumalo, Nonhlanhla; Spearman, Wendy; Ndlovu, Hlumani",Pharmacology research & perspectives,371,1

Human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) generated three macrophage populations, occupying separate anatomical niches in the lung. Intravascular cell labeling, cell transplantation, and fate-mapping studies established that classical CD14+ blood monocytes derived from HSPCs migrated into lung tissue and gave rise to human interstitial and alveolar macrophages. In contrast, non-classical CD16+ blood monocytes preferentially generated macrophages resident in the lung vasculature (pulmonary intravascular macrophages).

However, a high rate of reoperations for failure and severe complications was reported in long-term studies. Around 50% of the patients underwent conversion to other bariatric procedures. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to report our experience in laparoscopic conversion of failed VBG and SRVG to biliopancreatic diversion (BPD). SETTINGS The setting of the study was at the University hospital. METHODS Between March 2010 and July 2013, 12 patients underwent laparoscopic conversion of VBG and SRVG to BPD. Using a prospectively collected database, we analyzed their data and outcomes. RESULTS Eighty-six percent of the conversions were successfully completed laparoscopically. The mean operative time was 220 min. There was no mortality. Perioperative complications occurred in four patients (33%). One (9%) late complication, an adhesional small bowel obstruction, was encountered later than 30 days postoperatively. The follow-up rate was 100%, but only three patients reached 3 years at the time of this writing. At a mean follow-up of 19 (3-40) months, the mean body mass index (BMI) decreased from 45.3 to 27.8 kg/m2. Percent excess weight loss (EWL) was 65.7, and 86.3% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic conversion of failed VBG to BPD is feasible and effective in further reducing weight in morbidly obese patients. Weight loss continues beyond the first postoperative year. However, the complication rate is much higher than in the primary procedure.","Abu-Gazala, Samir; Sadot, Eran; Maler, Ilanit; Golomb, Inbal; Carmeli, Idan; Keidar, Andrei",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,371,20

High-quality evidence for widespread implementation is lacking. This systematic review aimed to assess the RAS evidence base for the quality of randomized evidence on safety and effectiveness, specialty 'clustering', and outcomes for RAS research. METHODS A systematic review was undertaken according to PRISMA guidelines. All pathologies and procedures utilizing RAS were included. Studies were limited to RCTs, the English language and publication within the last decade. The main outcomes selected for the review design were safety and efficacy, and study purpose. Secondary outcomes were study characteristics, funding and governance. RESULTS Searches identified 7142 titles, from which 183 RCTs were identified for data extraction. The commonest specialty was urology (35·0 per cent). There were just 76 unique study populations, indicating significant overlap of publications; 103 principal studies were assessed further. Only 64·1 per cent of studies reported a primary outcome measure, with 29·1 per cent matching their registration/protocol. Safety was assessed in 68·9 per cent of trials; operative complications were the commonest measure. Forty-eight per cent of trials reported no significant difference in safety between RAS and comparator, and 11 per cent reported RAS to be superior. Efficacy or effectiveness was assessed in 80·6 per cent of trials; 43 per cent of trials showed no difference between RAS and comparator, and 24 per cent reported that RAS was superior. Funding was declared in 47·6 per cent of trials. CONCLUSION The evidence base for RAS is of limited quality and variable transparency in reporting. No patterns of harm to patients were identified.

These capabilities introduce a new frontier in cardiology, enabling the practitioner/investigator to quantify biologically important myocardial properties that otherwise can be difficult to ascertain clinically. CMR may be able to track biologically important changes in the myocardium by: a) native T1 that reflects myocardial disease involving the myocyte and interstitium without use of gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCA), or b) the extracellular volume fraction (ECV)-a direct GBCA-based measurement of the size of the extracellular space, reflecting interstitial disease.

A rapid reconstitution of antiviral responses via adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cells (VSTs) can prevent or eradicate even refractory infections. Here, we evaluate this strategy and the associated methodological, manufacturing and clinical advances. RECENT FINDINGS From the early pioneering but cumbersome efforts to isolate CMV-specific T cell clones, new approaches and techniques have been developed to provide quicker, safer and broader-aimed ex-vivo antigen-specific cells. New manufacturing strategies, such as the use of G-Rex flasks or 'priming' with a library of overlapping viral peptides, allow for culturing greater numbers of cells that could be patient-specific or stored in cell banks for off-the-shelf applications. Rapid isolation of T cells using major histocompatibility complex tetramer or cytokine capture approaches, or genetic reprogramming of cells to target viral antigens can accelerate the generation of potent cellular products. SUMMARY Advances in the ex-vivo generation of VSTs in academic medical centres and as off-the-shelf blood bank-based or commercially produced reagents are likely to result in broader accessibility and possible manufacturing cost reduction of these cell products, and will open new therapeutic prospects for vulnerable and critically ill immunocompromised patients.","Migliori, Edoardo; Chang, Mark; Muranski, Pawel",Current opinion in hematology,371,19

Branched structures are ubiquitous in both the physical and the biological realms. Fractility has therefore been termed nature's design. The fractal properties of the bronchial (airway) system, the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein of the human lung generates large respiratory surface area that is crammed in the lung. Also, it permits the inhaled air to intimately approximate the pulmonary capillary blood across a very thin blood-gas barrier through which gas exchange to occur by diffusion. Here, the bronchial (airway) and vascular systems were simultaneously cast with latex rubber. After corrosion, the bronchial and vascular system casts were physically separated and cleared to expose the branches. The morphogenetic (Weibel's) ordering method was used to categorize the branches on which the diameters and the lengths, as well as the angles of bifurcation, were measured. The fractal dimensions (DF) were determined by plotting the total branch measurements against the mean branch diameters on double logarithmic coordinates (axes). The diameter-determined DF values were 2.714 for the bronchial system, 2.882 for the pulmonary artery and 2.334 for the pulmonary vein while the respective values from lengths were 3.098, 3.916 and 4.041. The diameters yielded DF values that were consistent with the properties of fractal structures (i.e. self-similarity and space-filling).

The purpose of this study was to examine the variables that affect total joint arthroplasty reimbursement. Along with standard economic variables, we include unique health-care variables. Given the focus on value in the Affordable Care Act, the model examines the relationship of the quality of care to total joint arthroplasty reimbursement. We hoped to find that reimbursement patterns reward quality and reflect standard economic principles. METHODS Multivariable regression was performed to identify variables that correlate with Medicare reimbursement for total joint arthroplasty. Inpatient charge or reimbursement data on Medicare reimbursements were available for 2,750 hospitals with at least 10 discharges for uncomplicated total joint arthroplasty from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for fiscal year 2011. Reimbursement variability was examined by using the Dartmouth Atlas to group institutions into hospital referral regions and hospital service areas. Independent variables were taken from the Dartmouth Atlas, CMS, the WWAMI (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, Idaho) Rural Health Research Center, and the United States Census. RESULTS There were 427,207 total joint arthroplasties identified, with a weighted mean reimbursement of $14,324.84 (range, $9,103 to $38,686). Nationally, the coefficient of variation for reimbursements was 0.19. The regression model accounted for 52.5% of reimbursement variation among providers. The total joint arthroplasty provider volume (p < 0.001) and patient satisfaction (p < 0.001) were negatively correlated with reimbursement. Government ownership of a hospital (p < 0.001) and higher Medicare costs (p < 0.001) correlated positively with reimbursement. CONCLUSIONS Medicare reimbursements for total joint arthroplasty are highly variable. Greater reimbursement was associated with lower patient volume, lower patient satisfaction, a healthier patient population, and government ownership of a hospital. As value-based reimbursement provisions of the Affordable Care Act are implemented, there will be dramatic changes in total joint arthroplasty reimbursements. To meet these changes, providers should expect qualities such as high patient volume, willingness to care for sicker patient populations, patient satisfaction, safe outcomes, and procedural demand to correlate with their reimbursement. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Practicing orthopaedic surgeons and hospital administrators should be aware of discrepancies in inpatient reimbursement for total joint arthroplasty from Medicare. Furthermore, these discrepancies are not associated with typical economic factors.

We studied the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms and other intracranial neurovascular pathologies such as arteriovenous malformations and intracranial dissections, in these 4 patient populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all patients who had a clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, or Loeys-Dietz syndrome who underwent MRA, CTA, and/or DSA imaging of the intracranial circulation between January 1, 2005, and January 31, 2015. The presence, location, and maximum dimensions of intracranial aneurysms were catalogued. Other neurovascular findings studied included intracranial dissections and arteriovenous fistulas and shunts. Baseline data collected included demographic characteristics (sex, age, smoking history), imaging modality, and cardiovascular comorbidities. RESULTS The prevalence of intracranial saccular and fusiform aneurysms was as follows: 14% (8/59) among patients with Marfan syndrome, 12% (12/99) among patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, 11% (5/47) among patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, and 28% (7/25) among patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Intracranial dissections were found in 2 patients (3%) with Marfan syndrome and 1 patient (1%) with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. No intracranial dissections were found in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 or Loeys-Dietz syndrome. CONCLUSIONS Patients with connective tissue disorders, including Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome, have a high prevalence of intracranial aneurysms.","Kim, S T; Brinjikji, W; Kallmes, D F",AJNR.

In this study we aimed to determine pressures generated in hemodialysis catheters during power injection of computed tomography (CT) contrast media. METHODS Three different chronic hemodialysis catheters and two acute hemodialysis catheters were included in this study. All catheters were evaluated in vitro. A total volume of 120 cc of CT contrast material was injected at rate of 10 cc/s using a power injector. The catheters were connected to the power injector using a standard connecting tubing. Pressures were simultaneously measured in the power injector as well as in the hemodialysis catheters. RESULTS The maximal measured pressures during injection in the power injector averaged 338 PSI (SD ± 8.7 PSI). The maximal measured pressure in the dialysis catheters ranged between 9.17 and 21.2 PSI. Pressures averaged 14.02 PSI (SD ± 3.34 PSI). The average pressure in the power injector was over 23 times higher than the pressure recorded at the hemodialysis catheter. None of the catheters ruptured or deformed during testing. CONCLUSIONS Pressures measured in hemodialysis catheters during power injection are lower than currently believed and markedly lower than the pressures recorded in the power injector. Standard hemodialysis catheters are likely to be amenable to power contrast injection in hemodialysis patients who have limited venous access. In vivo studies are necessary to confirm these findings.,"Hollander, Scott; Mojibian, Hamid; Emery, Michael; Tal, Michael G",The journal of vascular access,371,17

However, these cells are vulnerable to lysis by allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells due to their lack of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecule expression. Here, constitutive expression of mutant B2M-HLA-E (mBE) and B2M-HLA-G (mBG) fusion proteins in anti-CD19 UCAR T (UCAR T-19) cells was conducted to protect against allogeneic NK cell-mediated lysis. The ability of cells expressing mBE or mBG to resist NK cell-mediated lysis was observed in gene-edited Jurkat CAR19 cells. UCAR T-19 cells constitutively expressing the mBE and mBG fusion proteins were manufactured and showed effective and specific anti-tumor activity. Constitutive expression of the mBE and mBG fusion proteins in UCAR T-19 cells prevented allogeneic NK cell-mediated lysis. In addition, these cells were not recognizable by allogeneic T cells. Additional experiments, including those in animal models and clinical trials, are required to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UCAR T-19 cells that constitutively express mBE and mBG.

Method The sample of the study consisted of 110 patients admitted to the Chest Diseases polyclinic of a private hospital and diagnosed as COPD for at least one year. The data of the study were collected using the ""Individual Information Form"", ""COPD and Asthma Sleep Scale (CASIS)"" and ""Medical Research Council (MRC) Dyspnoea Scale"". Results It was found that 6.4% of the patients did not experience dyspnoea, 34.5% had mild, 40.9% had moderate, and 18.2% had severe dyspnoea. The mean CASIS score of the patients without dyspnoea was 29.08±7.83, with mild dyspnoea was 40.22±9.30, with moderate dyspnoea was 50.31±8.97 and with severe dyspnoea was 56.96±13.13. There was a statistically significant difference between dyspnoea severity and mean CASIS score (p=0.001). Correlation analysis between MRC dyspnoea scale and CASIS score showed a significant positive correlation (r=0.61 p=0.001). Conclusion It was concluded that the majority of COPD patients had moderate or poor sleep quality and dyspnoea.

METHODS This review is based on guidelines, reviews, meta-analyses, selected publications, and the authors' own experiences from everyday clinical practice. RESULTS Most patients want frank information from their physicians about their condition at all times over the course of their treatment, from the moment of diagnosis to the end of their life. This has no lasting adverse effects, but rather enables patients to take decisions that are appropriate to their stage of disease. Early integration in palliative care can improve patients' quality of life, symptom control, and mood. In helping to manage the last phase of life, the physician often serves as a provider of impulses, or else determines which other types of professional should counsel or support the patient. Patients should be enabled to issue directives that reflect their wishes, as well as to choose representatives who are allowed to speak for them. Consideration should also be given to the patient's emotional legacy, e.g., letters or video messages with personal content. CONCLUSION In the care of patients with life-limiting diseases, more attention should be paid to the management of the last phase of life. Palliative-care physicians can take over this task from other medical disciplines, and early integration in palliative care is recommended.","Welsch, Katja; Gottschling, Sven",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,371,31

The City of Guelph relies on groundwater for a population of over 130,000 people. Thus, groundwater quality is a critical component of long-term water management. This study assesses the effect of urban, industrial and agriculture activities on groundwater quality using a suite of multidisciplinary methods including geological, hydrological, geochemical, and isotopic tools. Multi-level systems (with depth-discrete ports), conventional well clusters, and municipal production wells were used to monitor hydraulic head and collect groundwater samples. Geochemical and isotopic measurements included redox parameters, major anions and cations, VOC, tritium and δ34S and δ18O in sulfate. Hydraulic head data show vertical gradient profiles characteristic of a multi-layered flow system within a shallow and deep Silurian bedrock aquifer and an intermediate aquitard varying in occurrence. Head loss disappears near production wells, showing enhanced vertical hydraulic connectivity between shallow and deep aquifers, attributed to pumping and long open intervals. Hydrochemical data show no impact of nitrate and high chloride is observed in the shallow and deep aquifer, attributed to seasonal road salt and the underlying aquitard unit, respectively. The aquitard unit also control the high sulfate in the deep aquifer which is supported by the isotope data on sulfate. Facilitated transport of shallow groundwater into the deeper aquifer is supported by the tritium data, showing the presence of recent groundwater throughout the whole depth of the two aquifers in some areas, likely due to the varying aquitard presence and enhanced vertical flow due to proximity from pumping municipal wells and active rock quarry. The results of this research suggest long term implications for groundwater resource management of sedimentary bedrock aquifers, where there is increasing groundwater demand due to population growth and potential for continual water quality degradation.","Nunes, M A; Aravena, R; Parker, B L",The Science of the total environment,371,1

Patients with multiple co-morbidities are more likely to develop these severe forms of the disease. The aim of this report is to highlight cases the analysis of which might help discover factors that influence the course and mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia. The past medical history of our elderly patient (75-year-old female) includes rectum resection with intraoperative cardiac arrest and successful resuscitation. In January 2020, the patient was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon and concomittant pulmonary embolism. Following 6 weeks of therapeutic dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) treatment, the cancerous colonic section was resected. The patient arrested intraoperatively but was successfully resuscitated. On post-operative day 15, the patient developed arterial anastomosis bleed, which necessitated acute right-sided hemicolectomy. Post-operatively she became pyrexial and COVID-19 was confirmed, but later became apyrexial with symptomatic treatment. Subsequently, the patient developed partial anastomosis insufficiency, which resolved with conservative management. Following three negative SARS-CoV-2 tests, she was successfully discharged from hospital. It is worthy of note that due to the active anastomosis bleed the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor treatment was stopped, and later the patient got infected with SARS-CoV-2. A long-lasting LMWH therapy was performed. The timely management of colorectal carcinoms remains important even during an epidemic. The appropriate treatment of these patients during the pandemic presents a great challenge for all doctors, but, as shown in our case report, surgical treatment of even those with multiple co-morbidities can be successful.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to describe the perioperative management of pediatric patients undergoing CHLT at a single institution and to identify management strategies that may be used to optimize perioperative care. METHODS We did a retrospective database review of all patients receiving CHLT at a children's hospital between 2006 and 2014. Information collected included preoperative characteristics, intraoperative management, blood transfusions, and postoperative morbidity and mortality. RESULTS Five pediatric CHLTs were performed over an 8-year period. All patients had a history of complex CHD with multiple sternotomies, three of whom had failing Fontan physiology. Patient age ranged from 7 to 23 years and weight from 29.5 to 68.5 kg. All CHLTs were performed using an en-bloc technique where both the donor heart and liver were implanted together on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The median operating room time was 14.25 h, median CPB time was 3.58 h, and median donor ischemia time was 4.13 h. Patients separated from CPB on dopamine, epinephrine, and milrinone infusions and two required inhaled nitric oxide. All patients received a massive intraoperative blood transfusion post CPB with amounts ranging from one to three times the patient's estimated blood volume. The patient who required the most transfusions was in decompensated heart and liver failure preoperatively. Four of the five patients received an antifibrinolytic agent as well as a procoagulant (prothrombin complex concentrate or recombinant activated Factor VII) to assist with hemostasis. There were no 30-day thromboembolic events detected. Postoperatively the median length of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and stay to hospital discharge was 4, 8, and 37 days, respectively. All patients are alive and free from allograft rejection at this time. CONCLUSION Combined heart and liver transplantation in the pediatric population involves a complex group of patients with unique perioperative challenges. Successful management starts with thorough preoperative planning and communication and involves strategies to deal with massive intraoperative hemorrhage and coagulopathy in addition to protecting and supporting the transplanted heart and liver and meticulous surgical technique. An integrated multidisciplinary team approach is the cornerstone for successful outcomes.","Navaratnam, Manchula; Ng, Ann; Williams, Glyn D; Maeda, Katsuhide; Mendoza, Julianne M; Concepcion, Waldo; Hollander, Seth A; Ramamoorthy, Chandra",Paediatric anaesthesia,371,1

Patients undergoing PAO for acetabular dysplasia have postoperative pain that can be managed with epidural analgesia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the timing of the discontinuation of epidural analgesia on pain, opioid usage, and hospital length of stay (LOS). The study hypothesis was that removal of the epidural catheter on postoperative day 1 (POD1) would lead to reduced overall opioid usage and LOS compared with removal on POD2. METHODS This is a retrospective before-and-after observational review of the impact of discontinuing epidural analgesia on POD1 versus POD2 in terms of in-hospital pain, opioid usage, and LOS. Baseline patient factors such as age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) as well as outcomes including mean and median of daily pain, total oral morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) used per day, and LOS were recorded. Descriptive and comparative statistical analyses including multivariable main-effects linear regression modeling were performed to evaluate the impact of the timing of epidural removal on outcomes. RESULTS Directly comparing outcomes for the day of epidural removal, patients with removal on POD1 had significantly less pain (mean of 4.6 versus 5.1 on the numeric rating scale [NRS], p = 0.033) and opioid usage (130.7 versus 200.4 MMEs, p < 0.001) than patients with removal on POD2. Additionally, LOS (3.3 versus 4.6 days, p < 0.001) and total opioid usage (333.0 versus 674.8 MMEs, p < 0.001) were significantly reduced in patients with epidural removal on POD1. These results persisted in multivariable analyses that were adjusted for age, sex, and BMI. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that patients with epidural removal on POD1 have significantly lower pain and an overall decrease in opioid usage on the date of epidural removal compared with patients undergoing epidural removal on POD2. Additionally, they have a shorter LOS as well as lower total opioid usage. Decreasing the duration of epidural usage may reduce pain, opioid usage, and LOS in patients undergoing PAO.

However, in the long-term follow-up, weight loss failure and intractable severe reflux after primary LSG can necessitate further surgical interventions, and revisional sleeve gastrectomy (ReSG) can represent an option to correct these. METHODS From October 2008 to June 2013, 36 patients underwent an ReSG for progressive weight regain, insufficient weight, or severe gastroesophageal reflux in 'La Casamance' Private Hospital. All patients with weight loss failure after primary LSG underwent radiological evaluation. If Gastrografin swallow showed a huge unresected fundus or an upper gastric pouch dilatation, or if the computed tomography (CT) scan volumetry revealed a gastric tube superior to 250 cc, ReSG was proposed. RESULTS Thirty-six patients (34 women, two men; mean age 41.3 years) with a body mass index (BMI) of 39.9 underwent ReSG. Thirteen patients (36.1 %) had their original LSG surgery performed at another hospital and were referred to us for weight loss failure. Twenty-four patients (66.6 %) out of 36 had a history of gastric banding with weight loss failure. Thirteen patients (36.1 %) were super-obese (BMI > 50) before primary LSG. The LSG was realized for patients with morbid obesity with a mean BMI of 47.1 (range 35.4-77.9). The mean interval time from the primary LSG to ReSG was 34.5 months (range 9-67 months). The indication for ReSG was insufficient weight loss for 19 patients (52.8 %), weight regain for 15 patients (41.7 %), and 2 patients underwent ReSG for invalidating gastroesophageal reflux disease. In 24 cases the Gastrografin swallow results were interpreted as primary dilatation, and in the remaining 12 cases results were interpreted as secondary dilatation. The CT scan volumetry was realized in 21 cases, and it has revealed a mean gastric volume of 387.8 cc (range 275-555 cc). All 36 cases were completed by laparoscopy with no intraoperative incidents. The mean operative time was 43 min (range 29-70 min), and the mean hospital stay was 3.9 days (range 3-16 days). One perigastric hematoma was recorded. The mean BMI decreased to 29.2 (range 20.24-37.5); the mean percentage of excess weight loss was 58.5 % (±25.3) (p < 0.0004) for a mean follow-up of 20 months (range 6-56 months). CONCLUSIONS The ReSG may be a valid option for failure of primary LSG for both primary or secondary dilatation. Long-term results of ReSG are awaited to prove efficiency. Further prospective clinical trials are required to compare the outcomes of ReSG with those of Roux en Y Gastric Bypass or DS for weight loss failure after LSG.","Noel, Patrick; Nedelcu, Marius; Nocca, David; Schneck, Anne-Sophie; Gugenheim, Jean; Iannelli, Antonio; Gagner, Michel",Surgical endoscopy,371,16

This commentary offers patient counseling recommendations based on the current available evidence. While there are currently no specific data for psoriasis biologics and COVID-19, data are presented here from phase III clinical trials of psoriasis biologics on rates of upper respiratory infection, influenza, and serious infection. Overall these data reveal that on the whole, psoriasis biologics do not show major increases in infection risk compared to placebo during the course of these trials. However, as the COVID-19 virus is a novel pathogen that is associated with mortality in a subset of patients, a cautious approach is warranted. We discuss factors that may alter the benefit-risk ratio of biologic use during this time of COVID-19 outbreak. Ultimately, treatment decisions should be made on the basis of dialogue between patient and provider, considering each patient's individualized situation. Once this pandemic has passed, it is only a matter of time before a new viral disease reignites the same issues discussed here.","Brownstone, Nicholas D; Thibodeaux, Quinn G; Reddy, Vidhatha D; Myers, Bridget A; Chan, Stephanie Y; Bhutani, Tina; Liao, Wilson",Dermatology and therapy,371,1

Maternal influenza infection during pregnancy has been associated with the development of schizophrenia in offspring. Viral infections in neonates, children, and adolescents have also been associated with later development of schizophrenia. Neuroinvasive and/or systemic infections are thought to increase risk for psychopathology via inflammatory mechanisms, particularly when exposure occurs during critical neurodevelopmental windows. Several human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been associated with psychotic disorders and increasing reports of the neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 suggest it has neuroinvasive properties similar to those of other HCoVs. These properties, in conjunction with its ability to generate a massive inflammatory response, suggest that COVID-19 may also contribute to future psychopathology. This review will summarize the psychopathogenic mechanisms of viral infections and discuss the neuroinvasive and inflammatory properties of COVID-19 that could contribute to the development of psychotic disorders, with a focus on in utero, neonatal, and childhood exposure.","Kulaga, Stephanie S; Miller, Christopher W T",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,371,33

Abraham, MD.",16.61292,9.30335,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND Closed suction catheters are commonly used with pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) in ventilator-dependent patients receiving bronchodilator therapy. Although heated/humidified circuits result in a decrease in drug delivery, no studies have investigated the impact of a closed suction catheter with a pMDI on aerosol delivery during mechanical ventilation. We sought to quantify aerosol delivery with a variety of closed suction catheters and pMDI adapters in a simulated ventilator-dependent adult lung model with and without exhaled humidity. METHODS A ventilator (tidal volume 450 mL, PEEP 5 cm H2O, breathing frequency 15 breaths/min, peak flow 60 L/min, and bias flow 2 L/min) was attached to 3 closed suction catheter designs (T-piece, double swivel elbow, and a multi-access port) with pMDI adapters (small- and large-unidirectional adapters, a bidirectional adapter, and a built-in port) connected to an endotracheal tube (ETT) with a collecting filter and a passive test lung. To simulate exhaled humidity, a heated humidifier was placed between the collection filter and the distal tip of the ETT, set at 36°C. Experiments without exhaled humidity were performed with no heat and humidification. For each test, 4 puffs of albuterol sulfate (432 μg) were administered. The drug was eluted from the collecting filter and analyzed via spectrophotometer (276 nm). Each experiment was run 3 times. RESULTS Delivery efficiency of the bidirectional adapter was greatest compared to other adapters tested in this study (P = .01). Aerosol deposition obtained from the combination of the T-piece closed suction catheter and the bidirectional adapter was more than that from the multi-access port (P = .42) and double swivel closed suction catheter (P = .27). Drug delivery without exhaled humidity exceeded values with exhaled humidity by 20-90% using the small unidirectional, large unidirectional, and bidirectional adapters (P = .01, P = .02 and P = .02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Closed suction catheter, pMDI spacer/adapters, and exhalation conditions have an impact on drug delivery during simulated adult mechanical ventilation. Aerosol delivery without exhaled humidity appears to report unrealistically high values in comparison to the more accurate values with simulated exhalation humidity.","Williams, Jacqueline P; Ari, Arzu; Shanmugam, Ramalingam; Fink, James B",Respiratory care,371,31

Previous studies have based their criteria for diagnosis of IAD on conventional angiography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. We report a case with acute ischemic stroke due to spontaneous basilar artery dissection in which intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to show features of IAD. A 59-years-old woman presented with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke. Thrombosis related to basilar artery (BA) stenosis was assumed on conventional angiography; however, no clot was retrieved after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) and a restored BA caliber was observed after a rescue recanalization with the detachment of a self-expanding stent was performed. Spontaneous IAD was suspected; however, angiographic findings were ambiguous for confirming IAD. The patient remained symptom-free until 18-months follow-up. At this point, angiography showed restenosis at the proximal tapered length of the stent. In vivo OCT was performed to assess the pathological changes of the restenosis and confirm the diagnosis of IAD.OCT revealed BA dissection with the presence of remnant transverse flap, double lumen and mural hematoma. Imaging at multiple levels identified intimal disruption that originated in the right vertebral artery and extended distally to the BA. The use of intravascular imaging with OCT enabled the accurate diagnosis of IAD. Care should be taken as the procedure may add additional risks to the patient. Future studies are needed to validate the safety of OCT in IAD.","Gao, Peng; Gui, Liqiang; Yang, Bin; Krings, Timo; Jiao, Liqun",Frontiers in neurology,371,12

However, less than 20% of eligible U.S. citizens have been offered the chance to register to vote at a government-funded agency like a hospital or clinic that provides Medicaid or Medicare services. Medical students are well positioned to increase voting access due to their interactions with multiple actors in health care settings, including patients, visitors, colleagues, and others. APPROACH Vot-ER, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that aims to promote civic engagement in health care settings, launched the inaugural Healthy Democracy Campaign from July 20 to October 9, 2020. As part of this national, gamification-based competition, medical student captains were recruited to lead teams of health care trainees and professionals that helped eligible adults start the voter registration and/or mail-in ballot request processes prior to the November 2020 elections. Post competition, medical student captains were surveyed about their motivations for participating and skills and knowledge gained. OUTCOMES In total, 128 medical student captains at 80 medical schools in 31 states and the District of Columbia formed teams that helped 15,692 adults start the voter registration and/or mail-in ballot request processes. Eighty-two (64.1%) captains responded to the post competition survey, representing 56 (70.0%) of the participating schools. The top ranked motivation for participating in the campaign was the desire to address social and racial inequities (37, 45.1%). Respondents reported gaining skills and knowledge in several aspects of civic engagement, including community organizing (67, 81.7%) and voting rights (63, 76.8%). The majority of respondents planned to incorporate voter registration into their future practice (76, 92.7%).

METHODS A prospective, case-controlled, intention-to-treat study with 56 patients was conducted between March 2016 and August 2017. Group A (24 patients) underwent conventional PD 14 days after catheter insertion. Group B (32 patients), underwent ESPD with APD. Exit site leak (ESL), catheter blockage, and peritonitis at 90 days were primary outcomes. Technique survival was secondary outcome. RESULTS Baseline characteristics were similar with 3 episodes of ESLs (9.4%) in the study group and none in the control group (p = 0.123). Catheter blockage (16.7%-Group A, 25%-Group B) and peritonitis (none vs. 9.4% in study group) were similar in terms of statistical details just as technique survival (95%-Group A, 88.2%-Group B at 90 days).

All patients were operated on using single-port surgery for small bowel exploration, lesion confirmation, small bowel resection and anastomosis. RESULTS Small bowel pathology was successfully detected by video capsule endoscopy in three of four patients, and was further substantiated by contrast CT, double-balloon endoscopy or enteroclysis. Complete small bowel exploration, intra-operative identification and oncological resection of the involved segment and anastomosis (intracorporeal and extracorporeal) was successfully performed in all five patients using single-port access without any complication, morbidity or mortality.

A systematic review and meta-analysis.,16.737938,9.25837,2018,"Influenza viruses and rhinoviruses are responsible for a large number of acute respiratory viral infections in human populations and are detected as copathogens within hosts. Clinical and epidemiological studies suggest that coinfection by rhinovirus and influenza virus may reduce disease severity and that they may also interfere with each other's spread within a host population. To determine how coinfection by these two unrelated respiratory viruses affects pathogenesis, we established a mouse model using a minor serogroup rhinovirus (rhinovirus strain 1B [RV1B]) and mouse-adapted influenza A virus (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 [PR8]). Infection of mice with RV1B 2 days before PR8 reduced the severity of infection by a low or medium, but not high, dose of PR8. Disease attenuation was associated with an early inflammatory response in the lungs and enhanced clearance of PR8. However, coinfection by RV1B did not reduce PR8 viral loads early in infection or inhibit replication of PR8 within respiratory epithelia or in vitro Inflammation in coinfected mice remained focal compared to diffuse inflammation and damage in the lungs of mice infected by PR8. The timing of RV1B coinfection was a critical determinant of protection, suggesting that sufficient time is needed to induce this response. Finally, disease attenuation was not unique to RV1B: dose-dependent coinfection by a murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus strain 1 [MHV-1]) also reduced the severity of PR8 infection. Unlike RV1B, coinfection with MHV-1 reduced early PR8 replication, which was associated with upregulation of beta interferon (IFN-β) expression. This model is critical for understanding the mechanisms responsible for influenza disease attenuation during coinfection by unrelated respiratory viruses.IMPORTANCE Viral infections in the respiratory tract can cause severe disease and are responsible for a majority of pediatric hospitalizations. Molecular diagnostics have revealed that approximately 20% of these patients are infected by more than one unrelated viral pathogen. To understand how viral coinfection affects disease severity, we inoculated mice with a mild viral pathogen (rhinovirus or murine coronavirus), followed 2 days later by a virulent viral pathogen (influenza A virus). This model demonstrated that rhinovirus can reduce the severity of influenza A virus, which corresponded with an early but controlled inflammatory response in the lungs and early clearance of influenza A virus. We further determined the dose and timing parameters that were important for effective disease attenuation and showed that influenza disease is also reduced by coinfection with a murine coronavirus. These findings demonstrate that coinfecting viruses can alter immune responses and pathogenesis in the respiratory tract.","Gonzalez, Andres J; Ijezie, Emmanuel C; Balemba, Onesmo B; Miura, Tanya A",Journal of virology,371,17

Using an augmented theory of planned behavior (TPB), incorporating threat perceptions alongside the rational decision-making components of the TPB, the current study sought to identify predictors of blood donors' intentions to donate during two phases of an avian influenza outbreak. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Blood donors (n = 172) completed an on-line survey assessing the standard TPB predictors as well as measures of threat perceptions from the health belief model (i.e., perceived susceptibility and severity). Path analyses examined the utility of the augmented TPB to predict donors' intentions to donate during a low- and high-risk phase of an avian influenza outbreak. RESULTS In both phases, the model provided a good fit to the data explaining 69% (low risk) and 72% (high risk) of the variance in intentions. Attitude, subjective norm, and perceived susceptibility significantly predicted donor intentions in both phases. Within the low-risk phase, sex was an additional significant predictor of intention, while in the high-risk phase, perceived behavioral control was significantly related to intentions. CONCLUSIONS An augmented TPB model can be used to predict donors' intentions to donate blood in a low-risk and a high-risk phase of an outbreak of avian influenza. As such, the results provide important insights into donors' decision-making that can be used by blood agencies to maintain the blood supply in the context of an avian influenza outbreak.","Masser, Barbara M; White, Katherine M; Hamilton, Kyra; McKimmie, Blake M",Transfusion,371,19

OBJECTIVE Study responses to a modified HCT, encompassing various body positions and light physical activity, reflecting relevant activities of children during flight, with a view to challenge the evidence of the current cut-off. METHODS Oxygenation, heart rate and ventilation were observed in 34 healthy schoolchildren (17 boys) undergoing a modified HCT, alternating between breathing room air and 15% oxygen in nitrogen while seated, supine, standing and walking at 3 km/h and 5 km/h. RESULTS Nadir SpO2 <90%, median (range), occurred in 9 subjects sitting, 89% (78-89%); 6 supine, 88.5% (87-89%); 9 standing, 89% (85-89%); 23 walking 3 km/h, 87% (74-89%); and 21 walking 5 km/h, 86% (74-89%). Total time <90% for these subjects in seconds was 20 (10-80) sitting, 30 (10-190) supine, 50 (10-150) standing, 80 (10-260) walking 3 km/h and 125 (10-300) walking 5 km/h. Light exercise in general led to lower SpO2: 91% (77-96%), p<0.0001. CONCLUSIONS A modified HCT led to moments of desaturation below 90% in various body positions at rest and during light physical activity in healthy schoolchildren.

We believe so. The purpose of proposed angiography-driven classification is to optimize description of the carotid artery from the endovascular perspective. A review of existing, predominantly surgically-driven classifications is performed, and a new scheme, based on the study of NYU aneurysm angiographic and cross-sectional databases is proposed. Seven segments - cervical, petrous, cavernous, paraophthlamic, posterior communicating, choroidal, and terminus - are named. This nomenclature recognizes intrinsic uncertainty in precise angiographic and cross-sectional localization of aneurysms adjacent to the dural rings, regarding all lesions distal to the cavernous segment as potentially intradural. Rather than subdividing various transitional, ophthalmic, and hypophyseal aneurysm subtypes, as necessitated by their varied surgical approaches and risks, the proposed classification emphasizes their common endovascular treatment features, while recognizing that many complex, trans-segmental, and fusiform aneurysms not readily classifiable into presently available, saccular aneurysm-driven schemes, are being increasingly addressed by endovascular means. We believe this classification may find utility in standardizing nomenclature for outcome tracking, treatment trials and physician communication.","Shapiro, M; Becske, T; Riina, H A; Raz, E; Zumofen, D; Jafar, J J; Huang, P P; Nelson, P K",AJNR.

METHODS We prospectively evaluated a single institution experience with minimally invasive partial nephrectomy between 2006 and 2010. The study cohort comprised 86 consecutively treated patients who underwent laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN, N = 59) or robotic-assisted (RPN, N = 27) partial nephrectomy by a single surgeon. RESULTS There was no difference between the LPN and RPN cohort in terms of gender, age, operative side, American Society of Anesthesiology score, or preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). An early unclamping technique was used for 22 (82%) patients in the RPN cohort and 6 (10%) patients in the LPN cohort. (P < 0.001). Warm ischemia time was lower in the RPN cohort (mean 18.5 vs. 28.0 min, P = <0.001) as result of majority undergoing early unclamping. There was no difference in operative time, estimated blood loss, length of stay, transfusion rate, positive surgical margin, or postoperative decrease in eGFR. There was no difference in mean eGFR decrease after early unclamping (16%) versus traditional clamping (22%); however, 11 (29%) patients had greater than 50% decrease in eGFR after traditional clamping versus 0 patients after early unclamping (P = 0.014). CONCLUSION Patients undergoing RPN during implementation of a robotic kidney surgery program when compared with LPN appear to have equivalent perioperative outcomes and oncologic efficacy. RPN patients had surgery later in our minimally invasive partial nephrectomy experience, and these results may not be generalizable to laparoscopic and/or robotic naïve surgeons.","Williams, Stephen B; Kacker, Ravi; Alemozaffar, Mehrdad; Francisco, Ignacio San; Mechaber, Jodi; Wagner, Andrew A",World journal of urology,371,1

We use both a mean-field approximation and Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the dynamics of the model. Information diffusion influences behavior change by allowing people to be aware of the disease and adopt self-protection and subsequently affects disease transmission by changing the actual infection rate. Results show that (a) awareness plays a central role in epidemic prevention, (b) a reasonable fraction of overreacting nodes are needed in epidemic prevention (c) the basic reproduction number R_{0} has different effects on epidemic outbreak for cases with and without asymptomatic infection, and (d) social influence on behavior change can remarkably decrease the epidemic outbreak size. This research indicates that the media and opinion leaders should not understate the transmissibility and severity of diseases to ensure that people become aware of the disease and adopt self-protection to protect themselves and the whole population.","Ye, Yang; Zhang, Qingpeng; Ruan, Zhongyuan; Cao, Zhidong; Xuan, Qi; Zeng, Daniel Dajun",Physical review.

In the last decade, there has been a rapid expansion of clinical experience using NIRS to monitor cerebral oxygenation, and there is some evidence that NIRS-guided brain protection protocols might lead to a reduction in perioperative neurologic complications after cardiac surgery. However, there are no data to support the wider application of NIRS during routine surgery under general anesthesia, and its application in brain injury, where it might be expected to have a key monitoring role, is undefined. Although increasingly sophisticated apparatuses, including broadband and time-resolved spectroscopy systems, provide insights into the potential of NIRS to measure regional cerebral oxygenation, hemodynamics, and metabolism in real-time, these innovations have yet to translate into effective monitor-guided brain protection treatment strategies.

Gastric motility assessment by EGG is a candidate for standard clinical procedure based on the quantification of parameters characteristic of gastric motility disorders. Despite its noticeable benefits, EGG is not widely implemented in clinical practice. The main reasons are: (1) lack of standardization of electrode placement, (2) time-consuming diagnostic procedures and (3) a complex multi-channel recording setup. We proposed a methodology in which an easy-to-use single-channel EGG, with a less time-consuming protocol (<1 h), would provide sufficient information for gastric motility assessment. Recordings from the three anatomical landmarks in 20 healthy young subjects were compared under two conditions, fasting and postprandial by evaluating the dominant frequency (DF). Our results showed that there is a statistically significant increase of DF after meal ingestion (p<0.05) in each of the three channels.

Cannabinoids are gaining acceptance for use as medicines in the treatment of insomnia disorder. OBJECTIVE We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of cannabinoids in the treatment of insomnia disorder. METHODS We performed a systematic review of the PubMed, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Complete databases from inception to 5 December 2019, and again prior to data abstraction, for studies of cannabis-based products for the treatment of insomnia disorder in adults. Inclusion criteria were (1) clinical studies, (2) participants aged ≥ 18 years, (3) insomnia disorder either formally diagnosed against contemporaneous diagnostic criteria or quantified with validated instruments and (4) compared cannabis-based products with the standard of care, placebo or a sedative. No language restrictions were imposed. Non-primary research, animal studies and studies of cannabis-induced insomnia were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 tool for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for non-randomized trials. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic. RESULTS A total of five studies (two RCTs and three non-randomised studies) with 219 study participants were included, of which three could be combined. The three non-randomised studies contributed data on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Questionnaire score, showing a favourable effect of cannabinoids at ≤ 4 weeks of follow-up (mean difference - 1.89 [95% confidence interval {CI} - 2.68 to - 1.10]; n = 176) and at 8 weeks of follow-up (mean difference - 2.41 [95% CI - 3.36 to - 1.46]; n = 166). One double-blind crossover RCT (n = 32) reported that, compared with amitriptyline, nabilone-a synthetic analogue to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-improved Insomnia Severity Index scores after 2 weeks of treatment (adjusted difference - 3.25 [95% CI - 5.26 to - 1.24]) and resulted in a more restful sleep as a sub-measure of the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ) (difference 0.48 [95% CI 0.01-0.95]) but with no effect on overall sleep quality as measured by the LSEQ. In a single ascending-dose RCT (n = 9), THC reduced sleep-onset latency compared with placebo at 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg doses (mean difference - 43.00 min [95% CI - 82.76 to - 3.24], - 62.00 [95% CI - 103.60 to - 20.40] and - 54.00 [95% CI - 103.93 to - 4.07], respectively). All the included studies were assessed as poor quality, mainly due to small sample sizes, short treatment periods, uncertain clinical significance and high risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS Few studies have examined the efficacy of cannabinoids in the treatment of insomnia disorder. Despite some possible signals for efficacy, the heterogeneity of participants, interventions, efficacy outcomes and results, and the high risk of bias across included trials, do not reliably inform evidence-based practice. This review highlights shortcomings in the existing literature, including lack of diagnostic clarity, poorly defined participant groups, non-standardised interventions and studies of inappropriate design, duration and power to detect clinically meaningful outcomes. Further research in the form of high-quality RCTs are required before drawing any conclusions about the efficacy of cannabinoids in the treatment of insomnia disorder.

This article aims to provide guidance for people conducting systematic reviews relevant to the healthcare of older people. An awareness of these issues will also help people reading systematic reviews to determine whether the results will influence their clinical practice. It is essential that systematic reviews are performed by a team which includes the required technical and clinical expertise. Those performing reviews for the first time should ensure they have appropriate training and support. They must be planned and performed in a transparent and methodologically robust way: guidelines are available. The protocol should be written-and if possible published-before starting the review. Geriatricians will be interested in a table of baseline characteristics, which will help to determine if the studied samples or populations are similar to their patients. Reviews of studies of older people should consider how they will manage issues such as different age cut-offs; non-specific presentations; multiple predictors and outcomes; potential biases and confounders. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses may provide evidence to improve older people's care, or determine where new evidence is required. Newer methodologies, such as meta-analyses of individual level data, network meta-analyses and umbrella reviews, and realist synthesis, may improve the reliability and clinical utility of systematic reviews.","Shenkin, Susan D; Harrison, Jennifer K; Wilkinson, Tim; Dodds, Richard M; Ioannidis, John P A",Age and ageing,371,11

We investigated if EGFR-activating mutation subtypes impact treatment outcomes in the phase 3 RELAY study. Associations between EGFR mutation type and pre-existing co-occurring and treatment-emergent genetic alterations were also explored. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Patients with metastatic NSCLC, an EGFR ex19del or ex21L858R mutation, and no central nervous system metastases were randomized (1:1) to erlotinib (150 mg/day) with either ramucirumab (10 mg/kg) (RAM+ERL) or placebo (PBO+ERL), every 2 weeks, until RECIST v1.1-defined progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survial (PFS). Secondary and exploratory endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), PFS2, time-to-chemotherapy (TTCT), safety, and next-generation sequencing analyses. RESULTS Patients with ex19del and ex21L858R mutations had similar clinical characteristics and co-mutational profiles. ne-year PFS rates for ex19del patients were 74% for RAM+ERL versus 54% for PBO+ERL; for ex21L858R rates were 70% (RAM+ERL) versus 47% (PBO+ERL). Similar treatment benefits (ORR, DOR, PFS2, and TTCT) were observed in RAM+ERL-treated patients with ex19del and ex21L858R. Baseline TP53 co-mutation was associated with superior outcomes for RAM+ERL in both ex19del and ex21L858R subgroups. EGFR T790M mutation rate at progression was similar between treatment arms and by mutation type. CONCLUSIONS RAM+ERL provided significant clinical benefit for both EGFR ex19del and ex21L858R NSCLC, supporting this regimen as suitable for patients with either of these EGFR mutation types.","Nakagawa, Kazuhiko; Nadal, Ernest; Garon, Edward B; Nishio, Makoto; Seto, Takashi; Yamamoto, Nobuyuki; Park, Keunchil; Shih, Jin-Yuan; Paz-Ares, Luis; Frimodt-Moller, Bente; Zimmermann, Annamaria H; Wijayawardana, Sameera; Visseren-Grul, Carla; Reck, Martin",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,371,1

Materials and Methods The samples were cultured and characterized using morphological and diagnostic biochemical tests. The analysis of the frequency of the isolates and their antibiotic resistance were calculated using SPSS (version 22) at a significant level of P-value < 0.05. Results Bacterial isolates were collected from the 1194 clinical specimens, of which 1394 were isolated from urine, 16 from CSF, and 588 from tracheal aspiration. Also, 654 (54.8%) isolates were obtained from females and 540 (45.2%) from males with the age range 15-73 years (P> 0.05). The results showed that 22.1% were gram-positive and 77.9% were gram-negative. In our study, the frequency of Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria was higher than in some studies, and this indicates the genetic changes and resistance of this bacterium to many antibiotics. Conclusion To prevent further spread of resistance, increase the effectiveness of antibiotics and prevent multidrug resistance, it is essential to establish a precise schedule for the use of antibiotics and assess the resistance pattern periodically in each region based on the antibiotic resistance pattern.","Nouri, Fatemeh; Karami, Pezhman; Zarei, Omid; Kosari, Faezeh; Alikhani, Mohammad Yousef; Zandkarimi, Eghbal; Rezazadeh Zarandi, Ebrahim; Taheri, Mohammad",Infection and drug resistance,371,2

CASE DESCRIPTION A 11-year old male patient with confirmed COVID-19 infection was hospitalized at the Pediatric Clinic Clinic of the IRCCS Foundation and Hospital San Matteo, Pavia, Italy. Three days after hospital admission, because of the patient complaining very mild ocular symptoms, an ophthalmological evaluation was performed. No signs related to conjunctivitis or keratitis were found but a conjunctival swab was collected as well, based on patient's medical history. The specific SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed, unearthing the presence of viral RNA from the swab.

However, challenges exist in obtaining the maximum yield from industrial fermentations. One challenge arises from the nature of alcohols. These compounds are chaotropic (i.e. causes disorder in the system) which causes stress in the microbes producing the biofuel. Brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) typically cannot grow at ethanol concentration much above 17% (v/v). Mitigation of these properties has the potential to increase yield. Previously, we have explored the effects of chaotropes on model enzyme systems and attempted (largely unsuccessfully) to offset these effects by kosmotropes (compounds which increase the order of the system, i.e. the ""opposite"" of chaotropes). Here we present some theoretical results which suggest that high molecular mass polyethylene glycols may be the most effective kosmotropic additives in terms of both efficacy and cost. The assumptions and limitations of these calculations are also presented. A deeper understanding of the effects of chaotropes on biofuel-producing microbes is likely to inform improvements in bioethanol yields and enable more rational approaches to the ""neutralisation"" of chaotropicity.","Timson, David J; Eardley, Joshua",Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,371,1

With the introduction of new treatment classes, it is important to examine patient symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at the start of this changing therapeutic landscape. This real-world study describes the patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer receiving ET-based regimens who were naïve to systemic treatment in the advanced setting across five European countries (EU5). METHODS Data were collected between March and July 2017 from surveyed oncologists and their patients at a single time point using the multinational Adelphi Advanced Breast Cancer Disease Specific Programme™. Patients completed PRO questionnaires on HRQoL (EORTC QLQ-C30), pain severity and interference, and work and activity impairment. A multiple linear regression model explored factors associated with HRQoL. RESULTS Across EU5, 226 physicians provided data on 781 women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer taking their first ET-based regimen for advanced disease, of whom 252 provided PRO data. This subset had a mean age of 67.1 years, 94% were postmenopausal, 89% were diagnosed with advanced breast cancer at initial presentation, 79% had stage IV disease (66% of these patients had bone metastases and 38% had visceral metastases, including 18% with liver metastases) and 77% were on endocrine-only therapy as their initial treatment for advanced disease. The mean EORTC QLQ-C30 global health score (50.9) was worse than the reference value for patients with advanced breast cancer (60.2). Fatigue, pain, and insomnia were the most severe symptoms, and mean functioning scores were also worse than reference values. ""Worst pain"" and ""pain interference"" were moderate/severe for 42 and 80% of patients. Mean activity impairment was 44%, and greater activity impairment was associated with poorer HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS Despite receiving first-line ET-based regimens for advanced disease, these women had a poor HRQoL and high levels of symptoms, pain, pain interference and activity impairment. New treatments that maintain a stable disease state and reduce activity impairment may have a positive effect on the HRQoL of those living with advanced breast cancer.","Davie, Alison; Carter, Gebra Cuyun; Rider, Alex; Pike, James; Lewis, Katie; Bailey, Abigail; Price, Gregory L; Ringeisen, Francois; Pivot, Xavier",BMC cancer,371,1

In this study, we compared a new indicator-guided puncture technique (PCK) with standard surgical technique (ST) regarding success rate, performance time and complications. METHODS Cricothyroidotomy in 30 human cadavers performed by 30 first year anaesthesia residents. The set chosen for use was randomised: PCK-technique (n=15) and ST (n=15). Success rates, insertion times and complications were compared. Traumatic lesions were anatomically confirmed after dissection. RESULTS The ST-group had a higher success rate (100% vs 67%; p=0.04). There was no difference in time taken to complete the procedure (PCK 82 s. vs ST 95 s.; p=0.89). There was a higher complication rate in the PCK-group (67% vs 13%; p=0.04). Most frequent complication in the PCK-group was injury to the posterior tracheal wall (n=8), penetration to the oesophageal lumen (n=4) and injury to the thyroid and/or cricoid cartilage (n=5). In the ST-group in only 2 cases minor complications were observed (small vessel injury). CONCLUSIONS In this human cadaver study the PCK technique produced more major complications and more failures than the ST. In the hand of the inexperienced operator the standard surgical approach seems to be a safe procedure, which can successfully be performed within an adequate time. The PCK technique cannot be recommended for inexperienced operators.","Helm, Matthias; Hossfeld, Björn; Jost, Christian; Lampl, Lorenz; Böckers, Tobias",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,371,28

METHODS Patients with low risk of glaucoma progression were followed up at GLOC. Visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and visual field testing or optic nerve head imaging were assessed by nurses and technicians, with virtual review of data by an ophthalmologist separately. The implementation outcomes were defined as patient satisfaction, assessed by a nurse-administered questionnaire; the rate of referrals back to the glaucoma outpatient department; the patients' journey time (minutes); the time taken for the specialist review (minutes), and the per capita manpower cost compared with current glaucoma outpatient model. RESULTS A total of 377 patients were included, with the majority being glaucoma disc suspects (n = 250, 66.4%) and primary angle closure suspects (n = 54, 14.3%). Most patients (more than 90%) reported being satisfied, and only 7.7% (n = 29) were referred back to the specialist outpatient glaucoma clinic due to possible glaucoma progression. Compared with the glaucoma outpatient clinic, the average journey time in GLOC was 50% less (59.3 mins vs 132 mins), the average time for a specialist review was 3 times faster (5.8 mins vs 19.5 mins), and the per capita manpower cost of GLOC was halved ($20.07 vs $39.78). CONCLUSIONS GLOC is a time-efficient, cost-saving, and sustainable model of care for managing patients with low risk of glaucoma progression.

METHODS We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to May 2017 for randomized controlled trials comparing permissive hypotension vs. conventional resuscitation following traumatic injury. We included preoperative and intraoperative resuscitation strategies. The primary outcome was 30-day or in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included blood product utilization, estimated blood loss and in-hospital complications. Pooling was performed with a random-effects model. RESULTS We screened 722 abstracts, from which five randomized trials evaluating 1,158 patients were included. Blood pressure targets in the intervention arms varied from systolic BP 50 mm Hg to 70 mm Hg or mean arterial pressure of 50 mm Hg or higher as compared to systolic BP 65 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg or mean arterial pressure of 65 or higher in the control arms.

Four trials suggested a survival benefit for 30-day or in-hospital mortality with hypotensive resuscitation, although three studies were insufficiently powered to find statistical significance. Studies were of poor to moderate quality due to poor protocol reporting and lack of blinding. The pooled odds ratio was 0.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.92), suggesting a survival benefit for permissive hypotension. Those patients received fewer blood products and had lesser estimated blood loss. CONCLUSION Permissive hypotension may offer a survival benefit over conventional resuscitation for patients with hemorrhagic injury. It may additionally reduce blood loss and blood product utilization. However, the majority of studies were underpowered, thus reflecting a need for high quality, adequately powered trials.

Tolerability of this procedure, aimed at treatment of benign conditions, is fundamental. In this study, we evaluated if local anesthesia should be enough to reduce both hospital costs and sedation-related risks for the patient, avoiding deep sedation and presence of the anesthesiologist. From July 2017 to August 2018, 14 consecutive patients (mean age 60.1 years) were treated and divided in two groups: Group A (7 patients) underwent systemic sedoanalgesia (intravenous remifentanil/fentanyl ± intravenous midazolam ± intravenous acetaminophen/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) + subcutaneous anesthesia (lidocaine), with anesthesiologist. Group B (7 patients) underwent mild systemic sedoanalgesia (oral solution morphine sulfate + intravenous midazolam + intravenous acetaminophen) + both subcutaneous and subcapsular anesthesia (mepivacaine + bupivacaine), without anesthesiologist. Tolerability, sedation grade (Ramsay scale), total opioid dose, complications, and results at 12 months were analyzed and compared. Mean tolerability was 9.4 in group A and 8.9 in group B (p: 0.786). Mean sedation grade was 3.86 in group A and 2.71 in group B (p: 0.016). Mean total opioid dose was 70.9 mg in group A and 10 mg in group B (p:0.00015). No complications were observed. At 12 months, mean volume reduction was 56.1% in the group A and 60% in the group B. In thyroid radiofrequency ablation, subcapsular anesthesia can decrease both total opioid dose and level of patient's sedation without significant differences in tolerability, allowing to perform ablation without the anesthesiologist.","Morelli, F; Ierardi, A M; Biondetti, P; Zannoni, S; Pompili, G; Sacrini, A; Coppola, A; Rodà, G; Angileri, S A; Carrafiello, G",Medical oncology,371,31

However, existing rule-based approaches require tedious manual specifications of visualization rules by visualization experts. Other machine learning-based approaches often work like black-box and are difficult to understand why a specific visualization is recommended, limiting the wider adoption of these approaches. This paper fills the gap by presenting KG4Vis, a knowledge graph (KG)-based approach for visualization recommendation. It does not require manual specifications of visualization rules and can also guarantee good explainability. Specifically, we propose a framework for building knowledge graphs, consisting of three types of entities (i.e., data features, data columns and visualization design choices) and the relations between them, to model the mapping rules between data and effective visualizations. A TransE-based embedding technique is employed to learn the embeddings of both entities and relations of the knowledge graph from existing dataset-visualization pairs. Such embeddings intrinsically model the desirable visualization rules. Then, given a new dataset, effective visualizations can be inferred from the knowledge graph with semantically meaningful rules. We conducted extensive evaluations to assess the proposed approach, including quantitative comparisons, case studies and expert interviews. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","Li, Haotian; Wang, Yong; Zhang, Songheng; Song, Yangqiu; Qu, Huamin",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,371,1

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) act together to control the proteolysis of extracellular matrix. Disbalances in the MMP/TIMP system during virally induced neurodegenerative processes and inflammations are responsive to changes in the progression of diseases. METHODS The expression of MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-3 in JEV-infected mouse brain was analyzed by RT-PCR for semiquantitation and ELISA for estimation of protein along with brain histopathology at different days postinoculation (dpi). Gelatin gel zymography was performed for MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities. RESULTS In the virus-infected group, expression of MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-3 was found to be increased from 1 dpi to 6 dpi as compared to controls by both RT-PCR and ELISA. The expressions of MMPs and TIMPs at mRNA and protein levels were in concordance with each other. Post hoc multiple comparison analysis between days revealed that, in the virus-infected groups, significant increases (p < 0.05) in MMP and TIMP levels were observed between various dpi at both mRNA and protein levels. Only the MMP-7 protein level at 6 dpi was not significant compared to 5 dpi (p = 0.99). CONCLUSION Overexpression of MMPs and TIMPs is associated with disease severity in the central nervous system (CNS) during JEV infection. Our results showed that JEV infection can alter the expression of MMPs and TIMPs in the CNS. Thus, assessing these important immune mediators in CNS infection appears to play an important role in the development of symptoms and may help to understand the JEV-induced neurological disorders. More studies are required on this important enzymatic system to study their role in immune mediated pathogenesis.","Shukla, Vibha; Kumar Shakya, Akhalesh; Dhole, T N; Misra, Usha Kant",Neuroimmunomodulation,371,1

Its prevalence is highest in older populations. Yet, this group has received little attention in many African countries. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration: CRD42017056474) to estimate the prevalence of hypertension in older adults living in Africa. METHODS We searched grey literature and major electronic databases including PubMed and Embase for population-based studies and published between 1 January 1980 to 28 May 2018 reporting the prevalence of hypertension for adults aged ≥50 years living in Africa. We employed a random effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence across included studies. FINDINGS We screened 10,719 articles and retrieved 103 full-text articles to evaluate for inclusion in the review. Thirty-four unique studies providing 37 data points on 43,025 individuals in 15 African countries were analyzed. The prevalence of hypertension ranged from 22.3% to 90.0% from the individual studies while the overall pooled prevalence was 57.0% (95% CI 52%-61%). The prevalence was not statistically significantly different by sex, residence, or African sub-region. In individual studies, older age and overweight/obesity were independently associated with hypertension. Twenty-nine (78%) data points were deemed to be of low- or moderate-risk of bias. Eliminating high-risk bias studies made little difference to the pooled estimate of hypertension. Sensitivity analyses, omitting one study at a time, identified three studies with significant but relatively small impact on the pooled estimate. We observed substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 98.9%) across the studies which was further explored by meta-regression analyses. Overall, the GRADE assessment suggested moderate quality evidence in the results. CONCLUSION The persistent high prevalence of hypertension among older adults in Africa, even in rural populations warrants more attention to the cardiovascular health of this group by public health authorities.","Bosu, William Kofi; Reilly, Siobhan Theresa; Aheto, Justice Moses Kwaku; Zucchelli, Eugenio",PloS one,371,1

To our knowledge, only one study has evaluated changes on the lateral radiograph and no study has evaluated changes in rotation of the fifth metatarsal head postoperatively. In percutaneous bunionette correction using a burr for osteotomy, shortening of the fifth metatarsal and elevation of the metatarsal head are inevitable. Without fixation, there is also a possibility of rotational change to the metatarsal head. We measured parameters on anteroposterior and lateral weightbearing radiographs in 18 feet pre- and postoperatively. Rotation of the fifth metatarsal head was graded according to the medial tubercle location. We also evaluated angular change of the fifth metatarsal on weightbearing lateral radiographs. Percutaneous bunionette correction without fixation could achieve satisfactory clinical and radiographic results, with less complication, when compared with previously published outcomes of open and percutaneous surgery with fixation. In this surgical method, bunionette is corrected in 3 dimensions.

Psychosocial stress also affects HRV and could be one of several confounders for cardiac AN. The present work investigated the impact of psychosocial stress on HRV in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and assessed the use of salivary cortisol as a biomarker for psychosocial stress in this context. METHODS A total of 167 individuals 6-60 years old (113 with T1DM and 54 healthy controls) underwent 24-hr ECG recordings with HRV analysis. Salivary cortisol was sampled thrice during the registration day. Perceived psychosocial stress along with other factors of possible importance for the interpretation of HRV was documented in a diary. RESULTS Heart rate variability (high-frequency power during sleep) was reduced (p < .05) with older age, longer diabetes duration, higher mean glucose levels, physical inactivity, and perceived psychosocial stress. Salivary cortisol levels in the evening were increased (p < .05) in women in ovulation phase, in individuals with preceding hypoglycemia or with hyperglycemia. The amplitude of salivary cortisol was reduced (p < .05) with the presence of perceived psychosocial stress, but only in adult healthy controls, not in individuals with diabetes. CONCLUSION Psychosocial stress might be a confounder for reduced HRV when diagnosing cardiac AN in T1DM. Salivary cortisol is, however, not a useful biomarker for psychosocial stress in diabetes since the physiological stress of both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia seems to overrule the effect of psychosocial stress on cortisol.","Kristiansen, Eva; Wanby, Pär; Åkesson, Karin; Blomstrand, Peter; Brudin, Lars; Thegerström, Johanna","Annals of noninvasive electrocardiology : the official journal of the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrocardiology, Inc",371,1

In this study, we observed that human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were susceptible to infection with PEDV vaccine strain CV777 (G1 subtype) and field isolate LNCT2 (G2 subtype). The one-step growth curve showed that the growth dynamics of PEDV in HEK293 cells was similar to that observed in Vero cells. Furthermore, we revealed that aminopeptidase N was involved in PEDV infection in HEK293 cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that HEK293 cells can be efficiently infected by PEDV, which might provide a useful tool for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of PEDV infection in vitro.","Zhang, Jian; Guo, Longjun; Xu, Yunfei; Yang, Lijun; Shi, Hongyan; Feng, Li; Wang, Yue",Archives of virology,371,17

The non-relapse mortality-J (NRM-J) index using the sum of these scores was then applied to patients in the validation set, resulting in a clear differentiation of non-relapse mortality, with expected 2-year rates of 11%, 16%, 27%, and 33%, respectively (P < 0.001).

MEASUREMENTS Systematic search of Medline, Cinahl, PsychINFO, Academic Search Complete, Psychological and Behavioural Sciences Collection, SocIndex and Social Sciences FT were conducted. Records screened by two reviewers against agreed inclusion criteria. Mixed studies (qualitative and quantitative) were synthesized within overarching themes. RESULTS Eighteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Synthesized data showed PCPs have mixed feelings on the appropriateness of their role in FtD assessments, with many feeling particularly uncomfortable and lacking confidence in the context of possible cognitive impairment. Reasons include lack of familiarity with legal requirements and local resources; fear of damaging the doctor-patient relationship; and impact on the patient's quality of life. Patients voiced their desire to maintain agency in planning their driving cessation. Studies evaluating pragmatic educational programmes suggest these can improve physician confidence in FtD consultations. CONCLUSION The increasing number of older people affected by cognitive impairment, for whom driving may be a concern, has implications for primary care practice. Addressing the reasons for PCPs lack of comfort in dealing with this issue is essential in order for them to better engage in, collaborative discussion with patients on plans and preferences for driving cessation.","Sinnott, Carol; Foley, Tony; Forsyth, Justin; McLoughlin, Kathleen; Horgan, Linda; Bradley, Colin P",PloS one,371,16

Rs678849, an intronic variant in the delta-opioid receptor gene (OPRD1), has been found to predict regional brain volume, addiction risk, and the efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone in treating opioid use disorder. The variant has also been implicated as an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for several genes. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to identify functional differences between the two alleles of rs678849 in vitro. We hypothesized that the two alleles of rs678849 would have different effects on transcriptional activity due to differential interactions with transcription factors. METHODS 15bp regions containing the C or T alleles of rs678849 were cloned into luciferase constructs and transfected into BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells to test the effect on transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using nuclear lysates from BE(2)C cell or human postmortem medial prefrontal cortex were used to identify proteins that differentially bound the two alleles. RESULTS At 24 hours post-transfection, the C allele construct had significantly lower luciferase expression than the T allele construct and empty vector control (ANOVA p < .001). Proteomic analysis and supershift assays identified XRCC6 as a transcription factor specifically binding the C allele, whereas hnRNP D0 was found to specifically bind the T allele. CONCLUSION These functional differences between the C and T alleles may help explain the psychiatric and neurological phenotype differences predicted by rs678849 genotype and the potential role of the variant as an eQTL.","Crist, Richard C; Arauco-Shapiro, Gabriella; Zhang, Alexander; Reiner, Benjamin C; Berrettini, Wade H; Doyle, Glenn A",The American journal of drug and alcohol abuse,371,1

Here, we report the results of the arm in which olaparib was combined with the orally bioavailable ataxia telangiectasia and RAD3-related inhibitor ceralasertib in patients with relapsed or refractory cancers harboring DNA damage response and repair alterations, including patients with BRCA-mutated PARP inhibitor-resistant high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). PATIENTS AND METHODS Germline and somatic mutations had to be deleterious by COSMIC or ClinVar for eligibility. Olaparib was administered at 300 mg twice daily and ceralasertib at 160 mg daily on days 1-7 in 28-day cycles until progression or unacceptable toxicities. Primary end points were confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) rates and clinical benefit rate (CBR; CR + PR + stable disease [SD] at 16 weeks). RESULTS Twenty-five patients were enrolled, with median four prior therapies. Five patients required dose reductions for myelosuppression. Overall response rate was 8.3% and CBR was 62.5% among the entire cohort. Two of five patients with tumor harboring ATM mutation achieved CR or SD ongoing at 24+ months, respectively (CBR 40%). Of seven patients with PARP inhibitor-resistant HGSOC, one achieved PR (-90%) and five had SD ranging 16-72 weeks (CBR 86%). CONCLUSION Olaparib with ceralasertib demonstrated preliminary activity in ATM-mutated tumors and in PARP inhibitor-resistant BRCA1/2-mutated HGSOC.

METHODS We conducted a retrospective, descriptive longitudinal study from March to July 2020 by analyzing data of all confirmed cases of COVID-19 among ED visitors and healthcare workers in King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz University Hospital. RESULTS During the study period, a total of 1,182 swab samples were collected for testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), of which 285 (24.1%) tested positive. Of the 285 cases of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 18 were healthcare workers and 267 were patients. As a result of using the respiratory pathway for COVID-19 patients, the hospital managed to limit transmission of SARS-CoV-2 not only between patients but also between patients and healthcare workers, while also containing the pandemic. There were no cases of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection recorded among the patients who visited the ED or the flu clinic.

The advantages of this technique are that it is less invasive than conventional open surgery and it permits single-stage management; however, other technical difficulties limit its use. The aim of this article is to introduce our novel technique for LCBDE, which may overcome some of the limitations of conventional LCBDE. Since December 2013, ten patients have undergone LCBDE using a V-shaped choledochotomy (V-CBD). After the confluence of the cystic duct and the CBD were exposed, a V-shaped incision was made along the medial wall of the cystic duct and the lateral wall of the common hepatic duct, which comprise two sides of Calot's triangle. The choledochoscope was inserted into the lumen of the CBD through a V-shaped incision, and all CBD stones were retrieved using a basket or a Fogarty balloon catheter or were irrigated with saline. After CBD clearance was confirmed using the choledochoscope, the choledochotomy was closed with the bard absorbable suture material known as V-loc. RESULTS The diameter of the CBD ranged from 8 to 30 mm, and the mean size of the stones was 11.6 ± 8.4 mm. The mean operative time was 97.8 ± 30.3 min, and the mean length of the postoperative hospital stay was 6.0 ± 4.6 days. All patients recovered without any postoperative complications, except for one patient who developed postoperative pancreatitis. No conversions to laparotomy were observed, and there were no recurrent stones and no need of T-tube insertion. CONCLUSIONS This report suggests that our novel technique, known as V-CBD, may represent a feasible and straightforward procedure for treating choledocholithiasis, especially when the CBD is not dilated.","Kim, Eun Young; Lee, Soo Ho; Lee, Jun Suh; Hong, Tae Ho",BMC surgery,371,1

Not only are women twice as likely as men to develop PTSD, they experience different symptoms and comorbidities associated with PTSD. Yet the dearth of preclinical research on females leaves a notable gap in understanding the underlying neuropathology of this sex difference. METHODS Using two standard measures of PTSD-like responses in rats, the acoustic startle response (ASR) and dexamethasone suppression test (DST), we tested the effects of traumatic stress in adult male and female rats using two rodent models of PTSD, single prolonged stress and predator exposure. We then examined the neural correlates underlying these responses with cFos and glucocorticoid receptor immunohistochemistry in brain regions implicated in the traumatic stress response. RESULTS We now report that adult male and female rats across two models of PTSD show consistent sex-specific responses that recapitulate fundamental differences of PTSD in men and women. Trauma-exposed males showed the well-established hyper-responsive phenotype of enhanced ASR and exaggerated negative feedback control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, while the same traumatic event had little effect on these same measures in females. Dramatic sex differences in how trauma affected cFos and glucocorticoid receptor expression in the brain lend further support to the idea that the trauma response of male and female rats is fundamentally different. CONCLUSIONS Two standard measures, ASR and DST, might suggest that females are resilient to the effects of traumatic stress, but other measures make it clear that females are not resilient, but simply respond differently to trauma. The next important question to answer is why. We conclude that males and females show fundamentally different responses to trauma that do not simply reflect differences in resilience. The divergent effects of trauma in the brains of males and females begin to shed light on the neurobiological underpinnings of these sex differences, paving the way for improved diagnostics and therapeutics that effectively treat both men and women.","Pooley, Apryl E; Benjamin, Rebecca C; Sreedhar, Susheela; Eagle, Andrew L; Robison, Alfred J; Mazei-Robison, Michelle S; Breedlove, S Marc; Jordan, Cynthia L",Biology of sex differences,371,16

We fabricated a regenerative scaffold comprising type I collagen and beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) nanoparticles. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) is a bioeffective signaling molecule that stimulates cell proliferation and wound healing. This study examined the effects, on bioactivity, of a nano-β-TCP/collagen scaffold loaded with FGF-2, particularly on periodontal tissue wound healing. MATERIAL AND METHODS Beta-tricalcium phosphate was pulverized into nanosize particles (84 nm) and was then dispersed. A nano-β-TCP scaffold was prepared by coating the surface of a collagen scaffold with a nanosize β-TCP dispersion. Scaffolds were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, compressive testing, cell seeding and rat subcutaneous implant testing. Then, nano-β-TCP scaffold, nano-β-TCP scaffold loaded with FGF-2 and noncoated collagen scaffold were implanted into a dog one-wall infrabony defect model. Histological observations were made at 10 d and 4 wk postsurgery. RESULTS Scanning electron microscopy images show that TCP nanoparticles were attached to collagen fibers. The nano-β-TCP scaffold showed higher compressive strength and cytocompatibility compared with the noncoated collagen scaffold. Rat subcutaneous implant tests showed that the DNA contents of infiltrating cells in the nano-β-TCP scaffold and the FGF-2-loaded scaffold were approximately 2.8-fold and 3.7-fold greater, respectively, than in the collagen scaffold. Histological samples from the periodontal defect model showed about five-fold greater periodontal tissue repair following implantation of the nano-β-TCP scaffold loaded with FGF-2 compared with the collagen scaffold. CONCLUSION The β-TCP nanoparticle coating strongly improved the collagen scaffold bioactivity. Nano-β-TCP scaffolds containing FGF-2 are anticipated for use in periodontal tissue engineering.","Ogawa, K; Miyaji, H; Kato, A; Kosen, Y; Momose, T; Yoshida, T; Nishida, E; Miyata, S; Murakami, S; Takita, H; Fugetsu, B; Sugaya, T; Kawanami, M",Journal of periodontal research,371,7

Exercise-induced feeling inventory and Stroop Color Word Test were performed at pre- and ~10-minute post-exercise, respectively. Bayes factors (BF10 ) quantified the evidence for or against the null. There were no changes or differences between conditions for interference control following exercise with or without blood flow restriction (Incongruent BF10 : 0.155; Stroop Interference BF10 : 0.082). There were also no differences in the error rate as well as no differences between conditions for changes in ""positivity"" or ""revitalization"". Feelings of ""tranquility"" were reduced relative to a control following exercise with [median δ (95% credible interval): -0.74 (-1.05, -0.45), BF10 : 5515.7] and without [median δ: -0.72 (-1.02, -0.41), BF10 : 571.3] blood flow restriction. These changes were not different between exercise conditions. Feelings of ""physical exhaustion"" were increased relative to a control following exercise without blood flow restriction [median δ: 0.35(0.09, 0.61), BF10 : 5.84]. However, this increase was not different from the same exercise with blood flow restriction. These results suggest that 1) isometric handgrip exercise could be performed without impairing interference control, even when blood flow restriction is added, and that 2) changes in feelings occur independent of changes in interference control.","Yamada, Yujiro; Song, Jun Seob; Bell, Zachary W; Wong, Vickie; Spitz, Robert W; Abe, Takashi; Loenneke, Jeremy P",Clinical physiology and functional imaging,371,16

In December 2014, the hyper-arid Evrona Nature Reserve, Israel, experienced large-scale contamination when crude oil spilled. The overarching goal of the study was to investigate the possible changes, caused by an accidental crude oil spill, in the leaf reflectance and biochemical composition of four natural habitat desert shrubs. The specific objectives were (1) to monitor the biochemical properties of dominant shrub species in the polluted and control areas; (2) to study the long-term consequences of the contamination; (3) to provide information that will assist in planning rehabilitation actions; and (4) to explore the feasibility of vegetation indices (VIs), along with the machine learning (ML) technique, for detecting stressed shrubs based on the full spectral range. Four measurement campaigns were conducted in 2018 and 2019. Along with the various stress indicators, field spectral measurements were performed in the range of 350-2500 nm. A regression analysis to examine the relation of leaf reflectance to biochemical contents was carried out, to reveal the relevant wavelengths in which polluted and control plants differ. Vegetation indices applied in previous studies were found to be less sensitive for indirect detection of long-term oil contamination. A novel spectral index, based on indicative spectral bands, named the ""normalized blue-green stress index"" (NBGSI), was established. The NBGSI distinguished significantly between shrubs located in the polluted and in the control areas. The NBGSI showed a strong linear correlation with pheophytin a. Machine learning classification algorithms obtained high overall prediction accuracy in distinguishing between shrubs located in the oil-polluted and the control sites, indicating internal component differences. The findings of this study demonstrate the efficacy of indirect and non-destructive spectral tools for detecting and monitoring oil pollution stress in shrubs.","Ignat, Timea; De Falco, Natalie; Berger-Tal, Reut; Rachmilevitch, Shimon; Karnieli, Arnon",Environmental pollution,371,1

Here, we report our finding that even in a molecule with D and A not resolvable, CT can be induced by electronic state mixing (ESM) in a symmetric multi-chromophore system (MCS), namely 1,4-di(1-pyrenyl)benzene (Py-Benz-Py). Unlike Py and Py-Benz, Py-Benz-Py exhibits unique photophysical properties attributable to the reduction of the energy gap between two electronic states induced by ESM. The ESM for Py-Benz-Py is due to the extended π-conjugation owing to the further introduction of Py into Py-Benz, and consequently leads to the favorable intramolecular CT, followed by the planarization due to the twisting motion between Py and phenyl moieties. Time-resolved spectroscopic data demonstrate that the twisting process of the Py moiety in acetonitrile occurs with two unequal time constants, suggesting the localized CT state and the asynchronous twisting dynamics of two Py moieties unlike the delocalized CT state in nonpolar and low-polarity solvents leading to the synchronous twisting of two Py moieties. This means that the symmetry-breaking CT in MCSs can induce an asynchronous twisting motion. The results reported here support that a molecule without CT can be turned into another molecule with CT induced by ESM and demonstrate that the excited-state relaxation dynamics can be regulated through the ESM induced by introducing the substituents or changing the environmental factors such as solvent polarities.","Kim, Siin; Ahn, Doo-Sik; Ahn, Mina; Wee, Kyung-Ryang; Choi, Jungkweon; Ihee, Hyotcherl",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,371,1

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and prognostication of monocyte distribution width (MDW) in sepsis for patients admitted to ICU. METHODS Between January and June 2020, we conducted a prospective observational study during the hospitalization of 506 adult patients admitted to the ICU. MDW was evaluated in 2,367 consecutive samples received for routine complete blood counts (CBC) performed once a day and every day during the study. Sepsis was diagnosed according to Sepsis-3 criteria and patients enrolled were classified in the following groups: no sepsis, sepsis and septic shock. RESULTS MDW values were significantly higher in patients with sepsis or septic shock in comparison to those within the no sepsis group [median 26.23 (IQR: 23.48-29.83); 28.97 (IQR: 21.27-37.21); 21.99 (IQR: 19.86-24.36) respectively]. ROC analysis demonstrated that AUC is 0.785 with a sensitivity of 66.88% and specificity of 77.79% at a cut-off point of 24.63. In patients that developed an ICU-acquired sepsis MDW showed an increase from 21.33 [median (IQR: 19.47-21.72)] to 29.19 [median (IQR: 27.46-31.47)]. MDW increase is not affected by the aetiology of sepsis, even in patients with COVID-19.

This review investigated evidence of breastfeeding transmission from ZIKV-infected mothers to their children and the presence of ZIKV infection in breastfeeding-related fluids. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We conducted a systematic review of observational studies, case studies, and surveillance reports involving breastfeeding women with ZIKV infection in several international databases. Data extraction and analysis were conducted following a PROSPERO-registered protocol. From 472 non-duplicate records, two case reports met criteria for inclusion. We reviewed three cases of ZIKV infection among lactating mothers near the time of delivery. Two of the three (2/3) associated newborns had evidence of ZIKV infection. ZIKV was detected in breast milk of all three mothers. Breast milk detection results were positive in all mothers (3/3) by RT-PCR, one was positive by culture (1/3), and none was tested for ZIKV-specific antibodies. Serum samples were ZIKV positive in all mothers (3/3), and sweat was not tested for ZIKV. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE We describe three cases of ZIKV-infected breastfeeding mothers who were symptomatic within three days of delivery, and two cases with ZIKV-infected newborns. While ZIKV was detected in the breast milk of all three mothers, the data are not sufficient to conclude ZIKV transmission via breastfeeding. More evidence is needed to distinguish breastfeeding transmission from other perinatal transmission routes.","Colt, Susannah; Garcia-Casal, Maria N; Peña-Rosas, Juan Pablo; Finkelstein, Julia L; Rayco-Solon, Pura; Weise Prinzo, Zita C; Mehta, Saurabh",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,371,25

Substantial economic losses also affect shellfish growers during PSP events. The toxins responsible for PSP are produced by dinoflagellates in the genus Alexandrium. Despite the persistent threat posed by PSP and the long history of shellfish toxicity research, there is still confusion concerning the Alexandrium species that cause PSP in Alaska. The primary objective of this study was to identify the toxic Alexandrium species present in Alaska and to develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for use in screening phytoplankton and sediment samples. Before developing the PCR assays for this study, we evaluated published assays and many were not adequate because of primer dimer formation or because of cross-reactivity. Rather than continue to grapple with the uncertainty and inadequacy of published assays, we developed new assays for the Alexandrium species most likely to be present in Alaska. Only Alexandrium fundyense Group I and A. ostenfeldii were identified from four sampling regions from southeast Alaska to Kodiak Island, indicating that these two species are widely distributed. PCR assays for these two species were converted to quantitative (q)PCR format for use in monitoring programs. During the course of this study, we realized that a systematic evaluation of all published (~150) Alexandrium species-specific assays would be of benefit. Toward this objective, we collated published Alexandrium PCR, qPCR, and in situ hybridization assay primers and probes that targeted the small-subunit (SSU), internal transcribed spacer (ITS/5.8S), or D1-D3 large-subunit (LSU) (SSU/ITS/LSU) ribosomal DNA genes. Each individual primer or probe was screened against the GenBank database and Alexandrium gene sequence alignments constructed as part of this study.

However, due to their small size they are rapidly cleared from circulation. Binding to serum proteins can be an effective approach to improve pharmacokinetic properties of short half-life molecules. Herein, we have investigated the Zag albumin-binding domain (ABD) derived from Streptococcus zooepidemicus as a novel strategy to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of therapeutic molecules. To validate our approach, the Zag ABD was fused with an anti-TNFα single-domain antibody (sdAb). Our results demonstrated that the sdAb-Zag fusion protein was highly expressed and specifically recognizes human, rat and mouse serum albumins with affinities in the nanomolar range. Moreover, data also demonstrated that the sdAb activity against the therapeutic target (TNFα) was not affected when fused with Zag ABD. Importantly, the Zag ABD increased the sdAb half-life ∼39-fold (47min for sdAb versus 31h for sdAb-Zag). These findings demonstrate that the Zag ABD fusion is a promising approach to increase the half-life of small recombinant antibodies molecules without affecting their therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, the present study strongly suggests that the Zag ABD fusion strategy can be potentially used as a universal method to improve the pharmokinetics properties of many others therapeutics proteins and peptides in order to improve their dosing schedule and clinical effects.","Cantante, Cátia; Lourenço, Sara; Morais, Maurício; Leandro, João; Gano, Lurdes; Silva, Nuno; Leandro, Paula; Serrano, Mónica; Henriques, Adriano O; Andre, Ana; Cunha-Santos, Catarina; Fontes, Carlos; Correia, João D G; Aires-da-Silva, Frederico; Goncalves, Joao",Journal of biotechnology,371,32

A central feature of hosts is their population structure (e.g. spatial). Additionally, hosts themselves can exhibit different degrees of symptoms when newly infected; this latency is a key life-history property of pathogens. With an evolutionary-epidemiological model, we examine the role of population structure on the evolutionary dynamics of latency. We focus on specific power-law-like formulations for transmission and progression from the first infectious stage as a function of latency, assuming that the across-group to within-group transmission ratio increases if hosts are less symptomatic. We find that simple population heterogeneity can lead to local evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) at zero and infinite latency in situations where a unique ESS exists in the corresponding homogeneous case. Furthermore, there can exist more than one interior evolutionarily singular strategy. We find that this diversity of outcomes is due to the (possibly slight) advantage of across-group transmission for pathogens that produce fewer symptoms in a first infectious stage. Thus, our work reveals that allowing individuals without symptoms to travel can have important unintended evolutionary effects and is thus fundamentally problematic in view of the evolutionary dynamics of latency.","Saad-Roy, Chadi M; Grenfell, Bryan T; Levin, Simon A; van den Driessche, P; Wingreen, Ned S","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",371,1

However, the safety and efficacy of the technique for obtaining human olfactory epithelium are still not fully established. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of harvesting olfactory epithelium cells, nerve bundles, and olfactory epithelium proper for morphological analysis from the superior nasal septum. METHODS During nasal surgery, 22 individuals without olfactory complaints underwent olfactory epithelium biopsies from the superior nasal septum. The efficacy of obtaining olfactory epithelium, verification of intact olfactory epithelium and the presence of nerve bundles in biopsies were assessed using immunofluorescence. Safety for the olfactory function was tested psychophysically using both unilateral and bilateral tests before and 1 month after the operative procedure. RESULTS Olfactory epithelium was found in 59.1% of the subjects. Of the samples, 50% were of the quality necessary for morphological characterization and 90.9% had nerve bundles. There was no difference in the psychophysical scores obtained in the bilateral olfactory test (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test [UPSIT®]) between means before biopsy: 32.3 vs. postoperative: 32.5, p = 0.81. Also, no significant decrease occurred in unilateral testing (mean unilateral test scores 6 vs. 6.2, p = 0.46).

This review summarizes the latest literature and guidelines on HP while integrating some real-life conundrums. RECENT FINDINGS Advances in the understanding of the pathobiology of fibrotic HP and other progressive pulmonary fibrosis have changed how we approach the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial lung disease. Classifications now embrace distinguishing two clinical phenotypes: nonfibrotic and fibrotic HP because of distinct disease behavior and prognosis implications. International guidelines on HP were recently published and proposed a framework and algorithm to guide the diagnostic process. SUMMARY The diagnosis of HP relies on the integration of multiples domains: clinical assessment of exposure, imaging, bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocytosis and histopathological findings. These features are reviewed in multidisciplinary discussion and lead to an estimation of the degree of confidence for HP diagnosis. Further research is warranted to improve knowledge on the pathophysiology of HP and ultimately improve its diagnostic approaches.","Sharma, Ashutosh; Ferraro, Vincent; Renzoni, Elisabetta A; Morisset, Julie",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,371,17

PATIENTS AND METHODS In this prospective study, 22 patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia and 19 patients with non-COVID-19-related community-acquired pneumonia (CAP group) were studied while 12 healthy persons comprised the control group. Blood samples were collected on admission and analysed for serum levels of endotoxin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO1). Clinical courses regarding progression to severe respiratory failure (SRF) requiring mechanical ventilation were recorded. RESULTS Patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia and patients with CAP presented significantly higher serum endotoxin and ZO1 concentrations on admission as compared to healthy controls. There was no difference in endotoxin levels between patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia and patients with CAP. In patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia, serum endotoxin concentrations were positively correlated with C-reactive protein and ferritin values. There were no significant differences in serum endotoxin and ZO1 concentrations between patients with severe and not severe COVID-19-related pneumonia, nor between patients who developed SRF and those who did not Conclusion: Patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia present intestinal barrier dysfunction leading to systemic endotoxemia.

With the health measures of social distance, the COVID-19 pandemic forced a strong shift to remote education. With the challenge of delivering quality education through a computer screen, we validated and applied an online course model using active teaching tools for higher education. We incorporated published active-learning strategies into an online construct, with problem-based inquiry and design of inquiry research projects to serve as our core active learning tool. The gains related to students' science learning experiences and their attitudes toward science were assessed by applying questionnaires before, during, and after the course. The course counted on the participation of 83 students, most of them (60.8%) from postgraduate students. Our results show that engagement provided by active learning methods can improve performance both in hard and soft skills. Students' participation seems to be more relevant when activities require the interaction of information, prediction, and reasoning, such as open-ended questions and design of research projects. Therefore, our data show that, in pandemic, active learning tools benefit students and improve their critical thinking and their motivation and positive positioning in science.","Rossi, Izadora Volpato; de Lima, Jordana Dinorá; Sabatke, Bruna; Nunes, Maria Alice Ferreira; Ramirez, Graciela Evans; Ramirez, Marcel Ivan",Biochemistry and molecular biology education : a bimonthly publication of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,371,19

Variants of concern (VOC) carrying mutations in the RBD or other regions of S reduce the effectiveness of many nAbs and vaccines by evading neutralization. Therefore, therapies that are less susceptible to resistance are urgently needed. Here, we characterized the memory B-cell repertoire of COVID-19 convalescent donors and analyzed their RBD and non-RBD nAbs. We found that many of the non-RBD-targeting nAbs were specific to the N-terminal domain (NTD). Using neutralization assays with authentic SARS-CoV-2 and a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus carrying SARS-CoV-2 S protein (rVSV-SARS2), we defined a panel of potent RBD and NTD nAbs. Next, we used a combination of neutralization-escape rVSV-SARS2 mutants and a yeast display library of RBD mutants to map their epitopes. The most potent RBD nAb competed with hACE2 binding and targeted an epitope that includes residue F490. The most potent NTD nAb epitope included Y145, K150, and W152. As seen with some of the natural VOC, the neutralization potencies of COVID-19 convalescent-phase sera were reduced by 4- to 16-fold against rVSV-SARS2 bearing Y145D, K150E, or W152R spike mutations. Moreover, we found that combining RBD and NTD nAbs did not enhance their neutralization potential. Notably, the same combination of RBD and NTD nAbs limited the development of neutralization-escape mutants in vitro, suggesting such a strategy may have higher efficacy and utility for mitigating the emergence of VOC. IMPORTANCE The U.S. FDA has issued emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for multiple investigational monoclonal antibody (MAb) therapies for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. These MAb therapeutics are solely targeting the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. However, the N-terminal domain of the spike protein also carries crucial neutralizing epitopes. Here, we show that key mutations in the N-terminal domain can reduce the neutralizing capacity of convalescent-phase COVID-19 sera. We report that a combination of two neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor-binding and N-terminal domains may be beneficial to combat the emergence of virus variants.","Haslwanter, Denise; Dieterle, M Eugenia; Wec, Anna Z; O'Brien, Cecilia M; Sakharkar, Mrunal; Florez, Catalina; Tong, Karen; Rappazzo, C Garrett; Lasso, Gorka; Vergnolle, Olivia; Wirchnianski, Ariel S; Bortz, Robert H; Laudermilch, Ethan; Fels, J Maximilian; Mengotto, Amanda; Malonis, Ryan J; Georgiev, George I; Quiroz, Jose A; Wrapp, Daniel; Wang, Nianshuang; Dye, Kathryn E; Barnhill, Jason; Dye, John M; McLellan, Jason S; Daily, Johanna P; Lai, Jonathan R; Herbert, Andrew S; Walker, Laura M; Chandran, Kartik; Jangra, Rohit K",mBio,371,1

This investigative study was conducted to determine the AGIQ metabolite(s) responsible for the discoloration. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered dietary AGIQ at doses of 0%, 1.5%, 3.0%, or 5.0% (0, 1735.0, 3480.8, and 5873.7 mg/kg/day, respectively) for 14 days, followed by a 14- or 28-day recovery period. Measurements of quercetin in urine and quercetin, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, kaempferol, and 3-o-methylquercetin metabolites of AGIQ in bone (femur), white and brown fat, and cerebrum samples were conducted following the exposure period and each recovery period. Gross examination of the femur revealed yellow discoloration that increased in intensity with dose and was still present in a dose-related manner following both recovery periods. Quercetin, at levels correlating with AGIQ dose, was measured in the urine following the 14-day exposure period and, at lower concentrations, 14 or 28 days following cessation of AGIQ exposure. All four metabolites were present in a dose-dependent manner in the femur following 14 days of dietary exposure; only quercetin, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, and 3-o-methylquercetin were present during the recovery periods. Quercetin, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, and 3-o-methylquercetin were detected in white fat (along with kaempferol), brown fat (excluding quercetin due to analytical interference), and cerebrum samples, indicating systemic availability of the metabolites. Collectively, these data implicate quercetin, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, or 3-o-methylquercetin (or a combination thereof) as the most likely metabolite of AGIQ causing the yellow discoloration of bone in rats administered dietary AGIQ.","Davis, Jeffrey P; Koyanagi, Mihoko; Maronpot, Robert R; Recio, Leslie; Hayashi, Shim-Mo",Archives of toxicology,371,1

With the aim of evaluating clinical practice in specialized respiratory units, a Delphi consensus document was implemented on the use of single-inhaler fixed-dose triple therapies after 1 year of use in Spain. Methods A scientific committee of COPD experts defined a thematic index, guided a systematic literature review and helped design the Delphi questionnaire. This was sent to the other 45 COPD experts between April and June 2019. Agreement/disagreement on 58 statements was tested in two rounds using a Likert scale. Replies were classified as a consensus when ≥80% of the panelists agreed; a majority when a degree of agreement of ≥66% was reached; and divergence if agreement was <66%. Results After two rounds, 44.44% of the statements reached consensus, 14.81% reached majority and 40.74% were divergent. Panelists agreed that escalating from double bronchodilation should be phenotype-based and aim to prevent exacerbations but not for improving symptoms. The addition of an antimuscarinic to inhaled corticosteroids combinations achieves improvement in lung function, symptoms and exacerbation prevention. Main safety concerns included the increased risk of pneumonia as compared to bronchodilator therapies, with similar cardiovascular effects. There was no consensus agreement on patient type response based on blood eosinophil counts or obstruction severity. Conclusion The low degree of consensus among panelists may reflect the complexity of severe COPD management. The information provided here may be useful to clinicians implementing personalized medicine for COPD patients.","López-Campos, José Luis; Alcázar Navarrete, Bernardino; Riesco Miranda, Juan Antonio; Cosío, Borja G; de-Torres, Juan P; Celli, Bartolomé; Jiménez-Ruiz, Carlos A; Casanova Macario, Ciro",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,371,6

We conducted key informant interviews with homeless service providers and public health officials (n = 17) and identified challenges specific to the homeless population in the areas of communication, infection control, isolation and quarantine, and resource allocation. Planning for future outbreaks should take into account the need to (1) develop systems that enable rapid two-way communication between public health officials and homeless service providers, (2) ensure that homeless service providers have access to infection control supplies and staff training, (3) prepare for possible homeless shelter closures due to staff shortages or high attack rates among clients, and (4) plan for where and how clinically ill homeless individuals will be isolated and treated.

Considering the uncertainties surrounding BCG efficacy and the lower likelihood of TB exposure in low-incidence countries, most have discontinued mass vaccination, choosing instead a targeted vaccination strategy among high-risk groups. Given the increased risk of TB infection in Canadian Indigenous communities compared to the general Canadian population, these communities are a pertinent example of high-incidence groups in an otherwise low-burden country, warranting particular consideration regarding BCG vaccination strategy. This systematic review aims to synthesise and critically appraise the literature on BCG vaccination strategies in high-risk groups in low-incidence settings to provide policy considerations relevant to the Canadian Indigenous context. METHODS A literature search of the Medline and Embase databases was conducted, returning studies pertaining to BCG vaccine efficacy, TB incidence under specific vaccination policies, BCG-associated adverse events, and vaccination policy guidelines in low-burden countries. Study screening was tracked using the Covidence systematic review software (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia), and data pertaining to the above points of interest were extracted. RESULTS The final review included 49 studies, spanning 15 countries. Although almost all of these countries had implemented a form of mass or routine vaccination previously, 11 have since moved to targeted vaccination of selected risk groups, in most cases due to the low risk of infection among the general population and thus the high number of vaccinations needed to prevent one case in the context of low-incidence settings. Regarding identifying risk groups for targeted screening, community-based (rather than individual risk-factor-based) vaccination has been found to be beneficial in high-incidence communities within low-incidence countries, suggesting this approach may be beneficial in the Canadian Indigenous setting. CONCLUSIONS Community-based vaccination of high-incidence communities may be beneficial in the Canadian Indigenous context, however, where BCG vaccination is implemented, delivery strategies and potential barriers to achieving adequate coverage in this setting should be considered. Where an existing vaccination program is discontinued, it is crucial that an effective TB surveillance system is in place, and that case-finding, screening, and diagnostic efforts are strengthened in order to ensure adequate TB control. This is particularly relevant in Canadian Indigenous and other remote or under-served communities, where barriers to surveillance, screening, and diagnosis persist.","Faust, Lena; Schreiber, Yoko; Bocking, Natalie",BMC public health,371,16

The TransForm™ Occlusion Balloon Catheter (TOBC) registry is intended to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and efficiency of BACE using the TOBC. Method and Study Design The TOBC registry is a prospective multicenter registry trial. Seven sites in the USA and 1 site in Spain participated and enrolled 81 patients. Results The performance and safety of the TOBC was evaluated based on scoring for different variables. Scores were measured using a semiquantitative rating scale (1 = excellent, 5 = poor). The mean scores for these variables were as follows: visibility under fluoroscopy, 1.8; ability to reach the intended site, 1.6; stability during first positioning, 1.5; stability during inflation, 1.6; stability during deflation, 1.6; ability to temporarily stop flow, 1.6; and ability to assist in coil embolization, 1.7. The mean inflation and deflation times were 4.9 and 5.6 s, respectively. Complete obliteration of the aneurysm (Raymond class I) was achieved in 69.4% of the BACE cases. Thrombus formation occurred in 4/81 (4.8%) of the cases. In all cases, the thrombus resolved with medications, no patient suffered an infarction, and an underlying hypercoagulable state from subarachnoid hemorrhage was considered a contributing factor. Vessel rupture occurred in 1/81 (1.2%) of the cases, but was unrelated to TOBC use. Conclusion BACE using the TOBC is safe and effective.

We believe that the retroperitoneoscopic (RP) approach to nephrectomy is advantageous, as it avoids mobilization of intraperitoneal organs and provides direct access to the renal artery. Nonetheless, this approach is not as popular as the transperitoneal approach, likely because of the steeper learning curve. We believe that hand-assistance reduces the learning curve because of the tactile feedback and similarity to open surgery. METHODS Over a 4-year period, 133 HARP nephrectomies were performed, including 92 radical nephrectomies, 19 radical nephroureterectomies, 12 total nephrectomies, and 10 live donor nephrectomies. Mean patient age was 62 years and mean body mass index was 30; 42% of patients had abdominal scars. Our technique uses a 7-cm muscle-sparing Gibson incision for the hand-port with 2 endoscopic ports. RESULTS Mean operative time, including ureterectomy, was 109 minutes, with a mean operative blood loss of 167 mL. Average hospitalization was 3.8 days. Two cases (1.5%) required open conversion. The complication rate was limited to 3.8% for blood transfusion, 3.8% for cardiac issues, 1.5% for pulmonary embolism, 2.3% for wound infection, and 1.5% for urinary retention. CONCLUSIONS Based on our results, we conclude that HARP nephrectomy is safe and effective and can be expeditiously performed. It is a versatile approach that is applicable for both neoplastic and non-neoplastic indications. In addition, HARP provides a minimally invasive alternative to open conversion in difficult cases of simple nephrectomy.","Capolicchio, John-Paul; Saemi, Arash; Trotter, Samuel; Plante, Mark K",Urology,371,1

Vocal function was compared among the groups pre- and post-test; the therapeutic singing group showed statistically significant improvement in all vocal parameters: PEF, maximum phonation time, voice intensity (intensity), fundamental frequency (F0), jitter, shimmer, and noise-to harmonics ratio. The general singing group showed improvement only in F0, jitter, and noise-to harmonics ratio. The control group showed an overall reduction in all vocal functions, with a significant decrease in PEF and intensity, and a decrease in jitter and shimmer. Although singing is considered helpful for the voice health of the elderly, therapeutic singing, which involves posture correction and breathing exercises, is even more effective, thus proving to be a viable intervention for preventive voice care of the elderly.","Moon, Soyoung; Park, Jiwon; Yang, Sua",Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,371,16

METHODS Convenience sampling was used to recruit participants. Questionnaires were sent to clinical physicians in three top tertiary Grade-A teaching hospitals in China and six hundred and seventeen physicians participated in the survey. RESULTS (1) Common physician-nurse interactions were shift-change reports and provisional reports when needed, and interactions expected by physicians included face-to-face reports and communication via a phone or mobile device. (2) Most respondents believed that the need for information in physician-nurse interactions was high, information was moderately accurate and timely, and feedback regarding interaction time and satisfaction indicated that they were only average and required improvement. (3) Information needs in physician-nurse interactions differed significantly according to hospital category, role, workplace, and educational background (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS There was a considerable need for information within physician-nurse interactions, and the level of satisfaction with the information obtained was average; requirements for the improvement of communication differed between physicians and nurses because of differences in their characteristics. Currently, the use of information technology in physician-nurse communication was less common but was highly expected by physicians.","Wen, Dong; Guan, Pengcheng; Zhang, Xingting; Lei, Jianbo",Informatics for health & social care,371,1

In daily life, superficial injury to the gastric or duodenal mucosa occurs regularly but heals rapidly by a process called 'restitution'. Persistent injury to the gastroduodenal mucosa also occurs but initiates a regenerative lesion with specific wound healing mechanisms that attempt to repair barrier function. If not healed, these lesions can be the site of neoplasia development in a chronic inflammatory setting. This review summarizes the past year of advances in understanding mucosal repair in the gastroduodenal mucosa, which occurs as a defense mechanism against injury. RECENT FINDINGS Organoids are an emerging new tool that allows for the correlation of in vivo and in vitro models; organoids represent an important reductionist model to probe specific aspects of injury and repair mechanisms that are limited to epithelial cells. Additionally, proof-of-concept studies show that machine learning algorithms may ultimately assist with identifying novel, targetable pathways to pursue in therapeutic interventions. Gut-on-chip technology and single cell RNA-sequencing contributed to new understanding of gastroduodenal regenerative lesions after injury by identifying networks and interactions that are involved in the repair process. SUMMARY Recent updates provide new possibilities for identifying novel molecular targets for the treatment of acute and superficial mucosal injury, mucosal regeneration, and regenerative lesions in the gastrointestinal tract.","Hagen, Susan J",Current opinion in gastroenterology,371,31

METHODS This study includes participants who underwent sleeve gastrectomy and matched participants who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass from the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 (LABS-2) study. Adults undergoing initial bariatric surgical procedures between 2006 and 2009 were enrolled. Participants who underwent sleeve gastrectomy were high-risk or superobese and intended to have a second-stage procedure. Mixed models were used to evaluate percent weight change from baseline through 7 years, and diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension prevalence through 5 years. RESULTS Fifty-seven of 59 participants who underwent sleeve gastrectomy were matched one to one. Most were female (68%) and white (81%), and had a median age of 49 (37-56) years and median body mass index of 56.4 (35.5-76.8) kg/m2 presurgery. Weight loss was significantly less 1 to 7 years after sleeve gastrectomy versus matched Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (eg, year 7 mean weight loss was 23.6% vs 30.4%, respectively; P = .001). For both surgical groups, prevalence of diabetes, low high-density lipoprotein, and hypertension were significantly (P < .05) lower 5 years postsurgery versus baseline. CONCLUSION Higher-risk or super-obese participants after sleeve gastrectomy lost less weight than did matched Roux-en-Y gastric bypass counterparts throughout 7 years. Both groups exhibited improvements in comorbidities from presurgery through 5 years.","Ahmed, Bestoun; King, Wendy C; Gourash, William; Belle, Steven H; Hinerman, Amanda; Pomp, Alfons; Dakin, Greg; Courcoulas, Anita P",Surgery,371,31

The characterization of the dynamics and effects of mutations on fitness is therefore central to our understanding of evolution and to human health. This protocol describes how to implement two methods that we recently developed: mutation visualization (MV) and microfluidic mutation accumulation (µMA), which allow the occurrence of mutations created by DNA replication errors (MV) and the evolution of cell fitness during MA (µMA) to be followed directly in individual cells of Escherichia coli. MV provides a quantitative characterization of the dynamics of mutation occurrences, and µMA allows precise estimation of the distribution of fitness effects (DFEs) of mutations. Both methods use microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, and a fluorescent mismatch repair (MMR) MutL protein is used as a marker for nascent mutations. Here, we present a single protocol describing how to implement the MV and µMA methods, including detailed procedures for microfluidic setup installation, data acquisition and data analysis and interpretation. Using this procedure, the microfluidic setup installation can be completed within 1 d, and automated data acquisition takes 2-4 d.","Robert, Lydia; Ollion, Jean; Elez, Marina",Nature protocols,371,1

The controller was compared with manual target-controlled infusion. METHODS In a multicenter study, 196 surgical patients were randomly assigned to dual closed-loop or manual administration of propofol and remifentanil. Comparison between groups was evaluated by calculating a global score that characterized the overall performance of the controller including the percentage of adequate anesthesia, defined as BIS between 40 and 60, the median absolute performance error, and wobble. Secondary outcomes included occurrence of burst suppression ratio, time to tracheal extubation, and drug consumption. RESULTS Eighty-three patients assigned to dual-loop control and 84 patients assigned to manual control completed the study. The global score and the percentage of time with BIS between 40 and 60 were better in the dual-loop group (26 ± 11 vs 43 ± 40, P < 0.0001; 82% ± 12% vs 71% ± 19%, P < 0.0001). Overshoot (BIS <40), undershoot (BIS >60), and burst suppression ratio were all significantly less common in the dual-loop group. Modifications to the propofol and remifentanil infusions were more frequent, and adjustments smaller in the dual-loop group. Remifentanil consumption was greater (0.22 ± 0.07 vs 0.16 ± 0.07 μg · kg(-1) · min(-1); P < 0.0001) and the speed to tracheal extubation was shorter (10 ± 4 vs 11 ± 5 minutes; P = 0.02) in the dual-loop group. CONCLUSION The controller allows the automated delivery of propofol and remifentanil and maintains BIS values in predetermined boundaries during general anesthesia better than manual administration.","Liu, Ngai; Chazot, Thierry; Hamada, Sophie; Landais, Alain; Boichut, Nathalie; Dussaussoy, Corinne; Trillat, Bernard; Beydon, Laurent; Samain, Emmanuel; Sessler, Daniel I; Fischler, Marc",Anesthesia and analgesia,371,19

Swift development of various successful vaccines around the globe is striving to contain the exponential surges of COVID-19 cases. However, the ongoing struggle to vaccinate the global population and alarming spread of highly transmissible variants may thwart global initiatives to contain SARS-CoV-2 as observed by less robust protective immunity. METHODS In this perspective, we propose a thought-provoking, two-pronged strategy involving RNA interference approach to degrade essential SARS-CoV-2 ORFs required for replication and entry in conjunction with a complement inhibitor (compstatin) to stymie the detrimental proinflammatory cytokine storm that exacerbate disease progression and severity. RESULTS We provide supporting evidence suggesting that concurrent targeting of viral and host components will be a superior strategy to effectively suppress viral spread and clinical manifestations of COVID-19. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 specific RNAi in conjunction with systemic delivery of compstatin will be an effective two-pronged strategy to combat local and systemic immune responses in both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.","Naqvi, Raza Ali; Shukla, Deepak; Naqvi, Afsar R","Immunity, inflammation and disease",371,8

IL-18 regulates both T helper (Th) 1 and Th2 responses. It acts synergistically with IL-12 in the Th1 paradigm, whereas with IL-2 and without IL-12 it can induce Th2 cytokine production from cluster of differentation (CD)4+ T cells, natural killer (NK cells, NKT cells, as well as from Th1 cells. IL-18 also plays a role in the hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a life-threatening condition characterized by a cytokine storm that can be secondary to infections. IL-18-mediated inflammation was largely studied in animal models of bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal infections. These studies highlight the contribution of either IL-18 overproduction by the host or overresponsiveness of the host to IL-18 causing an exaggerated inflammatory burden and leading to tissue injury. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The damage in the later phase of the disease appears to be driven by a cytokine storm, including interleukin IL-1 family members and secondary cytokines like IL-6. IL-18 may participate in this hyperinflammation, as it was previously found to be able to cause injury in the lung tissue of infected animals. IL-18 blockade has become an appealing therapeutic target and has been tested in some IL-18-mediated rheumatic diseases and infantile-onset macrophage activation syndrome. Given its role in regulating the immune response to infections, IL-18 blockade might represent a therapeutic option for COVID-19, although further studies are warranted to investigate more in detail the exact role of IL-18 in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Vecchié, Alessandra; Bonaventura, Aldo; Toldo, Stefano; Dagna, Lorenzo; Dinarello, Charles A; Abbate, Antonio",Journal of cellular physiology,371,24

The purpose of this study was to perform a qualitative systematic review of outcomes in pediatric patients undergoing ECMO support pre- or post-abdominal organ transplantation. METHODS This was a systematic review conducted from Jan 1, 1989, to April 24, 2020, via PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov of all pediatric solid abdominal organ transplant recipients (pre- and post-transplant) and donors who underwent V-A or V-V ECMO cannulation. Death was the primary outcome, with graft function and complications as secondary outcomes. RESULTS Fourteen articles were identified that fit criteria, with 88% being case reports. Three patients were donors placed on ECMO, with no mortality among the 8 recipients of organs from these donors. Nineteen recipients were placed on ECMO. All were liver transplants. Most patients experienced at least one complication (84%), with bleeding as the most common cause (44%). Mortality was 26%. Causes of death included multiorgan system failure (n = 3), heart failure (n = 1), Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (n = 1), abdominal compartment syndrome (n = 3), bleeding (n = 1), septic shock from aspergillus (n = 1), and hepatic artery thrombosis (n = 2).

Ultrasound guidance for this procedure requires the use of transmission gel in proximity to the injection site, and its effect on maintaining sterility is unknown. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We asked: (1) Does sterile ultrasound transmission gel increase skin contamination during therapeutic orthopaedic injections? (2) Does nonsterile gel application result in increased contamination? (3) Does a manufacturer-approved ultrasound probe disinfecting agent in the form of 17.2% isopropanol and 0.28% diisobutylphenoxyethoxyethyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride wipes adequately decontaminate the ultrasound transducer? (4) Does 70% isopropyl alcohol effectively decontaminate skin for administration of musculoskeletal injections? METHODS Twenty-six healthy volunteers in an outpatient orthopaedic clinical setting were recruited. The subjects' skin was prepared to simulate a therapeutic intraarticular shoulder injection under ultrasound guidance. Four skin swabs for culture from each subject were taken: one sample before preparation with isopropyl alcohol, one sample after skin preparation, one after simulated injection procedure with sterile ultrasound transmission gel using the transducer, and one after mock procedure with nonsterile ultrasound transmission gel. In addition, samples were taken from the nonsterile ultrasound transmission gel and the transducer for culture analysis. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were incubated during a 5-day period for bacterial species identification. RESULTS Sterile ultrasound gel use results in an increase in skin contamination (odds ratio [OR], 9; 95% CI, 1.4-57.1; p=0.005). Compared with sterile gel use, application of nonsterile gel did not increase contamination proportion (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.7; p=0.56). All cultures from nonsterile gel were negative. None of the samples cultured directly from the ultrasound probe were positive for bacteria (0%). Skin preparation with 70% alcohol decreased the proportion of contamination when compared with unprepared skin (OR, 21.0; 95% CI, 3.1-142.2; p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS Use of ultrasound probes and transmission gel results in greater contamination in simulated intraarticular injections of the shoulder. As such, sterile preparation of the entire injection field, including the adjacent skin where the gel and probe are applied, may be prudent. Future studies are needed to determine if such a preparation decreases contamination and thereby infection rates related to musculoskeletal injections. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level II, therapeutic study.

Nowadays, in a world of continuous technological changes and scientific advances, there is a need for life-long learning and education within both formal and non-formal educational environments. In response to this challenge, the use of eye-tracking technology and data-mining techniques, respectively, for supervised (mainly prediction) and unsupervised (specifically cluster analysis) learning, provide methods for the detection of forms of learning among users and/or the classification of their learning styles. In this study, a protocol is proposed for the study of learning styles among adults with and without previous knowledge at different ages (18 to 69-year-old) and at different points throughout the learning process (start and end). Statistical analysis-of-variance techniques mean that differences may be detected between the participants by type of learner and previous knowledge of the task. Likewise, the use of unsupervised learning clustering techniques throws light on similar forms of learning among the participants across different groups. All these data will facilitate personalized proposals from the teacher for the presentation of each task at different points in the chain of information processing. It will likewise be easier for the teacher to adapt teaching materials to the learning needs of each student or group of students with similar characteristics.","Sáiz Manzanares, María Consuelo; Payo Hernanz, René Jesús; Zaparaín Yáñez, María José; Andrés López, Gonzalo; Marticorena Sánchez, Raúl; Calvo Rodríguez, Alberto; Martín, Caroline; Rodríguez Arribas, Sandra",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,371,5

We show that activation of Neu3 sialidase, also known as Neuraminidase-3, causing conversion of GD1a and GT1b to GM1 ganglioside, is an essential step in regeneration occurring in PNS (sensory) but not CNS (retinal) axons in adult rat. In PNS axons, axotomy activates Neu3 sialidase, increasing the ratio of GM1/GD1a and GM1/GT1b gangliosides immediately after injury in vitro and in vivo. No change in the GM1/GD1a ratio after axotomy was observed in retinal axons (in vitro and in vivo), despite the presence of Neu3 sialidase. Externally applied sialidase converted GD1a ganglioside to GM1 and rescued axon regeneration in CNS axons and in PNS axons after Neu3 sialidase blockade. Neu3 sialidase activation in DRGs is initiated by an influx of extracellular calcium, activating P38MAPK and then Neu3 sialidase. Ganglioside conversion by Neu3 sialidase further activates the ERK pathway.

Methods Data from various emergency events and details of the disease related to the incident were analysed using Cluster, Delphi and Decision analyses. The optimal drug combination was determined and then divided into the different modules. We established the 'drug supply expedited system in emergencies' based on the above modules, and we organised emergency drills to verify the system's effectiveness and to improve efficiency. Pharmaceutical care services were performed by rehearsing the unexpected emergency incident and associated pharmaceutical care. Results We developed a drug supply framework for 'traffic accidents, poisoning first aid, natural disasters, epidemics and mass disturbances' and established an 'emergency drug supply expedited system'. We quickly equipped the drugs that were needed for the special emergency events, and we developed a 'green channel' between the emergency and drug supply centres.

In our body there are subcutaneous (sWAT), visceral (vWAT) and bone marrow (bWAT) fat depots. Obesity affects the size, function and inflammatory state of WATs. In particular, obesity may affect the activity of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) present in WAT. MSCs are a heterogeneous population containing stromal cells, progenitor cells, fibroblasts and stem cells that are able to differentiate among adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteocytes and other mesodermal derivatives.In the first study of this kind, we performed a comparison of the effects of obesity on MSCs obtained from sWAT, vWAT and bWAT. Our study showed that obesity affects mainly the biological functions of MSCs obtained from bone marrow and vWAT by decreasing the proliferation rate, reducing the percentage of cells in S phase and triggering senescence. The onset of senescence was confirmed by expression of genes belonging to RB and P53 pathways.Our study revealed that the negative consequences of obesity on body physiology may also be related to impairment in the functions of the stromal compartment present in the several adipose tissues.

An HEV8-positive sample was used to inoculate two cynomolgus macaques to examine the potential for cross-species infection. The pathogenicity of HEV8 was analyzed by testing HEV markers and liver function during the study period and histopathology of liver biopsy specimens at 3, 13, and 25 weeks postinoculation. Extrahepatic replication was tested by using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunofluorescence assays. The overall prevalence of HEV8 RNA in Chinese Bactrian camels was 1.4% (4/295), and positive samples were found in three different provinces/regions in China. Histopathology confirmed acute and chronic HEV8 infections in the two monkeys. Multiple tissues were positive for HEV RNA and ORF2 proteins. Renal pathology was observed in the monkey with chronic hepatitis. Whole-genome sequencing showed only 1 to 3 mutations in the HEV8 in the fecal samples from the two monkeys compared to that from the camel. HEV8 is circulating in multiple regions in China. Infection of two monkeys with HEV8 induced chronic and systemic infections, demonstrating the high potential zoonotic risk of HEV8.IMPORTANCE It is estimated that one-third of the world population have been exposed to hepatitis E virus (HEV). In developed countries and China, zoonotic HEV strains are responsible for almost all acute and chronic HEV infection cases. It is always of immediate interest to investigate the zoonotic potential of novel HEV strains. In 2016, we discovered a novel HEV genotype, HEV8, in Bactrian camels, but the epidemiology, zoonotic potential, and pathogenicity of the virus were unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that HEV8 was circulating in multiple regions in China and was capable of infecting cynomolgus macaques, a surrogate for humans, posing high risk of zoonosis. Chronic hepatitis, systemic infection, and renal pathology were observed. Collectively, these data indicate that HEV8 exhibits a high potential for zoonotic transmission. Considering the importance of Bactrian camels as livestock animals, risk groups, such as camelid meat and milk consumers, should be screened for HEV8 infection.","Wang, Lin; Teng, Jade L L; Lau, Susanna K P; Sridhar, Siddharth; Fu, Hongwei; Gong, Wanyun; Li, Manyu; Xu, Qieshi; He, Yunye; Zhuang, Hui; Woo, Patrick C Y; Wang, Ling",Journal of virology,371,29

The structure of the epigenome consists of covalent modifications of chromatin components, including acetylation by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylation by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Targeting these enzymes with inhibitors to restore epigenetic homeostasis has been explored for many cancers. Osteosarcoma, an aggressive bone malignancy that primarily affects children and young adults, is notable for widespread genetic and epigenetic instability. This may explain why therapy directed at unique molecular pathways has failed to substantially improve outcomes in osteosarcoma over the past four decades. In this review, we discuss the potential of targeting the cancer epigenome, with a focus on histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) for osteosarcoma. We additionally highlight the safety and tolerance of HDACi, combination chemotherapy with HDACi, and the ongoing challenges in the development of these agents.","Collier, Christopher D; Getty, Patrick J; Greenfield, Edward M",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,371,27

The Balliol Collaboration has recommended a set of guidelines (Innovation, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term study [IDEAL]) that permit innovation while minimizing complications. OBJECTIVE To utilize the IDEAL model of surgical innovation in the development of a novel surgical technique, robotic kidney transplantation (RKT) with regional hypothermia, and describe the process of discovery and development. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Phase 0 (simulation) studies included the establishment of techniques for pelvic cooling, graft placement in a robotic prostatectomy model, and simulation of the RKT procedure in a cadaveric model. Phase 1 (innovation) studies began in January 2013 and involved treatment of a highly selective small group of patients (n=7), using the principles utilized in the phase 0 studies, at a tertiary referral center. INTERVENTION IDEAL model implementation in the development of RKT with regional hypothermia. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS For phase 0 studies, the outcomes evaluated included pelvic and body temperature measurements, and technical feasibility assessment. The primary outcome during phase 1 was post-transplant graft function. Other outcomes measured were operative and ischemic times, perioperative complications, and intracorporeal graft surface temperature. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Phase 0 (simulation phase): Pelvic cooling to 15-20(o)C was achieved reproducibly. Using the surgical approach developed for robotic radical prostatectomy, vascular and ureterovesical anastomoses could be done without redocking the robot. Phase 1 (innovation phase): All patients underwent live-donor RKT in the lithotomy position. All grafts functioned immediately. Mean console, anastomotic, and warm ischemia times were 154 min, 29 min, and 2 min, respectively. One patient was re-explored on postoperative day 1. CONCLUSIONS Adherence to the IDEAL guidelines put forth by the Balliol Collaboration provided a practical framework for the establishment of a novel surgical procedure, RKT with regional hypothermia, without exposing the initial patients to unacceptable risk.

The influence of non-clinical factors must also be considered. This review explores the non-clinical factors that may influence general practitioners (GPs) when deciding whether or not to refer a paediatric patient to the Emergency Department (ED). METHODS A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature published from August 1980 to July 2019 was conducted to explore the non-clinical factors that influence GPs' decision-making in referring paediatric patients to the emergency department. The results were synthesised using a narrative approach. RESULTS Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Non-clinical factors relating to patients, GPs and health systems influence GPs decision to refer children to the ED. GPs reported parents/ caregivers influence, including their perception of severity of child's illness, parent's request for onward referral and GPs' appraisal of parents' ability to cope. Socio-economic status, GPs' aversion to risk and system level factors such as access to diagnostics and specialist services also influenced referral decisions. CONCLUSIONS A myriad of non-clinical factors influence GP referrals of children to the ED. Further research on the impact of non-clinical factors on clinical decision-making can help to elucidate patterns and trends of paediatric healthcare and identify areas for intervention to utilise resources efficiently and improve healthcare delivery.","Conlon, Ciara; Nicholson, Emma; Rodríguez-Martin, Beatriz; O'Donovan, Roisin; De Brún, Aoife; McDonnell, Thérѐse; Bury, Gerard; McAuliffe, Eilish",BMC family practice,371,1

STUDY DESIGN Descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University Hospital, Çanakkale, Turkey from March to August, 2020. METHODOLOGY A retrospective evaluation of patients, who underwent percutaneous tracheostomy with an aerosol box, was conducted. Patients aged over 18 years, diagnosed with COVID-19 and requiring percutaneous tracheostomy were included. Exclusion criteria were: age under 18 years and refusal to participate in the study. Patients' age, gender, comorbidities, APACHE II scores at intensive care admission, numbers of intubated days, durations of tracheostomy opening time, and complications were recorded. RESULTS Twenty-four patients underwent the procedure. Tracheostomy was performed successfully in all 24 cases (100%). The mean age of the cases was 67.2 ± 10.1 years. Four patients experienced minor bleeding related to performing the percutaneous tracheostomy using the aerosol box. No healthcare workers were infected with SARS-CoV-2 while performing the tracheostomy procedure. CONCLUSION Use of the aerosol box had adequate efficacy and safety for performance of the percutaneous tracheostomy procedure in intubated patients with COVID-19, who were being followed up in the intensive care unit.

DATA SOURCES We performed a systematic search of the available literature using PubMed, MEDLINE (Ovid), and Web of Science, combining key terms regarding recent infectious disease outbreaks and psychological and coping responses. Papers published from database inception to April 20, 2020, were considered for inclusion. Only studies in the English language and papers from peer-reviewed journals were included. STUDY SELECTION We identified 95 (PubMed) and 49 papers (Web of Science) from the database search, of which 23 papers were eventually included in the review. DATA EXTRACTION The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were used for data extraction. The McMaster University critical appraisal tool was used to appraise quantitative studies. Guidelines by Higginbotham and colleagues were used to appraise qualitative studies. Only studies exploring the combined psychological and coping responses of HCW amid infectious diseases were included. RESULTS Salient psychological responses that can persist beyond the outbreaks included anxiety/fears, stigmatization, depression, posttraumatic stress, anger/frustration, grief, and burnout, but also positive growth and transformation. Personal coping methods (such as problem solving, seeking social support, and positive thinking) alongside workplace measures (including infection control and safety, staff support and recognition, and clear communication) were reported to be helpful. CONCLUSIONS Psychological support for HCW in the current COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks should focus on both individual (eg, psychoeducation on possible psychological responses, self-care) and institutional (eg, clear communication, providing access to resources for help, recognition of efforts of HCW) measures.","Chew, Qian Hui; Wei, Ker Chiah; Vasoo, Shawn; Sim, Kang",The Journal of clinical psychiatry,371,26

With a diagnostic and educational toolkit that is heavily centred on face-to-face clinical examination, dermatology education has been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Online channel-based messaging apps such as Slack offer an opportunity to engage students in remote, multi-modal collaborative learning by reproducing a classroom environment in the virtual space. OBJECTIVE To determine feasibility, acceptability and proof of concept for an online Slack community in undergraduate dermatology education. METHODS Undergraduate medical students participated in an online classroom for a six-week programme encompassing case-based discussions, seminars and journal clubs. The platform was facilitated by junior doctors (n=10) and patient educators (n=6). Students and faculty completed a post-course evaluation. Students additionally completed a pre- and post-intervention dermatology quiz. Mixed methods analyses included quantitative analyses to explore data trends and qualitative phenomenographic analyses to assimilate key underlying themes. RESULTS Students (n=65) were enrolled to join the platform. The evaluation was completed by students (n=52) from UK universities (n=27). The majority of students (n=27) interacted with the platform as passive observers, with a small group of ""super-users"" (n=4). 96% of participants and 100% of faculty described the overall quality of the course as excellent. CONCLUSION A community-based online classroom can act as an enjoyable, acceptable and collaborative means of delivering dermatology education to undergraduate medical students. Its ease of use and supportive nature may also facilitate patient involvement. Such advances may provide vital safeguards against the reduction in face-to-face learning that has accompanied the pandemic.","Phillips, A L; Edwards, S; Parmesar, K; Soltan, M; Guckian, J",Clinical and experimental dermatology,371,1

It plays important roles in the developing tissues of the nerves, heart and mammary glands. Particularly in neurobiology, NRG1 signalling is associated with synaptic transmission, myelination of Schwann cells and the human disease of schizophrenia. Many different isoforms of NRG1 make the molecule highly sophisticated in biological activities and a great diversity of in vivo functions. The nervous system is a common trait in all bilateria (higher animals), but based on the BLAST information from the currently available databases it appears that NRG1 orthologues can only be identified in vertebrates. The gene was analysed in silico for type I-IV CDSs (coding sequences) from ten vertebrate genomes. The gene loci, structures of coding-intronic sequences, ClustalW program analyses, phylogenetic trees and conserved motifs in ecto- and cyto-plasmic domains were analysed and compared. Here, we conclude that non-mammalian vertebrates mainly carry type I (may have evolved a spacer different from mammalian isoforms), II and III NRG1s. The type IV NRG1 N-terminal CDSs can be identified from most of the mammalian genomes studied; however, the corresponding rodent sequences lack the start codon. The evolutionary conservation of a CDS59-CDS24-CDS103 domain, intracellular phosphorylation sites and bipartite nuclear localization signals is of physiological significance.","Chou, Chih-Fong; Ozaki, Miwako",Bioscience reports,371,1

PATIENTS Patients undergoing completed robotic-assisted pancreatic resection and reconstruction at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, between October 3, 2008, and February 26, 2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary pathology, operative time, operative blood loss, perioperative blood transfusions, pancreatic fistula, 90-day morbidity and mortality, and readmission rate. RESULTS Thirty patients with a median age of 70 years (range, 32-85 years) underwent completed robotic-assisted pancreatic resection and reconstruction. Procedures were robotic-assisted non-pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (n = 24), robotic-assisted central pancreatectomy (n = 4), and the robotic-assisted Frey procedure (n = 2). The median operative time was 512 minutes (range, 327-848 minutes). The median blood loss was 320 mL (range, 50-1000 mL), with a median length of hospital stay of 9 days (range, 4-87 days). The final diagnoses included periampullary adenocarcinoma (n = 7), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (n = 6), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (n = 5), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (n = 4), mucinous cystic neoplasm (n = 3), serous cystic adenoma (n = 2), chronic pancreatitis (n = 2), and solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (n = 1). There was 1 postoperative death. The overall pancreatic fistula rate was 27% (n = 8). The clinically significant pancreatic fistula rate (International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula grades B and C) was 10% (n = 3). Clavien grade III and IV complications occurred in 7 patients (23%), while Clavien grade I and II complications occurred in 8 patients (27%).

METHODS The Complete Self-Expanding (SE) Multicenter Trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00814970) enrolled 196 patients (124 men; mean age 68.7±10.5 years) from 28 centers in the United States and Europe. The patients presented with intermittent claudication (193/196) or ischemic rest pain (3/196) and were treated with nitinol stents for obstructive lesions of the SFA or PPA. Over a quarter of lesions (29.9%) were chronic total occlusions. The mean lesion length was 60.7 mm. Moderate to severe calcification was present in 91.0% of lesions. RESULTS A total of 225 stents were successfully implanted in 213 (99.5%) of 214 lesions. Acute lesion success (<30% residual stenosis) was achieved in 90.0%. There were no in-hospital major adverse events. Primary patency (defined as a peak systolic velocity ratio <2.0) at 12 months was 72.6%. Clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) was required in 8.4% of patients at 12 months. The mean ankle-brachial index increased from 0.7 at baseline to 0.9, and there was sustained improvement in the Rutherford category, with 83% of patients classified as Rutherford category 0 or 1 at 12-month follow-up. No stent fractures were detected through 12 months. CONCLUSION In this multicenter trial, primary implantation of a new-generation self-expanding nitinol stent in the SFA and PPA was associated with a low rate of TLR and sustained clinical benefit at 12 months without stent fracture.","Laird, John R; Jain, Ash; Zeller, Thomas; Feldman, Robert; Scheinert, Dierk; Popma, Jeffrey J; Armstrong, Ehrin J; Jaff, Michael R",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,371,1

The data were obtained from the ELSI-COVID-19 initiative, a telephone survey conducted among participants in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), which includes a national sample representative of the population aged 50 years or older. The outcomes evaluated were three protective measures (not having left home in the past week, wearing a mask when leaving home, and sanitizing hands when returning home), and the explanatory variables were health behaviours (smoking, alcohol consumption, consumption of fruits and vegetables, and physical activity). The associations were evaluated by logistic models, considering adjustments for potential confounding factors. A total of 5,827 individuals participated in the analysis; 32.2% did not leave home in the last week, and among those who left home, 97.5% used a face mask, and 97.3% sanitized their hands when they returned home. The practice of physical activity at the recommended levels was associated with a lower chance of not leaving home in the previous week. Ex-smokers were more likely to use a mask, and those who practised physical activity were less likely to adopt this protective measure. Individuals with low-risk alcohol consumption had a higher chance of sanitizing their hands. Actions aimed at increasing the adoption of protective measures to fight the new coronavirus should consider the existence of vulnerable groups, which can be identified by the distribution of other health behaviours in the population.","Peixoto, Sérgio Viana; Nascimento-Souza, Mary Anne; Mambrini, Juliana Vaz de Melo; Andrade, Fabiola Bof de; Malta, Deborah Carvalho; Lima-Costa, Maria Fernanda",Cadernos de saude publica,371,1

The quality control of newly made secretory proteins relies on the ability of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to segregate and compartmentalize molecules at different folding states. These folding states are communicated by N-glycans present on most secretory proteins. In ER-associated degradation (ERAD), protein molecules that have been identified as terminally misfolded are sent for degradation at the cytosolic proteasomes after being dislocated from the ER to the cytosol. This review will focus on how misfolded glycoprotein molecules are segregated from their properly folded counterparts and targeted to ERAD. The pathway involves compartmentalization, which is intimately linked to differential N-glycan processing.

In the previous studies, various types of scaffolds and growth factors were used in impaired wound healing. However, there were several limitations to use them such as short half-life of growth factors in vivo and inadequate experimental conditions of wound-dressing material. Thus, our study aimed to determine the biocompatibility and stability of the matrix containing structurally stabilized epidermal growth factor (S-EGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (S-bFGF). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We stabilized EGF and bFGF that are structurally more stable than existing EGF and bFGF. We developed biocompatible matrix using S-EGF, S-bFGF, and hyaluronate- collagen dressing (HCD) matrix. The developed matrix, S-EGF and S-bFGF loaded on HCD matrix, had no cytotoxicity, in vitro. Also, these matrixes had longer releasing period that result in enhancement of half-life. Finally, when these matrixes were applied on the wound of diabetic mice, there were no inflammatory responses, in vivo. Thus, our results demonstrate that these matrixes are biologically safe and biocompatible as wound-dressing material. CONCLUSIONS Our stabilized EGF and bFGF was more stable than existing EGF and bFGF and the HCD matrix had the capacity to efficiently deliver growth factors. Thus, the S-EGF and S-bFGF loaded on HCD matrix had improved stability. Therefore, these matrixes may be suitable for impaired wound healing, resulting in application of clinical treatment.","Choi, Seong Mi; Ryu, Hyun Aae; Lee, Kyoung-Mi; Kim, Hyun Jung; Park, Ik Kyu; Cho, Wan Jin; Shin, Hang-Cheol; Choi, Woo Jin; Lee, Jin Woo",Biomaterials research,371,1

Result: From a total of 82 COVID-19 patients who entered the study, 32 (39.03%) and 50 (60.97%) subjects were inpatients and outpatients, respectively. Moreover, 32 (39.03%) subjects were male and 50 (60.97%) were female. Insomnia seen in 24 (29.3%) patients and adjustment disorder in 13 (15.9%) patients were the most common psychiatric disorders among a total of 33 (40.2%) patients suffering from mental illness. Female and hospitalized patients presented significantly more frequent comorbidities than males and outpatients. Conclusions: Psychiatric disorders were significantly more common in patients with hospital admission than those without and more frequent in female versus male subjects. There were no significant differences between male and female subjects with and without admission according to the PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PSS-14 scores. It was concluded that telepsychiatry in the early stages of mental problems during a catastrophic event like the coronavirus pandemic, can be an efficient instrument for the screening of psychosomatic comorbidities, so that pharmacological treatment (considering possible drug interactions with COVID-19 medications) and psychotherapeutic intervention can be optimized by psychiatrists.","Zarghami, Arman; Farjam, Mojtaba; Fakhraei, Bahareh; Hashemzadeh, Kosar; Yazdanpanah, Mohammad Hosein",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,371,1

Design A single-center prospective observational study was carried out. Setting ICU of a tertiary care center. Patients Consecutive adults with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. Intervention Renal replacement therapy. Main variables of interest Demographic data, medical history, illness severity, type of oxygen therapy, laboratory data and use of renal replacement therapy to generate a logistic regression model describing independent risk factors for mortality. Results Of the total of 166 patients, 51% were mechanically ventilated and 26% required renal replacement therapy. The overall hospital mortality rate was 36%, versus 56% for those requiring renal replacement therapy, and 68% for those with both mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy. The logistic regression model identified four independent risk factors for mortality: age (adjusted OR 2.8 [95% CI 1.8-4.4] for every 10-year increase), mechanical ventilation (4.2 [1.7-10.6]), need for continuous venovenous hemofiltration (2.3 [1.3-4.0]) and C-reactive protein (1.1 [1.0-1.2] for every 10 mg/L increase). Conclusions In our cohort, acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy was associated to a high mortality rate similar to that associated to the need for mechanical ventilation, while multiorgan failure necessitating both techniques implied an extremely high mortality risk.","Burke, E; Haber, E; Pike, C W; Sonti, R",Medicina intensiva,371,24

Most of these studies were performed in English speaking countries using the original English version of the manual. Our study aimed to examine the feasibility of the translated MCT manual in a sample of German patients with major depressive disorder. METHODS Twenty outpatients (6 male, 14 female, mean age 42.1y) with major depressive disorder were included. The main outcome was drop-out rate and satisfaction with the treatment; secondary outcomes were changes in metacognitive beliefs assessed with the metacognitive questionnaire 30 (MCQ-30), and symptom reduction measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-2 sum score (BDI-2). RESULTS No drop-outs during the treatment and the follow-up phase were observed. Patients and therapists were highly satisfied with MCT treatment. The MCQ-30 significantly declined over the treatment course, paralleled by a significant reduction of the BDI-2 sum scores (from 29 ± 8.6 at T0 to 8.4 ± 9.6 at the end of treatment). The average treatment duration was 10 ± 4 sessions. CONCLUSIONS Applying the German version of the manual for Metacognitive Therapy proved to be feasible in the treatment of depressed patients in an outpatient setting. The treatment was well tolerated by German patients. Outcome in terms of reduction of depressive symptoms was good. Remarkable is the comparably short treatment duration which should be investigated further in future studies.

The medical gaze of the doctor/author further complicates the political and philosophical discourse of mass migration, foregrounding and calling into question the myriad ways in which the migrating human body is subjugated to forms of structural violence that render it ungrievable and inhuman. The migrating body, a production of and outcast from nation-states, is destined to make its way to news outlets where its suffering is gazed upon, sympathised with and later forgotten about. The surge of images revealing the realities of migrating bodies afflicted with pain, disease, trauma and sexual assault is illustrative of the asymmetric power of biopolitics at work, in which some bodies are, according to the formulations of Judith Butler and Giorgio Agamben, allowed to die or made killable. This paper will examine issues of illness, death and dying in relation to Bartolo's accounts of refugees in order to observe what is gained and what is lost in applying a medical gaze to the 'refugee crisis'. In addition to the memoir, we examine the scholarship of violence against the refugee body, the realities of ignoring their pain and how these exploited bodies are portrayed within a global narrative. This article reconfigures the detachment between the human as a socially constructed centre of subjectivity and the body in pain. The corporeality of illness and death that migrants face positions them in an abject position and distances them farther from the rhetoric of human rights. The ontological being of these individuals in medical discourse rarely goes beyond acknowledging that it is normal and expected for these bodies to be in pain. In what ways can we in the humanities gear the discussion towards the raw physicality of fragmentation, distortion and rejection of refugees and immigrants? What role can such a view play in building an ethic of lasting care for the dispossessed? Our research addresses these questions through our reading of the memoir.","Asaad, Lava; Spencer, Matthew",Medical humanities,371,27

Early data have indicated that older patients are at higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than younger ones, but precise international estimates of the age-breakdown of COVID-19-related deaths are lacking. Materials and Methods: We evaluated the distribution of COVID-19-related fatalities by age groups in Europe. On April 6, 2020, we systematically reviewed COVID-19-related mortality data from 32 European countries (European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom). We collated official reports provided by local Public Health or Ministry of Health websites. We included countries if they provided data regarding more than 10 COVID-19-related deaths stratified by age according to pre-specified groups (i.e., < 40, 40-69, [â¥] 70 years). We used random-effects meta-analysis to estimate the proportion of age groups among all COVID-19-related fatalities. Results: Thirteen European countries were included in the review, for a total of 31,864 COVID-19-related deaths (range: 27-14,381 per country). In the main meta-analysis (including data from Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland; 21,522 COVID-19-related fatalities), the summary proportions of persons < 40, 40-69, and [â¥] 70 years of age among all COVID-19-related deaths were 0.1% (0.0-0.2%; I2 24%), 12.8% (10.3-15.6%; I2 94%), and 84.8% (81.3-88.1%; I2 96%), respectively. Conclusions: People under 40 years of age represent a small fraction of the total number of COVID-19-related deaths in Europe.

For cyberthreats, phishing, which can be sent via email, can harm information systems in the organization. However, the risks from this kind of threats can be reduced if the employees have cybersecurity awareness. To prove this hypothesis with Thai employees, this paper presents a comparative study of cybersecurity awareness enhancement associated with the employees who work in different departments within the same organization in Bangkok, Thailand. In this study, the first phishing attack simulation was conducted before providing knowledge and training in cybersecurity to the employees and attacking with the second simulation. After result collection and analysis, it has been found that there are significant differences in cybersecurity awareness level between Thai employees from technology-based departments (e.g., IT department) and social-based departments (e.g., HR department) within the same organization. Of course, the technology-based employees are the better. Furthermore, it has been found that the cybersecurity awareness level of Thai employees from the social-based department, which were poor when compared to the other one, was improved obviously after they were involved with the cybersecurity awareness enhancement processes. © 2021 IEEE.","Daengsi, T.; Wuttidittachotti, P.; Pornpongtechavanich, P.; Utakrit, N.","2nd International Conference on Smart Computing and Electronic Enterprise, ICSCEE 2021",371,0

PrP ligands could theoretically antagonize prion formation by protecting the native protein from misfolding or by targeting it for degradation, but no validated small-molecule binders have been discovered to date. We deployed a variety of screening methods in an effort to discover binders of PrP, including 19F-observed and saturation transfer difference (STD) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), DNA-encoded library selection, and in silico screening. A single benzimidazole compound was confirmed in concentration-response, but affinity was very weak (Kd > 1 mM), and it could not be advanced further. The exceptionally low hit rate observed here suggests that PrP is a difficult target for small-molecule binders. While orthogonal binder discovery methods could yield high affinity compounds, non-small-molecule modalities may offer independent paths forward against prion disease.","Reidenbach, Andrew G; Mesleh, Michael F; Casalena, Dominick; Vallabh, Sonia M; Dahlin, Jayme L; Leed, Alison J; Chan, Alix I; Usanov, Dmitry L; Yehl, Jenna B; Lemke, Christopher T; Campbell, Arthur J; Shah, Rishi N; Shrestha, Om K; Sacher, Joshua R; Rangel, Victor L; Moroco, Jamie A; Sathappa, Murugappan; Nonato, Maria Cristina; Nguyen, Kong T; Wright, S Kirk; Liu, David R; Wagner, Florence F; Kaushik, Virendar K; Auld, Douglas S; Schreiber, Stuart L; Minikel, Eric Vallabh",bioRxiv,371,27

While several studies have characterized the effectiveness of vaccines against severe forms of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection, estimates of their impact on transmissibility remain limited. Here, we evaluated the role of vaccination and isolation on SARS-CoV-2 transmission within Israeli households. Methods From December 2020 to April 2021, confirmed cases were identified among healthcare workers of the Sheba Medical Centre and their family members. Households were recruited and followed up with repeated PCR for a minimum of ten days after case confirmation. Symptoms and vaccination information were collected at the end of follow-up. We developed a data augmentation Bayesian framework to ascertain how age, isolation and BNT162b2 vaccination with more than 7 days after the 2nd dose impacted household transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Findings 210 households with 215 index cases were enrolled. 269 out of 687 (39%) household contacts developed a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those, 170 (63%) developed symptoms. Children below 12 years old were less susceptible than adults/teenagers (Relative Risk RR=0.50, 95% Credible Interval CI 0.32-0.79). Vaccination reduced the risk of infection among adults/teenagers (RR=0.19, 95% CI 0.07-0.40). Isolation reduced the risk of infection of unvaccinated adult/teenager (RR=0.11, 95% CI 0.05-0.19) and child contacts (RR=0.16, 95% CI 0.07-0.31) compared to unvaccinated adults/teenagers that did not isolate. Infectivity was significantly reduced in vaccinated cases (RR=0.22, 95% CI 0.06-0.70). Interpretation Within households, vaccination reduces both the risk of infection and of transmission if infected. When contacts were not vaccinated, isolation also led to important reductions in the risk of transmission. Vaccinated contacts might reduce their risk of infection if they isolate, although this requires confirmation with additional data.

Under the current pandemic situation available green space is further reduced when some parks are closed or open with limited functions to reduce the spread of coronavirus. At the same time, the demand for green space has increased because of the unavailability of other activities. In this essay, we call the attention of urban planners and designers to pocket parks. Studies have shown that the tiny size of pocket parks makes them an easier fit into vacant properties scattered throughout the urban fabric. Therefore, pocket parks can improve health and encourage social cohesion of residents in often underserved high density urban neighborhoods. The potential of pocket parks in providing accessible urban green space to all urban population may have been considered desirable before the coronavirus outbreak and now it should be considered a necessary ‘lifeline’ to improve urban residents’ health during the coronavirus. In addition, with the long-overlooked value of accessible urban green space waken by the global-scale crisis, proper attention and improvement strategy, such as introducing more pocket park could lead to a better future after the COVID-19.","Liu, Shu Wang Xinhao",Urban Forestry & Urban Greening,371,16

The efficiency (in Fama’s sense) of crude oil markets is revisited in this research through the investigation of the predictive ability of technical trading rules (TTRs). The predictive ability and trading performance of a plethora of TTRs are explored on the crude oil markets, as well as on the energy sector ETF XLE, while taking a special focus on the turbulent COVID-19 pandemic period. We are interested in whether technical trading strategies, by signaling the right timing of market entry and exits, can predict oil market movements. Research findings help to confidently conclude on the weak-form efficiency of the WTI crude oil and the XLE fund markets throughout the 1999–2021 period relative to the universe of TTRs. Moreover, results attest that TTRs do not add value to the Brent market beyond what may be expected by chance over the pre-pandemic 1999–2019 period, confirming the efficiency of the market before 2020. Nonetheless, research findings also suggest some temporal inefficiency of the Brent market during the 1 and ¼ years of pandemic period, with important consequences for energy markets’ practitioners and issuers of policy. Research findings further imply that there is evidence of a more intense financialization of the WTI crude oil market, which requires tighter measures from regulators during distressed markets. The Brent oil market is affected mainly by variations in oil demand and supply at the world level and to a lesser degree by financialization and the activity of market practitioners. As such, we conclude that different policies are needed for the two oil markets and also that policy issuers should employ distinct techniques for oil price forecasting.","Tudor, Cristiana Anghel Andrei",Energies,371,1

Methods: Exploratory analyses involved meta-analysis of bulk and single cell RNA data for IFITM3 and FYN differential expression. For confirmatory analyses, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on an AD gene signature from AD Consensus transcriptomics;using the Enrichr platform, we scrutinized COVID-19 datasets for significant, overlapping enriched biological networks. Results: Bulk RNA data analysis revealed that IFITM3 and FYN were differentially expressed in two CNS regions in AD: the temporal cortex (AD vs. Controls, adj.p-value=1.3e-6) and the parahippocampal cortex (AD vs. controls, adj.p-value=0.012). Correspondingly, single cell RNA analysis of IFITM3 and FYN revealed that it was differentially expressed in neuronal cells donated from AD patients (astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocyte precursor cells), when compared to controls. Conclusion: IFITM3 and by extent FYN were found as interactors within biological networks overlapping between AD and SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2-mediated IFITM3 induction would mechanistically result in increased A production. FYN recruitment by viral processes results in abrogation of both fusion of IFITM3 vesicles with lysosomes;immunoevasion, by FYNmediated impairment of autophagy would then serve to promote impaired detoxification from A, while propagating Tau pathology in an IFITM3-independent manner.","Vavougios, G.; Breza, M.; Nikou, S.; Krogfelt, K.",European Journal of Neurology,371,10

In two experiments, participants listened to tone sequences varying in pitch and spectral peak frequency; these two dimensions changed at systematically different rates. Inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) and EEG signal amplitude at the rates of pitch and spectral change allowed us to measure cortical tracking of these dimensions. In Experiment 1, tone sequences varied in the size of the pitch intervals, while the size of spectral peak intervals remained constant. Neural entrainment to pitch changes was greater for sequences with larger compared to smaller pitch intervals, with no difference in entrainment to the spectral dimension. In Experiment 2, participants selectively attended to either the pitch or spectral dimension. Neural entrainment was stronger in response to the attended compared to unattended dimension for both pitch and spectral dimensions. These findings demonstrate that bottom-up and top-down attentional mechanisms enhance the cortical tracking of different acoustic dimensions within a single sound stream.","Symons, Ashley E.; Dick, Fred; Tierney, Adam T.",bioRxiv,371,1

To balance these competing demands, policymakers need analytical tools to assess the costs and benefits of different mobility reduction measures. In this paper, we present our work motivated by our interactions with the Virginia Department of Health on a decision-support tool that utilizes large-scale data and epidemiological modeling to quantify the impact of changes in mobility on infection rates. Our model captures the spread of COVID-19 by using a fine-grained, dynamic mobility network that encodes the hourly movements of people from neighborhoods to individual places, with over 3 billion hourly edges. By perturbing the mobility network, we can simulate a wide variety of reopening plans and forecast their impact in terms of new infections and the loss in visits per sector. To deploy this model in practice, we built a robust computational infrastructure to support running millions of model realizations, and we worked with policymakers to develop an interactive dashboard that communicates our model's predictions for thousands of potential policies. © 2021 ACM.","Chang, S.; Wilson, M.

The machine’s body plan combines several parts that build upon the target RNA, assembling an immobile, DNA:RNA 4-way junction, which contains a single gene encoding a hammerhead ribozyme (HHR). Full assembly of the machine’s body from its parts enables the subsequent elongation of the gene and transcription of HHR molecules, followed by HHR-mediated digestion of the target molecule. This digestion converts the target to a building block suitable for participation in the assembly of more copies of the machine, mimicking biological heterotrophy. In this work we describe the general design of a prototypical machine, characterize its activity cycle and kinetics, and show that it can be efficiently and safely delivered into live cells. As a proof of principle, we constructed a machine that targets the Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) GP64 gene, and show that it effectively suppresses viral propagation in a cell population, exhibiting predator/prey-like dynamics with the infecting virus. In addition, the machine significantly reduced viral infection, stress signaling, and innate immune activation inside virus-infected animals. This preliminary design could control the behavior of antisense therapies for a range of applications, particularly against dynamic targets such as viruses and cancer.","Shapiro, Anastasia; Rosenberg, Alexander; Levy-Zamir, Adva; Bassali, Liron; Ittah, Shmulik; Abu-Horowitz, Almogit; Bachelet, Ido",bioRxiv,371,19

Methods: We collected COVID-19 and mental health-related tweets from the UK between March 5, 2020 and January 31, 2021 through the Twitter Streaming API. We conducted topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to examine discussions about mental health concerns. Deep learning algorithms including Face++ were used to infer the demographic characteristics (age and gender) of Twitter users who expressed mental health concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: We showed a positive correlation between COVID-19-related mental health concerns on Twitter and the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Geographic analysis showed that populated urban areas have a higher proportion of Twitter users with mental health concerns compared to England as a whole. Topic modeling showed that general concerns, COVID-19 skeptics, and Death toll were the top topics discussed in mental health-related tweets. Demographic analysis showed that middle-aged and older adults might be more likely to suffer from mental health issues or express their mental health concerns on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Estimates are usually derived from Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) systems, but these do not include non-registered deaths, which may be affected by changes in vital registration coverage over time. Methods Our analytical framework and empirical strategy account for registered mortality and under-registration. This provides a better estimate of the actual mortality impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru. We use population and crude mortality rate projections from Peru's National Institute of Statistics and Information (INEI, in Spanish), individual-level registered COVID-19 deaths from the Ministry of Health (MoH), and individual-level registered deaths by region and age since 2017 from the National Electronic Deaths Register (SINADEF, in Spanish). We develop a novel framework combining different estimates and using quasi-Poisson models to estimate total excess mortality across regions and age groups. Also, we use logistic mixed-effects models to estimate the coverage of the new SINADEF system. Findings We estimate that registered mortality underestimates national mortality by 37•1% (95% CI 23% - 48•5%) across 26 regions and nine age groups. We estimate total all-cause excess mortality during the period of analysis at 173,099 (95% CI 153,669 - 187,488) of which 108,943 (95% CI 96,507 - 118,261) were captured by the vital registration system. Deaths at age 60 and over accounted for 74•1% (95% CI 73•9% - 74•7%) of total excess deaths, and there were fewer deaths than expected in younger age groups. Lima region, on the Pacific coast and including the national capital, accounts for the highest share of excess deaths, 87,781 (95% CI 82,294 - 92,504), while in the opposite side regions of Apurimac and Huancavelica account for less than 300 excess deaths. Interpretation Estimating excess mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as Peru must take under-registration of mortality into account. Combining demographic trends with data from administrative registries reduces uncertainty and measurement errors. In countries like Peru, this is likely to produce significantly higher estimates of excess mortality than studies that do not take these effects into account. Funding None. Resumen Contexto El exceso de mortalidad por toda causa es una medida combinada de los efectos directos e indirectos del COVID-19 en la mortalidad. Las estimaciones generalmente se derivan de los sistemas de Registro Civil y Estadísticas Vitales, pero estos no incluyen las muertes no registradas;y por ello, la estimación de la mortalidad puede verse afectada por los cambios en la cobertura del registro vital a lo largo del tiempo. Métodos Nuestro marco analítico y estrategia empírica tienen en cuenta tanto la mortalidad registrada así como el subregistro de mortalidad. Esto proporciona una mejor estimación del impacto real de la mortalidad de la primera ola de la pandemia de COVID-19 en Perú. Utilizamos proyecciones de población y tasa bruta de mortalidad del Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Información (INEI) de Perú, muertes por COVID-19 registradas a nivel individual del Ministerio de Salud y muertes registradas a nivel individual por región y edad desde 2017 del Registro Nacional Electrónico de Defunciones (SINADEF). Desarrollamos un nuevo marco conceptual que combina diferentes estimaciones y utiliza modelos cuasi-Poisson para estimar el exceso total de mortalidad entre regiones y grupos de edad. Además, utilizamos modelos logísticos de efectos mixtos para estimar la cobertura del nuevo sistema SINADEF. Resultados Estimamos que la mortalidad registrada subestima la mortalidad nacional en un 37•1% (IC del 95%: 23% a 48•5%) en 26 regiones y nueve grupos de edad. Estimamos el exceso de mortalidad total por todas las causas durante el período de análisis en 173,099 (IC del 95%: 153,669 a 187,488) de los cuales 108,943 (IC del 95%: 96,507 a 118,261) fueron capturados por el sistema de registro vital. Las defunciones a los 60 años o más representaron el 74•1% (IC del 95%: 73•9% a 74•7%) del total de muertes en exceso, y hubo menos muertes de las esperadas en los grupos de edad más jóvenes. La región de Lima, en la costa del Pacífico e incluyendo la capital nacional, representa la mayor proporción de muertes en exceso, 87,781 (IC del 95%: 82,294 a 92,504), mientras que en las regiones del lado opuesto de Apurímac y Huancavelica representan menos de 300 muertes en exceso. Interpretación La estimación del exceso de mortalidad en países de ingresos bajos y medianos (PMI) como el Perú debe tener en cuenta el sub-registro de la mortalidad. La combinación de las tendencias demográficas con los datos de los registros administrativos reduce la incertidumbre y los errores de medición. En países como Perú, es probable que esto produzca estimaciones significativamente más altas del exceso de mortalidad que aquellos estudios que no toman en cuenta estos efectos.

Regrettably, the global population and consumption demands are increasing ceaselessly, leading to the need for more resources for food production, which could potentially aggravate the sustainability and ecosystem degradation issues, while stimulating drastic climate change. Meanwhile, the unexpected emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and some implemented measures to combat its spread disrupted agricultural activities and the food supply chain, which also led to a reduction in ecosystem carbonization. This study sets out to explore policy framework and selected feasible actions that are being adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could potentially reduce the emissions even after the pandemic to promote a resilient and sustainable agri-food system. In this study, we reviewed 27 articles that focus on the current state of the agri-food system in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the decarbonization of the agroecosystem. This review has taken the form of a systematic methodology in analyzing the adoption and implementation of various measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 on the impact of the agri-food system and reduction in ecosystem degradation. Up to 0.3 Mt of CO 2 reduction from the agri-food system alone was reportedly achieved during the first 6 months of the pandemic in 23 European countries. The various adopted measures indicate that the circular economy approach is a panacea to achieve the needed sustainability in the agri-food system. Also, it dictates a need for a paradigm change towards improvement on localized food production that promotes sustainable production and consumption. • The recent emergence of the agro-food system nexus as impacted by COVID-19 is reviewed. • Feasible adoption of COVID-19 measures for agroecosystem decarbonization is explored. • The gaps and constraints in the adoption of the CE approach to the agro-food systems were uncovered. • Circular economy in agroecosystems a panacea to sustainable agri-food system.

In this paper, a lumped capacity model was developed to analyze the energy attenuation and partitioning in DED for Inconel (IN) 718 fabrication. Energy absorption and reflection by powders and substrate, energy loss due to radiation and convection as well as latent heat of fusion were quantified based on experimental analysis. High-resolution infrared camera was used to measure the temperature of the molten pool. The energy attenuation by the powders was measured by a power meter. The results suggest that the energy attenuation coefficient of IN 718 in DED is 6.13 % when laser power is 250 W. Also, it is concluded that about 36.3 % of the laser energy is absorbed by the substrate, only a small amount of energy (less than 1 %) is lost due to radiation and convection.","Liu, Zhichao; Wang, Xinlin; Wuest, Thorsten; Zhang, Hong-chao",Procedia Manufacturing,371,17

Here, we report the development of a triboelectroceutical fabric (TECF) consisting of commonly available materials, namely, nylon and silicone rubber (SR), for the fabrication of protective gloves on the nitrile platform as model wearable PPE. A small triboelectric device (2 cm × 2 cm) consisting of SR and nylon on nitrile can generate more than 20 V transient or 41 μW output power, which is capable of charging a capacitor up to 65 V in only ∼50 s. The importance of the present work relies on the TECF-led antimicrobial activity through the generation of an electric current in saline water. The fabrication of TECF-based functional prototype gloves can generate hypochlorite ions through the formation of electrolyzed water upon rubbing them with saline water. Further, computational modelling has been employed to reveal the optimum structure and mechanistic pathway of antimicrobial hypochlorite generation. Detailed antimicrobial assays have been performed to establish effectiveness of such TECF-based gloves to reduce the risk from life-threatening pathogen spreading.

While taxonomic classification can be applied to the viruses identified in such studies, this gives no information as to the type of interaction the virus has with the host. As follow-up studies are performed to address these questions, the description of these virus-host interactions would be greatly enriched by applying a standard set of definitions that typify them. This paper describes a framework with which all members of the human virome can be classified based on principles of ecology. The scaffold not only enables categorization of the human virome, but can also inform research aimed at identifying novel virus-host interactions.","Parker, Michael T.",Yale J Biol Med,371,28

RECENT FINDINGS The pathological significance of DPP-4, either dependent or independent on catalytic activities, on renal diseases has been reported in preclinical studies. With regard to this, we have shown that damaged endothelial cells are converted to a mesenchymal cell phenotype, which is associated with the induction of DPP-4 in endothelial cells. The endothelial mesenchymal transition may contribute to kidney fibrosis; indeed, the antifibrotic effects of DPP-4 inhibitors have been reported elsewhere. However, even though such potential benefits of DPP-4 inhibitors on renal diseases were shown in preclinical studies, clinical trials have not yet revealed significant benefits in renal hard outcomes of DPP-4 inhibitors. SUMMARY To completely understand the beneficial effects of DPP-4 inhibitors, both the following studies are required: first, preclinical studies that analyze deeper molecular mechanisms of DPP-4 inhibition, and, second, clinical studies that investigate whether such potential beneficial effects of DPP-4 inhibitors are relevant to the patients in the clinic.","Takagaki, Yuta; Koya, Daisuke; Kanasaki, Keizo",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,371,1

Unfortunately, there have been few efforts to standardize methods for infectivity assays thus casting a veil of uncertainty over the significance and comparability of results. In order to address this issue, two laboratories proficient in measuring oocyst infectivity conducted independent dose titration studies with neonatal CD-1 mice using standardized protocols and a well-characterized isolate of Cryptosporidium parvum. The resulting independent logistic dose-response models derived by regression analysis were compared with each other and with a published model. The comparisons showed these dose-response functions to be reproducible under standardized conditions. It is important to standardize mouse strain, age of mice at inoculation and necropsy, oocyst isolate, and age of oocysts. However, other factors, including methods used to detect infectivity and to count oocyst doses, appear less critical. Adopting a standardized assay for oocyst infectivity will provide both a basis for comparing data from various oocyst disinfection studies and a suitable platform for evaluating new or existing in vitro viability surrogates such as excystation, vital dyes or cell culture.","Korich, D G; Marshall, M M; Smith, H V; O'Grady, J; Bukhari, Z; Fricker, C R; Rosen, J P; Clancy, J L",The Journal of eukaryotic microbiology,371,1

METHODS An online demographically representative survey was conducted in the United Kingdom (n = 601) and Poland (n = 602) to test the strength of association of trust in authorities, anxiety, threat, and coping appraisals with the intention to comply with advice to shelter in place following a hypothetical chemical spill. The impact of ease of compliance and style of message presentation were also examined. RESULTS Participants were more likely to comply if at home when the incident happened, but message presentation had little impact. Coping appraisals and trust were key predictors of compliance, but threat appraisals were associated with noncompliance. Anxiety was seen to promote behavioral change. UK participants were more likely to comply than Polish participants. CONCLUSIONS Successful crisis communications during an emergency should aim to influence perceptions regarding the efficacy of recommended behaviors, the difficulties people may have in following advice, and perceptions about the cost of following recommended behaviors. Generic principles of crisis communication may need adaptation for national contexts.","Pearce, Julia M; Rubin, G James; Amlôt, Richard; Wessely, Simon; Rogers, M Brooke",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,371,11

This study investigates synthesizing silver bio-nanoparticles (AgNPs) from nematode-symbiotic bacterial toxin complexes as an alternative larvicidal bioinsecticide agent against Culex pipiens larvae. Five species/strains of nematode-symbiotic bacteria, Xenorhabdus indica, Xenorhabdus spp., Photorhabdus luminescens laumondii HP88, Photorhabdus luminescens akhurstii HRM1 and Photorhabdus luminescens akhurstii HS1 were used. AgNPs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction analysis. Larvae were initially exposed to descending concentrations (300, 150, 75, 37.5 and 18.75 µg/ml) of each of the five bacterial toxins (as positive controls) or to the bio-AgNPs synthesized from the same bacterial toxins (200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.12 and 1.5 µg/ml) for 48 hours. Results of toxicity bioassays showed that mortality of treated larvae was concentration-dependent, toxins from X. indica, P. luminescens laumondii HP88 and P. luminescens akhurstii HS1 showed LC50 of 29, 28 and 2002 µg/ml, respectively. While, toxins from P. luminescens akhurstii HRM1 and Xenorhabdus sp. showed LC50 of 199, 318 µg/ml, respectively. Bio-AgNPs synthesized from, X. indica or Xenorhabdus sp. toxins have significantly increased their larvicidal activities (LC50 of 1.6, 3.7 µg/ml ) at 48h post-treatment. Moreover, bio-AgNPs synthesized from P. luminescens laumondii HP88, P. luminescens akhurstii HRM1 or P. luminescens akhurstii HS1 toxins significantly increased their larvicidal activities (LC50 of 2.1, 1.5, 13.9 µg/ml, respectively) at 48h post treatment. In conclusion, the highest larval toxicity was observed when larvae were treated with bio-AgNPs synthesized from P. luminescens akhurstii HRM1 and X. indica, followed by P. luminescens laumondii HP88 and Xenorhabdus sp. Subsequently, data of the present study suggest these bio-AgNPs toxin complexes as potentially effective bio-control candidates in the battle against mosquito.

The specific aims were to quantify pacer inhibition resulting from the monopolar instrument by altering the generator power setting, the generator mode, the distance between the active electrode and the pacemaker, and the location of the dispersive electrode. METHODS A transvenous ventricular lead pacemaker overdrive paced the native heart rate of an anesthetized pig. The primary outcome variable was pacer inhibition quantified as the number of beats dropped by the pacemaker during 5 s of monopolar active electrode activation. RESULTS Lowering the generator power setting from 60 to 30 W decreased the number of dropped paced events (2.3 ± 1.2 vs 1.6 ± 0.8 beats; p = 0.045). At 30 W of power, use of the cut mode decreased the number of dropped paced beats compared with the coagulation mode (0.6 ± 0.5 vs 1.6 ± 0.8; p = 0.015). At 30 W coagulation, firing the active electrode at different distances from the pacemaker generator (3.75, 7.5, 15, and 30 cm) did not change the number of dropped paced beats (p = 0.314, analysis of variance [ANOVA]). The dispersive electrode was placed in four locations (right/left gluteus, right/left shoulder). More paced beats were dropped when the current vector traveled through the pacemaker/leads than when it did not (1.5 ± 1.0 vs 0.2 ± 0.4; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Clinical parameters that reduce the inhibition of a pacemaker by monopolar instruments include lowering the generator power setting, using cut (vs coagulation) mode, and locating the dispersive electrode so the current vector does not traverse the pacemaker generator or leads.","Govekar, Henry R; Robinson, Thomas N; Varosy, Paul D; Girard, Guillaume; Montero, Paul N; Dunn, Christina L; Jones, Edward L; Stiegmann, Greg V",Surgical endoscopy,371,19

Frail older adults are at increased risk of falls, disability, hospitalizations, and death. Frailty may initially be overlooked or incorrectly identified as part of the normal aging process because of the variable nature of the presentation and diagnosis. Symptoms include generalized weakness, exhaustion, slow gait, poor balance, decreased physical activity, cognitive impairment, and weight loss. There is no current recommendation for routine screening. A comprehensive geriatric assessment can identify risk factors and symptoms that suggest frailty. Several validated frailty assessment tools can evaluate a patient for frailty. Patients are diagnosed as not-frail, prefrail, or frail. Patients with a larger number of frail attributes are at higher risk of poor outcomes. The management of frail patients must be individualized and tailored to each patient's goals of care and life expectancy. Physical activity and balance exercises may be suitable for patients who are less frail. Palliative care and symptom control may be appropriate for those who are more frail.","Allison, Robert; Assadzandi, Shauna; Adelman, Megan",American family physician,371,26

The term ""seasonal influenza"" refers to the typical increase in the number of influenza patients in the winter season in temperature zones. However, it is not clear how environmental factors within a single flu season affect influenza infection in a human population. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of temperature and humidity in the 2006-7 flu season on the onset of seasonal influenza using a case-crossover study. We targeted patients who attended one pediatric clinic in Okayama city, Japan and who were diagnosed as being infected with the seasonal influenza virus. Using 2 references (time-stratified and symmetric bidirectional design), we estimated the effects of average temperature and relative humidity from the onset day (lag0) to 10 days before (lag10). The total number of subjects was 419, and their onset days ranged from 26 December 2006 to 30 April 2007. While the onset was significantly associated with lower temperature, relative humidity was not related. In particular, temperatures before the 3-day incubation period had higher-magnitude odds ratios. For example, the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for average temperature at time lag 8 was 1.12 (1.08-1.17) per 1.0℃ decrease. Low environmental temperature significantly increased the risk of seasonal influenza onset within the 2006-7 winter season.","Tsuchihashi, Yuuki; Yorifuji, Takashi; Takao, Soshi; Suzuki, Etsuji; Mori, Shigeru; Doi, Hiroyuki; Tsuda, Toshihide",Acta medica Okayama,371,11

The disease was characterized clinically by erythema and cracking and bleeding of the perianal skin associated with the excretion of poorly formed fecal pellets, liquid, and gas. Light microscopy-observable changes consisted of small intestinal villous atrophy, villous epithelial necrosis, and villous epithelial syncytial cell formation. The cytoplasm of the epithelial syncytial cells contained large numbers of 80-nm viral particles that were often associated with reticular aggregates of electron-dense material. Viral infection principally involved the luminal one-fourth to one-third of the intestinal villi as determined by indirect immunofluorescence. This rotavirus-like agent contained 11 double-stranded RNA segments; however, the migration pattern of these segments in polyacrylamide gels differed from the electrophoretic pattern which is characteristic of the typical rotaviruses. The agent had a buoyant density in CsCl of 1.36 to 1.4 g/cm3 and was labile at pH 3 and at 56 degrees C; however, infectivity of viral inocula was not altered by extensive treatment with ether or by pH 5 buffers.

In contrast, observations in semiarid Chile suggest that a native generalist rodent, the degu (Octodon degus), may be facilitating the expansion of exotic annual plants. We tested this hypothesis with a 20-year data set from a World Biosphere Reserve in mediterranean Chile. In this semiarid environment, rainfall varies annually and dramatically influences cover by both native and exotic annual plants; degu population density affects the composition and cover of exotic and native annual plants. In low-rainfall years, cover of both native and exotic herbs is extremely low. Higher levels of precipitation result in proportional increases in cover of all annual plants (exotic and native species), leading in turn to increases in degu population densities, at which point they impact native herbs in proportion to their greater cover, indirectly favoring the expansion of exotic plants. We propose that bottom-up control of consumers at our site results in top-down indirect facilitation of invasive annual herbs, and that this pattern may be general to other semiarid ecosystems.","Madrigal, Jaime; Kelt, Douglas A; Meserve, Peter L; Gutierrez, Julio R; Squeo, Francisco A",Ecology,371,16

The Department of Haematology established a new set of consensus guidelines in 2002 for antibiotic use in febrile neutropenia. The aim of our study was to audit adherence to the guidelines established for febrile neutropenia in patients treated for haematologic malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS An antibiotic escalation pathway was developed by haematologists and infectious disease physicians. Adherence to the guidelines was audited. Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) who had febrile neutropenia after chemotherapy were reviewed. The audit was performed by a retrospective review of casenotes. RESULTS Forty patients with 100 episodes of febrile neutropenia were surveyed. Thirty-two had AML, 7 had ALL and 1 had undifferentiated leukaemia. In 76% of episodes, fever developed within the first 14 days of neutropenia. In 31 episodes, cefepime was started as the first-line agent; hence, compliance with the first-line agent was 31%. Fever defervesced in 13 episodes. The most common reason for switching antibiotics was persistent fever. There were clinical indications for non-compliance with the use of the first-line agent in all cases. There were 3 deaths - none related to non-compliance with or strict adherence to the guidelines. Four patients had proven fungal infections. CONCLUSIONS Given the complex nature of the cases, compliance was reasonable, as there were valid reasons in all cases where the guidelines were not adhered to. Based on our findings, the guidelines could be simplified.","Wong, Gee Chuan; Tan, Ban Hock","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",371,1

This is of special importance in a country such as South Africa (SA), where scarce resources interface with high levels of need. A large proportion of the SA population has risk factors associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Many people are also potentially medically and socially vulnerable secondary to the high levels of infection with HIV and tuberculosis (TB) in the country. This is the second of two articles. The first examined the clinical evidence regarding the inclusion of HIV and TB as comorbidities relevant to intensive care unit (ICU) admission triage criteria. Given the fact that patients with HIV or TB may potentially be excluded from admission to an ICU on the basis of an assumption of lack of clinical suitability for critical care, in this article we explore the ethicolegal implications of limiting ICU access of persons living with HIV or TB. We argue that all allocation and rationing decisions must be in terms of SA law, which prohibits unfair discrimination. In addition, ethical decision-making demands accurate and evidence-based strategies for the fair distribution of limited resources. Rationing decisions and processes should be fair and based on visible and consistent criteria that can be subjected to objective scrutiny, with the ultimate aim of ensuring accountability, equity and fairness.","Rossouw, T M; Nienaber, A G; Boswell, M T; Moodley, K",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,371,26

The S1 gene of IBV-ZJ971 strain was inserted into plasmid pBI121 under the control of 35 S promoter. Agrobacterium fumefaciens EHA105 with the recombinant vector pBI121 was obtained by tri-parental mating method. So, an efficient potato transformation system mediated by Agrobacterium fumefaciens was established. The rates of calli and shoots differentiation were 100%, and more than 95% respectively, for transgenic potato with S1 gene of IBV. PCR and Southern blot analyses showed that IBV S1 gene was integrated into genomic DNA of the potato plant and most transgenic plants had two copies of S1 gene of IBV. In our experiments, 47 transgenic plantlets have been obtained. Northern blot and ELISA analyses indicated that most transgenic plants could normally transcribe and translate S1 gene of IBV, though the levels of transcription and translation were different in various transgenic plants. Immunity assay with BALB/C mice showed that expression products of transgenic potato with S1 gene of IBV were immunogenic, and ELISA antibody titer reached 1:20 to 1:40 and 1:80 to 1:160 with doses of 0.5 g and 1 g, respectively.

Our experience should alert other clinicians in recognizing this atypical indolent presentation of SARS, to protect health care workers and the community at large and to ensure that these patients are properly treated.","Lam, Man-Fai; Ooi, Gaik C; Lam, Bing; Ho, James C; Seto, Wing H; Ho, Pak L; Wong, Poon C; Liang, Raymond; Lam, Wah K; Tsang, Kenneth W",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,371,16

It is known that among the various types of anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-Id), those designated beta (beta) or internal image can molecularly mimic the antigen and induce biological activities such as anti-viral protection and neutralization. We have recently shown that polyclonal non-internal image anti-idiotypic antibodies of the gamma-type could induce protective anti-coronavirus immunity. In the present study, a polyclonal anti-Id (Ab2) was induced against a neutralizing murine monoclonal antibody (MAb1), designated 5B170.11. Mice immunized with this affinity-purified rabbit Ab2 alpha, a non-internal image antibody, were partially protected against lethal infection by the JHM strain of MHV. However, other polyclonal and monoclonal non-internal image Ab2 induced against another neutralizing Mab1, designated 4-11G.6, were not able to protect mice against lethal infection with the A59 strain of MHV. These results demonstrate that anti-viral protection by altering the idiotypic network with non-internal image-bearing anti-idiotype reagents can be achieved even with some anti-Id of the alpha-type.","Yu, M; Talbot, P J",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,371,16

Our clinical survey showed that cystic oviducts were prevalent at rates of 10% and 15.1% in breeder and commercial hen flocks, respectively. Chlamydial antigens were detected in 20 of 50 pharyngeal swabs (40%) and in 17 of 20 oviduct tissues (85%) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antigen detection kits. The isolated pathogen was identified as Chlamydophila psittaci via complement fixation test, PCE-ELISA, and immunofluorescence assay. Avian influenza virus, Newcastle disease virus, and infectious bronchitis virus were excluded after oviduct tissues were inoculated onto the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonating eggs. The nucleotide sequence of the omp1 gene (accession no. EF202608) from the isolate was similar to that of C. psittaci avian type C (accession no. L25436). Typical cystic oviducts were observed in specific-pathogen-free hens inoculated intraperitoneally with the isolate. The high presence of chlamydial antigen is consistent with the cystic oviducts and poor egg production. We conclude that the isolated C psittaci is most likely associated with cystic oviducts in laying hens.","Zhang, Faming; Li, Shaowen; Yang, Jianming; Pang, Wanyong; Yang, Li; He, Cheng",Avian diseases,371,16

Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection is characterized by dysregulated lung mucosae, and that mucosal homeostasis is heavily influenced by interleukin (IL)-13 activity, we explore recent findings indicating that IL-13 production is proportional to disease severity. We propose that excessive IL-13 contributes to the progression of severe/fatal COVID-19 by (1) promoting the recruitment of immune cells that express inflammatory cytokines, causing a cytokine storm that results in widespread destruction of lung tissue, (2) directly facilitating tissue-remodeling that causes airway hyperinflammation and obstruction, and (3) diverting the immune system away from developing high-quality cytotoxic T cells that confer effective anti-viral immunity. These factors may cumulatively result in significant lung distress, multi-organ failure, and death. Here, we suggest repurposing existing IL-13-inhibiting interventions, including antibody therapies routinely used for allergic lung hyperinflammation, as well as viral vector-based approaches, to alleviate disease. Since many of these strategies have previously been shown to be both safe and effective, this could prove to be a highly cost-effective solution. Relevance for Patients There remains a desperate need to establish medical interventions that reliably improves outcomes for patients suffering from COVID-19. We explore the role of IL-13 in maintaining homeostasis at the lung mucosae and propose that its dysregulation during viral infection may propagate the hallmarks of severe disease - further exploration may provide a platform for invaluable therapeutics.","Deimel, Lachlan Paul; Li, Zheyi; Ranasinghe, Charani",Journal of clinical and translational research,371,26

Department of the Hospital of Piacenza from August 26th 2019 to August 23rd 2020, splitting this period on February 23rd 2020. RESULTS: Our analysis shows a reduction of -18.0% in E.R. accesses. We calculated a growth of deaths in the E.R. equal to +220%. Our orthopaedic pathway recorded a drop of -26.8%. Traumas occurred at home increased (+19.1%). We note an actual drop only on proximal femur fractures (weighted average of -17.7%), while all the others underwent an increase. DISCUSSION: The amount of E.R. accesses registered a drop -18.0%, while the pathway dedicated to emergency cases underwent an increase. The major complexity of clinical conditions influenced the number of hospitalizations and the fear of the infection increased hospitalization refusals. There has been a zeroing of school traumas, a reduction in sport, transfer home-work/work-home, work, roadside, injuries. Total amount of fractures strongly increase after the end of the lockdown. CONCLUSION: our data confirmed the decrease of retirement houses, sports, works and roadsides traumas and a zeroing of schools ones, while those occurred inside domestic environment underwent a consistent raise.

The aim of the present study was to help clinicians gain a better understanding about differences between Influenza virus pneumonia and COVID-19 by comparative analysis of the early-stage clinical features. Methods: Clinical data of patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and influenza A pneumonia identified in our hospital were collected and analyzed retrospectively to identify the clinical features that could differentiate between the two types of viral pneumonia. Results: The two types of viral pneumonia mainly affected adults, especially people over 50 years, with no gender difference between them. Fever, cough, sputum and muscle soreness were the most common symptoms of COVID-19. Some patients with COVID-19 may also exhibit digestive tract symptoms. Elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) was a more common phenomenon in patients with COVID-19 than that in patients with influenza A H1N1 virus pneumonia. In addition, eosinophil count was decreased and the monocyte percentage was increased in COVID-19 patients. The grid-form shadow was a typical presentation of COVID-19 on the lung CT image, and the disease usually progressed quickly within a week. Conclusion: Influenza pneumonia and COVID-19 are two different types of respiratory viral pneumonia with very similar clinical manifestations. The percentage of monocytes is increased and the eosinophil count is decreased in COVID-19. Glass-ground density exudation shadow located peripherally is the typical sign of COVID-19 on the lung CT image, and the shadow often with grid-form sign. These features may not be typically observed in patients with influenza pneumonia. Chest CT scan combined with nucleic acid detection is an effective and accurate method for diagnosing COVID-19.

Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) emerges as a compensatory mechanism used by neurons to adjust their excitability in response to changes in synaptic activity. Recently, glial cells emerged as modulators for neurotransmission by releasing gliotransmitters into the synaptic cleft through pathways that include P2X7 receptors (P2X7R), connexons, and pannexons. However, the role of gliotransmission in the activity-dependent adjustment of presynaptic strength is still an open question. Here, we investigated whether glial cells participate in HSP upon chronic inactivity and the role of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), connexin43 hemichannels (Cx43HCs), and pannexin1 (Panx1) channels in this process. We used immunocytochemistry against vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) to estimate changes in synaptic strength in hippocampal dissociated cultures. Pharmacological manipulations indicate that glial-derived ATP and P2X7R are required for HSP. In addition, inhibition of Cx43 and Panx1 channels reveals a pivotal role for these channels in the compensatory adjustment of synaptic strength, emerging as new pathways for ATP release upon inactivity. The involvement of Panx1 channels was confirmed by using Panx1-deficient animals. Lacking Panx1 in neurons is sufficient to prevent the P2X7R-dependent upregulation of presynaptic strength; however, the P2X7R-dependent compensatory adjustment of synapse density requires both neuronal and glial Panx1. Together, our data supports an essential role for glial ATP signaling and Cx43HCs and Panx1 channels in the homeostatic adjustment of synaptic strength in hippocampal cultures upon chronic inactivity.","Rafael, Alberto; Cairus, Andrea; Tizzoni, Marina; Abudara, Verónica; Vitureira, Nathalia",Mol.

In the current efforts to fight the spread of this virus, authors want to emphasize that atypical clinical presentations of COVID-19 can occur and a high level of suspicion should be maintained. Ocular involvement and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should never be overlooked. In fact, conjunctival mucosae are susceptible to respiratory viruses and remain an important point of entry. For this reason, eye protection in the form of goggles or a face shield should be considered essential for all healthcare providers, even when taking care of patients who are not showing typical symptoms of COVID-19.","Scalinci, Sergio Zaccaria; Trovato Battagliola, Edoardo",IDCases,371,29

According to this theory, learning is optimal when instructional support is decreased going from worked examples via completion problem to autonomous problem solving and learners do not benefit from practicing retrieval with complex content. However, studies on productive failure and retrieval practice have provided clear evidence against these two guidelines. In this article, issues with CLT and research inspired by this theory, which remain largely ignored among cognitive load theorists but have likely contributed to these contradictory findings, are discussed. This article concludes that these issues should make us question the usefulness of CLT in health science education, medical education and other complex domains, and presents recommendations for both educational practice and future research on the matter.","Leppink, Jimmie","Sci. med.

How can lessons learnt during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa help to mitigate the likelihood of a long-term devastating effect of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak on the African continent? Despite COVID-19 spreading quickly across the globe after being first reported in Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019, African countries remained relatively unaffected until the second week of March 2020. The majority of Africa countries have been at low to moderate risk. However, they have experienced many sociocultural, economic, political, and structural challenges. These have included laboratory capacity and logistical challenges; ill-equipped public health systems; land border permeability, and delayed preparedness to transnational threats; and abject economic deprivation, lack of basic infrastructure, and associated sociocultural implications. There needs to be a strong country-level leadership to coordinate and own all aspects of the responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in a collaborative, transparent, and accountable way. Strategic and sustained response plans to fight the pandemic should incorporate culturally competent strategies that harness different cultural practices and strengthen cultural security. They should also promote and strengthen the implementation of the International Health Regulations.","Renzaho, Andre M N",Risk anal,371,16

This paper describes our experience in establishing a Youth Research Advisory Group (YRAG) in South West Sydney (SWS), including barriers and successful strategies. One hundred and fifteen students between school Years 7 and 12 (ages 11-18) took part in at least one of five sessions between 2019 and 2021. In total, we carried out 26 YRAG sessions, with between five and 30 students in each. Sessions focused on mapping the health priorities of the participants and co-developing research project proposals related to their health priorities. Our work with students revealed that their main areas of concern were mental health and stress. This led to material changes in our research strategy, to include ""Mental Health"" as a new research stream and co-develop new mental health-related projects with the students. Important strategies that enabled our research included maintaining flexibility to work seamlessly with organisational and individual preferences, and ensuring our processes were directed by the schools and-most importantly-the students themselves. Strategies such as maintaining an informal context, responding rapidly to student preference, and regularly renegotiating access enabled us to engage with the students to deepen our understanding of their experiences.","Samir, Nora; Diaz, Antonio Mendoza; Hodgins, Michael; Matic, Simone; Bawden, Samira; Khoury, Jessica; Eapen, Valsamma; Lingam, Raghu",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),371,26

CIPNM diagnosis is usually limited to clinical evaluation. We compared patients with ARDS from COVID-19 and other aetiologies, in whom a neurophysiological evaluation for the detection of CIPNM was performed. The aim was to determine if there were any differences between these two groups in frequency of CINPM and outcome at discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-centre retrospective study performed on mechanically ventilated patients consecutively admitted (January 2016-June 2020) to the ICU of Careggi Hospital, Florence, Italy, with ARDS of different aetiologies. Neurophysiological evaluation was performed on patients with stable ventilation parameters, but marked widespread hyposthenia (Medical Research Council score <48). Creatine phosphokinase (CPK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and mean morning glycaemic values were collected. RESULTS: From a total of 148 patients, 23 with COVID-19 infection and 21 with ARDS due to other aetiologies, underwent electroneurography/electromyography (ENG/EMG) recording. Incidence of CIPNM was similar in the two groups, 65% (15 of 23) in COVID-19 patients and 71% (15 of 21) in patients affected by ARDS of other aetiologies. At ICU discharge, subjects with CIPNM more frequently required ventilatory support, regardless the aetiology of ARDS. CONCLUSION: ENG/EMG represents a useful tool in the identification of the neuromuscular causes underlying ventilator wean failure and patient stratification. A high incidence of CIPNM, with a similar percentage, has been observed in ARDS patients of all aetiologies.","Scarpino, Maenia; Bonizzoli, Manuela; Lazzeri, Chiara; Lanzo, Giovanni; Lolli, Francesco; Ciapetti, Marco; Hakiki, Bahia; Grippo, Antonello; Peris, Adriano; Ammannati, Andrea; Baldanzi, Fabrizio; Bastianelli, Maria; Bighellini, Annamaria; Boccardi, Cristina; Carrai, Riccardo; Cassardo, Annalisa; Cossu, Cesarina; Gabbanini, Simonetta; Ielapi, Carmela; Martinelli, Cristiana; Masi, Giulia; Mei, Cristina; Troiano, Simone",Acta neurol. scand,371,1

The most frequently reported coagulation/fibrinolytic abnormality in COVID-19 is the increase in D-dimer, and its relationship with prognosis has been discussed. However, limits exist to the utility of evaluation by D-dimer alone. In addition, since the coagulation/fibrinolytic condition sometimes fluctuates within a short period of time, regular examinations in recognition of the significance of the examination are desirable. The pathophysiology of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) associated with COVID-19 is very different from that of septic DIC, and both thrombotic and hemorrhagic pathologies should be noted. COVID-19 thrombosis includes macro- and microthrombosis, with diagnosis of the latter depending on markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Treatment of COVID-19 is classified into antiviral treatment, cytokine storm treatment, and thrombosis treatment. Rather than providing uniform treatment, the treatment method most suitable for the severity and stage should be selected.

BACKGROUND: There is limited information on cardiovascular involvement in young individuals with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. METHODS: Screening echocardiograms were performed in 54 consecutive student athletes (mean age 19 years; 85% male) who had positive results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction nasal swab testing of the upper respiratory tract or immunoglobulin G antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2. Sequential cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 48 (89%) subjects. RESULTS: A total of 16 (30%) athletes were asymptomatic, whereas 36 (66%) and 2 (4%) athletes reported mild and moderate COVID-19 related symptoms, respectively. For the 48 athletes completing both imaging studies, abnormal findings were identified in 27 (56.3%) individuals. This included 19 (39.5%) athletes with pericardial late enhancements with associated pericardial effusion. Of the individuals with pericardial enhancements, 6 (12.5%) had reduced global longitudinal strain and/or an increased native T1. One patient showed myocardial enhancement, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction or reduced global longitudinal strain with or without increased native T1 values was also identified in an additional 7 (14.6%) individuals. Native T2 findings were normal in all subjects, and no specific imaging features of myocardial inflammation were identified. Hierarchical clustering of left ventricular regional strain identified 3 unique myopericardial phenotypes that showed significant association with the cardiac magnetic resonance findings (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: More than 1 in 3 previously healthy college athletes recovering from COVID-19 infection showed imaging features of a resolving pericardial inflammation. Although subtle changes in myocardial structure and function were identified, no athlete showed specific imaging features to suggest an ongoing myocarditis.

During April 2020, ExoFlo was provided to 24 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction-positive patients at a single hospital center, all of whom met criteria for severe COVID-19 as well as moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients received a single 15 mL intravenous dose of ExoFlo and were evaluated for both safety and efficacy from days 1 to 14 post-treatment. All safety endpoints were met with no adverse events observed within 72 h of ExoFlo administration. A survival rate of 83% was observed. In total, 17 of 24 (71%) patients recovered, 3 of 24 (13%) patients remained critically ill though stable, and 4 of 24 (16%) patients expired for reasons unrelated to the treatment. Overall, after one treatment, patients' clinical status and oxygenation improved with an average pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2) increase of 192% (P < 0.001). Laboratory values revealed significant improvements in absolute neutrophil count [mean reduction 32% (P value <0.001)] and lymphopenia with average CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ lymphocyte counts increasing by 46% (P < 0.05), 45% (P < 0.05), and 46% (P < 0.001), respectively. Likewise, acute phase reactants declined, with mean C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer reduction of 77% (P < 0.001), 43% (P < 0.001), and 42% (P < 0.05), respectively. In conclusion, owing to its safety profile, capacity to restore oxygenation, downregulate cytokine storm, and reconstitute immunity, ExoFlo is a promising therapeutic candidate for severe COVID-19.

La enfermedad de Parkinson es uno de los trastornos neurodegenerativos que más rápido aumento ha mostrado en las últimas décadas, por lo que es importante establecer algunas recomendaciones para el manejo de estos pacientes. Aunque hasta el momento no hay evidencia contundente que demuestre que la enfermedad de Parkinson aumenta el riesgo de desenlaces adversos del covid-19, es posible que la presencia de diversas comorbilidades y la edad avanzada puedan aumentar las complicaciones y la probabilidad de estancia prolongada en caso de contraer la infección. El uso de herramientas de evaluación a distancia como la telemedicina garantizan una valoración oportuna y permiten la realización de ajustes al tratamiento en el momento en que éstos sean requeridos, mejorando la calidad de vida de los pacientes durante este periodo. Adicionalmente, en esta revisión se generan recomendaciones asociadas al manejo de terapias avanzadas como la cirugía de estimulación cerebral profunda y los dispositivos de infusión de medicamentos, y se exponen consideraciones relacionadas con las terapias de rehabilitación, actividad física y bienestar psicológico de estos pacientes en el transcurso de la pandemia.","Moreno López, Claudia Lucía; Bernal-Pacheco, Óscar; Barrios Vincos, Gustavo; Cerquera Cleves, Sonia Catalina",Acta neurol. colomb,371,16

However, due to the great variability in published results regarding COVID-19-induced chemosensory impairments and their follow-up, prognosis for chemosensory functions in patients with such complaints remains unclear. ObjectiveTo describe the various chemosensory alterations associated with COVID-19 and their prevalence and evolution at 3 to 7 months after infection. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA follow-up study of 704 health care workers with a RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 28/2/2020 and 14/6/2020 was conducted 3 to 7 months after onset of symptoms. Data were collected with an online questionnaire. Participant had to be [≥]18 years old without respiratory illness in the 2 weeks prior to questionnaire completion. Main outcomes and measuresOutcomes included differences in reported chemosensory self-assessment of olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal functions across time points and Chemosensory Perception Test scores from an easy-to-use at-home self-administered chemosensory test. ResultsAmong the 704 health care worker participants, 593 (84.2%) were women, the mean (SD) age was 42 (12) years and the questionnaire was answered on average 4.8 (0.8) months after COVID-19. During COVID-19, a decrease in olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal sensitivities were reported by 81.3%, 81.5% and 48.0% respectively. Three to seven months later, reduced sensitivity was still reported by 52.0%, 41.9% and 23.3% respectively. Chemosensory Perception Test scores indicate that 19.5% of participants had objective olfactory impairment. Conclusions and relevanceA significant proportion of COVID-19 cases have persistent chemosensory impairments at 3 to 7 months after their infection but the majority of those who had completely lost their olfactory, gustatory and trigeminal sensitivity have improved. Given the possible neurological underpinnings of this observation and the important number of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, further longitudinal studies are needed to better characterize this phenotype and to report eventual post-COVID-19 neurological sequelae.","Bussiere, Nicholas; Mei, Jie; Levesque-Boissonneault, Cindy; Blais, Mathieu; Carazo, Sara; Gros-Louis, Francois; Serres, Gaston De; Dupre, Nicolas; Frasnelli, Johannes",,371,16

The roles of congregate living and skilled nursing care needs in this disparity are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of residential setting and level of skilled nursing care on COVID-19 outcomes for people receiving IDD services, compared to those not receiving IDD services. METHODS: Utilizing publicly available California data on COVID-19 outcomes for people receiving IDD services (early May through October 2, 2020), we report outcomes based on seven types of residence, differentiated by number of residents and level of skilled nursing care provided. We compared these results to the larger California published outcomes. RESULTS: Compared to Californians not receiving IDD services, in general, those receiving IDD services had a 60% lower case rate, but 2.8 times higher case-fatality rate. COVID-19 outcomes varied significantly among Californians receiving IDD services by type of residence and skilled nursing care needs: higher rates of diagnosis in settings with larger number of residents, higher case-fatality and mortality rates in settings that provided 24-h skilled nursing care. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis with COVID-19 among Californians receiving IDD services appears to be related to the number of individuals within the residence, while adverse COVID-19 outcomes were associated with level of skilled nursing care. When data is available, future research should examine whether these relationships persist even when controlling for age and pre-existing conditions.","Landes, Scott D; Turk, Margaret A; Wong, Ashlyn W W A",Disabil Health J,371,29

Indeed, as previously defined, this interaction between obesity and COVID-19 represents a 'syndemic' that requires both current and ongoing attention. At a mechanistic level the chronic inflammatory environment of obesity predisposes to life threatening events such as cytokine storm and enhanced coagulopathy. Obesity and its management are affected by diverse factors manifested at societal, educational, racial, and nutritional levels. A multidisciplinary approach is required to manage obese and type 2 diabetic patients, not only during the current COVID-19 crisis, but to decrease the growing burden of cardiometabolic disease and associated cardiovascular complications impacting future viral pandemics. Further, this syndemic has highlighted disparities in healthcare which need to be addressed to achieve equality in health outcomes in patients infected with COVID-19.","Hill, Michael A; Sowers, James R; Mantzoros, Christos S",Metabolism,371,24

This article aims to report and discuss the data of the first 8 weeks of COVID-19 epidemic in the emergency department (ED) of the University Hospital of Parma. METHODS: The ED visits were analyzed as follows: total ED visits, divided in COVID-19/ non-COVID-19 cases, and in trauma-related/non-trauma-related cases; outcome (i.e., discharged, admitted, dead in the ED) of patients, altogether or stratified according to triage class; age classes of the entire ED population. RESULTS: Total ED visits decreased starting from the first days of the outbreak, then exhibiting progressive growth afterwards. COVID suspected cases rapidly increased, whereas non-COVID suspected dropped and remained well below the standard. Trauma-related cases declined, both as ED visits and as hospital admissions. The percentage and absolute number of patients admitted to hospital wards progressively increased, rapidly overwhelming the number of cases that could be discharged. The admission rate in the lowest priority classes also displayed a marked increase. The youngest age classes dramatically declined, whilst the oldest progressively increased, remaining considerably over the standard rate of the local ED. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has obliged the health care systems to undergo a paradigm shift. Even triage criteria have partially lost their meaning, as shown by the dramatic increase of hospital admissions, even in the lowest priority classes. A deep re-organizational process of the ED was undertaken. Hospitals must be constantly resilient and prepared to these new emergencies in terms of equipment, medical and nurses staff, larger bed capacity in short time, availability of intensive and sub-intensive beds, and flexibility.","Comelli, Ivan; Scioscioli, Francesco; Cervellin, Gianfranco",Acta Biomed,371,16

To date (23.10.2020), there are more than 40 million confirmed cases of the disease in the world, at the same time there is still no effective treatment for the disease. For management and treatment of SARS-Cov2, the development of an antiviral drug is needed. Since the representatives of all human cultures have used medicinal plants to treat viral diseases throughout their history, plants can be considered as sources of new antiviral drug compounds against emerging viruses. The huge metabolic potential of plants allows us to expect discovery of plant compounds for the prevention and treatment of coronavirus infection. This idea is supported by number of papers on the anti-SARS-Cov2 activity of plant extracts and specific compounds in the experiments in silico, in vitro, and in vivo. Here, we summarize information on methods and approaches aimed to search for anti-SARS-Cov2 compounds including cheminformatics, bioinformatics, genetic engineering of viral targets, interacting with drugs, biochemical approaches etc. Our mini-review may be useful for better planning future experiments (including rapid methods for screening compounds for antiviral activity, the initial assessment of the antiviral potential of various plant species in relation to certain pathogens, etc.) and giving a hand to those who are making first steps in this field.","Matveeva, Tatiana; Khafizova, Galina; Sokornova, Sofia",Front Plant Sci,371,1

Results: There were 70 patients in the FHP group and 75 patients in the non-FHP group. The trapezius PPT of the FHP group [2.82(0.86) kg] was significantly higher than that of the non-FHP group [2.46(0.80) kg] (P<0.01). No significant differences in PPT and NDI were observed between the two groups (P>0.05). Low correlation was found between trapezius PPT and FHP negatively (r=-0.273, P<0.01) and no correlation was found between C5-C6 PPT and FHP (r=-0.124, P>0.05).

To investigate the expression level of these SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry genes in the lung airway, we used public gene expression datasets. We have found a differential expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in nasal and bronchial airways relative to age and diseases status. Children were found to have significantly lower expression of COVID-19 receptors in the upper and lower airways (nasal and bronchial). Moreover, the lung airway expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was found to be significantly upregulated in smokers compared with non-smokers, and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with healthy subjects. No difference was observed in the blood expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 between children and adults, or in COPD or diabetic patients. However, a significant increase in blood expression levels of these genes was observed in patients with essential hypertension, whereas only ACE2 was upregulated in the blood of asthmatics. These results suggest that the observed difference in COVID-19 severity between children and adults could, in part, be attributed to the difference in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 airways tissue expression levels. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins to enter human cells. Using gene expression datasets, Halwani and coworkers showed that the airways expression of these receptors is lower in children, but upregulated in smokers and COPD patients. This may contribute to the difference in disease severity observed among these patient categories.","Saheb Sharif-Askari, Narjes; Saheb Sharif-Askari, Fatemeh; Alabed, Mashael; Temsah, Mohamed-Hani; Al Heialy, Saba; Hamid, Qutayba; Halwani, Rabih",Mol.

Timely contact tracing is particularly crucial to limit onwards transmission in settings without established community transmission. METHODS: We conducted an in-depth analysis of the response to a big flight-associated COVID-19 outbreak in Vietnam in March 2020 that involved contact tracing, systematic testing and strict quarantine up to third generation contacts. RESULTS: 183 primary contacts from the flight as well as 1,000 secondary and 311 third generation contacts were traced, tested, and quarantined across 15 provinces across Vietnam. The protracted confirmation of the index case at 3 days and 19 hours after arrival resulted in isolation/quarantine delays of 6.8 days (IQR 6.3-6.8) and 5.8 days (IQR 5.8-7.0) for primary and secondary cases, respectively, which generated 84.0 and 26.4 person-days of community exposure from primary and secondary cases, respectively. Nevertheless, only 5 secondary cases occurred. CONCLUSIONS: A large flight-related COVID-19 cluster was successfully contained through timely, systematic and comprehensive public health responses despite delayed index case identification. Multiagency collaboration and pre-established mechanisms are crucial for low and middle income countries like Vietnam to limit community transmission after COVID-19 importation through air travel.","Quach, Ha-Linh; Hoang Thi, Ngoc-Anh; Khanh, Nguyen Cong; Thai, Pham Quang; Dinh, Phung Cong; Duong, Tran Nhu; Quynh Mai, Le Thi; Nghia, Ngu Duy; Tu, Tran Anh; Quang, La Ngoc; Quang, Tran Dai; Tai, Nguyen Trong; Vogt, Florian; Anh, Dang Duc",Travel Med Infect Dis,371,26

Both intravenous and inhaled magnesium sulphate have a clinical impact on acute severe asthma by inhibition of airway smooth muscle contraction. Besides, magnesium sulphate can dilate constricted pulmonary arteries and reduce pulmonary artery resistance. However, it may affect systemic arteries when administered intravenously. A large number of patients with covid-19 admitted to the hospital suffer from pulmonary involvement. COVID-19 can cause hypoxia due to the involvement of the respiratory airways and parenchyma along with circulatory impairment, which induce ventilation-perfusion mismatch. This condition may result in hypoxemia and low arterial blood oxygen pressure and saturation presented with some degree of dyspnoea and shortness of breath. Inhaled magnesium sulphate as a smooth muscle relaxant (natural calcium antagonist) can cause both bronchodilator and consequently vasodilator effects (via a direct effect on alveolar arterioles in well-ventilated areas) in the respiratory tract. We aim to investigate if inhaled magnesium sulphate as adjuvant therapy to standard treatment can reduce ventilation-perfusion mismatch in the respiratory tract and subsequently improve arterial oxygen saturation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN: A multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel arms design (1:1 ratio) PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18-80 years hospitalized at Masih Daneshvari Hospital and Shahid Dr. Labbafinejad hospital in Tehran and Shahid Sadoughi Hospital in Yazd will be included if they meet the inclusion criteria of the study. Inclusion criteria are defined as 1. Confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal secretions or clinical manifestations along with chest computed tomography (chest CT) scan 2. Presenting with moderate or severe COVID-19 lung involvement confirmed with chest CT scan and arterial oxygen saturation below 93% 3. Length of hospital stay &#8804;48 hours. Patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases including congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmia, heart block, the myocardial injury will be excluded from the study. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants will be randomly divided into two arms. Patients in the intervention arm will be given both standard treatment for COVID-19 (according to the national guideline) and magnesium sulphate (5 cc of a 20% injectable vial or 2 cc of a 50% injectable vial will be diluted by 50 cc distilled water and nebulized via a mask) every eight hours for five days. Patients in the control (comparator) arm will only receive standard treatment for COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES: Improvement of respiratory function and symptoms including arterial blood oxygen saturation, dyspnoea (according to NYHA functional classification), and cough within the first five days of randomization. RANDOMISATION: Block randomisation will be used to allocate eligible patients to the study arms (in a 1:1 ratio). Computer software will be applied to randomly select the blocks. BLINDING (MASKING): The study is an open-label RCT without blinding. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The trial will be performed on 100 patients who will be randomly divided into two arms of control (50) and intervention (50).

Antibody kinetics during the acute phase are well studied, whereas the long-term kinetics are yet to be determined, with contradictory results from the studies to date. Here, we present a longitudinal analysis of the serological responses to a SARS-CoV-2 infection following convalescence and the association with post-COVID syndrome (PCS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 237 serum samples were prospectively collected from 61 participants who had had a SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was confirmed using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). For each participant, anti-nucleocapsid (N) and anti-spike subunit 1 receptor binding domain (RBD/S1) immunoglobulin (Ig) levels were regularly determined over a period of 8 months. COVID-19-associated symptoms were assessed using a standardized questionnaire at study entry and again after 6 months. RESULTS: Antibodies were detectable in 56 of the 61 participants. No substantial decline in anti-SARS-CoV-2 pan-Ig levels was observed for the duration of the follow-up period. Antibody levels correlated positively with the disease severity, body mass index, fever, and smoking status. It was found that 46.8% of the participants suffered from PCS, with olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions being the most commonly reported symptoms. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate stable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and thus may indicate a long-lasting immunity. The results are in line with recently published data and provide further insight concerning asymptomatic to mildly-affected patients, the association with clinical features, and the frequency of PCS.","Gerhards, Catharina; Thiaucourt, Margot; Kittel, Maximilian; Becker, Celine; Ast, Volker; Hetjens, Michael; Neumaier, Michael; Haselmann, Verena",Int J Infect Dis,371,2

DESIGN: Regression discontinuity and time-to-event analysis. SETTING: Two large academic hospitals in a unified health system. PATIENTS OR SUBJECTS: Adult decedents who received greater than or equal to 1 day of ICU care during their terminal admission over a 12-month period. INTERVENTIONS: Implementation of a visit restriction policy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified 940 adult decedents without coronavirus disease 2019 during the study period. For these patients, ICU length of stay was 0.8 days longer following policy implementation, although this effect was not statistically significant (95% CI, -2.3 to 3.8; p = 0.63). After excluding patients admitted before the policy but who died after implementation, we observed that ICU length of stay was 2.9 days longer post-policy (95% CI, 0.27-5.6; p = 0.03). A time-to-event analysis revealed that admission after policy implementation was associated with a significantly longer time to first do not resuscitate/do not intubate/comfort care order (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-3.1; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Policies restricting family presence may lead to longer ICU stays and delay decisions to limit treatment prior to death.

The intervention group was ivermectin and the control group was standard of care or placebo. The primary outcome was mortality reported as risk ratio (RR). RESULTS: There were 9 RCTs comprising of 1788 patients included in this meta-analysis. Ivermectin was associated with decreased mortality (RR 0.39 [95% 0.20-0.74], p = 0.004; I2: 58.2%, p = 0.051).

237163,237163,237163,More Exercise linked to less severe Covid-19,16.64788,7.3239927,2021,"BACKGROUND: Several coronavirus vaccine have been fast-tracked to halt the pandemic, the usage of immune adjuvants that can boost immunological memory has come up to the surface. This is particularly of importance in view of the rates of failure of seroconversion and re-infection after COVID-19 infection, which could make the vaccine role and response debatable. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) have an established immune-modulatory role, but their effects as adjuvants to vaccination have not been explored to date. It is increasingly recognized that PPAR agonists can upregulate the levels of anti-apoptotic factors such as MCL-1. Such effect can improve the results of vaccination by enhancing the longevity of long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs). The interaction between PPAR agonists and the immune system does not halt here, as T cell memory is also stimulated through enhanced T regulatory cells, antagonizing PD-L1 and switching the metabolism of T cells to fatty acid oxidation, which has a remarkable effect on the persistence of T memory cells. What is even of a more significant value is the effect of PPAR gamma on ensuring a profound secretion of antibodies upon re-exposure to the offending antigen through upregulating lipoxin B4, therefore potentially assisting the vaccine response and deterring re-infection. SHORT CONCLUSION: In view of the above, we suggest the use of PPAR as adjuvants to vaccines in general especially the emerging COVID-19 vaccine due to their role in enhancing immunologic memory through DNA-dependent mechanisms.","AbdelMassih, Antoine Fakhry; Menshawey, Rahma; Ismail, Jumana H; Husseiny, Reem J; Husseiny, Yousef M; Yacoub, Shenoda; Kamel, Aya; Hozaien, Rafeef; Yacoub, Elaria; Menshawey, Esraa; Abdelmalek, Abanoub; Abouelazaem, Ahmed; Elhatw, Ahmed; Aboelmaaty, Ahmed; Shahib, Alaaelrahman; Mansour, Amany; Kamal, Aya; Mohamed, Basant; Atif, Bemen; Ghabreal, Beshoy; Abdelmalak, Catherine; Ibrahim, David; Elsaify, Ebtesam; Magdy, Farah; Hanna, Farid G; Hafez, Hadeer; Dahir, Hafsa; Merhom, Kerlos; Ahmed, Maram; Bishara, Mariam; Tawfik, Mina; Youssef, Mina; El Sharnouby, Mohamed; Hamouda, Mourad; Ammar, Musheera; Ali, Nada; Daniel, Nada; El-Husseiny, Nadine; Abdelraouf, Noha; Abdelhameed, Nuran K; Ahmed, Radwa; Othman, Radwa; Mohamadein, Rahma; Allam, Rana; Elgendy, Rana; Shebl, Rana; Elsherbiney, Saged; Fouad, Sarah; Emel, Sara; Owais, Sara",J Genet Eng Biotechnol,371,16

Preliminary analysis of available COVID-19 data in the Arctic at the regional (subnational) level suggests that COVID-19 infections and mortality were highly variable, but generally remained below respective national levels. Based on the trends and magnitude of the pandemic through July, we classify Arctic regions into four groups: Iceland, Faroe Islands, Northern Norway, and Northern Finland with elevated early incidence rates, but where strict quarantines and other measures promptly curtailed the pandemic; Northern Sweden and Alaska, where the initial wave of infections persisted amid weak (Sweden) or variable (Alaska) quarantine measures; Northern Russia characterised by the late start and subsequent steep growth of COVID-19 cases and fatalities and multiple outbreaks; and Northern Canada and Greenland with no significant proliferation of the pandemic.

The currently administered vaccines depend on adenovirus DNA vectors or on SARS-CoV-2 mRNA that might become reverse transcribed into DNA, however infrequently. In some societies, people have become sensitized against the potential short- or long-term side effects of foreign DNA being injected into humans. In my laboratory, the fate of foreign DNA in mammalian (human) cells and organisms has been investigated for many years. In this review, a summary of the results obtained will be presented. This synopsis has been put in the evolutionary context of retrotransposon insertions into pre-human genomes millions of years ago. In addition, studies on adenovirus vector-based DNA, on the fate of food-ingested DNA as well as the long-term persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA/DNA will be described. Actual integration of viral DNA molecules and of adenovirus vector DNA will likely be chance events whose frequency and epigenetic consequences cannot with certainty be assessed. The review also addresses problems of remaining adenoviral gene expression in adenoviral-based vectors and their role in side effects of vaccines. Eventually, it will come down to weighing the possible risks of genomic insertions of vaccine-associated foreign DNA and unknown levels of vector-carried adenoviral gene expression versus protection against the dangers of Covid-19. A decision in favor of vaccination against life-threatening disease appears prudent. Informing the public about the complexities of biology will be a reliable guide when having to reach personal decisions about vaccinations.","Doerfler, Walter",Virus Res,371,1

The aim of this study was to assess the possible roles of Jordanian pharmacists in minimizing the stage of community transmission. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey using Google forms targeting Jordanian pharmacists was conducted during March 2020 and distributed electronically by means of social media. Using the survey tool, we measured the pharmacists' knowledge, the educative activities they perform, and their perceptions regarding undertaking traditional and untraditional roles during the COVID-19 outbreak, as specified by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP). Collected data were analyzed using SPSS version-19. RESULTS: Jordanian pharmacists (n = 449) reported performing various educative activities, and in general, they were knowledgeable about various aspects of the COVID-19 disease (median knowledge score: 20 [range, 13-25]), but certain gaps in knowledge were detected that must be addressed. Pharmacists had positive perceptions about both their traditional and untraditional roles specified by the FIP, the median perceptions score was 4 (range, 1-5). CONCLUSIONS: Jordanian pharmacists can be used to reduce community transmission of the outbreak. However, more actions are required to keep pharmacists knowledgeable with recent disease updates to enable them to perform their tasks effectively during times of crisis.","Abdel Jalil, Mariam; Alsous, Mervat M; Abu Hammour, Khawla; Saleh, Mais M; Mousa, Rimal; Hammad, Eman A",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,371,24

METHODS: Systematic review conducted with a comprehensive search including formal databases, COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 data sources, grey literature, and manual search. We considered for inclusion clinical trials, observational longitudinal comparative and non-comparative studies, cross-sectional, before-and-after and case series. We assessed the methodological quality by using specific tools based on the study designs. We presented the results as a narrative synthesis regarding frequency and duration of long COVID, signs and symptoms, criteria used for diagnosis, and potential risk factors. RESULTS: We included 25 observational studies with moderate to high methodological quality, considering 5,440 participants. The frequency of long COVID ranged from 4.7 to 80%, and the most prevalent signs/symptoms were chest pain (up to 89%), fatigue (up to 65%), dyspnea (up to 61%), and cough and sputum production (up to 59%). Temporal criteria used to define long COVID varied from 3 to 24 weeks after acute phase or hospital discharge. Potentially associated risk factors were old age, female sex, severe clinical status, a high number of comorbidities, hospital admission, and oxygen supplementation at the acute phase. However, limitations related to study designs added uncertainty to this finding. None of the studies assessed the duration of signs/symptoms. CONCLUSION: The frequency of long COVID reached up to 80% over the studies included and occurred between 3 to 24 weeks after acute phase or hospital discharge. Chest pain, fatigue, dyspnea and cough were the most reported clinical manifestations attributed to the condition. Based on this systematic review findings, there is an urgent need to understand this emerging, complex and challenging medical condition.

The period of confinement, which was characterized by seizing most business activities and allowing only for e-classes at schools and universities, leading also to a lower physical activity, could have affected eating behaviors of people of all ages. In this study we aimed to investigate the impact of the first lockdown period (March-May 2020) on body weight (BW) and on body mass index (BMI) in both adults and adolescents (>16 years old). A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed®, Scopus®, Web of Science® and EMBASE® databases and 36 observational (35 cross-sectional and one cohort) studies were included. BW and BMI changes after/during the lockdown period were examined. BW was stated as increased in a significant part of the individuals (11.1-72.4%), although a range of 7.2-51.4% of individuals reported weight loss. A significant higher BW was observed with a weighted mean between-group difference (WMD) 1.57 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.14) in the post-lockdown period compared to the before lockdown time and higher BMI, 0.31 WMD (95% CI, 0.17 to 0.45) was identified before the lockdown period. At variance with general trends, one study in older adults (>60 years old) notably reported a significant BW loss, suggesting a higher risk for lockdown-induced weight loss and potentially malnutrition in the elderly population. Overall increments in BW are an alarming effect of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to potential higher incidence of overweight, obesity and related health-risks as well as other noncommunicable diseases. Further studies are needed to assess potential group-specific impacts, with particular regard to weight gain in younger people and risk of weight loss, malnutrition and sarcopenia in older adults.","Bakaloudi, Dimitra Rafailia; Barazzoni, Rocco; Bischoff, Stephan C; Breda, Joao; Wickramasinghe, Kremlin; Chourdakis, Michail",Clin. nutr.

We performed a retrospective observational study to explore the capacity of different complete blood cell count (CBC)-derived inflammation indexes to predict in-hospital mortality in this group. METHODS: The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived NLR (dNLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), mean platelet volume to platelet ratio (MPR), neutrophil to lymphocyte × platelet ratio (NLPR), monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), systemic inflammation index (SII), and the aggregate index of systemic inflammation (AISI) were calculated on hospital admission in 119 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Non-survivors had significantly higher AISI, dNLR, NLPR, NLR, SII, and SIRI values when compared to survivors. Similarly, Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed significantly lower survival in patients with higher AISI, dNLR, MLR, NLPR, NLR, SII, and SIRI. However, after adjusting for confounders, only the SII remained significantly associated with survival (HR = 1.0001; 95% CI, 1.0000-1.0001, p = 0.029) in multivariate Cox regression analysis.

In doing so, the manuscript attends to the ways in which human rights are constituted amidst labor and communicative rights, constituting the backdrop against which the pandemic outbreaks take place and the pandemic response is negotiated. Design/methodology/approach: The study is part of a long-term culture-centered ethnography conducted with low-wage migrant workers in Singapore, seeking to build communicative infrastructures for rights-based advocacy and interventions. Findings: The findings articulate the ways in which the outbreaks in dormitories housing low-wage migrant workers are constituted amidst structural contexts of organizing migrant work in Singapore. These structural contexts of extreme neoliberalism work catalyze capitalist accumulation through the exploitation of low-wage migrant workers. The poor living conditions that constitute the outbreak are situated in relationship to the absence of labor and communicative rights in Singapore. The absence of communicative rights and dignity to livelihood constitutes the context within which the COVID-19 outbreak emerges and the ways in which it is negotiated among low-wage migrant workers in Singapore. Originality/value: This manuscript foregrounds the interplays of labor and communicative rights in the context of the health experiences of low-wage migrant workers amidst the pandemic. Even as COVID-19 has made visible the deeply unequal societies we inhabit, the manuscript suggests the relevance of turning to communicative rights as the basis for addressing these inequalities. It contributes to the extant literature on the culture-centered approach by depicting the ways in which a pandemic as a health crisis exacerbates the challenges to health and well-being among precarious workers. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Dutta, M.

DESIGN: Cross- sectional study. METHODS: A Google Forms survey was distributed to athletes from 15 sports in the final phase (last week of April 2020) of the level 5 lockdown period. Descriptive statistics were used to describe player demographic data. Chi-squared tests investigated significance (p<0.05) between observed and expected values and explored sex differences. Post hoc tests with a Bonferroni adjustment were included where applicable. RESULTS: 67% of the 692 respondents were males. The majority (56%) expected RTS after 1-6 months. Most athletes trained alone (61%; p<0.0001), daily (61%; p<0.0001) at moderate intensity (58%; p<0.0001) and for 30-60min (72%).

This study was undertaken to analyse the effect of meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed on the spread of ongoing COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. Methods: The COVID-19 dashboard for five major cities of Saudi Arabia - Riyadh, Makah, Jeddah, Medina and Dammam was used for data collection. The data on weather were collected from the Weather Underground Company (IBM business GA, USA, 2020). The data were analysed by Spearman's rank correlations using JASP statistical software in two main sections. In the first section the data on COVID-19 from cities were combined to analyse the overall picture of COVID-19 and in the second section, different meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity and wind speed were analyzed. Results: Novel data revealed interesting facts on the spreading of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, the data showed that the number of COVID-19 positive cases increases due to the decrease of temperature or humidity, whereas an average decrease in the wind speed was also found to be associated with an elevation of the number of positive cases. Conclusions: This study determined the impact meteorological factors on the infectivity rate of COVID-19. An inverse association was found between the meteorological parameters with the spreading of COIVD-19. Therefore, this study directs the health authorities to implement specific measures against the spreading of this global pandemic based on weather patterns.","Alkhowailed, Mohammad; Shariq, Ali; Alqossayir, Fuhaid; Alzahrani, Osama A; Rasheed, Zafar; Al Abdulmonem, Waleed",Inform Med Unlocked,371,16

Airborne transmission has been recognized as one of the major transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2. This paper presents a systematic approach for evaluating the effectiveness of multi-scale IAQ control strategies in mitigating the infection risk in different scenarios. The IAQ control strategies across multiple scales from a whole building to rooms, and to cubical and personal microenvironments and breathing zone, are introduced, including elevated outdoor airflow rates, high-efficiency filters, advanced air distribution strategies, standalone air cleaning technologies, personal ventilation and face masks. The effectiveness of these strategies for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection are evaluated for specific indoor spaces, including long-term care facility, school and college, meat plant, retail stores, hospital, office, correctional facility, hotel, restaurant, casino and transportation spaces like airplane, cruise ship, subway, bus and taxi, where airborne transmission are more likely to occur due to high occupancy densities. The baseline cases of these spaces are established according to the existing standards, guidelines or practices.

Hyperactivation of this protein by human coronaviruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 has been found to contribute to aberrant complement activation in patients, leading to aggravated lung injury with potentially fatal consequences. This hyperactivation is triggered in the lungs through a conserved, direct interaction between MASP-2 and coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Blocking this interaction with monoclonal antibodies and interfering directly with the catalytic activity of MASP-2, have been found to alleviate coronavirus-induced lung injury both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, a virtual library of 8736 licensed drugs and clinical agents has been screened in silico according to two parallel strategies. The first strategy aims at identifying direct inhibitors of MASP-2 catalytic activity, while the second strategy focusses on finding protein-protein interaction inhibitors (PPIs) of MASP-2 and coronaviral N proteins. Such agents could represent promising support treatment options to prevent lung injury and reduce mortality rates of infections caused by both present and future-emerging coronaviruses. Forty-six drug repurposing candidates were purchased and, for the ones selected as potential direct inhibitors of MASP-2, a preliminary in vitro assay was conducted to assess their interference with the lectin pathway of complement activation. Some of the tested agents displayed a dose-response inhibitory activity of the lectin pathway, potentially providing the basis for a viable support strategy to prevent the severe complications of coronavirus infections.","Flude, Ben M; Nannetti, Giulio; Mitchell, Paige; Compton, Nina; Richards, Chloe; Heurich, Meike; Brancale, Andrea; Ferla, Salvatore; Bassetto, Marcella",Viruses,371,16

Because of this benefit to the environment, the exploitation of the legume-rhizobia symbiosis can contribute to the development of the lower input, sustainable agriculture, thereby, reducing dependency on synthetic fertilizers. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to understand the different levels of regulation of this symbiosis to enhance its nitrogen-fixation efficiency. A different line of evidence attests to the relevance of early molecular events in the establishment of a successful symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia. In this chapter, we will review the early molecular signaling in the legume-rhizobia symbiosis. We will focus on the early molecular responses that are crucial for the recognition of the rhizobia as a potential symbiont.","Valdés-López, Oswaldo; Reyero-Saavedra, María Del Rocío; Isidra-Arellano, Mariel C; Sánchez-Correa, María Del Socorro",Results Probl Cell Differ,371,20

The most extensively developed method to treat the pathologic forms of these proteins is through the administration of exogenous antibodies, or passive immunotherapy. In this review, we discuss the molecular-level strategies that researchers are using to design an effective therapeutic antibody, given the challenges in treating this disease. These challenges include selectively targeting a protein that has misfolded or is pathological rather than the more abundant, healthy protein, designing strategic constructs for immunizing an animal to raise an antibody that has the appropriate conformational selectivity to achieve this end, and clearing the pathological protein species before prion-like cell-to-cell spread of misfolded protein has irreparably damaged neurons, without invoking damaging inflammatory responses in the brain that naturally arise when the innate immune system is clearing foreign agents. The various solutions to these problems in current clinical trials will be discussed.","Plotkin, Steven S; Cashman, Neil R",Neurobiol Dis,371,29

Despite this large body of research, few studies have attempted to evaluate racial discrimination as a casual factor of worse health among racial minority groups. The current study utilized nationally representative data to estimate the causal effect of racial discrimination on cardiovascular disease (CVD), self-rated physical health (SRH), body mass index (BMI), depression disorder, and substance use disorder. In addition, we examined whether the effect of racial discrimination on health was moderated by socio-demographic characteristics (i.e., age, race/ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status, marital status, geographic location, and health insurance coverage). METHODS: Data were from the combined National Survey of American Life and the National Latino and Asian American Study. We applied a propensity score weighting approach to estimate the differences between individuals who reported ever (N = 4358) or never (N = 1836) experiencing racial discrimination on a list of health outcomes (e.g., CVD, SRH, BMI, depression disorder, and substance use disorder). RESULTS: Participants who reported ever experiencing racial discrimination were about 5 % higher CVD risk, had 0.12 points lower SRH, a 3 % higher probability of a depression disorder, and a 2 % higher probability of a substance use disorder. Moderation effects by race/ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status, geographic region, and health insurance coverage were found. CONCLUSION: Our study represents one of the first attempts to apply a propensity score weighting approach to causally link racial discrimination to worse health for racial minority individuals. This study adds to a larger body of research documenting the negative association between racial discrimination and health.","Chen, Shanting; Mallory, Allen B",Soc Sci Med,371,20

We scraped messages posted on Twitter by users from India expressing their emotion or view on the pandemic during the first 40 days of the lockdown. We identified the users who posted frequently and analyzed their usage pattern and their overall emotion during the study period based on their tweets. It was observed that 222 users tweeted frequently during the study period. Out of them, 13.5% were found to be addicted to Twitter and posted 13.67 tweets daily on an average (SD: 4.89), while 3.2% were found to be highly addicted and posted 40.71 tweets daily on an average (SD: 9.90) during the study period. The overall emotion of 40.1% of the users was happiness throughout the study period. However, it was also observed that users who tweeted more frequently were typically angry, disgusted, or sad about the prevailing situation.

SUMMARY: As interest in genomic testing grows, pharmacists have the opportunity to advance the use of PGx in EHPs, in collaboration with other healthcare professionals. In November 2018, a pharmacist-provided PGx service was established in the EHP at the University of Colorado Hospital. The team members included 3 physicians, a pharmacist trained in PGx, a registered dietitian/exercise physiologist, a nurse, and 2 medical assistants. We conducted 4 preimplementation steps: (1) assessment of the patient population, (2) selection of a PGx test, (3) establishment of a visit structure, and (4) selection of a billing model. The PGx consultations involved two 1-hour visits. The first visit encompassed pretest PGx education, review of the patient's current medications and previous medication intolerances, and DNA sample collection for genotyping. After this visit, the pharmacist developed a therapeutic plan based on the PGx test results, discussed the results and plan with the physician, and created a personalized PGx report. At the second visit, the pharmacist reviewed the PGx test results, personalized the PGx report, and discussed the PGx-guided therapeutic plan with the patient. Overall, the strategy worked well; minor challenges included evaluation of gene-drug pairs with limited PGx evidence, communication of information to non-EHP providers, scheduling issues, and reimbursement. CONCLUSION: The addition of a PGx service within an EHP was feasible and provided pharmacists the opportunity to lead PGx efforts and collaborate with physicians to expand the precision medicine footprint at an academic medical center.","Liko, Ina; Corbin, Lisa; Tobin, Eric; Aquilante, Christina L; Lee, Yee Ming",Am J Health Syst Pharm,371,10

COVID-19 was confirmed by a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. The left eye examination showed visual acuity of 0.5 logMAR, fundoscopy showed foveal pigment mobilization, fluorescein angiography revealed a hypofluorescent fovea surrounded by irregular hyperfluorescent defects, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography showed central foveal thinning with disrupted interdigitation and ellipsoid zones. Given the clinical and imaging findings, the diagnosis of AMN was finalized. AMN usually resolves without specific treatment. CONCLUSIONS This case report shows that patients with COVID-19 can develop retinal involvement.

One potential contribution are differences in the glycosylation of target human cells, particularly as SARS-CoV-2 has the capacity to bind sialic acid which is a common, and highly variable, terminal modification of glycans. The viral spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 and the human cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are both densely glycosylated. We therefore sought to investigate whether the glycosylation state of ACE2 impacts the interaction with SARS-CoV-2 viral spike. We generated a panel of engineered ACE2 glycoforms which were analyzed by mass spectrometry to reveal the site-specific glycan modifications. We then probed the impact of ACE2 glycosylation on S binding and revealed a subtle sensitivity with hypersialylated or oligomannose-type glycans slightly impeding the interaction. In contrast, deglycosylation of ACE2 did not influence SARS-CoV-2 binding. Overall, ACE2 glycosylation does not significantly influence viral spike binding. We suggest that any role of glycosylation in the pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 will lie beyond its immediate impact of receptor glycosylation on virus binding.","Allen, Joel D; Watanabe, Yasunori; Chawla, Himanshi; Newby, Maddy L; Crispin, Max",J Mol Biol,371,21

In 2012, IRD developed and piloted Zindagi Mehfooz (Safe Life; ZM) ElR, an Android-based platform that records and analyses individual-level child data in real-time. In 2017 in collaboration with Expanded Programme for Immunization (EPI) Sindh, ZM was scaled-up across the entire Sindh province and is currently being used by 2521 government vaccinators in 1539 basic health facilities, serving >48 million population. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to demonstrate how big immunization data from the ZM-EIR is being leveraged in Sindh, Pakistan for actionable decision making via three use cases (a) improving performance management of vaccinators to increase geographical coverage, (b) quantifying the impact of provincial accelerated outreach activities, and (c) examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on routine immunization coverage to help devise a tailored approach for future efforts. METHODS: From October 2017 to April 2020, more than 2.9 million children and 0.9 million women have been enrolled, and more than 22 million immunization events have been recorded in the ZM-EIR. We extracted de-identified data from ZM-EIR for January 1, 2019 - April 20, 2020, period. Given the needs of each use case, monthly and daily indicators on vaccinator performance (attendance and compliance), daily immunization visits, and the number of antigens administered were calculated. Geo-coordinate data of antigen administration was extracted and displayed on geographic maps using QGIS. All generated reports were shared at fixed frequency with various stakeholders, such as partners at EPI-Sindh, for utilization in decision making and informing policy. RESULT: Our use-cases demonstrate the use of EIR data for data-driven decision making. From January - December 2019, the monthly monitoring of program indicators helped increase the vaccinator attendance from 44% to 88%, while an 85 % increase in geographical coverage was observed in a polio-endemic super high-risk union council (SHRUC) in Karachi. The analysis of daily average antigens administered during accelerated outreach efforts (AOE) as compared to routine activities showed an increase in average daily Pentavalent-3, Measles-1, and Measles-2 vaccines administered by 103%, 154%, and 180% respectively. These findings helped decide to continue the accelerated effort in high-risk areas (compared to the entire province) rather than discontinuing the activity due to high costs. During COVID-19 lockdown, the daily average number of child immunizations reduced from 16,649 to 4335 per day, a decline of 74% compared to 6 months preceding COVID-19 lockdown. ZM-EIR data is currently helping to shape the planning and implementation of critical strategies to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The big data for vaccines generated through EIRs is a powerful tool to monitor immunization work-force and ensure chronically missed communities are identified and covered through targeted strategies. Geospatial data availability and analysis is changing the way EPI review meetings occur with stakeholders, taking data-driven decisions for better planning and resource allocation. In the fight against COVID-19 pandemic, as governments gradually begin to shift from containing the outbreak to strategizing a plan for sustaining the essential health services, the countries that will emerge most successful are likely the ones who can best use technology and real-time data for targeted efforts.","Siddiqi, Danya Arif; Abdullah, Sara; Dharma, Vijay Kumar; Shah, Mubarak Taighoon; Akhter, Mohammed Adil; Habib, Ali; Khan, Aamir Javed; Chandir, Subhash",Int J Med Inform,371,16

There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19, and many vaccine candidates are currently under clinical trials. This study aimed to understand the perception of social media users regarding a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria. Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional survey among social media users in Nigeria in August 2020 using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire includes sections on the demographic characteristics of the respondents and their perception regarding a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 517 respondents completed and returned the informed consent along with the questionnaire electronically. Data were coded and abstracted into Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and loaded into the STATA 14 software for final analysis. Results: the results showed that more than half of the respondents were male 294 (56.9%). Most of the respondents 385 (74.5%) intend to take the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. Among the 132 respondents that would not take the COVID-19 vaccine, the major reason for non-acceptance was unreliability of the clinical trials 49 (37.1%), followed by the belief that their immune system is sufficient to combat the virus 36 (27.3%). We found a significant association between the age of the respondents and the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (P-value=0.00) as well as geographical location and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance (P-value=0.02). Conclusion: it was observed that most of the respondents were willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Our findings also reiterate the need to reassure the public the benefits an effective and safe COVID-19 vaccine can reap for public health. There is a need for national health authorities in Nigeria to ensure public trust is earned and all communities, including the marginalized populations, are properly engaged to ensure an optimal COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.","Adebisi, Yusuff Adebayo; Alaran, Aishat Jumoke; Bolarinwa, Obasanjo Afolabi; Akande-Sholabi, Wuraola; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo",Pan Afr Med J,371,20

To contain this virus, researchers are working around the clock for a solution in the form of vaccine. Due to the impact of this pandemic, the economy and healthcare have immensely suffered around the globe. Thus, an efficient vaccine design is the need of the hour. Moreover, to have a generalised vaccine for heterogeneous human population, the virus genomes from different countries should be considered. Thus, in this work, we have performed genome-wide analysis of 10,664 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries around the globe in order to identify the potential conserved regions for the development of peptide based synthetic vaccine viz. epitopes with high immunogenic and antigenic scores. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment technique viz. Clustal Omega is used to align the 10,664 SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes. Thereafter, entropy is computed for each genomic coordinate of the aligned genomes. The entropy values are then used to find the conserved regions. These conserved regions are refined based on the criteria that their lengths should be greater than or equal to 60 nt and their corresponding protein sequences are without any stop codons. Furthermore, Nucleotide BLAST is used to verify the specificity of the conserved regions. As a result, we have obtained 17 conserved regions that belong to NSP3, NSP4, NSP6, NSP8, RdRp, Helicase, endoRNAse, 2'-O-RMT, Spike glycoprotein, ORF3a protein, Membrane glycoprotein and Nucleocapsid protein. Finally, these conserved regions are used to identify the T-cell and B-cell epitopes with their corresponding immunogenic and antigenic scores. Based on these scores, the most immunogenic and antigenic epitopes are then selected for each of these 17 conserved regions. Hence, we have obtained 30 MHC-I and 24 MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes with 14 and 13 unique HLA alleles and 21 B-cell epitopes for the 17 conserved regions. Moreover, for validating the relevance of these epitopes, the binding conformation of the MHC-I and MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes are shown with respect to HLA alleles. Also, the physico-chemical properties of the epitopes are reported along with Ramchandran plots and Z-Scores and the population coverage is shown as well. Overall, the analysis shows that the identified epitopes can be considered as potential candidates for vaccine design.","Ghosh, Nimisha; Sharma, Nikhil; Saha, Indrajit",Infect Genet Evol,371,32

In Canada, where this study took place, older adults have been encouraged to self-isolate while the rest of the population has been cautioned against in-person contact with them. Prior to COVID-19, social isolation and loneliness among older adults was considered a serious public health concern. Using a series of semi-structured interviews with 26 community-dwelling older adults (65+) living in rural Manitoba, we explore older adults' experiences of isolation and loneliness in the initial stages of the pandemic between the months of May and July 2020. Participants identified a loss of autonomy, loss of activities and social spaces (e.g., having coffee or eating out, volunteering, and going to church), and lack of meaningful connection at home as factors influencing their sense of isolation and loneliness. Although these loses initially influenced participants' self-reported isolation and loneliness, the majority developed strategies to mitigate isolation and loneliness, such as drawing on past experiences of isolation, engaging in physically distanced visits, connecting remotely, and ""keeping busy."" Our findings call attention to the role of different environments and resources in supporting older adults social and emotional wellbeing, particularly as they adapt to changes in social contact over time.","Herron, Rachel V; Newall, Nancy E G; Lawrence, Breanna C; Ramsey, Doug; Waddell, Candice M; Dauphinais, Jennifer",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),371,16

In 2016 epidemics of Zika virus emerged, and in 2020, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We compared patterns of scientific publications for the two infections to analyse the evolution of the evidence. METHODS: We annotated publications on Zika virus and SARS-CoV-2 that we collected using living evidence databases according to study design. We used descriptive statistics to categorise and compare study designs over time. RESULTS: We found 2286 publications about Zika virus in 2016 and 21,990 about SARS-CoV-2 up to 24 May 2020, of which we analysed a random sample of 5294 (24%). For both infections, there were more epidemiological than laboratory science studies. Amongst epidemiological studies for both infections, case reports, case series and cross-sectional studies emerged first, cohort and case-control studies were published later. Trials were the last to emerge. The number of preprints was much higher for SARS-CoV-2 than for Zika virus. CONCLUSIONS: Similarities in the overall pattern of publications might be generalizable, whereas differences are compatible with differences in the characteristics of a disease. Understanding how evidence accumulates during disease outbreaks helps us understand which types of public health questions we can answer and when.","Ipekci, Aziz Mert; Buitrago-Garcia, Diana; Meili, Kaspar Walter; Krauer, Fabienne; Prajapati, Nirmala; Thapa, Shabnam; Wildisen, Lea; Araujo-Chaveron, Lucia; Baumann, Lukas; Shah, Sanam; Whiteley, Tessa; Solís-García, Gonzalo; Tsotra, Foteini; Zhelyazkov, Ivan; Imeri, Hira; Low, Nicola; Counotte, Michel Jacques",BMC Med Res Methodol,371,21

Based on literature research, the classification of genetic mutations continues to be done manually nowadays. Manual classification of genetic mutations is pathologist-dependent, subjective, and time-consuming. To improve the accuracy of clinical interpretation, scientists have proposed computational-based approaches for automatic analysis of mutations with the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies. Nevertheless, some challenges, such as multiple classifications, the complexity of texts, redundant descriptions, and inconsistent interpretation, have limited the development of algorithms. To overcome these difficulties, we have adapted a deep learning method named Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to classify genetic mutations based on text evidence from an annotated database. During the training, three challenging features such as the extreme length of texts, biased data presentation, and high repeatability were addressed. Finally, the BERT+abstract demonstrates satisfactory results with 0.80 logarithmic loss, 0.6837 recall, and 0.705 F-measure. It is feasible for BERT to classify the genomic mutation text within literature-based datasets. Consequently, BERT is a practical tool for facilitating and significantly speeding up cancer research towards tumor progression, diagnosis, and the design of more precise and effective treatments.","Su, Yuhan; Xiang, Hongxin; Xie, Haotian; Yu, Yong; Dong, Shiyan; Yang, Zhaogang; Zhao, Na",Biomed Res Int,371,16

The main goal of this study was to analyze the differences in self-reported physical activity of people with complete spinal cord injuries between the time prior to the COVID-19 lockdown and the lockdown period itself. METHODS: A sample of 20 participants with complete thoracic spinal cord injuries completed the Physical Activity Scale for Individuals with Physical Disabilities before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. RESULTS: The results showed differences between the pre-lockdown and lockdown measurements in total self-reported PA (z=-3.92; P<0.001; d=1.28), recreational PA (z=-3.92; P<0.001; d=1.18) and occupational PA (z=-2.03; P=0.042; d=0.55). Nevertheless, no differences were found in housework PA between the two time periods. Furthermore, the results showed differences in total minutes (z=-3.92; P<0.001; d=1.75), minutes spent on recreational activities (z=-3.82; P<0.001; d=1.56) and minutes spent on occupational activities (z=-2.032; P=0.042; d=0.55) of moderate/vigorous intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with thoracic spinal cord injuries who were full-time manual wheelchair users displayed lower levels of PA during the pandemic than in the pre-pandemic period. The results suggest that the prohibition and restrictions on carrying out recreational and/or occupational activities are the main reasons for this inactivity. Physical activity promotion strategies should be implemented within this population to lessen the effects of this physical inactivity stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Marco-Ahulló, Adrià; Montesinos-Magraner, Lluïsa; González, Luis-Millán; Morales, José; Bernabéu-García, Jose Antonio; García-Massó, Xavier",J Spinal Cord Med,371,16

In the present outbreak, radiological imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and X-rays are being used to diagnose this disease, particularly in the early stage. However, the assessment of radiographic images includes a subjective evaluation that is time-consuming and requires substantial clinical skills. Nevertheless, the recent evolution in artificial intelligence (AI) has further strengthened the ability of computer-aided diagnosis tools and supported medical professionals in making effective diagnostic decisions. Therefore, in this study, the strength of various AI algorithms was analyzed to diagnose COVID19 infection from large-scale radiographic datasets. Based on this analysis, a light-weighted deep network is proposed, which is the first ensemble design (based on MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and FCNet) in medical domain (particularly for COVID19 diagnosis) that encompasses the reduced number of trainable parameters (a total of 3.16 million parameters) and outperforms the various existing models. Moreover, the addition of a multilevel activation visualization layer in the proposed network further visualizes the lesion patterns as multilevel class activation maps (ML-CAMs) along with the diagnostic result (either COVID19 positive or negative). Such additional output as ML-CAMs provides a visual insight of the computer decision and may assist radiologists in validating it, particularly in uncertain situations Additionally, a novel hierarchical training procedure was adopted to perform the training of the proposed network. It proceeds the network training by the adaptive number of epochs based on the validation dataset rather than using the fixed number of epochs. The quantitative results show the better performance of the proposed training method over the conventional end-to-end training procedure. A large collection of CT-scan and X-ray datasets (based on six publicly available datasets) was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model and other baseline methods. The experimental results of the proposed network exhibit a promising performance in terms of diagnostic decision. An average F1 score (F1) of 94.60% and 95.94% and area under the curve (AUC) of 97.50% and 97.99% are achieved for the CT-scan and X-ray datasets, respectively. Finally, the detailed comparative analysis reveals that the proposed model outperforms the various state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative and computational performance.","Owais, M.; Yoon, H.

Whereas, the pathogenesis underlying these neurological manifestations remains elusive. Although in vitro models and animal models are widely used in studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection, human organ models that can reflect the pathological alterations in a multi-organ context are still lacking. In this study, we propose a new strategy to probe the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on human brains in a linked alveolus-BBB organ chip platform. The new multi-organ platform allows to recapitulate the essential features of human alveolar-capillary barrier and blood-brain barrier in a microfluidic condition by co-culturing the organ-specific cells. The results reveal direct SARS-CoV-2 exposure has no obvious effects on BBB chip alone. While, infusion of endothelial medium from infected alveolus chips can cause BBB dysfunction and neuroinflammation on the linked chip platform, including brain endothelium disruption, glial cell activation and inflammatory cytokines release. These new findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could induce neuropathological alterations, which might not result from direct viral infection through hematogenous route, but rather likely from systemic inflammation following lung infection. This work provides a new strategy to study the virus-host interaction and neuropathology at an organ-organ context, which is not easily obtained by other in vitro models. This will facilitate to understand the neurological pathogenesis in SARS-CoV-2 and accelerate the development of new therapeutics.

But substantial numbers of severe episodes occur in older patients. There is a lack of data about COVID-19 in older adults. The aims of this study were to analyze the clinical characteristics of older adult patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective study of older patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from February 1 st to March 31 st, 2020 was conducted in the Sino-French New City Branch of Tongjing Hospital in Wuhan, China. According to the degree of severity of COVID-19 during hospitalization, 312 older patients were divided into non-severe and severe cases. RESULTS: the mean age of the patients was 69.2 ± 7.3 years, and 47.4 % of patients had exposure history. 77.2 % of patients had a co-morbidity, with hypertension being the most common (57.1 %), followed by diabetes (38.8 %) and cardiovascular disease (29.8 %). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of severe COVID-19 associated with age(OR 1.59, 95 %CI 1.13-2.08), SOFA score(OR 5.89, 95 %CI 3.48-7.96), APACHEâ ¡ score(OR 3.13, 95 %CI 1.85-5.62), platelet countï¼125 × 109/L(OR 2.36, 95 %CI 1.03-4.14), d-dimer (OR 4.37, 95 %CI 2.58-7.16), creatinineï¼133 µmol/L(OR 1.85, 95 %CI 1.12-3.04), interleukin-6(OR 4.32, 95 %CI 2.07-7.13), and lung consolidation(OR 1.94, 95 %CI 1.45-4.27) on admission. The most common complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome (35.6 %), followed by acute cardiac injury (33.0 %) and coagulation disorders (30.8 %). 91.7 % of patients were prescribed antiviral therapy, followed by immune globulin (52.9 %) and systemic glucocorticoids (43.6 %). 21.8 % of patients received invasive ventilation, 1.92 % for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The overall mortality was 6.73 %, and mortality of severe patients was 17.1 %, which was higher than non-severe patients (0.962 %). CONCLUSIONS: Older patients with COVID-19 had much more co-morbidity, complications and mortality. More attention should be paid to older patients with COVID-19.","Li, Tao; Lu, Lei; Zhang, Weishuo; Tao, Yu; Wang, Liuming; Bao, Jing; Liu, Bao; Duan, Jun",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,371,24

Frontline healthcare workers with increased exposure to COVID diagnosis, treatment and care were especially likely to report psychological burden, fear, anxiety and depression. AIM: To elicit how working as a health professional during the pandemic is impacting on the psychological wellbeing of frontline staff. METHOD: United Kingdom population of healthcare workers were approached by advertising the survey via social media, NHS trusts and other organisations. Open-ended survey answers were qualitatively explored using content analysis. RESULTS: Survey collected data from 395 NHS staff was developed into three themes; (1) Despair and uncertainty: feeling overwhelmed trying to protect everyone, (2) Behavioural and psychological impact: affecting wellbeing and functioning and (3) Coping and employer support: getting the right help. CONCLUSION: NHS staff felt enormous burden to adequately complete their professional, personal and civil responsibility to keep everyone safe leading to negative psychological and behavioural consequences and desire for NHS employers to offer better support. As the pandemic progresses, the results of this study may inform NHS employers on how optimum support can be offered to help them cope with negative psychological consequences of the pandemic.","Newman, Kristina L; Jeve, Yadava; Majumder, Pallab",Int J Soc Psychiatry,371,22

This study focused on adaptive and maladaptive aspects of interoceptive sensibility and examined how each aspect of interoceptive sensibility affects depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms under the mild lockdown in Japan, which was not enforceable and a non-punitive lockdown. We used data from 10,672 participants who lived in prefectures where the emergency declaration was first applied in Japan. Interoceptive sensibility was measured by the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA). The findings show that Noticing, a subscale of the MAIA, significantly contributed to the worsening of psychological and somatic symptoms (all ps &lt; 0.001). Conversely, Not-Distracting, Not-Worrying, Self-Regulation, and Trusting significantly contributed to the decrease of these symptoms (all ps &lt; 0.05). The findings suggest that two aspects of interoceptive sensibility affected mental health in different ways during the mild lockdown.

The strategy used by SARS-CoV-2 to evade antiviral immunity needs further investigation. Here, we reported that SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b inhibited types I and III IFN production by targeting multiple molecules of innate antiviral signaling pathways. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b impaired the induction of types I and III IFNs by Sendai virus and poly (I:C). SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b inhibited the activation of types I and III IFNs induced by the components of cytosolic dsRNA-sensing pathways of RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS signaling, including RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TBK1, and IKKÎµ, rather than IRF3-5D, which is the active form of IRF3. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b also suppressed the induction of types I and III IFNs by TRIF and STING, which are the adaptor protein of the endosome RNA-sensing pathway of TLR3-TRIF signaling and the adaptor protein of the cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway of cGAS-STING signaling, respectively. A mechanistic analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b protein interacted with RIG-I, MDA-5, MAVS, TRIF, STING, and TBK1 and impeded the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b facilitated the replication of the vesicular stomatitis virus. Therefore, the results showed that SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b negatively regulates antiviral immunity and thus facilitates viral replication. This study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 impairs antiviral immunity and provides an essential clue to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Han, Lulu; Zhuang, Meng-Wei; Deng, Jian; Zheng, Yi; Zhang, Jing; Nan, Mei-Ling; Zhang, Xue-Jing; Gao, Chengjiang; Wang, Pei-Hui",J. med. virol,371,20

The angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) has been reported as the primary host-cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of COVID-19. In this study, we screened ACE2 ligands from Radix Scutellariae and investigated its suppressive effect on SARS-CoV-2 spiked pseudotyped virus in vitro. HEK293T cells stably expressing ACE2 receptors (ACE2 cells) were used to provide the receptor for the ACE2/cell membrane chromatography (CMC) method used for analysis. The SARS-CoV-2-spiked pseudotyped virus was used to examine the anti-viropexis effect of the screened compounds in ACE2 cells. Molecular docking and the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay were used to determine the binding properties. Oroxylin A exhibited an appreciable suppressive effect against the entrance of the SARS-CoV-2-spiked pseudotyped virus into ACE2 cells, which showed good binding to ACE2 as determined using SPR and CMC. Oroxylin A was shown to be a potential candidate in the treatment for COVID-19 by virtue of its blocking the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 into ACE2 cells by specifically binding to the ACE2 receptor.","Gao, Jiapan; Ding, Yuanyuan; Wang, Yuejin; Liang, Peida; Zhang, Liyang; Liu, Rui",Phytother. res,371,23

We aim to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of major trauma and orthopaedic patients admitted in the early COVID-19 era. Methods: A prospective trauma registry was reviewed at a Level 1 Major Trauma Centre. We divided patients into Group A, 40 days prior to 5 March 2020, and into Group B, 40 days after. Results: A total of 657 consecutive trauma and orthopaedic patients were identified with a mean age of 55 years (8 to 98; standard deviation (SD) 22.52) and 393 (59.8%) were males. In all, 344 (approximately 50%) of admissions were major trauma. Group A had 421 patients, decreasing to 236 patients in Group B (36%). Mechanism of injury (MOI) was commonly a fall in 351 (52.4%) patients, but road traffic accidents (RTAs) increased from 56 (13.3%) in group A to 51 (21.6%) in group B (p = 0.030). ICU admissions decreased from 26 (6.2%) in group A to 5 (2.1%) in group B. Overall, 39 patients tested positive for COVID-19 with mean age of 73 years (28 to 98; SD 17.99) and 22 (56.4%) males. Common symptoms were dyspnoea, dry cough, and pyrexia.

A straightforward approach to speed up drug development at lower costs is drug repurposing. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting the interface of SARS CoV-2 with the host via repurposing of clinically licensed drugs and evaluated their use in combinatory treatments with virus- and host-directed drugs in vitro. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We tested the antiviral potential of the antifungal itraconazole and the antidepressant fluoxetine on the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in the polarized Calu-3 cell culture model and evaluated the added benefit of a combinatory use of these host-directed drugs with the direct acting antiviral remdesivir, an inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase. KEY RESULTS: Drug treatments were well-tolerated and potently impaired viral replication. Importantly, both itraconazole-remdesivir and fluoxetine-remdesivir combinations inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles > 90% and displayed synergistic effects, as determined in commonly used reference models for drug interaction. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Itraconazole-remdesivir and fluoxetine-remdesivir combinations are promising starting points for therapeutic options to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe progression of COVID-19.","Schloer, Sebastian; Brunotte, Linda; Mecate-Zambrano, Angeles; Zheng, Shuyu; Tang, Jing; Ludwig, Stephan; Rescher, Ursula",Br J Pharmacol,371,1

Results: Women told longer stories than men, d = 0.31, 95% CI [0.24, 0.38], an effect that did not vary by geographic region but was moderated by cue type (verbal: d = 0.57, [0.44, 0.71]; pictures: d = 0.29, [0.22, 0.36]), response modality (oral: d = -0.04, [-0.18, 0.09]; handwriting: d = 0.39, [0.31, 0.47]; typing: d = 0.31, [0.21, 0.42]), and age (prepubertal children: d = 0.13, [-0.04, 0.30]; pubescents: d = 0.48, [0.23, 0.74]; premenopausal adults: d = 0.36, [0.29, 0.42]; postmenopausal adults: d = -0.09, [-0.35, 0.16]). Consistent with the age effect, estradiol, a sex-dimorphic hormone during the reproductive life stage, was a specific mediator of the sex difference in narrative-writing fluency. This mediation effect was moderated by prenatal hormone exposure, estimated via digit ratio. Conclusions: When verbal fluency is assessed through narrative writing, a robust female advantage becomes evident. It is associated with the reproductive life stage and variations in current estradiol concentrations, particularly in individuals prenatally exposed to relatively more estradiol than testosterone.

Immunomodulatory treatments have been repurposed to improve mortality outcomes. RESEARCH QUESTION: Do immunomodulatory therapies improve survival in patients with COVID-19 cytokine storm (CCS)? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic health records across the Northwell Health system. COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 1, 2020, and April 24, 2020, were included. CCS was defined by inflammatory markers: ferritin, > 700 ng/mL; C-reactive protein (CRP), > 30 mg/dL; or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), > 300 U/L. Patients were subdivided into six groups: no immunomodulatory treatment (standard of care) and five groups that received either corticosteroids, anti-IL-6 antibody (tocilizumab), or anti-IL-1 therapy (anakinra) alone or in combination with corticosteroids. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. RESULTS: Five thousand seven hundred seventy-six patients met the inclusion criteria. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (44%-59%), diabetes (32%-46%), and cardiovascular disease (5%-14%). Patients most frequently met criteria with high LDH (76.2%) alone or in combination, followed by ferritin (63.2%) and CRP (8.4%). More than 80% of patients showed an elevated D-dimer. Patients treated with corticosteroids and tocilizumab combination showed lower mortality compared with patients receiving standard-of-care (SoC) treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% CI, 0.35-0.55; P < .0001) and with patients treated with corticosteroids alone (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53-0.83; P = .004) or in combination with anakinra (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.50-0.81; P = .003). Corticosteroids when administered alone (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.57-0.76; P < .0001) or in combination with tocilizumab (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.35-0.55; P < .0001) or anakinra (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57-0.81; P < .0001) improved hospital survival compared with SoC treatment. INTERPRETATION: The combination of corticosteroids with tocilizumab showed superior survival outcome when compared with SoC treatment and treatment with corticosteroids alone or in combination with anakinra. Furthermore, corticosteroid use either alone or in combination with tocilizumab or anakinra was associated with reduced hospital mortality for patients with CCS compared with patients receiving SoC treatment.","Narain, Sonali; Stefanov, Dimitre G; Chau, Alice S; Weber, Andrew G; Marder, Galina; Kaplan, Blanka; Malhotra, Prashant; Bloom, Ona; Liu, Audrey; Lesser, Martin L; Hajizadeh, Negin",Chest,371,14

In the current study, we undertook a survey to analyze the frequency and distribution of microsatellites or SSRs in multiple genomes of Coronaviridae members. We successfully identified 919 SSRs with length &#8805;12 bp across 55 reference genomes majority of which (838 SSRs) were found abundant in genic regions. The in-silico analysis further identified the preferential abundance of hexameric SSRs than any other size-based motif class. Our analysis shows that the genome size and GC content of the genome had a weak influence on SSR frequency and density. However, we find a positive correlation of SSRs GC content with genomic GC content. We also report relatively low abundances of all theoretically possible 501 repeat motif classes in all the genomes of Coronaviridae. The majority of SSRs were AT-rich. Overall, we see an underrepresentation of SSRs across the genomes of Coronaviridae. Besides, our integrative study highlights the presence of SSRs in ORF1ab (nsp3, nsp4, nsp5A_3CLpro and nsp5B_3CLpro, nsp6, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, & nsp15 domains), S, ORF3a, ORF7a, N & 3' UTR regions of SARS-CoV-2 and harbours multiple mutations (3'UTR and ORF1ab SSRs serving as major mutational hotspots). This indicates the genic SSRs are under selection pressure against mutations that might alter the reading frame and at the same time responsible for rapid protein evolution. Our preliminary results indicate the significance of the limited repertoire of SSRs in the genomes of Coronaviridae.","Satyam, Rohit; Jha, Niraj Kumar; Kar, Rohan; Jha, Saurabh Kumar; Sharma, Ankur; Kumar, Dhruv; Nand, Parma; Ruokolainen, Janne; Kesari, Kavindra Kumar; Kamal, Mohammad Amjad",Chem Biol Interact,371,14

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possibilities of a portable pocket-sized ultrasound scanner in the evaluation of lung involvement in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We conducted 437 paired readings in 34 LUS evaluations of hospitalized individuals with COVID-19. The LUS scans were performed on the same day with a standard high-end ultrasound scanner (Venue GO, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) and a pocket-sized ultrasound scanner (Butterfly iQ, Butterfly Network Inc., Guilford, CT, USA). Fourteen scans were performed on individuals with severe cases, 11 on individuals with moderate cases and nine on individuals with mild cases.

We encourage ecologists, environmental scientists, and resource managers to contribute their observations to efforts aiming to build comprehensive global understanding based on multiple data streams, including anecdotal observations, systematic assessments and quantitative monitoring. We argue that the collective power of combining diverse data will transcend the limited value of the individual data sets and produce unexpected insights. We can also consider the confinement experiment as a “stress test” to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses in the adequacy of existing networks to detect human impacts on natural systems. Doing so will provide evidence for the value of the conservation strategies that are presently in place, and create future networks, observatories and policies that are more adept in protecting biological diversity across the world.","Bates, Amanda E.; Primack, Richard B.; Moraga, Paula; Duarte, Carlos M.",Biol.

This study aims to identify the suicide-related risk factors and stressors to determine the groups at a greater risk of attempting suicide during the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods: This retrospective study examined 29 cases of attempted suicide during the 3-month COVID-19 lockdown in KSA. The suicide risk factors were evaluated using the modified sex, age, depression, previous attempt, excess alcohol, rational thinking loss, social support lacking, organized plan, no spouse, sickness (SAD PERSONS) scale along with a comprehensive assessment of the recent stressful life events. Results: The lockdown stressors that may have triggered suicidal behaviours were identified as follows: psychological distress, relationship problems, financial difficulties, and extreme fear of the COVID-19 infection. While all age groups carried the risk of attempting suicide during the lockdown, patients with psychiatric disorders and women accounted for 69% and 65.5% of the cohort, respectively. Factors including hopelessness and depression were highly related to suicide attempts. The statement of future intent to repeat the attempt was made by 72.4% and 65.5%, respectively. Almost two-thirds of the attempts made were serious, and many women felt unsafe in their own homes during the lockdown. Conclusion: Patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders and women carry high risk of attempting suicide during the COVID-19 lockdown. This study offers insights on the greater outreach efforts that can be carried out for these patients by calling for the prioritization of mental health care, improvement of domestic violence services, and strengthening of suicide prevention strategies.","Almaghrebi, Asma H",,371,1

However, its curative effects and feasibility have yet to be confirmed by formal evaluation and well-designed clinical trials. To explore the effectiveness of treatment and predict the potential effects of CP with COVID-19, studies of different types of infectious disease treated with CP were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Related studies were obtained from databases and screened according to the inclusion criteria. The data quality was assessed, and the data were extracted and pooled for analysis. RESULTS: 40 studies on CP treatment for infectious diseases were included. Our study found that CP treatment could reduce the risk of mortality, with a low incidence of adverse events, promote the production of antibodies, lead to a decline in viral load, and shorten the disease course. A meta-analysis of 15 controlled studies showed that there was a significantly lower mortality rate in the group treated with CP (pooled OR=0.32; 95% CI=0.19-0.52; p<0.001, I2=54%) compared with the control groups. Studies were mostly of low or very low quality, with a moderate or high risk of bias. The sources of clinical and methodological heterogeneity were identified. The exclusion of heterogeneity indicated that the results were stable. CONCLUSIONS: CP therapy has some curative effect and is well tolerated in treating infectious diseases. It is a potentially effective treatment for COVID-19.","Sun, Mengyao; Xu, Yinghui; He, Hua; Zhang, Li; Wang, Xu; Qiu, Qing; Sun, Chao; Guo, Ye; Qiu, Shi; Ma, Kewei",Int J Infect Dis,371,20

Skilled immigrant women face additional gendered disadvantages, including a disproportionate domestic burden, interrupted careers and gender segmentation in occupations and organizations. This study explores how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic impacted skilled newcomer women's labour market outcomes and work experiences. Design/methodology/approach: The authors draw on 50 in-depth questionnaires with skilled women to elaborate on their work experiences during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: The pandemic pushed skilled immigrant women towards unemployment, lower-skilled or less stable employment. Most study participants had their career trajectory delayed, interrupted or reversed due to layoffs, decreased job opportunities and increased domestic burden. The pandemic's gendered nature and the reliance on work-from-home arrangements and online job search heightened immigrant women's challenges due to limited social support and increased family responsibilities. Originality/value: This paper adds to the conversation of increased integration challenges under pandemic conditions by contextualizing the pre-pandemic literature on immigrant work integration to the pandemic environment.

Prospective data regarding this approach from randomised trials is lacking. In the PET NECK study, 564 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck receiving definitive chemoradiation were randomised to either planned neck dissection or PET CT scan guided surveillance. In this surgical trial, three radiotherapy fractionation schedules delivered over 7, 6 or 4 weeks were permitted with synchronous chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to determine efficacy and quality of life outcomes associated with the use of these schedules. Primary local control and overall survival in addition to quality of life measures at immediately post treatment and 6, 12 and 24 months post-treatment were compared between the three fractionation cohorts. In the 525 patients where fractionation data was available, 181 (34%), 288 (55%) and 56 (11%) patients received 68-70 Gy in 34-35 fractions (#), 60-66 Gy in 30# and 55 Gy in 20# respectively. At a minimum follow up of two years following treatment there was no significant difference between the three fractionation schemes in local control, overall survival or any quality of life measure. Despite the obvious limitations of this study, some data is provided to support the use of hypofractionated accelerated chemoradiation to avoid delays in cancer treatment and reduce hospital visits during the peak of a pandemic. Data from on-going randomised trials examining hypofractionated chemoradiation may be useful for selecting fractionation schedules during future pandemics.","Vreugdenhil, M; Fong, Charles; Sanghera, Paul; Hartley, Andrew; Dunn, Janet; Mehanna, Hisham",Oral Oncol,371,16

This study aimed to estimate COVID-19 incidence and mortality in residential care facilities and to compare them with those recorded in nursing homes. DESIGN: Nationwide observational study conducted by French health authorities. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Since March 1, 2020, all LTCFs in France reported all COVID-19 cases and COVID-19-related deaths among their residents. METHODS: Possible cases were those with COVID-19-related symptoms without laboratory confirmation and confirmed cases those with a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test or serology positive for SARS-CoV-2. We included facilities with at least 1 confirmed case of COVID-19 and estimated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases and mortality due to COVID-19 reported until June 30, 2020, using the maximum bed capacity as a denominator. RESULTS: Of the 2288 residential care facilities, 310 (14%) and, of the 7688 nursing homes, 3110 (40%) reported COVID-19 cases among residents (P < .001). The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was significantly lower in residential care facilities as compared with nursing homes (1.10 vs 9.97 per 100 beds, P < .001). Mortality due to COVID-19 was also lower in residential care facilities compared with nursing homes (0.07 vs 1.29 per 100 beds, P < .001). Case fatality was lower in residential care facilities (6.49% vs 12.93%, P < .001). CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: French residential care facilities experienced a much lower burden from COVID-19 than nursing homes. Our findings may inform the implementation of better infection control practices in these settings.","Belmin, Joël; Georges, Scarlett; Franke, Florian; Daniau, Come; Cochet, Amandine; Durand, Cécile; Noury, Ursula; Gomes do Espirito Santo, Maria Eugênia; Fonteneau, Laure; Pariel, Sylvie; Lafuente-Lafuente, Carmelo; Danis, Kostas",J.

Human studies have shown that both low and high levels of leptin can be associated with worse neurocognitive outcomes, suggesting this relationship may be moderated by another risk factor. OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between plasma leptin levels and both neuropsychological test performance and structural neuroimaging and assessed whether body mass index (BMI) is an effect modifier of these associations. METHODS: Our study sample consisted of 2,223 adults from the Framingham Heart Study Third Generation Cohort (average ageâ=â40 years, 53% women). RESULTS: Among the entire sample, there was no association between leptin and any of the neuropsychological domain measures or any of the MRI brain volume measures, after adjustment for BMI, APOE4, and other clinical factors. However, we did observe that BMI category was an effect modifier for the association between leptin and verbal memory (p for interactionâ=â0.03), where higher levels of leptin were associated with better performance among normal weight participants (BMI 18.5-24.9) kg/m2 (betaâ=â0.12, pâ=â0.02). No association was observed between leptin level and verbal memory test performance among participants who were overweight or obese. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the association between leptin and cognitive function is moderated by BMI category. Prospective examination of individuals transitioning from middle age to older adulthood will help to clarify the contribution of leptin to AD and other neurodegenerative conditions.","Sanborn, Victoria; Preis, Sarah R; Ang, Alvin; Devine, Sherral; Mez, Jesse; DeCarli, Charles; Au, Rhoda; Alosco, Michael L; Gunstad, John",J. alzheimers dis,371,16

It has resulted in a difficult situation for cancer patients owing to the risks of the epidemic situation outbreak as well as cancer. Patients with cancer are more likely than the general population to contract COVID-19 because of the systemic immunosuppressive status caused by malignant diseases or anticancer treatment. Lung cancer has the highest morbidity and mortality in China and the world. Most patients with lung cancer are smokers with poor underlying lung conditions and low immunity, thus it is vital to protect them from epidemic diseases during cancer treatment. It is necessary to provide individualized medical treatment and management of treatment-related adverse events for patients with lung cancer based on patients' conditions and regional epidemic patterns. KEY POINTS: Significant findings of the study During the outbreak of COVID-19, taking patients' conditions and regional epidemic patterns into consideration, providing appropriate individualized treatment strategies for lung cancer patients with different stages is an urgent requirement.

A Preliminary Observational Study in Six Patients, Case Report",16.920668,8.99984,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The current COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the measures taken to control it, have a profound impact on healthcare. This study was set up to gain insights into the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on the core competencies of general practice, as they are experienced by general practitioners (GPs) on the frontline. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: We performed a descriptive study using semistructured interviews with 132 GPs in Flanders, using a topic list based on the WONCA definition of core competencies in general practice. Data were analysed qualitatively using framework analysis. RESULTS: Changes in practice management and in consultation strategies were quickly adopted. There was a major switch towards telephone triage and consults, for covid-related as well as for non-covid related problems. Patient-centred care is still a major objective. Clinical decision-making is largely focused on respiratory assessment and triage, and GPs feel that acute care is compromised, both by their own changed focus and by the fact that patients consult less frequently for non-covid problems. Chronic care is mostly postponed, and this will have consequences that will extend and become visible after the corona crisis. Through the holistic eyes of primary care, the current outbreak-as well as the measures taken to control it-will have a profound impact on psychological and socioeconomic well-being. This impact is already visible in vulnerable people and will continue to become clear in the medium and long terms. GPs think that they are at high risk of getting infected. Dropping out and being unable to contribute their part or becoming virus transmitters are reported to be greater concerns than getting ill themselves. CONCLUSIONS: The current times have a profound impact on the core competences of primary care. Although the vast increase in patients soliciting medical help and the necessary separate covid and non-covid flows have been dealt with, GPs are worried about the continuity of regular care and the consequences of the anticovid measures. These may become a threat for the general health of the population and for the provision of primary healthcare in the near and distant future.","Verhoeven, Veronique; Tsakitzidis, Giannoula; Philips, Hilde; Van Royen, Paul",BMJ Open,371,16

Therefore, there is an urgent need for a simple, sensitive, and high-throughput (HTP) assay to quantify virus-host interactions in order to quickly evaluate the infectious ability of mutant viruses and to develop or validate virus-inhibiting drugs. Here, we developed an ultrasensitive bioluminescent biosensor to evaluate virus-cell interactions by quantifying the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) both in living cells and in vitro. We have successfully used this novel biosensor to analyze SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants and evaluated candidate small molecules (SMs), antibodies, and peptides that may block RBD:ACE2 interaction. This simple, rapid, and HTP biosensor tool will significantly expedite the detection of viral mutants and the anti-COVID-19 drug discovery process.","Yang, Xiaolong; Liu, Lidong; Hao, Yawei; So, Eva; Emami, Sahar Sarmasti; Zhang, Derek; Gong, Yanping; Sheth, Prameet M; Wang, Yutian",Viruses,371,24

In this report, we develop a robust in vitro nonradioactive primer extension assay to evaluate the incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analog by SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) quantitively. Our results show that many nucleotide analogs can be incorporated into RNA by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and that the incorporation of some of them leads to chain termination. The discrimination values of nucleotide analog over those of natural nucleotide were measured to evaluate the incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analog by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. In agreement with the data published in literature, we found that the incorporation efficiency of remdesivir-TP is higher than ATP, and incorporation of remdesivir-TP caused delayed chain termination which can be overcome by higher concentrations of the following nucleotide to be incorporated. Our data also showed that the delay chain termination pattern caused by remdesivir-TP incorporation is different for different template sequence. Multiple incorporations of remdesivir-TP caused chain termination in our assay condition. Incorporation of sofosbuvir-TP is very low suggesting that sofosbuvir may not be very effective in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a comparison, 2'-C-methyl-GTP can be incorporated into RNA efficiently, and the derivative of 2'-C-methyl-GTP may have therapeutic application in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. This report provides a simple screening method that should be useful in evaluating nucleotide-based drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and for studying the mechanism of action of selected nucleotide analog.","Lu, Gaofei; Zhang, Xi; Zheng, Weinan; Sun, Jialei; Hua, Lan; Xu, Lan; Chu, Xin-Jie; Ding, Sheng; Xiong, Wen",,371,1

A virtual clinic was piloted to deliver preoperative health optimisation and shared decision-making for patients undergoing critical elective surgery. No literature existed on virtual preoperative clinics for older people to support the development. OBJECTIVE: this healthcare improvement study describes the setup and delivery of the virtual clinic as its primary aim. Secondary aims included: assessing older people's access to technology and their digital literacy for virtual consultation; to describe barriers and facilitators for consultations, as well as evaluation of patient and clinician satisfaction with the consultations' mode of delivery and outcomes. METHODS: a mixed methods healthcare improvement study was undertaken through plan-do-study-act cycles, semi-structure interviews, and quantitative service benchmarking. RESULTS: the pilot evaluated 67 preoperative consultations (43.3% video, 56.7% telephone, mean age 75) with a mix of surgical pathology (vascular 88.1%, colorectal 10.4%, urological 1.5%). Patient feedback demonstrated improved understanding of conditions (90.6%), and adequate opportunity to express opinions and questions (96.2%). Clinicians preferred video consultations (adequate to deliver services: 89.7% video; 68.4% telephone). The greatest barriers to engagement, none of which were exclusions to participation, included cognitive impairment, sensory impairment, or needing technical assistance setting up video consultations (52.2%). CONCLUSIONS: delivering a virtual preoperative medical optimisation and shared decision clinic for older people is feasible. This study will aid other units in developing their own virtual preoperative clinics.

In an attempt to address these educational gaps, researchers, school districts, and government officials have been working to provide resources for those in communities with low economic opportunities, with low levels of educational attainment, and overall defined as being marginalized. This article asks: How can parents and students be more effectively connected with the resources available to them? Then once they are effectively connected, the question remains: To what degree does this access improve students' and families' lives? It is of critical importance to go beyond offering resources, connecting families directly to the resources and documenting the changes that happen. Therefore, the authors implemented an innovative way to do so by incorporating community health and education workers (CHEWs) who can serve as liaisons between families, resources, and schools, providing health and educational outreach and advocacy. Informed by Maslow's hierarchy of need, they believe that what happens outside of the classroom directly impacts a child in the classroom;thus, helping parents and students to connect to resources more effectively ultimately prepares the child for success in the classroom. The article begins by describing who the community health and education workers (CHEWs) are. It goes on to describe how the authors worked with a low-income minority school district in Southern California with over 53,000 students placing CHEWs at schools in hopes of ultimately impacting education by reducing chronic absenteeism, increasing parental engagement, and increasing use of school district resources.","Malika, Nipher Granillo Cristie Belliard Juan Carlos",Childhood Education,371,26

Yet, the pandemic policy development for rural contexts remains poorly defined. This article draws on reflections of the rural PHC response during the COVID-19 pandemic around three elements: risk, resilience, and response. Rural communities have nuanced risks related to their mobility and interaction patterns coupled with heightened population needs, socio-economic disadvantage, and access and health service infrastructure challenges. This requires specific risk assessment and communication which addresses the local context. Pandemic resilience relies on qualified and stable PHC teams using flexible responses and resources to enable streams of pandemic-related healthcare alongside ongoing primary healthcare. This depends on problem solving within limited resources and using networks and collaborations to enable healthcare for populations spread over large geographic catchments. PHC teams must secure systems for patient retrieval and managing equipment and resources including providing for situations where supply chains may fail and staff need rest. Response consists of rural PHC teams adopting new preventative clinics, screening and ambulatory models to protect health workers from exposure whilst maximizing population screening and continuity of healthcare for vulnerable groups. Innovative models that emerge during pandemics, including telehealth clinics, may bear specific evaluation for informing ongoing rural health system capabilities and patient access. It is imperative that mainstream pandemic policies recognize the nuance of rural settings and address resourcing and support strategies to each level of rural risk, resilience, and response for a strong health system ready for surge events.","O’sullivan, Belinda; Leader, Joelena; Couch, Danielle; Purnell, James",Risk Manage.

Therefore, they must employ protective measures. In practice, HCWs in Israel were not fully prepared for this sudden COVID-19 outbreak. This research aimed to identify and compare: (1) Israeli HCWs' perceptions regarding the official COVID-19 guidelines' applicability and their protective value, and (2) HCWs executives' response to HWCs' concern regarding personal protective equipment (PPE) shortage. METHODS: A mixed-methods sequential explanatory design consists of: (1) An online survey of 242 HCWs about the application of the guidelines and PPE, and (2) Personal interviews of 15 HCWs executives regarding PPE shortage and the measures they are taking to address it. RESULTS: A significant difference between the perceived applicability and protective value was found for most of the guidelines. Some of the guidelines were perceived as more applicable than protective (hand hygiene, signage at entrance, alcohol rub sanitizers at entrance, and mask for contact with symptomatic patients). Other were perceived as less applicable than protective (prohibited gathering of over 10 people, maintaining a distance of 2 m', and remote services). CONCLUSIONS: HCWs need the support of the healthcare authorities not only to provide missing equipment, but also to communicate the risk to them. Conveying the information with full transparency, while addressing the uncertainty element and engaging the HCWs in evaluating the guidelines, are critical for establishing trust.","Gesser-Edelsburg, Anat; Cohen, Ricky; Shahbari, Nour Abed Elhadi; Hijazi, Rana",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,371,5

However, the regulatory mechanism of hemi-methylated DNA binding activity of UHRF1 remains unknown. In this study, we reveal that acetylation of UHRF1 is regulated by PCAF and HDAC1. We show that UHRF1 acetylation at K490 attenuates its binding affinity to hemi-methylated DNA. We analyze genome-wide DNA methylation and gene-expression patterns using stable cell lines and discover that cells where the endogenous UHRF1 is replaced with an acetyl-mimetic (UHRF1 K490Q) mutant show deficiencies in inherited DNA methylation and show different gene-expression patterns in genes related to cell survival. These results reveal that precise regulation of UHRF1 acetylation is required to maintain DNA methylation during cell division and control cell survival.","Hahm, Ja Young; Park, Jin Woo; Kang, Joo-Young; Park, Junyoung; Kim, Chul-Hong; Kim, Ji-Young; Ha, Nam-Chul; Kim, Jung-Woong; Seo, Sang-Beom",Cell Rep,371,24

To date, no effective drug is available to directly treat the disease. In a search for a drug against COVID-19, we have performed a high-throughput x-ray crystallographic screen of two repurposing drug libraries against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), which is essential for viral replication. In contrast to commonly applied x-ray fragment screening experiments with molecules of low complexity, our screen tested already-approved drugs and drugs in clinical trials. From the three-dimensional protein structures, we identified 37 compounds that bind to Mpro. In subsequent cell-based viral reduction assays, one peptidomimetic and six nonpeptidic compounds showed antiviral activity at nontoxic concentrations. We identified two allosteric binding sites representing attractive targets for drug development against SARS-CoV-2.

However, limited test availability, high false-negative rates, and the existence of asymptomatic or subclinical infections have resulted in an undercounting of the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show how influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatient surveillance data can be used to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. We found a surge of non-influenza ILI above the seasonal average in March 2020 and showed that this surge correlated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case counts across states. If one-third of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States sought care, this ILI surge would have corresponded to more than 8.7 million new SARS-CoV-2 infections across the United States during the 3-week period from 8 to 28 March 2020. Combining excess ILI counts with the date of onset of community transmission in the United States, we also show that the early epidemic in the United States was unlikely to have been doubling slower than every 4 days. Together, these results suggest a conceptual model for the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States characterized by rapid spread across the United States with more than 80% infected individuals remaining undetected. We emphasize the importance of testing these findings with seroprevalence data and discuss the broader potential to use syndromic surveillance for early detection and understanding of emerging infectious diseases.","Silverman, Justin D; Hupert, Nathaniel; Washburne, Alex D",Sci. transl. med,371,16

Published studies on the reduction of SARS-CoV-2-induced cytotoxic effects by mouth rinses do not exclude antiseptic mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity. Here, we determined the effect of commercially available mouth rinses and antiseptic povidone-iodine on the infectivity of replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 viruses and of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viruses. We first determined the effect of mouth rinses on cell viability to ensure that antiviral activity was not a consequence of mouth rinse-induced cytotoxicity. Colgate Peroxyl (hydrogen peroxide) exhibited the most cytotoxicity, followed by povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), and Listerine (essential oils and alcohol). The potent antiviral activities of Colgate Peroxyl mouth rinse and povidone-iodine were the consequence of rinse-mediated cellular damage when the products were present during infection. The potency of CHG was greater when the product was not washed off after virus attachment, suggesting that the prolonged effect of mouth rinses on cells impacts the antiviral outcome. To minimalize mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity, mouth rinse was largely removed from treated viruses by centrifugation prior to infection of cells. A 5% (v/v) dilution of Colgate Peroxyl or povidone-iodine completely blocked viral infectivity. A similar 5% (v/v) dilution of Listerine or CHG had a moderate suppressive effect on the virus, but a 50% (v/v) dilution of Listerine or CHG blocked viral infectivity completely. Mouth rinses inactivated the virus without prolonged incubation. The new infectivity assay, with limited impacts of mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity, showed the differential effects of mouth rinses on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results indicate that mouth rinses can significantly reduce virus infectivity, suggesting a potential benefit for reducing SARS-CoV-2 spread.","Xu, Chuan; Wang, Annie; Hoskin, Eileen R; Cugini, Carla; Markowitz, Kenneth; Chang, Theresa L; Fine, Daniel H",,371,1

No data have been so far reported on the prognostic impact of RASI in patients suffering from ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) during COVID-19 pandemic, which was the aim of the present study. METHODS: STEMI patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) and enrolled in the ISACS-STEMI COVID-19 registry were included in the present sub-analysis and divided according to RASI therapy at admission. RESULTS: Our population is represented by 6095 patients, of whom 3654 admitted in 2019 and 2441 in 2020. No difference in the prevalence of SARSCoV2 infection was observed according to RASI therapy at admission (2.5% vs 2.1%, p = 0.5), which was associated with a significantly lower mortality (adjusted OR [95% CI]=0.68 [0.51-0.90], P = 0.006), confirmed in the analysis restricted to 2020 (adjusted OR [95% CI]=0.5[0.33-0.74], P = 0.001). Among the 5388 patients in whom data on in-hospital medication were available, in-hospital RASI therapy was associated with a significantly lower mortality (2.1% vs 16.7%, OR [95% CI]=0.11 [0.084-0.14], p < 0.0001), confirmed after adjustment in both periods. Among the 62 SARSCoV-2 positive patients, RASI therapy, both at admission or in-hospital, showed no prognostic effect. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to investigate the impact of RASI therapy on the prognosis and SARSCoV2 infection of STEMI patients undergoing PPCI during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both pre-admission and in-hospital RASI were associated with lower mortality. Among SARSCoV2-positive patients, both chronic and in-hospital RASI therapy showed no impact on survival.","De Luca, Giuseppe; Cercek, Miha; Okkels Jensen, Lisette; Bushljetikj, Oliver; Calmac, Lucian; Johnson, Tom; Gracida Blancas, Montserrat; Ganyukov, Vladimir; Wojakowski, Wojtek; von Birgelen, Clemens; IJsselmuiden, Alexander; Tuccillo, Bernardo; Versaci, Francesco; Ten Berg, Jurrien; Laine, Mika; Berkout, Tim; Casella, Gianni; Kala, Petr; López Ledesma, Bernabé; Becerra, Victor; Padalino, Roberto; Santucci, Andrea; Carrillo, Xavier; Scoccia, Alessandra; Amoroso, Giovanni; Lux, Arpad; Kovarnik, Tomas; Davlouros, Periklis; Gabrielli, Gabriele; Flores Rios, Xacobe; Bakraceski, Nikola; Levesque, Sébastien; Guiducci, Vincenzo; Kidawa, Michal; Marinucci, Lucia; Zilio, Filippo; Galasso, Gennaro; Fabris, Enrico; Menichelli, Maurizio; Manzo, Stephane; Caiazzo, Gianluca; Moreu, Jose; Sanchis Forés, Juan; Donazzan, Luca; Vignali, Luigi; Teles, Rui; Agostoni, Pierfrancesco; Bosa Ojeda, Francisco; Lehtola, Heidi; Camacho-Freiere, Santiago",Biomed Pharmacother,371,16

New vaccines are a potential way forward to reduce transmission rates and subsequent infection. In Brazil, vaccines are being distributed via the public sector; however, in the future, they will be available in the private market. Information about consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for a hypothetical vaccine against SARS CoV-2 can help future price setting discussions. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with consumers in the five regions of Brazil regarding the WTP for a hypothetical vaccine against SARS CoV-2 with a 50% efficacy. RESULTS: A total of 1402 individuals over 18 years of age who declared not having COVID-19 at the time of the survey were interviewed. The acceptability for this hypothetical vaccine was 80.7%. In addition, the amount of WTP by Brazilian consumers for a hypothetical SARS CoV-2 vaccine was estimated at US$ 22.18(120.00 BRL). CONCLUSION: This study can contribute to decision-making to inform potential pricing for a hypothetical SARS CoV-2 vaccine.","Dias-Godói, Isabella Piassi; Tadeu Rocha Sarmento, Túlio; Afonso Reis, Edna; Peres Gargano, Ludmila; Godman, Brian; de Assis Acurcio, Francisco; Alvares-Teodoro, Juliana; Guerra Júnior, Augusto Afonso; Mariano Ruas, Cristina",Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res,371,26

Surgical care has been impacted, with concerns raised around surgical safety, especially in terms of laparoscopic versus open surgery. Due to potential aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, precautions during aerosol-generating procedures and production of surgical plume are paramount for the safety of surgical teams. METHODS: A rapid review methodology was used with evidence sourced from PubMed, Departments of Health, surgical colleges and other health authorities. From this, a working group of expert surgeons developed recommendations for surgical safety in the current environment. RESULTS: Pre-operative testing of surgical patients with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction does not guarantee lack of infectivity due to a demonstrated false-negative rate of up to 30%. All bodily tissues and fluids should therefore be treated as a potential source of COVID-19 infection during operative management. Caution must be taken, especially when using an energy source that produces surgical plumes, and an appropriate capture device should also be used. Limiting the use of such devices or using lower energy devices is desirable. To reduce perceived risks association with desufflation of pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery, an appropriate suction irrigator system, attached to a high-efficiency particulate air filter, should be used. Additionally, appropriate use of personal protective equipment by the surgical team is necessary during high-risk aerosol-generating procedures. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the rapid review, evidence-based guidance has been produced to support safe surgical practice.","Tivey, David R; Davis, Sean S; Kovoor, Joshua G; Babidge, Wendy J; Tan, Lorwai; Hugh, Thomas J; Collinson, Trevor G; Hewett, Peter J; Padbury, Robert T A; Maddern, Guy J",ANZ J Surg,371,15

METHOD: A search of current literature on the COVID-19 crisis, and topics relevant to the mental health components associated with the pandemic are reviewed. Telemental health (TMH) and PMHNP practice are discussed as they relate to the unfolding picture of the viral pandemic. RESULTS: The COVID-19 crisis is having far-reaching implications for mental health treatment and in particular for PMHNPs in practice settings. There have been widespread consequences of the containment measures used for the protection and mitigation of the disease. One such result has been the inability of patients to have face-to-face contact with their providers. The role of TMH has become increasingly important as an adaptation in professional practice. CONCLUSION: Technology has rapidly transformed traditional practice due to the COVID-19 crisis and there is strong evidence that it is well accepted by patients and providers. It is incumbent on PMHNPs to embrace TMH and become educated on best practices and TMH services.","Schroeder, Rebecca A",J Am Psychiatr Nurses Assoc,371,21

Previous studies showed that comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 are risk factors for adverse outcomes. This study aimed to clarify the association between nervous system diseases and severity or mortality in patients with COVID-19. We performed a systematic literature search of four electronic databases and included studies reporting the prevalence of nervous system diseases in COVID-19 patients with severe and non-severe disease or among survivors and non-survivors. The included studies were pooled into a meta-analysis to calculate the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). We included 69 studies involving 17 879 patients. The nervous system diseases were associated with COVID-19 severity (OR = 3.19, 95%CI: 2.37 to 4.30, P < 0.001) and mortality (OR = 3.75, 95%CI: 2.68 to 5.25, P < 0.001). Specifically, compared with the patients without cerebrovascular disease, patients with cerebrovascular disease infected with COVID-19 had a higher risk of severity (OR = 3.10, 95%CI: 2.21 to 4.36, P < 0.001) and mortality (OR = 3.45, 95% CI: 2.46 to 4.84, P < 0.001). Stroke was associated with severe COVID-19 disease (OR = 1.95, 95%CI: 1.11 to 3.42, P = 0.020). No significant differences were found for the prevalence of epilepsy (OR = 1.00, 95%CI: 0.42 to 2.35, P = 0.994) and dementia (OR = 2.39, 95%CI: 0.55 to 10.48, P = 0.247) between non-severe and severe COVID-19 patients. There was no significant association between stroke (OR = 1.79, 95%CI: 0.76 to 4.23, P = 0.185), epilepsy (OR = 2.08, 95%CI: 0.08 to 50.91, P = 0.654) and COVID-19 mortality. In conclusion, nervous system diseases and cerebrovascular disease were associated with severity and mortality of patients with COVID-19. There might be confounding factors that influence the relationship between nervous system diseases and COVID-19 severity as well as mortality.","Gao, Ya; Chen, Yamin; Liu, Ming; Niu, Mingming; Song, Ziwei; Yan, Meili; Tian, Jinhui",Epidemiol Infect,371,1

However, it often suffers two major difficulties in real-world applications: 1) only limited labels are available for model training, due to expensive annotation costs over medical images; 2) labeled images may contain considerable label noise (e.g., mislabeling labels) due to diagnostic difficulties of diseases. To address these, we seek to exploit rich labeled data from relevant domains to help the learning in the target task via {Unsupervised Domain Adaptation} (UDA). Unlike most UDA methods that rely on clean labeled data or assume samples are equally transferable, we innovatively propose a Collaborative Unsupervised Domain Adaptation algorithm, which conducts transferability-aware adaptation and conquers label noise in a collaborative way. We theoretically analyze the generalization performance of the proposed method, and also empirically evaluate it on both medical and general images. Promising experimental results demonstrate the superiority and generalization of the proposed method.","Zhang, Yifan; Wei, Ying; Wu, Qingyao; Zhao, Peilin; Niu, Shuaicheng; Huang, Junzhou; Tan, Mingkui",,371,20

However, it is possible that even with an optimal use of the increased resources, these will not suffice for all patients in need. Therefore, recommendations for the allocation of intensive care resources in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic have been developed by a multidisciplinary group of authors with the support of eight scientific medical societies. The recommendations for procedures and criteria for prioritisations in case of resource scarcity are based on scientific evidence, ethicolegal considerations and practical experience. Medical decisions must always be based on the need and the treatment preferences of the individual patient. In addition to this patient-centred approach, prioritisations in case of resource scarcity require a supraindividual perspective. In such situations, prioritisations should be based on the criterion of clinical prospect of success in order to minimize the number of preventable deaths due to resource scarcity and to avoid discrimination based on age, disabilities or social factors. The assessment of the clinical prospect of success should take into account the severity of the current illness, severe comorbidities and the patient's general health status prior to the current illness.","Marckmann, Georg; Neitzke, Gerald; Schildmann, Jan; Michalsen, Andrej; Dutzmann, Jochen; Hartog, Christiane; Jöbges, Susanne; Knochel, Kathrin; Michels, Guido; Pin, Martin; Riessen, Reimer; Rogge, Annette; Taupitz, Jochen; Janssens, Uwe",Med.

The present article reviews behavioural, psychopharmacological and neuroanatomical evidence accumulated along more than fifty years that provides strong support to the contention that anxiety is critical in the transition from CS (conditioned stimulus)-induced freezing to escape/avoidance responses during the initial stages of TWAA acquisition. Thus, anxiolytic drugs of different types accelerate avoidance acquisition, anxiogenic drugs impair it, and avoidance during these initial acquisition stages is negatively associated with other typical measures of anxiety. In addition behavioural and developmental treatments that reduce or increase anxiety/stress respectively facilitate or impair TWAA acquisition. Finally, evidence for the regulation of TWAA acquisition by septo-hippocampal and amygdala-related mechanisms is discussed. Collectively, the reviewed evidence gives support to the initial acquisition of TWAA as a paradigm with considerable predictive and (in particular) construct validity as an approach-avoidance conflict-based rodent anxiety model.","Fernández-Teruel, Alberto; Tobeña, Adolf",Neurosci. biobehav. rev,371,15

In particular, we show that a flux of circularly polarized gravitational waves triggers the spontaneous creation of photons with net circular polarization from the quantum vacuum. Using waveform catalogs, we identify precessing binary black holes as astrophysical configurations that emit such gravitational radiation and then solve the fully nonlinear Einstein's equations with numerical relativity to evaluate the net effect. The quantum amplitude for a merger is comparable to the Hawking emission rate of the final black hole and small to be directly observed. However, the implications for the inspiral of binary neutron stars could be more prominent, as argued on symmetry grounds.","Del Rio, Adrian; Sanchis-Gual, Nicolas; Mewes, Vassilios; Agullo, Ivan; Font, José A; Navarro-Salas, Jose",Phys Rev Lett,371,16

The ambient temperatures covered a range from -30 to 50 degrees C. The solid PN emissions were 10 times lower than the PN limit under most conditions and temperatures. Only dynamic driving that regenerated the filter passively, and for the next cycle resulted in relatively high emissions although they were still below the limit.

Currently, SARS-CoV-2 serology is performed using serum/plasma collected by venepuncture. Dried bloodspot (DBS) testing offers significant advantages; as it is minimally invasive, avoids venepuncture with specimens being mailed to the laboratory. METHODS: A pathway utilising a newborn screening laboratory infrastructure was developed using an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in DBS specimens. Paired plasma and DBS specimens from SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive and negative subjects and PCR positive subjects were tested. DBS specimen stability, effect of blood volume and punch location were also evaluated. RESULTS: DBS from antibody-negative (n=85) and positive (n=35) subjects and PCR positive subjects (n=11) had a mean (SD; range) optical density (OD) of 0.14 (0.046; 0.03-0.27), 0.98 (0.41; 0.31-1.64) and 1.12 (0.37; 0.49-1.54), respectively. An action value OD >0.28 correctly assigned all cases. The weighted Deming regression for comparison of the DBS and the plasma assay yielded: y=0.004041+1.005x, r=0.991, Sy/x 0.171, n=82. Extraction efficiency of antibodies from DBS was >99%. DBS were stable for at least 28 days at ambient room temperature and humidity. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG RBD antibodies can be reliably detected in DBS. DBS serological testing offers lower costs than either point of care or serum/plasma assays that require patient travel, phlebotomy and hospital/clinic resources; the development of a DBS assay may be particularly important for resource poor settings.","Moat, Stuart James; Zelek, Wiola M; Carne, Emily; Ponsford, Mark J; Bramhall, Kathyryn; Jones, Sara; El-Shanawany, Tariq; Wise, Matthew J; Thomas, Annette; George, Chloe; Fegan, Christopher; Steven, Rachael; Webb, Russell; Weeks, Ian; Morgan, Brian Paul; Jolles, Stephen",Ann Clin Biochem,371,21

Many respiratory viruses bind to glycans on the heavily glycosylated mucins that give mucus its gel-like characteristics. Influenza viruses, some paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses avoid becoming trapped in the mucus by releasing themselves by means of their envelope-embedded enzymes that destroy glycan receptors. For efficient infection, receptor binding and destruction need to be in balance with the host receptor repertoire. Establishment in a novel host species requires resetting of the balance to adapt to the different glycan repertoire encountered. Growing understanding of species-specific mucosal glycosylation patterns and the dynamic interaction with respiratory viruses identifies the mucus layer as a major host-range determinant and barrier for zoonotic transfer.","Wallace, Louisa E; Liu, Mengying; van Kuppeveld, Frank J M; de Vries, Erik; de Haan, Cornelis A M",Trends microbiol,371,16

Az elmúlt hónapokban életünket alapvetoen megváltoztatta a COVID-19-pandémia, melynek egészségügyi, gazdasági és társadalmi hatásai egyelore szinte felbecsülhetetlenek. A vírusfertozés akut következményei mellett egyre több adat bizonyítja a teljes népességre kifejtett hatásait: a pszichológiai distressz, a depressziós és szorongásos tünetek, valamint az addiktív viselkedésformák gyakoriságának növekedését. Az is nagyon fontos kérdés, hogy a globális válsághelyzet hogyan befolyásolja az öngyilkossági arányszámokat. Írásomban az elmúlt idoszak legjelentosebb pszichiátriai szakirodalma alapján foglalom össze a vírusfertozés akut és krónikus hatásait, valamint a járványhelyzet általános és specifikus pszichológiai-pszichopatológiai következményeit, kiemelt figyelmet fordítva a suicidiumrizikóra és a leginkább veszélyeztetett csoportokra. A vizsgálatok arra utalnak, hogy a pandémia következtében kialakuló mentális gondok és a suicid viselkedés egyre fontosabb népegészségügyi problémává válnak. Bár napjainkban még a vírusfertozöttek gyógyítása és a fertozés terjedésének lassítása a legfontosabb cél, mindannyiunknak fel kell készülnünk a járvány hosszú távú következményeire.

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(10): 366-374. Summary. In recent months, our lives have been fundamentally changed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the health, economic, and social impacts of which are almost invaluable for the time being. In addition to the acute consequences of viral infection, more and more data are proving its effects on the entire population: an increase in the incidence of psychological distress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and addictive behaviours. It is also a very important question, how the global crisis is affecting suicide rates. In my paper, I summarize the acute and chronic effects of viral infection and the general and specific psychological-psychopathological consequences of the epidemic based on the most significant psychiatric literature of the recent period, paying special attention to suicidal risk and the most vulnerable groups. Studies suggest that mental troubles and suicidal behaviour resulting from a pandemic are becoming an increasingly important public health problem. Although the treatment of viral infections and slowing the spread of the infection are still the most important goals today, we all need to be prepared for the long-term consequences of the epidemic. In order to prevent and mitigate the expected negative mental health effects of a pandemic, it is necessary to develop and apply general and specific methods. In addition to health care, mental health and community care systems, political and economic decision-makers, civil society organizations and the media must also play a role. Their effective cooperation is key to the implementation of prevention strategies that can be applied at the individual, community and social levels, as this is the only way to prevent the epidemic spread of more serious mental health problems, the ""psychodemia"".

The spike protein of Kappa contains four mutations E154K, L452R, E484Q and P681R, and Delta contains L452R, T478K and P681R, while B.1.618 spike harbors mutations {Delta}145-146 and E484K. However, it remains unknown whether these variants have altered in their entry efficiency, host tropism, and sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies as well as entry inhibitors. In this study, we found that Kappa, Delta or B.1.618 spike uses human ACE2 with no or slightly increased efficiency, while gains a significantly increased binding affinity with mouse, marmoset and koala ACE2 orthologs, which exhibits limited binding with WT spike. Furthermore, the P618R mutation leads to enhanced spike cleavage, which could facilitate viral entry. In addition, Kappa, Delta and B.1.618 exhibits a reduced sensitivity to neutralization by convalescent sera owning to the mutation of E484Q, T478K, {Delta}145-146 or E484K, but remains sensitive to entry inhibitors-ACE2-lg decoy receptor. Collectively, our study revealed that enhanced human and mouse ACE2 receptor engagement, increased spike cleavage and reduced sensitivity to neutralization antibodies of Kappa, Delta and B.1.618 may contribute to the rapid spread of these variants and expanded host range. Furthermore, our result also highlighted that ACE2-lg could be developed as broad-spectrum antiviral strategy against SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Ren, Wenlin; Ju, Xiaohui; Gong, Mingli; Lan, Jun; Yu, Yanying; Long, Quanxin; Zhang, Yu; Zhong, Jin; Zhong, Guocai; Wang, Xinquan; Huang, Ailong; Zhang, Rong; Ding, Qiang",,371,21

The extent to which schools contribute to the overall propagation of SARS-CoV-2 was continuing to evolve internationally. AIMS: To examine regional data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in primary, post-primary and special schools in Cork and Kerry, two counties in southwest Ireland, during the first 6 weeks of the 2020-2021 academic year and determine the rate of in-school transmission. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) system and supplemented with digital records from the regional Department of Public Health (Dept PH) and from the Health Service Executive (HSE) Covid Care Tracker application. The positivity rate among school close contacts was calculated to determine the rate of in-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission. RESULTS: The overall rate of in-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was low at 4.1%. Positivity rates among students and staff who were close contacts were similarly low (3.1% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.07). One secondary case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged, on average, for every 7.6 infectious days spent by an index case in school. Schools accounted for 2.2% of all notified cases of COVID-19 in the region during the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: During the first 6 weeks of the academic year, the rate of in-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the region was low, and schools did not contribute substantially to the overall burden of COVID-19.","White, Philippa; O039,; Sullivan, Margaret Bernadette; Murphy, Nicola; Stapleton, Jane; Dillon, Annette; Brennan, Aline; Deasy, Benvon; Carlton, Louise; Bermingham, Áine; Mahony, Mary Teresa; Murray, Deirdre; Nolan, Cliodhna Foley; Sheahan, Anne",Ir. j. med. sci,371,16

The basic reproductive rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 2·5 (range 1·8-3·6) compared with 2·0-3·0 for SARS-CoV and the 1918 influenza pandemic, 0·9 for MERS-CoV, and 1·5 for the 2009 influenza pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 causes mild or asymptomatic disease in most cases; however, severe to critical illness occurs in a small proportion of infected individuals, with the highest rate seen in people older than 70 years. The measured case fatality rate varies between countries, probably because of differences in testing strategies. Population-based mortality estimates vary widely across Europe, ranging from zero to high. Numbers from the first affected region in Italy, Lombardy, show an all age mortality rate of 154 per 100â000 population. Differences are most likely due to varying demographic structures, among other factors. However, this new virus has a focal dissemination; therefore, some areas have a higher disease burden and are affected more than others for reasons that are still not understood. Nevertheless, early introduction of strict physical distancing and hygiene measures have proven effective in sharply reducing R0 and associated mortality and could in part explain the geographical differences.","Petersen, Eskild; Koopmans, Marion; Go, Unyeong; Hamer, Davidson H; Petrosillo, Nicola; Castelli, Francesco; Storgaard, Merete; Al Khalili, Sulien; Simonsen, Lone",Lancet Infect Dis,371,22

DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 participants between June and August 2020 who indicated their willingness to participate in an interview following a national survey. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim by professional transcribers. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The importance of professional and public support and acknowledgement of the nurses' role during the pandemic positively influenced feelings of being valued. The psychological impact of negative experiences increased anxiety and stress levels. Participants reported a range of self-care strategies, including increased vigilance with infection control at home and work and attention to physical exercise and diet. Most participants remained positive about their roles and career decisions, although some indicated that the negative psychological impacts prompted re-evaluation of their career. CONCLUSIONS: Primary healthcare nurses have been exposed to a range of personal and professional stressors during the pandemic that have impacted their psychological well-being. Awareness of stressors and an understanding of what has helped and what has impacted well-being are important in guiding future workplace support systems. Further work to explore the long-term impact of these stressors and the effectiveness of coping strategies employed by primary healthcare nurses is warranted. IMPACT: Managers and professional organisations need to consider the personal and professional stressors that have impacted on primary healthcare nurses' psychological well-being to promote health and well-being among nurses following COVID-19.","Ashley, Christine; James, Sharon; Williams, Anna; Calma, Kaara; Mcinnes, Susan; Mursa, Ruth; Stephen, Catherine; Halcomb, Elizabeth",J. adv. nurs,371,1

Based on rationing principles and protocols proposed in ethical and medical literature the authors explore how Portuguese general public evaluates the fairness of five allocation principles: ""prognosis"", ""severity of health condition"", ""patients age"", ""instrumental value"" (frontline healthcare professionals should be prioritized during the pandemic) and ""lottery"". DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: An online questionnaire was used to collect data from a sample of 586 Portuguese citizens. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests were used to define a hierarchy of prioritization criteria and to test for the association between respondents support to them and their socio-demographic and health characteristics. FINDINGS: Respondents gave top priority to prognosis when faced with absolute scarcity, followed closely by the severity of health condition, patient's age with instrumental value receiving lowest support, on average. However, when the age of the patients was confronted with survival, younger-first principle prevailed over recovery. In a pandemic context, lottery was considered the least fair allocation method. The findings suggest that respondents' opinions are aligned with those of ethicists but are partially in disagreement with the protocol suggested for Portugal. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This study represents the first attempt to elicit public attitudes towards distributive criteria during a pandemic and, therefore, in a real context where the perception is that life and death decisions have to be made.","Pinho, Micaela",J. health organ. manag,371,16

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe critical care nurses' experiences of caring for critically ill patients with artificial airways during interhospital transfers. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study using a qualitative approach was conducted during spring 2020. Participants were critical care nurses (n = 7) from different hospitals (n = 2). METHODS: The data were collected through semi-structured interviews based on an interview guide. A qualitative content analysis using an inductive approach was performed. RESULTS: The analysis resulted in one main theme, ""Preserving the safety in an unknown environment,"" and three sub-themes, ""Being adequately prepared is essential to feel secure,"" ""Feeling abandoned and overwhelmingly responsible,"" and ""Being challenged in an unfamiliar and risky environment."" CONCLUSIONS: Critical care nurses experienced interhospital transfers of critically ill patients with artificial airways as complex and risky. It is essential to have an overall plan in order to prevent any unpredictable and acute events. Adequate communication and good teamwork are key to the safe transfer of a critically ill patient in that potential complications and dangers to the patient can be prevented. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Standardized checklists need to be created to guide the transfers of critically ill patients with different conditions.

The entry of 3PPs into supply chains, not only changes the cash flow, but also decreases consumer price sensitivity and stimulates demand by facilitating credit consumptions. Moreover, information sharing becomes more feasible with the help of 3PPs. To study the impacts of 3PP entry, we build game-theoretic models in a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, a retailer and a 3PP, and derive the equilibrium in both the non-information sharing and information sharing cases. We show that the 3PP should make a reasonable commission rate which can lure the retailer to introduce the 3PP as well as maintain the 3PP's profitability. The 3PP entry allows the retailer to set a higher price without decreasing the demand. However, to seize all of the benefit of the 3PP entry, the first mover manufacturer increases the wholesale price to a large extent. As a result, the 3PP entry causes a win-lose situation for the manufacturer and the retailer. The supply chain can be better off from the 3PP entry if it can significantly decrease consumer price sensitivity or its fixed investment cost is low. Furthermore, we find that information sharing benefits the manufacturer and the 3PP but harms the retailer. While information sharing always decreases the expected profit for the supply chain without the 3PP, it may increase that for the supply chain with the 3PP. To improve the supply chain profitability, we suggest to provide incentives for retailer information sharing if the 3PP can significantly decrease consumer price sensitivity (i.e., the proportion of the 3PP users is higher, the grace period of credit consumption is lower, or the cash opportunity cost is lower).","Fan, Xiaojun; Zhao, Wenyu; Zhang, Ting; Yan, Endian",Ann Oper Res,371,12

Wellens syndrome, or left anterior descending T-wave syndrome, is diagnosed by a pattern of electrocardiographic (ECG) changes that include inverted or biphasic T waves in leads V2-V3. CASE REPORT A 75-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of fatigue and progressive shortness of breath who acutely decompensated, necessitating mechanical ventilator support. Initial lab workup revealed COVID-19 positivity, which was confirmed by repeat testing. A routine ECG obtained during her hospitalization and compared with her baseline revealed diffuse T-wave inversions of her precordial leads, which was highly suggestive of Wellens syndrome. Cardiac enzymes obtained were slightly elevated and an echocardiogram did not demonstrate wall motion abnormalities. The patient was initiated on non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction protocol with heparin infusion for 48 hours and dual antiplatelet therapy, in addition to beta blockade. Repeat ECGs showed complete resolution of Wellens syndrome shortly after therapy. CONCLUSIONS Although rare, Wellens syndrome is a significant indicator of left anterior descending artery stenosis and is commonly associated with acute medical illness. COVID-19 pneumonia has been associated with many adverse cardiovascular outcomes, with ischemia and arrhythmia becoming increasingly more common. Diagnosis of Wellens often includes coronary angiography; however, during the current pandemic, many authorities have recommended medical management alone during the acute phase of care, depending on the severity of concomitant illness.","Prousi, George S; Giordano, Jacob; McCann, Patrick J",Am J Case Rep,371,1

In this regard, as seen in earlier epidemics, testing has always been an integral part of containment policy. But one has to consider the optimality of a testing scheme based on the resultant disease spread in the community and not based on purely increasing testing efficiency. Therefore, taking a decision is no easy feat and must consider the community utility constrained by its priorities, budget, risks, collateral and abilities which can be encoded into the optimization of the strategy. We thus propose a simple pooling strategy that is easy to customize and practical to implement, unlike other complex and computationally intensive methods.","Dheeshjith, Surya; Enaganti, Inavamsi; Mishra, Bud",,371,22

Stress has become an important concern in education since the COVID-19 outbreak. This descriptive-correlational online survey administered in August 2020 utilized the COVID-19 Perceived Stress Scale (COVID-19 PSS-10) to assess the COVID-19 perceived stress among employed Filipino teachers. Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tested for differences while Spearman's rho was used to analyze the correlation between variables. Results demonstrated that more than half of teachers experienced moderate COVID-19 stress. Females experienced significantly higher COVID-19 stress compared to males. A negative correlation was noted between self-rated health and COVID-19 stress while a positive correlation was found between the perceive risk of getting COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 stress. This study highlights that steps must be undertaken to help teachers deal with the stress of the COVID-19 crisis as well as they must be provided or taught with stress management interventions during this pandemic. This study could be used as a baseline for future research to assess the impact of COVID-19 stress among professional teachers.,"Oducado, R. M. F.; Rabacal, J. S.; Moralista, R. B.; Tamdang, K.

In this study, we sought to determine the prevalence of autoimmune antibodies in diverse cohort of SARS-CoV-2 positive healthcare workers and measure the extent to which factors associated with triggered autoimmunity are activated even following mild and asymptomatic infection. MethodsAntigen microarrays were used to profile reactivity of IgG autoantibodies against 91 proteins and cytokines based on autoantibody profiling studies in autoimmune diseases. ResultsIn this discovery screening study, we found that 90% of the IgG positive individuals demonstrated reactivity to at least one autoantibody. When compared to results of the same assays conducted on samples from pre-COVID-19 controls, our primary cohort of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody positivity had significantly elevated IgG against twelve additional proteins including CHD3, CTLA4, HARS, IFNA4, INS, MIF, MX1, RNF41, S100A9, SRP19, TROVE2, and VEGFA. These findings confirmed that all severity levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection, even asymptomatic infections, trigger a robust and diverse autoimmune response; our results also highlight the utility of multiparametric autoantibody detection in this setting. InterpretationTaken together, our findings underscore the serological diversity underlying the clinical heterogeneity of COVID-19 infection and its sequelae, including the long-Covid phenotypes.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSCurrently, several studies have shown the possible involvement of autoimmunity in patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In contrast to cytokine storms, which tend to cause systemic, short-duration problems, autoantibodies (AABs) are thought to result in targeted, longer-term damage and development of autoimmune diseases. Added value of this studyAccording to our knowledge, we evaluated the largest number of protein antigens to characterize the prevalence and heterogeneity of the AABs signature in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals. We examined autoimmune reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of extreme clinical disease to acknowledge the existence of AABs even among those who had mild-to-moderate or no symptoms during their illness, as a hallmark of ongoing long-COVID syndrome. Through our analysis we suggest that VEGFA, MIF, IFNA4, SPP1 and APOH could be used as hallmark for SARS-CoV-2 infection and activation of the autoimmune system. Implications of all the available evidenceOur study comprehensively characterized the heterogeneity of the AABs signature in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals. The results established a list of diagnostic signatures and potential therapeutic targets for long-Covid-19 patients although follow-up long-term studies are required. We believe that our findings will serve as a valuable resource, to drive further exploration of long-COVID syndrome pathogenesis.","Liu, Yunxian; Ebinger, Joseph E.; Mostafa, Rowann; Budde, Petra; Gajewski, Jana; Walker, Brian; Joung, Sandy; Bräutigam, Manuel; Hesping, Franziska; Schäefer, Elena; Schubert, Ann-Sophie; Zucht, Hans-Dieter; Melmed, Gil Y.; Sobhani, Kimia; Braun, Jonathan; McGovern, Dermot P.B.; Eyk, Jennifer E.

METHODS: Clinico-epidemiological and laboratory profile of children between 1 month and 14 years were studied between 15 May and 31 July 2020, who had positive nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: A total of 30 children with median age of 10.5 years (8 months to 14 years) were included in the present study. Sixty percent were boys. Twenty-seven (90%) belonged to an urban area and all 30 children were from a containment area. All were belonging to Kuppuswamy upper lower and lower socioeconomic class. Twenty-one (70%) were asymptomatic. All children had a positive household contact. Symptomatic children had only mild symptoms of fever, dry cough and rhinitis. All were fully vaccinated as per age. Nine (30%) had anaemia. The mean leucocyte count was 7470 ± 2427 (4300-14 100). Leucocytosis was seen in 3 (9%) children. C-reactive protein was found to be raised in only 4 (13%) children. We did not find alteration in sense of smell and taste. No mortality was reported. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 in paediatric patients is usually mild. Severe acute respiratory infection is not a major manifestation of COVID 19 infection in children. All children infected by the novel Corona virus-2 in this study, have a documented household contact.","Ramteke, Sharmila; Tikkas, Rajesh; Goel, Manjusha; Mandraha, Shipra; Shrivastava, Jyotsna",J. trop. pedriatr,371,4

However, it is difficult to determine priorities for maintaining different elements of existing HIV services given widespread uncertainty. Methods: We explore the impact of disruptions on HIV outcomes in South Africa, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Uganda using a mathematical model, examine how impact is affected by model assumptions, and compare potential HIV deaths to those that may be caused by COVID-19 in the same settings. Findings: The most important determinant of HIV-related mortality is an interruption to antiretroviral treatment (ART) supply. A three-month interruption for 40% of those on ART could cause a similar number of additional deaths as those that might be saved from COVID-19 through social distancing. An interruption for more than 6–90% of individuals on ART for nine months could cause the number of HIV deaths to exceed the number of COVID-19 deaths, depending on the COVID-19 projection. However, if ART supply is maintained, but new treatment, voluntary medical male circumcision, and pre-exposure prophylaxis initiations cease for 3 months and condom use is reduced, increases in HIV deaths would be limited to &lt;2% over five years, although this could still be accompanied by a 7% increase in new HIV infections. Interpretation: HIV deaths could increase substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic under reasonable worst-case assumptions about interruptions to HIV services.

Inhibition of cathepsin L is therefore considered an effective method to decrease the virus internalization. Analysis from the perspective of structure-functionality elucidates that cathepsin L inhibitory proteins/peptides found in food share specific features: multiple disulfide crosslinks (buried in protein core), lack or low contents of (small) &#945;-helices, and high surface hydrophobicity. Lactoferrin can inhibit cathepsin L, but not cathepsins B and H. This selective inhibition might be useful in fine targeting of cathepsin L. Molecular docking indicated that only the carboxyl-terminal lobe of lactoferrin interacts with cathepsin L and that the active site cleft of cathepsin L is heavily superposed by lactoferrin.

Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin D insufficiency is related to a higher risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the prospective association between habitual use of vitamin D supplements and risk of COVID-19 infection, and assess whether such an association differed according to the different levels of circulating and genetically predicted vitamin D. METHODS: This study included 8297 adults who have records of COVID-19 test results from UK Biobank (from 16 March 2020 to 29 June 2020). The use of vitamin D supplements, circulating vitamin D levels, and main covariates were measured at baseline (2006-2010). Genetically predicted vitamin D levels were evaluated by genetic risk score. RESULTS: After adjustment for covariates, the habitual use of vitamin D supplements was significantly associated with a 34% lower risk of COVID-19 infection (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45-0.97; P = 0.034). Circulating vitamin D levels at baseline or genetically predicted vitamin D levels were not associated with the risk of COVID-19 infection. The association between the use of vitamin D supplements and the risk of COVID-19 infection did not vary according to the different levels of circulating or genetically predicted vitamin D (P-interactions = 0.75 and 0.74, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that habitual use of vitamin D supplements is related to a lower risk of COVID-19 infection, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the inverse association is due to residual confounding or selection bias. Further clinical trials are needed to verify these results.","Ma, Hao; Zhou, Tao; Heianza, Yoriko; Qi, Lu",Am. j. clin. nutr,371,1

All hospitalized adult patients with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by rRT-PCR performed on a nasopharingeal sample from March 1 to March 18 in our institution were included. The study population was divided according to the Ct value obtained upon admission in patients with high viral load (Ct < 25), intermediate viral load (Ct: 25-30) and low viral load (Ct > 30). Demographic, clinical and laboratory variables of the different groups were analyzed to assess the influence of viral load on the development of respiratory failure during admission. Overall, 455 sequential patients were included. The median Ct value was 28 (IQR: 24-32). One hundred and thirty patients (28.6%) had a high viral load, 175 (38.5%) an intermediate viral load and 150 (33%) a low viral load. Advanced age, male sex, presence of cardiovascular disease and laboratory markers such as lactate dehydrogenase, lymphocyte count and C-reactive protein, as well as a high viral load on admission, were predictive of respiratory failure.

Social distancing and fever detection have been widely employed to counteract the COVID-19 pandemic, sparking great interest from academia, industry and public administrations worldwide. While most solutions have dealt with the two aspects separately, milliTRACE-IR combines, via a robust sensor fusion approach, mm-wave radars and infrared thermal cameras. The system achieves fully automated measurement of distancing and body temperature, by jointly tracking the faces of the subjects in the thermal camera image plane and the human motion in the radar reference system. It achieves decimeter-level accuracy in distance estimation, inter-personal distance estimation (effective for subjects getting as close as 0.2 m), and accurate temperature monitoring (max. errors of 0.5 C). Moreover, milliTRACE-IR performs contact tracing: a person with high body temperature is reliably detected by the thermal camera sensor and subsequently traced across a large indoor area in a non-invasive way by the radars. When entering a new room, this subject is re-identified among several other individuals with high accuracy (95%), by computing gait-related features from the radar reflections through a deep neural network and using a weighted extreme learning machine as the final re-identification tool.","Canil, Marco; Pegoraro, Jacopo; Rossi, Michele",,371,26

Using an orthopaedic elective surgery model, we aimed to answer the following: (1) What is the expected recovery time until the health-care system is back to nearly full capacity for performing elective surgery? (2) What will be the expected backlog of elective surgery over time? (3) How should health care change to address the backlog? METHODS: A Monte Carlo stochastic simulation-based analysis was performed to forecast the post-pandemic volume of elective, inpatient total joint arthroplasty and spinal fusion surgical cases. The cumulative backlog was calculated and analyzed. We tested model assumptions with sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Assuming that elective orthopaedic surgery resumes in June 2020, it will take 7, 12, and 16 months-in optimistic, ambivalent, and pessimistic scenarios, respectively-until the health-care system can perform 90% of the expected pre-pandemic forecasted volume of surgery. In the optimistic scenario, there will be a cumulative backlog of >1 million surgical cases at 2 years after the end of elective-surgery deferment. CONCLUSIONS: The deferment of elective surgical cases during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will have a lasting impact on the United States health-care system.

However, replicating vaccines are administered in and around pregnancy, either inadvertently because of unknown pregnancy status or when recommended.The historical cases of Ebola virus, yellow fever, and rubella demonstrate that contradictory messages around the safety of live vaccines in pregnancy have critical public health costs. First, restricting study or use of replicating vaccines in pregnancy may delay or deny access to the only available protection against deadly diseases. Additionally, not vaccinating pregnant people may slow epidemic control. Finally, uncertainty and worry around the safety of live vaccines may lead to terminations of otherwise desired pregnancies after inadvertent vaccination in pregnancy.If one of the vaccines deployed to combat the current global COVID-19 pandemic is replication competent, historical cases offer important lessons for ethical and effective protection for pregnant populations.","Jaffe, Elana; Goldfarb, Ilona Telefus; Lyerly, Anne Drapkin",Am J Public Health,371,20

To assess the seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in Allegheny County, an urban/suburban county in Western PA, 393 human blood samples collected in Fall 2020 and February 2021 were examined for spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (N) antibodies. All RBD-positive samples were evaluated for virus-specific neutralization activity. Our results showed a seroprevalence of 5.5% by RBD ELISA, 4.5% by N ELISA, and 2.5% for both in Fall 2020, which increased to 24.7% by RBD ELISA, 14.9% by N ELISA, and 12.9% for both in February 2021. Neutralization titer was significantly correlated with RBD titer but not with N titer. Using these two assays, we were able to distinguish infected from vaccinated individuals.

METHODS: We acquired information and data on general information on and infection and death status of HCWs in Wuhan during the COVID-19 outbreak and completed statistical analyses. RESULTS: We obtained the data on 2457 infected cases among HCWs in Wuhan, China. More than half of the infected individuals were nurses (52.06%), whereas 33.62% of infected cases were doctors and 14.33% of cases were medical staff. In particular, the case infection rate of nurses (2.22%) was remarkably higher than that of doctors (1.92%). Most infected cases among HCWs were female (72.28%). A majority of the infected HCWs (89.26%) came from general hospitals, followed by specialized hospitals (5.70%) and community hospitals (5.05%). The case infection rate of HCWs (2.10%) was dramatically higher than that of non-HCWs (0.43%). The case fatality rate of HCWs (0.69%) was significantly lower than that of non-HCWs (5.30%).

The study reveals that face-to-display work can save CO2 emissions by reducing work-related trips. The data obtained offer a stimulating view of potential carbon emissions savings if employees continue working from home. Additionally, further saving factors correlate with the findings of this study, in particular decreases in energy consumption. Based on the data received, after the easing of the lockdown period, full e-workers mitigated the extent of their carbon footprint by almost 62% because of transport emissions. Moreover, in that period, 126 072 kg of CO2 emission of energy consumption was saved. Generally, the results indicate that an increase of e-workers tends to decrease the footprint from transport emissions and energy consumption. This paper finds that workers working remotely decrease the carbon foot print as a result of zero commuting and energy consumption during different periods of the Covid-19 pandemic. The findings show that more long-term and comprehensive studies are needed, especially in relation to e-workers who have invested in lower-emission home offices. This study has contributed to highlighting the environmental benefit of reducing CO2 emissions of face-to-display workers by not commuting to work. The findings are based on data from an international Austrian company. © 2021 Michal Beno.

Laboratory and observational data suggested that hydroxychloroquine had biological activity against SARS-CoV-2, potentially permitting its use for prevention. OBJECTIVE: To test hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: Household-randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine postexposure prophylaxis. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04328961). SETTING: National U.S. multicenter study. PARTICIPANTS: Close contacts recently exposed (<96 hours) to persons with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. INTERVENTION: Hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/d for 3 days followed by 200 mg/d for 11 days) or ascorbic acid (500 mg/d followed by 250 mg/d) as a placebo-equivalent control. MEASUREMENTS: Participants self-collected mid-turbinate swabs daily (days 1 to 14) for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed incident SARS-CoV-2 infection among persons who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at enrollment. RESULTS: Between March and August 2020, 671 households were randomly assigned: 337 (407 participants) to the hydroxychloroquine group and 334 (422 participants) to the control group. Retention at day 14 was 91%, and 10 724 of 11 606 (92%) expected swabs were tested. Among the 689 (89%) participants who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline, there was no difference between the hydroxychloroquine and control groups in SARS-CoV-2 acquisition by day 14 (53 versus 45 events; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.66]; P > 0.20). The frequency of participants experiencing adverse events was higher in the hydroxychloroquine group than the control group (66 [16.2%] versus 46 [10.9%], respectively; P = 0.026). LIMITATION: The delay between exposure, and then baseline testing and the first dose of hydroxychloroquine or ascorbic acid, was a median of 2 days. CONCLUSION: This rigorous randomized controlled trial among persons with recent exposure excluded a clinically meaningful effect of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The aims of the current study were to (1) document the breadth of COVID-19 experiences and their impacts on college students of a minority-serving academic institution in NYC; (2) explore associations between patterns of COVID-19 experiences and psychosocial functioning during the prolonged lockdown, and (3) explore sex and racial/ethnic differences in COVID-19-related experiences and mental health correlates. A total of 909 ethnically and racially diverse students completed an online survey in May 2020. Findings highlight significant impediments to multiple areas of students' daily life during this period (i.e., home life, work life, social environment, and emotional and physical health) and a vast majority reported heightened symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety. These life disruptions were significantly related to poorer mental health. Moreover, those who reported the loss of a close friend or loved one from COVID-19 (17%) experienced significantly more psychological distress than counterparts with other types of infection-related histories. Nonetheless, the majority (96%) reported at least one positive experience since the pandemic began. Our findings add to a growing understanding of COVID-19 impacts on psychological health and contribute the important perspective of the North American epicenter of the pandemic during the time frame of this investigation. We discuss how the results may inform best practices to support students' well-being and serve as a benchmark for future studies of US student populations facing COVID-19 and its aftermath.","López-Castro, Teresa; Brandt, Laura; Anthonipillai, Nishanthi J; Espinosa, Adriana; Melara, Robert",PLoS One,371,1

As our species and planet respond to current unprecedented times, opportunities emerge that encourage educational shifts toward ecological sustainability. We argue that education must not be accepting of the plague of indifference because that is to be complicitous with it. As such, this paper explores opportunities to destabilize the enduring assumptions of indifference towards ecological sustainability within humanistic education, while building capacities to see beyond these assumptions.

The method employs high sensitivity and selectivity targeted mass spectrometry detection, monitoring nine constitutive peptides representative of the three main viral proteins and a straightforward pellet digestion protocol for convenient routine applications. Absolute quantification of N, M, and S proteins was achieved by addition of isotope-labeled versions of best peptides. Limit of detection, recovery, precision, and linearity were thoroughly evaluated in four representative viral transport media (VTM) containing distinct total protein content. The protocol was sensitive in all swab media with limit of detection determined at 2 × 103 pfu/mL, corresponding to as low as 30 pfu injected into the LC-MS/MS system.

METHODS: A case series of adult patients hospitalized for 2 or more nights from May 15 to June 15, 2020 at large tertiary-care hospital in the midwestern United States was reviewed. All patients were screened at admission with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Selected adult patients were also tested by IgG serology. After dismissal, patients with negative serology and PCR at admission were asked to undergo repeat serologic testing at 14-21 days after discharge. The primary outcome was healthcare-associated COVID-19 defined as a new positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test on or after day 4 of hospital stay or within 7 days of hospital dismissal, or seroconversion in patients previously established as seronegative. RESULTS: Of the 2,068 eligible adult patients, 1,778 (86.0%) completed admission PCR testing, while 1,339 (64.7%) also completed admission serology testing. Of the 1,310 (97.8%) who were both PCR and seronegative, 445 (34.0%) repeated postdischarge serology testing. No healthcare-associated COVID-19 cases were detected during the study period. Of 1,310 eligible PCR and seronegative adults, no patients tested PCR positive during hospital admission (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0%-0.3%). Of the 445 (34.0%) who completed postdischarge serology testing, no patients seroconverted (0.0%; 95% CI, 0.0%-0.9%). CONCLUSION: We found low likelihood of hospital-associated COVID-19 with strict adherence to universal masking, physical distancing, and hand hygiene along with limited visitors and screening of admissions with PCR.","Habermann, Elizabeth B; Tande, Aaron J; Pollock, Benjamin D; Neville, Matthew R; Ting, Henry H; Sampathkumar, Priya",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,371,26

METHODS: Laboratory results and obstetrical outcomes of women with singleton gestations, admitted for delivery during the COVID-19 mask-wearing period (April-June 2020) were compared with those of women delivering during the parallel period in 2019 and with a larger cohort derived from nine pre-pandemic years (March 2011-April 2020). RESULTS: Overall, 1838 women delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with the pre-pandemic period, mean hemoglobin and fibrinogen levels were significantly higher during the mask-wearing period (12.15 ± 1.1 vs 11.96 ± 1.2, P < 0.001 and 472 ± 103.6 vs 448 ± 85.1 mg/dl, P < 0.001, respectively). Platelet levels were lower (200 ± 56.0 vs 206 ± 57.5 K/µl, P < 0.001). The rate of delivery at <34 weeks of gestation was lower during the mask-wearing period (1.1% vs 2%, odds ratio [OR] 0.57, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.37-0.88, P = 0.01), whereas cesarean delivery and postpartum hemorrhage rates were higher (26.7% vs 24.4%, OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.25, P = 0.022 and 4.1% vs 2.8%, OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8, P = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: A hard-to-ventilate space created by wearing a mask during the COVID-19 era may be the underlying cause of the observed higher hemoglobin level among pregnant women, possibly affecting obstetrical outcomes.","Friedrich, Lior; Levin, Gabriel; Maixner, Nitzan; Bart, Yossi; Tsur, Abraham; Yinon, Yoav; Meyer, Raanan",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,371,25

Early analyses indicated that baseline quality was not predictive of nursing home cases, but a more nuanced study of the role of nurse staffing is needed to target resources and better respond to future outbreaks. We sought to understand whether baseline nurse staffing is associated with the presence of COVID-19 in nursing homes and whether staffing impacts outbreak severity. DESIGN: We analyzed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) facility-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths merged with nursing home and county characteristics. We used logistic regressions to examine the associations of staffing levels from Nursing Home Compare with the outcomes of any COVID-19 cases and, conditional on at least one case, an outbreak. Among facilities with at least one case, we modeled count of deaths using hurdle negative binomial-2 regressions. SETTING: All nursing homes in the CMS COVID-19 Nursing Home Dataset with reports that passed the CMS Quality Assurance Check as of June 25, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of nursing homes that met COVID-19 reporting requirements. MEASUREMENTS: A nursing home is defined as having at least one case is if one or more confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case among residents or staff is reported. Conditional on at least one case, we examine two outcomes: an outbreak, defined as confirmed cases/certified beds >10% or total confirmed and suspected cases/beds >20% or >10 deaths, and the total number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 among residents and staff. RESULTS: A total of 71% of the 13,167 nursing homes that reported COVID-19 data as of June 14 had at least one case among residents and/or staff. Of those, 27% experienced an outbreak. Higher registered nurse-hours are associated with a higher probability of experiencing any cases. However, among facilities with at least one case, higher nurse aide (NA) hours and total nursing hours are associated with a lower probability of experiencing an outbreak and with fewer deaths. The strongest predictor of cases and outbreaks in nursing homes is per capita cases in the county. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of COVID-19 in the community remains the strongest predictor of COVID-19 cases and deaths in nursing homes, but higher NA hours and total nursing hours may help contain the number of cases and deaths.","Gorges, Rebecca J; Konetzka, R Tamara",J Am Geriatr Soc,371,1

The aim of the present study was to investigate the risk factors for acute UD after laparoscopic low anterior resection (LALAR) for rectal cancer in patients receiving epidural analgesia. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 131 patients who underwent LALAR among those receiving epidural analgesia in a single institution between October 2008 and December 2019. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the clinicopathological factors associated with acute UD. RESULTS: The overall incidence of acute UD was 16.0% (21/131). Univariate analysis showed that older age (P = 0.016) and earlier urinary catheter removal (P = 0.036) were associated with acute UD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that older age (10-year increments; odds ratio (OR) 2.046, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.171-3.543, P = 0.011), urinary catheter removal before epidural analgesia discontinuation (OR 6.393, 95% CI 1.540-26.534, P = 0.011), and a large tumor circumference rate (10% increments; OR 1.263, 95% CI 1.043-1.530, P = 0.017) were independent risk factors for acute UD. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that older age, early removal of urinal catheter before epidural analgesia discontinuation, and large tumor circumference rate are risk factors of acute UD after LALAR for rectal cancer in patients receiving epidural analgesia.","Hiraki, Masatsugu; Tanaka, Toshiya; Sadashima, Eiji; Sato, Hirofumi; Kitahara, Kenji",Int. j. colorectal. dis,371,10

Animal models that faithfully recapitulate human disease are critical for assessing SARS-CoV-2 viral and immune dynamics, for understanding mechanisms of disease, and for testing vaccines and therapeutics. Pigtail macaques (PTM, Macaca nemestrina) demonstrate a rapid and severe disease course when infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), including the development of severe cardiovascular symptoms that are pertinent to COVID-19 manifestations in humans. We thus proposed this species may likewise exhibit severe COVID-19 disease upon infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Pulmonary infiltrates were dominated by T cells, including CD4+ T cells that upregulate CD8 and express cytotoxic molecules, as well as virus-targeting T cells that were predominantly CD4+. We also noted increases in inflammatory and coagulation markers in blood, pulmonary pathologic lesions, and the development of neutralizing antibodies. Together, our data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection of PTM recapitulates important features of COVID-19 and reveals new immune and viral dynamics and thus may serve as a useful animal model for studying pathogenesis and testing vaccines and therapeutics.","Melton, Alexandra; Doyle-Meyers, Lara A; Blair, Robert V; Midkiff, Cecily; Melton, Hunter J; Russell-Lodrigue, Kasi; Aye, Pyone P; Schiro, Faith; Fahlberg, Marissa; Szeltner, Dawn; Spencer, Skye; Beddingfield, Brandon J; Goff, Kelly; Golden, Nadia; Penney, Toni; Picou, Breanna; Hensley, Krystle; Chandler, Kristin E; Plante, Jessica A; Plante, Kenneth S; Weaver, Scott C; Roy, Chad J; Hoxie, James A; Gao, Hongmei; Montefiori, David C; Mankowski, Joseph L; Bohm, Rudolf P; Rappaport, Jay; Maness, Nicholas J",,371,24

A thorough analysis of the causes revealed structural deficits in the identification and registration of possible donors as one of the central reasons for the low donation rate. This prompted the political authorities to act and resulted in two new laws, which led to a modification of the German Transplantation Act. On 1 April 2019, the Act on Improvement of the Cooperation and the Structural Framework for Organ Donation came into force. This Act strengthens the role of the transplant coordinators in the harvesting hospitals and establishes adequate reimbursement of the organ donation-related costs in the harvesting hospitals. Furthermore, it fosters the cooperation of the transplant coordinators with the German organ procurement organization. On 16 January 2020, the existing opt-in legislation was modified. While the general principle of the opt-in legislation stayed unchanged, different measures were introduced that aim to repeatedly inform all citizens about organ donation and thereby motivate them to make a decision on organ donation. In order to enable a reliable and transparent documentation an organ donor registry will be established. The practical implementation of the various measures of both Acts is supported by a multi-institutional collaborative initiative plan for organ donation.

Here we report a series of cryo-EM reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15. The UTP-bound cryo-EM reconstruction at 3.36 Å resolution provides molecular details into how critical residues within the Nsp15 active site recognize uridine and facilitate catalysis of the phosphodiester bond, whereas the apo-states reveal active site conformational heterogeneity. We further demonstrate the specificity and mechanism of nuclease activity by analyzing Nsp15 products using mass spectrometry.

SMCs resident in the walls of airways or blood vessels are continuously exposed to dynamic mechanical forces due to breathing or pulsatile blood flow. However, the resulting effects of these forces on integrin dynamics and associated cell-matrix adhesion are not well understood. Here we present experimental results from atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments, designed to study the integrin response to external oscillatory loading of varying amplitudes applied to live aortic SMCs, together with theoretical results from a mathematical model. In the AFM experiments, a fibronectin-coated probe was used cyclically to indent and retract from the surface of the cell. We observed a transition between states of firm adhesion and of complete detachment as the amplitude of oscillatory loading increased, revealed by qualitative changes in the force timecourses. Interestingly, for some of the SMCs in the experiments, switching behaviour between the two adhesion states is observed during single timecourses at intermediate amplitudes. We obtain two qualitatively similar adhesion states in the mathematical model, where we simulate the cell, integrins and ECM as an evolving system of springs, incorporating local integrin binding dynamics. In the mathematical model, we observe a region of bistability where both the firm adhesion and detachment states can occur depending on the initial adhesion state. The differences are seen to be a result of mechanical cooperativity of integrins and cell deformation. Switching behaviour is a phenomenon associated with bistability in a stochastic system, and bistability in our deterministic mathematical model provides a potential physical explanation for the experimental results. Physiologically, bistability provides a means for transient mechanical stimuli to induce long-term changes in adhesion dynamics-and thereby the cells' ability to transmit force-and we propose further experiments for testing this hypothesis.","Irons, Linda; Huang, Huang; Owen, Markus R; O039,; Dea, Reuben D; Meininger, Gerald A; Brook, Bindi S",J Theor Biol,371,16

To contribute somewhat to the overall effort, herein, single point mutations (SPMs) of the binding site residues in hCoV-OC43 S that recognizes cellular surface components containing 9-O-acetylated sialic acid (9-O-Ac-Sia) are explored using an in silico protein engineering approach, while their effects on the binding of 9-O-Ac-Sia and Hidroxychloroquine (Hcq) are evaluated using molecular docking simulations. Thr31Met and Val84Arg are predicted to be the critical - most likely SPMs in hCoV-OC43 S for the binding of 9-O-Ac-Sia and Hcq, respectively, even though Thr31Met is a very likely SPM in the case of Hcq too. The corresponding modes of interaction indicate a comparable strength of the Thr31Met/9-O-Ac-Sia and Val84Arg/Hcq (or Thr31Met/Hcq) complexes. Given that the binding site is conserved in all CoV S glycoproteins that associate with 9-O-acetyl-sialoglycans, the high hydrophobic affinity of Hcq to hCoV-OC43 S speaks in favor of its ability to competitively inhibit rapid S-mediated virion attachment in high-density receptor environments, but its considerably low specificity to hCoV-OC43 S may be one of the key obstacles in considering the potential of Hcq to become a drug candidate.","Mitrasinovic, Petar M",Acta Chim Slov,371,16

In this study, the clinical and dosimetric benefits of ART were compared with the conventional IMRT. Materials and Methods: Sixty patients with locally advanced HNC were randomized into two arms to receive IMRT up to a curative dose of 70 Gy with concurrent weekly chemotherapy and were prospectively analyzed between March 2018 and March 2019. Repeat CT scan was acquired after the 3rd week of radiation. Patients in the study arm underwent replanning, whereas those in the control arm continued with the first IMRT plan. Assessment was done weekly till the end of treatment and at 1, 3, and 6 months post IMRT for disease response and toxicities. Tumor volume reduction rate (TVRR) and dose reduction to organs at risk were also recorded. Results: Complete response was observed in 90% and 96.7% patients in the control and study arms, respectively, at the end of 6 months. Insignificant differences were found between the two arms in terms of toxicities. Xerostomia was statistically significantly higher in the control arm at 6 months (P = 0.01). TVRR was found to be 31.85%. Dose to spinal cord, ipsilateral, and contralateral parotid reduced by 4.3%, 6%, and 2.2%, respectively, with ART. Conclusion: Mid-treatment adaptive replanning can help in better target coverage and minimize toxicities in HNC patients.","Maheshwari, Guncha; Dhanawat, Aditya; Kumar, Harvindra S; Sharma, Neeti; Jakhar, Shankar Lal",J Cancer Res Ther,371,16

Consequently, they have evolved varied mechanisms to co-opt host translation for their survival. SARS-CoV-2 relies on a non-structural protein, Nsp1, for shutting down host translation. However, it is currently unknown how viral proteins and host factors critical for viral replication can escape a global shutdown of host translation. Here, using a novel FACS-based assay called MeTAFlow, we report a dose-dependent reduction in both nascent protein synthesis and mRNA abundance in cells expressing Nsp1. We perform RNA-Seq and matched ribosome profiling experiments to identify gene-specific changes both at the mRNA expression and translation level. We discover a functionally-coherent subset of human genes are preferentially translated in the context of Nsp1 expression. These genes include the translation machinery components, RNA binding proteins, and others important for viral pathogenicity. Importantly, we uncovered a remarkable enrichment of 5' terminal oligo-pyrimidine (TOP) tracts among preferentially translated genes. Using reporter assays, we validated that 5' UTRs from TOP transcripts can drive preferential expression in the presence of NSP1. Finally, we found that LARP1, a key effector protein in the mTOR pathway may contribute to preferential translation of TOP transcripts in response to Nsp1 expression. Collectively, our study suggests fine tuning of host gene expression and translation by Nsp1 despite its global repressive effect on host protein synthesis.","Rao, Shilpa; Hoskins, Ian; Tonn, Tori; Garcia, Daniela; Ozadam, Hakan; Sarinay Cenik, Elif; Cenik, Can",RNA,371,30

The incidence and mortality of COVID-19 patients have been increasing at an alarming rate. The mortality is much higher in older individuals, especially the ones suffering from respiratory distress, cardiac abnormalities, renal diseases, diabetes, and hypertension. Existing evidence demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 makes its entry into human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) followed by the uptake of virions through cathepsin L or transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). SARS-CoV-2-mediated abnormalities in particular cardiovascular and neurological ones and the damaged coagulation systems require extensive research to develop better therapeutic modalities. As SARS-CoV-2 uses its S-protein to enter into the host cells of several organs, the S-protein of the virus is considered as the ideal target to develop a potential vaccine. In this review, we have attempted to highlight the landmark discoveries that lead to the development of various vaccines that are currently under different stages of clinical progression. Besides, a brief account of various drug candidates that are being tested to mitigate the burden of COVID-19 was also covered. Further, in a dedicated section, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on neuronal inflammation and neuronal disorders was discussed.

The city was founded by 19th- and 20th-century colonists from Chile (Chiloé) and Europe (Croatia). This work uses uniparental and ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) to explore the effects of historic migratory and admixture patterns on the current genetic composition of Punta Arenas. METHODS: We analyzed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), Y-chromosome single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and 141 AIMs obtained from 129 DNA samples from male residents with regional ancestry. After characterizing uniparental lineages and ancestry proportions, multivariate analysis was used to explore relationships among the various types of data. RESULTS: Punta Arenas has an admixed population with three main genetic components: European (56.5%), northern Native (11.3%), and south-central Native (28.6%). The Native component is preponderant in the mtDNA (83.76%), while the foreign component predominates in the Y-chromosome (92.25%). Non-Native mtDNA lineages are associated with European genetic ancestry, and Native mtDNA lineages originated mainly in the southern and southernmost regions of Chile. Most non-Native Y-chromosome SNPs originated in Spain, and secondly, in Croatia. CONCLUSIONS: The population of Punta Arenas is mainly of Chilote origin with south-central Native and Spanish ancestral components, as well as some Croatian components. The persistence of local Native lineages is notable, suggesting continuity with the ancestral populations of the region such as the Kawésqar, Aönikenk, Yámana, or Selknam peoples.

The aim of our work is to expose the activity of kidney transplantation in Cantabria during the state of alarm, as well as to assess the safety of the transplantation program. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of kidney transplants performed in our Center from the beginning of the state of alarm until the beginning of the lockdown easing in Cantabria. Descriptive analysis of the demographic data of recipients and their donors, intraoperative data and postoperative outcomes. Comparative analysis with the data of the same period in 2017-2019, by means of the &#967;2 for categorical variables, Student's T and Mann-Whitney U tests in case of quantitative variables of normal and non-normal distribution, respectively. RESULTS: Fifteen kidney transplants were performed in the period described. Delayed renal function (DRF) was seen in 7.5% of patients, and 26.6% showed data of acute rejection; no patient presented COVID-19 disease. Comparative analysis showed a remarkable increase in the number of transplants in comparison with previous periods (15 vs 5.6), at the expense of donors from outside Cantabria (93.3%). We found no statistically significant differences in terms of cold ischemia time (p=0.77), DRF (p=0.73), need for dialysis (p=0.54), or appearance of post-surgical complications (p=0.61).

Further, it remains unclear whether neurological manifestations are primarily due to neurotropism of the virus, or indirect effects, like cerebral hypoxia. METHODS: We analysed the electroencephalograms (EEGs) of 19 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, performed at peak disease severity as part of their clinical management. Disease severity, respiratory failure, immune and metabolic dysfunction, sedation status, and neurological examination on the day of the EEG were noted. RESULTS: Severe encephalopathy was confirmed in 13 patients, all with severe COVID-19; 10 remained comatose off sedation, and five of them had alpha coma (AC). Disease severity, sedation, immune and metabolic dysfunction were not different between those with AC and those without. CONCLUSIONS: Severe COVID-19 encephalopathy is a principal cause of persisting coma after sedation withdrawal. The relatively high incidence of the rare AC pattern may reflect direct SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism with a predilection for the brainstem ascending reticular system. SIGNIFICANCE: Systematic early EEG detection of encephalopathy related to severe COVID-19 is important for the acute care and the management of long-term neurological and cognitive sequelae, and may help our better understanding of its pathophysiology.","Koutroumanidis, Michail; Gratwicke, James; Sharma, Simeran; Whelan, Aoife; Tan, S Veronica; Glover, Guy",Clin. neurophysiol,371,16

Although an increasing number of biomedical QA datasets has been recently made available, those resources are still rather limited and expensive to produce. Transfer learning via pre-trained language models (LMs) has been shown as a promising approach to leverage existing general-purpose knowledge. However, fine-tuning these large models can be costly and time consuming, often yielding limited benefits when adapting to specific themes of specialised domains, such as the COVID-19 literature. To bootstrap further their domain adaptation, we propose a simple yet unexplored approach, which we call biomedical entity-aware masking (BEM). We encourage masked language models to learn entity-centric knowledge based on the pivotal entities characterizing the domain at hand, and employ those entities to drive the LM fine-tuning. The resulting strategy is a downstream process applicable to a wide variety of masked LMs, not requiring additional memory or components in the neural architectures. Experimental results show performance on par with state-of-the-art models on several biomedical QA datasets. © 2021 Association for Computational Linguistics","Pergola, G.; Kochkina, E.; Gui, L.; Liakata, M.; He, Y.","16th Conference of the European Chapter of the Associationfor Computational Linguistics, EACL 2021",371,20

With the ongoing media coverage and spread of misinformation, public health authorities need to identify effective strategies and create culturally appropriate and evidence-based messaging that best encourage preventive health behaviors to control the spread of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between COVID-19 sources of information and knowledge, and how US adults' knowledge may be associated with preventive health behaviors to help mitigate COVID-19 cases and deaths. DESIGN AND SETTING: For this cross-sectional study, survey data pertaining to COVID-19 were collected via online platform, Qualtrics, in February and May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Data responses included 718 US adults from the February survey and 672 US adults from the May survey-both representative of the US adult population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 knowledge score, COVID-19 reliable sources of information, and adherence to COVID-19 preventive health behaviors. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The main findings showed that disseminating COVID-19 information across various sources, particularly television, health care providers, and health officials, to increase people's COVID-19 knowledge contributes to greater adherence to infection prevention behaviors. Across February and May 2020 survey data, participants 55 years and older and those with higher educational background reported a higher average COVID-19 knowledge score. In addition, among the racial and ethnic categories, Black/African American and Native American/Alaska Native participants reported a lower average COVID-19 knowledge score than white participants-signaling the need to establish COVID-19 communication that is culturally-tailored and community-based. Overall, health care authorities must deliver clear and concise messaging about the importance of adhering to preventive health behaviors, even as COVID-19 vaccines become widely available to the general public. Health officials must also focus on increasing COVID-19 knowledge and dispelling misinformation.","Shafiq, Mehr; Elharake, Jad A; Malik, Amyn A; McFadden, SarahAnn M; Aguolu, Obianuju Genevieve; Omer, Saad B",J Public Health Manag Pract,371,24
395534,395534,395534,Therapeutic Development and Drugs for the Treatment of COVID-19,16.718105,9.31972,2020,"Objectives: In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, visits by relatives to Nursing Homes for the Elderly (EHPAD) and Long-Term Care Units (USLD) have been severely restricted or even prohibited in order to protect the residents and patients, especially the most vulnerable among them. This situation has revived the debate around the place and role of the relational entourage in caring for the elderly. The relevance of family ties in supporting the narcissistic and objectal cathexis of the elderly has thus gained recognition. There is, however, the risk of an emerging form of uniformization and idealization, which the present article seeks to address by highlighting some aspects of the intrapsychic and inter-relational dynamics that drive the inherent complexity of those bonds. Method: The authors seek to identify the psychic processes involved in varying forms of presence and of motivation of ""natural caregivers"" and ""professional caregivers."" Their approach is based on a psychodynamic analysis of the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic and the changes induced in the links between the patient or elderly resident and his or her entourage. Complex movements fueling the dynamics involved in these links are revealed. A clinical vignette based on research in clinical psychology and psychopathology is provided. Results: The pandemic context showed the creative strategies devised by relatives and carers to maintain forms of presence and links ""at a distance"" with isolated and confined elderly people. However, the various configurations of these arrangements also highlighted the tensions, sometimes tinged with rivalry, in the negotiations that inform the respective places and roles of family members and professionals around the subjects concerned. The caregiver's position is not self-evident and presupposes an involvement that cannot be construed on a merely functional and behavioral level. Rather, it requires a need for psychic work drawing on the identificatory and projective movements inevitably mobilized in closeness with the subject, without alienating oneself. Ambivalence, empathy, and support can then be deployed, where excessive control, covert hostility, and over-excitement are constant threats to such a necessarily close relationship. This disposition in the caregiver also encounters a singular psychic disposition on the part of the person being helped, informed by a lively conflictuality. This sometimes takes on surprising undertones, as in the case of Georges, an 86-year-old patient, where the caregiver as a ""close-human-being"" was fully recognized only on the condition that the relationship of help and care supported, sustained, and nourished unconscious masochistic needs. Discussion: These perspectives are an invitation to ponder the plurality of figures of the ""close-human-being"" and to find one's place in a psychic and relational economy where the self-preserving and psychosexual registers are in constant interplay. They also underline the need to focus on working, individually and collectively, on the quality of the entourage's presence. This is all mediated by a complex organizational pattern anchored in the potential for reciprocal support between the family group, the caregiving group, and the institutional setting. Conclusion: These various propositions help clarifythe components of the psychic conflictuality implied, on the one hand, in the horizontal tensions existing between the various members of the familial and professional circle and, on the other hand, in the vertical tensions inherent in intergenerational dynamics. The elderly are far from being passive objects in this and their contribution is essential. The concern to ensure the close involvement of the elderly person's relatives and foster the quality of the ensuing exchanges is laudable, indeed vital. This should not, however, lead us to downplay the crucial and singular place the elderly subjects themselves occupy in individual, family, and societal dynamics, as full citizens, members of their relatives' entourage, and essential figures in the establishment of the great psychic organizing functions that structure the difference in generations and the psychic processes of identification.","Verdon, Benoît; Racin, Céline",Evol. psychiatr(Paris),371,26

However, iNATs can often generate spurious amplicons, especially in the absence of target sequences, resulting in false-positive results. This is especially true if signals are based on non-sequence-specific probes, such as intercalating dyes or pH changes. In addition, pathogens often prove to be moving, evolving targets and can accumulate mutations that will lead to inefficient primer binding and thus false-negative results. Multiplex assays targeting different regions of the analyte and logical signal readout using sequence-specific probes can help to reduce both false negatives and false positives. Here, we describe rapid conversion of three previously described SARS-CoV-2 LAMP assays that relied on a non-sequence-specific readout into individual and multiplex one-pot assays that can be visually read using sequence-specific oligonucleotide strand exchange (OSD) probes. We describe both fluorescence-based and Boolean logic-gated colorimetric lateral flow readout methods and demonstrate detection of SARS-CoV-2 virions in crude human saliva.IMPORTANCE One of the key approaches to treatment and control of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, is accurate and rapid diagnostics that is widely deployable in a timely and scalable manner. To achieve this, it is essential to go beyond the traditional gold standard of quantitative PCR (qPCR) that is often faced with difficulties in scaling due to the complexity of infrastructure and human resource requirements. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), have been long pursued as ideal, low-tech alternatives for rapid, portable testing. However, isothermal approaches often suffer from false signals due to employment of nonspecific readout methods. We describe general principles for rapidly converting nonspecifically read LAMP assays into assays that are read in a sequence-specific manner by using oligonucleotide strand displacement (OSD) probes. We also demonstrate that inclusion of OSD probes in LAMP assays maintains the simplicity of one-pot assays and a visual yes/no readout by using fluorescence or colorimetric lateral-flow dipsticks while providing accurate sequence-specific readout and the ability to logically query multiplex amplicons for redundancy or copresence. These principles not only yielded high-surety isothermal assays for SARS-CoV-2 but might also aid in the design of more sophisticated molecular assays for other analytes.","Bhadra, Sanchita; Riedel, Timothy E; Lakhotia, Simren; Tran, Nicholas D; Ellington, Andrew D",MSphere,371,29

As the virus spreads through close contacts, particularly in closed environments, public transport vehicles could be considered as hotspots for its transmission. However, public transport operations cannot be entirely stopped as many people in developing countries rely on them for their travel needs. This study aims to provide insights into people's travel mode choices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data, i.e., 1,516 complete survey responses, were obtained through a questionnaire that was conducted in Lahore, Pakistan. A binary logistic model was developed using the collected data to model the likelihood of choosing solo or public transport modes during COVID-19. The results explained that the respondents preferred solo modes more than the public transport modes during the pandemic. Gender, income, education, profession, trip frequency, car ownership, motorbike ownership, and an underlying factor that was defined as “safety precautions” were found to be significant predictors of the public transport choice relative to solo modes. Females tend to choose public transport modes relative to solo modes as compared to males. Private vehicle (car or motorbike) owners were less likely to use public modes relative to solo modes when compared to those who do not own private vehicles. The outcomes of this study could be important for the government authorities, policymakers and transport operators to understand the public transport use in developing countries during pandemics. Such information will be useful to devise regulations and preventive measures to control infectious diseases associated with public transport use, particularly in developing countries, where private transport options are limited.","Abdullah, Muhammad Ali Nazam Javid Muhammad Ashraf Dias Charitha Campisi Tiziana",Transportation Engineering,371,1

However, significant variations are observed in following the policy across individuals and countries. Arguably, differences in citizens' adherence actions will be influenced by their perceptions about government's plans and the information available to guide their behaviors-more so in the digital age in the realm of mass influence of social media on citizens. Insights into the underlying factors and dynamics involved with citizens' adherence process will inform the policy makers to follow appropriate communication and messaging approaches to influence citizens' willingness to adhere to the recommendations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is a comparative evaluation of citizens' adherence process to COVID-19-relevant recommendations by the government. The focus is on how three different countries' (United States, Kuwait, and South Korea) citizens, randomly sampled, respond to governments' pandemic guidance efforts. We draw insights into two categories of perceived government roles in managing the pandemic: (1) citizens' perceptions of government's role in responding to the pandemic and (2) citizens' perceptions of government's business reopening efforts. Undoubtedly, the internet and social media have burgeoned, with differing effects on shaping individuals' views and assessments of the COVID-19 situation; we argue and test for the effects of information sources, social media use, and knowledge on the adherence actions. METHODS: We randomly sampled web-based survey data collected by a global firm in May 2020 from citizens of the United States, Kuwait, and South Korea. A nonlinear ordered probit regression, controlling for several counterfactuals, was used for analysis. The focal estimated effects of the study were compared across countries using the weighted distance between the parameter estimates. RESULTS: The total sample size was 482 respondents, of which 207 (43%) lived in the United States, 181 (38%) lived in Kuwait, and 94 (20%) lived in South Korea. The ordered probit estimation results suggest that overall, perception of government response efforts positively influenced self-adherence (P<.001) and others' adherence (P<.001) to social distancing and sheltering. Perception of government business reopening efforts positively influenced others' adherence (P<.001). A higher intensity of general health information source for COVID-19 had a positive effect on self-adherence (P=.003). A higher intensity of social media source use for COVID-19 positively influenced others' adherence (P=.002). A higher intensity of knowledge on COVID-19 positively influenced self-adherence (P=.008) and negatively influenced others' adherence (P<.001). There were country-level variations-broadly, the United States and Kuwait had better effects than South Korea. CONCLUSIONS: As the COVID-19 global pandemic continues to grow and governmental restrictions are ongoing, it is critical to understand people's frustration to reduce panic and promote social distancing to facilitate the control of the pandemic.

METHODS: We reviewed the COVID-19 vaccination guidance for pregnant and breastfeeding women published to date and evidence from preclinical experimental and observational clinical studies, and discuss their implications. RESULTS: Pregnant women were excluded from the initial phase 3 clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines resulting in limited data on their efficacy and safety during pregnancy and postpartum. As a result, since December 2020, there has been conflicting advice from public health, governmental, and professional authorities on this matter. From the end of 2020 up to now, some consensus guidance has been published with a prevalent precautionary approach on the administration of vaccines in pregnant women, in breastfeeding ones, or for those who are planning a pregnancy (either spontaneously or with assisted technologies). After the first few months of vaccine administration in some countries, more permissiveness seems to prevail, although with inconsistencies. At the moment, the results obtained by preclinical experimental and observational clinical studies suggest that the risks of the maternal COVID-19 outweigh the undocumented and hypothetical risks of the COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy. Also, until two viral vector COVID-19 vaccines were associated with very rare thromboembolic events, all guidance had agreed that all approved COVID-19 vaccines could be administered in pregnancy. Actually, some concern has been expressed. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 vaccines administered in pregnancy can reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 and their serious consequences for mothers and their offspring. However, many aspects remain to be clarified.","Brillo, Eleonora; Tosto, Valentina; Gerli, Sandro; Buonomo, Ersilia",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,371,30

Differentiation between pure viral COVID-19 pneumonia and secondary infection can be challenging. In patients with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) on admission physicians often decide to prescribe antibiotic therapy. However, overuse of anti-infective therapy in the pandemic should be avoided to prevent increasing antimicrobial resistance. Procalcitonin (PCT) and CRP have proven useful in other lower respiratory tract infections and might help to differentiate between pure viral or secondary infection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients admitted with COVID-19 between 6th March and 30th October 2020. Patient background, clinical course, laboratory findings with focus on PCT and CRP levels and microbiology results were evaluated. Patients with and without secondary bacterial infection in relation to PCT and CRP were compared. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the best discriminating cut-off value of PCT and CRP with the corresponding sensitivity and specificity was calculated. RESULTS: Out of 99 inpatients (52 ICU, 47 Non-ICU) with COVID-19, 32 (32%) presented with secondary bacterial infection during hospitalization. Patients with secondary bacterial infection had higher PCT (0.4 versus 0.1 ng/mL; p = 0.016) and CRP (131 versus 73 mg/L; p = 0.001) levels at admission and during the hospital stay (2.9 versus 0.1 ng/mL; p < 0.001 resp. 293 versus 94 mg/L; p < 0.001). The majority of patients on general ward had no secondary bacterial infection (93%). More than half of patients admitted to the ICU developed secondary bacterial infection (56%). ROC analysis of highest PCT resp. CRP and secondary infection yielded AUCs of 0.88 (p < 0.001) resp. 0.86 (p < 0.001) for the entire cohort. With a PCT cut-off value at 0.55 ng/mL, the sensitivity was 91% with a specificity of 81%; a CRP cut-off value at 172 mg/L yielded a sensitivity of 81% with a specificity of 76%. CONCLUSION: PCT and CRP measurement on admission and during the course of the disease in patients with COVID-19 may be helpful in identifying secondary bacterial infections and guiding the use of antibiotic therapy.","Pink, Isabell; Raupach, David; Fuge, Jan; Vonberg, Ralf-Peter; Hoeper, Marius M; Welte, Tobias; Rademacher, Jessica",Infection,371,16

Small animal models that reproduce key elements of SARS-CoV-2 human infections are needed to rigorously screen candidate drugs to mitigate severe disease and prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We and others have reported that transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) viral receptor under the control of the Keratin 18 (K18) promoter develop severe and lethal respiratory disease subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 intranasal challenge. Here we report that some infected mice that survive challenge have residual pulmonary damages and persistent brain infection on day 28 post-infection despite the presence of anti-SARS-COV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Because of the hypersensitivity of K18-hACE2 mice to SARS-CoV-2 and the propensity of virus to infect the brain, we sought to determine if anti-infective biologics could protect against disease in this model system. We demonstrate that anti-SARS-CoV-2 human convalescent plasma protects K18-hACE2 against severe disease. All control mice succumbed to disease by day 7; however, all treated mice survived infection without observable signs of disease. In marked contrast to control mice, viral antigen and lesions were reduced or absent from lungs and absent in brains of antibody-treated mice. Our findings support the use of K18-hACE2 mice for protective efficacy studies of anti-SARS-CoV-2 medical countermeasures (MCMs). They also support the use of this system to study SARS-CoV-2 persistence and host recovery.","Golden, Joseph W; Zeng, Xiankun; Cline, Curtis R; Garrison, Aura R; White, Lauren E; Fitzpatrick, Collin J; Kwilas, Steven A; Bowling, Philip A; Fiallos, Jimmy O; Moore, Joshua L; Sifford, Willie B; Ricks, Keersten M; Mucker, Eric M; Smith, Jeffrey M; Hooper, Jay W",J. gen. virol,371,31

Health care workers (HCWs) on frontline directly participated in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of COVID-19 patients are at high risk of getting infected with the highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. In Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, a total of 222 medical staff went to Wuhan city for support. In this study, we aimed to determine any nosocomial infection among our cohort of HCWs who worked in Wuhan. METHODS: Throat swab samples were obtained for RNA testing on day 1 and 14 of their quarantine upon their return to Nanjing. Radiological assessments were performed by chest computed tomography (CT) on day 14 of their quarantine. The blood was collected from 191 HCWs between May 12 and May 15. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibody responses were determined by a chemiluminescence immunoassay. RESULTS: All the throat swab specimens were found negative for SARS-CoV-2. The radiological analysis revealed that there was no typical chest CT scan of COVID-19 among 222 HCWs. Consistently, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG was also found to be negative among 191 HCWs. CONCLUSIONS: There was no nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 among our cohort of the frontline HCWs, suggesting that zero occupational infection is an achievable goal with appropriate training, strict compliance, and psychological support for the frontline HCWs.","Tong, Xin; Ning, Mingzhe; Huang, Rui; Jia, Bei; Yan, Xiaomin; Xiong, Yali; Wu, Weihua; Liu, Jiacheng; Chen, Yuxin; Wu, Chao",Immun Inflamm Dis,371,24

In Taiwan, most cases to date were imported or linked to imported cases. METHODS: In collaboration with Facebook Data for Good, we characterized changes in movement patterns in Taiwan since February 2020, and built metapopulation models that incorporate human movement data to identify the high risk areas of disease spread and assess the potential effects of local travel restrictions in Taiwan. RESULTS: We found that mobility changed with the number of local cases in Taiwan in the past few months. For each city, we identified the most highly connected areas that may serve as sources of importation during an outbreak. We showed that the risk of an outbreak in Taiwan is enhanced if initial infections occur around holidays. Intracity travel reductions have a higher impact on the risk of an outbreak than intercity travel reductions, while intercity travel reductions can narrow the scope of the outbreak and help target resources. The timing, duration, and level of travel reduction together determine the impact of travel reductions on the number of infections, and multiple combinations of these can result in similar impact. CONCLUSIONS: To prepare for the potential spread within Taiwan, we utilized Facebook's aggregated and anonymized movement and colocation data to identify cities with higher risk of infection and regional importation. We developed an interactive application that allows users to vary inputs and assumptions and shows the spatial spread of the disease and the impact of intercity and intracity travel reduction under different initial conditions. Our results can be used readily if local transmission occurs in Taiwan after relaxation of border control, providing important insights into future disease surveillance and policies for travel restrictions.","Chang, Meng-Chun; Kahn, Rebecca; Li, Yu-An; Lee, Cheng-Sheng; Buckee, Caroline O; Chang, Hsiao-Han",BMC Public Health,371,14

This model is calibrated to reproduce several characteristics of COVID-19 transmission, accounting for its reproductive number, the length of incubation and generation periods, age-dependent attack rates, and the growth rate of cumulative incidence during a sustained and unmitigated local transmission. An important calibration outcome is the age-dependent fraction of symptomatic cases, with this fraction for children found to be one-fifth of such fraction for adults. We then apply the model to compare several intervention strategies, including restrictions on international air travel, case isolation, social distancing with varying levels of compliance, and school closures. School closures are not found to bring decisive benefits. We report an important transition across the levels of social distancing compliance, in the range between 70% and 80% levels. This suggests that a compliance of below 70% is unlikely to succeed for any duration of social distancing, while a compliance at the 90% level is likely to control the disease within 13-14 weeks, when coupled with effective case isolation and international travel restrictions.","Chang, Sheryl L.; Harding, Nathan; Zachreson, Cameron; Cliff, Oliver M.; Prokopenko, Mikhail",,371,33

Norepinephrine infusion is increasingly used for prevention of post-SA hypotension; however, its effects as compared to the traditional phenylephrine infusion remain unclear. This study aimed to compare the effects of phenylephrine and norepinephrine administered as continuous infusion during elective CD on maternal hemodynamic parameters and maternal and fetal outcomes. METHODS: This prospective, single-center, randomized, controlled study included 238 consecutive term parturients who underwent CD from February 2019 to October 2019. They were randomized to receive continuous infusion of 0.25 µg/kg/min phenylephrine, 0.05 µg/kg/min norepinephrine, or placebo. Hemodynamic monitoring was performed at 10 time points using LiDCOrapid. We analyzed umbilical vein (UV), umbilical artery (UA), and peripheral vein (PV) blood gas indexes and recorded intraoperative complications. RESULTS: In phenylephrine group, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) remain during the whole operation. Compared to the control group, phenylephrine, but not norepinephrine, significantly increased the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) to counteract the SA-induced vasodilatation, 3 min following norepinephrine/phenylephrine/LR administration (T4): 957.4 ± 590.3 vs 590.1 ± 273.7 (P < 0.000001); 5 min following norepinephrine/phenylephrine/LR administration (T5): 1104 ± 468.0 vs 789.4 ± 376.2 (P = 0.000002). at the time of incision (T6): 1084 ± 524.8 vs 825.2 ± 428.6 (P = 0.000188). Parturients in the phenylephrine group had significantly lower UV (1.91 ± 0.43) (P = 0.0003) and UA (2.05 ± 0.61) (P = 0.0038) lactate level compared to controls. Moreover, the UV pH value was higher in the phenylephrine than in the control group7.37 ± 0.03(P = 0.0013). Parturients had lower incidence of nausea, tachycardia, hypotension in phenylephrine group. CONCLUSIONS: In this dataset, continuous phenylephrine infusion reduced the incidence of SA-induced hypotension, ameliorated SVR, while decreasing overall maternal complications. Phenylephrine infusions are considered the better choice during CD because of the significant benefit to the fetus.

No entanto, iniciativas de moedas complementares existem há muitos anos no Brasil, estando associadas especialmente aos bancos comunitários, os quais operam no nível local e possuem conhecimento mais aprofundado sobre as necessidades dos moradores. Este artigo analisa o uso de moedas digitais complementares no enfrentamento de desafios de distribuição de renda. Apresentamos o caso da moeda complementar digital Mumbuca E-Dinheiro, adotada pelo município de Maricá (RJ). Discutimos como esta iniciativa permitiu a distribuição de renda de forma rápida e segura com o objetivo de mitigar os efeitos da pandemia da COVID-19 no Brasil. Sugerimos que, no momento atual, a RBE poderia ser paga através do E-dinheiro, começando pelos municípios nos quais ele já atua e depois se expandindo para os demais.

Although diagnostic tests are fundamental to the ability to detect and respond, overwhelmed healthcare systems are already experiencing shortages of reagents associated with this test, calling for a lean immediately applicable protocol. METHODS: RNA extracts of positive samples were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, alone or in pools of different sizes (2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-sample pools) with negative samples. Transport media of additional 3 positive samples were also tested when mixed with transport media of negative samples in pools of 8. RESULTS: A single positive sample can be detected in pools of up to 32 samples, using the standard kits and protocols, with an estimated false negative rate of 10%. Detection of positive samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may also be attainable, although this may require additional amplification cycles. Single positive samples can be detected when pooling either after or prior to RNA extraction. CONCLUSIONS: As it uses the standard protocols, reagents, and equipment, this pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories. We hope that such implementation of a pool test for coronavirus disease 2019 would allow expanding current screening capacities, thereby enabling the expansion of detection in the community, as well as in close organic groups, such as hospital departments, army units, or factory shifts.","Yelin, Idan; Aharony, Noga; Tamar, Einat Shaer; Argoetti, Amir; Messer, Esther; Berenbaum, Dina; Shafran, Einat; Kuzli, Areen; Gandali, Nagham; Shkedi, Omer; Hashimshony, Tamar; Mandel-Gutfreund, Yael; Halberthal, Michael; Geffen, Yuval; Szwarcwort-Cohen, Moran; Kishony, Roy",Clin Infect Dis,371,16

Nonetheless, the most likely cause of the broad spread of COVID-19 among members of the Shincheonji religious group remains largely unknown. METHODS: We obtained data of laboratory-confirmed cases related to the Shincheonji religious group from press releases by Korean public health authorities and news reports. We measured the period from the date of illness onset to the date of COVID-19 confirmation. RESULTS: We analysed data from 59 cases (median age, 30 years). The estimated median period between the date of symptom onset and the date of COVID-19 confirmation was 4 days (95% confidence interval, 1-12). CONCLUSIONS: There was a delay in COVID-19 confirmation from the date of illness onset among the cases linked to the Shincheonji religious group. This delay likely contributed to the occurrence of many cases of COVID-19 in the group.","Kim, Hyung-Ju; Hwang, Hyun-Seong; Choi, Yong-Hyuk; Song, Hye-Yeon; Park, Ji-Seong; Yun, Chae-Young; Ryu, Sukhyun",J Prev Med Public Health,371,0

Here we combine single-molecule spectroscopy with all-atom simulations to uncover the molecular details that contribute to N protein function. N protein contains three dynamic disordered regions that house putative transiently-helical binding motifs. The two folded domains interact minimally such that full-length N protein is a flexible and multivalent RNA-binding protein. N protein also undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation when mixed with RNA, and polymer theory predicts that the same multivalent interactions that drive phase separation also engender RNA compaction. We offer a simple symmetry-breaking model that provides a plausible route through which single-genome condensation preferentially occurs over phase separation, suggesting that phase separation offers a convenient macroscopic readout of a key nanoscopic interaction.","Cubuk, Jasmine; Alston, Jhullian J; Incicco, J Jeremías; Singh, Sukrit; Stuchell-Brereton, Melissa D; Ward, Michael D; Zimmerman, Maxwell I; Vithani, Neha; Griffith, Daniel; Wagoner, Jason A; Bowman, Gregory R; Hall, Kathleen B; Soranno, Andrea; Holehouse, Alex S",Nat Commun,371,16

Herein, rationale development of amorphous solid dispersion with hot-melt extrusion of poorly bioavailable OLM was carried out with the aid of quality by design (QbD), in-silico, in-vitro, and in-vivo evaluations. Polymer selection commenced with the selection of thermoplastic water-soluble polymers with the compatible processing temperature window as per the thermal behavior of OLM. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as well assisted in the selection of a carrier. Promising dissolution enhancement was observed with the help of Kollidon VA-64 (VA-64) as a carrier. Optimization of the formulation was executed using the QbD approach with design of experiment as a statistical optimization tool. Interactions between VA-64 and OLM on the atomic level were studied with the help of atomistic MD simulations. Characterization of the optimized extrudates were carried out with scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, in-vitro dissolution study, and in-vivo pharmacokinetic studies. Molecular-level mixing of OLM with VA-64 resulted into glass solution formation which rapidly dissolves (28 times in-vitro dissolution enhancement) in GI tract fluids and instantly gets absorbed into blood circulation. In-vivo pharmacokinetic studies performed in Sprague-Dawley rats reflected superior bioavailability (201.60%) with a significant increase in the Cmax with short Tmax through amorphization of OLM. The in-silico results were in agreement with the observed results of in-vitro dissolution studies and in-vivo pharmacokinetic study.","Jadhav, Pankaj; Gokarna, Vinod; Deshpande, Vineeta; Vavia, Pradeep",AAPS PharmSciTech,371,21

METHODS: Design: Multicentre observational case-control study. PATIENTS: RID and COVID-19 from different centres in Andalusia. CONTROLS: patients without RIS matched by sex, age and CRP-COVID. Protocol A list of patients with PCR for COVID-19 was requested from the microbiology service from March 14 to April 14, 2020. The patients who had RID were identified and then consecutively a paired control for each case. Variables The main outcome variable was hospital admission and mortality from COVID-19. Statistical analysis Bivariate followed by binary logistic regression models (DV: mortality/hospital admission). RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-six patients were included, 78 with RID and COVID-19 and 78 without RID with COVID-19. The patients did not present characteristics of COVID-19 disease different from the general population, nor did they present higher hospital admission or mortality. The factor associated with mortality in patients with RID was advanced age (OR [95% CI], 1.1 [1.0-1.2]; p = 0.025), while the factors associated with hospitalization were advanced age (OR [95% CI], 1.1 [1.0-1.1]; p = 0.007) and hypertension (OR [95% CI], 3.9 [1.5-6.7]; p = 0.003).

AIMS: In the framework of a telemedicine program, we aimed to validate and implement a telephone-administered version of the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (TELE-MPI) among community-dwelling older outpatients. METHOD: From March 9 to May 11, 2020, 131 older patients (82.1 years; 74% females) were interviewed using a telephone-based survey to calculate the TELE-MPI. The standard MPI was performed face-to-face three months apart. The Bland-Altman methodology measured the agreement between the two tools. Multivariate logistic regression models were built to ascertain the prognostic value of TELE-MPI and TELE-MPI classes (low, moderate, or severe risk) on negative outcomes occurring during the lockdown period. RESULTS: Mean MPI and TELE-MPI values were 0.523 and 0.522, respectively. Lower and upper 95% limits of agreement were - 0.122 and + 0.124, respectively, with only 4.6% of observations outside the limits. Each 0.1 increase of TELE-MPI score was significantly correlated with higher incidence of psychiatric disorders [odd ratio (OR): 1.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27, 1.95] and falls (OR: 1.41; 95% CI 1.08, 1.82) in community-dwelling-older adults. DISCUSSION: TELE-MPI showed a strong agreement with the standard MPI and was able to predict psychiatric disorders and falls during lockdown period. CONCLUSION: TELE-MPI may represent a useful way to follow by remote the health status of older adults.","Custodero, Carlo; Senesi, Barbara; Pinna, Alessandra; Floris, Annarosa; Vigo, Martina; Fama, Marcella; Mastropierro, Valeria; Sabbà, Carlo; Prete, Camilla; Pilotto, Alberto",Aging clin. exp. res,371,1

Several studies point to knowledge about the virus, trust in government officials, and trust in scientists as reliable predictors of social distancing, yet the exact nature of the relations between these predictor variables remains unexplored. Examining these relations in a study involving 998 participants, we found that less trust in former President Trump's ability to guide the nation through the COVID-19 crisis and greater trust in scientists predicted greater COVID-19 knowledge. In turn, greater COVID-19 knowledge predicted greater social-distancing behavior, and did so most strongly among those who reported (1) relatively low levels of trust in Trump and (2) relatively high levels of trust in scientists. These findings add a layer of complexity to our understanding of how knowledge about an issue and trust in authority figures shape behavior, suggesting that in addition to predicting the amount of knowledge people have on a certain issue, trust may play role in influencing the perceived validity of that knowledge as a basis for behavior. The implications of this work for campaigns aimed at increasing compliance with scientific guidelines are discussed.

METHODS: Multicentre-combined (retrospective-prospective) cohort study with AC patients in the Community of Madrid between 1st March and 30th May 2020. 257 AC patients were involved in 16 public hospital. Multivariant binomial logistic regression (MBLR) was applied to mortality. RESULTS: Of COVID-19 patients, 30 were diagnosed at admission and 12 patients were diagnosed during de admission or 30 days after discharge. In non-COVID-19 patients, antibiotic therapy was received in 61.3% of grade I AC and 40.6% of grade II AC. 52.4% of grade III AC were treated with percutaneous drainage (PD). Median hospital stay was 5 [3-8] days, which was higher in the non-surgical treatment group with 7.51 days (p < 0.001) and a 3.25% of mortality rate (p < 0.21). 93.3% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at admission were treated with non-surgical treatment (p = 0.03), median hospital stay was 11.0 [7.5-27.5] days (p < 0.001) with a 7.5% of mortality rate (p > 0.05). In patients with hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, 91.7% of grade I-II AC were treated with non-surgical treatment (p = 0.037), with a median hospital stay of 16 [4-21] days and a 18.2% mortality rate (p > 0.05). Hospital-acquired infection risk when hospital stay is > 7 days is OR 4.7, CI 95% (1.3-16.6), p = 0.009. COVID-19 mortality rate was 11.9%, AC severity adjusted OR 5.64 (CI 95% 1.417-22.64). In MBLR analysis, age (OR 1.15, CI 95% 1.02-1.31), SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 14.49, CI 95% 1.33-157.81), conservative treatment failure (OR 8.2, CI 95% 1.34-50.49) and AC severity were associated with an increased odd of mortality. CONCLUSION: In our population, during COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase of non-surgical treatment which was accompanied by an increase of conservative treatment failure, morbidity and hospital stay length which may have led to an increased risk hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age, SARS-CoV-2 infection, AC severity and conservative treatment failure were mortality risk factors.","Martínez Caballero, Javier; González González, Lucía; Rodríguez Cuéllar, Elías; Ferrero Herrero, Eduardo; Pérez Algar, Cristina; Vaello Jodra, Victor; Pérez Díaz, María Dolores; Dziakova, Jana; San Román Romanillos, Rosario; Di Martino, Marcello; de la Hoz Rodríguez, Ángela; Galán Martín, Mónica; Sánchez López, Daniel; García Virosta, Mariana; de la Fuente Bartolomé, Marta; Pardo de Lama, María de Mar; Gutiérrez Samaniego, María; Díaz Pérez, David; Alias Jiménez, David; de Nicolás Navas, Luis; Pérez Alegre, Juan José; García-Quijada García, Javier; Guevara-Martínez, Jenny; Villadoniga, Arantxa; Martínez Fernández, Roberto",Eur. j. trauma emerg. surg,371,16

Interview data collected during the 2014 Ebola Virus Disease PHE of International Concern suggest that ED clinicians have a strong sense of professional responsibility, but this can be compromised by increased visibility of risk and sub-optimal engagement from hospital managers and public health authorities. The study exposes the tension between a healthcare worker's right to protection and a duty to provide treatment. Given the narrow window of opportunity to prepare for a surge of COVID-19 presentations, there is an immediate need to reflect and learn from previous experiences. To maintain the confidence of ED clinicians, and minimise the risk of moral injury, hospital and public health authorities must urgently develop processes to support ethical healthcare delivery and ensure adequate resourcing of EDs.","Markwell, Alexandra; Mitchell, Rob; Wright, April L; Brown, Anthony Ft",Emerg Med Australas,371,5

METHODS: Totally 75 COVID-19 patients admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine from January 22, 2020 to February 29, 2020 were recruited and grouped based on whether or not LPV/r and ARB were jointly used and whether or not Methylprednisolone was used. Indexes including body temperature, time for nucleic acid negative conversion, hospital stays and laboratory indexes were examined and compared. RESULTS: For all patients, there were no significant differences in the change of body temperature, the time for negative conversion and hospital stays whether LPV/r and ARB were jointly used or not. While for severe and critically severe patients, Methylprednisolone noticeably reduced the time for negative conversion. Meanwhile, the clinical efficacy was superior on patients receiving Methylprednisolone within 3 days upon admission, and the duration of hospital stays was much shorter when Methylprednisolone was given at a total dose of 0-400 mg than a higher dose of >400 mg if all patients received a similar dose per day. Nonetheless, no significant changes across hepatic, renal and myocardial function indexes were observed. CONCLUSION: LPV/r combined with ARB produced no noticeably better effect on COVID-19 patients relative to the single agent treatment. Additionally, Methylprednisolone was efficient in severe and critically severe cases, and superior efficacy could be realized upon its early, appropriate and short-term application.

Regulated childcare services were closed due to the pandemic between March 16 and May 31, 2020, in areas considered ""hot"" (highly affected by the pandemic). During this time, some centers were transformed into ""emergency childcare services"" available to parents considered to be essential workers. Therefore, few children attended, and most educators worked remotely. In May 2020, 372 educators completed an online questionnaire regarding their emotional state, challenges, and learning opportunities. Results indicate that half of the respondents reported a decrease in their level of well-being at work and an increase in their stress level. Educators working remotely were more likely to report a lower level of stress than when working with children at daycare (36.1% vs 19.7%). Despite these findings, educators estimated that the parents who used their emergency childcare service presented either high (37.7%) or average (32.2%) levels of wellbeing. The factors that educators identified as facilitating their interactions with families included parental recognition of their work (11.68%) and direct contact with them (12.62%). While many tasks accomplished at home were done for the first time during this period (i.e., creating video capsules for children and parents, virtual meetings with children and colleagues), a large majority of respondents reported that these tasks made them feel useful. Working at their own pace (34.7%) was seen as the principal advantage of remote working. Finally, 28.84% mentioned that the reduced ratio (1:2 or 1:3) was a facilitating factor that they would like to maintain during the upcoming reopening phase. The discussion uses the Job Demands and Resources theoretical framework (Bakker and Demerouti in Wellbeing 3(2):1-28, 2014; Dicke et al. in J Occupat Health Psychol 23(2): 262-277, 2017) to explain the educators' work-related demands and emotional state in both remote and CPE working pandemic contexts. In conclusion, we argued that this pandemic reveals the complexity, but also the essential nature of the work of early childhood educators, in particular by identifying their needs for support and recognition essential to their professional commitment.","Bigras, Nathalie; Lemay, Lise; Lehrer, Joanne; Charron, Annie; Duval, Stéphanie; Robert-Mazaye, Christelle; Laurin, Et Isabelle",Early Child Educ J,371,16

The purpose of this study was to better understand how the COVID-19 pandemic affected their employment status and day-to-day work. METHODS: A cross-sectional, online survey was conducted (May-June 2020). Recruitment occurred through the National Association of Peer Specialists and additional snowball sampling. Closed- and open-ended questions sought information about employment status, work tasks, challenges faced by PSS and by individuals they supported, and positive impacts they experienced. RESULTS: A total of 1,280 surveys were analyzed. Nine percent of respondents reported having lost their job as a result of COVID-19. Of these, 65% reported a length of employment of 2 or more years, and 61% reported working 35 hours or less per week. Job tasks changed dramatically, with 73% reporting engagement in new tasks, including increased reliance on technology (N=717), increased coordination of resources (N=123), and COVID-19-related tasks (N=142). Engagement in some support tasks decreased significantly from prepandemic levels, including individual support provision (p<0.001) and group facilitation (p<0.001). Respondents reported significant challenges among individuals they supported, including increased isolation (92%), substance use (67%), housing instability (38%), and food insecurity (64%). Although respondents also reported challenges, satisfaction with organizational and supervisory support was high. Most respondents (73%) reported positive impacts or benefits from the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The changing roles and tasks identified in this study have implications for hiring, training, supervising, and supporting peer staff. The peer workforce demonstrated flexibility and commitment to meeting increasing needs.","Adams, Wallis E; Rogers, E Sally; Edwards, Jonathan P; Lord, Emily M; McKnight, Lauren; Barbone, Martha",Psychiatr Serv,371,30

The main difference between our publication and that of Zhang et al. (1), was that we assessed all rare predicted loss-of-function variants (pLOFs) meeting the same criteria in cases and controls, which is a well-established paradigm in the field (2). On the other hand, Zhang et al. included specific variants which were experimentally confirmed only in cases, but not controls, precluding a valid case-control comparison.We matched patients as closely as possible to the previous study, and the inclusion of more severe cases (WHO grades 7-10) should only strengthen the signal against population controls. The use of population controls is standard in such settings and has minimal impact on power, because only a small proportion of individuals exposed to SARS-Cov-2 develop severe disease (3). Additionally, for the pLOF model we report adequate power even for an odds ratio of 5.5, which is considerably lower than the one reported by Zhang et al. We tested the same dominant model as Zhang et al., even though LOF variants in these genes have only been reported to cause disease under recessive inheritance (4).We have serious concerns about confounding by ancestry in the analysis by Zhang et al. in which the pLOF carriers were mostly European, but functionally validated missense variants were found in various nationalities from Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. Because the rates of pLOFs vary considerably across populations, adjusting for only 3 principal components of ancestry in rare-variant association tests of multi-ethnic cohorts does not provide adequate control for population structure.While we noted that age differences may contribute to the discrepancies between the two studies, Zhang et al. do not discuss the role of age in the interpretation of their results stating: ""Inborn errors of TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN immunity at eight loci were found in as many as 23 patients (3.5%) of various ages (17 to 77 years) and ancestries (various nationalities from Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East) and in patients of both sexes."" We also note that the patients with autoantibodies were not excluded from the primary analysis by Zhang et al., but this was done only in the post-hoc analysis.Most importantly, our negative findings are in full agreement with the recently published independent study of 586,157 individuals, including 20,952 cases of COVID-19 (4,928 hospitalized and 1,304 requiring ventilation or resulting in death) (5). There were no significant associations with any of the 13 candidate genes examined either individually or in aggregate, or when comparisons included all hospitalized cases or only the most severe cases. Indeed, none of the associations displayed even marginal significance. Therefore, consistent with our study, these findings do not support substantial contributions of inborn errors in type I IFN immunity to COVID-19 severity.These negative results underscore the importance of proper study design, selection of appropriate genetic models, adequate control for genetic ancestry, and adherence to unbiased methods for genetic discovery rather than focusing only on a candidate biological pathway.","Povysil, Gundula; Butler-Laporte, Guillaume; Gharavi, Ali G; Richards, J Brent; Goldstein, David B; Kiryluk, Krzysztof",J. clin. invest,371,16

A dose-response relationship has been demonstrated, whereby increasing sedentary time corresponds with increasing mortality rate. This study aimed to identify current levels of sedentary behaviour among General Practitioners (GPs), by examining and synthesising how sedentary behaviour has been measured in the primary care literature. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify studies relating to levels of sedentary behaviour among GPs. Searches were performed using Medline®, Embase®, PscycINFO, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library, from inception of databases until January 2020, with a subsequent search of grey literature. Articles were assessed for quality and bias, with extraction of relevant data. RESULTS: The search criteria returned 1707 studies. Thirty four full texts were reviewed and 2 studies included in the final review. Both were cross-sectional surveys using self-reported estimation of sedentary time within the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Keohane et al. examined GP trainees and GP trainers in Ireland. 60% reported spending in excess of 7 h sitting each day, 24% between 4 and 7 h, and 16% less than or equal to 4 h. Suija et al. examined female GPs in Estonia. The mean reported daily sitting time was 6 h and 36 min, with 56% sitting for over 6 h per day. Both studies were of satisfactory methodological quality but had a high risk of bias. CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of research examining current levels of sedentary behaviour among GPs. Objective data is needed to determine GPs' current levels of sedentary behaviour, particularly in light of the increase in remote consulting as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mayne, Richard S; Hart, Nigel D; Heron, Neil",BMC Fam Pract,371,20

METHODS: Ancillary analysis of the OPIOIDS real-world, non-interventional, retrospective, 4-year longitudinal study including patients aged at least 18 years with moderate-to-severe chronic OA pain refractory to standard-of-care with sequential NSAIDs plus opioids. Burden assessment included measurement of analgesia, cognitive functioning, basic activities of daily living, severity and frequency of comorbidities, and all-cause mortality. Costs accounted for healthcare resource utilization and related costs (year 2018). RESULTS: Records of 13,317 patients were analyzed; 68.9 (14.7) years old, 71.3% (70.5-72.1%) women, 58.1% refractory to NSAID plus weak opioid and 41.9% to NSAID plus strong opioid, accounting for 10.7% (10.5-10.8%) of patients with chronic OA pain. Mean number of comorbidities was 2.9 (1.8) and its severity was 1.8 (1.7). Pain decreased by 0.9 points (12.2%) and cognitive declined by 2.3 points (9.1%, with 4.3% more patients with cognitive deficit) and dependency worsened by 0.4 points (0.5%, with 2.3% more patients with severe-to-total dependence) over a mean treatment period of 188.6 (185.4-191.8) days on NSAIDs followed by 400.6 (393.7-407.5) days on opioids. The adjusted mortality rate was higher in patients with OA taking NSAID plus strong opioids; hazard ratio 1.44 (1.26-1.65; p < 0.001). The 4-year healthcare cost was 7350/patient (7193-7507 or 1838/year) and was higher in those taking strong versus weak opioids; 9886 (9608-10,164, 2472/year) vs. 5519 (5349-5689, 1380/year), p < 0.001. Analgesia cost (16.0% of total cost, 70.2% opioids) was higher with strong versus weak opioids, 19.6% vs. 11.3%, p < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: In routine clinical practice in Spain, patients with moderate-to-severe chronic OA pain refractory to standard analgesic treatment with NSAIDs plus opioids reported modest reductions in pain, while presenting a considerable burden of comorbidities, cognitive impairment, and dependency. Healthcare costs significantly increased for the NHS particularly with NSAIDs plus strong opioids.","Sicras-Mainar, Antoni; Rejas-Gutierrez, Javier; Vargas-Negrín, Francisco; Tornero-Tornero, Juan Carlos; Sicras-Navarro, Aram; Lizarraga, Isabel",,371,16

There is therefore the need to identify those patients with COVID-19 who are at highest risk of developing incident AF. We therefore investigated incident AF risks in a large prospective population of elderly patients with/without incident COVID-19 cases and baseline cardiovascular/non-cardiovascular multi-morbidities. We used two approaches: main effect modeling and secondly, a machine-learning (ML) approach, accounting for the complex dynamic relationships among comorbidity variables. METHODS: We studied a prospective elderly US cohort of 280,592 patients from medical databases in an 8-month investigation of with/without newly incident COVID19 cases. Incident AF outcomes were examined in relationship to diverse multi-morbid conditions, COVID-19 status and demographic variables, with ML accounting for the dynamic nature of changing multimorbidity risk factors. RESULTS: Multi-morbidity contributed to the onset of confirmed COVID-19 cases with cognitive impairment (OR 1.69; 95%CI 1.52-1.88), anemia (OR 1.41; 95%CI 1.32-1.50), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.35; 95%CI 1.27-1.44) and vascular disease (OR 1.30; 95%CI 1.21-1.39) having the highest associations. A main effect model (C-index value 0.718) showed that COVID-19 had the highest association with incident AF cases (OR 3.12; 95%CI 2.61-3.710, followed by congestive heart failure (1.72; 95%CI 1.50-1.96), then coronary artery disease (OR 1.43; 95%CI 1.27-1.60) and valvular disease (1.42; 95%CI 1.26-1.60). The ML algorithm demonstrated improved discriminatory validity incrementally over the statistical main effect model (training: C-index 0.729, 95%CI 0.718-0.740; validation: C-index 0.704, 95%CI 0.687-0.72). Calibration of the ML based formulation was satisfactory and better than the main-effect model. Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the clinical utility for the ML based formulation was better than the 'treat all' strategy and the main effect model. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 status has major implications for incident AF in a cohort with diverse cardiovascular/non-cardiovascular multi-morbidities. Our ML approach accounting for dynamic multimorbidity changes had good prediction for new onset AF amongst incident COVID19 cases.","Lip, Gregory Y H; Genaidy, Ash; Tran, George; Marroquin, Patricia; Estes, Cara",Eur. j. intern. med,371,16

COVID-19-related fear and avoidance and COVID-19-related interference were significant predictors of some measures of daily functioning beyond demographics and pain, ßâ¯=â¯.09-.14. However, these associations weakened when psychological flexibility processes were factored into the models, with fear of COVID-19 no longer being a significant predictor of pain-related disability or depression, and COVID-19 avoidance no longer a significant predictor of depression. CONCLUSIONS: The psychological functioning in the context of COVID-19 appears to be negatively associated with daily functioning in people with chronic pain, and is statistically significant in this regard. Psychological flexibility may have a role in these associations for people with chronic pain in the pandemic. PERSPECTIVE: This article demonstrates the psychological implication of COVID-19 and its association with broader emotional and daily functioning in people with chronic pain. It also demonstrates that Psychological flexibility may have a role in these associations for people with chronic pain in the pandemic.","Yu, Lin; Kioskli, Kitty; McCracken, Lance M",J. pain,371,16

The founding members, rhomboids, were first identified in Drosophila as serine intramembrane proteases that cleave transmembrane proteins, enabling signaling. This led to the discovery of the wider rhomboid superfamily, a clan that in metazoans is dominated by pseudoproteases. These so-called rhomboid pseudoproteases inherited from their catalytically active ancestors a conserved rhomboid-like domain and a propensity to regulate signaling. Lacking catalytic activity, they developed new ""pseudoenzyme"" functions that include regulating the trafficking, turnover and activity of their client proteins. Rhomboid pseudoproteases have preeminent roles in orchestrating immune cell activation, antiviral responses and cytokine release in response to microbial infection, or in chronic diseases, and have also been implicated in growth factor signaling, cancer and more recently, metabolism. Here we discuss the mechanism(s) of action of rhomboid pseudoproteases, contrasted with rhomboid proteases. We also highlight the roles of rhomboid pseudoproteases in mammalian physiology, which quite paradoxically among pseudoenzymes, is understood much better than active rhomboids.","Adrain, Colin; Cavadas, Miguel",FEBS j,371,14

We aim to analyze how the SARS-COV-2 pandemic has impacted in the demand for proctological consultations. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Descriptive comparative retrospective study of cross-sectional cohorts of patients attending the ED for proctological complaints from March to April in 2020 and 2019. Demographic variables, comorbidities, reasons for consultation and diagnosis, treatment and readmission were included. Four periods were analyzed according to the different stages of the pandemic derived limitations. RESULTS: A total of 191 patients were reviewed, 58 in 2020 and 133 in 2019 with an average age of 48 years (SD 20.1) and 112 (58.6%) males. The average number of daily consultations was 2.18 patients in 2019 versus 0.95 in 2020 (p=0.025) meaning a 56% reduction in consultations for proctological reasons. This difference in average consultations was significant in both periods of lockout (p=0.001) and previous de-escalation (p=0.014). The diagnosis distribution was similar between both periods; however, perianal abscesses doubled their rate in 2020, 22.4% versus 11.3% (p=0.045). There was an increasing need for surgery, 31% vs 15% (p=0.011) with no difference in outpatients regimen after emergency surgery (12.5% vs 7.5%, p=0.201). Three patients in 2020 required readmission to the ED (5.2% vs 12.9%, p=0.086). CONCLUSION: There was a decrease of a 56% in proctologic emergency consultation, however, the need for surgery was twice more frequent during the study period. Reflection on the use of emergencies for proctological reasons is warranted.","Maqueda Gonzalez, Rocío; Cerdán Santacruz, Carlos; García Septiem, Javier; Blanco Terés, Lara; Lopesino González, Jose María; Fernández Jiménez, Guillermo; Martín-Pérez, Elena",Cir.

Although the majority of patients admitted with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) may not be infected with COVID-19, the quarantine and public health emergency measures may have affected this particular high risk group. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic on ACS admissions and clinical course in a tertiary care hospital in Portugal's most affected region. METHODS: This retrospective, case-control study included patients admitted with a diagnosis of ACS during March and April 2020 (pandemic group) and in the same period in 2019 (control group). Clinical course and complications were also assessed. RESULTS: During the pandemic, there were fewer ACS admissions but presentation was more severe, with a larger proportion of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (54.9% vs. 38.8%, p=0.047), higher maximum troponin levels and greater prevalence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction at discharge (58.0% vs. 35.0%, p=0.01). In this population, although not statistically significant, it was observed a delay between the onset of symptoms and percutaneous coronary intervention, which may traduce a deferred search for urgent medical care during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The lockdown phase of COVID-19 pandemic was associated with fewer and more severe ACS in a Tertiary Care Hospital in Portugal's most affected region by the pandemic.","Calvão, João; Amador, Ana Filipa; Costa, Catarina Martins da; Araújo, Paulo Maia; Pinho, Teresa; Freitas, João; Amorim, Sandra; Macedo, Filipe","Rev. port. cardiol.

New Zealand had a rapid and effective lockdown that meant the virtual elimination of community transmission. METHOD: Twenty-seven semi-structured interviews were undertaken with low-income people in June-July 2020 immediately after lockdown was lifted. RESULTS: Life during lockdown was challenging for study participants. They were fearful of the virus and experienced mental distress and isolation. Most participants felt safe at home and reported coping financially while still experiencing financial stress. Participants were resourceful and resilient. They coped with lockdown by using technology, self-help techniques and support from others. New Zealand's welfare state ensured participants had access to health services and welfare payments, but there were challenges. Welfare payments did not fully meet participants' needs, and support from charitable organisations was critical. Participants were overwhelmingly positive about the Government's response and advised the Government to take the same approach in the future. This is a particularly reassuring finding from some of the most vulnerable New Zealanders. CONCLUSIONS: An early and hard lockdown, the welfare state, compassion and clearly communicated leadership were keys to a successful lockdown for the low-income people in this study. Research of the experience of low-income people during pandemics is critical to ensuring inequities in pandemic impact are mitigated.","Choi, K.; Giridharan, N.; Cartmell, A.; Lum, D.; Signal, L.; Puloka, V.; Crossin, R.; Gray, L.; Davies, C.; Baker, M.; Kvalsvig, A.",New Zealand Medical Journal,371,16

Studies come from various disciplines in the field of the humanities and social sciences. They show in particular that adherence to CT rebounds at every moment of ""crisis"". The health crisis we are experiencing is no exception: COVID-19 pandemic entails an ""infodemic"", according to Tedros Ghebreyesus, General Director of the World Health Organization. Indeed, we are witnessing the production, and international dissemination, of false informations, including conspiracy explanations of the coronavirus and its consequences. This outbreak of CT is an opportunity to examine the psychological and psychopathological issues of this phenomenon in the face of the ""crisis"", whether collective or individual, health or existential. Methodology: We present a review of the important international scientific literature regarding CT related to the health crisis of the COVID-19. Results: Work that addresses CT related to the COVID-19 crisis has resulted in more than fifty publications in recent months. This research is mainly in the fields of social psychology, medical psychology, differential psychology, political science and public health. The rates of adherence to CT related to COVID-19 are of great concern. The literature mentions predisposing factors to the adherence or diffusion of CT on COVID-19: inclination for CT in general, low level of education, low knowledge of the disease, high level of anxiety, acceptance of xenophobic policies, unfavourable attitude towards marginal groups, nationalist stance. Unsurprisingly, there is widespread agreement in the literature that the conspiracy-prone fringe of the population is less likely to comply with government recommendations related to contamination risks, such as handwashing, social distancing, wearing masks, and using diagnostic tests. This crisis thus demonstrates once again that the circulation of false news and adherence to CT is not just a marginal and inconsequential thinking: it concerns a very large part of the population, with a potentially tragic impact in terms of public health. While there is usually no significant difference in adherence to CT according to gender, it would seem that women are less affected by CT related to the COVID than men, regardless of their political affiliation. Finally, studies on the links between adherence to COVID-related CT and stress levels do not seem to reach a consensus. The same uncertainty can be found in work on other types of CT. Conclusion: These results suggest that in order to understand the psychological causes of CT, it may be useful to address the psychodynamic issues underlying adherence to these beliefs. In particular, a psychopathological approach to this phenomenon enables to understand these beliefs as a defensive solution to cope with psychic vulnerability. CT involves overproducing meaning, as delusion does: CT can be considered as the collective, cultural equivalent of a delusional production. Moreover, it is impervious to arguments and evidences, in the same manner as delusion. However, it differs from it by at least two major characteristics: it is shareable and socializing; it gives rise to a consistent attitude.","Poupart, Florent; Bouscail, Manon",Ann. med.-psychol,371,28

Causative agents of coronaviruses belong to Nidovirales order, Coronaviridae family which includes 2 subfamilies: Toroviridna (genera Torovirus and Bafinivirus) and Coronaviridna (genera Alphavirus, Betavirus, Gammavirus). Dividing of the latter by genera (groups I-III) was based on serological cross-reactions. Group I includes pathogens causing diseases in animals, such as swine coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus. Group II includes pathogens of veterinary importance, such as BCoV, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, horse coronavirus, viruses infecting mice and rats, as well as human coronaviruses that cause respiratory damage. Group III includes at the moment only avian coronaviruses. Coronavirus got its name in 1968 because of its special structure and appearance – it has spikes which resemble solar corona. In humans, coronavirus was first isolated by D. Tyrrell and M. Bynoe in 1965 from a patient with acute respiratory disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, and then Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 made specialists significantly increase the level of epidemic danger of coronaviruses. Due to its high virulence, virus multiplication rate in macrophages, pathogen replication, and antibody production increase significantly. At the end of 2019, coronavirus strain 2019-nCoV of Betacoronavirus genus was found in patients with pneumonia in China, and by early 2020 it spread all around the world. In animals, coronavirus leads to damage to mucous membranes. The amount of economic damage associated with disease caused by coronavirus is significant and includes death of animals, decreased meat and dairy productivity, decreased weight gain, culling, loss from abortion and infertility. In this regard, a demand arose for developing project of a device for express analysis for Coronaviridae antigen for the early diagnosis of coronaviruses. Based on the express analysis technique using solid-phase immunochromatographic medium, a project for express analysis for Coronaviridae antigen based on Omron industrial programmable logic controller was developed; it includes process chart for equipment, functional diagram and logical equations.","Kostarev, S.

We surveyed all NHS hospitals where surgery is undertaken. Response rates, by round, were 64%, 56% and 51%. Despite important regional variations, the surveys showed increasing systemic pressure on anaesthetic and peri-operative services due to the need to support critical care pandemic demands. During Rounds 1 and 2, approximately one in eight anaesthetic staff were not available for anaesthetic work. Approximately one in five operating theatres were closed and activity fell in those that were open. Some mitigation was achieved by relocation of surgical activity to other locations. Approximately one-quarter of all surgical activity was lost, with paediatric and non-cancer surgery most impacted. During January 2021, the system was largely overwhelmed. Almost one-third of anaesthesia staff were unavailable, 42% of operating theatres were closed, national surgical activity reduced to less than half, including reduced cancer and emergency surgery. Redeployed anaesthesia staff increased the critical care workforce by 125%. Three-quarters of critical care units were so expanded that planned surgery could not be safely resumed. At all times, the greatest resource limitation was staff. Due to lower response rates from the most pressed regions and hospitals, these results may underestimate the true impact. These findings have important implications for understanding what has happened during the COVID-19 pandemic, planning recovery and building a system that will better respond to future waves or new epidemics.","Kursumovic, E; Cook, T M; Vindrola-Padros, C; Kane, A D; Armstrong, R A; Waite, O; Soar, J",Anaesthesia (Lond.),371,16

Renal patients undergoing hemodialysis run the risk not only of suffering but also of transmitting and spreading COVID-19 due to multiple factors, both procedural and logistical, associated with the process. These include the long duration of the technique, collective transfer to and from the centres, and the waiting time before performing the technique, aspects that make strict isolation difficult and therefore increase not only the risk of contagion between patients but also between specialist health professionals, which makes it more difficult to replace professionals.

However, the positive impacts on the environment are not expected to last long as countries have started to gradually come out of lockdown and engage in aggressive measures to regain the pre-COVID-19 levels of economic activity. The present study provides for an assessment of air quality changes during the period of lockdown and unlocking across 9 major cities in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, including three cities (Ghaziabad, Noida, and Greater Noida) in the national capital region, which have frequently been included among the most polluted cities in the world. The pollutant load in a vertical column of air during March-July 2020 has been analyzed and compared with the corresponding period's pollution load in 2019. In addition, a detailed analysis of the ground-level changes in pollution load for Ghaziabad, Noida, and Greater Noida is also presented, along with the changes in local meteorology. A significant reduction in the total column density of NO2, CO and ground-level pollution load of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and SO2 have been observed. In contrast, an increase in total column density of SO2 across all the cities (except Kanpur) and ground-level concentration of CO (in Noida and Greater Noida) and O3 (in Noida) was evident. The improvement in air quality (with respect to particulate matter) can primarily be attributed to the restrictions on construction and demolition activities, reduced re-suspension of roadside dust, and the restrictions on the movement of vehicles. A significant decline in the average summer temperature was recorded, and it can plausibly be attributed to lower radiative forcing due to reduced pollutant load in the atmosphere.","Kumar, Dipesh; Singh, Anil Kumar; Kumar, Vaibhav; Poyoja, R; Ghosh, Ashok; Singh, Bhaskar",Environ Pollut,371,26

METHODS: We searched LitCovid, medRxiv, Google Scholar and the WHO Covid-19 database for Covid-19 to 10 September 2020. We included studies attempting to culture or observe SARS-CoV-2 in specimens with RT-PCR positivity. Studies were dual extracted and the data summarised narratively by specimen type. Where necessary we contacted corresponding authors of included papers for additional information. We assessed quality using a modified QUADAS 2 risk of bias tool. RESULTS: We included 29 studies reporting attempts at culturing, or observing tissue infection by, SARS-CoV-2 in sputum, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal, urine, stool, blood and environmental specimens. The quality of the studies was moderate with lack of standardised reporting. The data suggest a relationship between the time from onset of symptom to the timing of the specimen test, cycle threshold (Ct) and symptom severity. Twelve studies reported that Ct values were significantly lower and log copies higher in specimens producing live virus culture. Two studies reported the odds of live virus culture reduced by approximately 33% for every one unit increase in Ct. Six of eight studies reported detectable RNA for longer than 14 days but infectious potential declined after day 8 even among cases with ongoing high viral loads. Four studies reported viral culture from stool specimens. CONCLUSION: Complete live viruses are necessary for transmission, not the fragments identified by PCR. Prospective routine testing of reference and culture specimens and their relationship to symptoms, signs and patient co-factors should be used to define the reliability of PCR for assessing infectious potential. Those with high cycle threshold are unlikely to have infectious potential.","Jefferson, T; Spencer, E A; Brassey, J; Heneghan, C",Clin. infect. dis,371,26

444450,444450,444450,Increased Morbidity and Mortality in COVID-19 Patients with Liver Injury,16.395132,9.211709,2021,"BACKGROUND: Mortality is a key component of the natural history of COVID-19 infection. Surveillance data on COVID-19 deaths and case diagnoses are widely available in the public domain, but they are not used to model time to death because they typically do not link diagnosis and death at an individual level. This paper demonstrates that by comparing the unlinked patterns of new diagnoses and deaths over age and time, age-specific mortality and time to death may be estimated using a statistical method called deconvolution. METHODS: Age-specific data were analysed on 816 deaths among 6235 cases over age 50 years in Victoria, Australia, from the period January through December 2020. Deconvolution was applied assuming logistic dependence of case fatality risk (CFR) on age and a gamma time to death distribution. Non-parametric deconvolution analyses stratified into separate age groups were used to assess the model assumptions. RESULTS: It was found that age-specific CFR rose from 2.9% at age 65 years (95% CI:2.2 - 3.5) to 40.0% at age 95 years (CI: 36.6 - 43.6). The estimated mean time between diagnosis and death was 18.1 days (CI: 16.9 - 19.3) and showed no evidence of varying by age (heterogeneity P = 0.97). The estimated 90% percentile of time to death was 33.3 days (CI: 30.4 - 36.3; heterogeneity P = 0.85). The final age-specific model provided a good fit to the observed age-stratified mortality patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Deconvolution was demonstrated to be a powerful analysis method that could be applied to extensive data sources worldwide. Such analyses can inform transmission dynamics models and CFR assessment in emerging outbreaks. Based on these Australian data it is concluded that death from COVID-19 occurs within three weeks of diagnosis on average but takes five weeks in 10% of fatal cases. Fatality risk is negligible in the young but rises above 40% in the elderly, while time to death does not seem to vary by age.","Marschner, Ian C",BMC Med Res Methodol,371,1

Indeed, there is no clinical trial evidence that a dietary or pharmacological supplementation of any particular substance will increase the effectiveness of the immune defences. There are however three nutritional issues that deserve special attention under the present circumstances, namely vitamin D deficiency, excess salt intake and inappropriate alcohol consumption. Here is a short review of the current knowledge about the possible role of these factors in the immunity defence system and their potential impact on the modulation of the immune response to SARS-COV2 infection. DATA SYNTHESIS: For all of these factors there is convincing evidence of an impact on the immune defence structure and function. In the absence of RCT demonstration that increased ingestion of any given substance may confer protection against the new enemy, special attention to correction of these three nutritional criticisms is certainly warranted at the time of COVID pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the inappropriate intake of salt and alcohol and the risk of inadequate vitamin D status should be object of screening, in particular in subjects at high mortality risk from SARS-COV 2 infection, such as institutionalised elderly subjects and all those affected by predisposing conditions.","Iaccarino Idelson, Paola; Rendina, Domenico; Strazzullo, Pasquale",Nutr. metab. cardiovasc. dis,371,2

More comprehensive immunisation regimens, strengthening of HIV prevention and management programmes and improved socioeconomic conditions have impacted on the epidemiology of paediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in South Africa (SA). Objectives. To summarise effective preventive strategies to reduce the burden of childhood CAP. Methods. An expert subgroup reviewed existing SA guidelines and new publications focusing on prevention. Published evidence on pneumonia prevention informed the revisions; in the absence of evidence, expert opinion was used. Evidence was graded using the British Thoracic Society (BTS) grading system. Recommendations. General measures for prevention include minimising exposure to tobacco smoke or air pollution, breastfeeding, optimising nutrition, optimising maternal health from pregnancy onwards, adequate antenatal care and improvement in socioeconomic and living conditions. Prevention of viral transmission, including SARS-CoV-2, can be achieved by hand hygiene, environmental decontamination, use of masks and isolation of infected people. Specific preventive measures include vaccines as contained in the Expanded Programme on Immunisation schedule, isoniazid prophylaxis for tuberculosis, co-trimoxazole prophylaxis for HIV-infected infants and children who are immunosuppressed, and timely diagnosis of HIV, as well as antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. HIV-infected children treated with ART from early infancy, and HIV-exposed children, have similar immunogenicity and immune responses to most childhood vaccines as HIV-unexposed infants. Validation. These recommendations are based on available published evidence supplemented by the consensus opinion of SA paediatric experts, and are consistent with those in published international guidelines.","Zar, H.

A Systemic Review of the Evidence,16.601452,9.010785,2020,"BackgroundThe emergence of strains of SARS-CoV-2 exhibiting increase viral fitness and immune escape potential, such as the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), raises concerns in immunocompromised patients. To what extent Delta evades vaccine-induced immunity in immunocompromised individuals with systemic inflammatory diseases remains unclear. MethodsWe conducted a prospective study in patients with systemic inflammatory diseases (cases) and controls receiving two doses of BNT162b2. Primary end points were anti-spike antibodies levels and cross-neutralization of Alpha and Delta variants after BNT162b2 vaccine. Secondary end points were T-cell responses, breakthrough infections and safety. ResultsSixty-four cases and 21 controls not previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed. Kinetics of anti-spike IgG and IgA after BNT162b2 vaccine showed lower and delayed induction in cases, more pronounced with rituximab. Administration of two doses of BNT162b2 generated a neutralizing response against Alpha and Delta in 100% of controls, while sera from only one of rituximab-treated patients neutralized Alpha (5%) and none Delta. Other therapeutic regimens induced a partial neutralizing activity against Alpha, even lower against Delta. All controls and cases except those treated with methotrexate mounted a SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell response. Methotrexate abrogated T-cell responses after one dose and dramatically impaired T-cell responses after 2 doses of BNT162b2. ConclusionsRituximab and methotrexate differentially impact the immunogenicity of BNT162b2, by impairing B-cell and T-cell responses, respectively. Delta fully escapes the humoral response of individuals treated with rituximab. These findings support efforts to improve BNT162b2 immunogenicity in immunocompromised individuals (Funded by the Fonds IMMUNOV; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04870411).","Hadjadj, Jerome; Planas, Delphine; Ouedrani, Amani; Buffier, Solene; Delage, Laure; Nguyen, Yann; Bruel, Timothee; Stolzenberg, Marie-Claude; STAROPOLI, Isabelle; Ermak, Natalia; Macraigne, Laure; Morbieu, Caroline; Henriquez, Soledad; Veyer, David; Pere, Helene; Casadevall, Marion; Mouthon, Luc; Rieux-Laucat, Frederic; Chatenoud, Lucienne; Schwartz, Olivier; Terrier, Benjamin",,371,30

Radar based sensing with its unbeatable unique features has been a promising solution for identifying and distinguishing human activities in recent years. The ascent of loss of life among elderly people in care homes during COVID-19 is mainly due to poor monitoring services, that was not able to track their daily life activities. This has even more emphasized the need for savvy activity monitoring and tracking system. In this work, we have used a dataset that has captured six daily life activities of people from different locations during different times under realistic environments, unlike an regular controlled data collection environment. We have proposed a novel tower based convolutional neural network architecture that has employed parallel input layers with individual color channel images sent as inputs to the model. We have concatenated all the unique signature features from each channel to have better and robust feature representation to the model. We have analyzed the proposed model with different color spaces like RGB, LAB, HSV as inputs and found that our chosen input type performs better with the proposed model with significant test accuracy results. We have also compared our proposed model with other existing state of art architectures for radar based human activity recognition.

Various studies have demonstrated their association with clinical and psychological factors, including depression, anxiety, aggression, anger expression, and behavioral inhibition, and behavioral activation systems. However, these two addictions are also highly correlated with each other, so the consideration of the relationship between internet and smartphone addiction can enhance the analysis. In this study, we considered the copula regression model to regress the bivariate addictions on clinical and psychological factors. Real data analysis with 555 students (age range: 14-15 years; males, N = 295; females, N = 265) from South Korean public middle schools is illustrated. By fitting the copula regression model, we investigated the dependency between internet and smartphone addiction and determined the risk factors associated with the two addictions. Furthermore, by comparing the model fits of the copula model with linear regression and generalized linear models, the best copula model was proposed in terms of goodness of fit. Our findings revealed that internet and smartphone addiction are not separate problems, and that associations between them should be considered. Psychological factors, such as anxiety, the behavioral inhibition system, and aggression were also significantly associated with both addictions, while ADHD symptoms were related to internet addiction only. We emphasize the need to establish policies on the prevention, management, and education of addiction.","Lee, Minji; Chung, Sun Ju; Lee, Youngjo; Park, Sera; Kwon, Jun-Gun; Kim, Dai Jin; Lee, Donghwan; Choi, Jung-Seok",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),371,16

We also aimed to discover whether age, sex and other comorbidities might affect the association between dementia and mortality. METHODS: We carried out a systematic literature search using PubMed, SCOPUS, EuropePMC and the Cochrane Central Database. The outcome of interest was mortality, defined as clinically validated mortality/death/non-survivor in the studies. The pooled effect estimates were presented as odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio. RESULTS: A total of 56 577 patients from 10 studies were included. The prevalence of dementia in this pooled analysis was 10% (7-13%). Dementia was associated with increased mortality in both pooled unadjusted (odds ratio 2.80, 95% CI 1.85-4.24, P < 0.001; I2 = 93.7%) and adjusted effect estimates (adjusted odds ratio 1.80, 95% CI 1.45-2.24, P < 0.001; I2 = 72.9%). The association between dementia and mortality was influenced by age (coefficient -0.047, P < 0.001) and hypertension (coefficient -0.009, P = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that dementia was associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 patients. The association was affected by age and comorbidities.

A new ""prudent"" randomised clinical trial""",16.884699,9.191678,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To describe the prevalence, nature and risk factors for the main clinical sequelae in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors who have been discharged from the hospital for more than 3 months. METHODS: This longitudinal study was based on a telephone follow-up survey of COVID-19 patients hospitalized and discharged from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China before 1 March 2020. Demographic and clinical characteristics and self-reported clinical sequelae of the survivors were described and analysed. A cohort of volunteers who were free of COVID-19 and lived in the urban area of Wuhan during the outbreak were also selected as the comparison group. RESULTS: Among 538 survivors (293, 54.5% female), the median (interquartile range) age was 52.0 (41.0-62.0) years, and the time from discharge from hospital to first follow-up was 97.0 (95.0-102.0) days. Clinical sequelae were common, including general symptoms (n = 267, 49.6%), respiratory symptoms (n = 210, 39%), cardiovascular-related symptoms (n = 70, 13%), psychosocial symptoms (n = 122, 22.7%) and alopecia (n = 154, 28.6%). We found that physical decline/fatigue (p < 0.01), postactivity polypnoea (p= 0.04) and alopecia (p < 0.01) were more common in female than in male subjects. Dyspnoea during hospitalization was associated with subsequent physical decline/fatigue, postactivity polypnoea and resting heart rate increases but not specifically with alopecia. A history of asthma during hospitalization was associated with subsequent postactivity polypnoea sequela. A history of pulse &#8805;90 bpm during hospitalization was associated with resting heart rate increase in convalescence. The duration of virus shedding after COVID-19 onset and hospital length of stay were longer in survivors with physical decline/fatigue or postactivity polypnoea than in those without. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical sequelae during early COVID-19 convalescence were common; some of these sequelae might be related to gender, age and clinical characteristics during hospitalization.","Xiong, Qiutang; Xu, Ming; Li, Jiao; Liu, Yinghui; Zhang, Jixiang; Xu, Yu; Dong, Weiguo",Clin. microbiol. infect,371,26

This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of LPR in COVID-19 pediatric patients with mild symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective multicenter analysis included hospitalized children with mild COVID-19 who received LPR at one of 13 hospitals in China from January 1, 2020, to June 1, 2020. Patients treated with LPR were matched with patients not treated with LPR (1:4) according to age, sex, and length of symptom onset and hospitalization. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests were applied to compare differences between groups. Kaplan-Meier probability curves and Cox regression models were used to analyze nasal swab turning negative time (recovery time) and hospital discharge days. RESULTS: In total, 23 patients treated with LPR were matched with 92 untreated controls. The median age of patients was 6 years, and 56.52% of them were male. All patients were discharged from the hospital after being cured. The treatment group had a longer nasal swab turning negative time (hazard ratio [HR] 5.33; 95% CI: 1.94-14.67; p = 0.001) than the control group. LPR treatment was also associated with a longer hospitalization time (HR 2.01; 95% CI: 1.24-3.29; p = 0.005). After adjusting for the influence of LPR treatment, adverse drug reaction events were associated with a longer nasopharyngeal swab negative time (HR 4.67; 95% CI 1.35-16.11; p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: For children with mild COVID-19, LPR is inferior to conventional treatment in reducing virus shedding time and hospitalization duration and is associated with increased adverse reactions.","Lu, J-M; Zhou, A-F; Zhang, X-B; Xu, H; Wang, X-F; Ye, Q-F; Shang, F-N; He, Y-L; Ma, S-L; Cui, Y-X; Chen, R-J; Li, X-Y; Zhai, X-W; Li, Z-P",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,371,16

Prior research suggests that demographic factors, such as gender and age, are associated with greater distress during a global health crisis. Less is known about how emotion regulation impacts levels of distress during a pandemic. The present study aimed to identify predictors of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 2,787) provided demographics, history of adverse childhood experiences, current coping strategies (use of implicit and explicit emotion regulation), and current psychological distress. The overall prevalence of clinical levels of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress was higher than the prevalence outside a pandemic and was higher than rates reported among healthcare workers and survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Younger participants (<45 years), women, and non-binary individuals reported higher prevalence of symptoms across all measures of distress. A random forest machine learning algorithm was used to identify the strongest predictors of distress. Regression trees were developed to identify individuals at greater risk for anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress. Somatization and less reliance on adaptive defense mechanisms were associated with greater distress. These findings highlight the importance of assessing individuals' physical experiences of psychological distress and emotion regulation strategies to help mental health providers tailor assessments and treatment during a global health crisis.","Prout, Tracy A; Zilcha-Mano, Sigal; Aafjes-van Doorn, Katie; Békés, Vera; Christman-Cohen, Isabelle; Whistler, Kathryn; Kui, Thomas; Di Giuseppe, Mariagrazia",Front Psychol,371,29

Evidence has suggested that negative coping styles may be related to subsequent mental illness. Therefore, we investigate the general population's psychological distress and coping styles in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. A cross-sectional battery of surveys was conducted from February 1-4, 2020. The Kessler 6 psychological distress scale, the simplified coping style questionnaire and a general information questionnaire were administered on-line to a convenience sample of 1599 in China. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify the influence factors of psychological distress. General population's psychological distress were significant differences based on age, marriage, epidemic contact characteristics, concern with media reports, and perceived impacts of the epidemic outbreak (all p <0.001) except gender (p = 0.316). The population with younger age (F = 102.04), unmarried (t = 15.28), with history of visiting Wuhan in the past month (t = -40.86), with history of epidemics occurring in the community (t = -10.25), more concern with media reports (F = 21.84), perceived more impacts of the epidemic outbreak (changes over living situations, F = 331.71; emotional control, F = 1863.07; epidemic-related dreams, F = 1642.78) and negative coping style (t = 37.41) had higher level of psychological distress.

DESIGN: Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SECURE-IBD) is a large, international registry created to monitor outcomes of IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19. We used multivariable regression with a generalised estimating equation accounting for country as a random effect to analyse the association of different medication classes with severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit admission, ventilator use and/or death. RESULTS: 1439 cases from 47 countries were included (mean age 44.1 years, 51.4% men) of whom 112 patients (7.8%) had severe COVID-19. Compared with tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist monotherapy, thiopurine monotherapy (adjusted OR (aOR) 4.08, 95% CI 1.73 to 9.61) and combination therapy with TNF antagonist and thiopurine (aOR 4.01, 95% CI 1.65 to 9.78) were associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19. Any mesalamine/sulfasalazine compared with no mesalamine/sulfasalazine use was associated with an increased risk (aOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.29). This risk estimate increased when using TNF antagonist monotherapy as a reference group (aOR 3.52, 95% CI 1.93 to 6.45).

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Otolaryngology Clinic of the University Polyclinic A. Gemelli, IRCCS Foundation. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All patients with voice prosthesis who underwent laryngectomy followed by our institute were offered enrollment. Patients who agreed to participate were interviewed to inquire about the nature of the need and to plan a video call with the appropriate clinician. Before and 1 week after the clinician's call, patients were tested with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Degrees of satisfaction were investigated with a visual analog scale. A comparison between those who accepted and refused telematic support was carried out to identify factors that influence patient interest in teleservice. RESULTS: Video call service allowed us to reach 37 (50.68%) of 73 patients. In 23 (62.16%) of 37 cases, the video call was sufficient to manage the problem. In the remaining 14 cases (37.83%), an outpatient visit was necessary.

However, the impact of COVID-19 among patients with pre-existing liver disease remains ill-defined. METHODS: Data for CLD patients with SARS-CoV-2 were collected by two international registries. Comparisons were made with non-CLD patients with SARS-CoV-2 from a UK hospital network. RESULTS: Between 25th March and 8th July 2020, 745 CLD patients were reported from 29 countries including 386 with cirrhosis and 359 without. Mortality was 32% in patients with cirrhosis compared with 8% in those without (p<0.001). Mortality in cirrhosis patients increased according to Child-Turcotte-Pugh class (CTP-A (19%), CTP-B (35%), CTP-C (51%)) and the main cause of death was respiratory failure (71%). After adjusting for baseline characteristics, factors associated with death in the total CLD cohort were age (OR 1.02; 1.01-1.04), CTP-A (OR 1.90; 1.03-3.52), CTP-B (OR 4.14; 2.4-7.65), CTP-C cirrhosis (OR 9.32; 4.80-18.08) and alcohol related liver disease (ALD) (OR 1.79; 1.03-3.13). When comparing CLD versus non-CLD (n=620) in propensity-score-matched analysis there were significant increases in mortality with CTP-B +20.0% (8.8%-31.3%) and CTP-C cirrhosis +38.1% (27.1%-49.2%). Acute hepatic decompensation occurred in 46% of patients with cirrhosis, of which 21% had no respiratory symptoms. 50% of those with hepatic decompensation had acute-on-chronic liver failure. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest reported cohort of CLD and cirrhosis patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection to date. We demonstrate that baseline liver disease stage and ALD are independent risk factor for death from COVID-19. These data have important implications for the risk stratification of patients with CLD across the globe during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Marjot, Thomas; Moon, Andrew M; Cook, Jonathan A; Abd-Elsalam, Sherief; Aloman, Costica; Armstrong, Matthew J; Pose, Elisa; Brenner, Erica J; Cargill, Tamsin; Catana, Maria-Andreea; Dhanasekaran, Renumathy; Eshraghian, Ahad; García-Juárez, Ignacio; Gill, Upkar S; Jones, Patricia D; Kennedy, James; Marshall, Aileen; Matthews, Charmaine; Mells, George; Mercer, Carolyn; Perumalswami, Ponni V; Avitabile, Emma; Qi, Xialong; Su, Feng; Ufere, Nneka N; Wong, Yu Jun; Zheng, Ming-Hua; Barnes, Eleanor; Barritt, Alfred S; Webb, Gwilym J",J. hepatol,371,30

There is no question that the current global COVID-19 crisis, now more than ever, is underscoring the importance of leveraging digital approaches to optimize pediatric health care delivery in the era of this pandemic. In this perspective piece, we highlight some of the available digital approaches that have been and can continue to be used to streamline remote pediatric patient care in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to telemedicine. JMIR Pediatrics and Parenting is currently publishing a COVID-19 special theme issue in which investigators can share their interim and final research data related to digital approaches to remote pediatric health care delivery in different settings. The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly transformed health care systems worldwide, with significant variations and innovations in adaptation. There has been rapid expansion of the leveraging and optimization of digital approaches to health care delivery, particularly integrated telemedicine and virtual health. Digital approaches have played and will play major roles as invaluable and reliable resources to overcome restrictions and challenges imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic and to increase access to effective, accessible, and consumer-friendly care for more patients and families. However, a number of challenges remain to be addressed, and further research is needed. Optimizing digital approaches to health care delivery and integrating them into the public health response will be an ongoing process during the current COVID-19 outbreak and during other possible future pandemics. Regulatory changes are essential to support the safe and wide adoption of these approaches. Involving all relevant stakeholders in addressing current and future challenges as well as logistical, technological, and financial barriers will be key for success. Future studies should consider evaluating the following research areas related to telemedicine and other digital approaches: cost-effectiveness and return on investment; impact on quality of care; balance in use and number of visits needed for the management of both acute illness and chronic health conditions; system readiness for further adoption in other settings, such as inpatient services, subspecialist consultations, and rural areas; ongoing user-centered evaluations, with feedback from patients, families, and health care providers; strategies to optimize health equity and address disparities in access to care related to race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, immigration status, and rural communities; privacy and security concerns for protected health information with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-secured programs; confidentiality issues for some specific populations, especially adolescents and those in need of mental health services; early detection of exposure to violence and child neglect; and integration of training into undergraduate and graduate medical education and subspecialty fellowships. Addressing these research areas is essential to understanding the benefits, sustainability, safety, and optimization strategies of telemedicine and other digital approaches as key parts of modern health care delivery. These efforts will inform long-term adoption of these approaches with expanded dissemination and implementation efforts.","Badawy, Sherif M; Radovic, Ana",JMIR Pediatr Parent,371,1
454311,454311,454311,Pneumomediastinum as a complication of COVID-19 disease: A case report,16.6227,9.144386,2021,"BACKGROUND: Dalbavancin, albeit indicated for the treatment of skin structure infections, is used for a much wider range of infections. This drug is characterized by a long half-life (more than 200 hours), a favorable safety profile, and an activity against a wide array of gram-positive organisms, including several strains of Staphylococci and Enterococci. METHODS: In this study, we presented 3 cases of critically ill patients treated with dalbavancin. All patients were therapeutically monitored for plasma dalbavancin concentrations; ultrafiltrate dalbavancin concentrations were assessed in a patient undergoing continuous renal-replacement therapy. Dalbavancin concentrations were measured using a validated liquid chromatographic method coupled with mass spectrometry. RESULTS: All 3 severely ill patients experiencing necrotizing fasciitis were successfully treated during the acute phase with dalbavancin. Dalbavancin clearance in patient 3 (0.334 L/h) was considerably increased compared with values measured in the other 2 patients (0.054 and 0.075 L/h) and with data reported in the literature (0.04-0.06 L/h). CONCLUSIONS: Our case reports presented preliminary evidence that dalbavancin can be considered a therapeutic option for necrotizing fasciitis in intensive care unit patients. The role of hypoalbuminemia during dalbavancin exposure merits further investigation.","Corona, Alberto; Agarossi, Andrea; Veronese, Alice; Cattaneo, Dario; DÊ¼Avolio, Antonio",Ther Drug Monit,371,5

The government of Ethiopia takes preventive measures but the number of peoples infected with COVID-19 has been increased. Control of the pandemic requires changing of knowledge, attitude and practice of people. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess chronic disease patients' knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Institution based cross-sectional study was done among 413 chronic disease patients from July 20 to August 5, 2020 in Dessie town hospitals. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used and significant association declared at p-value of <0.05. RESULTS: From the total participants 34.6%, 81.4% and 40.7% had good knowledge, attitude and practice while 35.1%, 12.1% and 24.7% had moderate knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. In multinomial logistic regression young age, urban residency, attainment of secondary education and presence of additional co-morbidity were predictors of moderate knowledge whereas urban residency, not attended formal education and presence of additional co-morbidity were predictors of good knowledge about COVID-19. Household family size and presence of additional co-morbidity were factors significantly associated with moderate practice of COVID-19 prevention methods. Furthermore, male sex, household family size, knowledge of COVID-19 and attitude towards COVID-19 were factors significantly associated with good practice of COVID-19 prevention methods. CONCLUSION: Significant number of chronic disease patients had poor knowledge and practice towards COVID-19. Therefore, government, health professionals, Medias, researchers and health institution should do to improve the gaps of chronic diseases patients.","Addis, Sisay Gedamu; Nega, Abebe Dires; Miretu, Debrnesh Goshiye",Diabetes Metab Syndr,371,9

At the same time, the health system also faces challenges related to shortages of health professionals, low public financing, and informal payments. With the added pressure from the COVID-19 pandemic, Hungarian policymakers acted rapidly to pass a sweeping regulation aimed at these issues. Over two days, the Hungarian parliament introduced and unanimously approved a new regulation, Act C of 2020 on the Employment Status of Health Workers, that replaces the existing public employment relationship between health professionals, public providers and their controlling authorities. The Act, passed on 6 October 2020, brings the employment of health workers under strict central control by introducing a new employment status similar to that of the armed forces. The Act also provides doctors with an unprecedented 120% salary increase and criminalizes informal payments. The reception has been overwhelmingly negative, with thousands of health professionals indicating that they would not sign the new contracts, and the policy also contains serious technical and feasibility concerns. Although the first statistics show that only about 3-5% of the active workforce did not sign the contract by 1 March 2021, the implementation of the reform still faces serious challenges.","Gaal, Peter; Velkey, Zita; Szerencses, Viktoria; Webb, Erin",Health Policy,371,16

We reviewed research priority setting in the field and the involvement of consumers in this priority setting. METHOD: A systematic review following the PRSIMA statement was conducted and eight studies were identified for inclusion; four included substantial input from consumers, and four were researcher led. Similarities and differences across the types of studies were examined. RESULTS: Research priorities informed by consumers were primarily concerned with producing better interventions and outcomes. A large degree of overlap with researcher-led priorities was present. The former studies had a greater focus on early intervention, bridging the research-practice gap, and recovery, while the latter were more likely to address diagnosis, genetic factors, brain circuitry, and pharmacotherapy. Priorities endorsed across more than one consumer-informed study included: the role of self-harm, working with health care professionals to increase early detection, supporting transition between services, and six issues about improved treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The ED field needs to engage in more meaningful involvement of co-design across consumers, clinicians and researchers along the entire research journey, not just research priority setting. An integrated research strategy incorporating a co-design perspective has the potential to drive better outcomes.","Wade, Tracey D; Hart, Laura M; Mitchison, Deborah; Hay, Phillipa",,371,16

This study aimed to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on childhood cancer care worldwide. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to paediatric oncology providers worldwide from June 22 to Aug 21, 2020, through the St Jude Global Alliance and International Society for Paediatric Oncology listservs and regional networks. The survey included 60 questions to assess institution characteristics, the number of patients diagnosed with COVID-19, disruptions to cancer care (eg, service closures and treatment abandonment), adaptations to care, and resources (including availability of clinical staff and personal protective equipment). Surveys were included for analysis if respondents answered at least two thirds of the items, and the responses were analysed at the institutional level. FINDINGS: Responses from 311 health-care professionals at 213 institutions in 79 countries from all WHO regions were included in the analysis. 187 (88%) of 213 centres had the capacity to test for SARS-CoV-2 and a median of two (range 0-350) infections per institutution were reported in children with cancer. 15 (7%) centres reported complete closure of paediatric haematology-oncology services (median 10 days, range 1-75 days). Overall, 2% (5 of 213) of centres were no longer evaluating new cases of suspected cancer, while 43% (90 of 208) of the remaining centers described a decrease in newly diagnosed paediatric cancer cases. 73 (34%) centres reported increased treatment abandonment (ie, failure to initiate cancer therapy or a delay in care of 4 weeks or longer). Changes to cancer care delivery included: reduced surgical care (153 [72%]), blood product shortages (127 [60%]), chemotherapy modifications (121 [57%]), and interruptions to radiotherapy (43 [28%] of 155 institutions that provided radiotherapy before the pandemic). The decreased number of new cancer diagnoses did not vary based on country income status (p=0·14). However, unavailability of chemotherapy agents (p=0·022), treatment abandonment (p<0·0001), and interruptions in radiotherapy (p<0·0001) were more frequent in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. These findings did not vary based on institutional or national numbers of COVID-19 cases. Hospitals reported using new or adapted checklists (146 [69%] of 213), processes for communication with patients and families (134 [63%]), and guidelines for essential services (119 [56%]) as a result of the pandemic. INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably affected paediatric oncology services worldwide, posing substantial disruptions to cancer diagnosis and management, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. This study emphasises the urgency of an equitably distributed robust global response to support paediatric oncology care during this pandemic and future public health emergencies.

Historically, this has been face-to-face with logistical difficulties, high cost, low trainee uptake and challenging in recruiting examiners. Following the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent shift to virtual consultations and examinations, the team implemented an innovative virtual Skills test. The main aims were to improve the test's quality and the trainee uptake, adapt the test delivery to a Health Education England (HEE) online platform, and establish cost-effectiveness in the post-COVID world.MethodA working group was formed to develop the Skills test, and in May 2019, the test was delivered face-to-face, implementing 5 cycles of 8 stations over 3 days. The same group adapted the test for online delivery, and in August 2020, 3 cycles of 8 stations were delivered. Feedback was collected, with adaptations made for a second Skills Test in December 2020.Result96.4% of trainees rated their overall experience and the test organisation in the 2019 test as excellent or good (82.1% and 85.7 excellent, respectively). 93.5% of examiners rated their overall experience and the test organisation as excellent or good (45.1% excellent for both). In the August test, 95.8% of trainees rated their overall experience as excellent or good (58.3% excellent). 100% of trainees rated the test organisation and the online format as excellent or good (70.8% and 50% excellent, respectively). Although 100% of examiners rated the overall experience, the test organisation and online format as excellent or good, some felt the stations were not long enough to allow for technical issues. In the December test, higher proportions of trainees rated the overall experience (80%), organisation of the test (80%) and online format (70%) as excellent.ConclusionThe virtual test is shown to be a viable and successful alternative to the face-to-face test in preparing trainees for their CASC, and trainees felt it was excellent preparation for the new online CASC format. It had some clear advantages, such as saving on consumables, reducing the financial costs of running the test, improving the test quality, and increasing the trainee uptake. It is more eco-friendly and reduces fuel emission, raising the question of how the test should be delivered after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Barakat, Mahmoud Slevin Hannah Nijjar Reshmi Ramamurthy Kavitha Hackett Latha Mahadevan Dushyanthan",BJPsych Open,371,15

METHODS: Consecutive COVID-19 patients with neurological manifestations other than isolated anosmia and/or non-severe headache, and with no previous neurological or psychiatric disorders were prospectively included. Neurological examination was performed in all patients and lumbar puncture with CSF examination was performed when not contraindicated. Serum anti-gangliosides antibodies were tested when clinically indicated. RESULTS: Of the 349 COVID-19 admitted to our center between March 23rd and April 24th 2020, 15 patients (4.3%) had neurological manifestations and fulfilled the study inclusion/exclusion criteria. CSF examination was available in 13 patients and showed lymphocytic pleocytosis in 2 patients: 1 with anti-contactin-associated protein 2 (anti-Caspr2) antibody encephalitis and 1 with meningo-polyradiculitis.

Studies examining the effects of outbreaks have demonstrated both an increased prevalence and long-term development of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms in healthcare providers. We sought to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological well-being of medical providers, medical trainees, and administrators at a large academic center to identify stressors and moderators to guide future mental health and hospital-system interventions. METHODS: A 42-item survey examining specific stressors, grit, and resilience was widely distributed to physicians, residents, fellows, and administrators a large academic institution for departmental distribution. Survey results were analyzed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA, and multivariate linear regressions. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 785 participants completed the survey. The majority of respondents rated their stress to be significantly increased during the pandemic. Respondents' fear of transmitting the virus to their family members was a significant stressor. Higher resilience was associated with lower stress, anxiety, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. Overall, respondents felt supported by their departments and institution and felt contingency plans and personal protective equipment were adequate. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers have increased resilience in the face of heightened stress during a pandemic.

We performed a retrospective study of patients 18 years of age and under admitted to four New York hospitals in the Northwell Health System interned during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, between March 9 and August 13, 2020. Acute kidney injury was defined and staged according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. The cohort included 152 patients; 97 acute-COVID-19 and 55 with MIS-C associated with COVID-19. Acute kidney injury occurred in 8 with acute-COVID-19 and in 10 with MIS-C. Acute kidney injury, in unadjusted models, was associated with a lower serum albumin level (odds ratio 0.17; 95% confidence interval 0.07, 0.39) and higher white blood cell counts (odds ratio 1.11; 95% confidence interval 1.04, 1.2). Patients with MIS-C and acute kidney injury had significantly greater rates of systolic dysfunction, compared to those without (80% vs 49%). In unadjusted models, patients with acute kidney injury had 8.4 days longer hospitalizations compared to patients without acute kidney injury (95% confidence interval, 4.4-6.7). Acute kidney injury in acute-COVID-19 and MIS-C may be related to inflammation and/or dehydration. Further research in larger pediatric cohorts is needed to better characterize risk factors for acute kidney injury in acute-COVID-19 and with MIS-C consequent to COVID-19.","Basalely, Abby; Gurusinghe, Shari; Schneider, James; Shah, Sareen S; Siegel, Linda B; Pollack, Gabrielle; Singer, Pamela; Castellanos-Reyes, Laura J; Fishbane, Steven; Jhaveri, Kenar D; Mitchell, Elizabeth; Merchant, Kumail; Capone, Christine; Gefen, Ashley M; Steinberg, Julie; Sethna, Christine B",Kidney Int,371,26

The way capital organises production and reproduction combines with structures of oppression, generating vulnerability among the racialised and gendered populations worst impacted by Covid-19. Using global data, this commentary shows that during the pandemic, women experienced relatively greater employment losses, were more likely to work in essential jobs, and experienced a greater reduction in income. Women were also doing more reproductive labour than men and were more likely to drop out of the labour force because of it. Analyses of capitalism in feminist political economy illustrate how capital accumulation depends on women's oppression in multiple, fundamental ways having to do with their paid and unpaid work. Women's work, and by extension their health, is the foundation upon which both production and social reproduction rely. Recognising the pandemic as endogenous to capitalism heightens the contradiction between a world shaped by the profit motive and the domestic and global requirements of public health.","Cohen, Jennifer; van der Meulen Rodgers, Yana",Glob Public Health,371,16

Given its recent appearance, our current knowledge about the possible influence that this disease can exert on pregnancy is very limited. One of the unknowns to be solved is whether there is a vertical transmission of the infection during pregnancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction techniques for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids, the possible presence of this germ in vaginal discharge and amniotic fluid was investigated in four pregnant Caucasian patients affected by mild acute symptoms of COVID-19 during the second trimester of pregnancy. RESULTS: There is no laboratory evidence to suggest a possible passage of SARS-CoV-2 from the infected mother to the amniotic fluid. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to expand the investigation of COVID-19 cases diagnosed during pregnancy to clarify the real influence that SARS-CoV-2 has on pregnant women and their offspring, as well as those factors that modulate the disease.","Hijona Elósegui, J J; Carballo García, A L; Fernández Risquez, A C; Bermúdez Quintana, M; Expósito Montes, J F",Rev. clin. esp.

We aimed at studying the impact of the implicated gene(s) on the disease course. METHODS: The Nordic ARVC Registry holds data on a multinational cohort of ARVC families. The effects of genotype on electrocardiographic features, imaging findings and clinical events were analysed. RESULTS: We evaluated 419 patients (55% men), with a mean follow-up of 11.2±7.4 years. A pathogenic desmosomal variant was identified in 62% of the 230 families: PKP2 in 41%, DSG2 in 13%, DSP in 7% and DSC2 in 3%. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &#8804;45% on cardiac MRI was more frequent among patients with DSC2/DSG2/DSP than PKP2 ARVC (27% vs 4%, p<0.01). In contrast, in Cox regression modelling of patients with definite ARVC, we found a higher risk of arrhythmias among PKP2 than DSC2/DSG2/DSP carriers: HR 0.25 (0.10-0.68, p<0.01) for atrial fibrillation/flutter, HR 0.67 (0.44-1.0, p=0.06) for ventricular arrhythmias and HR 0.63 (0.42-0.95, p<0.05) for any arrhythmia. Gene-negative patients had an intermediate risk (16%) of LVEF &#8804;45% and a risk of the combined arrhythmic endpoint comparable with DSC2/DSG2/DSP carriers. Male sex was a risk factor for both arrhythmias and reduced LVEF across all genotype groups (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of ARVC families with long-term follow-up, we found PKP2 genotype to be more arrhythmic than DSC2/DSG2/DSP or gene-negative carrier status, whereas reduced LVEF was mostly seen among DSC2/DSG2/DSP carriers. Male sex was associated with a more severe phenotype.","Christensen, Alex Hørby; Platonov, Pyotr G; Jensen, Henrik Kjærulf; Chivulescu, Monica; Svensson, Anneli; Dahlberg, Pia; Madsen, Trine; Frederiksen, Tanja Charlotte; Heliö, Tiina; Lie, Øyvind Haugen; Haugaa, Kristina H; Hastrup Svendsen, Jesper; Bundgaard, Henning",J. medical. genet,371,1

This editorial discusses the current situation regarding digital health solutions to fight COVID-19 as well as the challenges and ethical hurdles to broad and long-term implementation of these solutions. To decrease the risk of infection, telemedicine has been used as a successful health care model in both emergency and primary care. Official communication plans should promote facile and diverse channels to inform people about the pandemic and to avoid rumors and reduce threats to public health. Social media platforms such as Twitter and Google Trends analyses are highly beneficial to model pandemic trends as well as to monitor the evolution of patients' symptoms or public reaction to the pandemic over time. However, acceptability of digital solutions may face challenges due to potential conflicts with users' cultural, moral, and religious backgrounds. Digital tools can provide collective public health benefits; however, they may be intrusive and can erode individual freedoms or leave vulnerable populations behind. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the strong potential of various digital health solutions that have been tested during the crisis. More concerted measures should be implemented to ensure that future digital health initiatives will have a greater impact on the epidemic and meet the most strategic needs to ease the life of people who are at the forefront of the crisis.","Fagherazzi, Guy; Goetzinger, Catherine; Rashid, Mohammed Ally; Aguayo, Gloria A; Huiart, Laetitia",J Med Internet Res,371,32

The present report is of a case of hyponatremia and encephalopathy due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) as the main presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 55-year-old woman. CASE REPORT A 55-year-old woman with type II diabetes mellitus presented with confusion and slurring of speech, with a temperature of 38.5°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 159/81 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. She did not have edema on examination. Laboratory testing showed a low sodium level of 116 mEq/L (reference range, 135-145 mEq/L) with urine osmolarity of 364 mOsm/kg, urinary sodium of 69 mEq/L, urinary potassium of 15.6 mEq/L, and serum osmolarity of 251 mOsm/kg. The patient had normal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and cortisol levels. A chest X-ray should no pulmonary infiltrates nor did a lumbar puncture reveal signs of infection. A real-time SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction assay was positive for COVID-19. Brain imaging with computed tomography was negative for acute infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, and mass effect. Based on findings from laboratory testing and physical examination, a diagnosis of SIADH was made. The patient was treated with 3% hypertonic saline, followed by salt tablets and fluid restriction, with improvement in her clinical symptoms and serum sodium level. CONCLUSIONS The present report is of a rare but previously reported association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Encephalopathy and hyponatremia associated with SIADH without pneumonia or other symptoms of infection should be an indication for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sherazi, Andleeb; Bedi, Puneet; Udevbulu, Ehizode; Rubin, Vadim; Alasadi, Lutfi; Spitalewitz, Samuel",Am J Case Rep,371,20

Methods: We developed a decision analysis model to evaluate two treatment strategies for both low-risk and intermediate-risk patients with aortic stenosis during the 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic. Results: Prompt transcatheter aortic valve replacement resulted in improved 2-year overall survival when compared to delayed intervention for intermediate-risk patients (0.81 versus 0.67) and low-risk patients (0.95 vs 0.85), due to the risk of death or the need for urgent/emergent transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the waiting period. However, if the probability of acquiring the 2019 novel coronavirus is greater than 55% (intermediate risk patients) or 47% (low risk patients), delayed transcatheter aortic valve replacement is favorable to prompt intervention (0.66 vs 0.67, intermediate risk; 0.84 vs 0.85, low risk).

This paper aims to present understandable solutions based on Machine Learning (ML) techniques to deal with COVID-19 screening in routine blood tests. We tested different ML classifiers in a public dataset from the Hospital Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil. After cleaning and pre-processing the data has 608 patients, of which 84 are positive for COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR. To understand the model decisions, we introduce (i) a local Decision Tree Explainer (DTX) for local explanation and (ii) a Criteria Graph to aggregate these explanations and portrait a global picture of the results. Random Forest (RF) classifier achieved the best results (accuracy 0.88, F1-score 0.76, sensitivity 0.66, specificity 0.91, and AUROC 0.86). By using DTX and Criteria Graph for cases confirmed by the RF, it was possible to find some patterns among the individuals able to aid the clinicians to understand the interconnection among the blood parameters either globally or on a case-by-case basis. The results are in accordance with the literature and the proposed methodology may be embedded in an electronic health record system.","Alves, Marcos Antonio; Castro, Giulia Zanon; Oliveira, Bruno Alberto Soares; Ferreira, Leonardo Augusto; Ramírez, Jaime Arturo; Silva, Rodrigo; Guimarães, Frederico Gadelha",Comput Biol Med,371,20

There are more than 3.5 million confirmed cases and around 165,000 to 243,000 fatalities. The primary manifestation is respiratory and cardiac but neurological features are also being reported in the literature as case reports and case series. The most common reported symptoms to include headache and dizziness followed by encephalopathy and delirium. Among the complications noted are Cerebrovascular accident, Guillian barre syndrome, acute transverse myelitis, and acute encephalitis. The most common peripheral manifestation was hyposmia. It is further noted that sometimes the neurological manifestations can precede the typical features like fever and cough and later on typical manifestations develop in these patients. Hence a high index of suspicion is required for timely diagnosis and isolation of cases to prevent the spread in neurology wards. We present a narrative review of the neurological manifestations and complications of COVID-19. Our aim is to update the neurologists and physicians working with suspected cases of COVID-19 about the possible neurological presentations and the probable neurological complications resulting from this novel virus infection.","Ahmad, Imran; Rathore, Farooq Azam",J Clin Neurosci,371,2

Using data from the Axios/Ipsos Coronavirus Survey from November 2020 to February 2021, the authors find that this partisan divide in vaccine hesitancy has increased over time. Recent scholarship has suggested that these differences can be attributed to personal characteristics, including varying levels of trust in institutions. The authors find that although the data supported this hypothesis in mid-November, by early February differences in demographics, concern about the pandemic, and institutional trust no longer explained the partisan gap. The authors explain the deepening divide by turning to recent evidence that political party affiliation has become a source of identity that shapes personal decision making. © The Author(s) 2021.","Cowan, S.

In the last months, various signs showed that the COVID-19 curve was flattening, but even the partial lifting of some containment measures (e.g., school closures and telecommuting) appear to favor a second wave of the disease. The accurate evaluation of possible countermeasures and their well-timed revocation are therefore crucial to avoid future waves or reduce their duration. In this paper, we analyze patient and route data of infected patients from January 20, 2020, to May 31, 2020, collected by the Korean Center for Disease Control&Prevention (KCDC).

The majority of COVID-19 prognostic tools use only data present upon admission and do not incorporate changes occurring after admission. OBJECTIVE: To develop the Severe COVID-19 Adaptive Risk Predictor (SCARP) (https://rsconnect.biostat.jhsph.edu/covid_trajectory/), a novel tool that can provide dynamic risk predictions for progression from moderate disease to severe illness or death in patients with COVID-19 at any time within the first 14 days of their hospitalization. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Five hospitals in Maryland and Washington, D.C. PATIENTS: Patients who were hospitalized between 5 March and 4 December 2020 with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) confirmed by nucleic acid test and symptomatic disease. MEASUREMENTS: A clinical registry for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was the primary data source; data included demographic characteristics, admission source, comorbid conditions, time-varying vital signs, laboratory measurements, and clinical severity. Random forest for survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (RF-SLAM) data analysis was applied to predict the 1-day and 7-day risks for progression to severe disease or death for any given day during the first 14 days of hospitalization. RESULTS: Among 3163 patients admitted with moderate COVID-19, 228 (7%) became severely ill or died in the next 24 hours; an additional 355 (11%) became severely ill or died in the next 7 days. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) for 1-day risk predictions for progression to severe disease or death was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.88 to 0.90) and 0.89 (CI, 0.87 to 0.91) during the first and second weeks of hospitalization, respectively. The AUC for 7-day risk predictions for progression to severe disease or death was 0.83 (CI, 0.83 to 0.84) and 0.87 (CI, 0.86 to 0.89) during the first and second weeks of hospitalization, respectively. LIMITATION: The SCARP tool was developed by using data from a single health system. CONCLUSION: Using the predictive power of RF-SLAM and longitudinal data from more than 3000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, an interactive tool was developed that rapidly and accurately provides the probability of an individual patient's progression to severe illness or death on the basis of readily available clinical information.

It appeared that some higher educational institutions and a certain part of their students were almost ready to go online as these institutions had been developing their online platforms thus integrating traditional face-to-face classes with computer-assisted learning as well as integrating massive open or shared online courses into their curricular. At the same time, many other universities and institutes proved to be absolutely unprepared to shift online as they and their students had neither their own educational environment and online resources developed by their teaching staff nor any experience of working in an external online environment and choosing courses appropriate for their educational purposes. It turned out that most existing online courses could not be successfully used for implementing into most universities curricula and for teaching a majority of technical students as they simply reproduced the traditional classroom learning process and missed all advantages and opportunities afforded by online learning environments. The authors objective for this research in progress is to identify the key features and describe structure, content and assessment specifics of an academical online course for technical students. This paper provides tips on how to organize the course content into a proper structure stressing what types of teaching materials could be uploaded to the educational platform and goes into its assessment specifics.

Occupational characteristics, such as interfacing with the public and being in close quarters with other workers, not only put workers at high risk for disease, but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community. This can further be exacerbated through presenteeism, the term used to describe the act of coming to work despite being symptomatic for disease. Quantifying the number of workers who are frequently exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, and understanding which occupational groups they represent, can help to prompt public health risk response and management for COVID-19 in the workplace, and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks. METHODS: To estimate the number of United States workers frequently exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, national employment data (by Standard Occupational Classification) maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with a BLS O*NET survey measure reporting how frequently workers in each occupation are exposed to infection or disease at work. This allowed us to estimate the number of United States workers, across all occupations, exposed to disease or infection at work more than once a month. RESULTS: Based on our analyses, approximately 10% (14.4 M) of United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week. Approximately 18.4% (26.7 M) of all United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month. While the majority of exposed workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high proportions of exposed workers. These include protective service occupations (e.g. police officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g. couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g. preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations (e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair). CONCLUSIONS: The large number of persons employed in occupations with frequent exposure to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response plans for COVID-19. Given the proportion of the United States workforce exposed to disease or infection at work, this analysis also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they serve.","Baker, Marissa G; Peckham, Trevor K; Seixas, Noah S",PLoS One,371,9

The test performance characteristics of the Accula (Mesa Biotech) SARS-CoV-2 POC test need to be evaluated to inform its optimal use. The aim of this study was to assess the test performance of the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test. The performance of the Accula test was assessed by comparing results of 100 nasopharyngeal swab samples previously characterized by the Stanford Health Care EUA laboratory-developed test (SHC-LDT), targeting the envelope (E) gene. Assay concordance was assessed by overall percent agreement, positive percent agreement (PPA), negative percent agreement (NPA), and Cohen's kappa coefficient. Overall percent agreement between the assays was 84.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75.3 to 90.6%), PPA was 68.0% (95% CI, 53.3 to 80.5%), and the kappa coefficient was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.82). Sixteen specimens detected by the SHC-LDT were not detected by the Accula test and showed low viral load burden, with a median cycle threshold value of 37.7. NPA was 100% (95% CI, 94.2 to 100%). Compared to the SHC-LDT, the Accula SARS-CoV-2 test showed excellent negative agreement. However, positive agreement was low for samples with low viral load. The false-negative rate of the Accula POC test calls for a more thorough evaluation of POC test performance characteristics in clinical settings and for confirmatory testing in individuals with moderate to high pretest probability of SARS-CoV-2 who test negative on Accula.","Hogan, Catherine A; Garamani, Natasha; Lee, Andrew S; Tung, Jack K; Sahoo, Malaya K; Huang, ChunHong; Stevens, Bryan; Zehnder, James; Pinsky, Benjamin A",J. clin. microbiol,371,30

Crude in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the COVID-19 cohort at 65.6% (n = 21/32) versus 36.3% (n = 11/28, p = 0.041). The adjusted hazard ratio over sixty days for COVID-19 patients was 2.81 (95% CI 1.07, 7.35) after adjusting for age, race, ECMO-associated organ failure, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. CONCLUSION: ECMO has a role in severe ARDS associated with COVID-19 but providers should carefully weigh patient factors when utilizing this scarce resource in favor of influenza pneumonia.","Raff, Lauren A; Reid, Trista D; Johnson, Daniel; Raff, Evan J; Schneider, Andrew B; Charles, Anthony G; Gallaher, Jared R",Am. j. surg,371,30

Strategic communication informs, educates and influences. In addressing varied health and development issues, including the challenges involving diseases control, more targeted communication strategies are designed to make optimum use of available resources to achieve the planned results in a given context. Based on research, that is, the community-based study of risk factors and the operational research, communication theories evolved and so did the strategies and practices for result-driven health and development communication. In this article, some approaches have been examined to better understand the role of strategic communication in development and health, including disease control. Information dissemination through 'extension approach', first for agriculture development and later for family planning, adapted and boosted through advertising and marketing frameworks led to wide awareness about the methods and techniques of family planning but not the adoption at the same levels. Experience and research studies demonstrated that mere 'awareness' was not adequate for fostering adoption of 'new' practices;instead, it required sustained investments in communication for social and behavioural change processes. For this, bottom-up communication design, participatory communication with community involvement, evidence-based advocacy and preparedness for risk communication are required for effective communication and health and development. As HIV/AIDS posed an initial challenge for communication scholars earlier in the 1980s, so is the COVID-19 pandemic throwing a major communication challenge today. The article attempts to analyse the approaches and shed light on the role of communication in health and development, especially in the context of health crisis.","Deepak, Gupta Jai P N.; Yadav, J.

Recently, a study has reported that coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, is associated with a decrease in albumin level, an increase in NETosis, blood coagulation, and cytokine level. Here, we present drug-loaded albumin nanoparticles as a therapeutic agent to resolve the clinical outcomes observed in severe SARS-CoV-2 patients. PEGylated nanoparticle albumin-bound (PNAB) was used to promote prolonged bioactivity of steroidal ginsenoside saponins, PNAB-Rg6 and PNAB-Rgx365. Our data indicate that the application of PNAB-steroidal ginsenoside can effectively reduce histone H4 and NETosis-related factors in the plasma, and alleviate SREBP2-mediated systemic inflammation in the PBMCs of SARS-CoV-2 ICU patients. The engineered blood vessel model confirmed that these drugs are effective in suppressing blood clot formation and vascular inflammation. Moreover, the animal model experiment showed that these drugs are effective in promoting the survival rate by alleviating tissue damage and cytokine storm. Altogether, our findings suggest that these PNAB-steroidal ginsenoside drugs have potential applications in the treatment of symptoms associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 patients, such as coagulation and cytokine storm.","Park, Hee Ho; Kim, Hyelim; Lee, Han Sol; Seo, Eun U; Kim, Ji-Eun; Lee, Jee-Hyun; Mun, Yong-Hyeon; Yoo, So-Yeol; An, Jiseon; Yun, Mi-Young; Kang, Nae-Won; Kim, Dae-Duk; Na, Dong Hee; Hong, Kyung Soo; Jang, Jong Geol; Ahn, June Hong; Bae, Jong-Sup; Song, Gyu Yong; Lee, Jae-Young; Kim, Hong Nam; Lee, Wonhwa",Biomaterials,371,24

Surfaces and objects contaminated by saliva or nose secretions represent a risk for indirect transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We assayed surfaces from hospital and living spaces to identify the presence of viral RNA and the spread of fomites in the environment. Anthropic contamination by droplets and biological fluids was monitored by detecting the microbiota signature using multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) on selected species and massive sequencing on 16S amplicons. A total of 92 samples (flocked swabs) were collected from critical areas during the pandemic, including indoor (three hospitals and three public buildings) and outdoor surfaces exposed to anthropic contamination (handles and handrails, playgrounds). Traces of biological fluids were frequently detected in spaces open to the public and on objects that are touched with the hands (>80%). However, viral RNA was not detected in hospital wards or other indoor and outdoor surfaces either in the air system of a COVID hospital but only in the surroundings of an infected patient, in consistent association with droplet traces and fomites. Handled objects accumulated the highest level of multiple contaminations by saliva, nose secretions, and fecal traces, further supporting the priority role of handwashing in prevention. In conclusion, anthropic contamination by droplets and biological fluids is widespread in spaces open to the public and can be traced by qPCR. Monitoring fomites can support evaluation of indirect transmission risks for coronavirus or other flu-like viruses in the environment.IMPORTANCE Several studies have evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. Saliva and nasopharyngeal droplets can land on objects and surfaces, creating fomites. A suitable indicator would allow the detection of droplets or biofluids carrying the virus. Therefore, we searched for viral RNA and droplets and fomites on at risk surfaces. We monitored by qPCR or next generation sequencing (NGS) droplets through their microbiota. Although the study was performed during the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 was not significantly found on surfaces, with the only exception of environmental areas near infectious patients. Conversely, anthropic contamination was frequent, suggesting a role for biofluids as putative markers of indirect transmission and risk assessment. Moreover, all SARS-CoV-2-contaminated surfaces showed droplets' microbiota. Fomite monitoring by qPCR may have an impact on public health strategies, supporting prevention of indirect transmission similarly to what is done for other communicable diseases (e.g., influenza and influenza-like infections).","Piana, Andrea; Colucci, Maria Eugenia; Valeriani, Federica; Marcolongo, Adriano; Sotgiu, Giovanni; Pasquarella, Cesira; Margarucci, Lory Marika; Petrucca, Andrea; Gianfranceschi, Gianluca; Babudieri, Sergio; Vitali, Pietro; D039,; Ermo, Giuseppe; Bizzarro, Assunta; De Maio, Flavio; Vitali, Matteo; Azara, Antonio; Romano, Ferdinando; Simmaco, Maurizio; Romano Spica, Vincenzo",MSphere,371,10

With 17% of the world's population, India has so far had 13% of global COVID-19 infections and 8.5% of deaths. Maharashtra accounting for 9% of India's population, is the worst affected state, with 19% of infections and 33% of total deaths in the country until 23rd December 2020. Though a number of studies have examined the vulnerability to and spread of COVID-19 and its effect on mortality, no attempt has been made to understand its impact on mortality in the states of India. METHOD: Using data from multiple sources and under the assumption that COVID-19 deaths are additional deaths in the population, this paper examined the impact of the disease on premature mortality, loss of life expectancy, years of potential life lost (YPLL), and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) in Maharashtra. Descriptive statistics, a set of abridged life tables, YPLL, and DALY were used in the analysis. Estimates of mortality indices were compared pre- and during COVID-19. RESULT: COVID-19 attributable deaths account for 5.3% of total deaths in the state and have reduced the life expectancy at birth by 0.8 years, from 73.2 years in the pre-COVID-19 period to 72.4 years by the end of 2020. If COVID-19 attributable deaths increase to 10% of total deaths, life expectancy at birth will likely reduce by 1.4 years. The probability of death in 20-64 years of age (the prime working-age group) has increased from 0.15 to 0.16 due to COVID-19. There has been 1.06 million additional loss of years (YPLL) in the state, and DALY due to COVID-19 has been estimated to be 6 per thousand. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has increased premature mortality, YPLL, and DALY and has reduced life expectancy at every age in Maharashtra.","Vasishtha, Guru; Mohanty, Sanjay K; Mishra, Udaya S; Dubey, Manisha; Sahoo, Umakanta",BMC Infect Dis,371,5

However, to date, the underlying mechanisms of immunomodulatory effects of PM remain unclear. Our objective was to explore how exposure to relatively low doses of urban air PM alters innate responses to bacterial and viral stimuli in vitro. We used secondary alveolar epithelial cell line along with monocyte-derived macrophages to replicate innate lung barrier in vitro. Co-cultured cells were first exposed for 24 h to PM2.5-1 (particle aerodynamic diameter between 1 and 2.5 µm) and subsequently for an additional 24 h to lipopolysaccharide (TLR4), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (TLR3), and synthetic single-stranded RNA oligoribonucleotides (TLR7/8) to mimic bacterial or viral stimulation. Toxicological endpoints included pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-&#945;), cellular metabolic activity, and cell cycle phase distribution. We show that cells exposed to PM2.5-1 produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines following stimulation with bacterial TLR4 ligand than cells exposed to PM2.5-1 or bacterial ligand alone. On the contrary, PM2.5-1 exposure reduced pro-inflammatory responses to viral ligands TLR3 and TLR7/8. Cell cycle analysis indicated that viral ligands induced cell cycle arrest at the G2-M phase. In PM-primed co-cultures, however, they failed to induce the G2-M phase arrest. Contrarily, bacterial stimulation caused a slight increase in cells in the sub-G1 phase but in PM2.5-1 primed co-cultures the effect of bacterial stimulation was masked by PM2.5-1. These findings indicate that PM2.5-1 may alter responses of immune defense differently against bacterial and viral infections. Further studies are required to explain the mechanism of immune modulation caused by PM in altering the susceptibility to respiratory infections.","Shahbaz, Muhammad Ali; Martikainen, Maria-Viola; Rönkkö, Teemu J; Komppula, Mika; Jalava, Pasi I; Roponen, Marjut",Environ Res,371,10

Few COVID-19 therapeutics are available, and the basis for severe infections is poorly understood. Here, we investigated properties of type I (ß), II (Î³), and III (&#955;1) interferons (IFNs), potent immune cytokines that are normally produced during infection and that upregulate IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) effectors to limit virus replication. IFNs are already in clinical trials to treat COVID-19. However, recent studies highlight the potential for IFNs to enhance expression of host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), suggesting that IFN therapy or natural coinfections could exacerbate COVID-19 by upregulating this critical virus entry receptor. Using a cell line model, we found that beta interferon (IFN-ß) strongly upregulated expression of canonical antiviral ISGs, as well as ACE2 at the mRNA and cell surface protein levels. Strikingly, IFN-&#955;1 upregulated antiviral ISGs, but ACE2 mRNA was only marginally elevated and did not lead to detectably increased ACE2 protein at the cell surface. IFN-Î³ induced the weakest ISG response but clearly enhanced surface expression of ACE2. Importantly, all IFN types inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner, and IFN-ß and IFN-&#955;1 exhibited potent antiviral activity in primary human bronchial epithelial cells. Our data imply that type-specific mechanisms or kinetics shape IFN-enhanced ACE2 transcript and cell surface levels but that the antiviral action of IFNs against SARS-CoV-2 counterbalances any proviral effects of ACE2 induction. These insights should aid in evaluating the benefits of specific IFNs, particularly IFN-&#955;, as repurposed therapeutics.IMPORTANCE Repurposing existing, clinically approved, antiviral drugs as COVID-19 therapeutics is a rapid way to help combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Interferons (IFNs) usually form part of the body's natural innate immune defenses against viruses, and they have been used with partial success to treat previous new viral threats, such as HIV, hepatitis C virus, and Ebola virus. Nevertheless, IFNs can have undesirable side effects, and recent reports indicate that IFNs upregulate the expression of host ACE2 (a critical entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2), raising the possibility that IFN treatments could exacerbate COVID-19. Here, we studied the antiviral- and ACE2-inducing properties of different IFN types in both a human lung cell line model and primary human bronchial epithelial cells. We observed differences between IFNs with respect to their induction of antiviral genes and abilities to enhance the cell surface expression of ACE2. Nevertheless, all the IFNs limited SARS-CoV-2 replication, suggesting that their antiviral actions can counterbalance increased ACE2.","Busnadiego, Idoia; Fernbach, Sonja; Pohl, Marie O; Karakus, Umut; Huber, Michael; Trkola, Alexandra; Stertz, Silke; Hale, Benjamin G",mBio (Online),371,5

The majority of patients presenting in early infancy have end-stage renal disease (ESRD). While awaiting the results of sRNAi trials, the current standard treatment is combined liver-kidney transplantation. Recently, Stiripentol has been reported as a promising drug in the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria by reducing urinary oxalate (UOx). Stiripentol is an anti-convulsive drug used in the treatment of children suffering from Dravet syndrome. It causes blockage of the last step in oxalate production by inhibition of hepatic lactate dehydrogenase 5 (LDH5). CASE: We administered Stiripentol as compassionate use in an anuric infant with dialysis-dependent PH1 over a period of 4 months. Although achieving plasma concentrations of Stiripentol that were recently reported to lower UOx excretion, we did not observe significant reduction to plasma oxalate concentrations (POx). CONCLUSION: We conclude that Stiripentol may not be useful to reduce POx in PH patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), but larger studies are needed to confirm this finding.","Kempf, Caroline; Pfau, Anja; Holle, Johannes; Müller-Schlüter, Karen; Bufler, Philip; Knauf, Felix; Müller, Dominik",Pediatr. nephrol,371,31

However, the precise factors that affect anxiety and depression in this population require further evaluation. This study aimed to explore factors associated with anxiety and depression among nurses fighting COVID-19 in China. We used convenience sampling to recruit 282 nurses fighting COVID-19 in three hospitals. Participants were questioned about demographic characteristics, daily working time, daily sleep duration, sleep quality, anxiety, depression, resilience, and coping styles. Linear regression analysis indicated that resilience (ß = -0.217, P < 0.001), positive coping style (ß = -0.281, P < 0.001), negative coping style (ß = 0.395, P < 0.001), and sleep quality (ß = 0.153, P = 0.010) were predictive factors for anxiety, and the model explained 44.20% (P < 0.001) of variability. Resilience (ß = -0.239, P < 0.001), positive coping style (ß = -0.222, P < 0.001), negative coping style (ß = 0.152, P < 0.001), and sleep quality (ß = 0.104, P = 0.003) were identified as explanatory factors for depression, and the model explained 34.50% (P < 0.001) of variability.

An online survey was administered from May 22 to June 5, 2020 using a questionnaire comprising of sociodemographic information, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and the Coping Strategies Inventory. Participants comprised 3,000 people from Brazil's 26 states and the Federal District, with an average age of 39.8 years, women (83%), married (50.6%), graduates (70.1%) and employees (46.7%). Some contracted the virus (6.4%) and had dead friends or relatives (22.7%). There was more consumption of drugs, tobacco, medication, and food (40.8%). Almost half of participants expressed symptoms of depression (46.4%), anxiety (39.7%), and stress (42.2%). These were higher in women, people without children, students, patients with chronic diseases, and people who had contact with others diagnosed with COVID-19. The existence of a group more vulnerable to situations with a high stress burden requires greater attention regarding mental health during and after the pandemic.

METHODS: Of the 7,334 women who underwent the OGTT between 22 and 30 weeks gestation, 966 had HIP (WHO diagnostic criteria, reference standard). The 467 women who had an available HbA1c were used for analysis. French-speaking Society of Diabetes (SFD) proposal to diagnose HIP during COVID-19 pandemic was retrospectively applied: HbA1c &#8805;5.7% (39 mmol/mol) and/or FPG level &#8805;5.1 mmol/l.

RESULTS: The sensitivity was 57% [95% confidence interval 52-62]. FN women had globally lower plasma glucose levels during OGTT, lower HbA1c and body mass index than those TP. The percentage of HIP-related events was similar in FN (who were cared) and TP cases, respectively 19.5 and 16.9% (p = 0.48). We observed similar results when women at high risk for HIP only were considered. CONCLUSION: The SFD proposal has a poor sensitivity to detect HIP.

Gammacoronaviruses continue to be reported in an increasing number of avian species, generally by detection of viral RNA. Apart from infectious bronchitis virus in chickens, the only avian species in which CoV has been definitively associated with disease are the turkey, pheasant and guinea fowl. Whilst there is strong evidence for recombination between gammacoronaviruses of different avian species, and between betacoronaviruses in different mammals, evidence of recombination between coronaviruses of different genera is lacking. Furthermore, the recombination of an alpha or betacoronavirus with a gammacoronavirus is extremely unlikely.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective serological study between July and August 2020 on all residents and staff members of three homeless shelters run by Samusocial of Paris: two centres providing healthcare accommodation (HCA) and one a women's dormitory. We included all adults present in the shelters or who died of a proven SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first wave (March-May). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in serum samples using the SARS-CoV-2 IgG Architect (Abbott) test. Any participant with a positive PCR or serology was defined as a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case. RESULTS: We included 100 residents and 83 staff members. The confirmed SARS-CoV-2 rate by PCR or serology was 72/100 (72.0%) for residents and 17/83 (20.5%) for staff members. Women accommodated in the dormitory had the highest infection rate (90.6%). The hospitalization rate in residents was 17/72 (23.6%) and the death rate 4/72 (5.6%).

These two dimensions of demands and resources thus counterbalance each other and define the level of work commitment and finally its consequences in terms of performance. In the context of telework, which was the rule during the period of containment due to the COVID crisis, our qualitative field survey (involving more than 80 people) revealed numerous human risks such as demotivation, difficulties in resting on clear work instructions or a loss of meaning at middle management level had a direct effect on human reliability (Dhillon, 2013) and generally on work engagement. The problem is that the risk of a decline in work commitment is not something visible to the organization. We therefore propose to combine the JD-R model with the Bow-Tie method (Khakzad et al., 2012).

However, the data about the possible role of cholesterol carrying lipoproteins and their receptors in relation to infection are scarce and the connection of lipid-associated pathologies with COVID-19 disease is in its infancy. Herein we provide an overview of lipids and lipid metabolism in relation to COVID-19, with special attention on different forms of cholesterol. Cholesterol enriched lipid rafts represent a platform for viruses to enter the host cell by endocytosis. Generally, higher membrane cholesterol coincides with higher efficiency of COVID-19 entry. Inversely, patients with COVID-19 show lowered levels of blood cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and low-density lipoproteins. The modulated efficiency of viral entry can be explained by availability of SR-B1 receptor. HDL seems to have a variety of roles, from being itself a scavenger for viruses, an immune modulator and mediator of viral entry. Due to inverse roles of membrane cholesterol and lipoprotein cholesterol in COVID-19 infected patients, treatment of these patients with cholesterol lowering statins needs more attention. In conclusion, cholesterol and lipoproteins are potential markers for monitoring the viral infection status, while the lipid metabolic pathways and the composition of membranes could be targeted to selectively inhibit the life cycle of the virus as a basis for antiviral therapy.","Kocar, Eva; Rezen, Tadeja; Rozman, Damjana",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Biol Lipids,371,20

India's multipronged response included nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs) like intensive case-based surveillance, expanding testing capacity, social distancing, health promotion, and progressive travel restrictions leading to a complete halt of international and domestic movements (lockdown). Objectives: We studied the impact of NPI on transmission dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic in India and estimated the minimum level of herd immunity required to halt it. Methods: We plotted time distribution, estimated basic (R0) and time-dependent effective (Rt) reproduction numbers using software R, and calculated doubling time, the growth rate for confirmed cases from January 30 to May 4, 2020. Herd immunity was estimated using the latest Rtvalue. Results: Time distribution showed a propagated epidemic with subexponential growth. Average growth rate, 21% in the beginning, reduced to 6% after an extended lockdown (May 3). Based on early transmission dynamics, R0was 2.38 (95% confidence interval [CI] =1.79-3.07). Early, unmitigated Rt= 2.51 (95% CI = 2.05-3.14) (March 15) reduced to 1.28 (95% CI = 1.22-1.32) and was 1.83 (95% CI = 1.71-1.93) at the end of lockdown Phase 1 (April 14) and 2 (May 3), respectively. Similarly, average early doubling time (4.3 days) (standard deviation [SD] = 1.86) increased to 5.4 days (SD = 1.03) and 10.9 days (SD = 2.19). Estimated minimum 621 million recoveries are required to halt COVID-19 spread if Rtremains below 2. Conclusion: India's early response, especially stringent lockdown, has slowed COVID-19 epidemic. Increased testing, intensive case-based surveillance and containment efforts, modulated movement restrictions while protecting the vulnerable population, and continuous monitoring of transmission dynamics should be a way forward in the absence of effective treatment, vaccine, and undetermined postinfection immunity.","Patel, Purvi; Athotra, Aditya; Vaisakh, T P; Dikid, Tanzin; Jain, Sudhir Kumar",Indian J Public Health,371,11

The impact of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) on the severity of COVID-19 illness is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether ICI confers an additional risk for severe COVID-19 in patients with cancer. METHODS: We analyzed data from 110 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 while on treatment with ICI without chemotherapy in 19 hospitals in North America, Europe and Australia. The primary objective was to describe the clinical course and to identify factors associated with hospital and intensive care (ICU) admission and mortality. FINDINGS: Thirty-five (32%) patients were admitted to hospital and 18 (16%) died. All patients who died had advanced cancer, and only four were admitted to ICU. COVID-19 was the primary cause of death in 8 (7%) patients. Factors independently associated with an increased risk for hospital admission were ECOG &#8805;2 (OR 39.25, 95% CI 4.17 to 369.2, p=0.0013), treatment with combination ICI (OR 5.68, 95% CI 1.58 to 20.36, p=0.0273) and presence of COVID-19 symptoms (OR 5.30, 95% CI 1.57 to 17.89, p=0.0073). Seventy-six (73%) patients interrupted ICI due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, 43 (57%) of whom had resumed at data cut-off. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19-related mortality in the ICI-treated population does not appear to be higher than previously published mortality rates for patients with cancer. Inpatient mortality of patients with cancer treated with ICI was high in comparison with previously reported rates for hospitalized patients with cancer and was due to COVID-19 in almost half of the cases. We identified factors associated with adverse outcomes in ICI-treated patients with COVID-19.","Rogiers, Aljosja; Pires da Silva, Ines; Tentori, Chiara; Tondini, Carlo Alberto; Grimes, Joseph M; Trager, Megan H; Nahm, Sharon; Zubiri, Leyre; Manos, Michael; Bowling, Peter; Elkrief, Arielle; Papneja, Neha; Vitale, Maria Grazia; Rose, April A N; Borgers, Jessica S W; Roy, Severine; Mangana, Joanna; Pimentel Muniz, Thiago; Cooksley, Tim; Lupu, Jeremy; Vaisman, Alon; Saibil, Samuel D; Butler, Marcus O; Menzies, Alexander M; Carlino, Matteo S; Erdmann, Michael; Berking, Carola; Zimmer, Lisa; Schadendorf, Dirk; Pala, Laura; Queirolo, Paola; Posch, Christian; Hauschild, Axel; Dummer, Reinhard; Haanen, John; Blank, Christian U; Robert, Caroline; Sullivan, Ryan J; Ascierto, Paolo Antonio; Miller, Wilson H; Stephen Hodi, F; Suijkerbuijk, Karijn P M; Reynolds, Kerry L; Rahma, Osama E; Lorigan, Paul C; Carvajal, Richard D; Lo, Serigne; Mandala, Mario; Long, Georgina V",J. immunotherap. cancer,371,1

The objective of our study was to determine the misdiagnosis rate of radiologists for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluate the performance of chest CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. The CT features of COVID-19 are reported and compared with the CT features of other viruses to familiarize radiologists with possible CT patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This study included the first 51 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing (23 women and 28 men; age range, 26-83 years) and two patients with adenovirus (one woman and one man; ages, 58 and 66 years). We reviewed the clinical information, CT images, and corresponding image reports of these 53 patients. The CT images included images from 99 chest CT examinations, including initial and follow-up CT studies. We compared the image reports of the initial CT study with the laboratory test results and identified CT patterns suggestive of viral infection. RESULTS. COVID-19 was misdiagnosed as a common infection at the initial CT study in two inpatients with underlying disease and COVID-19. Viral pneumonia was correctly diagnosed at the initial CT study in the remaining 49 patients with COVID-19 and two patients with adenovirus. These patients were isolated and obtained treatment. Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation with or without vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening, and air bronchogram sign are common CT features of COVID-19. The The ""reversed halo"" sign and pulmonary nodules with a halo sign are uncommon CT features. The CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT findings of adenovirus infection. There are differences as well as similarities in the CT features of COVID-19 compared with those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome. CONCLUSION. We found that chest CT had a low rate of missed diagnosis of COVID-19 (3.9%, 2/51) and may be useful as a standard method for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to optimize the management of patients. However, CT is still limited for identifying specific viruses and distinguishing between viruses.","Li, Yan; Xia, Liming",AJR Am J Roentgenol,371,1

Yet, the quality of current research may be challenged by the urgent need to provide immediate results to understand and alleviate the consequences of the pandemic. This study aims to examine compliance with basic methodological quality criteria and open scientific research practices on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method and results: Twenty-eight studies were identified through a systematic search. Most of them met the requirements related to reporting key methodological and statistical information. However, the widespread use of convenience samples and the lack of a priori power analysis, coupled with low compliance with open science recommendations, such as pre-registration of studies and availability of databases, raise concerns about the validity, generalisability, and reproducibility of the findings. Conclusions: While the importance of offering rapid evidence-based responses to mitigate mental health problems stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic is undeniable, it should not be done at the expense of sacrificing scientific rigor. The results of this study may stimulate researchers and funding agencies to try to orchestrate efforts and resources and follow standard codes of good scientific practice.","Nieto, Inés; Navas, Juan F.; Vázquez, Carmelo","Brain, Behav., Immun. - Health",371,16

With the exponential increase in the number of cases and necessity to screen large number of people, there is a steep increase in the demand for diagnostic kits. Pooled-sample testing is a promising strategy to screen a large population rapidly with limited resources. The aim of this work was to compile a cohesive literature review of the effectiveness and accuracy of pooled-sample testing in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and critically analyze its limitations. Medline, Google Scholar, Embase, and preprint servers (e.g., bioRxiv) were searched for literature on pooled testing for diagnosis of COVID-19, and out of initial 60 articles/reports, nine original articles were retained. Optimal pool size (number of samples in a pool) seemed to be dependent on factors like prevalence or rate of positivity in community. In low-prevalence localities pool size of around 30 seemed to be effective as observed by some authors. All the researchers had found significant reduction in number of tests (depending on pool size, stages, and pooling design), leading to conservation of resources. Pooling can be done with extracted RNA eluate or directly with patient's sample before extraction. This leads to further reduction in consumables, time and manpower. Risk of false negativity in samples with high-threshold cycle (i.e., low-viral load) value was a concern. Some researchers suggest adding few additional cycles to lower the chances of missing positive cases with low-Ct value. Lower limit of detection (LoD) of RT-PCR kits, that is, sensitivity of kits was another factor to consider. Thus, in a country like India, given the economic benefit and scarcity of resources, pooling strategy can be very effective, especially in low-prevalence areas and in low-risk contacts.","Deka, Sangeeta; Kalita, Deepjyoti",J Lab Physicians,371,16

This milestone coincides with the pandemic caused by COVID-19, putting in conflict notions of people's rights linked to the preservation of life and freedom presented by ECA itself. This article explores the reinventions and displacements resulting from the quarantine, which attend to people's right to life in a context where restrictions are imposed to their right to freedom. By assuming the inseparability of Michel de Certeau's concepts of 'strategy' and 'tactics', the article methodologically deals with six expressive scenes of a new practice of everyday life, which are linked, each one in its own way, to three specific dimensions: the families' relationship with technologies; the relationship of families with the school; and the relationship between families and their children. The four initial scenes, explored from the configuration of 'strategy', indicate efforts to shape the forms of social organization. In this case, it becomes evident how, on the one hand, the relationship of families with technology, and, on the other, the relationship of families with school, suggest practices that are committed to maintain ways of existence, even in the midst of a context of exceptionality. The last two scenes are based on the 'tactic' configuration and give visibility to everyday practices of families with children, which we view as ordinary people's reports that, through this very condition, suggest creative possibilities.","Guizzo, Bianca Salazar; Marcello, Fabiana de Amorim; Müller, Fernanda",Educ.

This has been affected by COVID-19, as conducting education on a distance basis has revealed the need to examine the perceptions of people about distance education. The perceptions of academicians about distance education are also highly important, as they directly affect the learning success and performance of students. In this study, metaphors were addressed in order to determine the perceptions of academicians in Turkey about distance education.

Due to the time-consuming process of drug discovery, physicians have used readily available drugs and therapies for treatment of infections to minimize the death toll. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to provide a snapshot analysis of the major drugs used in a cohort of 1562 Pakistani patients during the period from May to July 2020, when the first wave of COVID-19 peaked in Pakistan. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed to provide an overview of the major drugs used in a cohort of 1562 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the four major tertiary-care hospitals in the Rawalpindi-Islamabad region of Pakistan during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 in the country (May-July 2020). RESULTS: Antibiotics were the most common choice out of all the therapies employed, and they were used as first line of treatment for COVID-19. Azithromycin was the most prescribed drug for treatment. No monthly trend was observed in the choice of antibiotics, and these drugs appeared to be a random but favored choice throughout the months of the study. It was also noted that even antibiotics used for multidrug resistant infections were prescribed irrespective of the severity or progression of the infection. The results of the analysis are alarming, as this approach may lead to antibiotic resistance and complications in immunocompromised patients with COVID-19. A total of 1562 patients (1064 male, 68.1%, and 498 female, 31.9%) with a mean age of 47.35 years (SD 17.03) were included in the study. The highest frequency of patient hospitalizations occurred in June (846/1562, 54.2%).

Prior works however generally operate with the assumption that there is a limited number of styles, most of which have already been captured by existing datasets. In this paper, we take a completely different perspective -- we work on the assumption that there is always a new style that is drastically different, and that we will only have very limited data during testing to perform adaptation. This results in a commercially viable solution -- the model has the best shot at adaptation being exposed to the new style, and the few samples nature makes it practical to implement. We achieve this via a novel meta-learning framework which exploits additional new-writer data through a support set, and outputs a writer-adapted model via single gradient step update, all during inference. We discover and leverage on the important insight that there exists few key characters per writer that exhibit relatively larger style discrepancies. For that, we additionally propose to meta-learn instance specific weights for a character-wise cross-entropy loss, which is specifically designed to work with the sequential nature of text data. Our writer-adaptive MetaHTR framework can be easily implemented on the top of most state-of-the-art HTR models. Experiments show an average performance gain of 5-7% can be obtained by observing very few new style data. We further demonstrate via a set of ablative studies the advantage of our meta design when compared with alternative adaption mechanisms.","Bhunia, Ayan Kumar; Ghose, Shuvozit; Kumar, Amandeep; Chowdhury, Pinaki Nath; Sain, Aneeshan; Song, Yi-Zhe",,371,24

Tremendous efforts and resources have been invested in developing diagnosis, prognosis and treatment strategies to combat the disease. Although nucleic acid detection has been mainly used as the gold standard to confirm this RNA virus-based disease, it has been shown that such a strategy has a high false negative rate, especially for patients in the early stage, and thus CT imaging has been applied as a major diagnostic modality in confirming positive COVID-19. Despite the various, urgent advances in developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer-aided systems for CT-based COVID-19 diagnosis, most of the existing methods can only perform classification, whereas the state-of-the-art segmentation method requires a high level of human intervention. In this paper, we propose a fully-automatic, rapid, accurate, and machine-agnostic method that can segment and quantify the infection regions on CT scans from different sources. Our method is founded upon two innovations: 1) the first CT scan simulator for COVID-19, by fitting the dynamic change of real patients' data measured at different time points, which greatly alleviates the data scarcity issue; and 2) a novel deep learning algorithm to solve the large-scene-small-object problem, which decomposes the 3D segmentation problem into three 2D ones, and thus reduces the model complexity by an order of magnitude and, at the same time, significantly improves the segmentation accuracy. Comprehensive experimental results over multi-country, multi-hospital, and multi-machine datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method over the existing ones and suggest its important application value in combating the disease.","Zhou, Longxi; Li, Zhongxiao; Zhou, Juexiao; Li, Haoyang; Chen, Yupeng; Huang, Yuxin; Xie, Dexuan; Zhao, Lintao; Fan, Ming; Hashmi, Shahrukh; Abdelkareem, Faisal; Eiada, Riham; Xiao, Xigang; Li, Lihua; Qiu, Zhaowen; Gao, Xin",IEEE Trans Med Imaging,371,24

Current protocols for FAPs identification and isolation use flow cytometry/fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and studies evaluating their function in vivo to date have been undertaken exclusively in mice. The larger inherent size of the rat allows for a more comprehensive analysis of FAPs in skeletal muscle injury models, especially in severely atrophic muscle or when investigators require substantial tissue mass to conduct multiple downstream assays. The rat additionally provides a larger selection of muscle functional assays that do not require animal sedation or sacrifice, thus minimizing morbidity and animal use by enabling serial assessments. The flow cytometry/FACS protocols optimized for mice are species specific, notably restricted by the characteristics of commercially available antibodies. They have not been optimized for separating FAPs from rat or highly fibrotic muscle. A flow cytometry/FACS protocol for the identification and isolation of FAPs and MPs from both healthy and denervated rat skeletal muscle was developed, relying on the differential expression of surface markers CD31, CD45, Sca-1, and VCAM-1. As rat-specific, flow cytometry-validated primary antibodies are severely limited, in-house conjugation of the antibody targeting Sca-1 was performed. Using this protocol, successful Sca-1 conjugation was confirmed, and flow cytometric identification of FAPs and MPs was validated by cell culture and immunostaining of FACS-isolated FAPs and MPs. Finally, we report a novel FAPs time-course in a prolonged (14 week) rat denervation model. This method provides the investigators the ability to study FAPs in a novel animal model.","Te, Lucas Jaryd Iringan; Doherty, Christina; Correa, Judy; Batt, Jane",J. vis. exp,371,10

DESIGN: Exploratory study. SUBJECTS: Dutch children (age 5-19 years) with spina bifida who use a manual wheelchair. METHODS: For the dependent variable physical activity, data from 2 physical activity monitors were analysed: VitaMove data for 34 participants and Actiheart data for 36 participants. Time sedentary, time physically active, and time in moderate to vigorous physical activity were analysed. The Wheelchair Shuttle Test was used to measure VO2peak. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed. Independent variables were VO2peak, age, sex, and Hoffer classification. RESULTS: Time sedentary and time physically active during a school day were influenced by age (ß=0.326/ß=-0.320) and Hoffer classification (ß=0.409/ß=-0.534) and during a weekend day by Hoffer classification (ß=0.617/ß=-0.428). Time in moderate to vigorous physical activity was influenced by Hoffer classification (ß=-0.527) during a school day and by age (ß=-0.600) during a weekend day.

Here, we report our experience of a successful endobronchial occlusion using endobronchial Watanabe spigots (EWSs) for empyema with broncho-pleural fistula secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. A 62-year-old man was diagnosed with COVID-19 and progressed to empyema with broncho-pleural fistula. Computed tomography (CT) imaging showed cyst formation and the right B5b was presumed to be a branch dependent on the cyst. The effusion and air in the pleural cavity were well drained, although the air leak persisted. Endobronchial occlusion was performed for right B5a and B5b using 7- and 5-mm EWSs (Novatech, France), respectively, and the air leak ceased. This is the first report of successful treatment of empyema with bronchial fistula with endobronchial occlusion. Air leak secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia with a limited number of air cysts may be a good indication for endobronchial occlusion.","Nakano, Takahito Kawada Masahiro Minami Kensuke Kaneda Hiroyuki",Respirology Case Reports,371,21

METHODS: Visit outcome and patient demographic data were obtained via electronic health record (EHR) reports. Telehealth visit completion rates were compared by patient characteristics using the chi-square test and t-test. We used zip code data to generate latitude- and longitude-based maps of the range and density of service delivery. Patient cases highlighting challenges and opportunities for adolescent telehealth were summarized. RESULTS: Between March 16 and April 15, 2020, 392 telehealth visits were scheduled in 331 unique patients, with an 82% appointment completion rate. Video visits were conducted for eating disorders (39%), contraception/menstrual disorders (22%), gender-affirming care (17%), general adolescent medicine (15%), HIV treatment (6%), and substance abuse (1%). The majority of telehealth patients were female Caucasian minors with private insurance. There were no significant differences in telehealth visit completion rates by age, sex, gender, or insurance. Patients coded as non-white (African-American, Asian, or other) in the EHR had lower visit completion rates than white patients (p = .003). Telehealth patients were distributed across five states, with the highest concentration in the zip codes nearest to the clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid scale-up of telehealth for Adolescent Medicine was achieved at this large academic medical center. Future implementation research is needed to assure telehealth reaches adolescents without widening health disparities.","Wood, Sarah M; White, Krishna; Peebles, Rebecka; Pickel, Julia; Alausa, Maryam; Mehringer, Jamie; Dowshen, Nadia",J Adolesc Health,371,16

The models that can accurately resemble human-relevant responses to viral infection are lacking. Here, we create a biomimetic human disease model on chip that allows to recapitulate lung injury and immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 in vitro at organ level. This human alveolar chip reproduced the key features of alveolar-capillary barrier by co-culture of human alveolar epithelium, microvascular endothelium and circulating immune cells under fluidic flow in normal and disease. Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, the epithelium exhibited higher susceptibility to virus than endothelium. Transcriptional analyses showed activated innate immune responses in epithelium and cytokine-dependent pathways in endothelium at 3 days post-infection, revealing the distinctive responses in different cell types. Notably, viral infection caused the immune cell recruitment, endothelium detachment, and increased inflammatory cytokines release, suggesting the crucial role of immune cells involving in alveolar barrier injury and exacerbated inflammation. Treatment with remdesivir could inhibit viral replication and alleviate barrier disruption on chip. This organ chip model can closely mirror human-relevant responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is difficult to be achieved by in vitro models, providing a unique platform for COVID-19 research and drug development.

Partial face occlusion has become an issue due to the mandatory use of face masks. Also, the use of mobile devices has exploded, with the pandemic further accelerating the migration to digital services. However, state-of-the-art solutions in related tasks such as identity or expression recognition employ large Convolutional Neural Networks, whose use in mobile devices is infeasible due to hardware limitations and size restrictions of downloadable applications. To counteract this, we adapt two existing lightweight CNNs proposed in the context of the ImageNet Challenge, and two additional architectures proposed for mobile face recognition. Since datasets for soft-biometrics prediction using selfie images are limited, we counteract over-fitting by using networks pre-trained on ImageNet. Furthermore, some networks are further pre-trained for face recognition, for which very large training databases are available. Since both tasks employ similar input data, we hypothesize that such strategy can be beneficial for soft-biometrics estimation. A comprehensive study of the effects of different pre-training over the employed architectures is carried out, showing that, in most cases, a better accuracy is obtained after the networks have been fine-tuned for face recognition.","Alonso-Fernandez, Fernando; Diaz, Kevin Hernandez; Ramis, Silvia; Perales, Francisco J.; Bigun, Josef",,371,16

Added workload, potential breaching of patient confidentiality and lack of full documentation of consultations were the main concerns among physicians using the application. 60.7 % of PCPs and 95.7 % of specialists stated that these consultations have reduced the need for in-person appointments at least once a week. CONCLUSIONS: In times of COVID-19 that require social distancing, WhatsApp provides a simple, readily available platform for consultations between healthcare providers, even to the extent of rendering some in-person appointments unnecessary. Healthcare organizations should address the matters troubling healthcare providers, mainly patient confidentiality and lack of documentation in patients' medical records, while providing adequate compensation for those providing the service during and after work hours.","Barayev, Edward; Shental, Omri; Yaari, Dotan; Zloczower, Elchanan; Shemesh, Itai; Shapiro, Michael; Glassberg, Elon; Magnezi, Racheli",Isr J Health Policy Res,371,6

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of patients receiving urgent care at a university center for dental medicine (Basel, Switzerland) during the 6-week lockdown, pre-lockdown, and post-lockdown periods were retrospectively evaluated. Statistical analysis involved tests for equal proportions and logistic regression models. The level of significance was set at &#945;=0.05. RESULTS: The study comprised 3109 dental emergency visits in the period from February 2 to June 5, 2020. Daily caseloads increased during lockdown. Abscesses, orthodontic emergencies, and surgical follow-ups were more common during lockdown, whereas the number of dento-alveolar injuries declined (&#8804;0.048). Urgent dental care provision involved intraoral radiographs more frequently in the pre-lockdown period compared with the following weeks (p<0.001). Among all treatments, aerosol-generating procedures dropped from 56.1% (pre-lockdown) to 21.3% during lockdown (p<0.001), while teledentistry follow-ups became more frequent (p<0.001). Patients with comorbidities sought urgent dental care less frequently during the post-lockdown period (p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown significantly impacted the dental emergency service in terms of patients' diagnoses, treatment needs, and the characteristics of the urgent care that was delivered. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Access to essential dental care must be monitored and safeguarded throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond as deferred care entails risks for serious sequelae and persons with comorbidities may change their dental care-seeking behavior.","Eggmann, Florin; Haschemi, Asin Ahmad; Doukoudis, Dimitrios; Filippi, Andreas; Verna, Carlalberta; Walter, Clemens; Weiger, Roland; Zitzmann, Nicola U; Bornstein, Michael M",Clin. oral investig,371,16

Methods: this is an ecological study with data from confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported between March 21, 2020 and May 3, 2020 in Ponta Grossa and proportion of severity, hospitalization and lethality in the literature. A susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model was developed, and reproduction rate (R0), duration of epidemic, peak period, number of cases, hospitalized patients and deaths were estimated. Deaths were calculated by age group and in three scenarios: at day 24, at day 34, and at day 44 of the epidemic. Results: in the three scenarios assessed in this study, the variation in the number of cases was explained by an exponential curve (r2=0.74, 0.79 and 0.89, respectively, p&lt;0.0001 in all scenarios). The SIR model estimated that, in the best scenario, the peak period will be around 120 days after the first case (between July 11, 2020 and July 25, 2020), estimated R0 will be 1.07 and will infect 0.23% of the population. In the worst scenario, peak period will involve 4,375 (95% CI; 4156-4594) cases and 825 (95% CI; 700-950) cases in the best scenario. Most cases and hospital admissions will involve patients aged 20 to 39 years, the number of deaths will be higher among the elderly and more pronounced among patients aged &#8805;80 years. Conclusion: this is the first study that provides COVID-19 projections for a municipality that is not a large capital. It shows a peak period at a later moment; therefore, the municipality will have more time to prepare and adopt protective measures to reduce the number of simultaneous cases.","Martins, Camila Marinelli; Gomes, Ricardo Zanetti; Muller, Erildo Vicente; Borges, Pollyanna Kassia de Oliveira; Coradassi, Carlos Eduardo; Montiel, Eduarda Mirela da Silva",Texto &amp; contexto enferm,371,16

Methods: A convenience sample of young adults ages 21-28 (n = 29) were recruited online May-July 2020 to participate in semi-structured interviews about nicotine use behaviors specific to cigarillos and e-cigarettes. Audio-recorded interviews were 60-90 min long and were conducted remotely. Participants were asked opinions and behavioral effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on tobacco use. Verbatim transcripts and field notes from each interview were coded by a trained researcher using a codebook developed using inductive and deductive approaches. Thematic analysis was used to examine product access, use frequency, stress and use triggers. Results: Most current users reported tobacco use stayed the same or increased since the pandemic and attributed this to being home more with greater time/boredom. COVID-19 impacted purchasing behaviors such as purchasing products in greater quantities, through the Internet, or at a different store due to perceived cleanliness. Few reported using tobacco products less frequently and not smoking in public due to the perception of risks associated with smoking and COVID-19, plus having to take off their mask to smoke. Lack of social use modified shared product use, flavors selected, and setting of use. Financial impacts included increased product costs and job loss. Few mentioned wanting to quit due to the pandemic. Discussion: Current tobacco users have experienced major changes in their tobacco use routines during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Klein, Elizabeth G; Koopman Gonzalez, Sarah; Pike Moore, Stephanie; Bohnert, Eli J; Quisenberry, Amanda J; Trapl, Erika S",Subst Use Misuse,371,24

However, predictors of outcome in patients who are critically ill are unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a multicentre analysis of 171 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between 1 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 and were followed until 23 May 2020. Demographic data, past medical history, laboratory values, echocardiographic and telemetry data were analysed. Patient status was classified as either alive or deceased at hospital discharge or the end of follow-up period. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 66±13 and 57% were male. Mortality rate of this ICU cohort at the end of follow-up was 46.2%. A multivariable logistic regression analysis identified the presence or history of atrial fibrillation (Odds Ratio 4.8, p=0.004) as a significant cardiovascular attribute that contributed to increased mortality. CONCLUSION: Mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients is high. This study suggests a relationship between atrial fibrillation and increased mortality from COVID-19.

We describe children seeking SARS-CoV-2 testing at a community site and compare antigen test performance to real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and viral culture. MethodsTwo anterior nasal specimens were self-collected for BinaxNOW antigen and RT-PCR testing, along with demographics, symptoms, and exposure information from individuals [≥]5 years at a community testing site. Viral culture was attempted on residual antigen or RT-PCR positive specimens. Demographic and clinical characteristics, and the performance of SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests, were compared among children (<18 years) and adults. ResultsAbout one in ten included specimens were from children (225/2110); 16.4% (37/225) were RT-PCR positive. Cycle threshold values were similar among RT-PCR positive specimens from children and adults (22.5 vs 21.3, p=0.46) and among specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic children (22.5 vs 23.2, p=0.39). Sensitivity of antigen test compared to RT-PCR was 73.0% (27/37) among specimens from children and 80.8% (240/297) among specimens from adults; among specimens from children, specificity was 100% (188/188), positive and negative predictive value were 100% (27/27) and 94.9% (188/198) respectively. Virus was isolated from 51.4% (19/37) of RT-PCR positive pediatric specimens; all 19 had positive antigen test results. ConclusionsWith lower sensitivity relative to RT-PCR, antigen tests may not diagnose all positive COVID-19 cases; however, antigen testing identified children with live SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Ford, Laura; Whaley, Melissa J.; Shah, Melisa M.; Salvatore, Phillip P.; Segaloff, Hannah E.; Delaney, Augustina; Currie, Dustin W.; Boyle-Estheimer, Lauren; O039, Michelle; Hegarty,; Morgan, Clint N.; Meece, Jennifer; Ivacic, Lynn; Thornburg, Natalie J.; Tamin, Azaibi; Harcourt, Jennifer L.; Folster, Jennifer M.; Medrzycki, Magdalena; Jain, Shilpi; Wong, Phili; Goffard, Kimberly; Gieryn, Douglas; Kahrs, Juliana; Langolf, Kimberly; Zochert, Tara; Tate, Jacqueline E.; Hsu, Christopher H.; Kirking, Hannah L.",,371,20

To tackle the complexity of COVID-19 expansion on a spatial-temporal scale, this research appropriately analyzed the spatial-temporal heterogeneity at the county-level in Texas. First, the impact factors of COVID-19 are captured on social, economic, and environmental multiple facets, and the communality is extracted through principal component analysis (PCA). Second, this research uses COVID-19 cumulative case as the dependent variable and the common factors as the independent variables. According to the virus prevalence hierarchy, the spatial-temporal disparity is categorized into four quarters in the GWR analysis model. The findings exhibited that GWR models provide higher fitness and more geodata-oriented information than OLS models. In El Paso, Odessa, Midland, Randall, and Potter County areas in Texas, population, hospitalization, and age structures are presented as static, positive influences on COVID-19 cumulative cases, indicating that they should adopt stringent strategies in curbing COVID-19. Winter is the most sensitive season for the virus spread, implying that the last quarter should be paid more attention to preventing the virus and taking precautions.

Though a number of studies were conducted to estimate the in-hospital mortality rate of stroke in Ethiopia, the lack of a nationwide study that determines the overall magnitude of risk factors and in-hospital mortality rate of stroke is an important research gap. Meta-analysis is key to improve the accuracy of estimates through the use of more data sets. Thus, this study was aimed to determine the overall magnitude of risk factors and in-hospital mortality rate of stroke in Ethiopia. METHODS: This study was conducted following the PRISMA checklist. We searched from Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases for studies. Each of the original studies was assessed using a tool for the risk of bias adapted for cross-sectional studies. Data were pooled and a random effect meta-analysis model was fitted to provide the overall magnitude of risk factors and in-hospital mortality rate of stroke. Also, the subgroup analyses were performed to examine how the in-hospital mortality rate varies across different groups of studies. RESULTS: In this study, the overall magnitude of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation among stroke patients were 47% (95%CI: 40-54), 8% (95CI%:6-12), and 10% (95%CI: 5-19), respectively. The overall in-hospital mortality of stroke in Ethiopia was 18% (95%:14-22). The highest magnitude of in-hospital mortality of stroke was observed in SNNPR and the lowest was noted in Tigray region. In addition, the magnitude of the in-hospital mortality rate of stroke was 15.1% (95%CI: 11.3-19.4), and 19.6%(95%CI: 14.1-25.7), among studies published before and after 2016, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our pooled result showed that nearly one-fifth of stroke patients have died during hospitalization. The most common risk factor of stroke among the included studies was hypertension followed by atrial fibrillation and diabetes mellitus. There is a need for a better understanding of the factors associated with high blood pressure, especially in countries with a high risk of stroke.","Alene, Muluneh; Assemie, Moges Agazhe; Yismaw, Leltework; Ketema, Daniel Bekele",BMC Neurol,371,1

These included clinical management of active cases, rapid development of treatment strategies, vaccines computational modelling and statistical tools to name a few. This article presents a mathematical model for a time series prediction and analyzes the impact of the lockdown. Methods: Several existing mathematical models were not able to account for asymptomatic patients, with limited testing capability at onset and no data on serosurveillance. In this study, a new model was used which was developed on lines of susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered (SAIR) to assess the impact of the lockdown and make predictions on its future course. Four parameters were used, namely ß, Î³, Î· and Îµ. ß measures the likelihood of the susceptible person getting infected, and Î³ denotes recovery rate of patients. The ratio ß/Î³ is denoted by R0 (basic reproduction number). Results: The disease spread was reduced due to initial lockdown. An increase in Î³ reflects healthcare and hospital services, medications and protocols put in place. In Delhi, the predictions from the model were corroborated with July and September serosurveys, which showed antibodies in 23.5 and 33 per cent population, respectively. Interpretation & conclusions: The SAIR model has helped understand the disease better. If the model is correct, we may have reached herd immunity with about 380 million people already infected. However, personal protective measures remain crucial. If there was no lockdown, the number of active infections would have peaked at close to 14.7 million, resulted in more than 2.6 million deaths, and the peak would have arrived by June 2020. The number of deaths with the current trends may be less than 0.2 million.","Agrawal, Manindra; Kanitkar, Madhuri; Vidyasagar, M",Indian journal of medical research,371,1

To investigate the discrepancy in state-wise CFRs, datasets on various factors related to demography, socio-economy, public health, and healthcare capacity have been collected to study their association with CFR. METHODS: State-wise COVID-19 data was collected till April 22, 2021. The latest data on the various factors have been collected from reliable sources. Pearson correlation, two-tailed P test, Spearman rank correlation, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) structures have been used to assess the association between various factors and CFR. RESULTS: Life expectancies, prevalence of overweight, COVID-19 test positive rates, and H1N1 fatality rates show a significant positive association with CFR. Human Development Index, per capita GDP, public affairs index, health expenditure per capita, availability of govt. doctors & hospital beds, prevalence of certain diseases, and comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension show insignificant association with CFR. Sex ratio, health expenditure as a percent of GSDP, and availability of govt. hospitals show a significant negative correlation with CFR. CONCLUSION: The study indicates that older people, males of younger age groups, and overweight people are at more fatality risk from COVID-19. Certain diseases and common comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension do not seem to have any significant effect on CFR. States with better COVID-19 testing rates, health expenditure, and healthcare capacity seem to perform better with regard to COVID-19 fatality rates.","Upadhyay, Ashwini Kumar; Shukla, Shreyanshi",Diabetes Metab Syndr,371,1

Using the correlation modeling, the results revealed that some climatic factors, such as the ULR, temperature, and CH4 in the UAE and aerosol index and NO2 in Switzerland have positive lagged correlations with the outburst of COVID-19 by intensifying role within - 9, - 7, and - 2 days. The mitigating role was also observed for ozone/solar radiation and temperature/long-wave radiation in the UAE and Switzerland, respectively. The initial hypotheses of the research have confirmed the correlations between new cases of COVID-19 and ULR and aerosol indices in the UAE and Switzerland. However, the main finding revealed that the climate effects on the COVID-19 outbreak show different roles in the different countries, locating in dissimilar climatic zones. Accordingly, the COVID-19 can be intensified by increases of the ULR and temperature in an arid region, while it can be exactly mitigated by increases of these factors in a temperate area. This finding may be useful for future researches for identifying the essential influencing factors for the mitigating COVID-19 outbreak.","Mansouri Daneshvar, M R; Ebrahimi, M; Sadeghi, A; Mahmoudzadeh, A",Model Earth Syst Environ,371,1

This has led to concerns that some vulnerable groups, including autistic people, may be excluded from services. METHODS: We reviewed policies from 15 European member states, published in March-July 2020, pertaining to (1) access to COVID-19 tests; (2) provisions for treatment, hospitalisation and intensive care units (ICUs); and (3) changes to standard health and social care. In parallel, we analysed survey data on the lived experiences of 1301 autistic people and caregivers. RESULTS: Autistic people experienced significant barriers when accessing COVID-19 services. First, despite being at elevated risk of severe illness due to co-occurring health conditions, there was a lack of accessibility of COVID-19 testing. Second, many COVID-19 outpatient and inpatient treatment services were reported to be inaccessible, predominantly resulting from individual differences in communication needs. Third, ICU triage protocols in many European countries (directly or indirectly) resulted in discriminatory exclusion from lifesaving treatments. Finally, interruptions to standard health and social care left over 70% of autistic people without everyday support. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated existing healthcare inequalities for autistic people, probably contributing to disproportionate increases in morbidity and mortality, mental health and behavioural difficulties, and reduced quality of life. An urgent need exists for policies and guidelines on accessibility of COVID-19 services to be updated to prevent the widespread exclusion of autistic people from services, which represents a violation of international human rights law.","Oakley, Bethany; Tillmann, Julian; Ruigrok, Amber; Baranger, Aurélie; Takow, Christian; Charman, Tony; Jones, Emily; Cusack, James; Doherty, Mary; Violland, Pierre; Wroczynska, Agnieszka; Simonoff, Emily; Buitelaar, Jan K; Gallagher, Louise; Murphy, Declan G M",BMJ Open,371,30

Although many efforts have already been put forward for developing potential vaccines; however, most of them are proved to possess negative consequences. Therefore, in this study, immunoinformatics methods were exploited to design a novel epitope-based subunit vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2, targeting four essential proteins of the virus i.e., spike glycoprotein, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, membrane glycoprotein, and envelope protein. The highly antigenic, non-allergenic, non-toxic, non-human homolog, and 100% conserved (across other isolates from different regions of the world) epitopes were used for constructing the vaccine. In total, fourteen CTL epitopes and eighteen HTL epitopes were used to construct the vaccine. Thereafter, several in silico validations i.e., the molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation (including the RMSF and RMSD studies), and immune simulation studies were also performed which predicted that the designed vaccine should be quite safe, effective, and stable within the biological environment. Finally, in silico cloning and codon adaptation studies were also conducted to design an effective mass production strategy of the vaccine. However, more in vitro and in vivo studies are required on the predicted vaccine to finally validate its safety and efficacy.","Sarkar, Bishajit; Ullah, Md Asad; Araf, Yusha; Rahman, Mohammad Shahedur",Inform Med Unlocked,371,1

OBJECTIVES: To molecularly characterise a novel HRV and determine its prevalence and clinical impact on a predominantly paediatric population. STUDY DESIGN: Nucleotide sequencing was employed to determine the complete HRV-QPM coding sequence. Two novel real-time RT-PCR diagnostic assays were designed and employed to retrospectively screen a well-defined population of 1244 specimen extracts to identify the prevalence of HRV-QPM during 2003. RESULTS: Phylogenetic studies of complete coding sequences defined HRV-QPM as a novel member the genus Rhinovirus residing within the previously described HRV-A2 sub-lineage. Investigation of the relatively short VP1 sequence suggest that the virus is resistant to Pleconaril, setting it apart from the HRV A species. Sixteen additional HRV-QPM strains were detected (1.4% of specimens) often as the sole micro-organism present among infants with suspected bronchiolitis.

METHODS: Thirteen SARS-CoV-2/DENV co-infection cases reported in Midwestern Brazil between April and September of 2020 are described. Information was gathered from hospital medical records regarding the most relevant clinical and laboratory findings, diagnostic process, therapeutic interventions, together with clinician-assessed outcomes and follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 13 cases, seven patients presented Acute Undifferentiated Febrile Syndrome and six had pre-existing co-morbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension and hypopituitarism. Two patients were pregnant. The most common symptoms and clinical signs reported at first evaluation were myalgia, fever and dyspnea. In six cases, the initial diagnosis was dengue fever, which delayed the diagnosis of concomitant infections. The most frequently applied therapeutic interventions were antibiotics and analgesics. In total, four patients were hospitalized. None of them were transferred to the intensive care unit or died. Clinical improvement was verified in all patients after a maximum of 21 days.

In the present study, we identified synthetic peptides including Th1 and a linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitope in the S1 domain and M protein of FIPV. We also identified peptides that strongly induce Th1 activity from those derived from the structural proteins (S, M, and N proteins) of FIPV based on this and previous studies (Satoh et al. [19]). No Th1 epitope-containing peptide was identified in the peptides derived from the S1 domain of type I FIPV. In contrast, 7 Th1 epitope-containing peptides were identified in the S1 domain of type II FIPV, and no linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitope was contained in any of these peptides. Eleven Th1 epitope-containing peptides common to each serotype were identified in the M protein-derived peptides, and 2 peptides (M-11 and M-12) contained the linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitope.

We determined the rate of re-infection, associated factors and mortality during follow up in a cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We analyzed 9,119 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who received serial tests in total of 62 healthcare facilities in United States between December 1, 2019 to November 13, 2020. Re-infection was defined by two positive tests separated by interval of greater than 90 days two after resolution of first infection was confirmed by two or more consecutive negative tests. We performed logistic regression analysis to identify demographic and clinical characteristics associated with re-infection. RESULTS: Re-infection was identified in 0.7% (n=63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5%-0.9%) during follow up of 9,119 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mean period (±standard deviation [SD]) between two positive tests was 116 ± 21 days.

However, to date, there is no epidemiological data regarding anti-SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in Mexico. Therefore, we aimed to determine the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and define the clinical and demographic characteristics associated with seroprevalence. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional serological survey in Ciudad Guadalupe, NL, Mexico. City government employees voluntarily participated during July 2020. Demographic and clinical characteristics were collected at the time of blood sampling to analyze the associated characteristics. IgM/IgG antibodies were determined using a qualitative chemiluminescent immunoassay. Descriptive statistics were used for categorical and continuous variables. Statistical significance was tested using the Chi-squared test, Student’s t-test and the Mann–Whitney. Logistic regression models and the odds ratios (adjusted and unadjusted) were used to estimate the association of demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 3,268 participants included, 193 (5.9%, 95% CI 5.1–6.8) tested positive for IgM/IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Sex, city of residence, and comorbidities did not show any association with having IgM/IgG antibodies.

SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike protein, in particular the receptor binding domain (RBD), to bind human cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry, and thus targeting RBD holds the promise for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, a competitive biopanning strategy of a phage display antibody library was applied to screen blocking antibodies against RBD. High-affinity antibodies were enriched after the first round using a standard panning process in which RBD-His recombinant protein was immobilized as a bait. At the next two rounds, immobilized ACE2-Fc and free RBD-His proteins were mixed with the enriched phage antibodies. Antibodies binding to RBD at epitopes different from ACE2-binding site were captured by the immobilized ACE2-Fc, forming a “sandwich” complex. Only antibodies competed with ACE2 for recognizing RBD at the same or similar epitopes can bind to the free RBD-His in the supernatant and be subsequently separated by the Ni-NTA magnetic beads. Top 1 lead from the competitive biopanning of a synthetic antibody library, Lib AB1, was produced as the full-length IgG1 format. It was proved to competitively block the binding of RBD to ACE2 protein, and potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection of ACE2-overexpressing Hela cells with IC50 values of 12nM. Nevertheless, top 1 lead from the standard biopanning of Lib AB1, can only bind to RBD in vitro but not have the blocking or neutralization activity. Our strategy can efficiently isolate the blocking antibodies of RBD, and it would speed up the discovery of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","Zeng, Xin; Li, Lingfang; Lin, Jing; Li, Xinlei; Liu, Bin; Kong, Yang; Zeng, Shunze; Du, Jianhua; Xiao, Huahong; Zhang, Tao; Zhang, Shelin; Liu, Jianghai",bioRxiv,371,1

METHODS: A longitudinal design with two-repeated measures was used (N = 1202). Follow-up was a month later from the first measurement. Three groups were analyzed: with suicidal ideation history, with suicide attempt history, and without suicidal behavior history. RESULTS: Percentages of college students with high or moderate suicidal risk were alarming (accumulated: 62.23% first measurement, 57.65% second measurement). Multilevel analysis on the three groups showed that suicidal risk diminished from the first measurement to the follow-up, having mental disorder history predicted higher suicidal risk, and negative urgency had the largest increasing effects on suicidal risk which persisted over time.

However, unlike influenza and other viruses, the burden of the disease in patients with asthma has been less evident. Objective: This study aims at a better understanding of the burden of COVID-19 in patients with asthma and the impact of asthma, its related comorbidities, and treatment on the prognosis of COVID-19. Methods: We analyzed clinical data from patients with asthma from January 1st to May 10th, 2020 using big data analytics and artificial intelligence through the SAVANA Manager clinical platform. Results: Out of 71,192 patients with asthma, 1,006 (1.41%) suffered from COVID-19. Compared to asthmatic individuals without COVID-19, patients with asthma and COVID-19 were significantly older (55 vs. 42 years), predominantly female (66% vs. 59%), had higher prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemias, diabetes, and obesity, and smoked more frequently. Contrarily, allergy-related factors such as rhinitis and eczema were less frequent in asthmatic patients with COVID-19 (P < .001). Higher prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and obesity was also confirmed in those patients with asthma and COVID-19 who required hospital admission. The percentage of individuals using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was lower in patients who required hospitalization due to COVID-19, as compared to non-hospitalized patients (48.3% vs. 61.5%; OR: 0.58: 95% CI 0.44-0.77). During the study period, 865 (1.21%) patients with asthma were being treated with biologics. Although these patients showed increased severity and more comorbidities at the ear, nose, and throat (ENT) level, their hospital admission rates due to COVID-19 were relatively low (0.23%). COVID-19 increased inpatient mortality in asthmatic patients (2.29% vs 0.54%; OR 2.29: 95% CI 4.35-6.66). Conclusion: Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases in patients with asthma has been low, although higher than the observed in the general population. Patients with asthma and COVID-19 were older and were at increased risk due to comorbidity-related factors. ICS and biologics are generally safe and may be associated with a protective effect against severe COVID-19 infection.","Izquierdo, J.

The objective of this study was to foster equality and cost-effectiveness in the distribution and sale of masks to all Taiwanese citizens, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: All 6336 special community pharmacies participating in the NHI (National Health Insurance) served as mask-selling sites. Access to masks by citizens was determined and controlled, based on the weekly rationing of the number of purchasable masks per citizen and the last digit of their NHI card number. Masks were available on different weekdays for holders of cards ending with odd and even numbers, except on Sundays, when everyone was eligible to buy a mask. RESULTS: Implementing the program has provided equal access to masks for all citizens across Taiwan. It has stabilized the pricing of masks and mitigated the public’s anxiety of a perceived likely market shortage. CONCLUSION: The community pharmacy-based approach to the distribution of prevention face masks to citizens represents a new and innovative engagement of pharmacists in public health promotion and protection initiatives.

The data were collected using a personal information form, the Beck Anxiety Scale, administered in face‐to‐face interviews, and online questionnaires. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Kruskal–Wallis, Mann–Whitney U, and logistic regression analyses. FINDINGS: The anxiety level of individuals under quarantine (Median: min–max = 1: 0–55) was significantly lower statistically compared to that of the rest of the society (Median: min–max = 6: 0–63) and hospitalized COVID‐19 patients (Median: min–max = 5: 0–42) (p = 0.0001). Female gender, being 61 years of age and older, having psychiatric and chronic illnesses, and experiencing disrupted sleep patterns were determined to be the factors associated with high levels of anxiety.

Geriatric patients, at increased risk of morbidly and mortality from Covid-19 infection, face more challenges with video visit access compared to younger patients due to discomfort with technology and less access to necessary devices and broadband internet. Thus, it is a priority to enhance remote connections between geriatric patients and their providers. Methods The aim of this project was to facilitate the transition to video telemedicine for the geriatric population by creating a well-organized training program for volunteers to guide patients and caregivers to make the conversion from phone to video visits. A 28-page volunteer manual was created that included a structured process for how to call patients, including our three-call model, a walk-through of the video modalities, an algorithm for choosing which modality is best for each patient (Figure 1), and troubleshooting resources. Virtual training sessions oriented volunteers to the process and connected them with the faculty they would work with for the duration of the project. Volunteers provided patients with one-to-one remote guidance, identifying and overcoming barriers, with practice sessions to increase comfort with the technology. Initial volunteer work began in the Michigan Medicine Geriatric Psychiatry Clinic. With expansion of our team to 26 total individuals we also began servicing the Michigan Medicine Geriatric General Medicine Clinics. Quantitatively, we measured the proportion of video visits before and after intervention with the program. Qualitatively, we solicited feedback from providers, patients, and volunteers. Results The GET Access Program volunteers were successful in teaching and converting many visits to video that the schedulers were unable to do on a first pass. Of 95 contacted patients, 80 agreed to participate, and 71 switched from a phone visit to video visit, representing a conversion rate of 88.75% from phone to video visits. During a 10-week evaluation period of the two clinics GET Access serviced, 1942 patients had 2865 visits. Of 59 providers within the clinics studied, 12 providers with the lowest video visit rates received help from GET Access. Averaged over the evaluation period, visits after participation in the program were associated with video format 43% compared to 19.2% for visits prior to participation (adjusted OR 3.38 [95% CI 2.49, 4.59]) and visit by non-participating providers (32.1%, adjusted OR 1.65 [1.31, 2.08]) as shown in Figure 2. Conclusions A program dedicated to personalized virtual technological instruction and practice helped geriatric patients transition from phone to video visits, to provide a platform for stronger connection with their providers. Sustainability of the program beyond the immediate need of it due to Covid-19 was achieved with creation of a robust leadership structure. We are currently working with the telehealth administration at Michigan Medicine to expand GET Access to more clinics at Michigan Medicine. This expansion will allow our program to service more patients at Michigan Medicine, and results of the extension are expected to be available in March 2021.","Pichan, Cayla; Merklen, Cassidy; Anderson, Clare; Min, Lillian; Blazek, Mary",The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry,371,33

Twenty‐one female and 26 male Chinese patients (median age, 13.6 years; interquartile range, 9.9–16.0) were studied. In each subject, high‐resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the thorax and pulmonary function were assessed. All children were asymptomatic and had a normal clinical examination. Mild pulmonary abnormalities were detected on HRCT in 16 (34.0%) subjects, including residual ground‐glass opacification (n = 5), air trapping (n = 8), and a combination of ground‐glass changes and air trapping (n = 3). The need for oxygen supplementation (P = 0.02) and lymphopenia during the course of illness (P = 0.012) were significant risk factors in predicting abnormal HRCT. There were no significant lung function differences between those with and without HRCT abnormalities. Despite complete clinical resolution, a considerable proportion of children affected with SARS had abnormal HRCT findings at 6 months. These abnormalities were more prevalent in those with severe disease. It is important that careful follow‐up be carried out to assess the clinical significance and persistence of such abnormalities.

It is a global pandemic that has claimed the death of 1,536,957 human beings worldwide including 287,842 deaths in the United States as of December 3, 2020. It has become a major threat to the medical community and the entire healthcare system in every part of the world. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the emergency use of Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on December 12, 2020. However, there are concern about the new COVID-19 vaccine safety, efficacy, and immunity after the vaccination. In addition, both coronavirus and COVID-19 vaccine are new at this point and there is no scientific evidence to know whether people who are vaccinated can still carry the COVID 19 pathogens and pass them along to others. Therefore, many people all over the world have an increased interest in consuming more VF for the purpose of maintaining their health and boosting their immune system. Identifying novel antiviral agents for COVID-19 is of critical importance, and VF is an excellent source for drug discovery and therapeutic development. The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that a high intake of vegetables and/or fruits prevents COVID-19 incidence and reduces the mortality rate. To achieve this objective, we collected the diet data of COVID-19 from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset), and used a machine-learning algorithm to examine the effects of different food types on COVID-19 incidences and deaths. Specifically, we used the feature selection method to identify the factors (e.g., diet-related factors) that contribute to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Data generated from the study demonstrated that VF intake can help to combat the SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, VF may be potential chemopreventive agents for COVID-19 due to their antiviral properties and their ability to boost the human body immune system.","Yedjou, Clement G; Alo, Richard A; Liu, Jinwei; Enow, Juliet; Ngnepiepa, Pierre; Long, Richard; Latinwo, Lekan; Tchounwou, Paul B",J Nutr Food Sci,371,16

ANIMALS STUDIED: Six adult female cats and the offspring from seven litters. METHODS: Four kittens from uninfected specific pathogen‐free (SPF) queens and 21 kittens from SPF queens inoculated at various times late in gestation with Mozart, Maggie, or ME‐49 strain of T. gondii were used. Ocular examinations were performed on queens prior to and after delivery, and on kittens weekly to bi‐weekly for up to 27 weeks. Whole blood for serology was collected from all kittens at 5½ to 8 weeks of age and again at 12 weeks of age or later. RESULTS: No kittens from noninfected queens developed ocular lesions or antibody to T. gondii. Three of the 24 kittens from infected queens died or were euthanized early in the study. Chorioretinitis was detected in 15 of 21 living kittens from infected queens. Two developed concurrent anterior uveitis that resolved within 1 week. Posterior segment lesions varied ophthalmoscopically between strains. Of 21 kittens from T. gondii‐infected queens, six developed positive antibody titers to T. gondii during the study. All seropositive kittens were born to queens infected with Mozart strain of T. gondii. CONCLUSION: Results of this study suggest that ocular toxoplasmosis can occur without other evidence of clinical illness in kittens infected in utero or in the neonatal period, and that T. gondii strains may have varying degrees of ocular pathogenicity in cats.","Powell, Cynthia C.; Lappin, Michael R.",Vet Ophthalmol,371,9

Limited information on the underlying immune mechanisms that drive disease or protection during COVID-19 severely hamper development of therapeutics and vaccines. Thus, the establishment of relevant animal models that mimic the pathobiology of the disease is urgent. Rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit disease pathobiology similar to human COVID-19, thus serving as a relevant animal model. In the current study, we have characterized the transcriptional signatures induced in the lungs of juvenile and old rhesus macaques following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that genes associated with Interferon (IFN) signaling, neutrophil degranulation and innate immune pathways are significantly induced in macaque infected lungs, while pathways associated with collagen formation are downregulated. In COVID-19, increasing age is a significant risk factor for poor prognosis and increased mortality. We demonstrate that Type I IFN and Notch signaling pathways are significantly upregulated in lungs of juvenile infected macaques when compared with old infected macaques. These results are corroborated with increased peripheral neutrophil counts and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio in older individuals with COVID-19 disease. In contrast, pathways involving VEGF are downregulated in lungs of old infected macaques. Using samples from humans with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, we validate a subset of our findings. Finally, neutrophil degranulation, innate immune system and IFN gamma signaling pathways are upregulated in both tuberculosis and COVID-19, two pulmonary diseases where neutrophils are associated with increased severity.

Using two different approaches based on air-coupled ultrasounds (0.15-1.6 MHz) with equivalent results, this work shows that each face mask presents a distinctive ultrasonic signature that enables the classification and the evaluation of their performance. Moreover, it is shown that the ultrasonic propagation through the face masks and the main filter layers takes place through the pore space and that low frequency response of the attenuation and the velocity is highly dispersive and is dominated by the interaction between the air in the pores and the fibers in the filters. Hence, the parameters that describe ultrasonic velocity, attenuation and dispersion can be related with their filtration efficiency and breathability. These techniques are fully contactless, non-invasive and fast.","Gómez Álvarez-Arenas, Tomás E; Fariñas, María D; Ginel, Alba",Ultrasonics,371,16

Some studies have suggested a negative association between sunlight intensity and COVID-19 infection, alluding to the belief that it might be safe to go out on sunny days. This paper examined whether solar radiation mitigated the association between human mobility and COVID-19 infection in Europe using a dynamic panel data model to investigate the effect of human mobility, solar radiation, and their interaction on COVID-19 infection. The results revealed that outgoing mobility was positively correlated and solar radiation was negatively correlated with COVID-19 infection at lag levels of 1, 2, and 3 weeks. The coefficients of the interaction items indicated that solar radiation negatively moderated the relationship between outgoing mobility and the number of daily new confirmed cases at 2- and 3-week lag levels. However, the moderating effect was limited and unable to eliminate the positive effect of outgoing mobility on COVID-19 infection. Thus, these results suggested that solar radiation only weakly mitigated the relationship between human mobility and COVID-19 infection, providing policy implications that mobility should still be restricted on sunny days during the COVID-19 pandemic.

HCW were challenged with new guidelines and practices to protect themselves from occupational risks. We wished to observe if hand hygiene behavior by real-time measurement was related to the dynamic of the epidemic, and the type of patient being cared for in France. METHODS: This study used an automated hand hygiene recording system to measure HCW hand hygiene on entry to and exit from patient rooms throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed the correlation between hand hygiene compliance and COVID-19 epidemiological data. Analysis of variance was performed to compare compliance rate during the different periods of the epidemic. FINDINGS: HCW hand hygiene rate on room entry decreased over time; on room exit, it increased by 13.73% during the first wave of COVID-19, decreased by 9.87% during the post-lockdown period, then rebounded by 2.82% during the second wave of the epidemic. Hand hygiene during patient care and hand hygiene on room exit had a positive relationship with the local COVID-19 epidemic; conversely, hand hygiene on room entry did not depend on the trend of the epidemic, nor on nursing of COVID-19 patients, and it decreased over time. CONCLUSION: HCW modified their behaviors to face the risk propensity of the pandemic. However, to improve the poor compliance at room entry, reducing confusion between the hand hygiene recommendation and glove recommendation may be necessary; disinfection of gloving hands might solve this issue.","Huang, Fanyu; Armando, Marjorie; Dufau, Stéphane; Florea, Oleg; Brouqui, Philippe; Boudjema, Sophia",J Hosp Infect,371,29

In recent years, public health emergencies such as avian influenza, drug-resistant malaria, and Ebola have brought renewed attention to the need for effective communication channels between health authorities, particularly in regional contexts where neighbouring countries share common health threats. However, little empirical research has been conducted to date to explore the range of factors that may affect the transfer, exchange, and use of public health data and expertise across borders, especially in developing contexts. METHODS: To explore these issues, 60 interviews were conducted with domestic and international stakeholders in Cambodia and Vietnam, selected amongst those who were involved in regional public health programmes and networks. Data analysis was structured around three categories mapped across the dataset: (1) the nature of shared data and information; (2) the nature of communication channels; and (3) how information flow may be affected by the local, regional, and global system of rules and arrangements. RESULTS: There has been a great intensification in the circulation of data, information, and expertise across borders in Southeast Asia. However, findings from this study document ways in which the movement of data and information from production sites to other places can be challenging due to different standards and practices, language barriers, different national structures and rules that govern the circulation of health information inside and outside countries, imbalances in capacities and power, and sustainability of financing arrangements. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the complex socio-technical nature of data and information sharing, suggesting that best practices require significant involvement of an independent third-party brokering organisation or office, which can redress imbalances between country partners at different levels in the data sharing process, create meaningful communication channels and make the most of shared information and data sets.","Liverani, Marco; Teng, Srey; Le, Minh Sat; Coker, Richard",Global Health,371,32

Abdominal manifestations of COVID on imaging are not yet established. The goal of this study was to quantify the frequency of positive findings on abdominopelvic CT in COVID-positive patients, and to identify clinical factors associated with positive findings to assist with imaging triage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included adult COVID-positive patients with abdominopelvic CT performed within 14 days of their COVID PCR nasal swab assay from 3/1/2020 to 5/1/2020. Clinical CT reports were reviewed for the provided indication and any positive abdominopelvic findings. Demographic and laboratory data closest to the CT date were recorded. Multivariate logistic regression model with binary outcome of having no reported positive abdominopelvic findings was constructed. RESULTS: Of 141 COVID-positive patients having abdominopelvic CT (average age 64 years [± 16], 91 [64%] women), 80 (57%) had positive abdominopelvic findings. Abdominal pain was the most common indication, provided in 54% (43/80) and 74% (45/61) of patients with and without reported positive abdominopelvic findings, respectively (p = 0.015). 70% (98/141) of patients overall had reported findings in the lung bases. Findings either typical or intermediate for COVID were reported in 50% (40/80) and 64% (39/61) of patients with and without positive abdominopelvic findings, respectively (p = 0.099). Of 80 patients with positive abdominopelvic findings, 25 (31%) had an abnormality of gastrointestinal tract, and 14 (18%) had solid organ infarctions or vascular thromboses.

CONCLUSION: Abdominopelvic CT performed on COVID-positive patients yielded a positive finding in 57% of patients. Younger age, male gender, and lower hemoglobin were associated with higher odds of having reportable positive abdominopelvic CT findings.","Goldberg-Stein, Shlomit; Fink, Adam; Paroder, Viktoriya; Kobi, Mariya; Yee, Judy; Chernyak, Victoria",Abdom Radiol (NY),371,1

Impact of nutrition interventions on the outcomes have been scientifically assessed and reported. The role of nutrition in limiting the infection related morbidity and mortality does not appear to be a debatable question but nutrition interventions do not appear to be an essential part of current COVID-19 management strategies. Given the nature of pandemic and lack of organism-specific evidence, variability in nutrition interventions and lack of nutrition interventions is not unexpected. However, delay in realization of the crucial need of nutrition interventions to limit the immediate and long term outcomes at personal and community level may aggravate health related issues that can have long term impact on quality of life and economy. Due to existing undernutrition and lack of nutrition related awareness and competence, need for timely and appropriate interventions is much more critical for developing countries. This manuscript highlights the need and feasibility of various nutrition interventions to assure optimum quality of life during and after COVID-19 pandemic. Available evidence provides enough guidance for nutrition interventions that are safe and promise to accrue various degrees of benefits with almost no likelihood of harm.

Specific inhibitors for TGF-βRI, p38 MAPK, MEK, and STAT3 proved that SARS-CoV PLpro induced TGF-β1-dependent up-regulation of Type I collagen in vitro and in vivo. Subcellular localization analysis of SMAD3 and SMAD7 indicated that non-SMAD pathways in TGF-β1 signaling involved in the production of Type I collagen in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro. Comprehensive analysis of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins using immunoprecipitation and nanoLC–MS/MS indicated that SARS-CoV PLpro caused the change in the ubiquitination profile of Rho GTPase family proteins, in which linked with the increase of Rho-like GTPase family proteins. Moreover, selective inhibitors TGF-βRI and STAT6 (AS1517499) ascertained that STAT6 activation was required for PLpro-induced TGF-β1-dependent up-regulation of Type I collagen in human lung epithelial cells.

This study aims at assessing the prevalence of burnout and psychopathological conditions in health professionals working in a health institution in the Northern Italy, and to identify socio-demographic, work-related and psychological predictors of burnout. Methods: Health professionals working in the hospitals of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano were asked to participate to an online anonymous survey investigating socio-demographic data, COVID-19 emergency-related work and psychological factors, state anxiety, psychological distress, post-traumatic symptoms and burnout. Predictors of the three components of burnout were assessed using elastic net regression models. Results: Three hundred and thirty health professionals participated to the online survey. Two hundred and thirty-five health professionals (71.2%) had scores of state anxiety above the clinical cutoff, 88 (26.8%) had clinical levels of depression, 103 (31.3%) of anxiety, 113 (34.3%) of stress, 121 (36.7%) of post-traumatic stress. Regarding burnout, 107 (35.7%) had moderate and 105 (31.9%) severe levels of emotional exhaustion; 46 (14.0%) had moderate and 40 (12.1%) severe levels of depersonalization; 132 (40.1%) had moderate and 113 (34.3%) severe levels of reduced personal accomplishment. Predictors of all the three components of burnout were work hours, psychological comorbidities, fear of infection and perceived support by friends. Predictors of both emotional exhaustion and depersonalization were female gender, being a nurse, working in the hospital, being in contact with COVID-19 patients.

Viral infections are the major cause of asthma exacerbations. We aimed to assess whether there is a relation between NO(2) exposure and the severity of asthma exacerbations caused by proven respiratory viral infections in children. METHODS: A cohort of 114 asthmatic children aged between 8 and 11 years recorded daily upper and lower respiratory-tract symptoms, peak expiratory flow (PEF), and measured personal NO(2) exposures every week for up to 13 months. We took nasal aspirates during reported episodes of upper respiratory-tract illness and tested for infection by common respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria with RT-PCR assays. We used generalised estimating equations to assess the relation between low (<7·5 μg/m(3)), medium (7·5–14 μg/m(3)), and high (>14 μg/m(3)) tertiles of NO(2) exposure in the week before or after upper respiratory-tract infection and the severity of asthma exacerbation in the week after the start of an infection. FINDINGS: One or more viruses were detected in 78% of reported infection episodes, and the medians of NO(2) exposure were 5 (IQR 3·6–6·3), 10 (8·7–12·0), and 21 μg/m(3) (16·8–42·9) for low, medium, and high tertiles, respectively. There were significant increases in the severity of lower respiratory-tract symptom scores across the three tertiles (0·6 for all viruses [p=0·05] and >2 for respiratory syncytial virus [p=0·01]) and a reduction in PEF of more than 12 L/min for picornavirus (p=0·04) for high compared with low NO(2) exposure before the start of the virus-induced exacerbation. INTERPRETATION: High exposure to NO(2) in the week before the start of a respiratory viral infection, and at levels within current air quality standards, is associated with an increase in the severity of a resulting asthma exacerbation.","Chauhan, AJ; Inskip, Hazel M; Linaker, Catherine H; Smith, Sandra; Schreiber, Jacqueline; Johnston, Sebastian L; Holgate, Stephen T",Lancet,371,12

This phenomenon is common to all organisms and the real weight of the many factors involved in its shaping still remains to be fully determined. So far, relatively little attention has been put in the analysis of CUB in bivalve mollusks due to the limited genomic data available. Taking advantage of the massive sequence data generated from next generation sequencing projects, we explored codon preferences in 64 different species pertaining to the six major evolutionary lineages in Bivalvia. We detected remarkable differences across species, which are only partially dependent on phylogeny. While the intensity of CUB is mild in most organisms, a heterogeneous group of species (including Arcida and Mytilida, among the others) display higher bias and a strong preference for AT-ending codons. We show that the relative strength and direction of mutational bias, selection for translational efficiency and for translational accuracy contribute to the establishment of synonymous codon usage in bivalves. Although many aspects underlying bivalve CUB still remain obscure, we provide for the first time an overview of this phenomenon in this large, commercially and environmentally important, class of marine invertebrates.","Gerdol, Marco; De Moro, Gianluca; Venier, Paola; Pallavicini, Alberto",PeerJ,371,16

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anti-TB drugs are key in the optimization of TB treatment and help to prevent slow response to treatment, acquired drug resistance, and adverse drug effects. The aim of this review was to provide an update on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anti-TB drugs and to show how population pharmacokinetics and Bayesian dose adjustment can be used to optimize treatment. We cover aspects on preclinical, clinical, and population pharmacokinetics of different drugs used for drug-susceptible TB and multidrug-resistant TB. Moreover, we include available data to support therapeutic drug monitoring of these drugs and known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic targets that can be used for optimization of therapy. We have identified a wide range of population pharmacokinetic models for first- and second-line drugs used for TB, which included models built on NONMEM, Pmetrics, ADAPT, MWPharm, Monolix, Phoenix, and NPEM2 software. The first population models were built for isoniazid and rifampicin; however, in recent years, more data have emerged for both new anti-TB drugs, but also for defining targets of older anti-TB drugs. Since the introduction of therapeutic drug monitoring for TB over 3 decades ago, further development of therapeutic drug monitoring in TB next steps will again depend on academic and clinical initiatives. We recommend close collaboration between researchers and the World Health Organization to provide important guideline updates regarding therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics.","Sturkenboom, Marieke G.

However, the social and communication difficulties of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can make reciprocal play more difficult and play between siblings can be less rewarding. Sibling play can serve an important role in intervention and family cohesiveness, but there is no consistent method for involving siblings in intervention benefitting the sibling dyad. This study evaluated a novel treatment package including training siblings on play strategies to increase positive sibling play in combination with a sibling support group to offer social support for the neurotypical sibling (NT). The effects of the treatment package on NT sibling play and fidelity of implementation of naturalistic play strategies was examined using a concurrent multiple-baseline design across six dyads, five of whom completed the intervention. After behavior skills training, all NT siblings increased the number of strategies they used, and increased the frequency of initiations towards their sibling with ASD. In addition, the percentage of reciprocal play between siblings increased. Generalization probes and follow-up probes demonstrated above-baseline levels of performance across most dyads, indicating that the skills learned generalized across other toys and were maintained over time. Only three of the sibling support group sessions were completed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the effectiveness of the sibling support group cannot be determined, social validity questionnaires suggest siblings and parents valued and liked the support group.

As such, chlorophytes comprise a diverse structural class of secondary metabolites, having functional groups that are specific to a particular source. All bioactive compounds of chlorophyte are of great interest due to their supplemental/nutritional/pharmacological activities. In this review, a detailed description of the chemical diversity of compounds encompassing alkaloids, terpenes, steroids, fatty acids and glycerides, their subclasses and their structures are discussed. These promising natural products have efficiency in developing new drugs necessary in the treatment of various deadly pathologies (cancer, HIV, SARS-CoV-2, several inflammations, etc.). Marine chlorophyte, therefore, is portrayed as a pivotal treasure in the case of drugs having marine provenience. It is a domain of research expected to probe novel pharmaceutically or nutraceutically important secondary metabolites resulting from marine Chlorophyta. In this regard, our review aims to compile the isolated secondary metabolites having diverse chemical structures from chlorophytes (like Caulerpa ssp., Ulva ssp., Tydemania ssp., Penicillus ssp., Codium ssp., Capsosiphon ssp., Avrainvillea ssp.), their biological properties, applications and possible mode of action.","Shah, Sayed Asmat Ali; Hassan, Syed Shams ul; Bungau, Simona; Si, Yongsheng; Xu, Haiwei; Rahman, Md.

Mobility plays a central role in this dilemma because the movement of people enables both economic activity and virus spread. We use mobility data in the form of counts of travellers between regions, to extend the often-used SEIR models to include mobility between regions. We quantify the trade-off between mobility and infection spread in terms of a single parameter, to be chosen by policy makers, and propose strategies for restricting mobility so that the restrictions are minimal while the infection spread is effectively limited. We consider restrictions where the country is divided into regions, and study scenarios where mobility is allowed within these regions, and disallowed between them. We propose heuristic methods to approximate optimal choices for these regions. We evaluate the obtained restrictions based on our trade-off. The results show that our methods are especially effective when the infections are highly concentrated, e.g. around a few municipalities, as resulting from superspreading events that play an important role in the spread of COVID-19. We demonstrate our method in the example of the Netherlands. The results apply more broadly when mobility data are available.","Gösgens, Martijn; Hendriks, Teun; Boon, Marko; Steenbakkers, Wim; Heesterbeek, Hans; van der Hofstad, Remco; Litvak, Nelly","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",371,20

Tmprss1, Tmprss3, and Tmprss5 are expressed in the spiral ganglion neurons and the organ of Corti in the inner ear; however, Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin expression profiles in the middle ear remain unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin expression in the middle and inner ear of mice. Study Design Animal research. Setting Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, University of Tokyo. Methods We performed immunohistochemical analysis to examine the distribution of Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin in the eustachian tube, middle ear space, and cochlea of mice. Results Ace2 was expressed in the cytoplasm in the middle ear epithelium, eustachian tube epithelium, stria vascularis, and spiral ganglion. Tmprss2 and Furin were widely expressed in the middle ear spaces and the cochlea. Conclusion Co-expression of Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin in the middle ear indicates that the middle ear is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infections, thus warranting the use of personal protective equipment during mastoidectomy for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients.","Uranaka, Tsukasa; Kashio, Akinori; Ueha, Rumi; Sato, Taku; Bing, Han; Ying, Gao; Kinoshita, Makoto; Kondo, Kenji; Yamasoba, Tatsuya",bioRxiv,371,5

Building on an existing health partnership and extensive action-research on maternal health, it focused on maternal sepsis. Sepsis is one of the main causes of maternal mortality in Uganda and surgical site infection, a major contributing factor. Post-natal wards also consume the largest volume of antibiotics. The findings from the Maternal Sepsis Intervention demonstrate the potential for remarkable changes in health worker behaviour through multi-disciplinary engagement. Nurses and midwives create the connective tissue linking pharmacy, laboratory scientists and junior doctors to support an evidence-based response to prescribing. These multi-disciplinary ‘huddles’ form a necessary, but insufficient, grounding for active clinical pharmacy. The impact on antimicrobial stewardship and maternal mortality and morbidity is ultimately limited by very poor and inconsistent access to antibiotics and supplies. Insufficient and predictable stock-outs undermine behaviour change frustrating health workers’ ability to exercise their knowledge and skill for the benefit of their patients. This escalates healthcare costs and contributes to anti-microbial resistance.","Ackers, Louise; Ackers-Johnson, Gavin; Seekles, Maaike; Odur, Joe; Opio, Samuel",Antibiotics (Basel),371,5

When mortality conditions are changing rapidly, however, that intuitive interpretation of the PLEB for short reference periods and of its change conflict with the assumptions under which the PLEB is derived. To avoid assumptions about future mortality, I propose measuring instead the Mean Unfulfilled Lifespan (MUL), defined as the average difference between the actual and otherwise expected ages at death in a recent death cohort. For fine-grained tracking of the pandemic, I also provide an empirical shortcut to MUL estimation for small areas or short periods. I estimate quarterly MUL values for the first half of 2020 in 142 national populations and 91 sub-national populations in Italy, Spain and the US. Across countries, the highest quarterly values were reached in the second quarter in Peru (3.90 years) and in Ecuador (4.59 years). Higher quarterly values still were found in New York and New Jersey, where individuals died respectively 5.41 and 5.56 years younger on average than their expected age at death. Using a seven-day rolling window, I estimate the MUL peaked at 7.32 years in Lombardy, 8.96 years in Madrid, and 8.93 years in New York, but reached 12.86 years for the entire month of April in Guayas (Ecuador). These results illustrate how the MUL provides an intuitive metric to track the pandemic without requiring assumptions about future mortality.","Heuveline, Patrick",medRxiv,371,16

The prevalence of bronchiectasis is age-related and there is some geographical variation in incidence, prevalence and clinical features. Most bronchiectasis is reported to be idiopathic however post-infectious aetiologies dominate across Asia especially secondary to tuberculosis. Most focus to date has been on the study of airway bacteria, both as colonisers and causes of exacerbations. Modern molecular technologies including next generation sequencing (NGS) have become invaluable tools to identify microorganisms directly from sputum and which are difficult to culture using traditional agar based methods. These have provided important insight into our understanding of emerging pathogens in the airways of people with bronchiectasis and the geographical differences that occur. The contribution of the lung microbiome, its ethnic variation, and subsequent roles in disease progression and response to therapy across geographic regions warrant further investigation.

The Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine that prevents severe forms of tuberculosis is getting more attention in this scenario. The objective of our study was to determine the association between BCG vaccine coverage and incidence of COVID-19 at a national-level across the Globe. METHODS: The data of 160 countries were included in the study. Meta-regression was done to estimate the difference in the incidence of COVID-19 cases between countries with BCG vaccination coverage. BCG coverage was categorized as ≤70%, >70% and no vaccination. The analyses were carried out by adjusting for factors such as population density, income group, latitude, and percentage of the total population under age groups 15–64 and above 65 years of each country. RESULTS: The countries that had ≤70% coverage of BCG vaccine reported 6.5 (95% CI: −8.4 to −4.5) less COVID-19 infections per 10,000 population as compared to countries that reported no coverage. Those that had >70% coverage reported 10.1 (95% CI: −11.4 to −8.7) less infections per 10,000 population compared to those with no BCG countries. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that BCG is associated with reduced COVID-19 infections if the BCG vaccine coverage is over 70%. The region-wise analyses also suggested similar findings, except the Middle East and North African region.","Joy, Melvin; Malavika, B.; Asirvatham, Edwin Sam; Sudarsanam, Thambu David; Jeyaseelan, L.",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,371,23

Less evidence of cross-reactive memory CD8 T cells has been documented to date. METHODS: We used the NetCTLPan neural network of the Epitope Database and Analysis Resource to select a series of 27 HLA-A*02:01 epitopes derived from the proteome of SARS-CoV-2. Their binding capacity was assessed by a HLA-A*02:01 stabilization assay and by quantifying their binding to HLA-A*02:01 monomers for the generation of tetramers. Their ability to stimulate and induce expansion of SARS-CoV-2 reactive CD8 T cells was measured by flow cytometry. The TCR repertoire of COVID convalescent and healthy unexposed donors was analysed using the MIRA database. FINDINGS: The HLA-A*02:01 epitopes tested were able to stabilise HLA molecules and induce activation of CD8 T cells of healthy unexposed donors. Our results, based on specific tetramer binding, provide evidence supporting the presence of frequent cross-reactive CD8 T cells to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in non-exposed individuals. Interestingly, the reactive cells were distributed into naïve, memory and effector subsets. INTERPRETATION: Our data are consistent with a significant proportion of the reactive CD8 T clones belonging to the public shared repertoire, readily available in absence of previous contact with closely related coronaviruses. Furthermore, we demonstrate the immunogenic capacity of long peptides carrying T cell epitopes, which can serve to isolate virus-specific T cell receptors among the ample repertoire of healthy unexposed subjects and could have application in COVID-19 immunotherapy. Limitations of our study are that it concentrated on one MHC I allele (HLA-A*02:01) and the low numbers of samples and epitopes tested.","Quiros-Fernandez, Isaac; Poorebrahim, Mansour; Fakhr, Elham; Cid-Arregui, Angel",EBioMedicine,371,24

A virtual cardiovascular care program, consisting of patient selection, initial televisit, postconsultation care planning, and follow-up televisits, was developed and delivered by Heartbeat Health, Inc., a cardiovascular digital health company, to 11 SNFs (3510 beds) in New York. The impact of this program on the expected SNF 30-day HF readmission rate is unknown, particularly in the COVID-19 era. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess whether a virtual cardiovascular care program could reduce the 30-day hospital readmission rate for patients with HF discharged to SNF relative to the expected rate for this population. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case review of SNF patients who received a virtual cardiology consultation between August 2020 and February 2021. Virtual cardiologists conducted 1 or more telemedicine visit via smartphone, tablet, or laptop for cardiac patients identified by a SNF care team. Postconsult care plans were communicated to SNF clinical staff. Patients included in this analysis had a preceding index admission for HF. RESULTS: We observed lower hospital readmission among patients who received 1 or more virtual consultations compared with the expected readmission rate for both cardiac (3% vs 10%, respectively) and all-cause etiologies (18% vs 27%, respectively) in a population of 3510 patients admitted to SNF. A total of 185/3510 patients (5.27%) received virtual cardiovascular care via the Heartbeat Health program, and 40 patients met study inclusion criteria and were analyzed, with 26 (65%) requiring 1 televisit and 14 (35%) requiring more than 1. Cost savings associated with this reduction in readmissions are estimated to be as high as US $860 per patient.

As a novel disease with protean manifestations, it has pushed the scientific community into a frenzy to find a cure. The chloroquine class of compounds, used for decades for their antimalarial activity, have been well characterized. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a less toxic metabolite of chloroquine, is used to treat rheumatic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and Sjögren’s syndrome. Preliminary studies in non-randomized clinical trials point to the possible use of chloroquine and its derivatives in the treatment of coronavirus. However, more robust clinical studies carried out in the United States, Italy, Australia, and China have shown mixed and inconclusive results and indicate the need for additional research. Cardiac, neurological, and retinal toxicity as well as increasing parasite resistance to these drugs is a major hindrance for their use in a world that is already dealing with antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In this context, we chose to study the monoquinoline analogs of 4-aminoquinoline as well as their metabolites which have the same mechanism of action albeit with lower toxicity. All the compounds were extensively studied computationally using docking, cheminformatics, and toxicity prediction tools. Based on the docking scores against ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) receptors and the toxicity data computed by employing the chemical analyzer module by ViridisChem(™) Inc., the work reveals significant findings that can help in the process of use of these metabolites against coronavirus.","Vaidya, Niteen A.; Vyas, Renu",Front Pharmacol,371,27

The amount of aerosol generation from the respiratory tract with these various oxygen modalities is unknown. Objectives: To measure the size and number concentration of particles and droplets generated from the respiratory tract of humans exposed to various oxygen delivery modalities. Methods: Ten healthy participants with no active pulmonary disease were enrolled. Oxygen modalities tested included nonhumidified nasal cannula, face mask, heated and humidified high-flow nasal cannula, and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. Aerosol generation was measured with each oxygen mode while participants performed maneuvers of normal breathing, talking, deep breathing, and coughing. Testing was conducted in a negative-pressure room. Particles with a diameter between 0.37 and 20 μm were measured using an aerodynamic particle spectrometer. Measurements and Main Results: Median particle concentration ranged from 0.041 to 0.168 particles/cm(3). Median diameter ranged from 1.01 to 1.53 μm. Cough significantly increased the number of particles measured. Measured aerosol concentration did not significantly increase with the use of either humidified high-flow nasal cannula or noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. This was the case during normal breathing, talking, deep breathing, and coughing. Conclusions: Oxygen delivery modalities of humidified high-flow nasal cannula and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation do not increase aerosol generation from the respiratory tract in healthy human participants with no active pulmonary disease measured in a negative-pressure room.","Gaeckle, Nathaniel T.; Lee, Jihyeon; Park, Yensil; Kreykes, Gean; Evans, Michael D.; Hogan, Christopher J.",Am J Respir Crit Care Med,371,24

This study aims to investigate social perception of coronavirus in the Internet media during the epidemic. It is a signal report highlighting the main issues in public perception and medical commutation in real time. METHODS: We study the perception of COVID-19 epidemic in Polish society using quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the Internet on platforms: Google, Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by Event Registry, from January 2020 to 29.04.2020 (before and after official introduction to Poland on 04.03.20). We present trend analysis with a support of natural language processing techniques. RESULTS: We identified seven temporal major clusters of interest on the topic COVID-19: 1) Chinese, 2) Italian, 3) Waiting, 4) Mitigations, 5) Social distancing and Lockdown, 6) Anti-crisis shield, 7) Restrictions releasing. There was an exponential increase of interest when the Polish government declared war against disease around 11/12.03.20 with a massive mitigation program. Later on, there was a decay in interest with additional phases related to social distancing and an anti-crisis legislation act with local peaks. We have found that declarations of mitigation strategies by the Polish prime minister or the minister of health gathered the highest attention of Internet users. So enacted or in force events do not affect interest to such extent. Traditional news agencies were ahead of social media (mainly Twitter) in dissemination of information. We have observed very weak or even negative correlations between a colloquial searching term antiviral mask in Google, encyclopaedic definition in Wikipedia SARS-CoV-2 as well official incidence series, implying different mechanisms governing the search for knowledge, panic related behaviour and actual risk of acquiring infection. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional and social media do not only reflect reality, but also create it. Risk perception in Poland is unrelated to actual physical risk of acquiring COVID-19. As traditional media are ahead of social media in time, we advise to choose traditional news media for a quick dissemination of information, however for a greater impact, social media should be used. Otherwise public information campaigns might have less impact on society than expected.","Jarynowski, A.; Wojta-Kempa, M.; Belik, V.",,371,21

The concentrations measured during the lockdown in 2020 were compared to those obtained during the same period over the preceding five years. The average decrease in the levels of NOx and traffic-related volatile organic compounds was higher than 50 %, while O3 concentrations did not exhibit significant variations during the study period. Our results show that temporal variations in PM1 and PM10 concentrations were strongly affected by the frequency of Saharan dust events. When these episodes were excluded from the analysis period, a 35 % decrease in PM1 and PM10 levels was observed. Traffic restrictions during the lockdown led to important reductions in the concentrations of elemental carbon and metals derived from road dust (e.g. Ca and Fe) and break wear (e.g. Cu). Regarding secondary inorganic aerosols, nitrate showed the largest reductions as a consequence of the drop in local emissions of NOx.","Clemente, Álvaro; Yubero, Eduardo; Nicolás, Jose F; Caballero, Sandra; Crespo, Javier; Galindo, Nuria",Environ Res,371,16

Poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) particles were chosen as well-known model carriers and ovalbumin (OVA) as the model antigen. Aiming at application to the respiratory tract, which allows direct interaction of the formulation with the mucosal immune system, this work focuses on the feasibility of delivering the antigen in a nanoparticulate carrier within a powder capable of pulmonary delivery. Further requirements were adequate antigen encapsulation in order to use the characteristics of the particulate carrier for (tunable) antigen release, and capability of the production process for industrialisation (realisation in industry). For an effective particulate antigen uptake, nanoparticles with a size of around 300 nm were prepared. For this, two production methods for nanoparticles, solvent change precipitation and the double emulsion method, were evaluated with respect to antigen incorporation, transfer to a dry powder formulation, redispersion and antigen release characteristics. A spray drying step was included in the production procedure in order to obtain a respirable powder with an aerodynamic particle size of between 0.5 and 5 μm. The dried products were characterised for particle size, dispersibility and aerodynamic behaviour, as well as for immune response and cytotoxicity in cell culture models. It could be shown that the double emulsion method is suitable to prepare nanoparticles (270 nm) and to incorporate the antigen. By modifying the production method to prepare porous particles, it was possible to obtain an acceptable antigen release while maintaining an antigen load of about 10%. By the choice of polyvinyl alcohol as a stabiliser, nanoparticles could be dried and redispersed without further excipients and the production steps were capable of realisation in industry. Aerodynamic characteristics were good with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 3.3 µm upon dispersion from a capsule-based inhaler.","Scherließ, Regina; Janke, Julia",Pharmaceutics,371,17

In February 2007, mumps re-emerged in university students in Nova Scotia. Despite highly sensitive methods for mumps virus detection, only 14% (298/2082) of cases during the peak of the outbreak were laboratory confirmed. OBJECTIVES: Due to the low positivity rate, this study investigated whether infection with other viral pathogens caused mumps-like presentations during the outbreak. STUDY DESIGN: 148 buccal specimens from patients who presented with unilateral or bilateral parotitis but had negative laboratory tests for mumps virus were tested for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) by quantitative PCR and 21 different viral markers using the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP). Companion sera to each buccal specimen were available for EBV and CMV serology to differentiate acute infection from reactivation. RESULTS: No correlation was observed since viral pathogens were detected in both the parotitis and non-parotitis groups. CONCLUSION: Although there was co-circulation of other viral pathogens during the mumps outbreak, no difference was observed in the prevalence between patients who presented with or without parotitis. The low positivity rate for specimens submitted for mumps diagnostics was likely the result of increased Public Health messaging and physician inexperience in recognizing mumps infection, suggesting the clinical acumen for mumps diagnosis based solely on clinical presentation is low.","Hatchette, Todd F.; Mahony, James B.; Chong, Sylvia; LeBlanc, Jason J.",J Clin Virol,371,1

Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is increasingly being reported, complicating the decision to initiate or resume anticoagulation as providers balance the risk of thrombotic disease with the risk of bleeding. Our study aimed to assess rebleeding rates in COVID-19 patients with GIB and determine whether endoscopy reduces these rebleeding events. We also report 30-day VTE and mortality rates. Methods This was a retrospective study evaluating 56 COVID-19 patients with GIB for the following outcomes: 30-day rebleeding rate, 30-day VTE rate, effects of endoscopic intervention on the rate of rebleeding, and 30-day mortality. Results The overall rates of VTE and rebleeding events were 27 % and 41 %, respectively. Rebleeding rates in patients managed conservatively was 42 % compared with 40 % in the endoscopy group. Overall, 87 % of those who underwent invasive intervention resumed anticoagulation vs. 55 % of those managed medically ( P = 0.02). The all-cause 30-day mortality and GIB-related deaths were 32 % and 9 %, respectively. Mortality rates between the endoscopic and conservative management groups were not statistically different (25 % vs. 39 %; P = 0.30). Conclusions Although rebleeding rates were similar between the endoscopic and conservative management groups, patients who underwent intervention were more likely to restart anticoagulation. While endoscopy appeared to limit the duration that anticoagulation was withheld, larger studies are needed to further characterize its direct effect on mortality outcomes in these complex patients.","Attah, Emmanuel; Martin, Tracey A.; Smith, Emily S.; Tewani, Sunena; Hajifathalian, Kaveh; Sharaiha, Reem Z.; Crawford, Carl V.; Wan, David",Endosc Int Open,371,24

Retrospectively, some of these factors could have been avoided or minimized. Many infection control approaches recommended by public health experts and regulators, while well intended to keep people safe from disease exposure, threatened other vital aspects of health and well-being. Furthermore, focusing narrowly on infection control practices does not address longstanding operational and infrastructural factors that contributed significantly to the pandemic toll. In this article, we review traditional (ie institutional) long-term care practices that were associated with increased risk during the pandemic and highlight one transformational model (the Green House Project) that worked well to protect the lives and livelihood of people within congregate care settings. Drawing on this evidence, we identify specific strategies for necessary and overdue improvements in long-term care homes.","Power, G Allen; Carson, Jennifer",Healthc Manage Forum,371,32

However, a better knowledge of molecular mechanisms contributing to liver damage is required, and it is unknown whether the RHDV induces liver autophagy and how it relates to apoptosis. In this study, we attempted to explore which signalling pathways were involved in the autophagic response induced by the RHDV and to characterize their role in the context of RHDV pathogenesis. Rabbits were infected with 2 × 10(4) hemmaglutination units of a RHDV isolate. The autophagic response was measured as presence of autophagic vesicles, LC3 staining, conversion of LC3-I to autophagosome-associated LC3-II and changes in expression of beclin-1, UVRAG, Atg5, Atg12, Atg16L1 and p62/SQSTM1. RHDV-triggered autophagy reached a maximum at 24 hours post-infection (hpi) and declined at 30 and 36 hpi. Phosphorylation of mTOR also augmented in early periods of infection and there was an increase in the expression of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperones BiP/GRP78, CHOP and GRP94. Apoptosis, measured as caspase-3 activity and expression of PARP-1, increased significantly at 30 and 36 hpi in parallel to the maximal expression of the RHDV capsid protein VP60. These data indicate that RHDV infection initiates a rapid autophagic response, perhaps in an attempt to protect liver, which associates to ER stress development and is independent from downregulation of the major autophagy suppressor mTOR. As the infection continues and the autophagic response declines, cells begin to exhibit apoptosis.","Vallejo, Daniela; Crespo, Irene; San-Miguel, Beatriz; Álvarez, Marcelino; Prieto, Jesús; Tuñón, María Jesús; González-Gallego, Javier",Vet Res,371,26

Use of corticosteroids was harmful in other coronavirus infections previously. WHO recommended against routine use of corticosteroids in COVID-19. In view of these, we reviewed the evidence about the use of corticosteroids in virus-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Corticosteroids are beneficial in ARDS regardless of etiology. However, they increased the mortality rate in influenza-associated ARDS. In SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome, corticosteroids increased the mortality, delayed the viral clearance and increased the length of hospital stay. In the case of COVID-19, the available evidence from retrospective and observational studies is inconclusive about the corticosteroid use. Low-dose therapies appear to be effective. Evidence from a randomized control study found dexamethasone is effective in decreasing mortality in severe COVID-19 cases.

Household transmission is thought to contribute significantly to subsequent transmission through the broader community. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, contactless surveillance methods are of particular importance. METHODS: From November 2019 to April 2020, 303 households in the Seattle area were remotely monitored in a prospective longitudinal study for symptoms of respiratory viral illness. Enrolled participants reported weekly symptoms and submitted respiratory samples by mail in the event of an acute respiratory illness (ARI). Specimens were tested for fourteen viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, using RT-PCR. Participants completed all study procedures at home without physical contact with research staff. RESULTS: In total, 1171 unique participants in 303 households were monitored for ARI. Of participating households, 128 (42%) included a child aged <5 years and 202 (67%) included a child aged 5-12 years. Of the 678 swabs collected during the surveillance period, 237 (35%) tested positive for one or more non-influenza respiratory viruses. Rhinovirus, common human coronaviruses, and respiratory syncytial virus were the most common. Four cases of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in three households. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the circulation of respiratory viruses within households during the winter months during the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

This longitudinal study investigated the social participation, social inclusion and psychological well-being in adults with and without mental disorders before the beginning of the pandemic, as well as during and after strict lockdown restrictions in Germany. METHODS: The sample (n = 106) consisted of three groups: participants with a chronic mental disorder, with an acute mental disorder, and without a mental disorder at the time of the initial survey. Parameters of interest were assessed using the Measure of Participation and Social Inclusion for Use in People with a Chronic Mental Disorder (F-INK), the Index for the Assessment of Health Impairments (IMET) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18). RESULTS: The perceived impairments in social participation and the associated changes in behaviour varied depending on the presence of a mental disorder at the time of the initial survey and were largely temporary, i.e. limited to the period of strict lockdown restrictions. We found no further detrimental effects on mental health 4 weeks after lockdown or later, when a policy of physical distancing was in place. CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings suggest a general resilience to the official restrictions and measures as well as the pandemic itself. However, further efforts are needed to improve the situation of people with chronic mental disorders and their limited opportunities for social participation.

This assumes importance not only in outreach clinics but also in the ongoing pandemic caused by the highly contagious novel coronavirus, where social distancing is advocated to contain the spread. We aimed to compare the axial ACD in PXF and normal patients by SACD, and its agreement with the anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) and LenstarLS-900. Methods: A prospective comparative observational study was done at a tertiary eye care hospital. A PXF group and a normal group of controls were recruited. All eyes were phakic with normal cornea. Any eye with previous intraocular/refractive surgery and cause of other secondary or uncontrolled glaucoma was excluded. SACD was measured clinically via slit-lamp method and also via ASOCT and Lenstar; agreement between the methodologies was plotted. Results: Fifty patients were recruited in each group. Mean age was 66.82 ± 4.88 years in PXF patients and 65 ± 5.46 years in controls (P = 0.2). ACD was found to be greater in controls compared with the PXF patients; this difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001) across all methodologies. A good agreement with narrow 95% limits of agreement was found between these methodologies. Conclusion: Redmond Smith slit-lamp methodology of estimating the axial ACD is recommended as a rapid, quantifiable, noncontact screening technique during routine examination, especially in primary outreach centers, and is also advantageous during the ongoing pandemic by reducing expendable investigations.","Pathak Ray, Vanita; Ramesh, Smitha B; Rathi, Varsha",Indian J Ophthalmol,371,16

We recently reported that the CD45-intracellular signals in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients are inhibited. We also reported that C24D, an immune modulating therapeutic peptide, binds to CD45 on immune-suppressed cells and resets the functionality of the immune system via the CD45 signaling pathway. Various studies have demonstrated that also viruses can interfere with the functions of CD45 and that patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are immune-suppressed. Given the similarity between the role of CD45 in viral immune suppression and our findings on TNBC, we hypothesized that the C24D peptide may have a similar “immune-resetting” effect on PBMCs from COVID-19 patients as it did on PBMCs from TNBC patients. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the CD45/TCR intracellular signaling in PBMCs from ten COVID-19 patients vs. PBMCs from ten healthy volunteers. Herein, we report our findings, demonstrating the immune reactivating effect of C24D via the phosphorylation of the tyrosine 505 and 394 in Lck, the tyrosine 493 in ZAP-70 and the tyrosine 172 in VAV-1 proteins in the CD45 signaling pathway. Despite the relatively small number of patients in this report, the results demonstrate that C24D rescued CD45 signaling. Given the central role played by CD45 in the immune system, we suggest CD45 as a potential therapeutic target.","Alon, Danny; Paitan, Yossi; Robinson, Eyal; Ganor, Nirit; Lipovetsky, Julia; Yerushalmi, Rinat; Cohen, Cyrille J.; Raiter, Annat",Front Med (Lausanne),371,20

It is defined clinically as failure to conceive after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. The contribution of various aetiological factors to infertility differs per population. The causes of infertility have not been assessed in Zimbabwe. Our objectives were to determine the reproductive characteristics, causes and outcomes of women presenting for infertility care. METHODS: A retrospective and prospective study of women who had not conceived within a year of having unprotected intercourse presenting in private and public facilities in Harare was done. A diagnosis was made based on the history, examination and results whenever these were deemed sufficient. Data was analysed using STATA SE/15. A total of 216 women were recruited. RESULTS: Of the 216 women recruited, two thirds (144) of them had primary infertility. The overall period of infertility ranged from 1 to 21 years with an average of 5.6 ± 4.7 years whilst 98 (45.4%) of the couples had experienced 2–4 years of infertility and 94 (43.5%) had experience 5 or more years of infertility. About 1 in 5 of the women had irregular menstrual cycles with 10 of them having experienced amenorrhoea of at least 1 year. Almost half of the participants (49%) were overweight or obese. The most common cause for infertility was ‘unexplained’ in 22% of the women followed by tubal blockage in 20%, male factor in 19% and anovulation in 16%. Of the 49 (22.7%) women who conceived 21(9.7%) had a live birth while 23 (10.7%) had an ongoing pregnancy at the end of follow up. Thirty-seven (17.1%) had Assisted Reproduction Techniques (ART) in the form of Invitro-fertilisation/Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (IVF/ICSI) or Intra-Uterine Insemination (IUI). Assisted Reproduction was significantly associated with conception. CONCLUSION: Most women present when chances of natural spontaneous conception are considerably reduced. This study shows an almost equal contribution between tubal blockage, male factor and unexplained infertility.

The derivation of the HOI utilizes the data-reduction technique of principal component analysis to determine the impact of SDH on optimal health at lower census geographies. In the midst of persistent health disparities and the present COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrate the potential utility of using 13-input variables to derive a composite metric of health (HOI) score as a means to assist in the identification of the most vulnerable communities during the current pandemic. Using GIS mapping technology, health opportunity indices were layered by counties in Ohio to highlight differences by census tract. Collectively we demonstrate that our HOI framework, principal component analysis and convergence analysis methodology coalesce to provide results supporting the utility of this framework in the three largest counties in Ohio: Franklin (Columbus), Cuyahoga (Cleveland), and Hamilton (Cincinnati). The results in this study identified census tracts that were also synonymous with communities that were at risk for disparate COVID-19 related health outcomes. In this regard, convergence analyses facilitated identification of census tracts where different disparate health outcomes co-exist at the worst levels. Our results suggest that effective use of the HOI composite score and subcomponent scores to identify specific SDH can guide mitigation/intervention practices, thus creating the potential for better targeting of mitigation and intervention strategies for vulnerable communities, such as during the current pandemic.","Ogojiaku, Chinonso N.; Allen, JC; Anson-Dwamena, Rexford; Barnett, Kierra S.; Adetona, Olorunfemi; Im, Wansoo; Hood, Darryl B.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,371,11

Those with severe disease are treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) but with poor outcomes. Concomitant right ventricular assist device (RVAD) may be beneficial. Methods: A retrospective analysis of intensive care unit patients admitted with COVID-19 ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) was performed. Non-intubated patients, those with acute kidney injury, and age > 75 were excluded. Patients who underwent RVAD/ECMO support were compared with those managed via invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) alone. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-day mortality, acute kidney injury, length of ICU stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation. Results: A total of 145 patients were admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. Thirty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 21 received IMV, and 18 received RVAD/ECMO. In-hospital (52.4 vs 11.1%, p=0.008) and 30-day mortality (42.9 vs 5.6%, p=0.011) were significantly lower in patients treated with RVAD/ECMO. Acute kidney injury occurred in 15 (71.4%) patients in the IMV group and zero RVAD/ECMO patients (p<0.001). ICU (11.5 vs 21 days, p=0.067) and hospital (14 vs 25.5 days, p=0.054) length of stay were not significantly different. There were no RVAD/ECMO device complications. The duration of mechanical ventilation was not significantly different (10 vs 5 days, p=0.44). Conclusions: RVAD support at the time of ECMO initiation resulted in the no secondary end-organ damage and higher in-hospital and 30-day survival versus IMV in specially selected patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS. Management of severe COVID-19 ARDS should prioritize right ventricular support.","Cain, Michael T.; Smith, Nathan J.; Barash, Mark; Simpson, Pippa; Durham, Lucian A.; Makker, Hemanckur; Roberts, Christopher; Falcucci, Octavio; Wang, Dong; Walker, Rebekah; Ahmed, Gulrayz; Brown, Sherry-Ann; Nanchal, Rahul S.; Joyce, David L.",J Surg Res,371,8

We investigated the etiology by the culture of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, urine antigen testing of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumoniae, and DNA or RNA determination of eight kinds of respiratory virus DNA or RNA. An etiological diagnosis was made in 51.8% of 197 patients. The most common pathogens were M. pneumoniae (29.4%) followed by influenza virus A, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus (9.6%), and S. pneumoniae (4.1%). Patients with mycoplasma infections were younger, less likely to have comorbidities, and less likely to have adequate sputum for gram stain and culture. Patients with viral infections were older and more likely to have poorly defined nodules on chest X-ray (CXR) or computed tomography (CT) scan. Among patients infected with M. pneumoniae, those with quinolones as initial prescriptions had shorter duration of fever after the initiation of antibiotics than patients with β-lactams, macrolides, or β-lactams + macrolides (p < 0.05). This study suggests that M. pneumoniae and respiratory viruses were the most frequent pathogens found in ambulatory adult CAP patients and quinolones were better than β-lactams, macrolides, or β-lactams + macrolides in the resolution of fever of M. pneumoniae pneumonia.","Cao, B.; Ren, L.-L.; Zhao, F.; Gonzalez, R.; Song, S.-F.; Bai, L.; Yin, Y.

Planning and rapid implementation of assessment through an online format presents the next set of novel challenges that must be addressed by academic administrations across the globe. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between March to August 2020 at the Aga Khan University Medical College. Two hundred medical students of year 1 and 2 participated in the study. We describe the planning, processes, and outcomes of online assessments using video communication platforms conducted at a private university in Pakistan. Standardized protocols were written and piloted, extensive training of student, proctors and staff for preparation and conduct of online assessments were developed. Feedback was recorded after each session and suggestions were incorporated in subsequent high-stakes assessments. RESULTS: A total of three pilot assessments were conducted to identify issues and process refinement. Commercially available lockdown browser and ZOOM were used in the first pilot; 80% of the class was unable to launch lockdown browser and laptops required repeated reload/reboot. For the second pilot assessment, University’s VLE page & MS Teams was trailed. Issues with internet connectivity, VLE page slowdown, and suboptimal recording feature in MS Teams were identified. For the final pilot assessment, phased launching of VLE page with single test item per page was implemented with success. The students reported that attempting the online exam on VLE with ZOOM support was user friendly. Ninety percent of the class was supportive of the continuing with the online assessments. CONCLUSION: In order to device an effective protocol for e-assessments conducting multiple trial runs, and incorporating feedback from all stakeholders is a necessity.","Fatima, Syeda Sadia; Idrees, Romana; Jabeen, Kausar; Sabzwari, Saniya; Khan, Sadaf",Pak J Med Sci,371,28

This is important as students need to understand, the wider impacts of animal and environmental health factors on human health. IPE initiatives which typically incorporate the principles of OH, can provide MD and veterinary (DVM) students with a greater awareness of the role that animal diseases and climate change have on global health. However, negative attitudes to IPE have been reported as a key limitation to IPE implementation. The purpose of this paper is to examine the differences in readiness for interprofessional learning of medical and other allied human health professional students, including veterinarians and students undertaking dual degrees in combination with a Master of Public Health (MPH). Reflecting on Role Theory (RT) and Social Identity Theory (SIT), the paper aims to contribute to the understanding of differences in perceptions that exist between different types of health professionals. METHODS: Students at a medical University enrolled in MD, DVM, DVM MPH and MD MPH programs, were invited to complete the standardized Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS), which consists of 19 Likert scale items measuring concepts relating to teamwork, professional identity and roles and responsibilities. A total of 364 students across the four programs took part. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed to assess differences between the programmes. RESULTS: Results indicate that MD students score lower on the different RIPLS items compared to DVM, MD MPH and DVM MPH students. DVM and DVM MPH students are generally more positive about the need for teamwork, while MD MPH and DVM MPH students have a stronger positive identity about the need for IPE. CONCLUSIONS: The findings drawn from this study suggests that the MD students keep on seeing themselves as a separate group of health professionals in their own right. In order to guarantee an increased level of understanding on issues relating to the human-animal-environmental spectrum, medical curricula might benefit from the incorporation of shared learning and teamwork, as occurs within the MPH, enabling students to appreciate the value of interprofessional collaboration to their future practice. This is especially important during a time at which human-animal-environmental issues are affecting social and economic life worldwide.","Roopnarine, Rohini; Boeren, Ellen",PLoS One,371,20

Though phosphatidylserine (PS) is the best recognized general recognition ligand till date, recent studies have shown that PS by itself is not sufficient for clearance of apoptotic cells. In this study, we have identified a specific pleioform of GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) that functions as an ‘eat me’ signal on apoptotic cell surface. This specific form of GAPDH which is exposed on surface of apoptotic cells was found to interact with CD14 present on plasma membrane of phagocytes leading to their engulfment. This is the first study demonstrating the novel interaction between multifunctional GAPDH and the phagocytic receptor CD14 resulting in apoptotic cell clearance (efferocytosis).","Chaudhary, Surbhi; Patidar, Anil; Dhiman, Asmita; Chaubey, Gaurav Kumar; Dilawari, Rahul; Talukdar, Sharmila; Modanwal, Radheshyam; Raje, Manoj",Cell Death Dis,371,18

This study provides a super learner ensemble of models for predicting COVID-19 severity among these patients. METHOD: The Cerner Real-World Database was used for this study. Data on adult patients (18 years or older) with cardiovascular and related circulatory diseases between 2017 and 2019 were retrieved and a total of 13 these conditions were identified. Among these patients, 33,042 admitted with positive diagnoses for COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2020 (from 59 hospitals) were identified and selected for this study. A total of 14 statistical and machine learning models were developed and combined into a single more powerful super learning model for predicting COVID-19 severity on admission to the hospital. RESULT: LASSO regression, a full extreme gradient boosting model with tree depth of 2, and a full logistic regression model were the most predictive with cross-validated AUROCs of 0.7964, 0.7961, and 0.7958 respectively. The resulting super learner ensemble model had a cross validated AUROC of 0.8006 (range: 0.7814, 0.8163). The unbiased AUROC of the super learner model on an independent test set was 0.8057 (95% CI: 0.7954, 0.8159).

Simulations revealed dramatic infectivity driven by undocumented infections, and a peak basic reproductive number in NYS of 5.7. NPIs have been effective, and relaxation >50% will result in tens-of-thousands more deaths. Endemic infection is likely to occur in the absence of profound sustained immunity.

We reported here a new method for sequence comparison. It considers whole distribution of dual bases and employs polar coordinates method to map a biological sequence into a closed curve. The curve tree was then constructed to numerically characterize the closed curve of biological sequences, and further compared biological sequences by evaluating the distance of the curve tree of the query sequence matching against a corresponding curve tree of the template sequence. The proposed method was tested by phylogenetic analysis, and its performance was further compared with alignment-based methods. The results demonstrate that using polar coordinates representation and curve tree to compare sequences is more efficient.","Dai, Qi; Guo, Xiaodong; Li, Lihua",J Theor Biol,371,9

The overall incidence of HMPV infection amongst an all-ages population of patients hospitalised with ALRI in Cambodia during 3 consecutive years, between 2007 and 2009, was 1.7%. The incidence of HMPV infection was highest amongst children less than 5 years of age, with pneumonia or bronchopneumonia the most frequent clinical diagnoses across all age groups. The incidence of HMPV infection varied annually.

Many COVID -19 positive patients had to stay at home and reach out to their family physicians for guidance. This gave us an opportunity to observe a group of patients in home quarantine. The challenge was daunting. We could not afford to allow these patients to deteriorate as hospital beds and oxygen support were not readily available. Therefore, we developed an innovative approach to monitor these patients and to intervene at the optimal time to avoid hospitalization. Based on objective biochemical tests like elevated CRP and clinical signs like persistent high-grade fever, we initiated early low dose steroids and antibiotics prior to the onset of hypoxia. None of the home quarantined patients deteriorated because of the timely medical intervention. These patients neither required oxygen support nor hospitalization. We therefore present our new treatment model for home quarantined COVID-19 patients along with our suggestions for implementing the model at the community level. Methods: 25 patients under home quarantine who contacted online for medical guidance underwent clinical and biochemical evaluation. CT radiological examination was done whenever indicated. Treatments were initiated under medical guidance based on the CRP values and clinical presentation. Results: Among the 25 patients, 40% of the patients (10/25) had mild symptoms with normal CRP. 24% of the patients (6/25) had mild symptoms with elevated CRP. 36% of patients (9/25) had elevated CRP with persistent high fever. All the 25 patients recovered over the next four weeks. Conclusion: We propose an early objective assessment of inflammatory markers like CRP prior to the onset of hypoxia during home quarantine and early, need-based intervention under medical guidance to avoid complications and hospitalization.

Virus-mediated injury to multiple organs, mainly the respiratory tract, activation of immune response with the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and overactivation of the coagulation cascade and platelet aggregation leading to micro- and macrovascular thrombosis are the main pathological features of COVID-19. Empirical multidrug therapeutic approaches to treat COVID-19 are currently used with extremely uncertain outcomes, and many others are being tested in clinical trials. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has both anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects. In addition, a significant ASA-mediated antiviral activity against DNA and RNA viruses, including different human coronaviruses, has been documented. The use of ASA in patients with different types of infections has been associated with reduced thrombo-inflammation and lower rates of clinical complications and in-hospital mortality. However, safety issues related both to the risk of bleeding and to that of developing rare but serious liver and brain damage mostly among children (i.e., Reye’s syndrome) should be considered. Hence, whether ASA might be a safe and reasonable therapeutic candidate to be tested in clinical trials involving adults with COVID-19 deserves further attention.

This study was conducted using a combination of solicited audio and written diaries, photography, and in-depth interviews with 16 participants, aged 22 to 58. The article provides a critical reflection on the incentives and deterrents to the UGS use of participants while social distancing measures were in place. The results show that in Mexico City: (1) participants’ lack of access to UGS has hampered their use, mainly among those of low-income neighborhoods; (2) UGS size did not directly impact participants’ UGS use during the pandemic; and (3) women were deterred from accessing UGS due to safety concerns related to the fear of violence. Overall, the results suggest that UGS use has served as a coping mechanism to decrease the effects of stress and isolation caused by the pandemic, increasing users’ physical and mental well-being. This study’s conclusions can help develop future citizen participation tools that are useful for resilience in urban design, as they provide interesting insights into the perceptions of residents, such as the most valued characteristics of UGS.","Mayen Huerta, Carolina; Cafagna, Gianluca",Int J Environ Res Public Health,371,16

According to models of self-regulated learning, we propose a model for the usage of SETs as a learning situation. In a longitudinal study, we investigate the associations between achievement goals and the usage of and learning from SETs in the context of higher education. In total, 407 higher education instructors (46.4% female; 38.60 years on average) with teaching commitments in Germany or Austria reported their achievement goals in an online survey. Out of these participants, 152 instructors voluntarily conducted SET(s) and subsequently reported their intentions to act on the feedback and improve future teaching in a short survey. Using structural equation modeling, we found, in line with our hypotheses, that learning avoidance, appearance approach, and appearance avoidance goals predicted whether instructors voluntarily conducted SET(s). As expected, learning approach and (avoidance) goals were positively associated with intentions to act on received SET-results and improve future teaching. These findings support our hypotheses, are in line with assumptions of self-regulated learning models, and highlight the importance of achievement goals for instructors’ voluntary usage of and intended learning from SET(s). To facilitate instructors’ learning from SET-results, our study constitutes a first step for future intervention studies to build on. Future researchers and practitioners might support instructors’ professional learning by encouraging them to reflect on their SET-results.","Hein, Julia; Janke, Stefan; Rinas, Raven; Daumiller, Martin; Dresel, Markus; Dickhäuser, Oliver",Front Psychol,371,11

Increasing rates of new syphilis cases per year have been observed recently. RESULTS: The genome of the SS14 strain was sequenced to high accuracy by an oligonucleotide array strategy requiring hybridization to only three arrays (Comparative Genome Sequencing, CGS). Gaps in the resulting sequence were filled with targeted dideoxy-terminators (DDT) sequencing and the sequence was confirmed by whole genome fingerprinting (WGF). When compared to the Nichols strain, 327 single nucleotide substitutions (224 transitions, 103 transversions), 14 deletions, and 18 insertions were found. On the proteome level, the highest frequency of amino acid-altering substitution polymorphisms was in novel genes, while the lowest was in housekeeping genes, as expected by their evolutionary conservation. Evidence was also found for hypervariable regions and multiple regions showing intrastrain heterogeneity in the T. pallidum chromosome. CONCLUSION: The observed genetic changes do not have influence on the ability of Treponema pallidum to cause syphilitic infection, since both SS14 and Nichols are virulent in rabbit. However, this is the first assessment of the degree of variation between the two syphilis pathogens and paves the way for phylogenetic studies of this fascinating organism.","Matějková, Petra; Strouhal, Michal; Šmajs, David; Norris, Steven J; Palzkill, Timothy; Petrosino, Joseph F; Sodergren, Erica; Norton, Jason E; Singh, Jaz; Richmond, Todd A; Molla, Michael N; Albert, Thomas J; Weinstock, George M",BMC Microbiol,371,16

METHODS: We surveyed approximately n=1,000 Austrian residents in 12 waves between April and December 2020 (n=12,029). Outcomes were suicidality (Beck Suicidal Ideation Scale), depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale), and domestic violence. We also assessed the perceived burden from the pandemic. Demographic and Covid-19 specific occupational and morbidity-related variables were used to explain outcomes in multivariable regression analyses, controlling for well-established risk factors of mental ill-health, and variations over time were analyzed. RESULTS: Young age, working in healthcare or from home, and own Covid-19 illness were consistent risk factors controlling for a wide range of known mental health risk factors. Time patterns in the perceived burden from Covid-19-related measures were consistent with the time sequence of restrictions and relaxations of governmental measures. Depression and anxiety were relatively stable over time, with some increase of depression during the second phase of lockdowns. Domestic violence increased immediately after both hard lockdowns. Suicidal ideation decreased slightly over time, with a low during the second hard lockdown. Mental health indicators for women and young people showed some deterioration over time, whereas those reporting own Covid-19 illness improved. LIMITATIONS: Data from before the pandemic were not available. CONCLUSIONS: Among mental health outcomes, increases in domestic violence and, to some smaller extent, depressive symptoms, appeared most closely related to the timing of hard lockdowns. Healthcare staff, individuals working from home, those with Covid-19, as well as young people and women are non-traditional risk groups who warrant heightened attention in prevention during and in the aftermath of the pandemic.

Moreover, the prognosis of the disease seems to be worse in immunocompromised patients when compared to the general population, with 4–5 times higher mortality rates. However, the overall impact on long-term function of the kidney graft is unknown. We report on a case of a 46-year-old kidney transplant recipient who was successfully treated for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The clinical course was complicated by transient acute kidney injury, most likely due to tubulo-interstitial involvement, with return to the baseline of the creatinine level by the time of discharge. We discuss the characteristics and differential diagnosis of acute kidney injury, as well as management of immunosuppression in connection with overall clinical status and evolution of kidney function. The case is illustrative for dilemmas that transplant professionals may face in the absence of evidence-based, efficient COVID-19 therapy. The risk-benefit balance of the yet to be approved treatment strategies may be weighed differently in organ transplant recipients owing to their immunocompromised status and potential drug interactions with immunosuppressive therapy.","Tosa, Flaviu; Manaila, Roxana; Elec, Alina; Moisoiu, Tudor; Ghervan, Liviu; Elec, Florin",Case Rep Nephrol Dial,371,28

It includes patients with the recently described immune-mediated necrotizing myopathies (IMNM) who have specific antibodies, such as anti-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase or anti-signal recognition particle, seronegative phenotypes that can be associated with cancer, and other types of myositis and connective tissue diseases involving necrotic muscle fibers as a characteristic pathologic feature. Necrotizing myopathies that are not immune-mediated, such as those caused by drugs, dystrophies, infections, or even hypothyroidism are also included. The purpose of this review is to address the differential diagnosis of these disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: New IMNM have been described over the last few years, some of them related with checkpoint inhibitors, drugs that are being increasingly used in cancer treatment. Necrotizing myopathy has also been reported in association with specific phenotypes and autoantibodies (e.g. anti-Mi2 dermatomyositis, antisynthetase syndrome, and myositis associated with antimitochondrial antibodies). Rarer cases associated with graft-versus-host disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection are also emerging. SUMMARY: Differentiation between patients with IMNM and those without the superimposed autoimmune phenomena helps clinicians determine the best individualized approach to use and the appropriate immunosuppressive therapy, whenever needed.","Selva-O'Callaghan, Albert; Trallero-Araguás, Ernesto; Milisenda, Jose C; Grau-Junyent, Josep M",Curr Opin Rheumatol,371,1

Weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random or fixed-effects models. Results A total of 16 studies comprising of 3962 patients with COVID-19 were included in our analysis. Random-effect results demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 in nonsevere group had lower levels for CRP (WMD = -41.78 mg/l, 95% CI = [-52.43, -31.13], P < 0.001), PCT (WMD = -0.13 ng/ml, 95% CI = [-0.20, -0.05], P < 0.001), IL-6 (WMD = -21.32 ng/l, 95% CI = [-28.34, -14.31], P < 0.001), ESR (WMD = −8 mm/h, 95% CI = [-14, -2], P = 0.005), SAA (WMD = -43.35 μg/ml, 95% CI = [-80.85, -5.85], P = 0.020) and serum ferritin (WMD = -398.80 mg/l, 95% CI = [-625.89, -171.71], P < 0.001), compared with those in severe group.

In the last decade, numerous studies have been proposed using artificial intelligence techniques to predict the risk of developing SiNCDs. However, determining the most significant features and developing interpretable models are rather challenging in such systems. In this study, we propose an efficient extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) based framework incorporated with the hybrid feature selection (HFS) method for SiNCDs prediction among the general population in South Korea and the United States. Initially, HFS is performed in three stages: (I) significant features are selected by t-test and chi-square test; (II) multicollinearity analysis serves to obtain dissimilar features; (III) final selection of best representative features is done based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Then, selected features are fed into the XGBoost predictive model. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms several existing baseline models. In addition, the proposed model also provides important features in order to enhance the interpretability of the SiNCDs prediction model. Consequently, the XGBoost based framework is expected to contribute for early diagnosis and prevention of the SiNCDs in public health concerns.","Davagdorj, Khishigsuren; Pham, Van Huy; Theera-Umpon, Nipon; Ryu, Keun Ho",Int J Environ Res Public Health,371,16

The transcription factor, nuclear factor-κ-B (NFκB) is a key inflammatory player that is antagonized via anti-inflammatory actions exerted by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). However, technical limitations have restricted our understanding of how GR is involved in the dynamics of NFκB in vivo. In this study, we used an improved lentiviral-based reporter to elucidate the time course of NFκB and GR activities during behavioral changes from sickness to depression induced by a systemic lipopolysaccharide challenge. The trajectory of NFκB activity established a behavioral basis for the NFκB signal transition involved in three phases, sickness-early-phase, normal-middle-phase, and depressive-like-late-phase. The temporal shift in brain GR activity was differentially involved in the transition of NFκB signals during the normal and depressive-like phases. The middle-phase GR effectively inhibited NFκB in a glucocorticoid-dependent manner, but the late-phase GR had no inhibitory action. Furthermore, we revealed the cryptic role of basal GR activity in the early NFκB signal transition, as evidenced by the fact that blocking GR activity with RU486 led to early depressive-like episodes through the emergence of the brain NFκB activity. These results highlight the inhibitory action of GR on NFκB by the basal and activated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis during body-to-brain inflammatory spread, providing clues about molecular mechanisms underlying systemic inflammation caused by such as COVID-19 infection, leading to depression.","Han, Young-Min; Kim, Min Sun; Jo, Juyeong; Shin, Daiha; Kwon, Seung-Hae; SEO, Jong Bok; Kang, Dongmin; Lee, Byoung Dae; Ryu, Hoon; Hwang, Eun Mi; Kim, Jae-Min; Patel, Paresh D.; Lyons, David M.; Schatzberg, Alan F.; Her, Song",Mol Psychiatry,371,12

The objective of this study was to evaluate the factors associated with psychological distress among medical students during the period of enforced home quarantine from March through May 2020. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: One Japanese medical school. PARTICIPANTS: 571 medical students. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-administered electronic questionnaires including the K-6 scale for psychological distress, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) for self-esteem and the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) for self-efficacy were distributed. To assess the determinant factor for psychological distress, variables such as sex, grade in school, living conditions, and RSES and GSES scores were evaluated in regression analysis. RESULTS: 163 respondents (28.5%) scored ≥5 on the K-6 scale, indicating a significant degree of psychological distress. Logistic regression revealed that a higher score on RSES (p<0.001) and GSES (p<0.01) was an independent factor associated with lower levels of psychological distress. Multiple regression analysis focusing on students with a K-6 score ≥5 revealed that higher scores on RSES correlated with lower levels of psychological distress. By contrast, those with higher GSES scores also scored higher for indicators of psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified that self-efficacy and self-esteem were both influential factors for predicting psychological distress during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Medical schools should provide support for mental health and educational initiatives directed at enhancing self-esteem and self-efficacy, with a focus on improving personal resilience. In emergency situations, such as that faced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, initial programmes might target students with higher levels of self-efficacy. By contrast, under routine situations, these efforts should be directed towards students with lower self-esteem as primary means to prevent depression.","Arima, Makiko; Takamiya, Yusuke; Furuta, Atsuko; Siriratsivawong, Kris; Tsuchiya, Shizuma; Izumi, Miki",BMJ Open,371,29

At the peak, the daily census exceeded 200 patients with COVID 19. Surveillance for healthcare acquired infections (HAIs) continued throughout this time. Despite the acuity of the patients and the frequent use of antibiotics, the rates of Clostridioides difficile lab ID (CDI) events remained relatively stable. We sought to determine the validity of this rate. Methods To determine if cases of CDI were missed, we compared the 3-month rate per 10,000 patient days in 2020 to the same time-period in 2019 (March, April, and May). The number of tests ordered during the two periods was also compared. Additionally, the Doctor of Pharmacy from our antibiotic stewardship team reviewed all orders for oral Vancomycin to determine if empiric CDI treatment was initiated without confirmatory testing. Results The CDI rate for the 3 months in 2019 was zero compared to 0.48 per 10,000 patient days during the peak of the pandemic. The number of tests increased in the 2020 period to 17.5 per 10,000 patient days versus 15.8 in the 2019 period. Three patients received oral Vancomycin, each of whom had valid indications. Conclusions Based on this data, CDI cases were not underreported. We speculate that the lack of an increase in CDI rates may be attributed to: Increased hand hygiene by staff – compliance increased to 91 % in 2020 compared to 83 % in 2019,enhanced attention to cleaning and high level disinfection, and Improved adherence to use of personal protective equipment.","Smith, Barbara A.; Kim, Kilyoub; Yassin, Arsheena; Camins, Bernard; Gottlieb, Lindsey",American Journal of Infection Control,371,16

World Health Organization recommends local production of ABHR solution in healthcare settings which provides a feasible alternative to the use of relatively expensive commercially produced hand sanitizers. The aim of this study was to explore the adequacy of ABHR solution production practice in response to COVID-19 in public hospitals of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was applied using assessment checklist for evaluation of the adequacy of ABHR production practice in compounding units of public hospitals. The evaluation was done with regard to the standard requirements as per the checklist. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23 was used for data entry and analysis. Descriptive statistics was employed for analyses of data and categorical variables were described by frequencies and percentages. RESULTS: Out of the 13 public hospitals observed in the study, 11 facilities had dedicated premises for compounding of ABHR solution. Seven facilities determined the concentration of ethanol in ABHR solution using alcoholmeters. Only one health facility had a titration kit and performed a strength test for the hydrogen peroxide raw material. Thermal and chemical disinfection processes were practiced for cleaning of recycled dispensing bottles only in 3 and 2 hospitals, respectively. Most of the hospitals (11 facilities) had standard operating procedures (SOPs) for production, but the majority lack SOPs for beyond-use-date assignment (11 facilities), premise and equipment cleaning (12 facilities), and disinfection of recycled bottles (12 facilities). CONCLUSION: Most hospitals have fulfilled the majority requirements of premises required for compounding of ABHR solution in their facilities. Five hospitals did not verify the concentration of ethanol in the ABHR solution which might affect the effectiveness of the product. Generally, lower compliance of the majority studied hospitals to good compounding practice was observed during ABHR solution production especially for product preparation, quality control, and documentation.

Identifying risk factors of severity aids in assessment for the need of early hospitalization. We aimed to demonstrate, for the first time, the clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, to identify the predictors of severity and to describe the antimicrobial resistance profile in patients from Upper Egypt. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic characters, clinical presentations, laboratory, and radiological data were recorded and analyzed. Presence of other respiratory microorganisms and their sensitivity patterns were identified using the VITEK2 system. Resistance-associated genes were tested by PCR. RESULTS: The study included 260 COVID-19 patients. The majority were males (55.4%) aged between 51 and 70 years. Hypertension, diabetes, and ischemic heart disease were common comorbidities. Main clinical manifestations were fever (63.8%), cough (57.7%), dyspnea (40%) and fatigue (30%). According to severity, 51.5% were moderate, 25.4% mild and 23% severe/critical. Lymphopenia, elevated CRP, ferritin, and D-dimer occurred in all patients with significantly higher value in the severe group. Age >53 years and elevated ferritin ≥484 ng/mL were significant risk factors for severity. About 10.7% of the COVID-19 patients showed bacterial and/or fungal infections. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Staphylococcus aureus were the predominant isolated bacteria while Candida albicans and Candida glabrata were the predominant isolated fungi. All Staphylococci were methicillin-resistant and carried the mecA gene. Gram-negative isolates were multidrug-resistant and carried different resistance-associated genes, including NDM-1, KPC, TEM, CTX-M, and SHV. CONCLUSION: Older age and elevated serum ferritin were significant risk factors for severe COVID-19. Bacterial co-infection and multidrug resistance among patients with COVID-19 in Upper Egypt is common. Testing for presence of other co-infecting agents should be considered, and prompt treatment should be carried out according to the antimicrobial sensitivity reports.","Ramadan, Haidi Karam-Allah; Mahmoud, Manal A; Aburahma, Mohamed Zakaria; Elkhawaga, Amal A; El-Mokhtar, Mohamed A; Sayed, Ibrahim M; Hosni, Amal; Hassany, Sahar M; Medhat, Mohammed A",Infect Drug Resist,371,24

The Delphi study, a qualitative research methodology, which provides the focus for this article, had the overall aim of exploring existing successful strategies to support YCs. Compared to YCs, even less is known about adolescent young carers (AYCs), a group that is in a critical life transition phase. The study forms part of an EU Horizon 2020 funded research project on AYCs aged 15–17 years old. METHODS: A two-round Delphi study was conducted with 66 experts on YCs from 10 European countries. Topics included: (i) visibility and awareness-raising of YCs at local, regional, and national levels, (ii) current interventions to support YCs, and (iii) future strategies to support YCs. RESULTS: Experts reported a lack of visibility and awareness about YCs in general, and AYCs in particular. Although awareness is slowly increasing in most countries, with the UK ranked highest, experts acknowledged that it remains challenging to identify YCs in many countries. Furthermore, the level and type of support available for YCs differs, with most countries mainly offering support on a local level. Diverse views were expressed regarding future strategies to support YCs. Experts highlighted the importance of specific legislation to formalise the rights of YCs, and the issue of whether young people should be safeguarded from caregiving or if this should be considered part of regular family life. They also emphasised the relevance of available integrated support services for YCs, including schools, family, health and social care. CONCLUSIONS: In most European countries, there is a lack of awareness and visibility on YCs. Identification of YCs is a crucial first step and there is need for a common definition of YCs, together with greater opportunities for young adults to identify themselves as YCs.","Nap, Henk Herman; Hoefman, Renske; de Jong, Nynke; Lovink, Lieke; Glimmerveen, Ludo; Lewis, Feylyn; Santini, Sara; D’Amen, Barbara; Socci, Marco; Boccaletti, Licia; Casu, Giulia; Manattini, Alessandra; Brolin, Rosita; Sirk, Karina; Hlebec, Valentina; Rakar, Tatjana; Hudobivnik, Tjasa; Leu, Agnes; Berger, Fabian; Magnusson, Lennart; Hanson, Elizabeth",BMC Health Serv Res,371,16

Moreover, two consecutive slow codons (slow di-codons) lead to a much slower translation rate. Calculating the composition of host specific slow codons and slow di-codons in the viral protein coding sequences can predict the order of viral protein synthesis rates between different virus strains. Comparison of human-specific slow codon and slow di-codon compositions in the genomes of 590 coronaviruses infect humans revealed that the protein synthetic rates of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) may be much faster than other coronaviruses infect humans. Analysis of host-specific slow codon and di-codon compositions provides links between viral genomic sequences and capability of virus replication in host cells that may be useful for surveillance of the transmission potential of novel viruses.","Yang, Chu-Wen; Chen, Mei-Fang",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,371,8

The reported incidence rates of thrombotic complications in hospitalized COVID‐19 patients vary between 2.6 and 85% (both in non‐critically ill and critically ill patients). The risk of venous thromboembolism is not known in non‐hospitalized patients with COVID‐19. There are numerous studies and guidelines for administration of thromboprophylaxis for COVID‐19 cases. All hospitalized COVID‐19 patients should take pharmacological thromboprophylaxis if there is no contraindication. However, there is no consensus on this issue.

Several logistical and infrastructure challenges limit access to SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing. Dried blood spot (DBS) samples have been used for serology testing of various diseases in resource-limited settings. We examined the use of DBS samples and capillary blood (fingerstick) plasma collected in Microtainer tubes for SARS-CoV-2 testing with the automated Abbott ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG (List 6R86) and IgM assays and use of venous whole blood with a prototype PANBIO rapid point-of-care lateral flow SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. The ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay was initially optimized for use with DBS, venous and capillary plasma, and venous whole blood collected from patients with symptoms and PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and negative asymptomatic controls. Assay linearity and reproducibility was confirmed with 3 contrived DBS samples, with sample stability and signal recovery after 14 days at room temperature. ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM assay results showed high concordance between fingerstick DBS and venous DBS samples, and between fingerstick DBS and venous whole blood samples (n=61). Discordant results were seen in 3 participants (2 IgG, 1 IgM) who were in the process of seroreversion at the time of sample collection and had results near the assay cutoff. Use of fingerstick plasma collected in Microtainer tubes (n=109) showed 100% concordant results (R2=0.997) with matched patient venous plasma on the ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. High concordance of assay results (92.9% positive, 100% negative) was also observed for the PANBIO SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay compared to the ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay run with matched venous plasma (n=61). Fingerstick DBS and plasma samples are easy and inexpensive to collect and, along with the use of rapid point-of-care testing platforms, will expand access to SARS-CoV-2 serology testing, particularly in resource-limited areas.","Anderson, M.

We developed a machine learning algorithm, based on a deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), for continuous management of oxygen flow rate for critical ill patients under intensive care, which can identify the optimal personalized oxygen flow rate with strong potentials to reduce mortality rate relative to the current clinical practice. METHODS: We modeled the oxygen flow trajectory of COVID-19 patients and their health outcomes as a Markov decision process. Based on individual patient characteristics and health status, a reinforcement learning based oxygen control policy is learned and real-time recommends the oxygen flow rate to reduce the mortality rate. We assessed the performance of proposed methods through cross validation by using a retrospective cohort of 1,372 critically ill patients with COVID-19 from New York University Langone Health ambulatory care with electronic health records from April 2020 to January 2021. RESULTS: The mean mortality rate under the RL algorithm is lower than standard of care by 2.57% (95% CI: 2.08–3.06) reduction (P<0.001) from 7.94% under the standard of care to 5.37 % under our algorithm and the averaged recommended oxygen flow rate is 1.28 L/min (95% CI: 1.14–1.42) lower than the rate actually delivered to patients. Thus, the RL algorithm could potentially lead to better intensive care treatment that can reduce mortality rate, while saving the oxygen scarce resources. It can reduce the oxygen shortage issue and improve public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: A personalized reinforcement learning oxygen flow control algorithm for COVID-19 patients under intensive care showed substantial reduction in 7-day mortality rate as compared to standard of care. In the overall cross validation cohort independent of the training data, mortality was lowest in patients for whom intensivists’ actual flow rate matched the RL decisions.","Zheng, Hua; Zhu, Jiahao; Xie, Wei; Zhong, Judy",ArXiv,371,20

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the number of potentially infectious particles present during endoscopic procedures and find effective tools to eliminate the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection while performing them. METHODS: An experimental model which focused on aerosol problematics was made in a specialized laboratory. This model simulated conditions present during endoscopic procedures and monitored the formation of potentially infectious fluid particles from the patient’s body, which pass through the endoscope and are then released into the environment. For this reason, we designed and tested a prototype of a protective cover for the endoscope’s control body to prevent the release and spread of these fluid particles from its working channel. We performed measurements with and without the protective cover of the endoscope’s control body. RESULTS: It was found that liquid coming through the working channel of the endoscope with forceps or other instruments inside generates droplets with a diameter in the range of 0.1–1.1 mm and an initial velocity of up to 0.9 m/s. The average number of particles per measurement per whole measured area without a protective cover on the endoscope control body was 51.1; with this protective cover on, the measurement was 0.0, p<0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: Our measurements proved that fluid particles are released from the working channel of an endoscope when forceps are inserted. A special protective cover for the endoscope control body, made out of breathable material (surgical cap) and designed by our team, was found to eliminate this release of potentially infectious fluid particles.","Keil, Radan; Hlava, Štěpán; Stanovský, Petr; Ždímal, Vladimír; Šťovíček, Jan; Trojánek, Milan; Drábek, Jiří; Frýbová, Barbora; Petráček, Vojtěch; Wasserbauer, Martin",PLoS One,371,26

Multiple GI symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea or vomiting and abdominal pain, have also been reported. This review aims to present the currently available data regarding the GI symptoms of COVID-19 patients, and to compare the frequency of GI symptoms in early stage (Eastern) mostly Chinese data to the current stage (Western) non-Chinese data. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search to identify both published studies by using PubMed, Google Scholar, and CNKI (Chinese medical search engine), and yet unpublished studies through medRxiv and bioRxiv. We also reviewed the cross references of the detected articles. We conducted a Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) search up until 20 September 2020. We pooled the prevalence of symptoms of diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain by using the Freeman–Tukey’s transforming random effect model. Results: A total of 118 studies were included in the systematic review and 44 of them were included in the meta-analysis. There was a significant heterogeneity between the studies; therefore, the random effects model was used. The pooled prevalence estimate of any GI symptoms reported was found to be 0.21 (95%CI, 0.16–0.27). Anorexia was the most commonly reported GI symptom at 18% (95%CI, 0.10–0.27) followed by diarrhea at 15% (95%CI, 0.12–0.19). Diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and respiratory symptoms were more common in non-Chinese studies. The prevalence of abdominal pain was lower in the “inpatient-only” studies when compared with studies that included outpatients only and those including both inpatients and outpatients. Conclusions: In this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis study, we observed higher rates of diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain in COVID-19 infected patients among non-Chinese studies compared to Chinese studies. We also observed a higher prevalence of GI symptoms in Chinese studies than was reported previously. Non-respiratory symptoms, including GI tract symptoms, should be more thoroughly and carefully evaluated and reported in future studies.","Akin, Hakan; Kurt, Ramazan; Tufan, Fatih; Swi, Ahmed; Ozaras, Resat; Tahan, Veysel; Hammoud, Ghassan",Diseases,371,0

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Italy. PARTICIPANTS: We analysed 2992 subjects (mean age 57·9 ± 15·3 years, 40·4 % men). Individual participant data were pooled from two retrospective cohorts: (1) The Moli-LOCK cohort consists of 1501 adults, a portion of the larger Moli-sani study (n 24 325; 2005–2010) who were administered a phone-based questionnaire to assess lifestyles and psychological factors during confinement and (2) the Analysis of Long Term Risk of Covid-19 Emergency is a web-based survey of 1491 individuals distributed throughout Italy who self-responded to the same questionnaire by using Google forms. UPF was defined according to NOVA classification based on degree of food processing. An UPF score was created by assigning 1 point to increased consumption, −1 to decreased and 0 point for unchanged intakes of nineteen food items, with higher values indicating an increase in UPF during confinement. RESULTS: Overall, 37·5 % of the population reported some increase in UPF (UPF score ≥1). Adults were more likely to decrease UPF (multivariable regression coefficient β = −1·94; 95 % CI −2·72, −1·17 for individuals aged >75 years as compared with 18–39 years) as did individuals from southern Italian regions as compared with Northern inhabitants (β = −1·32; 95 % CI −1·80, −0·84), while UPF lowering associated with increased exercise (β = −0·90; 95 % CI −1·46, −0·35) and weight loss (β = −1·05; 95 % CI −1·51, −0·59) during confinement.

Recent cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) of nodavirus RNA replication complexes revealed that the viral double-stranded RNA replication template is coiled inside a 30- to 90-nm invagination of the outer mitochondrial membrane, whose necked aperture to the cytoplasm is gated by a 12-fold symmetric, 35-nm diameter “crown” complex that contains multifunctional viral RNA replication protein A. Here we report optimizing cryo-EM tomography and image processing to improve crown resolution from 33 to 8.5 Å. This resolves the crown into 12 distinct vertical segments, each with 3 major subdomains: A membrane-connected basal lobe and an apical lobe that together comprise the ∼19-nm-diameter central turret, and a leg emerging from the basal lobe that connects to the membrane at ∼35-nm diameter. Despite widely varying replication vesicle diameters, the resulting two rings of membrane interaction sites constrain the vesicle neck to a highly uniform shape. Labeling protein A with a His-tag that binds 5-nm Ni-nanogold allowed cryo-EM tomography mapping of the C terminus of protein A to the apical lobe, which correlates well with the predicted structure of the C-proximal polymerase domain of protein A. These and other results indicate that the crown contains 12 copies of protein A arranged basally to apically in an N-to-C orientation. Moreover, the apical polymerase localization has significant mechanistic implications for template RNA recruitment and (−) and (+)RNA synthesis.","Unchwaniwala, Nuruddin; Zhan, Hong; Pennington, Janice; Horswill, Mark; den Boon, Johan A.; Ahlquist, Paul",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,371,1

Methods: This cross-sectional study was based on an Internet monitoring survey conducted during the third wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan. Of the 33,302 people who participated in the survey, 27,036 were included in the analyses. Participants answered whether or not each of 10 different infection control measures were in place at their workplace (e.g. wearing masks at all times during working hours). A Kessler 6 (K6) score of [≥]5 was defined as mild psychological distress. The odds ratios (ORs) of psychological distress associated with infection control measures at the workplace were estimated using a multilevel logistic model nested in the prefectures of residence. Results: The OR of subjects working at facilities with 4 or 5 infection control measures was 1.15 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.29, p=0.025), that in facilities with 2 or 3 infection control measures was 1.32 (95% CI: 1.15-1.50, p<0.001), and that in facilities with 1 or no infection control measures was 1.48 (95% CI: 1.30-1.68, p<0.001) compared to subjects whose workplaces had [≥]6 infection control measures. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that proactive COVID-19 infection control measures can influence the mental health of workers.","Yasuda, Y.; Ishimaru, T.; Tateishi, S.; Eguchi, H.; Tsuji, M.; Ogami, A.; Mori, K.; Matsuda, S.; Fujino, Y.",,371,20

These medicines, essential to palliative care, are regulated under the international drug control conventions overseen by United Nations (UN) specialized agencies and treaty bodies and under national drug control laws. Those national laws and regulations directly affect bedside availability of Internationally Controlled Essential Medicines (ICEMs). The complex interaction between national regulatory systems and global supply chains (now impacted by COVID-19 pandemic) directly affects bedside availability of ICEMs and patient care. Despite decades of global civil society advocacy in the UN system, ICEMs have remained chronically unavailable, inaccessible and unaffordable in Lower-and-Middle Income Countries, and there are recent reports of shortages in High Income Countries as well. The most prevalent symptoms in COVID-19 are breathlessness, cough, drowsiness, anxiety, agitation and delirium. Frequently used medicines include opioids such as morphine or fentanyl and midazolam, all of them listed as ICEMs. This paper describes the issues related to the lack of availability and limited access to ICEMs during the COVID-19 pandemic in both intensive and palliative care patients in countries of all income levels and makes recommendations for improving access.","Pettus, Katherine; Cleary, James F.; de Lima, Liliana; Ahmed, Ebtesam; Radbruch, Lukas",J Pain Symptom Manage,371,30

Frameshifting is induced by mRNA secondary structures that compromise ribosome fidelity during decoding of a heptanucleotide ‘slippery’ sequence. The nsp2 PRF signal of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus is distinctive in directing both −2 and −1 PRF and in its requirement for a trans-acting protein factor, the viral replicase subunit nsp1β. Here we show that the the trans-activation of frameshifting is carried out by a protein complex composed of nsp1β and a cellular poly(C) binding protein (PCBP). From the results of in vitro translation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrate that a PCBP/nsp1β complex binds to a C-rich sequence downstream of the slippery sequence and here mimics the activity of a structured mRNA stimulator of PRF. This is the first description of a role for a trans-acting cellular protein in PRF. The discovery broadens the repertoire of activities associated with poly(C) binding proteins and prototypes a new class of virus–host interactions.","Napthine, Sawsan; Treffers, Emmely E.; Bell, Susanne; Goodfellow, Ian; Fang, Ying; Firth, Andrew E.; Snijder, Eric J.; Brierley, Ian",Nucleic Acids Res,371,24

Design A descriptive and observational study was carried out between September 2010 and September 2017. Setting Pediatric intensive care unit. Patients Infants under one year of age with severe bronchiolitis. Interventions Two periods were compared (2010–14 and 2015–17), corresponding to before and after modification of the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for the management of bronchiolitis in hospital. Main variables Patient sex, age, comorbidities, severity, etiology, administered treatment, bacterial infections, respiratory and inotropic support, length of stay and mortality. Results A total of 706 patients were enrolled, of which 414 (58.6%) males, with a median age of 47 days (IQR 25–100.25). Median bronchiolitis severity score (BROSJOD) upon admission: 9 points (IQR 7–11). Respiratory syncytial virus appeared in 460 (65.16%) patients. The first period (2010–14) included 340 patients and the second period (2015–17) 366 patients. More adrenalin and hypertonic saline nebulizations and more corticosteroid treatment were administered in the second period. More noninvasive ventilation and less conventional mechanical ventilation were used, and less inotropic support was needed, with no significant differences. The antibiotherapy rate decreased significantly (p =0.003). Conclusions Despite the decrease in antibiotherapy, the use of nebulizations and glucocorticoids in these patients should be limited, as recommended by the guide.","Guitart, C.; Alejandre, C.; Torrús, I.; Balaguer, M.; Esteban, E.; Cambra, F.

In this retrospective study, we analyzed in patients with COVID-19 from Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China), who had been died between February 18 and March 25, 2020. Two radiologists analyzed the radiologic characteristics of mobile chest X-ray, and analyzed the serial X-ray changes. Fifty-four deceased patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. We found that 50 (93%) patients with lesions occurred in the bilateral lung, 4 (7%) patients occurred in the right lung, 54 (100%) patients were multifocal involvement. The number of lung fields involved was 42 (78%) patients in 6 fields, 3 (6%) patients in 5 lung fields, 4 (7%) patients in 4 lung fields, and 5 (9%) patients in 3 lung fields. Fifty-three (98%) patients had patchy opacities, 3 (6%) patients had round or oval solid nodules, 9 (17%) patients had fibrous stripes, 13 (24%) patients had pleural effusion, 8 (15%) patients had pleural thickening, 6 (11%) patients had pneumothorax, 3 (6%) patients had subcutaneous emphysema. Among the 24 patients who had serial mobile chest X-rays, 16 (67%) patients had the progression of the lesions, 8 (33%) patients had no significant change of the lesions, and there was no case of reduction of the lesions. The mobile chest X-ray manifestations of deceased patients with COVID-19 were mostly bilateral lung, multifocal involvement, and extensive lung field, and pleural effusion, pleural thickening, and pneumothorax probably could be observed. The serial mobile chest X-ray showed that the chest lesions were progressive with a high probability.","Xiang, Chunlin; Huang, Lu; Xia, Liming",Medicine (Baltimore),371,10

METHODS: Totally 75 COVID‐19 patients admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine from January 22, 2020 to February 29, 2020 were recruited and grouped based on whether or not LPV/r and ARB were jointly used and whether or not Methylprednisolone was used. Indexes including body temperature, time for nucleic acid negative conversion, hospital stays and laboratory indexes were examined and compared. RESULTS: For all patients, there were no significant differences in the change of body temperature, the time for negative conversion and hospital stays whether LPV/r and ARB were jointly used or not. While for severe and critically severe patients, Methylprednisolone noticeably reduced the time for negative conversion. Meanwhile, the clinical efficacy was superior on patients receiving Methylprednisolone within 3 days upon admission, and the duration of hospital stays was much shorter when Methylprednisolone was given at a total dose of 0‐400 mg than a higher dose of >400 mg if all patients received a similar dose per day. Nonetheless, no significant changes across hepatic, renal and myocardial function indexes were observed. CONCLUSION: LPV/r combined with ARB produced no noticeably better effect on COVID‐19 patients relative to the single agent treatment. Additionally, Methylprednisolone was efficient in severe and critically severe cases, and superior efficacy could be realized upon its early, appropriate and short‐term application.

Today the rhetoric surrounding the introduction of new technologies into medicine tends to emphasize that technologies are disturbing relationships, and that the doctor-patient bond reflects a more ‘human’ era of medicine that should be preserved. Using historical studies of pre-modern and modern Western European medicine, this article shows that patient-physician relationships have always been shaped by material cultures. We discuss three activities – recording, examining, and treating – in the light of their historical antecedents, and suggest that the notion of ‘human medicine’ is ever-changing: it consists of social attributions of skills to physicians that played out very differently over the course of history.","Rampton, Vanessa; Böhmer, Maria; Winkler, Anita",J Med Humanit,371,20

To that end, we employ stochastic simulations to model human–fomite interaction with a distinct focus on touchscreen interfaces. The timings and frequency of interactions from within a closed population of infectious and susceptible individuals was modelled using a queuing network. A pseudo-reproductive number R was used to compare outcomes under various parameter conditions. We then apply the simulation to a specific real-world scenario; namely that of airport self-check-in and baggage drop. A counterintuitive result was that R decreased with increased touch rates required for touchscreen interaction. Additionally, as one of few parameters to be controlled, the rate of cleaning/disinfecting screens plays an essential role in mitigating R, though alternative technological strategies could prove more effective. The simulation model developed provides a foundation for future advances in more sophisticated fomite disease-transmission modelling.","Di Battista, Andrew; Nicolaides, Christos; Georgiou, Orestis",Royal Society open science,371,20

For that, we solve the electrostatic problem of a conducting hyperboloid with an elliptical wormhole in the presence of an in-plane electric field. The localized surface plasmons (LSPs) on the NPG sheet, partially hybridized with graphene phonons and surface phonons of the neighboring materials, allow for the control and tuning of the thermal emission spectrum in the wavelength regime from [Formula: see text] to 12 [Formula: see text] m by adjusting the size of and distance between the circular holes in a hexagonal or square lattice structure. Most importantly, the LSPs along with an optical cavity increase the emittance of graphene from about 2.3% for pristine graphene to 80% for NPG, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art pristine graphene light sources operating in the near-infrared by at least a factor of 100. According to our COMSOL calculations, a maximum emission power per area of [Formula: see text] W/[Formula: see text] at [Formula: see text] K for a bias voltage of [Formula: see text] V is achieved by controlling the temperature of the hot electrons through the Joule heating. By generalizing Planck’s theory to any grey body and deriving the completely general nonlocal fluctuation-dissipation theorem with nonlocal response of surface plasmons in the random phase approximation, we show that the coherence length of the graphene plasmons and the thermally emitted photons can be as large as 13 [Formula: see text] m and 150 [Formula: see text] m, respectively, providing the opportunity to create phased arrays made of nanoantennas represented by the holes in NPG. The spatial phase variation of the coherence allows for beamsteering of the thermal emission in the range between [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] by tuning the Fermi energy between [Formula: see text] eV and [Formula: see text] eV through the gate voltage. Our analysis of the nonlocal hydrodynamic response leads to the conjecture that the diffusion length and viscosity in graphene are frequency-dependent. Using finite-difference time domain calculations, coupled mode theory, and RPA, we develop the model of a mid-IR light source based on NPG, which will pave the way to graphene-based optical mid-IR communication, mid-IR color displays, mid-IR spectroscopy, and virus detection.","Shabbir, Muhammad Waqas; Leuenberger, Michael N.",Sci Rep,371,16

We examined their perceptions of the COVID-19 vaccine and implemented an intervention to increase vaccination uptake. DESIGN: Before-and-after trial. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Healthcare personnel at a 790-bed tertiary-care center in Tokyo, Japan. INTERVENTIONS: A prevaccination questionnaire was administered to HCP to examine their perceptions of the COVID-19 vaccine. A multifaceted intervention was then implemented involving (1) distribution of informational leaflets to all HCP, (2) hospital-wide announcements encouraging vaccination, (3) a mandatory lecture, (4) an educational session about the vaccine for pregnant or breastfeeding HCP, and (5) allergy testing for HCP at risk of allergic reactions to the vaccine. A postvaccination survey was also performed. RESULTS: Of 1,575 HCP eligible for enrollment, 1,224 (77.7%) responded to the questionnaire, 533 (43.5%) expressed willingness to be vaccinated, 593 (48.4%) were uncertain, and 98 (8.0%) expressed unwillingness to be vaccinated. The latter 2 groups were concerned about the vaccine’s safety rather than its efficacy. After the intervention, the overall vaccination rate reached 89.7% (1,413 of 1,575), and 88.9% (614 of 691) of the prevaccination survey respondents answered “unwilling” to or “unsure” about eventually receiving a vaccination. In the postvaccination questionnaire, factors contributing to increased COVID-19 vaccination included information and endorsement of vaccination at the medical center (274 of 1,037, 26.4%). CONCLUSIONS: This multifaceted intervention increased COVID-19 vaccinations among HCP at a Japanese hospital. Frequent support and provision of information were crucial for increasing the vaccination rate and may be applicable to the general population as well.","Takamatsu, Akane; Honda, Hitoshi; Kojima, Tomoya; Murata, Kengo; Babcock, Hilary M.",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,371,16

To the best of our knowledge, the evaluation of anxiety state is still based on some subjective questionnaires and there is no objective standard assessment yet. Unlike other methods, our approach focuses on study the neural changes to identify and classify the anxiety state using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. METHODS: We designed a closed neurofeedback experiment that contains three experimental stages to adjust subjects’ mental state. The EEG resting state signal was recorded from thirty-four subjects in the first and third stages while EEG-based mindfulness recording was recorded in the second stage. At the end of each stage, the subjects were asked to fill a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). According to their VAS score, the subjects were classified into three groups: non-anxiety, moderate or severe anxiety groups. RESULTS: After processing the EEG data of each group, support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were able to classify and identify two mental states (non-anxiety and anxiety) using the Power Spectral Density (PSD) as patterns. The highest classification accuracies using Gaussian kernel function and polynomial kernel function are 92.48 ± 1.20% and 88.60 ± 1.32%, respectively. The highest average of the classification accuracies for healthy subjects is 95.31 ± 1.97% and for anxiety subjects is 87.18 ± 3.51%.

However, at the time of initial presentation, most patients’ viral status is unknown. Determination of factors that predict initial and subsequent need for intensive care (ICU) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) are critical for resource planning and allocation. We describe our experience with 4,404 persons under investigation (PUI) and explore predictors of ICU care and IMV at a NY COVID-19 epicenter. Methods We conducted a retrospective COHORT of all persons under investigation (PUI) presenting to a large academic medical center emergency department (ED) in NYS with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. The association between patient predictor variables and SARS-CoV-2 status, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality were explored with univariate and multivariate analyses. Results Between March 12-April 14, 2020 we saw 4,404 PUI patients of whom 68% were discharged home, 29% were admitted to a regular floor and 3% to an ICU. 1,651 of 3,369 patients tested were SARS-CoV-2 positive to date. Of regular floor admits, 13% were subsequently upgraded to the ICU after a median (IQR) of 62 (28-106) hrs. 50 patients required IMV in the ED, 4 required prehospital IMV, and another 167 subsequently required IMV in a median (IQR) of 60 (26-99) hours after admission. Testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and lower oxygen saturations were associated with need for ICU, IMV and death. High respiratory rates were associated with the need for ICU care. Conclusions PUI for COVID-19 contribute significantly to the healthcare burden beyond those ruling in for SARS-CoV-2. For every 100 admitted PUI, 9 will require ICU and/or IMV upon arrival and another 12 within 2-3 days of hospital admission, especially PUIs with lower oxygen saturations and positive SARS-CoV-2 swabs. This information should help hospitals stay ahead of the pandemic curve.","Singer, Adam J.; Morley, Eric J.; Meyers, Kristen; Fernandes, Rafael; Rowe, Alison L.; Viccellio, Peter; Thode, Henry C.; Bracey, Alexander; Henry, Mark C.",Ann Emerg Med,371,26

METHOD: This was a cross-sectional survey among COVID-19 inpatients in two isolation wards of a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from March 7, 2020, to March 24, 2020. Participants’ demographic data, clinical data and levels of circulating inflammatory markers were collated. Mental health symptoms were evaluated with questionnaires, which included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and questions about patients’ self-perceived illness severity. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to explore factors that associated with mental symptoms, and a structural equation model (SEM) was used to assess the possible relationships between those factors and the patients’ mental health. RESULTS: Among the 85 participants, 45.9% had symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 5), 38.8% had anxiety (GAD-7 ≥ 5), and 54.1% had insomnia (ISI ≥ 8). According to multivariate regression analysis, female sex, a higher level of interleukin (AL)-1β and greater self-perceived illness severity were all significantly associated with a higher PHQ-9 score, higher GAD-7 score and higher ISI score. In addition, the disease duration and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were positively related to patients’ self-perceived illness severity. The results of the SEM analyses suggested that sex (β = 0.313, P < 0.001), self-perceived illness severity (β = 0.411, P < 0.001) and levels of inflammatory markers (β = 0.358, P = 0.002) had direct effects on patients’ mental health. The disease duration (β = 0.163, P = 0.003) and levels of inflammatory markers (β = 0.101, P = 0.016) also indirectly affected patients’ mental health, with self-perceived illness severity acting as a mediator. CONCLUSION: A majority of COVID-19 infected inpatients reported experiencing mental health disturbances. Female sex, disease duration, levels of inflammatory markers and self-perceived illness severity are factors that could be used to predict the severity of patients’ mental symptoms.","Hu, Yanyu; Chen, Yingying; Zheng, Yixiong; You, Ciping; Tan, Jing; Hu, Lan; Zhang, Zhenqing; Ding, Lijun",Brain Behav Immun,371,32

As elsewhere in Europe and Internationally, associated restrictions initially limited individual mobility and workplace activity to essential services and travel, and significant air quality benefits were widely anticipated. Here, break-point/segment methods are applied to air pollutant time-series from the first half of 2020 to provide an independent estimate of the timings of discrete changes in NO, NO2, NOx, O3, PM10 and PM2.5 time-series from Automatic Urban Rural Network (AURN) monitoring stations across the UK. NO, NO2 and NOx all exhibit abrupt decreases at the time the UK locked down of (on average) 7.6 to 17 μg.m-3 (or 32 to 50%) at Urban Traffic stations and 4 to 5.7 μg.m-3 (or 26 to 46%) at Urban Background stations. However, after the initial abrupt reduction, gradual increases were then observed through lockdown. This suggests that the return of vehicles to the road during early lockdown has already offset much of the air quality improvement seen when locking down (provisional estimate 50 to 70% by 01 July). While locking down O3 increased (7 to 7.4 μg.m-3 or 14 to 17% at Urban stations) broadly in line with NO2 reductions, but later changes suggest significant non-lockdown contributions to O3 during the months that followed. Increases of similar magnitudes were observed for both PM10 (5.9 to 6.3 μg.m-3) and PM2.5 (3.9 to 5.0 μg.m-3) at both Rural and Urban stations alike, but the distribution of changes suggests the lockdown was not an obvious direct source of changes in levels of either of these species during this period, and that more complex contributions, e.g. from resuspension and secondary aerosol, may be more likely major drivers for these changes.","Ropkins, Karl; Tate, James",Sci Total Environ,371,17

Convalescent volunteers were also investigated to evaluate adaptive immunity induced by live virus. Although both vaccines induced antibody- and T cell-mediated immune responses, our analysis revealed significant quantitative and qualitative differences between the two types of challenges. The BBIBP-CorV vaccine elicited antireceptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG, as well as anti-spike protein (S) IgG and IgA antibodies in healthy individuals, the levels of which were much lower than after BNT162b2 vaccination but still higher than in the convalescent patients. The cumulative IFNγ-positive T cell response, however, was only twofold higher in participants injected with BNT162b2 compared to those who were primed and boosted with BBIBP-CorV vaccine. Moreover, the inactivated virus vaccine induced T cell response that targets not only the S but also the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins, whereas the mRNA vaccine was able to elicit a much narrower response that targets the S protein epitopes only. Thus, the pattern of BBIBP-CorV-induced T cell response in virus-naive participants was similar to the cell-mediated anti-SARS-CoV-2 response observed in convalescent patients. Based on these data, we can conclude that the BBIBP-CorV inactivated virus vaccine is immunologically effective. However, the duration of BBIBP-CorV-induced integrated, antibody, and T cell-mediated, immune responses needs further investigation.

While millions of genetic variants are now mapped in genome sequencing projects, distinguishing functional variants remains a major challenge. Protein-coding variation can be interpreted using post-translational modification (PTM) sites that are core components of cellular signaling networks controlling molecular processes and pathways. ActiveDriverDB is an interactive proteo-genomics database that uses more than 260,000 experimentally detected PTM sites to predict the functional impact of genetic variation in disease, cancer and the human population. Using machine learning tools, we prioritize proteins and pathways with enriched PTM-specific amino acid substitutions that potentially rewire signaling networks via induced or disrupted short linear motifs of kinase binding. We then map these effects to site-specific protein interaction networks and drug targets. In the 2021 update, we increased the PTM datasets by nearly 50%, included glycosylation, sumoylation and succinylation as new types of PTMs, and updated the workflows to interpret inherited disease mutations. We added a recent phosphoproteomics dataset reflecting the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 to predict the impact of human genetic variation on COVID-19 infection and disease course. Overall, we estimate that 16-21% of known amino acid substitutions affect PTM sites among pathogenic disease mutations, somatic mutations in cancer genomes and germline variants in the human population. These data underline the potential of interpreting genetic variation through the lens of PTMs and signaling networks.

In this initial study we investigate how the use of immersive virtual environments for Power-Point based informational learning may benefit learners and mimic traditional lectures successfully. We examine the role of embodied agent tutors which are frequently implemented within virtual learning environments. We find similar performance on a bespoke knowledge test and metrics for motivation, satisfaction, and engagement by learners in both real and virtual environments, regardless of embodied agent tutor presence. Our results raise questions regarding the viability of using virtual environments for remote-learning paradigms, and we emphasise the need for further investigation to inform the design of effective remote-learning applications.","Fitton, Isabel S.; Finnegan, Daniel J.; Proulx, Michael J.",PeerJ Comput Sci,371,3

Here we describe seven cases from Brazil of outpatients with previous mild or moderate COVID-19 who developed subacute cognitive disturbances. Methods: From June 1 to August 15, 2020, seven individuals 18 to 60 years old, with confirmed mild/moderate COVID-19 and findings consistent with encephalopathy who were observed >7 days after respiratory symptom initiation, were screened for cognitive dysfunction. Paired sera and CSF were tested for SARS-CoV-2 (IgA, IgG ELISA, and RT-PCR). Serum and intrathecal antibody dynamics were evaluated with oligoclonal bands and IgG index. Cognitive dysfunction was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Clock Drawing Test (CDT). Results: All but one of our patients were female, and the mean age was 42.6 years. Neurologic symptoms were first reported a median of 16 days (IQR 15–33) after initial COVID-19 symptoms. All patients had headache and altered behavior. Cognitive dysfunction was observed mainly in phonemic verbal fluency (MoCA) with a median of six words/min (IQR 5.25–10.75) and altered visuospatial construction with a median of four points (IQR 4–9) (CDT). CSF pleocytosis was not detected, and only one patient was positive for SARS-Co Conclusions: A subacute cognitive syndrome suggestive of SARS-CoV-2-initiated damage to cortico-subcortical associative pathways that could not be attributed solely to inflammation and hypoxia was present in seven individuals with mild/moderate COVID-19.","Matos, Aline de Moura Brasil; Dahy, Flavia Esper; de Moura, João Victor Luisi; Marcusso, Rosa Maria Nascimento; Gomes, Andre Borges Ferreira; Carvalho, Fernanda Martins Maia; Fernandes, Gustavo Bruniera Peres; Felix, Alvina Clara; Smid, Jerusa; Vidal, Jose Ernesto; Frota, Norberto Anizio Ferreira; Casseb, Jorge; Easton, Ava; Solomon, Tom; Witkin, Steven S.; Malta Romano, Camila; de Oliveira, Augusto César Penalva",Front Neurol,371,30

Previously, we found that MHV-JHM neurovirulence was marked by diminished expression of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) mRNA and a reduced presence of CD8 T cells in the CNS concomitant with heightened macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 transcript levels and greater macrophage infiltration relative to MHV-A59 infection. Here, the ability of the S and non-spike genes to regulate these immune responses was evaluated using chimeric viruses. Chimeric viruses WTR13 and S4R22 were made on MHV-A59 variant backgrounds and, respectively, contained the S gene of MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM. Unexpectedly, genes other than S appeared to modulate events critical to viral replication and survival. Unlike unresolving MHV-JHM infections, the clearance of WTR13 and S4R22 infections coincided with strong IFN-γ transcription and an increase in the number of CD8 T cells infiltrating into the CNS. However, despite the absence of detectable viral titers, approximately 40% of S4R22-infected mice succumbed within 3 weeks, indicating that the enhanced mortality following S4R22 infection was not associated with high viral titers. Instead, similar to the MHV-JHM infection, reduced survival following S4R22 infection was observed in the presence of elevated MIP-1α and MIP-1β mRNA accumulation and enhanced macrophage numbers within infected brains. These observations suggest that the S protein of MHV-JHM influences neurovirulence through the induction of MIP-1α- and MIP-1β-driven macrophage immunopathology.","Rempel, Julia D.; Murray, Shannon J.; Meisner, Jeffrey; Buchmeier, Michael J.",Virology,371,20

Recombinant spike protein (S protein), especially the S1 protein, is one of the major reagents used for serological tests. However, the high cost of S protein production and possible cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses pose unavoidable challenges. By taking advantage of a peptide microarray with full spike protein coverage, we analyzed 2,434 sera from 858 COVID-19 patients, 63 asymptomatic patients and 610 controls collected from multiple clinical centers. Based on the results, we identified several S protein-derived 12-mer peptides that have high diagnostic performance. In particular, for monitoring the IgG response, one peptide (aa 1148–1159 or S2–78) exhibited a sensitivity (95.5%, 95% CI 93.7–96.9%) and specificity (96.7%, 95% CI 94.8–98.0%) comparable to those of the S1 protein for the detection of both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, the diagnostic performance of the S2–78 (aa 1148–1159) IgG was successfully validated by ELISA in an independent sample cohort. A panel of four peptides, S1–93 (aa 553–564), S1–97 (aa 577–588), S1–101 (aa 601–612) and S1–105 (aa 625–636), that likely will avoid potential cross-reactivity with sera from patients infected by other coronaviruses was constructed.

In particular, there is still a lack of treatment strategies for the group of elderly and frail patients, who are frequently not capable of receiving standard therapy regimens. Despite comprising the majority of lung cancer patients, this group is underrepresented in clinical trials. This applies also to elderly and frail patients suffering from unresectable stage III NSCLC, who are unfit for chemotherapy, and, therefore, cannot receive the standard therapy comprising of radiochemotherapy and the recently approved subsequent durvalumab consolidation therapy. These patients often receive radiotherapy only, which raises the concern of undertreatment. The TRADE-hypo trial aims at optimizing treatment of this patient group by combining radiotherapy with concomitant durvalumab administration, thereby employing the immune-promoting effects of radiotherapy, and determining safety, feasibility, and efficacy of this treatment. METHODS/ DESIGN: In this prospective phase II clinical trial, durvalumab therapy will be combined with either conventionally fractionated (CON-group) or hypofractionated (HYPO-group) thoracic radiotherapy. A safety stop-and-go lead-in phase will assess safety of hypofractionated radiotherapy with respect to severe pneumonitis in small patient cohorts before opening full enrollment. Tumor tissue, blood and stool samples will be collected before and during the study period to investigate the immunological mechanisms responsible for checkpoint inhibitor efficacy and immune-promoting effects of radiotherapy. DISCUSSION: Preclinical data suggests that irradiation-induced immunogenicity can be further increased if applied in a hypofractionated setting, potentially boosting the expected synergistic effect with immune checkpoint inhibition in restoring the immune anti-tumor response. If proven safe and efficient, a hypofractionated radiation schedule can provide a considerably more practicable option for the patient. Taking into consideration the intend to develop a combination treatment strategy that can be made available to patients soon after proving to be efficient and the potentially elevated toxicity of a hypofractionated radiotherapy approach, this trial was designed as a two-trials-in-one design. An accompanying translational research program is planned striving to gain insights into the tumor-host biology and to identify suitable biomarkers to predict therapy response.

Owing to uncertainties and crisis amid the pandemic, as an emergency announcement, the World Health Organization (WHO) solicits the help of health authorities, especially, researchers to conduct in-depth research on the evolution and treatment of COVID-19. This paper proposes an integer-valued time series model to analyze the series of COVID-19 cases in Mauritius wherein the corresponding innovation term accommodates for covariate specification. In this set-up, sanitary curfew followed by sanitization and sensitization campaigns, time factor and safe shopping guidelines have been tested as the most significant variables, unlike climatic conditions. The over-dispersion estimates and the serial auto-correlation parameter are also statistically significant. This study also confirms the presence of some unobservable effects like the pathological genesis of the novel coronavirus and environmental factors which contribute to rapid propagation of the zoonotic virus in the community. Based on the proposed COM-Poisson mixture models, we could predict the number of COVID-19 cases in Mauritius. The forecasting results provide satisfactory mean squared errors. Such findings will subsequently encourage the policymakers to implement strict precautionary measures in terms of constant upgrading of the current health care and wellness system and re-enforcement of sanitary obligations.","Mamode Khan, Naushad; Soobhug, Ashwinee Devi; Heenaye-Mamode Khan, Maleika",PLoS One,371,20

Sixty of these samples were also analyzed in two other independent laboratories for concordance analysis. Sample processing and analysis of virus genetic material were performed according to standard protocols described elsewhere. Pooling analysis was performed by analyzing the saliva pool and the individual pool components. Results The concordance between NPS and saliva results was 95.2% (Kappa: 0.727, p = 0.0001) and 97.9% without considering inconclusive results (Kappa: 0.852, p = 0.0001). Saliva had a lower number of inconclusive results than NPS (0.9% vs 1.9%). Furthermore, saliva shows a significantly higher concentration of both total RNA and viral copies than NPS.

Syrian refugees provide an example of people who migrated because of a single major event: the war in Syria. The article examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fathering practices. The Swedish COVID-19 strategy differed from those adopted in many other countries. Lockdowns were minimal and were not stringently enforced, based on the assumption that individuals would trust the authorities and would take personal responsibility for complying with their guidelines and recommendations. Previous research suggests that migrants and other vulnerable groups were not always well informed about the public policies introduced prior to and during the pandemic. The article draws on empirical data from a wider research project on the family lives of Syrian migrants in Sweden. The authors present their findings from an analysis of eleven ethnographically informed semi-structured interviews, carried out before and during the pandemic, with married fathers who had been living in Sweden for several years. In this article, they focus on three cases representing fathers with varied educational backgrounds and employment histories. These families had in common what are considered by Swedish standards to be overcrowded living conditions; they were forced to accept close family proximity, both physically and emotionally, as they no longer had the supportive networks they were used to in Syria. The three fathers were found to rely more heavily on information provided by the people with whom they were in contact in Sweden than on policies and recommendations from the authorities. These findings confirmed that the previous experiences among refugees of shifting policies regarding migration and integration had lowered their trust in government. They had learnt that they needed to rely on mutual dependency not only between spouses, but also between parents and children.","Wissö, Therése; Bäck-Wiklund, Margareta",Front Sociol,371,16

The immune system poses the critical interactive chain between the human body and the virus. Here, we make efforts to examine whether comorbidity with type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects the immunological response in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective pilot study investigating immunological characteristics of confirmed cases of COVID-19 with or without comorbid T2D. Two subcohorts of sex- and age-matched participants were eligible for data analysis, of which 33 participants were with T2D and the remaining 37 were nondiabetic (NDM). Cellular immunity was assessed by flow cytometric determination of surface markers including CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD16, and CD56 in peripheral blood. Levels of C reactive protein, immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE), and complements (C3, C4) were detected by rate nephelometry immunoassay. And Th1/Th2 cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) were detected by Cytometric Bead Array. RESULTS: Neutrophil counts were found to be significantly higher in the T2D group than in the NDM group and had a significant relevance with clinical severity. Lymphocyte frequencies showed no significant differences in the two groups. However, the proportions and absolute counts of T, Tc, Th, and NK cells decreased in both groups to different degrees. An abnormal increase in neutrophil count and a decrease in lymphocyte subpopulations may represent risk factors of COVID-19 severity. The level of IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, and C4 showed no significant difference between the two groups, while the IgE levels were higher in the T2D group than in the NDM group (p < 0.05). Th1 cytokines including IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6, as well as CRP, appeared significantly higher in the T2D group.

We aimed to assess safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine in people with HIV and HIV-negative individuals in South Africa. METHODS: In this ongoing, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1B/2A trial (COV005), people with HIV and HIV-negative participants aged 18–65 years were enrolled at seven South African locations and were randomly allocated (1:1) with full allocation concealment to receive a prime-boost regimen of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, with two doses given 28 days apart. Eligibility criteria for people with HIV included being on antiretroviral therapy for at least 3 months, with a plasma HIV viral load of less than 1000 copies per mL. In this interim analysis, safety and reactogenicity was assessed in all individuals who received at least one dose of ChAdOx1 nCov 19 between enrolment and Jan 15, 2021. Primary immunogenicity analyses included participants who received two doses of trial intervention and were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at baseline. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04444674, and the Pan African Clinicals Trials Registry, PACTR202006922165132. FINDINGS: Between June 24 and Nov 12, 2020, 104 people with HIV and 70 HIV-negative individuals were enrolled. 102 people with HIV (52 vaccine; 50 placebo) and 56 HIV-negative participants (28 vaccine; 28 placebo) received the priming dose, 100 people with HIV (51 vaccine; 49 placebo) and 46 HIV-negative participants (24 vaccine; 22 placebo) received two doses (priming and booster). In participants seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, there were 164 adverse events in those with HIV (86 vaccine; 78 placebo) and 237 in HIV-negative participants (95 vaccine; 142 placebo). Of seven serious adverse events, one severe fever in a HIV-negative participant was definitely related to trial intervention and one severely elevated alanine aminotranferase in a participant with HIV was unlikely related; five others were deemed unrelated. One person with HIV died (unlikely related). People with HIV and HIV-negative participants showed vaccine-induced serum IgG responses against wild-type Wuhan-1 Asp614Gly (also known as D614G). For participants seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 antigens at baseline, full-length spike geometric mean concentration (GMC) at day 28 was 163·7 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL (95% CI 89·9–298·1) for people with HIV (n=36) and 112·3 BAU/mL (61·7–204·4) for HIV-negative participants (n=23), with a rising day 42 GMC booster response in both groups. Baseline SARS-CoV-2 seropositive people with HIV demonstrated higher antibody responses after each vaccine dose than did people with HIV who were seronegative at baseline. High-level binding antibody cross-reactivity for the full-length spike and receptor-binding domain of the beta variant (B.1.351) was seen regardless of HIV status. In people with HIV who developed high titre responses, predominantly those who were receptor-binding domain seropositive at enrolment, neutralising activity against beta was retained.

This study aims to explore differences in the pediatric mortality rate between countries. Methods: Countries with populations over 5 million that report COVID-19 deaths disaggregated data by quinquennial or decennial age groups were analyzed. Data were extracted from COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Age Database, national ministries of health, and the World Health Organization. Results: 23 countries were included in the analysis. Pediatric mortality varied from 0 to 12.1 deaths per million people of the corresponding age group, with the highest rate in Peru. In most countries, deaths were more frequent in the 0-4 years old age group, except for Brazil. The pediatric/ general COVID-19 mortality showed a great variation between countries and ranged from 0 (Republic of Korea) to 10.4% (India). Pediatric and Pediatric/general COVID mortality have a strong correlation with 2018 neonatal mortality (r=0.77, p<0.001 and r= 0.88, p<0.001 respectively), while it has a moderate or absent (r=0.47, p=0.02 and r=0.19, p=0.38, respectively) correlation with COVID-19 mortality in the general population. Conclusions: There is an important heterogenicity in pediatric COVI-19 mortality between countries that parallels historical neonatal mortality. Neonatal mortality is a known index of the quality of a country s Health System which points to the importance of social determinants of health in pediatric COVID-19 mortality disparities, an issue which should be further explored.","Gonzalez-Garcia, N.; Miranda-Lora, A.

The secondary objective was to determine whether there were prognostic factors associated with the occurrence and severity of developed dependency-related injuries during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, single-centre, case-control study was conducted to compare SARS-CoV-2 patients who developed dependency-related injuries after the first 48 hours after admission with a control group made up of SARS-CoV-2 patients without dependency-related injuries. The cases of the 1,987 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the study period were reviewed. Data from 94 patients who developed dependency-related injuries and from 190 patients who did not develop them during hospital admission were analysed. RESULTS: High baseline dependency levels, prolonged hospital stays, and low oxygen saturation levels on arrival in emergency department triage were associated with the occurrence of dependency-related injuries among patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to complications such as dependency-related injuries. Although there are several non-modifiable variables associated with the occurrence of dependency-related injuries in these patients, it is essential to conduct further research and introduce consensus guidelines to reduce their incidence and prevalence.","Sianes-Gallén, Mònica; Pujol-García, Anna María; García, Montserrat Rus; Luque, Carmen Partera; Postigo, Montserrat López; Mañosa, Silvia Call; Camposo Montesino, María Carmen; Touriño, Belén Ibáñez; Obon, Eulalia Ribas; Rodríguez, Tania Segura; Fuentes, Pilar Cores; Sanantonio, Marta Tamame; Jornet-Gibert, Montsant",J Tissue Viability,371,29

The strategy used by SARS‐CoV‐2 to evade antiviral immunity needs further investigation. Here, we reported that SARS‐CoV‐2 ORF9b inhibited types I and III IFN production by targeting multiple molecules of innate antiviral signaling pathways. SARS‐CoV‐2 ORF9b impaired the induction of types I and III IFNs by Sendai virus and poly (I:C). SARS‐CoV‐2 ORF9b inhibited the activation of types I and III IFNs induced by the components of cytosolic dsRNA‐sensing pathways of RIG‐I/MDA5‐MAVS signaling, including RIG‐I, MDA‐5, MAVS, TBK1, and IKKε, rather than IRF3‐5D, which is the active form of IRF3. SARS‐CoV‐2 ORF9b also suppressed the induction of types I and III IFNs by TRIF and STING, which are the adaptor protein of the endosome RNA‐sensing pathway of TLR3‐TRIF signaling and the adaptor protein of the cytosolic DNA‐sensing pathway of cGAS–STING signaling, respectively. A mechanistic analysis revealed that the SARS‐CoV‐2 ORF9b protein interacted with RIG‐I, MDA‐5, MAVS, TRIF, STING, and TBK1 and impeded the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. In addition, SARS‐CoV‐2 ORF9b facilitated the replication of the vesicular stomatitis virus. Therefore, the results showed that SARS‐CoV‐2 ORF9b negatively regulates antiviral immunity and thus facilitates viral replication. This study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanism through which SARS‐CoV‐2 impairs antiviral immunity and provides an essential clue to the pathogenesis of COVID‐19.","Han, Lulu; Zhuang, Meng‐Wei; Deng, Jian; Zheng, Yi; Zhang, Jing; Nan, Mei‐Ling; Zhang, Xue‐Jing; Gao, Chengjiang; Wang, Pei‐Hui",J Med Virol,371,1

METHODS: A two-center, retrospective cohort study, for COVID19 critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs). We included critically ill patients aged 18 years or older who received tocilizumab during ICU stay. Patients were divided into two groups based on the number of the received tocilizumab doses. The primary outcome was the in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Propensity score (PS) matching was used (1:1 ratio) based on the selected criteria. RESULTS: A total of 298 patients were included in the study; 70.4% (210 patients) received a single dose of tocilizumab. After adjusting for possible confounders, the 30-day mortality (HR 0.79 95% CI 0.43–1.45P = 0.44) and in-hospital mortality (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.46–1.49;P = 0.53) were not significantly different between the two groups. On the flip side, patients who received multiple doses had higher pneumonia odds than a single dose (OR 3.81; 95% CI 1.79–8.12 P = 0.0005).

Twenty healthy participants were gathered from different schools in Tehran using the available sampling method. The QEEG data collection was performed in three states: closed-eye and open-eye states, and during a working memory task. As expected, the power ratios did not show a significant difference between the two groups. Regarding our interest in the complexity of signals, we used the Higuchi algorithm as the feature extractor to provide the input materials for the multilayer perceptron classifier. The results showed that the model had at least a 95% precision rate in classifying the addicts and healthy controls in all three types of tasks. Moreover, significant differences in the Higuchi Fractal Dimension of a few EEG channels have been observed. This study confirms the importance of brain wave complexity in QEEG data analysis and assesses the correlation between EEG-complexity and gaming disorder. Moreover, feature extraction by Higuchi algorithm can render support vector machine classification of the brain waves of addicts and healthy controls more accurate.","Hosseini, Zahrasadat; Delpazirian, Roya; Lanjanian, Hossein; Salarifar, Mona; Hassani-Abharian, Peyman",Appl Psychophysiol Biofeedback,371,3

Previous studies suggested dromedary camels were a reservoir for this virus. We tested for the presence of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels from a farm in Qatar linked to two human cases of the infection in October, 2013. METHODS: We took nose swabs, rectal swabs, and blood samples from all camels on the Qatari farm. We tested swabs with RT-PCR, with amplification targeting the E gene (upE), nucleocapsid (N) gene, and open reading frame (ORF) 1a. PCR positive samples were tested by different MERS-CoV specific PCRs and obtained sequences were used for phylogentic analysis together with sequences from the linked human cases and other human cases. We tested serum samples from the camels for IgG immunofluorescence assay, protein microarray, and virus neutralisation assay. FINDINGS: We obtained samples from 14 camels on Oct 17, 2013. We detected MERS-CoV in nose swabs from three camels by three independent RT-PCRs and sequencing. The nucleotide sequence of an ORF1a fragment (940 nucleotides) and a 4·2 kb concatenated fragment were very similar to the MERS-CoV from two human cases on the same farm and a MERS-CoV isolate from Hafr-Al-Batin. Eight additional camel nose swabs were positive on one or more RT-PCRs, but could not be confirmed by sequencing. All camels had MERS-CoV spike-binding antibodies that correlated well with the presence of neutralising antibodies to MERS-CoV. INTERPRETATION: Our study provides virological confirmation of MERS-CoV in camels and suggests a recent outbreak affecting both human beings and camels. We cannot conclude whether the people on the farm were infected by the camels or vice versa, or if a third source was responsible.

However, more research is still needed to implement SMS in the screening process. We present a study protocol to assess the impact on health and economics of three targeted SMS-based interventions in population-based cancer screening programs. METHODS/DESIGN: The M-TICs study is a randomized controlled trial with a formal process evaluation. Participants aged 50–69 years identified as eligible from the colorectal cancer (CRC) and breast cancer (BC) screening program of the Catalan Institute of Oncology (Catalonia, Spain) will be randomly assigned to receive standard invitation procedure (control group) or SMS-based intervention to promote participation. Two interventions will be conducted in the CRC screening program: 1) Screening invitation reminder: Those who do not participate in the CRC screening within 6 weeks of invite will receive a reminder (SMS or letter); 2) Reminder to complete and return fecal immunochemical test (FIT) kit: SMS reminder versus no intervention to individuals who have picked up a FIT kit at the pharmacy and they have not returned it after 14 days. The third intervention will be performed in the BC screening program. Women who had been screened previously will receive an SMS invitation or a letter invitation to participate in the screening. As a primary objective we will assess the impact on participation for each intervention. The secondary objectives will be to analyze the cost-effectiveness of the interventions and to assess participants’ perceptions.

Four physical performance measures (PPMs) have been recently validated for use with nonarthritic hip conditions; however, their ability to detect functional improvement and correlate with improvements in popular hip-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments after PAO is unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the responsiveness of four PPMs up to 1 year after PAO, compare PPMs with established PRO measures at these time points, and report the acceptability and utility of PPMs for assessing outcomes after PAO. METHODS: Twenty-two participants aged 15 to 39 years completed the timed stair ascent (TSA), sit-to-stand five times (STS5), self-selected walking speed, four-square-step test, and seven hip-specific PRO measures before surgery and at approximately 6 months and 1 year after PAO. They completed questions regarding acceptability and utility of both types of testing. Wilcoxon rank sum test and unpaired Student t-tests were used to assess differences between time points; Spearman correlation and generalized linear modeling were used to determine the relationship between PPMs and PRO measures. RESULTS: Six months after PAO, participants showed significant improvements on all seven PRO instruments (P < 0.001) and on the STS5 (P = 0.01). At one year, these improvements were maintained and TSA also improved (P = 0.03). Improvement in other PPMs did not reach significance (P = 0.07 and 0.08). The STS5 test demonstrated moderate to strong correlation (|r| = 0.43 to 0.76, P < 0.05) with all PRO measures, and the TSA test demonstrated moderate to strong correlation with almost all measures (|r| = 0.43 to 0.58, P < 0.05). Correlations strengthened on subanalysis of participants with unilateral disease (n = 11) (|r| = 0.56 to 0.94, P < 0.05). All participants (100%) found PPM testing acceptable despite disability; 25% preferred PPMs to PRO measures, whereas 75% of participants found them equal in usefulness. DISCUSSION: The STS5 and TSA tests demonstrated moderate to very strong correlation with PRO measures at six and 12 months after PAO for dysplasia. These tests could be used as a functional outcome to supplement PRO instruments after PAO.","Scott, Elizabeth J.; Willey, Michael C.; Davison, John C.; Westermann, Robert W.; Paulson, Amanda C.; Wilken, Jason M.",J Am Acad Orthop Surg Glob Res Rev,371,24

Clues may lie with the predisposition to hypoxemia or unexpected absence of dyspnea (‘silent hypoxemia’) in some patients who later develop respiratory failure. Using a recently-validated breath-holding technique, we sought to test the hypothesis that gas exchange and ventilatory control deficits observed at admission are associated with subsequent adverse COVID-19 outcomes (composite primary outcome: non-invasive ventilatory support, intensive care admission, or death). METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 (N = 50) performed breath-holds to obtain measurements reflecting the predisposition to oxygen desaturation (mean desaturation after 20-s) and reduced chemosensitivity to hypoxic-hypercapnia (including maximal breath-hold duration). Associations with the primary composite outcome were modeled adjusting for baseline oxygen saturation, obesity, sex, age, and prior cardiovascular disease. Healthy controls (N = 23) provided a normative comparison. RESULTS: The adverse composite outcome (observed in N = 11/50) was associated with breath-holding measures at admission (likelihood ratio test, p = 0.020); specifically, greater mean desaturation (12-fold greater odds of adverse composite outcome with 4% compared with 2% desaturation, p = 0.002) and greater maximal breath-holding duration (2.7-fold greater odds per 10-s increase, p = 0.036). COVID-19 patients who did not develop the adverse composite outcome had similar mean desaturation to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Breath-holding offers a novel method to identify patients with high risk of respiratory failure in COVID-19. Greater breath-hold induced desaturation (gas exchange deficit) and greater breath-holding tolerance (ventilatory control deficit) may be independent harbingers of progression to severe disease.

This is followed by a critical assessment of mask use based on a review of published evidence in three key domains: the degree to which each mask type is shown to protect against airborne and aerosolized disease, the reported likelihood for non-compliance among mask users, and risk factors associated with both proper and improper mask use. We use this information to conclude our review with several practical, evidence-based recommendations for mask use in dental and dental educational clinics.","Bradford Smith, P.; Agostini, Gina; Mitchell, John C.",Saf Sci,371,1

Although there have been several studies investigating prognostic factors for severe COVID-19, there have been no such studies in Korea. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study of 110 patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized at a tertiary hospital in Daegu, Korea. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were collected and analyzed. Severe disease was defined as a composite outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome, intensive care unit care, or death. RESULTS: Diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 19.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.90–193.42; P = 0.012), body temperature ≥ 37.8°C (OR, 10.91; 95% CI, 1.35–88.36; P = 0.025), peripheral oxygen saturation < 92% (OR, 33.31; 95% CI, 2.45–452.22; P = 0.008), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) > 6.3 (OR, 56.84; 95% CI, 2.64–1,223.78, P = 0.010) at admission were associated with higher risk of severe COVID-19. The likelihood of development of severe COVID-19 increased with an increasing number of prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found that diabetes mellitus, body temperature ≥ 37.8°C, peripheral oxygen saturation < 92%, and CK-MB > 6.3 are independent predictors of severe disease in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Appropriate assessment of prognostic factors and close monitoring to provide the necessary interventions at the appropriate time in high-risk patients may reduce the case fatality rate of COVID-19.","Jang, Jong Geol; Hur, Jian; Choi, Eun Young; Hong, Kyung Soo; Lee, Wonhwa; Ahn, June Hong",J Korean Med Sci,371,21

However, for patients with severe viral pneumonia, the corticosteroid treatment is highly controversial. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review is to systematically evaluate the effect and potential mechanism of corticosteroid administration in pandemic viral pneumonia. SOURCES: We comprehensively searched all manuscripts on corticosteroids therapy for influenza, SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 viral pneumonia from the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases. CONTENT: We systematic summarized the effects of corticosteroids therapy for pandemic viral pneumonia and the potential mechanism of corticosteroid worked in COVID-19. IMPLICATIONS: Observational studies showed that corticosteroid treatment was associated with increased mortality and nosocomial infections for influenza and delay virus clearance for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Limited data on corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19 were reported. Corticosteroids were used in about a fifth of patients (670/2995, 22.4%). Although clinical observational studies reported the improvement in symptoms and oxygenation for the severe COVID-19 patients received corticosteroids therapy, case fatality rate in the corticosteroid group was significantly higher than that in the non-corticosteroid group (69/443, 15.6% vs 56/1310, 4.3%). Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were more likely to receive corticosteroid therapy (201/382, 52.6% vs 201/1310, 15.3%). Although there is no evidence of corticosteroid therapy reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients, some improvements in clinical symptoms and oxygenation were reported in some clinical observational studies. Excessive inflammatory response and lymphopenia might be critical factors associated with disease severity and mortality of COVID-19. Sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials with rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria and standardized dose and duration of corticosteroids are needed to verify the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroid therapy.","Yang, Jia-Wei; Yang, Ling; Luo, Rong-Guang; Xu, Jin-Fu",Clin Microbiol Infect,371,20

The main challenge of this disease is the primary diagnosis to prevent secondary infections and its spread from one person to another. Therefore, it is essential to use an automatic diagnosis system along with clinical procedures for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to prevent its spread. Artificial intelligence techniques using computed tomography (CT) images of the lungs and chest radiography have the potential to obtain high diagnostic performance for Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study, a fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector machine (SVM), and Sobel filter is proposed to detect COVID-19 using X-ray images. A new X-ray image dataset was collected and subjected to high pass filter using a Sobel filter to obtain the edges of the images. Then these images are fed to CNN deep learning model followed by SVM classifier with ten-fold cross validation strategy. This method is designed so that it can learn with not many data. Our results show that the proposed CNN-SVM with Sobel filter (CNN-SVM + Sobel) achieved the highest classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 99.02%, 100% and 95.23%, respectively in automated detection of COVID-19. It showed that using Sobel filter can improve the performance of CNN. Unlike most of the other researches, this method does not use a pre-trained network. We have also validated our developed model using six public databases and obtained the highest performance. Hence, our developed model is ready for clinical application.","Sharifrazi, Danial; Alizadehsani, Roohallah; Roshanzamir, Mohamad; Joloudari, Javad Hassannataj; Shoeibi, Afshin; Jafari, Mahboobeh; Hussain, Sadiq; Sani, Zahra Alizadeh; Hasanzadeh, Fereshteh; Khozeimeh, Fahime; Khosravi, Abbas; Nahavandi, Saeid; Panahiazar, Maryam; Zare, Assef; Islam, Sheikh Mohammed Shariful; Acharya, U.

We take as input proximity contact records based on bluetooth technology and the infectious disease parameters from the literature. Using proximity contact data for a case-study workplace and an infection transmission model, we estimate the SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate as 0.014 per proximity contact, going up to 0.041 for the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant first detected in the UK. Defining super-spreading as events with 10 or more secondary infections, we obtain a super-spreading event rate of 2.3 per 1000 imported SARS-CoV-2 cases, rising up to 13.7 for SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7.

METHODS: Pups were selected from pet shops and breeding facilities and assigned a faecal and clinical score. Standard isolation methods were used to determine presence of parasites, viruses and bacteria in faecal samples. For Escherichia coli, virulence genes were assessed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Fifty‐six pups were included in this study. Eighteen had no diarrhoea, 22 had no significant clinical signs related to gastroenteritis. Samples were positive for Toxocara canis (n=29), Giardia duodenalis (n=35), Cystoisospora (n=22), E. coli (n=47) and Clostridium perfringens (n=20). In four E. coli positive samples, genes were detected that correlate with pathogenicity in other animal species. A significant positive correlation between the presence of T. canis and faecal score was found. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Puppies obtained from a pet shop or breeding facility have a high risk of gastrointestinal disease. Furthermore, infectious agents may be present independently of faecal or clinical score. The identification of possible pathogenic E. coli strains suggests that their role in diarrhoea warrant further investigation.","Dupont, S.; Butaye, P.; Claerebout, E.; Theuns, S.; Duchateau, L.; Van de Maele, I.; Daminet, S.",J Small Anim Pract,371,16

The most promising vaccines require two injections separated 3-4 weeks apart. To achieve heard immunity, 60-80% of the population or perhaps more must be inoculated. Anticipation of adherence challenges has generated commentaries on strategies to enhance adherence including financial incentives. A notable gap in these commentaries is any discussion of the scientific evidence regarding the efficacy of financial incentives for increasing vaccine adherence. This commentary addresses that gap. There is a body of controlled trials on incentivizing vaccine adherence, mostly to the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine among injection drug users (IDUs). Prevalence of HBV infection is increasing as part of the opioid addiction crisis. The HBV vaccine entails a three-dose regimen (typically 0, 1, and 6 months) which has created adherence challenges among IDUs. Systematic literature reviews document significant benefit of financial incentives. For example, a 2019 meta-analysis (Tressler & Bhandari, 2019) examined 11 controlled trials examining HBV-vaccine adherence strategies, including financial incentives, accelerated dosing schedules, and case-management/enhanced services. Financial incentives were most effective resulting in a 7-fold increase in adherence to the vaccination regimen relative to no financial incentives (OR, 7.01; 95% CI, 2.88-17.06). Additional reviews provide further support for the efficacy of financial incentives for promoting adherence with vaccination (HBV & influenza). Overall, this literature suggests that financial incentives could be helpful in promoting the high levels of adherence to COVID-19 vaccines that experts project will be necessary for herd immunity.","Higgins, Stephen T.; Klemperer, Elias M.; Coleman, Sulamunn R.M.",Prev Med,371,10

Existing work points to the efficacy of audio description to guarantee immersion and emotional engagement, but evidence on its role in sexual arousal and engagement in porn is still scant. The present study takes on this challenge by comparing sighted and visually impaired participants’ experiences with porn in terms of their physiological response [i.e., cortisol and heart rate (HR)] and self-report measures of affect [Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS); Watson et al., 1988], anxiety [State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI); Spielberger et al., 1970], sexual reactivity and arousal [Sexual Inhibition/Sexual Excitation Scale (SIS/SES); Moyano and Sierra (2014); and the Ratings of Sexual Arousal (RSA); Mosher (2011)], and narrative engagement or transportation [The Transport Narrative Questionnaire, Green and Brock (2013)]. 69 Spanish participants were allocated into three different groups: 25 sighted participants who watched and heard the porn scenes in their audio-visual version (AV); 22 sighted participants who listened to the audio described version without images (AD); and 22 visually impaired participants who also listened to the audio described version without images (ONCE). Overall, results on physiological and self-report measures revealed no significant differences between groups or different versions of the clips. The analysis of cortisol reactivity to porn as the maximum increase or decrease in cortisol (t+12) with respect to baseline values (t−20) revealed no significant differences between the groups, but pointed to a higher percentage of non-responders than responders in the three groups, the highest being found in the ONCE group. As for participants’ cardiac response to the clips, no significant differences were found across the groups, with the highest HR levels being registered in the baseline phase. Self-report measures revealed significant between-group differences in negative affect. The ONCE group displayed the highest pre-task levels of negative affect and was the only group that showed a decrease in negative affect after exposure to the clips. Sighted and visually impaired participants reported to be moderately aroused and immersed in the films, regardless of exposure to AV or AD porn. In addition, correlations found between participants’ levels of self-report sexual arousal and transportation and post-task affect pointed to a positive relationship between exposure to porn and perceived levels of sexual arousal and affect. Results from the study reflected the efficacy of audio description in providing sighted and visually impaired audiences with a similar experience to that offered by original AV porn scenes. This study is exploratory but provides valid, initial groundwork for further research on the impact of audio description on porn reception.","Rojo López, Ana M; Ramos Caro, Marina; Espín López, Laura",Front Psychol,371,26

Infections in pregnant cattle lead to abortion via transplacental (congenitally from mother to fetus) transmission. In this study, a N. caninum profilin (NcPROF), was expressed in silkworm larvae by recombinant Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) bacmid and was purified from the hemolymph. Three NcPROF constructs were investigated, native NcPROF fused with an N-terminal PA tag (PA-NcPROF), PA-NcPROF fused with the signal sequence of bombyxin from B. mori (bx-PA-NcPROF), and bx-PA-NcPROF with additional C-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of GP64 from BmNPV (bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM). All recombinant proteins were observed extra- and intracellularly in cultured Bm5 cells and silkworm larvae. The bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was partly abnormally secreted, even though it has the transmembrane domain, and only it was pelleted by ultracentrifugation, but PA-NcPROF and bx-PA-NcPROF were not. Additionally, bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM was successfully purified from silkworm hemolymph by anti-PA agarose beads while PA-NcPROF and bx-PA-NcPROF were not. The purified bx-PA-NcPROF-GP64TM protein bound to its receptor, mouse Toll-like receptor 11 (TLR-11), and formed unique nanoparticles. These results suggest that profilin fused with GP64TM was secreted as a nanoparticle with binding affinity to its receptor and this nanoparticle formation is advantageous for the development of vaccines to N. caninum.","Suhaimi, Hamizah; Hiramatsu, Rikito; Xu, Jian; Kato, Tatsuya; Park, Enoch Y.",Nanomaterials (Basel),371,16

A new human-pathogenic parvovirus, human bocavirus (HBoV), has recently been discovered and associated with respiratory disease in small children. However, many patients have presented with low viral DNA loads, suggesting HBoV persistence and rendering polymerase chain reaction-based diagnosis problematic. Moreover, nothing is known of HBoV immunity. We examined HBoV-specific systemic B cell responses and assessed their diagnostic use in young children with respiratory disease. Patients and methods. Paired serum samples from 117 children with acute wheezing, previously studied for 16 respiratory viruses, were tested by immunoblot assays using 2 recombinant HBoV capsid antigens: the unique part of virus protein 1 and virus protein 2. Results. Virus protein 2 was superior to the unique part of virus protein 1 with respect to immunoreactivity. According to the virus protein 2 assay, 24 (49%) of 49 children who were positive for HBoV according to polymerase chain reaction had immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibodies, 36 (73%) had IgG antibodies, and 29 (59%) exhibited IgM antibodies and/or an increase in IgG antibody level. Of 22 patients with an increase in antibody levels, 20 (91%) had a high load of HBoV DNA in the nasopharynx, supporting the hypothesis that a high HBoV DNA load indicates acute primary infection, whereas a low load seems to be of less clinical significance. In a subgroup of patients who were previously determined to have acute HBoV infection (defined as a high virus load in the nasopharynx, viremia, and absence of other viral infections), 9 (100%) of 9 patients had serological evidence of primary infection. In the control group of 68 children with wheezing who had polymerase chain reaction results negative for HBoV in the nasopharynx, 9 (13%) had IgM antibodies, including 5 who displayed an increase in IgG antibody levels and were viremic. No cross-reactivity with human parvovirus B19 was detected. Conclusions. Respiratory infections due to HBoV are systemic, elicit B cell immune responses, and can be diagnosed serologically. Serological diagnoses correlate with high virus loads in the nasopharynx and with viremia. Serological testing is an accurate tool for disclosing the association of HBoV infection with disease.","Kantola, Kalle; Hedman, Lea; Allander, Tobias; Jartti, Tuomas; Lehtinen, Pasi; Ruuskanen, Olli; Hedman, Klaus; Söderlund-Venermo, Maria",Clin Infect Dis,371,32

The outcome was General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), which measures likelihood of common mental disorder (CMD) as a continuous (GHQ-36) and binary measure (score ≥4 = case). We used fixed-effects linear and linear probability models to adjust for time invariant and time-varying confounders. To investigate effect modification, we stratified analyses by age, sex and highest education. RESULTS: A 10% income decrease/increase was associated with a 0.02% increase (95% CI 0.00, 0.04) and 0.01% reduction (95% CI -0.03, 0.02) in likelihood of CMD respectively. Effect sizes were larger for moving into poverty (+1.8% [0.2, 3.5]), out of poverty (−1.8%, [-3.2, −0.3]), job loss (+15.8%, [13.6, 18.0]) and job gain (−11.4%, [-14.4, −8.4]). The effect of new poverty was greater for women (+2.3% [0.8, 3.9] versus +1.2% [-1.1, 3.5] for men) but the opposite was true for job loss (+17.8% [14.4, 21.2] for men versus +13.5% [9.8, 17.2] for women). There were no clear differences by age, but those with least education experienced the largest effects from poverty transitions, especially moving out of poverty (−2.9%, [-5.7, −0.0]). CONCLUSIONS: Moving into unemployment was most strongly associated with CMD, with poverty also important but income effects generally much smaller. Men appear most sensitive to employment transitions, but poverty may have larger impacts on women and those with least education. As the COVID-19 pandemic recedes, minimising unemployment as well as poverty is crucial for population mental health.","Kromydas, Theocharis; Thomson, Rachel M.; Pulford, Andrew; Green, Michael J.; Katikireddi, S.

However, the mechanism that causes olfactory loss is unknown. The primary objective of this study was to explore local proinflammatory cytokine levels in the olfactory epithelium in patients with COVID-19. Biopsies of the olfactory epithelium were taken from patients with confirmed COVID-19 as well as uninfected controls. Levels of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β) were assessed using ELISA and compared between groups. Average TNF-α levels were significantly increased in the olfactory epithelium of the COVID-19 group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). However, no differences in IL-1β were seen between groups. Elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α were seen in the olfactory epithelium in patients with COVID-19. This suggests that direct inflammation of the olfactory epithelium could play a role in the acute olfactory loss described in many patients with COVID-19.","Torabi, Abolfazl; Mohammadbagheri, Esmaeil; Akbari Dilmaghani, Nader; Bayat, Amir-Hossein; Fathi, Mobina; Vakili, Kimia; Alizadeh, Rafieh; Rezaeimirghaed, Omidvar; Hajiesmaeili, Mohammadreza; Ramezani, Mahtab; Simani, Leila; Aliaghaei, Abbas",ACS Chem Neurosci,371,10

Analysis of these mutations is necessary for gaining knowledge regarding different aspects of therapeutic development. Previously, we have reported a Sanger method-based genome sequence of a viral isolate named SARS-CoV-2 NIB-1, circulating in Bangladesh. The genome has four novel non-synonymous mutations in V121D, V843F, A889V, and G1691C positions. RESULTS: Using different computational tools, we have found V121D substitution has the potential to destabilize the non-structural protein-1 (NSP-1). NSP-1 inactivates the type-1 interferon-induced antiviral system. Hence, this mutant could be a basis of attenuated vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. V843F, A889V, and G1691C are all located in nonstructural protein-3 (NSP-3). G1691C can decrease the flexibility of the protein. V843F and A889V might change the binding pattern and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLPro) inhibitor GRL0617. V843F substitution in PLPro was the most prevalent mutation in the clinical samples. This mutation showed a reduced affinity for interferon-stimulated gene-15 protein (ISG-15) and might have an impact on innate immunity and viral spread. However, V843F+A889V double mutant exhibited the same binding affinity as wild type PLPro. A possible reason behind this phenomenon can be that V843F is a conserved residue of PLPro which damaged the protease structure, but A889V, a less conserved residue, presumably neutralized that damage. CONCLUSIONS: Mutants of NSP-1 could provide attenuated vaccines against coronavirus. Also, these mutations of PLPro might be targeted to develop better anti-SARS therapeutics. We hope our study will help to get better insides during the development of attenuated vaccine and PLPro inhibitors.

Although there is no evidence that patients with neuromuscular disorders (NMD) confer a higher infection risk of COVID-19, NMD and its associated therapies may affect the patient's ability to cope with infection or its systemic effects. Moreover, there is a concern that patients with chronic NMD may be at increased risk of manifesting severe symptoms of COVID-19. In particular, as respiratory compromises account for the major cause of mortality and morbidity in NMD patients, newly emerging data also show that the risk of exacerbation caused by COVID-19 accumulates in this particular patient group. For example, patients with motor neuron disease and dystrophinopathies often have ventilatory muscle weakness or cardiomyopathy, which may increase the risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic may severely affect NMD patients. Several neurological associations and neuromuscular networks have recently guided the impact of COVID-19 on patients with NMD, especially in managing cardiopulmonary involvements. It is recommended that patients with moderate- to high-risk NMD be sophisticatedly monitored to reduce the risk of rapid decline in cardiopulmonary function or potential deterioration of the underlying NMD. However, limited neuromuscular-specific recommendations for NMD patients who contract COVID-19 and outcome data are lacking. There is an urgent need to properly modify the respiratory care method for NMD patients, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusively, COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving field, and the practical guidelines for the management of NMD patients are frequently revised. There must be a close collaboration in a multidisciplinary care team that should support their hospital to define a standardized care method for NMD patients during the COVID pandemic. This article reviews evidence-based practical guidelines regarding care delivery, modification, and education, highlighting the need for team-based and interspecialty collaboration.","Tseng, Yung-Hao; Chen, Tai-Heng",Front Neurol,371,20

The behavioral immune system provides a framework for stigmatization in response to infectious disease threats. Specifically, stigmatization might increase with rising levels of infectious disease threat. The present study aimed to examine this hypothesis during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: As part of the “EUCLID” project (https://euclid.dbvis.de), a total of 5011 persons from Germany were surveyed via an online-questionnaire between February 2(nd) and April 3(rd), 2020, covering the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic over three time periods which were defined by critical events. RESULTS: There was no evidence for an increase in the stigmatization of Chinese and Asian-looking people across three topics, that is personal proximity, air travel, and medical measures upon arrival from China. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings provide good news in that participants showed an adaptive response to the infectious disease threat rather than displaying increased stigmatization. Further research is necessary to specify the conditions that increase the risk of stigmatization in response to infectious disease threats.

In this article we analyze public health policies developed in Mexico in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and describe how these policies have largely overlooked the needs of vulnerable mobile populations. We reviewed eighty publicly available documents issued by federal, state, and municipal authorities in Mexico between January and September 2020. Only seven policy documents explicitly considered in-transit migrants and asylum seekers and their health care needs. In addition, we identified six major gaps in these policies that, if addressed, would promote greater inclusion of persons in mobility in future pandemic response plans, to protect the health of migrant populations.","Bojorquez-Chapela, Ietza; Infante, Cesar; Larrea-Schiavon, Silvana; Vieitez-Martinez, Isabel",Health affairs,371,29

Since it is documented that conspiracy theories negatively affect vaccination intentions, these beliefs might become a crucial matter in the near future. We conducted two cross-sectional studies examining the relationship between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, vaccine attitudes, and the intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19 when a vaccine becomes available. We also examined how these beliefs predicted support for a controversial medical treatment, namely, chloroquine. In an exploratory study 1 (N = 409), two subdimensions of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs were associated with negative attitudes toward vaccine science. These results were partly replicated and extended in a pre-registered study 2 (N = 396). Moreover, we found that COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs (among which, conspiracy beliefs about chloroquine), as well as a conspiracy mentality (i.e., predisposition to believe in conspiracy theories) negatively predicted participants’ intentions to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in the future. Lastly, conspiracy beliefs predicted support for chloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. Interestingly, none of the conspiracy beliefs referred to the dangers of the vaccines.

Using a machine learning model to predict lysosomotropism these compounds were evaluated for their ability to possess a lysosomotropic mechanism in vitro. We now demonstrate in vitro that pyronaridine tetraphosphate is an inhibitor of Lysotracker accumulation in lysosomes (IC50 = 0.56 μM). Further, we evaluated antiviral synergy between pyronaridine and artesunate (Pyramax®), which are used in combination to treat malaria. Artesunate was not found to have lysosomotropic activity in vitro and the combination effect on EBOV inhibition was shown to be additive. Pyramax® may represent a unique example of the repurposing of a combination product for another disease.","Lane, Thomas R.; Dyall, Julie; Mercer, Luke; Goodin, Caleb; Foil, Daniel H.; Zhou, Huanying; Postnikova, Elena; Liang, Janie Y.; Holbrook, Michael R.; Madrid, Peter B.; Ekins, Sean",Antiviral Research,371,16

Individuals with mental health difficulties, particularly those with elevated posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), may be especially vulnerable to increased impairment as a result of COVID–19. Additionally, demographic factors, such as age, gender, and race/ethnicity, may impact individual difficulties related to the pandemic. The current study examined the concurrent and prospective associations between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, broader anxiety and depression symptoms, and COVID–19–related disability. Participants recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (N = 136) completed questionnaire batteries approximately 1 month apart during the COVID–19 pandemic (i.e., Wave 1 and Wave 2). The results indicated that PTSD, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were all associated with increased COVID–19–related disability across assessment points, rs = .44–.68. PTSD symptoms, specifically negative alterations in cognition and mood, significantly predicted COVID–19–related disability after accounting for anxiety and depressive symptoms as well as demographic factors, βs = .31–.38. Overall, these findings suggest that individuals experiencing elevated PTSS are particularly vulnerable to increased functional impairment as a result of COVID–19 and suggest a need for additional outreach and clinical care among individuals with elevated PTSD symptoms during the pandemic.","Morabito, Danielle M.; Bedford, Carter E.; Woller, Savannah; Schmidt, Norman B.",J Trauma Stress,371,1

As pandemics such as COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) progress there is an increasing need for effective virtual care and RMT to support patient care while they are at home. Methods : The authors describe their work in conducting literature reviews by searching PubMed.gov and the grey literature for articles, and government websites with guidelines describing the signs and symptoms of COVID-19, as well as the progression of the disease. The reviews focused on identifying gaps where RMT could be applied in novel ways and formed the basis for the subsequent modelling of use cases for applying RMT described in this paper. Results : The work was conducted in the context of a new Home of the Future laboratory which has been set up at the University of Victoria. The literature review led to the development of a number of object-oriented models for deploying RMT. This modeling is being used for a number of purposes, including for education of students in health infomatics as well as testing of new use cases for RMT with industrial collaborators and projects within the smart home of the future laboratory. Conclusions : Object-oriented modeling, based on analysis of gaps in the literature, was found to be a useful approach for describing, communicating and teaching about potential new uses of RMT.","Borycki, Elizabeth M.; Kushniruk, Andre W.; Kletke, Ryan; Vimarlund, Vivian; Senathirajah, Yalini; Quintana, Yuri",Yearb Med Inform,371,32

Articles published after the SARS-CoV-1 (2002) epidemic suggest that the use of an herbal-drug integrative medical approach could have contributed to a lower fatality rate and a more rapid response in controlling the outbreak. METHODS: Pubmed was searched for articles that investigated the antiviral properties and mechanisms of action of herbs or natural compounds against the SARS-coronavirus (CoV). RESULTS: Forty-three (43) relevant papers were located. A general count rendered 450+ herbs and natural compounds with antiviral properties against the SARS-CoV and related viruses. From the 43 articles, thirty-one (31) uncovered the mechanisms of action of the natural substances able to oppose the coronavirus. DISCUSSION: A series of herbs and natural compounds demonstrated moderate to strong antiviral activity. Research on many herbs-natural compounds also showed potent and significant inhibition of CoV-host protein pathways responsible for different phases of viral replication specifically targeting 3CL(PRO), PL(PRO), RdRp, helicase protein, S protein, N protein, 3a protein, Cathepsin L, Nsp1, Nsp3c, and ORF7a, and the S protein-ACE-2 interaction. CONCLUSION: The herbs-natural compounds with antiviral activity and that caused inhibition/blockade of the CoV-host protein pathways are potential therapeutic candidates. The homology between the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 is around 80%. Thus, effective herbs-compounds for the former would likely be beneficial for the latter also depending on target protein similarities between the viruses. Here we provide the mechanistic bases supporting an integrative approach that includes natural compounds to fight coronavirus infections.","Fuzimoto, Andréa D.; Isidoro, Ciro",J Tradit Complement Med,371,16

METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective analysis to compare the mortality changes of all-cause injury and transport injuries, poisoning, falls, fire/heat/hot substances, drowning, self-harm and interpersonal violence, which were further stratified by sex and age. Comparisons were made between the COVID-19 period (between January 2020 and June 2020) and control period (between January 2019 and June 2019) in Guangdong province. We used the negative binomial models to explore the associations of deaths during the COVID-19 period, according to the different sex and age strata. RESULTS: The all-cause injury mortality in Guangdong province decreased significantly from 28.65 per 100 000 population during the control period to 23.24 per 100 000 population during COVID-19 pandemic period. Similar results were found in specific injury categories. Mortality of self-harm increased by 139.26% in the 10–14 year group during the COVID-19 period as compared with the control period. Although mortality changes in some groups were not statistically significant, some increases were noteworthy during the COVID-19 period (ie, self-harm, transport injury and falls) in the 70–79 year group. The corresponding increase in mortality rate was 16.83%, 3.32% and 4.92%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The mortality of all-cause injury, transport injury and drowning during the COVID-19 pandemic was consistently decreased. However, the increase in mortality associated with falls, fire/heat/hot substance injury and self-harm in specific age populations warrant the targeted control and prevention measures for the population at risk.","Zheng, Xue-Yan; Tang, Si-Li; Ma, Shu-Li; Guan, Wei-Jie; Xu, Xiaojun; Xu, Haofeng; Xu, Ying-Shan; Xu, Yan-Jun; Lin, Li-Feng",BMJ Open,371,21

We hypothesized that a newly-developed smartphone application was more objective than questionnaires in assessing HDCPs. Therefore, we aimed to compare both methods, in terms of exposure assessments and respiratory health effects estimates. The women of the SEPAGES birth cohort completed repeated validated questionnaires on HDCPs and respiratory health and used an application to report HDCPs and scan products barcodes, subsequently linked with an ingredients database. Agreements between the two methods were assessed by Kappa coefficients. Logistic regression models estimated associations of HDCP with asthma symptom score. The 101 participants (18 with asthma symptom score ≥1) scanned 617 different products (580 with available ingredients list). Slight to fair agreements for sprays, bleach and scented HDCP were observed (Kappa: 0.35, 0.25, 0.11, respectively). Strength of the associations between HDCP and asthma symptom score varied between both methods but all odds ratios (OR) were greater than one. The number of scanned products used weekly was significantly associated with the asthma symptom score (adjusted-OR [CI 95%]: 1.15 [1.00–1.32]).

As a result, new interest and focus have arisen in KD, and specifically mechanisms of the disease. RECENT FINDINGS: A major question in the literature on the nature of MIS-C is if, and how, it may be related to KD. This has been explored using component analysis type studies, as well as other unsupervised analysis, as well as direct comparisons. At present, the answer to this question remains opaque, and several studies have interpreted their findings in opposing ways. Studies seem to suggest some relationship, but that MIS-C and KD are not the same syndrome. SUMMARY: Study of MIS-C strengthens the likelihood that KD is a postinfectious immune response, and that perhaps multiple infectious agents or viruses underlie the disease. MIS-C and KD, while not the same disease, could plausibly be sibling disorders that fall under a larger syndrome of postacute autoimmune febrile responses to infection, along with Kawasaki shock syndrome.","Gorelik, Mark",Curr. opin. pediatr,371,1

Through the integration of the family embeddedness theory and social exchange theory, we further investigate the potential benefits and costs of family support as a social exchange process between entrepreneurs and their family members. We propose that perceived family support can differentially shape well-being across different entrepreneurial contexts (financial and workload stressors) depending on the nature of the exchange relationship (economic vs. social), thereby dual effects are anticipated from time-based and temporal processes. After analyzing the data gathered from 61 entrepreneurs over 14 days, we found evidence that high levels of family support attenuate the relationships between the financial stressor and the well-being indicators but amplify the relationships between the workload stressor and the well-being indicators. These results demonstrate family support process models are central to between-person heterogeneity.

The main insight of this approach is that research and knowledge co-production is always partial, both in the sense of being incomplete, as well as being circumscribed by the interests of participating researchers and societal partners. A second insight is that project-bound societal engagement takes place in a broader context of public and policy debate. The approach to co-production described here is formed of three recursive processes: co-designing, co-analysing, and co-creating knowledge. These ‘co-production loops’ are themselves iterative, each representing a stage of knowledge production. Each loop is operationalized through a series of research and engagement practices, which we call building blocks. Building blocks are activities and interaction-based methods aimed at bringing together a range of participants involved in joint knowledge production. In practice, recursive iterations within loops may be limited due of constraints on time, resources, or attention. We suggest that co-production loops and building blocks are deployed flexibly.","Audia, Camilla; Berkhout, Frans; Owusu, George; Quayyum, Zahidul; Agyei-Mensah, Samuel",J Urban Health,371,32

The mean percentage of overall INR values in the range was 59.39% ± 32.84, and the mean time with the overall INR was within the therapeutic range 57.81% ± 32.08. Thirty-one percent of the sample had good anticoagulation control (time in therapeutic range >70%). The median satisfaction score was 32 (IQR 28–36) with a maximum score of 40. Conclusion: This is the first study to assess the tele-pharmacy anticoagulation clinic’s efficiency and patient satisfaction in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic. This type of consultation was as effective as face-to-face consultations. The study also highlighted that though the reduction in the cost of care was not substantial, there was a significant increase in resource (clinical pharmacist) utilization as a result of this model. The adoption of tele-pharmacy resulted in time savings for the clinical pharmacists who can be utilized in many other improvement projects in adult ambulatory clinics to ensure the delivery of better quality and safe patient care.","Al Ammari, Maha; AlThiab, Khalefa; AlJohani, Manal; Sultana, Khizra; Maklhafi, Nada; AlOnazi, Hayel; Maringa, Aswaq",Front Pharmacol,371,21

Although cell-based therapies have shown promise in experimental ALI, strategies are needed to enhance the potency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to develop more effective treatments. Genetic modification of MSCs has been demonstrated to significantly improve the therapeutic benefits of these cells; however, the optimal vector for gene transfer is not clear. Given the acute nature of ARDS, transient transfection is desirable to avoid off-target effects of long-term transgene expression, as well as the potential adverse consequences of genomic integration. METHODS: Here, we explored whether a minicircle DNA (MC) vector containing human angiopoietin 1 (MC-ANGPT1) can provide a more effective platform for gene-enhanced MSC therapy of ALI/ARDS. RESULTS: At 24 h after transfection, nuclear-targeted electroporation using an MC-ANGPT1 vector resulted in a 3.7-fold greater increase in human ANGPT1 protein in MSC conditioned media compared to the use of a plasmid ANGPT1 (pANGPT1) vector (2048 ± 567 pg/mL vs. 552.1 ± 33.5 pg/mL). In the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI model, administration of pANGPT1 transfected MSCs significantly reduced bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophil counts by 57%, while MC-ANGPT1 transfected MSCs reduced it by 71% (p < 0.001) by Holm-Sidak’s multiple comparison test. Moreover, compared to pANGPT1, the MC-ANGPT1 transfected MSCs significantly reduced pulmonary inflammation, as observed in decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). pANGPT1-transfected MSCs significantly reduced BAL albumin levels by 71%, while MC-ANGPT1-transfected MSCs reduced it by 85%. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, using a minicircle vector, we demonstrated an efficient and sustained expression of the ANGPT1 transgene in MSCs and enhanced the therapeutic effect on the ALI model compared to plasmid. These results support the potential benefits of MC-ANGPT1 gene enhancement of MSC therapy to treat ARDS.","Florian, Maria; Wang, Jia-Pey; Deng, Yupu; Souza-Moreira, Luciana; Stewart, Duncan J.; Mei, Shirley H.

They have also been associated with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. This has made them an all important agent for CoV evolution and transmission. Our objective in this study was to investigate the dispersal, phylogenomics and evolution of betacoronavirus (βCoV) among African bats. We retrieved sequence data from established databases such as GenBank and Virus Pathogen Resource, covering the partial RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene of Bat coronaviruses from eight African, three Asian, five European, two South American countries and Australia. We analyzed for Phylogeographic information relating to genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics. Our study revealed that majority of the African strains fell within Norbecovirus subgenera, with an Evolutionary rate of 1.301 × 10−3, HPD (1.064 × 10−3 – 1.434 × 10−3) subs/site/year. The African strains diversified into three main subgenera, Norbecovirus, Hibecovirus and Marbecovirus. The time to most common recent ancestor for Norbecovirus strains was 1968, and 2010, for the African Marbecovirus strains. There was evidence of inter species transmission of Norbecovirus among bats in Cameroun and DRC. Phlylogeography showed that there were inter-continental spread of Bt-CoV from Europe, China and Hong Kong into Central and Southern Africa, highlighting the possibility of long distance transmission. Our study has elucidated the possible evolutionary origins of βCoV among African bats, we therefore advocate for broader studies of whole genome sequences of BtCoV to further understand the drivers for their emergence and zoonotic spillovers into human population.","Motayo, Babatunde Olanrewaju; Oluwasemowo, Olukunle Oluwapamilerin; Akinduti, Paul Akiniyi",bioRxiv,371,1

We aimed to quantify the severity of COVID-19 infection on high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) and to determine its relationship with clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 11, 2020, to February 5, 2020, the clinical, laboratory, and high-resolution CT features of 42 patients (26–75 years, 25 males) with COVID-19 were analyzed. The initial and follow-up CT, obtained a mean of 4.5 days and 11.6 days from the illness onset were retrospectively assessed for the severity and progression of pneumonia. Correlations among clinical parameters, initial CT features, and progression of opacifications were evaluated with Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (83%) exhibited a progressive process according to CT features during the early stage from onset. Follow-up CT findings showed progressive opacifications, consolidation, interstitial thickening, fibrous strips, and air bronchograms, compared with initial CT (all P < 0.05). Before regular treatments, there was a moderate correlation between the days from onset and sum score of opacifications (R = 0.68, P < 0.01). The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lactate dehydrogenase showed significantly positive correlation with the severity of pneumonia assessed on initial CT (R(range), 0.36–0.75; P < 0.05). The highest temperature and the severity of opacifications assessed on initial CT were significantly related to the progression of opacifications on follow-up CT (P = 0.001–0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the COVID-19 infection usually presented with typical ground glass opacities and other CT features, which showed significant correlations with some clinical and laboratory measurements. Follow-up CT images often demonstrated progressions during the early stage from illness onset.","Xiong, Ying; Sun, Dong; Liu, Yao; Fan, Yanqing; Zhao, Lingyun; Li, Xiaoming; Zhu, Wenzhen",Invest Radiol,371,1

This interference with nuclear import requires interaction between protein 6 and cellular karyopherins, a process that typically involves nuclear localization signal (NLS) motifs. Here we dissected protein 6 using site-directed mutagenesis and found no evidence for a classical NLS.
