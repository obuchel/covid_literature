Addressing Covid-19 Fear to Encourage Sick Patients to Seek Emergency Care,8.3973465,0.8182228,2020-05-14,"Biopolymers have been used in packaged foods to tackle environmental hazards due to their biodegradability and non-toxic nature. In addition to these merits, they have also several demerits such as poor mechanical properties and low resistance towards water. Nanomaterials have attracted great interest in recent years due to their phenomenal properties that makes them precedent in applications for food packaging as they enhance the mechanical, thermal and gas barriers properties, without compromising with the ability to become non-toxic and biodegradable. The most important nanomaterials used in food packaging are montmorillonite (MMT), zinc oxide (ZnO-NPs) coated silicate, kaolinite, silver NPs (Ag-NPs) and titanium dioxide (TiO(2)NPs) as these, nanomaterials coated films makes a barrier against oxygen, carbon dioxide and favour compounds. They also possess oxygen scavenging capability, antimicrobial activity and tolerance towards temperature. The most difficult task related to the preparation of these nanocomposites is their complete distribution within the polymer matrix and their compatibility. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for improvement in the performance of nano-packaging materials including mechanical stability, degradability and effectiveness of antibacterial property.","Chaudhary, Pallavi; Fatima, Faria; Kumar, Ankur",J Inorg Organomet Polym Mater,793,26

Starting from the 11 (st) of March 2020, the Italian Government approved a series of emergency restrictive measures to limit people’s movement and social contacts. The aim of this short paper is to test if the number of norm-violations (related to people’s movement) might contribute to the peaks of new COVID-19 positives after few days. We show that peaks in the violations of the lockdown norms correspond to peaks in new positive cases about 6 days later.","Ruiu, Gabriele; Ruiu, Maria Laura",,793,12

Complications of malaria present a diversified clinical spectrum, with neurological involvement leading to the most serious related-conditions. The authors recently encountered a case of a 60-year old Italian man presenting with confusion, language disturbances and Parkinson-like syndrome 3 weeks after complete remission from severe Plasmodium falciparum cerebral malaria. Chemical and microbiological analysis revealed aseptic meningitis, diffuse encephalitis and abnormal immune-activation. Re-infection and recrudescence of infection were excluded. Further analysis excluded paraneoplastic and autoimmune causes of encephalitis. A diagnosis of Post-Malaria Neurological Syndrome (PMNS) was finally formulated and successfully treated with high dose of steroids. METHODS: A systematic research of current literature related to PMNS was performed. RESULTS: 151 cases of PMNS were included, the majority of which occurred after severe P. falciparum infections. Four main clinical pattern were identified: 37% of the cases presented as “classical” PMNS, 36% presented as delayed cerebellar ataxia (DCA), 18% resembled acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), and 8% presented as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like form. Differentiation between different forms was not always simple, as clinical and radiological findings frequently overlap. Overall, in almost all of the tested cases, cerebrospinal fluid was found pathological; EEG revealed nonspecific encephalopathy in 30% of classical PMNS and 67% ADEM; imaging tests were found abnormal in 92% of ADEM-like forms. Pathogenesis remains unclear. An autoimmune mechanism is the most corroborated pathogenic hypothesis. Overall, the majority of PMNS cases revert without specific treatment. In most severe forms, high dose steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, and plasmapheresis have been shown to improve symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: PMNS is a disabling complication of malaria. The overall incidence is not known, due to frequent misdiagnosis and under-reporting. Pathogenesis is not also fully understood, but rapid response to immune-modulating treatment along with similarities to auto-immune neurological disease, strongly support a dysregulated immunological genesis of this condition. The lack of randomized controlled studies regarding therapeutic approaches is a major unmet need in this setting. A systematic collection of all the PMNS cases would be desirable, in order to increase awareness of this rare condition and to prospectively investigate the most appropriate management.","Castaldo, Nadia; Tascini, Carlo; Della Siega, Paola; Peghin, Maddalena; Pecori, Davide",Malar J,793,29

Time series were first mapped into a complex network by the horizontal visibility algorithm in order to revel the structure of their temporal characters and dynamics. Then, the synchrony of the time series was investigated to determine the possibility that the cryptocurrencies under study co-bubble simultaneously. Findings reveal similar complex structures for the three virtual currencies in terms of number and internal composition of communities. To the aim of our analysis, such result proves that price and volume dynamics of the cryptocurrencies were characterized by cyclical patterns of similar wavelength and amplitude over the time period considered. Yet, the value of the slope parameter associated with the exponential distributions fitted to the data suggests a higher stability and predictability for Bitcoin and Litecoin than for Ethereum. The study of synchrony between the time series investigated displayed a different degree of synchronization between the three cryptocurrencies before and after a collapse event. These results could be of interest for investors who might prefer to switch from one cryptocurrency to another to exploit the potential opportunities of profit generated by the dynamics of price and volumes in the market of virtual currencies.","Provenzano, Davide; Baggio, Rodolfo",Decisions Econ Finan,793,16
