2255,2255,2255,Can fiberoptic bronchoscopy be applied to critically ill patients treated with noninvasive ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome? Prospective observational study,17.084023,12.00474,2016-05-31,"BACKGROUND: Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is a cornerstone for the treatment of acute respiratory failure of various etiologies. Using NIV is discussed in mild-to-moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients (PaO(2)/FiO(2) > 150). These patients often have comorbidities that increase the risk for bronchoscopy related complications. The primary outcome of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety and contribution in diagnosis and/or modification of the ongoing treatment of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) in patients with ARDS treated with NIV. METHODS: ARDS patients treated with NIV and who require FOB as the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure were included the study. Intensive care ventilators or other dedicated NIV ventilators were used. NIV was applied via simple oro-nasal mask or full-face mask. Pressure support or inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP), external positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) or expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) levels were titrated to achieve an expiratory tidal volume of 8 to 10 ml/kg according to ideal body weight, SpO(2) > 90 % and respiratory rate below 25/min. RESULTS: Twenty eight subjects (mean age 63.3 ± 15.9 years, 15 men, 13 women, PaO(2)/FiO(2) rate 145 ± 50.1 at admission) were included the study. Overall the procedure was well tolerated with only 5 (17.9 %) patients showing minor complications. There was no impairment in arterial blood gas and cardiopulmonary parameters after FOB. PaO(2)/FiO(2) rate increased from 132.2 ± 49.8 to 172.9 ± 63.2 (p = 0.001). No patient was intubated within 2 h after the bronchoscopy. 10.7, 32.1 and 39.3 % of the patients required invasive mechanical ventilation after 8 h, 24 h and 48 h, respectively. Bronchoscopy provided diagnosis in 27 (96.4 %) patients. Appropriate treatment was decided according to the results of the bronchoscopic sampling in 20 (71.4 %) patients. CONCLUSION: FOB under NIV could be considered as a feasible tool for diagnosis and guide for treatment of patients with ARDS treated via NIV in intensive care units. However, FOB-correlated life-treathening complications in severe hypoxemia should not be forgotten. Furthermore, further controlled studies involving a larger series of homogeneous ARDS patients undergoing FOB under NIV are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.","Korkmaz Ekren, Pervin; Basarik Aydogan, Burcu; Gurgun, Alev; Tasbakan, Mehmet Sezai; Bacakoglu, Feza; Nava, Stefano",BMC Pulm Med,347,9

However, no study has assessed the prognostic factors associated with 1-year mortality among PMV patients, not less than 21 days after surgery. This study analyzed the predictors of 1-year mortality in patients requiring PMV in intensive care units (ICUs) after surgery. METHODS: In this multicenter, respective cohort study, 124 patients who required PMV after surgery in the ICUs of five tertiary hospitals in Beijing between January 2007 and June 2016 were enrolled. The primary outcome was the duration of survival within 1 year. Predictors of 1-year mortality were identified with a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model. The predictive effect of the ProVent score was also validated. RESULTS: Of the 124 patients enrolled, the cumulative 1-year mortality was 74.2% (92/124). From the multivariable Cox proportional hazard analysis, cancer diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] 2.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37–3.35; P < 0.01), no tracheostomy (HR 2.01, 95% CI 1.22–3.30; P < 0.01), enteral nutrition intolerance (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.19–2.97; P = 0.01), blood platelet count ≤150 × 10(9)/L (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.14–2.75; P = 0.01), requirement of vasopressors (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.13–2.80; P = 0.02), and renal replacement therapy (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01–2.91; P = 0.047) on the 21st day of mechanical ventilation (MV) were associated with shortened 1-year survival. CONCLUSIONS: For patients who required PMV after surgery, cancer diagnosis, no tracheostomy, enteral nutrition intolerance, blood platelet count ≤150 × 10(9)/L, vasopressor requirement, and renal replacement therapy on the 21st day of MV were associated with shortened 1-year survival. The prognosis in PMV patients in ICUs can facilitate the decision-making process of physicians and patients’ family members on treatment schedule.","Sun, Yueming; Li, Shuangling; Wang, Shupeng; Li, Chen; Li, Gang; Xu, Jiaxuan; Wang, Hongzhi; Liu, Fei; Yao, Gaiqi; Chang, Zhigang; Liu, Yalin; Shang, Meixia; Wang, Dongxin",BMC Anesthesiol,347,9

We previously reported that aerobic growth on citrate (Cit(+)) evolved in an Escherichia coli population during adaptation to a minimal glucose medium containing citrate (DM25). Cit(+) variants can also grow in citrate-only medium (DM0), a novel environment for E. coli. To study adaptation to this niche, we founded two sets of Cit(+) populations and evolved them for 2500 generations in DM0 or DM25. The evolved lineages acquired numerous parallel mutations, many mediated by transposable elements. Several also evolved amplifications of regions containing the maeA gene. Unexpectedly, some evolved populations and clones show apparent declines in fitness. We also found evidence of substantial cell death in Cit(+) clones. Our results thus demonstrate rapid trait refinement and adaptation to the new citrate niche, while also suggesting a recalcitrant mismatch between E. coli physiology and growth on citrate.","Blount, Zachary D; Maddamsetti, Rohan; Grant, Nkrumah A; Ahmed, Sumaya T; Jagdish, Tanush; Baxter, Jessica A; Sommerfeld, Brooke A; Tillman, Alice; Moore, Jeremy; Slonczewski, Joan L; Barrick, Jeffrey E; Lenski, Richard E",,347,6

OBJECTIVES: To validate the concept of “non-locality” to explain cases of Spinal Cord Injury Without Radiographic Abnormality (SCIWORA) previously deemed inexplicable. To investigate and challenge the source data for the SCIWORA hypothesis which has the built-in assumption that a traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) can only be caused by a local or adjacent spinal column injury and which, therefore, postulates that the pediatric spinal column is inherently more flexible than the spinal cord to explain SCI whenever a local spinal column injury is not detected. SETTING: A National Rehabilitation Center, one of fourteen which reports to the Spinal Cord Injury Model System. METHODS: We examined all residual SCIWORA cases over a 5-year period. In addition, we performed an extensive literature search to trace the evidence supporting the SCIWORA hypothesis that children’s spinal columns are inherently lax and may stretch more than the spinal cord prior to disruption. RESULTS: Six SCI patients with a residual diagnosis of SCIWORA were identified, 3 pediatric and 3 adult. All had injuries fitting non-locality. None were an actual SCIWORA. Source data do not appear to support the SCIWORA hypothesis. CONCLUSION: Borrowing from quantum mechanics, we reveal non-locality as a real entity in the spine. The assumption of locality-only is invalid and likely contributed to the SCIWORA hypothesis for the pediatric spine. Misdiagnosis and misunderstanding of SCIWORA may lead to improper treatment and increased cost. Awareness may facilitate search for adequate explanations for difficult cases rather than mere assignment as SCIWORA.","Rolfe, Kevin; Beck, Aaron; Kovach, Tracy; Mayeda, Brian; Liu, Charles",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,347,16

Furthermore, this vector will readily feed on both animals and humans. Targeting this vector while feeding on animals can provide an additional intervention for the current vector control activities. Previous results have displayed the efficacy of using Subolesin/Akirin ortholog vaccines for the control of multiple ectoparasite infestations. This made Akirin a potential antigen for vaccine development against An. arabiensis. METHODS: The efficacy of three antigens, namely recombinant Akirin from An. arabiensis, recombinant Akirin from Aedes albopictus, and recombinant Q38 (Akirin/Subolesin chimera) were evaluated as novel interventions for An. arabiensis vector control. Immunisation trials were conducted based on the concept that mosquitoes feeding on vaccinated balb/c mice would ingest antibodies specific to the target antigen. The antibodies would interact with the target antigen in the arthropod vector, subsequently disrupting its function. RESULTS: All three antigens successfully reduced An. arabiensis survival and reproductive capacities, with a vaccine efficacy of 68–73%. CONCLUSIONS: These results were the first to show that hosts vaccinated with recombinant Akirin vaccines could develop a protective response against this outdoor malaria transmission vector, thus providing a step towards the development of a novel intervention for An. arabiensis vector control.

To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the difference of the susceptibility for Mo infection, RNA-sequencing technology was used to compare the transcriptomic response of the lung tissue of Mo-infected Bbs and Ahs. RESULTS: Six Bbs and six Ahs were divided into experimental group and control group respectively, all of them were experimentally infected with Mo by intratracheal injection. For collecting lung tissue samples, three Bbs and three Ahs were sacrificed on day 4 post-infection, and the others were sacrificed on day 14 post-infection. Total RNA extracted from lung tissue were used for transcriptome analyses based on high-throughput sequencing technique and bioinformatics. The results showed that 212 (146 up-regulated, 66 down-regulated) DEGs were found when comparing transcriptomic data of Bbs and Ahs at 4th dpi, besides, 311 (158 up-regulated, 153 down-regulated) DEGs were found at 14th dpi. After GO analysis, three main GO items protein glycosylation, immune response and positive regulation of gene expression were found related to Mo infection. In addition, there were 20 DEGs enriched in these above items, such as SPLUC1 (BPIFA1), P2X7R, DQA, HO-1 and SP-A (SFTPA-1). CONCLUSIONS: These selected 20 DEGs associated with Mo infection laid the foundation for further study on the underlying molecular mechanism involved in high level of resistance to Mo expressed by Bbs, meanwhile, provided deeper understandings about the development of pathogenicity and host-pathogen interactions.

For the gradient-boosting guidance, we manually create abstracted features by considering arity-based encodings of formulas. For the neural guidance, we use symbol-independent graph neural networks (GNNs) and their embedding of the terms and clauses. The two methods are efficiently implemented in the E prover and its ENIGMA learning-guided framework. To provide competitive real-time performance of the GNNs, we have developed a new context-based approach to evaluation of generated clauses in E. Clauses are evaluated jointly in larger batches and with respect to a large number of already selected clauses (context) by the GNN that estimates their collectively most useful subset in several rounds of message passing. This means that approximative inference rounds done by the GNN are efficiently interleaved with precise symbolic inference rounds done inside E. The methods are evaluated on the MPTP large-theory benchmark and shown to achieve comparable real-time performance to state-of-the-art symbol-based methods. The methods also show high complementarity, solving a large number of hard Mizar problems.","Jakubův, Jan; Chvalovský, Karel; Olšák, Miroslav; Piotrowski, Bartosz; Suda, Martin; Urban, Josef",Automated Reasoning,347,6

Hence, reliable methodologies are required for detecting the NAR tweets during a disaster. The existing works don’t focus well on NAR tweets detection and also had poor performance. Hence, this paper focus on detection of NAR tweets during a disaster. Existing works often use features and appropriate machine learning algorithms on several Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Recently, there is a wide use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in text classification problems. However, it requires a large amount of manual labeled data. There is no such large labeled data is available for NAR tweets during a disaster. To overcome this problem, stacking of Convolutional Neural Networks with traditional feature based classifiers is proposed for detecting the NAR tweets. In our approach, we propose several informative features such as aid, need, food, packets, earthquake, etc. are used in the classifier and CNN. The learned features (output of CNN and classifier with informative features) are utilized in another classifier (meta-classifier) for detection of NAR tweets. The classifiers such as SVM, KNN, Decision tree, and Naive Bayes are used in the proposed model. From the experiments, we found that the usage of KNN (base classifier) and SVM (meta classifier) with the combination of CNN in the proposed model outperform the other algorithms. This paper uses 2015 and 2016 Nepal and Italy earthquake datasets for experimentation. The experimental results proved that the proposed model achieves the best accuracy compared to baseline methods.","Madichetty, Sreenivasulu; M., Sridevi",Multimed Tools Appl,347,22

This access provides an unprecedented opportunity for data science technologies to derive data-driven insights and improve the quality of care delivery. Healthcare data, however, are usually fragmented and private making it difficult to generate robust results across populations. For example, different hospitals own the electronic health records (EHR) of different patient populations and these records are difficult to share across hospitals because of their sensitive nature. This creates a big barrier for developing effective analytical approaches that are generalizable, which need diverse, “big data.” Federated learning, a mechanism of training a shared global model with a central server while keeping all the sensitive data in local institutions where the data belong, provides great promise to connect the fragmented healthcare data sources with privacy-preservation. The goal of this survey is to provide a review for federated learning technologies, particularly within the biomedical space. In particular, we summarize the general solutions to the statistical challenges, system challenges, and privacy issues in federated learning, and point out the implications and potentials in healthcare.","Xu, Jie; Glicksberg, Benjamin S.; Su, Chang; Walker, Peter; Bian, Jiang; Wang, Fei",J Healthc Inform Res,347,1

The influence of treatment delay on treatment effect is not yet known. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the influence of time from stroke onset to the start of treatment and from stroke onset to reperfusion on the effect of IAT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) was a multicenter, randomized clinical open-label trial of IAT vs no IAT in 500 patients. The time to the start of treatment was defined as the time from onset of symptoms to groin puncture (TOG). The time from onset of treatment to reperfusion (TOR) was defined as the time to reopening the vessel occlusion or the end of the procedure in cases for which reperfusion was not achieved. Data were collected from December 3, 2010, to June 3, 2014, and analyzed (intention to treat) from July 1, 2014, to September 19, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Main outcome was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score for functional outcome (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]). Multiple ordinal logistic regression analysis estimated the effect of treatment and tested for the interaction of time to randomization, TOG, and TOR with treatment. The effect of treatment as a risk difference on reaching independence (mRS score, 0-2) was computed as a function of TOG and TOR. Calculations were adjusted for age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, previous stroke, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, and intracranial arterial terminus occlusion. RESULTS Among 500 patients (58% male; median age, 67 years), the median TOG was 260 (interquartile range [IQR], 210-311) minutes; median TOR, 340 (IQR, 274-395) minutes. An interaction between TOR and treatment (P = .04) existed, but not between TOG and treatment (P = .26). The adjusted risk difference (95% CI) was 25.9% (8.3%-44.4%) when reperfusion was reached at 3 hours, 18.8% (6.6%-32.6%) at 4 hours, and 6.7% (0.4%-14.5%) at 6 hours. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE For every hour of reperfusion delay, the initially large benefit of IAT decreases; the absolute risk difference for a good outcome is reduced by 6% per hour of delay. Patients with acute ischemic stroke require immediate diagnostic workup and IAT in case of intracranial arterial vessel occlusion.

Modern treatment of brain AVMs is a multimodality endeavor, requiring a multidisciplinary team with expertise in cerebrovascular neurosurgery, endovascular intervention, and radiation therapy in order to provide all therapeutic options and determine the most appropriate treatment regimen depending on patient characteristics and AVM morphology. Current therapeutic options include microsurgical resection, radiosurgery (focused radiation), and endovascular embolization. Endovascular embolization is primarily used as a preoperative adjuvant before microsurgery or radiosurgery. Palliative embolization has been used successfully to reduce the risk of hemorrhage, alleviate clinical symptoms, and preserve or improve neurological function in inoperable or nonradiosurgical AVMs. Less frequently, embolization is used as 'primary therapy' particularly for smaller, surgically difficult lesions. Current embolic agents used to treat brain AVMs include both solid and liquid agents. Liquid agents including N-butyl cyanoacrylate and Onyx are the most commonly used agents. As newer embolic agents become available and as microcatheter technology improves, the role of endovascular treatment for brain AVMs will likely expand.","Bruno, Charles A; Meyers, Philip M",Interventional neurology,347,30

Enhanced resolution of shock may improve outcomes. We aim to determine whether adding hemodynamic monitoring with continual transesophageal echocardiography (hTEE) to usual care accelerates resolution of hemodynamic instability. METHODS 550 patients with circulatory shock were randomly assigned to four groups stratified using hTEE (hTEE vs usual care) and assessment frequency (minimum every 4 h vs 8 h). Primary outcome was time to resolution of hemodynamic instability, analyzed as intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis at day 6 and in a predefined secondary analysis at days 3 and 28. RESULTS Of 550 randomized patients, 271 with hTEE and 274 patients with usual care were eligible and included in the ITT analysis. Time to resolution of hemodynamic instability did not differ within the first 6 days [hTEE vs usual care adjusted sub-hazard ratio (SHR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-1.46, p = 0.067]. Time to resolution of hemodynamic instability during the 72 h of hTEE monitoring was shorter in patients with TEE (hTEE vs usual care SHR 1.26, 95% CI 1.02-1.55, p = 0.034). Assessment frequency had no influence. Time to resolution of clinical signs of hypoperfusion, duration of organ support, length of stay and mortality in the intensive care unit and hospital, and mortality at 28 days did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS In critically ill patients with shock, hTEE monitoring or hemodynamic assessment frequency did not influence resolution of hemodynamic instability or mortality within the first 6 days.

Despite this, there has historically been a paucity of rehabilitation interventions to support women with breast cancer to maintain or return to their work role. The aim of this systematic review was to examine key characteristics of rehabilitation interventions, and their effectiveness on work outcomes for women with breast cancer, compared to usual care. METHODS A systematic review was conducted of controlled studies of rehabilitation interventions with work outcomes for women with breast cancer. Six databases were systematically searched: EMBASE, Web of Science, MEDLINE (OVID), CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Results are presented either as pooled odds ratio (OR) or pooled effect size (hedges g) between groups, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Narrative synthesis was conducted on intervention outcomes not suitable for meta-analysis. RESULTS Five thousand, five hundred and thirty-five studies were identified. Nine out of 28 abstracts met inclusion criteria. Heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes precluded meta-analysis for most outcomes. Of the interventions included in meta-analysis, no significant differences compared to usual care were found for sick leave (2 studies (12 months); OR 1.11 (95% CI: 0.66 to 1.87), number of sick days taken (2 studies (six months); difference in effect: - 0.08, (95% CI: - 0.48 to 0.38) or working hours (2 studies (12 months); 0.19, (95% CI: - 0.20 to 0.64). Only one study, with a multidisciplinary intervention, showed a significant difference for work outcomes when compared to usual care. Work-specific content featured in three interventions only, none of which provided conclusive evidence for improvement in work outcomes. Enhanced physical and psychological sequalae, and quality of life was observed in some studies. CONCLUSION There remains a lack of effective and methodologically rigorous rehabilitation intervention studies for breast cancer survivors. The development and evaluation of effective rehabilitation interventions to support return to work is warranted.","Algeo, Naomi; Bennett, Kathleen; Connolly, Deirdre",BMC cancer,347,1

METHODS This prospective, longitudinal cohort study recruited 68 consecutive SSc patients (group #1: 32 established disease (ACR, American College of Rheumatology /EULAR, The European League against Rheumatism 2013 and ACR 1980 criteria fulfilled); group #2: 24 early disease (only ACR/EULAR 2013 fulfilled); group #3: 12 very early disease (clinical expert diagnosis of SSc) and 72 healthy controls. HRM evaluated esophageal motility for water swallows and a solid test meal. RESULTS Systemic sclerosis patients had less frequent effective esophageal contractions during the test meal compared to healthy controls even in very early disease (0.15, 1.0, 2.1 per minute for groups #1, #2, and #3, vs 2.5 per minute in health; P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.0085, respectively). Ineffective motility at HRM was associated with a higher modified Rodnan skin score at baseline. Moreover, at mean 18 (10-31) months of follow-up, the presence of ineffective motility at baseline was associated with progression of skin disease (P = 0.01). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis identified hypotensive peristalsis in the test meal (<15% effective solid swallows) and low distal contractile integral (DCI; <400 mm Hg·cm·s) as predictors for skin aggravation, but not for new organ involvement. CONCLUSION Ineffective motility during a test meal is present already in patients with very early SSc. Findings on HRM studies are associated with disease severity at baseline, and low percentage of effective swallows in test meal and low mean DCI are both predictors of skin progression during follow-up.","Bütikofer, Simon; Jordan, Suzana; Sauter, Matthias; Hollenstein, Michael; Heinrich, Henriette; Freitas-Queiroz, Natália; Kuntzen, Thomas; Ang, Daphne; Oberacher, Marcos; Maurer, Britta; Schwizer, Werner; Fox, Mark; Distler, Oliver; Misselwitz, Benjamin",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,347,6

Mental health research on refugees and asylum seekers has burgeoned over the past two decades with epidemiological studies, accounts of the lived experience, new conceptual frameworks, and advances in understanding of effective treatment and intervention. However, there are substantial gaps in available research, and important ethical and methodological challenges. These include: the need to adopt decolonizing, participatory methods that amplify refugee voices; the further development of frameworks for studying the broad impacts of forced migration that go beyond posttraumatic stress disorder; and more translational research informed by longitudinal studies of the course of refugee adaptation. Keeping a human rights advocacy perspective front and center will allow researchers to work in collaborative ways with both refugee communities and receiving societies to develop innovative mental health policy and practice to meet the urgent need for a global response to the challenge of forced migration, which is likely to grow dramatically in the coming years as a result of the impacts of climate change.","Kronick, Rachel; Jarvis, G Eric; Kirmayer, Laurence J",Transcultural psychiatry,347,26

Difference in response distributions between groups with different demographics was tested by Pearson χ2 test. Instead of advocating for advanced toilet facilities, respondents were mostly concerned about basic hygiene issues. Malfunctioning facilities resulting from poor toilet management, such as clogged toilets, stained facilities, and problematic flushing systems, were most cited as barriers to toilet hygiene practices. Three quarters of the survey respondents expressed concerns over worn and poorly maintained toilets, shortage of janitors, and cleansing supplies. However, respondents who were older (P < .001), less educated (P < .001), and had lower income (P = .001) were significantly more likely to find hygiene conditions in public toilets satisfactory.

The heterogeneous vascular architecture of each rAVM determines the endovascular treatment techniques employed. We reported our experience with the endovascular treatment of a series of rAVMs. MATERIALS This retrospective study consisted of 12 patients with 12 rAVMs who underwent renal arterial embolization (RAE) in our hospital. Embolic materials, including particles, liquid embolic agents (n-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate, Onyx, and ethanol), and coils, were selectively used based on the decisions of interventional radiologists. Technical success was defined as the complete occlusion of the feeding arteries and nidus on postprocedure renal arteriography. Clinical success was defined as the resolution of hematuria or the disappearance of rAVM-relevant symptoms. RESULTS The median follow-up period was 13.5 months (range: 4-72). The technical success based on 12 procedures in 12 patients was 83.3% (10 of 12). In the 2 procedures that technically failed, the existence of multiple fine feeding arteries arising from the proximal portion of different segmental renal arteries explains the incomplete embolization. One of the 2 patients achieved clinical success without additional RAE. The other patient had recurrent hematuria 25 months after initial treatment, which was successfully managed conservatively with hemostatic agents. Thus, the clinical success was 91.7% (11 of 12). CONCLUSIONS Renal artery embolization with the selective use of various embolic materials is an effective treatment for patients with rAVMs. The existence of multiple fine feeding vessels arising from the proximal portion of different segmental renal arteries is likely to affect the technical success of treatment.","Jia, Zhen-Yu; Zhou, Chun-Gao; Xia, Jin-Guo; Zhao, Lin-Bo; Zhang, Wen; Liu, Sheng; Shi, Hai-Bin",Vascular and endovascular surgery,347,33

The aim of this study was to evaluate the protection of organic and conventional purple grape juices in brain, liver, and plasma from adult Wistar rats (7 months old) against the oxidative damage provoked by carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)). Adult rats were divided into three groups (control, conventional purple grape juice, and organic purple grape juice). Half of the rats received CCl(4), and the other half received the vehicle (vegetable oil). The chemical analytical determination showed that the highest levels of total phenolic, resveratrol, and catechins were seen in organic purple grape juices. Considering the treatment groups, it was observed that in all tissues (brain structures and liver) and plasma, CCl(4) treatment increased the lipid peroxidation (LP) levels. Both grape juices were capable to reduce LP levels in cerebral cortex and hippocampus; however, in the striatum and substantia nigra only the organic grape juice reduced LP level. CCl(4) caused an increase in catalase activity in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and substantia nigra and in superoxide dismutase activity in substantia nigra. This increase was reduced by both juices in substantia nigra and hippocampus structures (P < .05). In the alkaline version of the comet assay performed on whole blood, it was observed that CCl(4) was capable of inducing mainly DNA damage class 4 and 3 frequencies, which was significantly reduced in groups that received both purple grape juices. This implies that both grape juices have an important antigenotoxic activity.","Dani, Caroline; Oliboni, Lívia S; Umezu, Fernanda M; Pasquali, Matheus A B; Salvador, Mirian; Moreira, José Cláudio Fonseca; Henriques, João Antonio Pegas",Journal of medicinal food,347,1

A retrospective cluster study was conducted to evaluate long-term sexual and urinary functioning after RARP and Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy (LRP) based on real-world data from 12 Dutch hospitals. METHODS Data was collected from patients who underwent surgery between 2010 and 2012. A mixed effect model was used to evaluate differences between groups on urinary and sexual functioning (EPIC-26). Additionally, a regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between these functional outcomes and, among others, hospital volume. RESULTS 1370 (65.1%) patients participated, 907 underwent RARP and 463 LRP, with a median follow-up time of 7.08 years (SD = 0.98). The RARP group showed a statistically and clinically significant better urinary functioning compared to the LRP group (p = 0.002). RARP showed also a shorter procedure time (p=<0.001), reduced blood loss (p=<0.001), and a higher chance of neurovascular bundle preservation (39.8% vs 29.1%; p=<0.01). CONCLUSION RARP resulted in better long-term urinary function compared to LRP.

Given the increased adoption of virtual care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to review the effectiveness of virtual preoperative assessment for the evaluation of surgical patients. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING MEDLINE (Ovid), MEDLINE InProcess/ePubs, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from the initial coverage of the respective database to May 2021. A manual citation search of Google Scholar and PubMed was conducted to identify missed articles. Continued literature surveillance was done through July 2021. PATIENTS Patients aged 18 years and older undergoing virtual preoperative anesthesia assessment. INTERVENTIONS Virtual preoperative assessment. MEASUREMENTS Surgery cancellation rates, patient experience, resources saved, staff experience, success in using the data collected to diagnose and manage patients. MAIN RESULTS Fifteen studies (n = 31,496 patients) were included in this review. The average age of patients was 58 ± 15 years, and 47% were male. Virtual preoperative assessment resulted in similar surgery cancellation rates compared to in-person evaluation, with a pooled cancellation rate of 2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1-3%). Most studies reported a positive patient experience, with a pooled estimate of 90% (95% CI, 81-95%). There was a high success rate in using the information collected with virtual care, in the range of 92-100%, to diagnose and manage patients resulting in time and cost savings in the range of 24-137 min and $60-67 per patient. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates the utility of virtual care for preoperative assessment of surgical patients. Virtual preanesthesia evaluation had similar surgery cancellation rates, high patient satisfaction, and reduced costs compared to in-person evaluation.","Zhang, Kevin; Rashid-Kolvear, Matin; Waseem, Rida; Englesakis, Marina; Chung, Frances",Journal of clinical anesthesia,347,11

Moreover, PPCs are associated with poor prognosis after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for lobectomy. We compared the effects of two reversal agents, sugammadex and neostigmine, on the incidence of PPCs and duration of hospital stay in patients undergoing VATS lobectomy. Methods After VATS lobectomy was completed under neuromuscular monitoring, the sugammadex group (n = 46) received sugammadex 2 mg/kg, while the neostigmine group (n = 47) received neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg with atropine 0.02 mg/kg after at least the third twitch in response to the train of four stimulation. The primary outcome was incidence of PPCs. The secondary outcomes were duration of hospital stay and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Results There was no significant difference in the incidence of PPCs for both the sugammadex and neostigmine groups (32.6% and 40.4%, respectively; risk difference = 0.08; 95% confidence interval = [-0.12, 0.27]; P = 0.434). The lengths of hospital (P = 0.431) and ICU (P = 0.964) stays were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusions The clinical use of sugammadex and neostigmine in NMB reversal for patients undergoing VATS lobectomy was not significantly different in the incidence of PPCs and duration of hospital and ICU stay.","Lee, Tae Young; Jeong, Seong Yeop; Jeong, Joon Ho; Kim, Jeong Ho; Choi, So Ron",Anesthesia and pain medicine,347,1

Since the heart and the vessels also express ACE2, they both could become targets of the virus. However, at present the extent and importance of this potential involvement are unknown. Cardiac troponin levels are significantly higher in patients with more severe infections, patients admitted to intensive care units or in those who have died. In the setting of COVID-19, myocardial injury, defined by an increased troponin level, occurs especially due to non-ischaemic myocardial processes, including severe respiratory infection with hypoxia, sepsis, systemic inflammation, pulmonary thrombosis and embolism, cardiac adrenergic hyperstimulation during cytokine storm syndrome, and myocarditis. At present, there are limited reports on definite diagnosis of myocarditis caused by SARS-CoV-2 in humans and limited demonstration of the virus in the myocardium. In conclusion, although the heart and the vessels are potential targets in COVID-19, there is currently limited evidence on the direct infection of the myocardium by SARS-CoV-2. Additional pathological studies and autopsy series will be very helpful to clarify the potentiality of COVID-19 to directly infect the myocardium and cause myocarditis.","Imazio, Massimo; Klingel, Karin; Kindermann, Ingrid; Brucato, Antonio; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe; Adler, Yehuda; De Ferrari, Gaetano Maria",Heart,347,1

In small intestinal mucosa, ACE2 mRNA expression appears to increase with age and to display higher levels in patients taking ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I). There, ACE2 protein heterodimerizes with the neutral amino acid transporter Broad neutral Amino acid Transporter 1 (B0AT1) (SLC6A19) or the imino acid transporter Sodium-dependent Imino Transporter 1 (SIT1) (SLC6A20), associations that are required for the surface expression of these transport proteins. These heterodimers can form quaternary structures able to function as binding sites for SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins. The heterodimerization of the carboxypeptidase ACE2 with B0AT1 is suggested to favor the direct supply of substrate amino acids to the transporter, but whether this association impacts the ability of ACE2 to mediate viral infection is not known. B0AT1 mutations cause Hartnup disorder, a condition characterized by neutral aminoaciduria and, in some cases, pellagra-like symptoms, such as photosensitive rash, diarrhea, and cerebellar ataxia. Correspondingly, the lack of ACE2 and the concurrent absence of B0AT1 expression in small intestine causes a decrease in l-tryptophan absorption, niacin deficiency, decreased intestinal antimicrobial peptide production, and increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice. Thus, the abundant expression of ACE2 in small intestine and its association with amino acid transporters appears to play a crucial role for the digestion of peptides and the absorption of amino acids and, thereby, for the maintenance of structural and functional gut integrity.","Camargo, Simone M R; Vuille-Dit-Bille, Raphael N; Meier, Chantal F; Verrey, François",Clinical science,347,19

METHODS Participants included veterinary students at the beginning (group S1) and end (group S2) of their 2-week anaesthesia rotation and veterinary anaesthetists (group A). The feline airway simulator was designed to simulate an average size feline trachea, intubated with a 4.5 mm low-pressure, high-volume cuffed endotracheal tube, connected to a Bain breathing system with oxygen flow of 2 L minute-1. Participants inflated the on-endotracheal tube cuff by pilot balloon palpation and by instilling the minimum occlusive volume (MOV) required for loss of airway leaks during manual ventilation. Intracuff pressures were measured by manometers obscured to participants and ideally were 20-30 cm H2O. Student t, Fisher exact, and Chi-squared tests were used where appropriate to analyse data (p < 0.05). RESULTS Participants were 12 students and eight anaesthetists. Measured intracuff pressures for palpation and MOV, respectively, were 19 ± 12 and 29 ± 19 cm H2O for group S1, 10 ± 5 and 20 ± 11 cm H2O for group S2 and 13 ± 6 and 29 ± 18 cm H2O for group A. All groups performed poorly at achieving intracuff pressures within the ideal range. There was no significant difference in intracuff pressures between techniques. Students administered lower (p = 0.02) intracuff pressures using palpation after their training. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE When using palpation and MOV for cuff inflation operators rarely achieved optimal intracuff pressures. Experience had no effect on this skill and, as such, a cuff manometer is recommended.","White, Donna M; Redondo, José I; Mair, Alastair R; Martinez-Taboada, Fernando",Veterinary anaesthesia and analgesia,347,29

The existence of mechanisms controlling the encounter of gametes would be highly expedient in this case. By analogy with other species for which guidance was demonstrated, it is likely that this control may be performed by ovarian fluid or substances released by eggs. The aim was to study the effect of ovarian fluid and egg-released substances on spermatozoa behavior in sterlet. It was found that the presence of a particular concentration of ovarian fluid (30% solution in water) had an inhibiting effect on spermatozoa motility initiation. Lower concentrations of the ovarian fluid improved the longevity of spermatozoa and did not affect their trajectories. Test of chemotactic response (using a microcapillary injection of fluids into the suspension of motile spermatozoa) showed no effect of ovarian fluid on spermatozoa behavior, while at the same time, the attracting effect of the egg-conditioned medium was evident (i.e., due to some substances released from the eggs during their contact with freshwater). The results of the fertilization test showed that the presence of ovarian fluid prevented the eggs from losing the fertilizing ability due to the contact with water, as well as promoted the spermatozoa to fertilize the eggs during a longer period of time. Thus, the combined physicochemical action of ""female factors"" affects sterlet gametes during fertilization and may be involved in the guidance and selection mechanisms.","Kholodnyy, Vitaliy; Dzyuba, Borys; Gadêlha, Hermes; Cosson, Jacky; Boryshpolets, Sergii",Fish physiology and biochemistry,347,31

METHOD Records of 53 patients who had an ELAPE with reconstruction of the pelvic floor with a Permacol® mesh between August 2007 and August 2011 were reviewed. Thirty-one of the patients were called for interview and clinical examination. RESULTS Three (6%) patients developed perineal hernia, 11 had fistulae (nine of which were treated successfully), four patients had a perineal abscess and four patients had superficial wound infections. Removal of the mesh was necessary in one case, while another patient needed implantation of a new mesh. In 13 of the 31 interviewed patients, long-term pain was present, but resolved after a median of 8 months (3-56). No major sitting or movement disabilities were encountered. Three-year survival was 82%, and no local recurrences were found. CONCLUSION Pelvic floor reconstruction with a biological mesh is a feasible solution when performing ELAPE for low rectal cancer, although long-term pain is a frequent complication.","Jensen, K K; Rashid, L; Pilsgaard, B; Møller, P; Wille-Jørgensen, P",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,347,5

Serum samples taken at various times were tested for IgG and IgM; dynamic serological changes in these antibodies were described. The positive responses of IgM and IgG antibodies in sera against SARS virus from the first week to the sixth week after onset of the illness in patients with SARS were measured. The ELISA test of IgG antibody was negative in 200 community controls. The positive rate in the SARS high-risk population was 0.61% tested by ELISA and 0.21% by IFA. The high-risk population in this study was defined as those who provided health care and other services to SARS patients during the outbreak. IgG antibody in convalescent serum of patients with SARS revealed an increasing trend, peaking at the 22nd week after onset of illness followed by a slow decline. IgM appeared earlier than IgG and can be better used for early detection. IgG remained at a high level for a much longer period, serving as a good indicator for follow-up and for assessing past exposure. Our results also suggest that sub-clinical infection, if it exists, is very rare.","Yang, Zhen; Wang, Shixin; Li, Qian; Li, Yuming; Wei, Maoti; Gao, Hongsheng; Donovan, Catherine; Wang, Peizhong Peter",Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,347,24

We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and risk factors of pulmonary infection in elderly patients with heart failure, to provide reference to the prevention of pulmonary infection.This study was a retrospective study design. We included elderly heart failure patient admitted to our hospital from April 1, 2018 to August 31, 2020. The characteristics and clinical data of pulmonary infection and no infection patients were assessed. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the risk factors of pulmonary infections in patients with heart failure.A total of 201 patients were included. The incidence of pulmonary infection in patients with heart failure was 23.88%. There were significant differences in the age, diabetes, New York Heart Association (NYHA) grade, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), C-reactive protein (CRP) between infection and no infection group (all P < .05), and there were not differences in the sex, body mass index, alcohol drinking, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, length of hospital stay between 2 groups (all P > .05). Logistic regression analyses indicated that age ≥70 years, diabetes, NYHA grade III, LVEF ≤55%, and CRP ≥10 mg/L were the independent risk factors of pulmonary infections in patients with heart failure (all P < .05). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (34.48%), Staphylococcus aureus (19.57%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.22%) were the most common 3 pathogens in patients with pulmonary infection.Heart failure patients with age ≥70 years, diabetes, NYHA grade III, LVEF ≤55%, and CRP ≥10 mg/L have higher risks of pulmonary infections, preventive measures targeted on those risk factors are needed to reduce pulmonary infections.","Peng, Qi; Yang, Qin",Medicine,347,11

Drawing on ideas from institutional ethnography together with discourse analysis, this discussion highlights public textual discourses about nurses' salaries in Canadian news stories. The media discourse was found to distort the issues by focusing attention on nurses. Recognizing how these textual distortions mediate and construct messages is important in understanding how nurses and their work are constructed in the media. This discussion seeks to inform readers about how nurses are situated within commonly circulated discourses in the media. It also seeks to contribute to the literature about the nurse's image and how nurses and their work are portrayed in the public realm.

Previous characterization of mouse models of melioidosis have demonstrated that BALB/c mice present with an acute infection, whereas C57BL/6 mice have shown a tendency to be more resistant to infection and may model chronic disease. In this study, either BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice were exposed to aerosolized human clinical isolates of B. pseudomallei. The bacterial strains included HBPUB10134a (virulent isolate from Thailand), MSHR5855 (virulent isolate from Australia), and 1106a (relatively attenuated isolate from Thailand). The LD50 values were calculated and serial sample collections were performed in order to examine the bacterial burdens in tissues, histopathological features of disease, and the immune response mounted by the mice after exposure to aerosolized B. pseudomallei. These data will be important when utilizing these models for testing novel medical countermeasures.

A well-implemented respiratory protection program can protect health care workers from these exposures. This study examines the relationship between written respiratory programs and reported practices in health care settings. Twenty-eight hospitals in Illinois and Minnesota were recruited to a study of respiratory protection programs and practices in acute care settings. Interviews were conducted with hospital managers, unit managers, and health care workers from departments where respirators are commonly required. Each hospital's written respiratory protection program was scored for the 11 elements required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), using a standardized tool, for a maximum possible score of 22 (2 pts. per element). Twenty interview questions associated with program practices were also scored by percent correct responses. Written program scores ranged from 2-17 with an average of 9.2. Hospital and unit managers scored on average 82% and 81%, respectively, when compared to the OSHA standard; health care workers scored significantly lower, 71% (p < 0.001). Minnesota written program scores were not significantly higher than Illinois hospitals (p = 0.16), while all Illinois survey respondents scored higher than those in Minnesota (p < 0.001). There was no trend between written programs and interview responses. Written respiratory protection programs in the study sites did not provide the level of detail required OSHA.

This systematic review investigated the diagnostic performance of AOBP and MOBP using ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) as reference. Several databases including MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and China Academic Journals were searched. Data were extracted, double-checked by two investigators, and were analysed using a random effects model. RECENT FINDINGS A total of 26 observational studies were included. The mean systolic/diastolic BP obtained by AOBP was not significantly different from that obtained by ABPM. The sensitivity and specificity of AOBP to detect elevated BP were approximately 70%. Fewer participants had white-coat hypertension on AOBP measurement than on MOBP measurement (7% versus 14%); however, about 13% had masked hypertension on AOBP measurement. The width of the limit of agreement comparing (i) AOBP and ABPM and (ii) MOBP and ABPM was comparable. AOBP may reduce the rate of the observed white-coat effect but undermine masked hypertension. The current recommendation, however, is limited by the absence of high-quality studies and the high heterogeneity of our results. More high-quality studies using different AOBP machines and in different population are therefore needed.","Bo, Yacong; Kwok, Kin-On; Chu, Kareen Ka-Yin; Leung, Eppie Yu-Han; Yu, Chun Pong; Wong, Samuel Yeung-Shan; Lee, Eric Kam-Pui",Current hypertension reports,347,6

Therefore, early detection of the viral aetiologies of ARTIs is essential for patient management and infection control. In this study, we evaluated the performance of a new multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel [RVP] Fast v2) in the detection of respiratory viruses by comparing it with that of viral culture and direct immunofluorescence (IF) staining. Methods Nasopharyngeal swab and aspirate samples were collected prospectively from 199 patients who presented with ARTIs at the University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia during a 10-month period. The PCR assay was conducted in parallel with conventional culture and direct IF staining methods. Results The positive rate of the xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay (78.4%) in detecting respiratory viruses was higher than that of the viral isolation (7.5%) and direct IF (23.1%) methods. Using the xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay, human enterovirus/human rhinovirus (HEV/HRV) was the most frequently detected (46.2%). The xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay revealed mixed infection caused by two or three respiratory viruses in 40 specimens, and these were undetected by the viral isolation and direct IF methods. Conclusion The xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay was superior to conventional methods in the identification of common respiratory viruses, with higher sensitivity and shorter turnaround times for laboratory results.","Kuan, Chee Sian; Yew, Su Mei; Hooi, Poh Sim; Lee, Lu Mei; Ng, Kee Peng",The Malaysian journal of medical sciences : MJMS,347,1

METHODS We analyzed potential clinical and procedural risk factors associated with 2049 TLE procedures. The TLEs were performed between 2006 and 2016 using only simple tools for lead extraction. Logistic regression analysis was used to develop a risk prediction scoring system for TLEs. RESULTS Multivariate analysis showed that the sum of lead dwell times, anemia, female gender, the number of procedures preceding TLE, and removal of leads implanted in patients under the age of 30 had a significant influence on the occurrence of major complications during a TLE. This information served as a basis for developing a predictive SAFeTY TLE score, where: S = sum of lead dwell times, A = anemia, Fe = female, T = treatment (previous procedures), Y = young patients, and TLE = transvenous lead extraction. In order to facilitate the use of the SAFeTY TLE Score, a simple calculator was constructed. CONCLUSION The SAFeTY TLE score is easy to calculate and predicts the potential occurrence of procedure-related major complications. High-risk patients (scoring more than 10 on the SAFeTY TLE scale) must be treated at high-volume centers with surgical backup.","Jacheć, Wojciech; Polewczyk, Anna; Polewczyk, Maciej; Tomasik, Andrzej; Kutarski, Andrzej",Journal of clinical medicine,347,30

Here, we quantify the response of the yeast proteome to low temperature (LT), a condition where aberrant mis-paired RNA folding intermediates accumulate. We show that, at LT, yeast cells globally boost production of their ribosome assembly machinery. We find that the LT-induced assembly factor, Puf6, binds to the nascent catalytic RNA-rich subunit interface within the 60S pre-ribosome, at a site that eventually loads the nuclear export apparatus. Ensemble Förster resonance energy transfer studies show that Puf6 mimics the role of Mg2+ to usher a unique long-range tertiary contact to compact rRNA. At LT, puf6 mutants accumulate 60S pre-ribosomes in the nucleus, thus unveiling Puf6-mediated rRNA compaction as a critical temperature-regulated rescue mechanism that counters rRNA misfolding to prime export competence.","Gerhardy, Stefan; Oborská-Oplová, Michaela; Gillet, Ludovic; Börner, Richard; van Nues, Rob; Leitner, Alexander; Michel, Erich; Petkowski, Janusz J; Granneman, Sander; Sigel, Roland K O; Aebersold, Ruedi; Panse, Vikram Govind",Nature communications,347,28

We conducted an analysis of diverse perspectives from stakeholders regarding how to trade off risks and benefits to patients, healthcare providers, and the local community. Our findings indicate that there are a large number of different categories of stakeholders impacted by the post-pandemic decisions to reschedule delayed treatments and surgeries. For a delayed surgery, the primary stakeholders are the surgeon with expertise about the clinical benefits of undergoing an operation and the patient's willingness to tolerate uncertainty and the increased risk of infection. For decisions about how much capacity in the operating rooms and in the inpatient setting after the surgery, the primary considerations are minimizing staff infections, preventing patients from getting COVID-19 during operations and during post-surgical recovery at the hospital, conserving critical resources such as PPE, and meeting the needs of hospital staff for quality of life, such as child care needs and avoiding infecting members of their household. The timing and selection of elective surgery cases has an impact on the ability of hospitals to steward finances, which in turns affects decisions about maintaining employment of staff when operating rooms and inpatient rooms are not being used.","Patterson, Emily S; Papautsky, Elizabeth Lerner; Krok-Schoen, Jessica L; Lee, Clara; Park, Ko Un; White, Julia R; Moffatt-Bruce, Susan; Chirumamilla, Varshita; Lustberg, Maryam",Proceedings of the International Symposium of Human Factors and Ergonomics in Healthcare.

We aimed to characterize and compare consent rates for neonatal randomized controlled trials in low- and lower middle-income countries versus high-income countries, and to evaluate the influence of study characteristics on consent rates. METHODS In this systematic review, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane for randomized controlled trials of neonatal interventions in low- and lower middle-income countries or high-income countries published 01/01/2013 to 01/04/2018. Our primary outcome was consent rate, the proportion of eligible participants who consented amongst those approached, extracted from the article or email with the author. Using a generalised linear model for fractional dependent variables, we analysed the odds of consenting in low- and lower middle-income countries versus high-income countries across control types and interventions. FINDINGS We screened 3523 articles, yielding 300 eligible randomized controlled trials with consent rates available for 135 low- and lower middle-income country trials and 65 high-income country trials. Median consent rates were higher for low- and lower middle-income countries (95.6%; interquartile range (IQR) 88.2-98.9) than high-income countries (82.7%; IQR 68.6-93.0; p<0.001). In adjusted regression analysis comparing low- and lower middle-income countries to high-income countries, the odds of consent for no placebo-drug/nutrition trials was 3.67 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.87-7.19; p = 0.0002) and 6.40 (95%CI 3.32-12.34; p<0.0001) for placebo-drug/nutrition trials. CONCLUSION Neonatal randomized controlled trials in low- and lower middle-income countries report consistently higher consent rates compared to high-income country trials.

METHODS A systematic review of the literature was undertaken. RESULTS This abscess usually originates in the proctodeal glands of the intersphincteric space. A distinction is made between subanodermal, intersphincteric, ischioanal, and supralevator abscesses. The patient history and clinical examination are diagnostically sufficient to establish the indication for surgery. Further examinations (endosonography, MRI) should be considered in recurrent abscesses or supralevator abscesses. The timing of the surgical intervention is primarily determined by the patient's symptoms, and acute abscess is generally an indication for emergency treatment. Anal abscesses are treated surgically. The type of access (transrectal or perianal) depends on the abscess location. The goal of surgery is thorough drainage of the focus of infection while preserving the sphincter muscles. The wound should be rinsed regularly (using tap water). The use of local antiseptics is associated with a risk of cytotoxicity. Antibiotic treatment is only necessary in exceptional cases. Intraoperative fistula exploration should be conducted with extreme care if at all; no requirement to detect fistula should be imposed. The risk of abscess recurrence or secondary fistula formation is low overall, but they can result from insufficient drainage. Primary fistulotomy should only be performed in case of superficial fistulas and by experienced surgeons. In case of unclear findings or high fistulas, repair should take place in a second procedure. CONCLUSION In this clinical S3 guideline, instructions for diagnosis and treatment of anal abscess are described for the first time in Germany.","Ommer, Andreas; Herold, Alexander; Berg, Eugen; Fürst, Alois; Sailer, Marco; Schiedeck, Thomas",International journal of colorectal disease,347,31

However, the association of exercise with VLU healing has not been properly aggregated, and the effectiveness of different exercise interventions has not been characterized. Objective To summarize the association of different exercise interventions with VLU healing when used as an adjuvant to any form of compression. Data Sources The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and SCOPUS databases were searched through October 9, 2017. Study Selection Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of any exercise compared with no exercise in participants with VLU were included, where compression was used as standard therapy and a healing outcome was reported. Independent title screening and full text review by 2 authors (A.J., J.S.) with appeal to a third author (J.P.) if disagreement was unresolved. Of the 519 articles screened, a total of 6 (1.2%) studies met the inclusion criteria for systematic review, including 5 for meta-analysis. Data Extraction and Synthesis Independent quality assessment for Cochrane risk of bias and data extraction by 2 authors with appeal to third author if disagreement unresolved (PRISMA). Data pooled using fixed effects model. Main Outcomes and Measures The a priori primary outcome was any healing outcome (proportion healed, time to healing, or change in ulcer area). Secondary outcomes (adverse events, costs, and health-related quality of life) were only collected if a primary outcome was reported. Results Six RCTs were identified and 5 (190 participants) met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. The exercise interventions were progressive resistance exercise alone (2 RCTs, 53 participants) or combined with prescribed physical activity (2 RCTs, 102 participants), walking only (1 RCT, 35 participants), or ankle exercises (1 RCT, 40 participants). Overall, exercise was associated with increased VLU healing at 12 weeks although the effect was imprecise (additional 14 cases healed per 100 patients; 95% CI, 1-27 cases per 100; P = .04). The combination of progressive resistance exercise plus prescribed physical activity appeared to be most effective, again with imprecision (additional 27 cases healed per 100 patients; 95% CI, 9-45 cases per 100; P = .004). Conclusions and Relevance The evidence base may now be sufficiently suggestive for clinicians to consider recommending simple progressive resistance and aerobic activity to suitable patients with VLU while further research is produced.","Jull, Andrew; Slark, Julia; Parsons, John",JAMA dermatology,347,6

CCHF is transmitted by Hyalomma ticks through direct contact with the blood and other bodily fluids of patients or infected animals. Case description A 65-year-old man was admitted to the emergency unit with dry cough, myalgia and fever. He was treated with favipiravir. He had disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with thrombocytopenia in the setting of COVID-19 infection. He tested positive for both COVID-19 and CCHF. By the end of the fifth day of treatment, his laboratory parameters and clinical symptoms had normalized. Conclusion Favipiravir is currently on the market for treating COVID-19 infection worldwide. It has also been used to treat CCHF in laboratory animals. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of CCHF successfully treated with favipiravir, which could be a key drug for treating human CCHF. LEARNING POINTS Clinicians should be alert for concomitant viral infections such as Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, which share similar clinical and laboratory findings to COVID-19.The effectiveness of favipiravir for viral infections other than influenza and COVID-19, such as Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, should be elucidated.","Dülger, Ahmet Cumhur; Yakarişik, Mustafa; Uzun, Yusuf Emre; Şahin, Ahmet Melih",European journal of case reports in internal medicine,347,31

As part of the project a case record database was established to document prospective cases of snakebite presenting to Mandalay General Hospital, in Upper Myanmar. The study period was 12 months (1-2-2016 to 31-1-2017). Snake identity was based on a mixture of identified dead snakes brought with patients, doctor's clinical opinion and patient identification. 965 patients were enrolled during the 12 month period, of whom 948 were included for analysis. The male: female ratio was 1.58:1. Most cases involved bites to the lower limbs (82.5%) and adults involved in farm work, confirming snakebite as an occupational disease in this community. Motorised transport was by far the most common form of transport to health care and most patients sought care from the health system (87.7%), not traditional healers (11.5%) as their first point of contact. The officially promoted application of a pressure pad, bandage and immobilisation as first aid for snakebite was almost never used, while most patients used some form of tourniquet (92.0%). 85.4% of cases where a snake ID was listed were bitten by Russell's vipers. Russell's viper bites were responsible for all fatalities (9.8% of cases) and all cases of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). For all cases, clinical features included local swelling (76.5%), local pain (62.6%), AKI (59.8%), incoagulable blood (57.9%), regional lymphadenopathy (39.8%), nausea/vomiting (40.4%), thrombocytopenia (53.6%), abdominal pain (28.8%), shock (11.8%), secondary infection (8.6%), panhypopituitarism (2.1%). AKI required renal replacement therapy (RRT) in 23.9% of cases, all ascribed to Russell's viper bite. Green pit viper bites were the next most common cause of bites (7.6%) and were associated with incoagulable blood (29%) and occasionally shock (5%) and local necrosis (3%), and in one case AKI not requiring RRT. In contrast to Russell's viper bites, green pit viper bite was most likely to occur in the home (49%). Some green pit viper patients were treated with Russell's viper antivenom (15%), presumably because they had incoagulable blood, although this antivenom is not effective against green pit viper envenoming. For the entire patient group, antivenom was given in 80.5% of cases. The most common indications were presence of coagulopathy/non-clotting blood (59.8%), local swelling (47.4%), oliguria/anuria (19.8%), heavy proteinuria (19.4%). A febrile reaction to antivenom was reported in 47.9% of cases, while anaphylaxis, occurred in 7.9% of cases.","White, Julian; Alfred, Sam; Bates, David; Mahmood, Mohammad Afzal; Warrell, David; Cumming, Robert; Thwin, Khin Thida; Thein, Myat Myat; Thant, Myo; Naung, Zaw Myo; Naing, Ye Htet; San, Su Sint Sint; Nwe, Myat Thet; Peh, Chen Au",Toxicon: X,347,1

""doctor shopping""). The use of multiple prescribers is not a problem per se and can be legitimate, as when the patient's regular physician is not available or a concurrent painful condition is being cared for by a different practitioner. PURPOSE The primary objective of this study was to determine if those patients who used a few prescribers (two to five) in a 1-year period were distinguishable from those who used only one prescriber. METHODS We performed a secondary data analysis of the California Prescription Monitoring Program, the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System, by using data collected during 1999-2007. RESULTS The group who used a few providers (two to five) differed substantially from those who visited one provider over a 1-year period. However, the dissimilarity did not suggest that these patients were more prone to the abuse of opioids. CONCLUSIONS The decision not to investigate patients who visit a low number of multiple prescribers (two to five) appears to be justifiable. If the number of providers in a given period of time is used to determine if a patient should be challenged as being a ""doctor shopper,"" cutoffs with high specificity (low false-positive rates) should be chosen. Further epidemiologic research is needed to determine the association of the number of prescribers and misuse and/or abuse of opioids.","Wilsey, Barth L; Fishman, Scott M; Gilson, Aaron M; Casamalhuapa, Carlos; Baxi, Hassan; Lin, Tzu-Chun; Li, Chin-Shang",Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,347,28

However, co-detection of serum specific IgA for SARS-CoV-2 and common respiratory pathogens remains largely unexplored. This study utilizes a protein microarray technology for simultaneous and quantitative measurements of specific IgAs for 8 different respiratory pathogens including adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus type A, influenza virus type B, parainfluenza virus, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae and SARS-CoV-2 in serum sample of COVID-19 patients. A total of 42 COVID-19 patients were included and categorized into severe cases (20 cases) and non-severe cases (22 cases). The results showed that co-detection rate of specific-IgA for SARS-CoV-2 with at least one pathogen were significantly higher in severe cases than that of non-severe cases (72.2% vs. 46.2%, p=0.014). Our study indicates that co-detection of IgA antibodies for respiratory pathogens might provide diagnostic value for the clinics and also be informative for risk stratification and disease management in COVID-19 patients.

METHODS An electronic search on 3 databases from January 1965 to March of 2017 was done for human randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and prospective and retrospective cohort studies. The key words used in the search were: Bridge OR bridges OR fixed partial OR fixed dental AND resin bonded OR Maryland OR ceramic bonded. Quality assessment was done using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Success was defined as the RBFPDs remaining in situ and not having experienced debonding, biological failures, or mechanical failures at the examination visit. RESULTS Meta analyses of the included studies showed an estimated 5-year success rate of 88.18% for the metal framework RBFPDs and 84.41% for the nonmetal framework RBFPDs. The estimated 5-year success rate for each nonmetal material category was 92.07% for zirconia, 94.26% for In-Ceram alumina, and 84.83% for fiber-reinforced composite. The failure rate was not statistically significant among the single, double, and multiple retainers RBFPDs (P > .05). Technical complications were the main reason for failures. CONCLUSION The 5-year clinical performance of RBFPDs is similar to the performance of conventional fixed partial dentures (FPDs) and implant-supported crowns. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Clinicians should consider using RBFPDs more often because their clinical performance is similar to the performance of conventional FPDs and implant-supported crowns.","Alraheam, Islam Abd; Ngoc, Caroline Nguyen; Wiesen, Christopher A; Donovan, Terence E",Journal of esthetic and restorative dentistry : official publication of the American Academy of Esthetic Dentistry ...

DESIGN We applied a 2 × 2 between-participants factorial design with referral bonus and autonomous referral request as experimental variables. METHODS In May 2019, 110 nurses working in Belgian hospitals were shown a fictitious e-mail with a request from their employer to look for potential new-hires and filled out an online survey measuring referral likelihood and quality. RESULTS Promising a referral bonus did not affect nurses' referral likelihood and quality. Instead supporting self-determination theory, nurses exposed to the autonomous request were more likely to refer and assure referral quality than those exposed to the controlling request. CONCLUSION Hospitals can increase nurses' referral likelihood and quality by framing their referral request in an autonomy-supportive way.

In this observational study, the anatomical focus of the Bair-Hugger ZHF sensor was assessed in pre- and postoperative CT or MRI images of 29 patients undergoing elective craniotomy. Assuming the 2-cm depth from the forehead skin surface, the temperature measurement point preoperatively reached the brain cortex in all except one patient. Assuming the 1-cm depth, the preoperative temperature measurement point did not reach the brain parenchyma in any of the patients and was at the cortical surface in two patients. Corresponding results were obtained postoperatively, although either sub-arachnoid fluid or air was observed in all CT/MRI images. Craniotomy did not have a detectable effect on the course of the ZHF temperatures. In Bland-Altman analysis, the agreement of ZHF temperature with the nasopharyngeal temperature was 0.11 (95% confidence interval - 0.54 to 0.75) °C and with the bladder temperature - 0.14 (- 0.81 to 0.52) °C.

Early in the outbreak period, transplant societies recommended suspending living kidney transplant programs in communities with widespread transmission to avoid exposing recipients to increased risk of immunosuppression, while recommendations were made to reserve deceased-donor kidney transplantation for likely life-saving indications. SOT recipients may be at high risk from COVID-19 disease due to chronic immunosuppressive treatment and other medical comorbidities. Mortality rates reported between 13 to over 30% in SOT recipients. In addition to high rates of complications and mortality attributable to COVID-19 infections, the pandemic has also led to additional complexities in transplantation including new questions regarding screening of donors and recipients, decision making to accept a patient for kidney transplant or wait after pandemic. The clinical implications of COVID-19 infection may also differ depending on the type of the transplanted organ and recipient comorbidities which further impacts decisions on continuing transplantation during the pandemic. Transplant activity during a pandemic should be tailored with careful selection of both donors and recipients. Furthermore, while tremendous strides have been made in treatment strategies and vaccinations, the impact of these in transplant recipients may be attenuated in the setting of their immunosuppression.

Methods: At both time points, participants completed measures of loneliness and stress, as well as well-validated measures of depression and anxiety. Results: Prior to the pandemic, stress mediated the positive relationship between loneliness and depression. During the pandemic, mental health outcomes, stress, and loneliness all increased. Stress, but not loneliness, predicted college students' worse mental health outcomes during the pandemic. Conclusions: Stress plays a key role in college students' worsening mental health.

The vessel sealing ability of three devices in colorectal specimens was compared in an experimental study. METHODS Surgical specimens from patients scheduled for elective open or laparoscopic colorectal resection were allocated to one of the three devices. After removal of the surgical specimen, up to eight mesenteric vessels were dissected ex vivo and sealed using the allocated instrument. The vessel seal was tested for the maximum pressure at which it leaked and then assessed by a pathologist for depth of thermal tissue damage. RESULTS A total of 93 vessels from 18 patients were assessed ex vivo (LOTUS™ n = 33; Harmonic Ace® n = 30; LigaSure™ n = 30), a median of 6 (range 1-8) vessels per surgical specimen with a mean(s.d.) diameter of 1·06(0·70) mm and wall thickness of 0·29(0·19) mm. Mean(s.d.) bursting pressures were 1170(440), 1470(670) and 1510(740) mmHg with LOTUS(™) , Harmonic Ace® and LigaSure™ respectively. ANCOVA showed no difference in bursting pressure between the instruments (P = 0·058). The depth of thermal damage was significantly greater with LigaSure™ (3·37(1·44) mm) than with LOTUS(™) (2·18(0·99) mm; P < 0·001) or Harmonic Ace® (1·95(0·92) mm; P < 0·001). CONCLUSION All three instruments were equally good at sealing blood vessels, with bursting pressures well above physiological blood pressure levels.

The deterministic model is formulated by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that is built upon the classical SEIR framework. The stochastic model is formulated by a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) that is derived based on the ODE model with constant parameters. The nonlinear CTMC model is approximated by a multitype branching process to obtain an analytical estimate for the probability of a disease outbreak. The local and global dynamics of the disease are analyzed by using the deterministic model with constant parameters, and the result indicates that the basic reproduction number $ \mathcal{R}_0 $ serves as a sharp disease threshold: the disease dies out if $ \mathcal{R}_0\le 1 $ and persists if $ \mathcal{R}_0 > 1 $. In contrast to the deterministic dynamics, the stochastic dynamics indicate that the disease may not persist when $ \mathcal{R}_0 > 1 $. Parameter estimation and validation are performed to fit our ODE model to the public reported data. Our result indicates that both the exposed and infected classes play an important role in shaping the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. In addition, numerical simulations indicate that a second wave of the ongoing pandemic is likely to occur if the prevention and control strategies are not implemented properly.","Olabode, Damilola; Culp, Jordan; Fisher, Allison; Tower, Angela; Hull-Nye, Dylan; Wang, Xueying",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,347,33

RM is typically disposed in the sea, dams or dykes, posing a significant environmental hazard due to its high alkalinity and traces of heavy metals. Despite recent valorization efforts, only 15% of RM deposits are currently utilized. In this work, a novel use of RM to formulate composite phase change materials (CPCMs) is proposed. The CPCM is formulated by milling nitrate salts with RM, compressing and subsequent sintering of the two. Overall good performance over the temperature range of 25-400 ℃ is observed. Maximum latent heat of the CPCMs is 58 J/g, while average thermal conductivity and Cp are in the range of 0.77-0.83 W/mK and 1.03-1.31 J/g ℃, respectively. No variations in the melting point or latent heat are observed after 48 cycles. Energy storage density is calculated to be up to 1396 MJ/m3. The working temperature of this novel CPCM make it ideal for waste heat recovery of medium-high temperature waste heat streams providing a valorization pathway and valorization for RM as a by-product for energy-related applications.","Anagnostopoulos, Argyrios; Navarro, Maria Elena; Stefanidou, Maria; Ding, Yulong; Gaidajis, Georgios",Journal of hazardous materials,347,31

Not only China, the first country that experienced the health crisis since last December, but the rest of the world, is facing an unprecedented global health crisis, the most serious crisis in a century, with social and economic impact. However, the most important impact of the new pandemic is the human impact. Till 4th of June 2020, coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causing COVID-19 disease, has infected more than 65000.000 people and has been responsible for more than 386000 deaths globally. The first priority of public health authorities is to contain and mitigate the spread and infection rate of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, distributing the number of infections over time and, if possible, reduce the incidence of the disease (COVID-19) it causes. A critical task for health systems confronted with the spread of the coronavirus is to protect the health of all citizens, so this requires that both diagnosis/testing and appropriate care should be readily available, affordable, and provided in a safe environment. The health care systems of many developed countries failed to demonstrate a satisfactory response to the increased demand for acute care hospital beds, ventilators, emergency services, diagnostics tests, support equipment for their COVID-19 patients, availability of essential medicines, protective equipment for their staff etc. Nuclear Medicine (NM) departments and their staff, in spite of the fact that not being in the front line of the pandemic response, have experienced a dramatic alteration in their daily clinical activity, trying to adapt their clinical routine to the new environment. There are several issued guidance from national and international organizations, trying to help to cope with suspected or verified COVID-19 patients. Patients with cancer are thought to be more susceptible and have higher morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19 than the general population. In the current article, our aim is to present measures, guidance and thoughts that should be considered for the cancer patients.","Panagiotidis, Emmanouil",Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine,347,33

More than 95% of all studies on vitamin E are directed toward the specific study of alpha-tocopherol. The other forms of natural vitamin E remain poorly understood. The abundance of alpha-tocopherol in the human body and the comparable efficiency of all vitamin E molecules as antioxidants led biologists to neglect the non-tocopherol vitamin E molecules as topics for basic and clinical research. Recent developments warrant a serious reconsideration of this conventional wisdom. The tocotrienol subfamily of natural vitamin E possesses powerful neuroprotective, anticancer, and cholesterol-lowering properties that are often not exhibited by tocopherols. Current developments in vitamin E research clearly indicate that members of the vitamin E family are not redundant with respect to their biological functions. alpha-Tocotrienol, gamma-tocopherol, and delta-tocotrienol have emerged as vitamin E molecules with functions in health and disease that are clearly distinct from that of alpha-tocopherol. At nanomolar concentration, alpha-tocotrienol, not alpha-tocopherol, prevents neurodegeneration. On a concentration basis, this finding represents the most potent of all biological functions exhibited by any natural vitamin E molecule. Recently, it has been suggested that the safe dose of various tocotrienols for human consumption is 200-1000/day. A rapidly expanding body of evidence supports that members of the vitamin E family are functionally unique. In recognition of this fact, title claims in publications should be limited to the specific form of vitamin E studied. For example, evidence for toxicity of a specific form of tocopherol in excess may not be used to conclude that high-dosage ""vitamin E"" supplementation may increase all-cause mortality. Such conclusion incorrectly implies that tocotrienols are toxic as well under conditions where tocotrienols were not even considered. The current state of knowledge warrants strategic investment into the lesser known forms of vitamin E. This will enable prudent selection of the appropriate vitamin E molecule for studies addressing a specific health need.","Sen, Chandan K; Khanna, Savita; Rink, Cameron; Roy, Sashwati",Vitamins and hormones,347,1

Robust Th1-polarized anti-gD immune responses were demonstrated in the murine model as measured by induction of gD-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and increased gamma interferon expression. The isotype makeup of the serum anti-gD immunoglobulin G (IgG) response was consistent with the presence of a Th1-CD4+ anti-gD response, characterized by a high IgG2a/IgG1 IgG subclass ratio. Functional anti-HSV-2 neutralizing serum antibody responses were readily demonstrated in both guinea pigs and mice that had been immunized with rVSV-gD vaccines. Furthermore, guinea pigs and mice were prophylactically protected from genital challenge with high doses of wild-type HSV-2. In addition, guinea pigs were highly protected against the establishment of latent infection as evidenced by low or absent HSV-2 genome copies in dorsal root ganglia after virus challenge.

Currently, there are no effective therapies against smallpox and new treatment strategies are greatly needed. METHODS In this study, specifically designed small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), targeting five proteins essential for orthopoxvirus replication, were investigated for their ability to inhibit vaccinia virus strain Western Reserve (VACVWR) replication. RESULTS Among these siRNAs, 100 nM siD5R-2, an siRNA targeting the D5 protein, decreased VACVWR replication up to 90% when used either prophylactically or therapeutically in human lung carcinoma A549 cells. This siRNA induced a striking concentration-dependent inhibition of VACVWR replication and a prolonged prophylactic antiviral effect that lasted for 72 h, at a concentration of 100 nM. Confocal microscopy of Alexa-siD5R-2-treated VACVWR-infected cells confirmed a decrease in viral replication. Furthermore, siD5R-2 was shown to specifically reduce the D5R mRNA and protein expression using real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR and western blotting analysis, without inducing interferon-13 in A549 cells. We also demonstrated the antiviral potency of siD5R-2 against different pathogenic orthopoxviruses, such as cowpox and monkeypox viruses, which were inhibited up to 70% at the lowest concentration (1 nM) tested. Finally, siD5R-2 showed antiviral effects in VACVWR-infected human keratinocyte and fibroblast cell cultures. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that siD5R-2 could be a potential candidate to treat poxvirus infections.","Vigne, Solenne; Germi, Raphaële; Duraffour, Sophie; Larrat, Sylvie; Andrei, Graciela; Snoeck, Robert; Garin, Daniel; Crance, Jean-Marc",Antiviral therapy,347,1

The specificities were 99.5% [98.9,99.8] (CMIA), 99.7% [99.3,99.9] (LIA), and 99.9% [99.5,99.98] (ECLIA). The LR at half of the manufacturers' cut-offs were 60 (CMIA), 82 (LIA), and 575 (ECLIA) for positive and 0.043 (CMIA) and 0.035 (LIA, ECLIA) for negative results. ECLIA had higher PPV at low pretest probabilities than CMIA and LIA. No interference with EBV or CMV infection was observed, whereas endemic coronavirus in some cases provided signals in LIA and/or CMIA. Although the diagnostic accuracy of the three investigated assays is comparable, their performance in low-prevalence settings is different. Introducing gray zones at half of the manufacturers' cut-offs is suggested, especially for orthogonal testing approaches that use a second assay for confirmation.","Weber, Myriam C; Risch, Martin; Thiel, Sarah L; Grossmann, Kirsten; Nigg, Susanne; Wohlwend, Nadia; Lung, Thomas; Hillmann, Dorothea; Ritzler, Michael; Ferrara, Francesca; Bigler, Susanna; Egli, Konrad; Bodmer, Thomas; Imperiali, Mauro; Salimi, Yacir; Fleisch, Felix; Cusini, Alexia; Heer, Sonja; Renz, Harald; Paprotny, Matthias; Kohler, Philipp; Vernazza, Pietro; Risch, Lorenz; Kahlert, Christian R",Dis Markers,347,6

Many results have been described on the status of the immune system of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, but there are still aspects that have not been fully characterized or understood. In this study, we have analyzed a cohort of patients with mild, moderate and severe disease. We performed flow cytometric studies and correlated the data with the clinical characteristics and clinical laboratory values of the patients. Both conventional and unsupervised data analyses concluded that patients with severe disease are characterized, among others, by a higher state of activation in all T cell subsets (CD4, CD8, double negative and T follicular helper cells), higher expression of perforin and granzyme B in cytotoxic cells, expansion of adaptive NK cells and the accumulation of activated and immature dysfunctional monocytes which are identified by a low expression of HLA-DR and an intriguing shift in the expression pattern of CD300 receptors. More importantly, correlation analysis showed a strong association between the alterations in the immune cells and the clinical signs of severity. These results indicate that patients with severe COVID-19 have a broad perturbation of their immune system, and they will help to understand the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19.","Zenarruzabeitia, Olatz; Astarloa-Pando, Gabirel; Terrén, Iñigo; Orrantia, Ane; Pérez-Garay, Raquel; Seijas-Betolaza, Iratxe; Nieto-Arana, Javier; Imaz-Ayo, Natale; Pérez-Fernández, Silvia; Arana-Arri, Eunate; Borrego, Francisco",Front Immunol,347,2

METHOD: Students (n = 579) from a large Midwestern American university completed self-report questionnaires assessing frequency of ED behaviors, ED-related impairment, and individual food insecurity as measured by the Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale 5, Clinical Impairment Assessment, and Radimer/Cornell, respectively. Chi-square tests and MANOVA with post-hoc corrections were conducted to compare demographic characteristics, ED pathology, and probable ED diagnosis prevalence between students with and without individual food insecurity. RESULTS: Partially supporting hypotheses, MANOVA indicated significantly greater frequency of objective binge eating, compensatory fasting, and ED-related impairment for students with food insecurity compared with individuals without food insecurity. Chi-squared tests showed higher prevalence of ED diagnoses among individuals with food insecurity compared with those without food security (47.6 vs. 31.1%, respectively, p < .01, NNT = 6.06), specifically bulimia nervosa and other specified feeding and eating disorder. There were no differences in food insecurity before or during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hence, we sought to describe the clinical characteristics of dialysis patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: We reviewed clinical outcomes, which consisted of clinical data extracted from the medical records of 695 registered dialysis patients at the Dialysis Center of Central Hospital of Wuhan from January 13th, 2020, to February 29th, 2020, and performed statistical analysis. According to the results, there were 447, 227 and 21 hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) and combined HD and PD (HD&PD) cases, respectively. RESULTS: During the outbreak of COVID-19, 36 dialysis patients were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Among those 36 patients, 32 (7.2%) were on HD, and 4 (1.8%) were on PD. When comparing SARS-CoV-2 infection between HD and PD, the relative risk was 4.07 (RR = 4.07, 95% CI 1.46-11.35). We noted a median age of 66 years during the observation period, and the number of male patients was 23 (63.9%). There were 15 fatal cases tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (13 cases on HD and 2 cases on PD). By comparing mortality in the same period of 2018, 2019 and 2020, the all-cause mortality of hemodialysis patients was significantly higher in 2020 (4.89%) than in either 2018 (2.55%) or 2019 (1.97%). There was no significant difference in mortality from all causes excluding COVID-19, during the same period among the 3-year period. However, during the COVID-19 outbreak, the mortality from all causes excluding COVID-19 was 2.73%, which was slightly higher than that from COVID-19 (2.16%).

A survey on the opinions of infectious diseases specialists in South Korea,17.0555,12.324926,2020,"BACKGROUND: Fluoroscopic-guided lumbar procedures have increased in daily pain practice since the lumbar spine is one of the most common sources of pain. Interventional pain fellows must develop a minimum number of skills during their training in order to achieve the competences without neglecting radiological safety. However, medical training in fluoroscopic-guided interventions is being affected by the current COVID-19 situation. METHODS: The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of a phantom model for lumbar injection as a training strategy during COVID-19 pandemic in fellows of interventional pain. The study was divided into theoretical and practical modules. The hands-on practice was performed in a lumbar model phantom where fellows were evaluated in four fluoroscopically guided approaches: intraarticular facet block (IAFB), medial branch block (MBB), transforaminal block (TFB) and interlaminar block (ILB) divided in five sessions. The aim was to make as many punctures as possible in every session. We measured total procedural performance (TPP), total needle hand time (TNH) and total radiation dose generated by the fluoroscopic machine (TRD) during each procedure. Additionally, a survey was applied to evaluate confidence and satisfaction before and after training. RESULTS: A total of 320 lumbar punctures were completed. The results were statistically significant in all approaches attempted (p<0.01). Fellow's survey for satisfaction and confidence demonstrated a significant difference between pre and post-test (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study highlight the importance of adaptations and adoption of new educational models. The use of the phantom model for simulation could be a strategy for other emerging situations like the COVID-19 pandemic. Including this practice in the interventional pain programs could lead to better results for the patient and operator radiology safety.","Silva, Victor; Martínez, Luis; Santiago, Margarita; López, Anna; Sánchez, Juan; Vázquez-Garza, Eduardo; Cantu, Fernando; García, Baltazar; Chora, Daniel; Guerra, Miguel; Franco-Cabrera, María",Pain pract.

In this study, we evaluated the analytical and clinical performance of QuickNavi&#8482;-COVID19 Ag, a newly developed antigen test in Japan. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted at a PCR center between October 7 and December 5, 2020. The included patients were referred from a local public health center and 89 primary care facilities. We simultaneously obtained two nasopharyngeal samples with flocked swabs; one was used for the antigen test and the other for real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Using the results of real-time RT-PCR as a reference, the performance of the antigen test was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 1186 patients were included in this study, and the real-time RT-PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 in 105 (8.9%). Of these 105 patients, 33 (31.4%) were asymptomatic. The antigen test provided a 98.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 98.0%-99.4%) concordance rate with real-time RT-PCR, along with a sensitivity of 86.7% (95% CI: 78.6%-92.5%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 99.7%-100%). False-negatives were observed in 14 patients, 8 of whom were asymptomatic and had a low viral load (cycle threshold (Ct) > 30). In symptomatic patients, the sensitivity was 91.7% (95% CI: 82.7%-96.9%). CONCLUSION: QuickNavi&#8482;-COVID19 Ag showed high specificity and sufficient sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.

This was an exploratory qualitative study, which used the theoretical-methodological framework of the Discourse Analysis of French matrix, guided by the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research. The study was conducted in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil. Seven participants were interviewed who were undergoing treatment at the time of the interview. The analysis of the participants' discourses allowed the emergence of four discursive blocks: (1) impact of the social determinants in the development of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, (2) barriers to seeking care and difficulties accessing health services, (3) perceptions of the side effects and their impact on multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment, and (4) tuberculosis and COVID-19: a necessary dialogue. Through discursive formations, these revealed the determinants of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Considering the complexity involved in the dynamics of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, advancing in terms of equity in health, that is, in reducing unjust differences, is a challenge for public policies, especially at the current moment in Brazil, which is of accentuated economic, political and social crisis.

The lack of initial knowledge on its management has led to a great effort in developing vaccines and in finding therapeutic weapons capable of improving the clinical outcome of the affected patients. In particular, the possible role of vitamin D status in the management of COVID-19 has been widely analysed, resulting in a great amount of data. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess whether hypovitaminosis D is a risk factor for developing SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether it affects the worsening of the clinical course of COVID-19. Methods Data were extracted through extensive searches in the Pubmed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, Academic One Files, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases from December 2019 to January 2021, using the keywords: “Vitamin D”, “25 hydroxy Vitamin D”, “25 hydroxycholecalciferol”, “cholecalciferol”, “COVID 19″, “SARS-CoV-2″. We included observational cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies that evaluated differences in serum levels of 25‑hydroxy-cholecalciferol [25(OH)D] in patients who were positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2, in patients with mild or severe forms of COVID-19, and in patients who died or were discharged from the hospital. Finally, studies that evaluated the risk of developing severe illness or death in patients with vitamin D deficiency (VDD), defined as levels of 25(OH)D &lt;20 ng/ml, were also included. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for quantitative variables such as 25(OH)D levels in patients with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection, in those with mild vs. severe COVID-19, or those who have died vs. those who have been discharged. Instead, we calculated odds ratios and 95% CI for qualitative ones, such as the number of patients with severe illness/death in the presence of VDD vs. those with normal serum 25(OH)D levels. A p-value lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021241473). Findings Out of 662 records, 30 articles met inclusion criteria and, therefore, were included in the meta-analysis. We found that the serum levels of 25(OH)D were significantly lower in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection than in negative ones [MD -3.99 (-5.34, -2.64);p &lt;0.00001;I2= 95%]. Furthermore, its levels were significantly lower in patients with severe disease [MD -6.88 (-9.74, -4.03);p &lt;0.00001;I2=98%] and in those who died of COVID-19 [MD -8.01 (-12.50, -3.51);p = 0.0005;I2=86%]. Finally, patients with VDD had an increased risk of developing severe disease [OR 4.58 (2.24, 9.35);p &lt;0.0001;I2=84%] but not a fatal outcome [OR 4.92 (0.83, 29.31);p = 0.08;I2=94%]. Interpretation This meta-analysis revealed a large heterogeneity of the studies included due to the different enrolment criteria of patient samples (age, body mass index, ethnicity, comorbidities), the country where they live, all factors influencing serum 25(OH)D levels, and the different criteria used to define the severity of COVID-19. Furthermore, the observational nature of these studies does not allow to establish a cause-effect relationship, even taking into account that 25(OH)D represents a marker of acute inflammation. Treatment with vitamin D might be considered for the primary prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the management of patients with COVID-19. However, further intervention studies are needed to prove this hypothesis.","Crafa, Andrea Cannarella Rossella Condorelli Rosita A.; Mongioì, Laura M.; Barbagallo, Federica Aversa Antonio La Vignera Sandro Calogero Aldo E.",EClinicalMedicine,347,16

In Germany, where I am located we have meanwhile ended the lockdown phase and started reopening. In this Editorial, I will try to describe the different aspects of the changes for an Orthopaedic Surgeon in this second phase of reopening. As numbers are the main basis for decision-making in this pandemic, I will try to give you a bit of background information on them first. As situations differ depending on the country you live in, you as a reader are probably in a different situation than I am right now, but hopefully you will still get some useful information for your daily routine. Although the numbers have improved a lot, the pandemic is still affecting all aspects of our lives, therefore this editorial is again divided into 4 sections: Role as surgeon, as doctor, as teacher, and as family/society member. As of a few days ago in Germany elective surgeries are allowed to be performed again. Although processes in the OR are very similar to what we have been used to, outside the OR a lot has changed. Testing and patients, maintaining distance, wearing face masks the entire day and so on is heavily affecting our practice. Patients are still nervous to visit the doctor and enter the Hospital although a lot of them are in great pain and have restricted mobility. Even testing all of them is not diffusing the anxiety completely. Objective information by the media, the politicians and us is important to overcome this anxiety. The part of interdisciplinary work became a lot smaller in this phase of reopening. Still pathways and regulations need to be developed but now Orthopaedic work is again the centre of our day in the Hospital. In our role as teacher, we are meanwhile used to all those webinars and digital options of education. However, getting used to it does not mean that we don't miss dearly the additional value of face to face discussions. We have further experienced that building up professional relationships and networks is not only based on facts but also on social factors. Something that we still miss. Reopening has improved life in families a lot. Grandchildren can meet their grandparents again and so on. This positive effect cannot be regarded high enough. Within the society reopening, however, is more demanding than the lockdown was. Protests and conspiracy theories are numerous and it is our mission as educated scientists to inform as many people around us as possible about the facts. Overall, it has to be stated, that all parts of our lives as Orthopaedic Surgeons remain affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Life became better in a lot of ways; however, it is still a long way back to normal and we need to be patient.","Graichen, Heiko",,347,23

The purpose of this study was to assess the implementation of a virtual teaching method using available technology and its role in the continuity of education of practicing radiologists and trainees during the pandemic. METHODS: The authors created the Online Liver Imaging Course (OLIC) that comprised 28 online comprehensive lectures delivered in real-time and on-demand over six weeks. Radiologists and radiology trainees were asked to register to attend the live sessions. At the end of the course, we conducted a 46-question survey among registrants addressing their training level, perception of virtual conferencing, and evaluation of the course content. RESULTS: One thousand four hundred and thirty four radiologists and trainees completed interest sign up forms before the start of the course with the first webinar having the highest number of live attendees (343 people). On average, there were 89 live participants per session and 750 YouTube views per recording (as of July 9, 2020). After the end of the course, 487 attendees from 37 countries responded to the postcourse survey for an overall response rate of (33%). Approximately (63%) of participants were practicing radiologists while (37%) were either fellows or residents and rarely medical students. The overwhelming majority (97%) found the OLIC webinar series to be beneficial. Essentially all attendees felt that the webinar sessions met (43%) or exceeded (57%) their expectations. When asked about their perception of virtual conferences after attending OLIC lectures, almost all attendees (99%) enjoyed the virtual conference with a majority (61%) of the respondents who enjoyed the virtual format more than in-person conferences, while (38%) enjoyed the webinar format but preferred in-person conferences. When asked about the willingness to attend virtual webinars in the future, (84%) said that they would attend future virtual conferences even if in-person conferences resume while (15%) were unsure. CONCLUSION: The success of the OLIC, attributed to many factors, indicates that videoconferencing technology provides an inexpensive alternative to in-person radiology conferences. The positive responses to our postcourse survey suggest that virtual education will remain to stay. Educational institutions and scientific societies should foster such models.","Elsayes, Khaled M; Marks, Robert M; Kamel, Serageldin; Towbin, Alexander J; Kielar, Ania Z; Patel, Parth; Chernyak, Victoria; Fowler, Kathryn J; Nassar, Sameh; Soliman, Moataz A; Kamaya, Aya; Mendiratta-Lala, Mishal; Borhani, Amir A; Fetzer, David T; Fung, Alice W; Do, Richard K G; Bashir, Mustafa R; Lee, James; Consul, Nikita; Olmsted, Richard; Kambadone, Avinash; Taouli, Bachir; Furlan, Alessandro; Sirlin, Claude B; Hsieh, Peggy",Acad. radiol,347,6

Theoretically, asthmatic patients should have increased susceptibility and severity for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to a deficient antiviral immune response and the tendency for exacerbation elicited by common respiratory viruses. However, existing studies have not shown an expected prevalence of asthmatic individuals among COVID-19 patients. Certain aspects of type 2 immune response, including type 2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, etc.) and accumulation of eosinophils, might provide potential protective effects against COVID-19. Furthermore, conventional therapeutics for asthma, including inhaled corticosteroids, allergen immunotherapy (AIT), and anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, might also reduce the risks of asthmatics suffering infection of the virus through alleviating inflammation or enhancing antiviral defense.

PMT postulates both the threat appraisal and the coping appraisal as predictors of health behaviors. Recent advances in the field of behavioral immune system (BIS) research suggest that humans are equipped with a set of psychological adaptations enabling them to detect the disease-threat and activate behavioral avoidance of pathogens. The present study, set within PMT framework and informed by the BIS research, aimed to explain and predict voluntary adherence to COVID-19 guidelines by perceived personal risk and vulnerability to disease as threat appraisal variables, and trust in science as the response efficacy element of coping appraisal. Gender, age, belief in the second wave, perceived personal risk, germ aversion, and trust in science were all found to be significant positive predictors of the intent to adhere to non-pharmacological COVID-19 recommendations, with the belief in the second wave, germ aversion, and trust in science being the most important ones. On the other hand, only the belief in the second wave and trust in science were significant positive predictors of the intent to adhere to pharmacological COVID-19 recommendations (i.e., to vaccinate). Interventions aimed at enhancing preventative measures adherence should take into account that the psychological mechanisms underlying adherence to these two types of recommendations are not identical.","Hromatko, I.; Tonkovic, M.; Vranic, A.",Frontiers in Psychology,347,14

Under this circumstance, remote learning that emphasized learning via online setting embraced in higher education to replace the physical classroom during the pandemic time. This study designed a single Problem-Based Learning (PBL) module using remote learning to examine the students experience in PBL, and to what extent the PBL module helps students to improve their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The remote learning PBL module conducted using reflection method to assess the students' experiences in PBL learning. On the other hand, a set of survey questionnaires was distributed to 34 undergraduate students to gather the responses for the assessment of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This study employed both quantitative and qualitative analysis to investigate the students’ critical thinking, problem-solving skills and their experience in remote learning PBL. Using paired sample t-test to test the difference between pre- and post- remote learning PBL class, results indicated that there was a significant improvement of students’ critical thinking and problem-solving skills after remote learning PBL class. On the other hand, thematic analysis on students’ feedback on remote learning PBL class- first, second, and third meeting, indicated that students gradually improved their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Although students implied positive feedback on the class, however, some of them were facing difficulties in understanding the module or physical disruptions that distract their learning. The findings gave insights for the lecturers to design a suitable learning course during the pandemic time. Moreover, the findings highlighted challenges that gave insights for the lecturers to look at the students’ feedback from time to time to improve the learning mechanisms and to create a better learning environment. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological well-being of staff is already identified as an area of high risk; therefore, providing timely access to psychological support may be vital, although limited evidence is available on how these risks are best managed. AIMS: To describe implementation and analysis of a psychology-led COVID-19 telephone support line in a National Health Service OHS. METHODS: Data from calls made to the support line were collected over the first 4 weeks of service implementation. Numerical data including frequency of calls and average waiting time were first considered. A content analysis was then conducted on call notes to identify prevalence of themes. RESULTS: Six hundred and fifty-five calls were received, and 362 notes included sufficient information for use within the content analysis. Frequency of calls peaked within the first week followed by a reduction in the number of calls received per day over time. Most calls included discussion around clarification of guidance (68%) with a smaller subset of calls offering support around anxiety (29%). Prevalence of themes did not appear to change over time. CONCLUSIONS: Clear and timely information is vital to support the well-being of healthcare staff. A psychologically informed telephone support line was a good use of occupational health service resources in the interim while more tailored advice and services could be established.","Matthewson, J; Tiplady, A; Gerakios, F; Foley, A; Murphy, E",Occup Med (Lond),347,16

L’épidémie dans notre département a sévèrement touché un cluster urbain composé à 90 % d’une population gitane jeune et comorbide avec un taux de prise en charge en réanimation élevé et un faible taux de mortalité (respectivement 34 % contre 25 % et 7,2 % contre 10,2 % en France à cette période). L’objectif de cette étude est d’évaluer si les séquelles à 3 mois dans une telle cohorte sont différentes de celles retrouvées dans la littérature. Matériels et méthodes Étude rétrospective observationnelle monocentrique à partir des données du dossier médical informatisé. Notre centre a organisé le suivi à 3 mois des patients de la première vague guéris d’une COVID grave : évaluation clinicobiologique, tests cognitif (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) et d’anxiété (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), suivi en médecine du sport avec test de marche 6min, scanner pulmonaire, explorations fonctionnelles respiratoires (EFR), ECG et échographie cardiaque (ETT). Résultats Il a été inclus 51 patients (26 femmes), âge moyen 58 ans, 20 (39,2 %) avaient été intubés, 8 avaient eu de la VNI ou de l’optiflow. Les comorbidités les plus fréquentes étaient l’obésité (IMC&gt;30kg/m2) 33/51 (64,9 %), le diabète 22/51 (43,1 %) et l’HTA 22/51 (43,1 %). Au moins 1 symptôme persistait pour 92 % (47/51) des patients: asthénie 74,5 % (38/51), dyspnée 66 % (34/51), prise de poids 39,2 % (20/51). Un état d’anxiété était relevé pour près de 51 % des patients (26/51). La sérologie covid19 était positive pour 92 % des patients (46/50). Le suivi par scanner montrait la persistance d’anomalies pour 33/51 patients (64,7 %) dont 45,4 % d’images en verre dépoli (15/33) et 21,2 % (7/33) d’images de fibrose pulmonaire. Des EFR ont été réalisées pour 48 patients avec mesure de DLCO pour 41 d’entre eux. On retrouvait 10 (20,8 %) syndromes restrictifs (tous avaient des anomalies au scanner) et 19 (46,3 %) troubles de la diffusion du CO2 (dont 13/19 avec anomalies au scanner et 13/19 avec dyspnée). Le périmètre de marche moyen est de 405m (55–675m) soit 62 % de la distance théorique, avec 11,1 % (5) de désaturation&lt;94 %. Tous ont eu un ECG. Des anomalies ont été retrouvées chez 17 patients (10 troubles de la conduction non graves, 7 troubles de la repolarisation). L’ETT réalisée pour 34 patients montrait 4 (11,8 %) dysfonctions ventriculaires (FEVG&lt;50 %), 6 signes de coronaropathie. Conclusion En comparaison avec la littérature, notre cohorte est définie par des patients avec un IMC plus élevé, une forte prévalence de diabète, un fort taux de COVID critiques. Le taux d’anxiété et de symptômes persistants est plus élevé. La prévalence des anomalies au scanner et du FEVG est similaire. Pour les EFR, les données de la littérature sont variables. Le périmètre de marche de notre cohorte est plus faible. Ces résultats suggèrent une similarité des données objectives avec celles du reste de la population générale mais une augmentation des symptômes subjectifs qui peut être liée à des facteurs confondants tels que l’obésité, les habitudes sédentaires de la population étudiée. Une prise en charge post COVID spécifique semble donc pertinente pour limiter l’impact des séquelles dans cette population.","Granger, C.; Hlal, O.; Mercier, E.; Bordart, E.; Teule, L.; Colombain, L.; Aumaître, H.",Infectious Diseases Now,347,1

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among college students in different geographical areas of China during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted among Chinese college students of 16 provinces or municipalities from February 4 to 12, 2020. A web-based survey was adopted to collect information from these college students, including demographics, perceived risk of infection, attitudes toward the epidemic and its control, and mental health status. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire. Chi-square test was used to compare the percentage of perceived risk of infection and attitude toward COVID-19 among college students in different geographic locations. Binary logistic models were used to identify associations between geographic locations and mental health problems after controlling for covariates. RESULTS: A total of 11,787 participants were analyzed in this study (response rate: 79.7%). The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among college students was 17.8% (95% CI 17.1%-18.5%) and 25.9% (95% CI 25.1%-26.7%), respectively. After controlling for covariates, current residence area in Wuhan city was found to have a positive association with anxiety symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 1.37, 95% CI 1.11-1.68) and depressive symptoms (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09-1.59). Similarly, college location in Wuhan city was found to have a positive association with anxiety symptoms (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07-1.35) and depressive symptoms (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.10-1.36). History of residence in or travel to Wuhan city in the past month was also positively associated with anxiety symptoms (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.46-1.80) and depressive symptoms (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.35-1.63). Furthermore, the perceived risk of COVID-19 was higher among students whose college location and current residence area were in Wuhan city, and it was positively associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health problems among Chinese college students were widespread and geographically diverse. Our study results provide further insight for policymakers to develop targeted intervention strategies.","Wu, Xiaoyan; Tao, Shuman; Zhang, Yi; Li, Shiyue; Ma, Le; Yu, Yizhen; Sun, Guilong; Li, Tingting; Tao, Fangbiao",J Med Internet Res,347,21

Spike protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 mediates viral entry into host cells by binding ACE2 through the receptor‐binding domain (RBD). RBD is an important target for development of virus inhibitors, neutralizing antibodies, and vaccines. RBD expressed in mammalian cells suffers from low expression yield and high cost. &lt;italic&gt;E. coli&lt;/italic&gt; is a popular host for protein expression, which has the advantage of easy scalability with low cost. However, RBD expressed by &lt;italic&gt;E. coli&lt;/italic&gt; (RBD‐1) lacks the glycosylation, and its antigenic epitopes may not be sufficiently exposed. In the present study, RBD‐1 was expressed by &lt;italic&gt;E. coli&lt;/italic&gt; and purified by a Ni Sepharose Fast Flow column. RBD‐1 was structurally characterized and compared with RBD expressed by the HEK293 cells (RBD‐2). The secondary structure and tertiary structure of RBD‐1 were largely maintained without glycosylation. In particular, the major β‐sheet content of RBD‐1 was almost unaltered. RBD‐1 could strongly bind ACE2 with a dissociation constant (KD) of 2.98 × 10–8 M. Thus, RBD‐1 was expected to apply in the vaccine development, screening drugs and virus test kit.

METHODS: Two systematic literature reviews determined the frequency of clinical features of GCA and COVID-19 in published reports. Frequencies in each disease were summarised using median and range. RESULTS: Headache was common in GCA but was also observed in COVID-19 (66% for GCA, 10% for COVID-19). Jaw claudication or visual loss (43% and 26% in GCA, respectively) were not reported in COVID-19. Both diseases featured fatigue (38% for GCA, 43% for COVID-19) and elevated inflammatory markers (CRP elevated in 100% of GCA, 66% of COVID-19), but platelet count was elevated in 47% of GCA but 4% of COVID-19. Cough and fever were commonly reported in COVID-19 and less frequently in GCA (cough, 63% for COVID-19 versus 12% for GCA; fever, 83% for COVID-19 versus 27% for GCA). Gastrointestinal upset was occasionally reported in COVID-19 (8%), rarely in GCA (4%). Lymphopenia was more common in COVID-19 than GCA (53% in COVID-19, 2% in GCA). Alteration of smell and taste been described in GCA but their frequency is unclear. CONCLUSION: Overlapping features of GCA and COVID-19 include headache, fever, elevated CRP and cough. Jaw claudication, visual loss, platelet count and lymphocyte count may be more discriminatory. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of diagnostic confusion. We have designed a simple checklist to aid evidence-based evaluation of patients with suspected GCA.","Mehta, Puja; Sattui, Sebastian E; van der Geest, Kornelis; Brouwer, Elisabeth; Conway, Richard; Putman, Michael S; Robinson, Philip C; Mackie, Sarah L",J. rheumatol,347,20

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed and Embase till April 15, 2020, by combining the terms (COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, Novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCov, Wuhan pneumonia) and (pregnancy, pregnant women, mother, fetus, neonate, newborn, infant). RESULTS: We included 16 case series and 12 case reports describing a total of 223 pregnant women and 201 infants. Four newborns born to mothers affected by COVID-19 were reported to have laboratory-confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection within 48 hours after birth. However, Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction tests of the breast milk, placenta, amniotic fluids, and cord blood and maternal vaginal secretions were all negative for SARS-CoV-2 in the reported cases. Fetal death was reported in two cases, and 48 of 185 newborns (25.9%) were born prematurely. Infants born small for gestational age and low birth weight (< 2,500 g) accounted for 8.3% and 15.6% of reported cases, respectively. Birth asphyxia and respiratory distress syndrome were observed in 1.8% and 6.4% of neonates, respectively. There was one neonatal death due to intractable gastric bleeding among the SARS-CoV-2-negative infants. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests that COVID-19 during pregnancy rarely affects fetal and neonatal mortality, but can be associated with adverse neonatal morbidities. Vertical transmission has not been observed in the majority of the reported cases. The infants born to mothers with COVID-19 are carefully monitored for accompanying complication, and quarantine of infected mothers is warranted.","Yoon, S H; Kang, J-M; Ahn, J G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,347,15

Since hypertension is a leading comorbidity in non-survivors of COVID-19, we tested for association between ACE2 gene and hypertension in interaction with specific pre-existing conditions known to be associated with COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Genetic analysis of ACE2 gene was conducted in French-Canadian and British populations. RESULTS: In French-Canadian individuals, the T allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2074192 of ACE2 gene was a risk factor for hypertension in adult obese males [odds ratio (OR)=1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.83)] and even more so in obese males who smoked (OR=1.67, CI: 1.24-2.55), but not in lean males, non-smoker males or females. The T allele was significantly associated with severity of hypertension and with earlier penetrance of hypertension in obese smoking males. Significant interaction between the T allele and obesity was present in both sexes. The association of ACE2 (rs233575) genotype with blood pressure was also seen in adolescents but the interaction with obesity was present only in females. Several variants in ACE2 gene were found to be associated with hypertension in obese, smoking males in British individuals of the UK Biobank. In addition, we observed more severe outcomes to COVID-19 in association with ACE2 risk alleles in obese, smoking males. CONCLUSION: This is the first report that ACE2 variants are associated with earlier penetrance and more severe hypertension and with more severe outcomes of COVID-19 in obese smoking males.","Hamet, Pavel; Pausova, Zdenka; Attaoua, Redha; Hishmih, Camil; Haloui, Mounsif; Shin, Jean; Paus, Tomas; Abrhamowicz, Michal; Gaudet, Daniel; Santucci, Lara; Kotchen, Theodore A; Cowley, Allen W; Hussin, Julie; Tremblay, Johanne",Am. j. hypertens,347,13

This study aimed to investigate people's psychological and behavioural responses to the COVID-19 epidemic and explore the predictors for social distancing and panic buying. Methods: A 17-item questionnaire was developed and distributed randomly to people using social media. Descriptive statistics and one-way ANOVA were used to assess people's psychological and behavioural responses. Hierarchical regression was conducted to investigate the predictive effects of psychological and behavioural variables on reports of social distancing and panic buying respectively. Results: Respondents reported a low degree of risk perception and risk beliefs with regard to being outside, and had moderate psychological stress and positive safeguarding behaviours for being outside. Respondents reported high concern regarding COVID-19 and tended to keep social distancing during the epidemic. They would panic-purchase food and supplies. In addition, psychological stress emerged as a very strong predictor for reporting COVID-19 concerns and panic buying. Furthermore, reported concerns about COVID-19 information sharing had a significant predictive influence on panic buying of food. Safeguarding behaviours for being outside had a significant predictive effect on respondents reported social distancing of cancelling outings. Reported concerns about COVID-19 were stronger predictors for reported social distancing. Conclusion: It is important to relieve people's psychological stress and manage information sharing to control panic buying. In addition, we should promote adoption of safeguarding behaviours for being outside and emphasise the concerns with regard to COVID-19 to encourage people keep social distancing. Measures should be implemented according to the characteristics of the population.","Zhang, Yaping; Zhou, Ronggang",Z Gesundh Wiss,347,1

We utilize physics-based modeling at different levels of complexity, and literature on coronaviruses, to investigate the possibility of airborne transmission. The previous literature, our 0D-3D simulations by various physics-based models, and theoretical calculations, indicate that the typical size range of speech and cough originated droplets (d<20microns) allows lingering in the air for O(1h) so that they could be inhaled. Consistent with the previous literature, numerical evidence on the rapid drying process of even large droplets, up to sizes O(100microns), into droplet nuclei/aerosols is provided. Based on the literature and the public media sources, we provide evidence that the infected individuals could have been exposed to aerosols/droplet nuclei by inhaling them in significant numbers e.g. O(100). By 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, we give examples on the transport and dilution of aerosols (d<20microns) over distances O(10m) in generic environments. We study susceptible and infected individuals in generic public places by Monte-Carlo modeling. The model accounts for the locally varying aerosol concentration levels which the susceptible accumulate via inhalation. The introduced concept, 'exposure time' to virus containing aerosols is proposed to complement the traditional 'safety distance' thinking. We show that the exposure time to inhale O(100) aerosols could range from O(1s) to O(1min) or even to O(1h) depending on the situation. The Monte Carlo analysis provides clear quantitative insight to the exposure time in different public indoor environments.","Vuorinen, Ville; Aarnio, Mia; Alava, Mikko; Alopaeus, Ville; Atanasova, Nina; Auvinen, Mikko; Balasubramanian, Nallannan; Bordbar, Hadi; Erasto, Panu; Grande, Rafael; Hayward, Nick; Hellsten, Antti; Hostikka, Simo; Hokkanen, Jyrki; Kaario, Ossi; Karvinen, Aku; Kivisto, Ilkka; Korhonen, Marko; Kosonen, Risto; Kuusela, Janne; Lestinen, Sami; Laurila, Erkki; Nieminen, Heikki; Peltonen, Petteri; Pokki, Juho; Puisto, Antti; Raaback, Peter; Salmenjoki, Henri; Sironen, Tarja; Osterberg, Monika",,347,30

We focus on two federally regulated pollutants, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Observed concentrations at all available ground monitoring sites (240 and 480 for NO2 and PM2.5, respectively) were compared between April 2020 and April of the prior five years, 2015-2019, as the baseline. Large statistically significant decreases in NO2 concentrations were found at more than 65% of the monitoring sites, with an average drop of 2 ppb when compared to the mean of the previous five years. The same patterns are confirmed by satellite-derived NO2 column totals from NASA OMI. PM2.5 concentrations from the ground monitoring sites, however, were more likely to be higher. The second goal of this study is to explain the different responses of the two pollutants during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hypothesis put forward is that the shelter-in-place measures affected peoples' driving patterns most dramatically, thus passenger vehicle NO2 emissions were reduced. Commercial vehicles and electricity demand for all purposes remained relatively unchanged, thus PM2.5 concentrations did not drop significantly. To establish a correlation between the observed NO2 changes and the extent to which people were sheltering in place, we use a mobility index, which was produced and made public by Descartes Labs. This mobility index aggregates cell phone usage at the county level to capture changes in human movement over time. We found a strong correlation between the observed decreases in NO2 concentrations and decreases in human mobility. By contrast, no discernible pattern was detected between mobility and PM2.5 concentrations changes, suggesting that decreases in personal-vehicle traffic alone may not be effective at reducing PM2.5 pollution.","Archer, Cristina L.; Cervone, Guido; Golbazi, Maryam; Fahel, Nicolas Al; Hultquist, Carolynne",,347,16

Recent findings suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus pathogen that causes COVID-19, could elicit a cytokine storm that drives edema, dysfunction of the airway exchange, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in the lung, followed by acute cardiac injury and thromboembolic events leading to multiorgan failure and death. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), owing to their powerful immunomodulatory abilities, have the potential to attenuate the cytokine storm and have therefore been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for which several clinical trials are underway. Given that intravenous infusion of MSCs results in a significant trapping in the lung, MSC therapy could directly mitigate inflammation, protect alveolar epithelial cells, and reverse lung dysfunction by normalizing the pulmonary microenvironment and preventing pulmonary fibrosis.

IL­6 works through an interaction with the complex peptide IL­6 receptor (IL­6R). IL­6 is built with four &#945;­chain nanostructures, while two different chains, IL­6R&#945; (gp80) and gp130/IL6ß (gp130), are included in IL­6R. The three­dimensional shapes of the six chains composing the IL­6/IL­6R complex are the basis for the nanomolecular roles of IL­6 signalling. Genes, pseudogenes and competitive endogenous RNAs of IL­6 have been identified. In the present review, the roles played by miRNA in the post­transcriptional regulation of IL­6 expression are evaluated. mRNAs are absorbed via the 'sponge' effect to dynamically balance mRNA levels and this has been assessed with regard to IL­6 transcription efficiency. According to current knowledge on molecular and nanomolecular structures involved in active IL­6 signalling, two different IL­6 models have been proposed. IL­6 mainly has functions in inflammatory processes, as well as in cognitive activities. Furthermore, the abnormal production of IL­6 has been found in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS­CoV­2; also known as COVID­19). In the present review, both inflammatory and cognitive IL­6 models were analysed by evaluating the cytological and histological locations of IL­6 signalling. The goal of this review was to illustrate the roles of the classic and trans­signalling IL­6 pathways in endocrine glands such as the thyroid and in the central nervous system. Specifically, autoimmune thyroid diseases, disorders of cognitive processes and SARS­CoV­2 virus infection have been examined to determine the contribution of IL­6 to these disease states.","Trovato, Maria; Sciacchitano, Salvatore; Facciolà, Alessio; Valenti, Andrea; Visalli, Giuseppa; Di Pietro, Angela",Int. j. mol. med,347,16

The concentration resulting in 50% inhibition (IC50 ; 2 µM) was > 35× higher than the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ) after oral administration of the approved dose of ivermectin when given fasted. Simulations were conducted using an available population pharmacokinetic model to predict total (bound and unbound) and unbound plasma concentration-time profiles after a single and repeat fasted administration of the approved dose of ivermectin (200 µg/kg), 60 mg, and 120 mg. Plasma total Cmax was determined and then multiplied by the lung:plasma ratio reported in cattle to predict the lung Cmax after administration of each single dose. Plasma ivermectin concentrations of total (bound and unbound) and unbound concentrations do not reach the IC50 , even for a dose level 10× higher than the approved dose. Even with the high lung:plasma ratio, ivermectin is unlikely to reach the IC50 in the lungs after single oral administration of the approved dose (predicted lung: 0.0873 µM) or at doses 10× higher that the approved dose administered orally (predicted lung: 0.820 µM).

It appears that development of 'cytokine storm' in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia precipitates progression to ARDS. However, severity scores on admission do not predict severity or mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Our objective was to determine whether patients with SARS-CoV-2 ARDS are clinically distinct, therefore requiring alternative management strategies, compared with other patients with ARDS. We report a single-centre retrospective study comparing the characteristics and outcomes of patients with ARDS with and without SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Two intensive care unit (ICU) cohorts of patients at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham were analysed: SARS-CoV-2 patients admitted between 11 March and 21 April 2020 and all patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) from bacterial or viral infection who developed ARDS between 1 January 2017 and 1 November 2019. All data were routinely collected on the hospital's electronic patient records. RESULTS: A greater proportion of SARS-CoV-2 patients were from an Asian ethnic group (p=0.002). SARS-CoV-2 patients had lower circulating leucocytes, neutrophils and monocytes (p<0.0001), but higher CRP (p=0.016) on ICU admission. SARS-CoV-2 patients required a longer duration of mechanical ventilation (p=0.01), but had lower vasopressor requirements (p=0.016). DISCUSSION: The clinical syndromes and respiratory mechanics of SARS-CoV-2 and CAP-ARDS are broadly similar. However, SARS-CoV-2 patients initially have a lower requirement for vasopressor support, fewer circulating leukocytes and require prolonged ventilation support. Further studies are required to determine whether the dysregulated inflammation observed in SARS-CoV-2 ARDS may contribute to the increased duration of respiratory failure.","Mahida, Rahul Y; Chotalia, Minesh; Alderman, Joseph; Patel, Chhaya; Hayden, Amber; Desai, Ruchi; Beesley, Emily; Crowley, Louise E; Soltan, Marina; Bangash, Mansoor; Parekh, Dhruv; Patel, Jaimin; Thickett, David R",,347,16

While recent commentaries provide useful policy recommendations, few studies examine the intersection of COVID-19 policy responses and patterns of opioid overdose. We examine opioid overdoses prior to and following the Pennsylvania stay-at-home order implemented on April 1, 2020. Using data from the Pennsylvania Overdose Information Network, we measure change in monthly incidents of opioid-related overdose pre- versus post-April 1, and the significance of change by gender, age, race, drug class, and naloxone doses administered. Findings demonstrate statistically significant increases in overdose incidents among both men and women, White and Black groups, and several age groups, most notably the 30–39 and 40–49 ranges, following April 1. Significant increases were observed for overdoses involving heroin, fentanyl, fentanyl analogs or other synthetic opioids, pharmaceutical opioids, and carfentanil. The study emphasizes the need for opioid use to be addressed alongside efforts to mitigate and manage COVID-19 infection.

We investigated the clinical and chest computed tomography characteristics of patients with COVID-19 at the peak of the epidemic from multiple centres in China. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of 189 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to seven hospitals in four Chinese provinces from 18 January 2020 to 3 February 2020. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 44 years and 52.9% were men; 186/189 had &#8805;1 co-existing medical condition. Fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, diarrhoea, and headache were common symptoms at onset; hypertension was the most common co-morbidity. Common clinical signs included dyspnoea, hypoxia, leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, and neutropenia; most lesions exhibited subpleural distribution. The most common radiological manifestation was mixed ground-glass opacity with consolidation (mGGO-C); most patients had grid-like shadows and some showed paving stones. Patients with hypertension, dyspnoea, or hypoxia exhibited more severe lobe involvement and diffusely distributed lesions. Patients in severely affected areas exhibited higher body temperature; more fatigue and dyspnoea; and more manifestations of multiple lesions, lobe involvement, and mGGO-C. During the Wuhan lockdown period, cough, nausea, and dyspnoea were alleviated in patients with newly confirmed COVID-19; lobe involvement was also improved. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with COVID-19 hospitalised at the peak of the epidemic in China, fever, cough, and dyspnoea were the main symptoms at initial diagnosis, accompanied by lymphocytopenia and hypoxaemia. Patients with severe disease showed more severe lobe involvement and diffuse pulmonary lesion distribution.","Wang, Y; Luo, S; Zhou, C S; Wen, Z Q; Chen, W; Liao, W H; Liu, J; Yang, Y; Shi, J C; Liu, S D; Xia, F; Yan, Z H; Lu, X; Chen, T; Yan, F; Zhang, B; Zhang, D Y; Sun, Z Y",Hong Kong med. j,347,24

More than 4 million cases of COVID-19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been confirmed as of 11 May 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic and transmissible coronavirus that primarily spreads through respiratory droplets and close contact. A growing body of clinical data suggests that a cytokine storm is associated with COVID-19 severity and is also a crucial cause of death from COVID-19. In the absence of antivirals and vaccines for COVID-19, there is an urgent need to understand the cytokine storm in COVID-19. Here, we have reviewed the current understanding of the features of SARS-CoV-2 and the pathological features, pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatments of the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19. In addition, we suggest that the identification and treatment of the cytokine storm are important components for rescuing patients with severe COVID-19.","Hu, Biying; Huang, Shaoying; Yin, Lianghong",J. med. virol,347,16

As one of the most populous countries in the world, China has the largest number of households in the world but quite a low home game penetration rate due to the 13 year game industry winter for international enterprises. Whether Chinese customers have the intention of using motion-sensing games to improve their health status in the home environment will directly determine the commercial potential of the relevant industry in the Chinese market. In order to understand the motives of users and explore the market possibility and prospects of the game industry, this study adopts empirical research and structural equation modeling to construct a motivation model of Chinese consumers toward motion-sensing gameplay behavior in the household environment. We distributed 515 questionnaires to conduct a survey; 427 valid responses have been received, and 203 data, which meet the inclusion criteria of the required game experience, have been analyzed by SPSS25.0 and AMOS25.0. A structural equation model for the gameplay motivation has been constructed. The result shows that the three functional motivators, exercise (Path efficient = 0.40, p < 0.01), entertainment (Path efficient = 0.27, p < 0.01), and social interaction (Path efficient = 0.36, p < 0.01) of home motion-sensing games have a significantly positive impact on the user's intention to play. Furthermore, the diversity and the time-and-place flexibility variables exert an important positive influence on the users' gameplay behavior through their effects on the three main functional motive variables. To sum up, (1) exercise, (2) entertainment, and (3) social interaction are the main functional motivations of the Chinese consumers' gameplay behaviors; (4) diversity and (5) time-and-place flexibility are the two main attribute motivators. The acceptance of Chinese users for home motion-sensing games remains positive and high. The motion-sensing game industry has broad market prospects in China through its potential in promoting consumer's wellness and health in the home environment.","Liu, Yuqi; Song, Yao; Tamura, Ryoichi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),347,32

These include the Pfizer and Moderna first mRNA vaccines under FDA purview and the Oxford/AstraZeneca simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine (under UK-MHPRA guidance), all produced in record time, being safe and effective. The Pfizer and Moderna double dose vaccines have the clear edge in treatment efficacy, being in the 90% range compared to AstraZeneca in the average 70%. However, the AZ double dose vaccine has significant advantages with respect to lower cost and stability in storage. We enumerate several potential advances in the technology of the manufacturers: (1) combination vaccines such as testing AstraZeneca's product with a component of the Russian's Sputnik V to achieve durable immunity; (2) the potential for single dose vaccines coming on-line, and with Johnson & Johnson/Janssen; and (3) the need for refined thermotolerant formulations obviating the need for cold storage. As an adjunct to vaccinotherapy, affinity adsorption column technology is another facet recruited in the processing of corona convalescent plasma/cryosupernatant to concentrate neutralizing antibodies against the virus. Clinical trials, to date, of infected patients have been indeterminate as to whether plasmapheresis-based products are effective or not. This is due to the failure to standardize the composition of the plasma derived component, ambiguous clinical indications for use in human subjects, and inconsistent timing of administration in the course of the infection.

Indeed, those who have legalized the drug have previously approved its therapeutic use. This 'justifying a project phase' stage seems unavoidable. Therefore, it is appropriate to recall the effects and misdeeds of the drug during its recreational use. The general population surveys carried out in France for 25 years by public health France and the French Observatory of Drugs and Drug Addiction, have followed the evolution of psychoactive substances consumption. Particular attention was focused on cannabis use, which, in a context of wide dissemination for a quarter of a century, rose steadily higher among younger generations, but also among older adults. France is the European country with the highest prevalence of cannabis use among young people and adults. Last 25 years, its diffusion has continued to expand, and the experimentation rate multiplied by near 4. Estimated at 12.7% in 1992, it reached 44.8% in 2017. Moreover, 25% of users in the year aged from 18 to 64 years old were at high risk of problematic use or dependence in 2017.

New students were welcomed on campus and included international students and international faculty members. It was business as usual, a beautiful and colorful fall semester that transitioned into a cold winter season. Spring arrived after a long winter season and it was off to a good start as well until the pandemic hit. This paper reflects on how an institution with multiple sites responded to the pandemic and what the impact of those disruptions were on the core activities of a university. As a university with the largest number of international students and a footprint on every continent, the university had to coordinate its activities around the world to complete the academic year and start another one. The university is the largest private employer in the city with over 50,000 students and more than 19,000 employees. The main focus of this reflection paper is the New York city campus where the author is based and key areas of this reflections include the impact of the pandemic on international students, teaching, research and funding related issues. Activities were normalized through central command instructions and guidance that were sometimes helpful and at other times overwhelming, but the work continued and the academic year was completed. The new academic year started with minor variations on the start dates. For example, the portal campuses at Abu Dhabi started on Sunday 6th September and New York city campus started on Wednesday 2nd September, whilst the Shanghai campus started on Monday the 14th.

(Special Issue: Adverse cutaneous reactions to medications.),17.00696,12.038427,2020,"OBJECTIVES: There is little known about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on patients with inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (iRMD). We examined epidemiological characteristics associated with severe disease, then with death. We also compared mortality between patients hospitalised for COVID-19 with and without iRMD. METHODS: Individuals with suspected iRMD-COVID-19 were included in this French cohort. Logistic regression models adjusted for age and sex were used to estimate adjusted ORs and 95% CIs of severe COVID-19. The most significant clinically relevant factors were analysed by multivariable penalised logistic regression models, using a forward selection method. The death rate of hospitalised patients with iRMD-COVID-19 (moderate-severe) was compared with a subset of patients with non-iRMD-COVID-19 from a French hospital matched for age, sex, and comorbidities. RESULTS: Of 694 adults, 438 (63%) developed mild (not hospitalised), 169 (24%) moderate (hospitalised out of the intensive care unit (ICU) and 87 (13%) severe (patients in ICU/deceased) disease. In multivariable imputed analyses, the variables associated with severe infection were age (OR=1.08, 95% CI: 1.05-1.10), female gender (OR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.25-0.80), body mass index (OR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.02-1.12), hypertension (OR=1.86, 95% CI: 1.01-3.42), and use of corticosteroids (OR=1.97, 95% CI: 1.09-3.54), mycophenolate mofetil (OR=6.6, 95% CI: 1.47-29.62) and rituximab (OR=4.21, 95% CI: 1.61-10.98). Fifty-eight patients died (8% (total) and 23% (hospitalised)). Compared with 175 matched hospitalised patients with non-iRMD-COVID-19, the OR of mortality associated with hospitalised patients with iRMD-COVID-19 was 1.45 (95% CI: 0.87-2.42) (n=175 each group). CONCLUSIONS: In the French RMD COVID-19 cohort, as already identified in the general population, older age, male gender, obesity, and hypertension were found to be associated with severe COVID-19. Patients with iRMD on corticosteroids, but not methotrexate, or tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 inhibitors, should be considered as more likely to develop severe COVID-19. Unlike common comorbidities such as obesity, and cardiovascular or lung diseases, the risk of death is not significantly increased in patients with iRMD.

This study examined early impact of COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity in adults during the first two months of restrictions in the U.S. and how physical activity locations were associated with physical activity levels during this period. Adults (N = 268) completed an online survey between April 10-May 25, 2020. Participants reported minutes of vigorous, moderate, and walking physical activity for past 7 days (early-COVID-19) and for a typical week in February 2020 (pre-COVID-19). Adults reported locations (e.g., home/garage, parks/trails) were they were active over the past 7 days. Past 12-month step count data were extracted from participants' personal smartphones. Participants (18-74 years old, 22% Hispanic/Latino, 81% female) showed reductions in vigorous (M diff = -66.9 min/week), moderate (M diff = -92.4 min/week), walking (M diff -70.8 min/week), and step counts (M diff = -2232 steps/day) from the pre- to early-COVID19 periods. Reductions in walking and steps were larger for low-income and Hispanic/Latino adults. During early-COVID19, more vigorous and moderate activity were reported by those who were active in their home/garage or driveway/yard, and more steps were recorded by those who were active on the roads in their neighborhood or at parks/trails. We observed a decline in adults' physical activity during the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic based on retrospective self-report and device-based measures. Although these restrictions were necessary to slow the spread of the virus, data indicate that there may be unintended consequences on health-related behaviors.","Dunton, Genevieve F; Wang, Shirlene D; Do, Bridgette; Courtney, Jimikaye",Prev Med Rep,347,10

A concomitant of sedentariness is compromised mental health. We investigated the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on PA, sedentary behavior, and mental health across four Western nations (USA, UK, France, and Australia). METHODS: An online survey was administered in the second quarter of 2020 (N = 2541). We measured planned and unplanned dimensions of PA using the Brunel Lifestyle Physical Activity Questionnaire and mental health using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. Steps per day were recorded only from participants who used an electronic device for this purpose, and sedentary behavior was reported in hours per day (sitting and screen time). RESULTS: In the USA and Australia samples, there was a significant decline in planned PA from pre- to during lockdown. Among young adults, Australians exhibited the lowest planned PA scores, while in middle-aged groups, the UK recorded the highest. Young adults exhibited the largest reduction in unplanned PA. Across nations, there was a reduction of ~ 2000 steps per day. Large increases in sedentary behavior emerged during lockdown, which were most acute in young adults. Lockdown was associated with a decline in mental health that was more pronounced in women. CONCLUSIONS: The findings illustrate the deleterious effects of lockdown on PA, sedentary behavior, and mental health across four Western nations. Australian young and lower middle-aged adults appeared to fare particularly badly in terms of planned PA. The reduction in steps per day is equivalent to the non-expenditure of ~ 100 kcal. Declines in mental health show how harmful lockdowns can be for women in particular.","Karageorghis, Costas I; Bird, Jonathan M; Hutchinson, Jasmin C; Hamer, Mark; Delevoye-Turrell, Yvonne N; Guérin, Ségolène M R; Mullin, Elizabeth M; Mellano, Kathleen T; Parsons-Smith, Renée L; Terry, Victoria R; Terry, Peter C",BMC Public Health,347,12

As the final paper of this Series, we discuss how the medical research community has responded to COVID-19. We recognise the incredible pressure that this pandemic has put on researchers, regulators, and policy makers, all of whom were doing their best to move quickly but safely in a time of tremendous uncertainty. However, the research community's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has prominently highlighted many fundamental issues that exist in clinical trial research under the current system and its incentive structures. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only re-emphasised the importance of well designed randomised clinical trials but also highlighted the need for large-scale clinical trials structured according to a master protocol in a coordinated and collaborative manner. There is also a need for structures and incentives to enable faster data sharing of anonymised datasets, and a need to provide similar opportunities to those in high-income countries for clinical trial research in low-resource regions where clinical trial research receives considerably less research funding.","Park, Jay J H; Mogg, Robin; Smith, Gerald E; Nakimuli-Mpungu, Etheldreda; Jehan, Fyezah; Rayner, Craig R; Condo, Jeanine; Decloedt, Eric H; Nachega, Jean B; Reis, Gilmar; Mills, Edward J",Lancet Glob Health,347,21

METHODS: The evaluations in this retrospective cross-sectional study are based on the IMS RPM® (Regional Pharmaceutical Market) Weekly database, which shows the weekly purchases of public pharmacies from fully-stocked wholesalers at the time the pharmacy purchase is made in Germany. The outcome of this investigation was the development in psychotropic, neurological, and cardiovascular drug purchases by packing unit between Calendar Weeks 6 and 16. RESULTS: In analyses, performed for psychotropic and neurological drugs, compared to Week 11, the largest increases in Week 12 were for anti-Parkinson drugs and tranquilizers (both 24%), followed by antiepileptics (23%). Purchases of antidementive drugs increased by 16% between Week 11 and Week 12. The increase was 43% for vitamin k antagonists, 39% for ACE inhibitors, and 37% for betablockers. CONCLUSION: The results of this retrospective cross-sectional study suggest that the Covid-19 lockdown in Germany was associated with a significant surge in purchasing behavior in pharmacies for different markets including psychotropic, neurological, and cardiovascular drugs.

Senegal, in particular, has been noted for its relative success in mitigating the spread and impact of COVID-19. We report original research findings on COVID-19 beliefs and prevention behaviors in a sample of Senegalese adults. MethodsA multi-modal cross-sectional study was conducted to describe COVID-19 beliefs and prevention behaviors in a sample of Senegalese adults and to identify potential predictors of prevention behaviors. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistics were generated to describe the sample and explore potential correlations. ResultsMask wearing, hand washing, and use of hand sanitizer were most frequently reported. Social distancing and staying at home were also reported albeit to a lower degree. We also identified a range of psychosocial and demographic predictors for COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Men, compared to women, had lower odds (OR=0.59) of reporting prevention behaviors. Rural residents (vs. urban; OR=1.49) and participants with at least a high school education (vs. less than high school education; OR=1.33) were more likely to report COVID-19 prevention behaviors. DiscussionStakeholders and decision makers in Senegal and across Africa can use place-based evidence like ours to address COVID-19 risk factors and intervene effectively with policies and programming. Use of both phone and online surveys enhances representation and study generalizability and should be considered in future research with hard-to-reach populations. Article SummaryO_ST_ABSStrengths and limitations of this studyC_ST_ABSO_LIThe main strength of our study is the use of a multi-modal data collection strategy, online and via telephone. Had we relied on a single method, our samples demographic characteristics would likely have differed while also introducing selection bias. C_LIO_LIOur recruitment strategy may have also increased the potential for selection bias because participants were recruited online and on-the-ground in Senegal; thus, all participants, by the nature of the recruitment methods, had access to the internet and/or a cell phone. To address potential confounding between recruitment methods, we controlled for recruitment method in our multivariate regression modelling. C_LIO_LIPrior to our study, little evidence was available about how populations in francophone West Africa have responded to COVID-19 in their daily lives. We adapted pre-existing research panels and developed novel data collection instruments to capture information about COVID-19, and this may serve as a model for the responsiveness of ongoing scholarship to future global events. C_LIO_LIA study with a larger sample may have been able to identify relationships between knowledge and behaviors, and our study was not design with enough statistical power to detect significant differences. C_LIO_LIThe findings of our study may not be generalizable beyond Senegal, or more specifically Senegalese adults.

However, characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with stroke are not well known. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of risk factors, stroke characteristics, and short-term outcomes in a large health system in New York City. We included consecutively admitted patients with acute cerebrovascular events from March 1, 2020 through April 30, 2020. Data were stratified by COVID-19 status, and demographic variables, medical comorbidities, stroke characteristics, imaging results, and in-hospital outcomes were examined. Among COVID-19-positive patients, we also summarized laboratory test results. RESULTS: Of 277 patients with stroke, 105 (38.0%) were COVID-19-positive. Compared with COVID-19-negative patients, COVID-19-positive patients were more likely to have a cryptogenic (51.8% versus 22.3%, P<0.0001) stroke cause and were more likely to suffer ischemic stroke in the temporal (P=0.02), parietal (P=0.002), occipital (P=0.002), and cerebellar (P=0.028) regions. In COVID-19-positive patients, mean coagulation markers were slightly elevated (prothrombin time 15.4±3.6 seconds, partial thromboplastin time 38.6±24.5 seconds, and international normalized ratio 1.4±1.3). Outcomes were worse among COVID-19-positive patients, including longer length of stay (P<0.0001), greater percentage requiring intensive care unit care (P=0.017), and greater rate of neurological worsening during admission (P<0.0001); additionally, more COVID-19-positive patients suffered in-hospital death (33% versus 12.9%, P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Baseline characteristics in patients with stroke were similar comparing those with and without COVID-19. However, COVID-19-positive patients were more likely to experience stroke in a lobar location, more commonly had a cryptogenic cause, and had worse outcomes.","Dhamoon, Mandip S; Thaler, Alison; Gururangan, Kapil; Kohli, Amit; Sisniega, Daniella; Wheelwright, Danielle; Mensching, Connor; Fifi, Johanna T; Fara, Michael G; Jette, Nathalie; Cohen, Ella; Dave, Priya; DiRisio, Aislyn C; Goldstein, Jonathan; Loebel, Emma M; Mayman, Naomi A; Sharma, Akarsh; Thomas, Daniel S; Vega Perez, Ruben D; Weingarten, Mark R; Wen, Huei Hsun; Tuhrim, Stanley; Stein, Laura K",Stroke,347,26

The yet unknown issues are both the early response to the infection, as well as the post-infection development of immunity against the virus under these treatments due to their interaction with the immune system. METHODS: We report two asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) shortly after starting cladribine therapy, both developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response. RESULTS: Patients with MS who are under newly initiated treatment with cladribine tablets may experience an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection and they may develop immunity against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: These observations raise the probability that DMTs with immunosuppressive effects, such as cladribine, may be considered as a treatment option for selected MS patients with high disease activity during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Seferoglu, Meral; Ethemoglu, Özlem; Turan, Ömer Faruk; Siva, Aksel",Neurol. sci,347,1

In this environment, self-direction of home and community-based services, where the participant can hire their own staff and manage a budget that can be used for a broad range of goods and services including home modifications and assistive devices, is seen as a promising intervention. Using self-direction participants can minimize the number of people who enter their homes and pay close family and friends who were already providing many hours of informal care, and now may be unemployed. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services is encouraging this approach. This commentary presents information on how states have responded using the new CMS Toolkit by expanding who can be a paid caregiver, increasing budgets and broadening the kinds of items that can be purchased with budgets to include items like personal protective equipment and supports for telehealth.

ObjectivesHere we use a combination of the Nucleoprotein (NP), the Spike 1 (S1) and Spike 2 (S2) subunits, and the receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of the Spike antigens from the Syrius-CoViDiag(R) multiplex IgG assay, to follow the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection over a long time period and depending on disease severity. ResultsUsing a panel of 209 sera collected from 61 patients up to eight months after infection, we observed that most patients develop an immune response against multiple viral epitope, but anti-S2 antibodies seemed to last longer. For all the tested IgGs, we have found higher titers for hospitalized patients than for non-hospitalized ones. Moreover the combination of the five different IgG titers increased the correlation to the neutralizing antibody titers than if considered individually. ConclusionMultiplex immunoassays have the potential to improve diagnostic performances, especially for ancient infection or mild form of the disease presenting weaker antibody titers. Also the combined detection of anti-NP and anti-Spike-derived domains can be useful to differentiate vaccination from viral infection and accurately assess the antibody potential to neutralize the virus.","Brochot, Etienne; Souplet, Vianney; Follet, Pauline; Ponthieu, Pauline; Olivier, Christophe; Even, Gael; Audebert, Christophe; Malbec, Remi",,347,24

This study aims to describe the responses from the health information systems (HIS) to the COVID-19 pandemic and provide empirical evidence in the application of emerging health technologies in China. METHODS: This observational descriptive study utilized a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of hospitals in China (N = 1,014) from 30 provincial administrative regions across the country. Participants include hospital managers, hospital information workers, and health care providers. RESULTS: Among all the responses, the most popular interventions and applications include expert question-and-answer sessions and science popularization (61.74%) in online medical consultation, online appointment registration (58.97%) in online medical service, and remote consultation (75.15%) in telehealth service. A total of 63.71% of the participating hospitals expanded their fever clinics during the pandemic, 15.38% hospitals used new or upgraded mobile ward rounds systems, and 44.68% hospitals applied online self-service systems. Challenges and barriers include protecting network information security (57.00%) since some hospitals experienced cybersecurity incidents. 71.79% participants hope to shorten wait time and optimize the treatment process. Health care workers experienced increased amount of work during the pandemic, while hospital information departments did not experience significant changes in their workload. CONCLUSION: In the process of fighting against the COVID-19, hospitals have widely used traditional and emerging novel HITs.

It is the seventh member of the family Coronaviridae, which infects humans, after 229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Fever, dry cough and severe pneumonia are seen as common symptoms at the early stages of COVID-19. Some cases progress to acute respiratory stress syndrome, septic shock, organ failure, and death. The development of an effective treatment or vaccination for treating or preventing this lethal condition is an urgent need in order to fight this crisis. Up to now, some effective vaccines with different efficacy profiles have been introduced.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to discuss the evidence related to telehealth medication reviews and provide practical considerations for conducting successful medication reviews by telehealth. DISCUSSION: Leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth technologies had been increasingly used to deliver medication review services, mainly to patients in rural and remote areas, and were accepted by patients. Available evidence suggests telehealth medication reviews may positively affect clinical and cost outcomes, but there are ongoing challenges. When delivering these services, appropriate preparation - using support people, maintaining patients' privacy, selecting the most suitable technology on the basis of individual circumstances and ensuring good communication between healthcare professionals involved in medication review cycle of care - can help produce best results for patients.","Shafiee Hanjani, Leila; Bell, J Simon; Freeman, Christopher",Aust J Gen Pract,347,16

In this study, we have investigated the characteristics and outcomes of patients with AGEP in a tertiary skin hospital. METHODS: From March 2007 to December 2019, medical records of all patients diagnosed with AGEP, were assessed. Demographic data, culprit drug, past medical history, laboratory tests, recurrence, and systemic organ involvement were all documented as well. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients, including 54 women (73%) and 20 men (27%), with a mean age of 44.3 ± 16.5 years were evaluated. The most common comorbidities among the patients were rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. In addition, hydroxychloroquine, cephalosporin, and amoxicillin were found as the three most common medications associated with AGEP induction. Among the study group, seventeen (23%) patients had systemic organ involvement (nine (12.2%), six (8.1%), and five (6.8%) had hepatic, renal and pulmonary involvement, respectively). All patients responded to oral prednisolone within a median of five days (IQR = 4; ranged 2-14). The median duration of treatment was significantly longer in hydroxychloroquine group compared to other drugs (8 versus 5 days; HR 0.57,95%CI 0·35-0.91). Likewise, the median duration of treatment was significantly longer in febrile patients compared to the afebrile ones (7 versus 4 days; HR 0.46, 95%CI 0.25-0.85). Recurrence occurred in six patients after resuming treatment with the same medication. The mean Naranjo score was 7.6 ± 0.9 denoting a probable causal relationship. CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that using hydroxychloroquine and presence of fever are the risk factors potentially leading to a prolonged treatment duration of AGEP.","Nili, Ali; Zarei, Ehsan; Ghamari, Azin; Farid, Ali Salehi; Tavakolpour, Soheil; Daneshpazhooh, Maryam; Mahmoudi, Hamidreza",Int Immunopharmacol,347,33

This study examined trends in sexual orientation disparities in cigarette smoking by race/ethnicity. Data are from the 2014-2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (N = 1,194,768). Trend analyses compared cigarette smoking by race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic other) and sexual orientation (straight, lesbian or gay, bisexual, something else/don't know/refused). Multivariable analyses examined associations between sexual orientation and cigarette use for each race/ethnicity, controlling for other sociodemographic characteristics. Between 2014 and 2019, lesbian or gay, and bisexual populations consistently had higher smoking rates than straight populations, which held across race/ethnicity. Among non-Hispanic White adults, lesbians (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.29, 1.76), bisexual females (OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.39, 1.75), gay (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.22, 1.55), and bisexual males (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.04, 1.43) had higher odds of smoking compared those self-identifying as straight. Among non-Hispanic Black adults, lesbians (OR = 1.90, 95% CI =1.33, 2.73) and bisexual females (OR = 1.85, 95% CI =1.42, 2.41) were more likely to currently smoke. Among Hispanic adults, those self-identifying as lesbian or gay (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.19, 2.09) or bisexual (OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.88, 3.07) were more likely to currently smoke, though the associations were not significant in Hispanic males. Disparities in cigarette smoking by race/ethnicity and sexual orientation suggest that aggregating these groups mask important differences and limit efforts to target those most at risk.","King, Jessica L; Shan, Lingpeng; Azagba, Sunday",Prev Med,347,16

This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV2 pandemic on daily lives of children with MS, and the anxiety status of these patients and anxiety - depression status of their parents. METHODS: This study was performed on a group of pediatric MS patients aged 8-18 years in Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, and Child Neurology Department. Thirty patients with MS and their 30 parents were enrolled to the study. The control group consisted of 49 healthy, age- and sex-matched children and their 49 parents. The patients (and their parents) were asked to complete a web-based survey evaluating access to health care and other changes in daily life between March 11th, 2020 and June 1st, 2020. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) [which is composed of two parts; S-anxiety (STAI-S) and T-anxiety (STAI-T)] was administrated to the patients and healthy controls and the results were compared between the two groups to assess their anxiety levels. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) [which is composed of two parts; HAD-anxiety (HAD-A) and HAD-depression (HAD-D)] was also given to all parents. The results of the HAD tests were compared between the two groups statistically. RESULTS: The results of the web-based survey showed that 4 of 9 (44.4%) patients, who had a regular workout program, left the program and 13 (43.3%) patients put on weight during the pandemic. Twenty-two patients (73.3%) could not get direct exposure to sunlight because of the curfew. Therefore, approximately half of the patients started to take vitamin D supplement. Most of the patients (80%) thought that they had higher risk and believed that they would have severe symptoms compared to healthy people. Twenty one (70%) patients disrupted their regular health checks and the most frequent causes were identified as closure of policlinics to routine patient care (33%) and concerns of getting SARS-CoV2 infection (26,6%). Two of 3 patients who had an MS attack did not go to the doctor during this period. The mean STAI-S scores in MS patients were significantly higher compared to the healthy controls (p=<0.001).

We briefly contemplate all relevant aspects that we believe a specialist in obstetrics and maternal medicine should know, ranging from basic concepts about the disease and protection measures in the obstetric setting to more specific aspects related to maternal-fetal management and childbirth.","López, Marta; Gonce, Anna; Meler, Eva; Plaza, Ana; Hernández, Sandra; Martinez-Portilla, Raigam J; Cobo, Teresa; García, Felipe; Gómez Roig, Maria Dolores; Gratacós, Eduard; Palacio, Montse; Figueras, Francesc",Fetal Diagn Ther,347,16

The non-minimal coupling is expected to be dominant in the strong-gravity regions such as near black-holes or the early Universe. With better instruments planned shortly, electromagnetic fields are an important source of astrophysical observations to test general relativity in strong gravity regimes. However, to precisely test general relativity in strong gravity using electromagnetic fields, it is \emph{imperative} to obtain constraints on the non-minimal coupling parameter to electromagnetic fields. As a step in this direction, we calculate the deflection angle of non-minimally coupled electromagnetic fields in the vicinity of a dynamical, spherically symmetric black hole described by the Sultana-Dyer metric. We compare the deflection angle of the photon modes for the Sultana-Dyer black hole with the Schwarzschild black hole. We show that the difference in the deflection angle for the Schwarzschild black hole is always negative, while for Sultana-Dyer is always positive. Thus, our analysis points out that the two black holes provide a distinct signature irrespective of the black hole mass. We discuss the implications of the results for future astrophysical observations.","Jana, Susmita; Shankaranarayanan, S.",,347,16

We took successively smaller subsamples of these data to evaluate sensitivity, reliability, and reproducibility. In null data having no correlation within or between blocks, both methods showed equivalent false positive rates across sample sizes. Both methods also showed equivalent detection in data with weak but reliable effects until sample sizes drop below n=50. In the case of strong effects, both methods showed similar performance unless the correlations of items within one data block were high. For PLS, the results were reproducible across sample sizes for strong effects, except at the smallest sample sizes. On the contrary, the reproducibility for CCA declined when the within-block correlations were high. This was ameliorated if a principal components analysis (PCA) was performed and the component scores used to calculate the cross-block matrix. The outcome of our examination gives three messages. First, for data with reasonable within and between block structure, CCA and PLS give comparable results. Second, if there are high correlations within either block, this can compromise the reliability of CCA results. This known issue of CCA can be remedied with PCA before cross-block calculation. This, however, assumes that the PCA structure is stable for a given sample. Third, null hypothesis testing does not guarantee that the results are reproducible, even with large sample sizes. This final outcome suggests that both statistical significance and reproducibility be assessed for any data.","McIntosh, Anthony R",,347,1

In the case of developing nations such as the resource of Ethiopia, however, the key obstacle is to buy the vaccine and administer it to their people. In the study area, however, the degree of adherence to the covid-19 preventive measure was not well established. The aim of this study is to determine adherence to covid-19 prevention measures in Hossana town. METHODS: From 3 to 29 January 2021, a community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among individuals living in the Hosanna town. We used a sample size of 384. The sample size was distributed to all 8 kebeles in proportion to the size of the households contained in each kebele in the town of Hossana. Systematic sampling methods were used and both descriptive and advanced analysis, data was entered into Epi-data and exported to SPSS. Binary logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with adherence to preventive measures for covid-19. RESULT: 50.4% of the study participants had good adherence with the COVID-19 preventive measures. 145 (38.5%) of all respondents had poor knowledge on COVID-19 preventive measures and 40.3 % had poor COVID-19 transmission methods knowledge.

This study aimed to assess the level and associated factors of fear and depression amid the COVID-19 pandemic among the adult population of Bangladesh. Methods: After providing informed consent, 1050 participants completed the cross-sectional online survey tool. Depressive symptoms and fear were assessed through the PHQ-9 and validated fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), respectively. Linear regression analysis was performed to predict potential factors of fear and depression. Results: The study finds that females had higher scores for fear of COVID-19 scale (ß1' = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.15 to 2.47) and Patient Health Questionnaire (ß2' = 1.92; 95% CI: 0.95 to 2.88) than their male counterpart. Respondents considering the virus to be extremely dangerous had higher scores for FCV-19S (ß1' = 1.55; 95% CI: 0.66 to 2.44) and PHQ-9 (ß2 = 1.59; 95% CI: 0.25 to 2.92). Similarly, respondents considering themselves unsafe and very worried about the virus had increased scores for both FCV-19S and PHQ-9. On other hand, people those were reluctant to use masks (ß1' = -1.58; 95% CI: -3.12 to -0.04) or seek doctors' advice (ß1' = -0.93; 95% CI: -1.83 to -0.02) if COVID-19 symptoms appear, had comparatively lower scores for FCV-19S.

The Training Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition sought to understand how COVID-19 has affected pediatric gastroenterology fellowship training. METHODS: A 21 question survey was distributed to all 77 pediatric gastroenterology fellowship program directors (PDs) in the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition program director database via email on April 7. Responses collected through April 19, 2020 were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Fifty-one of 77 (66%) PDs from the United States, Canada, and Mexico responded to the survey. Forty-six of 51 (90%) PDs reported that they were under a ""stay-at-home"" order for a median of 4 weeks at the time of the survey. Two of the 51 (4%) programs had fellows participating in outpatient telehealth before COVID-19 and 39 of 51 (76%) at the time of the survey. Fellows stopped participating in outpatient clinics in 22 of 51 (43%) programs and endoscopy in 26 of 51 (52%) programs. Changes to inpatient care included reduced fellow staffing, limiting who entered patient rooms, and rounding remotely. Fellows in 3 New York programs were deployed to adult medicine units. Didactics were moved to virtual conferences in 47 of 51 (94%) programs, and fellows used various online resources. Clinical research and, disproportionately, bench research were restricted.

As outbreaks have spread throughout prisons and detention centers, detainees have organized collectively to demand life-saving measures. Chief among these demands has been the call for decarceration: the release of detainees and inmates to prevent exposure to COVID-19. This paper theorizes the compounding racial vulnerability that has led to such a marked spread behind bars, mainly among race-class subjugated communities. METHODS: We use journalistic sources and administrative data to provide an in-depth account of the spread of COVID-19 in American correctional facilities and of the mobilization to reduce contagions. We also use two survey experiments to describe public support for harm reduction and decarceration demands and measure the effects of information about (a) racial inequalities in prison, and (b) poor conditions inside migrant detention centers. FINDINGS: We find that only one-third to one-half of respondents believe that response to COVID-19 in prisons and immigrant detention centers should be a high priority. We also find that Americans are much more supportive of harm reduction measures like improved sanitation than of releasing people from prisons and detention centers. Information about racial disparities increases support for releasing more people from prison. We do not find any significant effect of information about poor conditions in migrant detention centers. CONCLUSIONS: The conditions in prisons and migrant detention centers during the pandemic-and public opinion about them-highlight the realities of compounding racialized vulnerability in the United States.","Denney, Matthew G T; Garibaldo Valdez, Ramon",J. health polit. policy law,347,26

Access to resources and training outside the classroom can be carried out from various platforms. Following this line, Twitch is an interactive video transmission platform that is presented as an interesting digital resource to enhance the motivation of students in turning over learning moments. The objective of the study is to analyze the motivation of students in two different methodological approaches, one traditional and the other innovative through the Twitch application. A quasi-experimental pre-post design was carried out. A total of 52 Spanish students from the fourth level of secondary education participated in the research. Data collection was carried out by adapting the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) instrument to the Spanish context. The results reflect higher levels of motivation in the implementation of Twitch with respect to its materialization without using said techno-pedagogical complement. This difference is especially significant in intrinsic motivation, since in the case of extrinsic motivation, the difference between both pedagogical proposals is smaller. In short, the implementation of Twitch in the flipped learning supposes an optimization of this pedagogical methodology, increasing the extrinsic and intrinsic motivation of the students and modifying the centers of interest of students from quantitative aspects to other, qualitative ones.","Pozo-Sánchez, Santiago López-Belmonte Jesús Fuentes-Cabrera Arturo López-Núñez Juan-Antonio",Sustainability,347,17

Therefore, a coordinated global response is needed to prepare health care systems to face this unprecedented challenge. Proper human resource management can increase nurses' productivity and quality of care. Therefore, the present study aims to explore the nursing managers' perception of nursing workforce management during the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: This is a qualitative study with conventional content analysis using Granheim and Landman approach. In this study, 15 nursing managers were selected by purposeful sampling method. Data were collected using in-depth semi-structured interviews. Ethical considerations were applied to all stages of the study. In this study, MAXQDA software version 10 was used to help manage the data. RESULTS: 66% of the participants (10/5) were female. The mean age of participants was 44 years, mean work experience of 19 years, and mean management experience of 9 years. Three categories and seven sub-categories emerged from the data analysis: 1) management of workforce recruitment (volunteer workforces, non-volunteer workforces), 2) management of workforce arrangement (flexible work schedule, rearrangement of the workforce), and 3) management of workforce retention (preventive measures, motivational measures, and psychological support). CONCLUSION: Management in critical situations requires the use of flexible and situational management principles to recruit, arrange and retain workforce, and also to compensate for the lack of manpower.","Poortaghi, Sarieh; Shahmari, Mehraban; Ghobadi, Akram",BMC Nurs,347,26

This study sought to quantify the change in dental visits in 2020 compared with 2019. METHODS: This retrospective, observational study examined the percentage change in weekly visits to dental offices by state (inclusive of the District of Columbia), nationally, and by county-level COVID-19 incidence using geographic information from the mobile applications of 45 million smartphones during 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: From March through August 2020, weekly visits to dental offices were 33% lower, on average, than in 2019. Weekly visits were 34% lower, on average, in counties with the highest COVID-19 rates. The greatest decline was observed during the week of April 12, 2020, when there were 66% fewer weekly visits to dental offices. The 5 states (inclusive of the District of Columbia) with the greatest declines in weekly visits from 2019 through 2020, ranging from declines of 38% through 53%, were California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly visits to US dental offices declined drastically during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although rates of weekly visits rebounded substantially by June 2020, rates remain about 20% lower than the prior year as of August 2020. These findings highlight the economic challenges faced by dentists owing to the pandemic. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: States exhibited widespread variation in rates of declining visits during the pandemic, suggesting that dental practices may need to consider different approaches to reopening and encouraging patients to return depending on location.","Kranz, Ashley M; Chen, Annie; Gahlon, Grace; Stein, Bradley D",,347,16

METHODS: We present two cases of patients who underwent rebubbling of a partially detached DMEK grafts at the slit lamp following DMEK surgery without peripheral iridotomy. The rebubbling was performed with a 27-gauge needle attached to a 1ml syringe and the patients seated at the slit lamp. Air was injected into the anterior chamber until a 50% air fill was achieved. The patients were instructed to lie supine for 30 min in clinic and the remainder of the day at home. RESULTS: We performed two rebubbling procedures at the slit lamp using the standard needle and syringe. Both cases achieved 50% air fills without any complications. At 3 days post-procedure the air bubble had resolved and the graft appeared attached centrally and at day 14 post-procedure the two patients had a clear and attached corneal graft with corrected visual acuity of 6/7.5 and 6/9, respectively. CONCLUSION: Rebubbling of detached DMEK grafts at the slit lamp with 50% air fill in the anterior chamber is a relatively simple and effective procedure. This provides an alternative approach for managing the complication of partially detached DMEK grafts in the era of COVID-19 with limited operating theatre access and avoids the risk of complications such as pupillary block in 'PI-less' DMEK.","Franka, Mustafa; Mistry, Meera; Moustafa, Mohanad; Erikitola, Ore-Oluwa; Lyall, Douglas",Eur J Ophthalmol,347,16

We adopt Actor Network Theory (ANT) and the Natural Inventory Model to support our argument that nature consists of both human and non-human. From our observation about the Covid-19 crisis and by consulting the existing relevant literature on CSR, Covid-19, non-financial reporting and integrated reports (IR), we propose the implication of non-financial reporting by companies based on a theoretical framework. We recommend that companies should implement/adopt Circular Economy concept for sustainable business model and report on biodiversity and extinction accounting in more structured and mandatory way via producing IR to create value on short, medium and long terms. This is the first paper to tackle the Covid-19 crisis and offer solution for future reporting. The findings will add value in the academia and society.","Hassan, Abeer; Elamer, Ahmed A; Lodh, Suman; Roberts, Lee; Nandy, Monomita",,347,6

The foxglove aphid (FA: Aulacorthum solani Kaltenbach) is an important insect pest that causes serious yield losses in soybean. The FA resistance gene Raso2 from wild soybean PI 366121 was previously mapped to a 13 cM interval on soybean chromosome 7. However, fine-mapping of Raso2 was needed to improve the effectiveness of marker-assisted selection (MAS) and to eventually clone it. The objectives of this study were to fine-map Raso2 from PI 366121 using Axiom® 180 K SoyaSNP array, to confirm the resistance and inheritance of Raso2 in a different background, and to identify candidate gene(s). The 105 F4:8 recombinant inbred lines were used to fine-map the gene and to test antibiosis and antixenosis of Raso2 to FA. These efforts resulted in the mapping of Raso2 on 1 cM interval which corresponds to 77 Kb containing eight annotated genes based on the Williams 82 reference genome assembly (Wm82.a2.v1). Interestingly, all nonsynonymous substitutions were in Glyma.07g077700 which encodes the disease resistance protein containing LRR domain and expression of the gene in PI 366121 was significantly higher than that in Williams 82. In addition, distinct SNPs within Glyma.07g077700 that can distinguish PI 366121 and diverse FA-susceptible soybeans were identified. We also confirmed that Raso2 presented the resistance to FA and the Mendelian inheritance for single dominant gene in a different background. The results of this study would provide fundamental information on MAS for development of FA-resistant cultivars as well as functional study and cloning of the candidate gene in soybean.","Kim, Ki-Seung; Kim, Ji-Min; Jung, Jiyeong; Shin, Ilseob; Park, Sumin; Lee, Ju Seok; Jeong, Soon-Chun; Lee, Jeong-Dong; Jung, Jin Kyo; Ha, Bo-Keun; Kang, Sungtaeg",Theor. appl. genet,347,1

METHODS: Agent-based modelling RESULTS: The likelihood of the presence of an outbreak in a care home is associated with the care home population size. Cohorting of residents and staff into smaller, self-contained units reduces the spread of COVID-19. Restricting the number of visitors to the care home to shield its residents does not significantly impact the cumulative number of infected residents and risk of outbreak occurrence in most scenarios. Only when the community prevalence where staff live is considerably lower than the prevalence where visitors live (the former prevalence is less than or equal to 30% of the latter), relaxing visitation increases predicted infections much more significantly than it does in other scenarios. Maintaining a low infection probability per resident-visitor contact helps reduce the effect of allowing more visitors into care homes. CONCLUSIONS: Our model predictions suggest that cohorting is effective in controlling the spread of COVID-19 in care homes. However, according to predictions shielding residents in care homes is not as effective as predicted in a number of studies that have modelled shielding of vulnerable population in the wider communities.","Nguyen, Le Khanh Ngan; Howick, Susan; McLafferty, Dennis; Anderson, Gillian Hopkins; Pravinkumar, Sahaya Josephine; Van Der Meer, Robert; Megiddo, Itamar",Am. j. infect. control,347,21

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe clinical characteristics and clinical course of ICU COVID-19 patients, and to determine risk factors for ICU mortality of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Prospective, multicentre, cohort study that enrolled critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted into 30 ICUs from Spain and Andorra. Consecutive patients from March 12th to May 26th, 2020 were enrolled if they had died or were discharged from ICU during the study period. Demographics, symptoms, vital signs, laboratory markers, supportive therapies, pharmacological treatments, medical and infectious complications were reported and compared between deceased and discharged patients. RESULTS: A total of 663 patients were included. Overall ICU mortality was 31% (203 patients). At ICU admission non-survivors were more hypoxemic [SpO2 with non-rebreather mask, 90 (IQR 83 to 93) vs. 91 (IQR 87 to 94); P<.001] and with higher sequential organ failure assessment score [SOFA, 7 (IQR 5 to 9) vs. 4 (IQR 3 to 7); P<.001]. Complications were more frequent in non-survivors: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (95% vs. 89%; P=.009), acute kidney injury (AKI) (58% vs. 24%; P<10-16), shock (42% vs. 14%; P<10-13), and arrhythmias (24% vs. 11%; P<10-4). Respiratory super-infection, bloodstream infection and septic shock were higher in non-survivors (33% vs. 25%; P=.03, 33% vs. 23%; P=.01 and 15% vs. 3%, P=10-7), respectively. The multivariable regression model showed that age was associated with mortality, with every year increasing risk-of-death by 1% (95%CI: 1 to 10, P=.014). Each 5-point increase in APACHE II independently predicted mortality [OR: 1.508 (1.081, 2.104), P=.015]. Patients with AKI [OR: 2.468 (1.628, 3.741), P<10-4)], cardiac arrest [OR: 11.099 (3.389, 36.353), P=.0001], and septic shock [OR: 3.224 (1.486, 6.994), P=.002] had an increased risk-of-death. CONCLUSIONS: Older COVID-19 patients with higher APACHE II scores on admission, those who developed AKI grades ii or iii and/or septic shock during ICU stay had an increased risk-of-death.

There are several open debates, not only about its genetic heterogeneity, or about the possibility to be an acquired cardiomyopathy, but also about its possible overdiagnosis based on imaging techniques. In order to better understand this entity, we identified 38 LVNC patients diagnosed by cardiac MRI (CMRI) or anatomopathological study that could underwent NGS-sequencing and clinical study. Anatomopathological exam was performed in eight available LVNC hearts. The genetic yield was 34.2%. Patients with negative genetic testing had better left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or it showed a tendency to improve in follow-up, and a possible trigger factor for LVNC was identified in 1/3 of them. Nonetheless, cerebrovascular accidents occurred in similar proportions in both groups. We conclude that in LVNC there seem to be different ways to achieve the same final phenotype. Genetic testing has a good genetic yield and provides valuable information. LVNC without an underlying genetic cause may have a better prognosis in terms of LVEF evolution. However, anticoagulation to prevent cerebrovascular accident (CVA) should be carefully evaluated in all patients.

Italy registered the third highest number of COVID-19 cases in the world and the second highest in Europe. An anonymous online survey composed of 40 questions has been sent to dentists practicing in the area of Modena and Reggio Emilia, one of the areas in Italy most affected by COVID-19. The survey was aimed at highlighting the practical and emotional consequences of COVID-19 emergence on daily clinical practice. Specifically, it assessed dentists' behavioral responses, emotions and concerns following the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic restrictive measures introduced by the Italian national administrative order of 10 March 2020 (DM-10M20), as well as the dentists' perception of infection likelihood for themselves and patients. Furthermore, the psychological impact of COVID-19 was assessed by means of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 test (GAD-7), that measures the presence and severity of anxiety symptoms. Using local dental associations (ANDI-Associazione Nazionale Dentisti Italiani, CAO-Commissione Albo Odontoiatri) lists, the survey was sent by email to all dentists in the district of Modena and Reggio Emilia (874 practitioners) and was completed by 356 of them (40%). All dental practitioners closed or reduced their activity to urgent procedures, 38.2% prior to and 61.8% after the DM-10M20. All reported a routinely use of the most common protective personal equipment (PPE), but also admitted that the use of PPE had to be modified during COVID-19 pandemic. A high percentage of patients canceled their previous appointments after the DM-10M20. Almost 85% of the dentists reported being worried of contracting the infection during clinical activity. The results of the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) evaluation showed that 9% of respondents reported a severe anxiety. To conclude, the COVID-19 emergency is having a highly negative impact on the activity of dentists practicing in the area of Modena and Reggio Emilia.

National guidelines for treatment and prevention, patient recoveries and discharge, and public health control measures should be based on research performed in the appropriate context for them to be effective and robust. Urgent research is needed in viral immunology and shedding, treatment and prevention trials, protection of healthcare personnel, and antimicrobial use among others. In this article, we propose ten research questions that when answered in a timely manner by scientists in Africa, will enhance Africa's response to the pandemic.

One promising approach for addressing these challenges is gene set testing, or pathway analysis, which can mitigate sparsity and noise, and improve interpretation and power, by aggregating expression data to the pathway level. Unfortunately, methods optimized for bulk transcriptomics perform poorly on scRNA-seq data and progress on single cell-specific techniques has been limited. Importantly, no existing methods support cell-level gene set inference. To address this challenge, we developed a new gene set testing method, Variance-adjusted Mahalanobis (VAM), that integrates with the Seurat framework and can accommodate the technical noise, sparsity and large sample sizes characteristic of scRNA-seq data. The VAM method computes cell-specific pathway scores to transform a cell-by-gene matrix into a cell-by-pathway matrix that can be used for both data visualization and statistical enrichment analysis. Because the distribution of these scores under the null of uncorrelated technical noise has an accurate gamma approximation, both population and cell-level inference is supported. As demonstrated using simulated and real scRNA-seq data, the VAM method provides superior classification accuracy at a lower computation cost relative to existing single sample gene set testing approaches.","Frost, Hildreth Robert",Nucleic acids res,347,15

The purpose of this study is to investigate the risk factors of symptoms onset and clinical features in asymptomatic COVID-19 infected patients. Methods: A retrospective study was performed in 70 asymptomatic COVID-2019 infected patients confirmed by nucleic acid tests in Hunan province, China between 28 January 2020 and 18 February, 2020. The epidemiological, clinical features and laboratory data were reviewed and analyzed. Presence or absence at the onset of symptoms was taken as the outcome. A Cox regression model was performed to evaluate the potential predictors of the onset of symptoms. Results: The study included 36 males and 34 females with a mean age of 33.24±20.40 years (range, 0.5-84 years). There were 22 asymptomatic carriers developed symptoms during hospitalization isolated observation, and diagnosed as confirmed cases, while 48 cases remained asymptomatic throughout the course of disease. Of 70 asymptomatic patients, 14 (14/70, 20%) had underlying diseases, 3 (3/70, 4.3%) had drinking history, and 11 (11/70, 15.7%) had smoking history. 22 patients developed symptoms onset of fever (4/22, 18.2%), cough (13/22, 59.1%), chest discomfort (2/22, 9.1%), fatigue (1/22, 4.5%), pharyngalgia (1/22, 4.5%) during hospitalization; only one (1/22, 4.5%) patient developed signs of both cough and pharyngalgia. Abnormalities on chest CT were detected among 35 of the 69 patients (50.7%) after admission, except for one pregnant woman had not been examined. 4 (4/70, 5.7%) and 8 (8/70, 11.4%) cases showed leucopenia and lymphopenia. With the effective antiviral treatment, all the 70 asymptomatic infections had been discharged, none cases developed severe pneumonia, admission to intensive care unit, or died. The mean time from nucleic acid positive to negative was 13.2±6.84 days. Cox regression analysis showed that smoking history (P=0.028, hazard ratio=4.49, 95% CI 1.18-17.08) and existence of pulmonary disease (P=0.038, hazard ratio=7.09, 95% CI 1.12-44.90) were risk factors of the onset of symptoms in asymptomatic carries. Conclusion: The initially asymptomatic patients can develop mild symptoms and have a good prognosis. History of smoking and pulmonary disease was prone to illness onset in asymptomatic patients, and it is necessary to be highly vigilant to those patients.","Tao, Pei-Yao; Leng, Ling; Liu, Kun; Zhou, Ri-Hua; Hu, Yue-Chun; Wu, Shang-Jie; Xiao, Yu-Dong; Liu, Jun",Int J Med Sci,347,21

Patient satisfaction was assessed with a questionnaire. Determinants of satisfaction (age, sex, smoking, presence of diabetes or cardiovascular disease, pain in other joints, preoperative arthritic stage) and components of satisfaction (slope variation, mechanical axis variation, outlier final alignment, surgeon experience) were examined to identify which variables correlated with positive outcome. Correlations with septic and mechanicals failures were also evaluated. Thirteen percent of patients were unsatisfied, despite good results in KOOS, WOMAC and FJS-12 tests. Female gender, low Kellgren–Lawrence grade and the presence of back pain and pain in other joints were factors associated with poor clinical results. Poorer clinical results were also reported in younger patients. Infection rate was correlated with active smoking and mechanical failure with an outlier final alignment. Comorbidities, smoking habits and high expectations have a big influence on TKA results and on final satisfaction after surgery.","Rissolio, Lorenzo Sabatini Luigi Risitano Salvatore Bistolfi Alessandro Galluzzo Umberto Massè Alessandro Indelli Pier Francesco",Journal of Clinical Medicine,347,16

Antivirals against coronaviruses do not exist, hence global drug repurposing efforts have been carried out to identify agents that may provide clinical benefit to patients with COVID-19. Itraconazole, an antifungal agent, has been reported to have activity against animal coronaviruses. Using cell-based phenotypic assays, the in vitro antiviral activity of itraconazole and 17-OH itraconazole was assessed against clinical isolates from a German and Belgian patient infected with SARS-CoV-2. Itraconazole demonstrated antiviral activity in human Caco-2 cells (EC50 = 2.3 µM; MTT assay). Similarly, its primary metabolite, 17-OH itraconazole, showed inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 activity (EC50 = 3.6 µM). Remdesivir inhibited viral replication with an EC50 = 0.4 µM. Itraconazole and 17-OH itraconazole resulted in a viral yield reduction in vitro of approximately 2-log10 and approximately 1-log10 , as measured in both Caco-2 cells and VeroE6-eGFP cells, respectively. The viral yield reduction brought about by remdesivir or GS-441524 (parent nucleoside of the antiviral prodrug remdesivir; positive control) was more pronounced, with an approximately 3-log10 drop and >4-log10 drop in Caco-2 cells and VeroE6-eGFP cells, respectively. Itraconazole and 17-OH itraconazole exert in vitro low micromolar activity against SARS-CoV-2. Despite the in vitro antiviral activity, itraconazole did not result in a beneficial effect in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a clinical study (EudraCT Number: 2020-001243-15).

MS appears not to be a risk factor for severe adverse COVID-19 outcomes (though patients with advanced disability or a progressive phenotype are at higher risk). Disease-modifying therapy (DMT)-based care appears generally safe for patients with MS who develop COVID-19 (although there may be an increased risk of adverse outcomes with anti-CD20 therapy). Interferon-ß, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab and cladribine tablets are unlikely to increase the risk of infection; fingolimod, anti-CD20 agents and alemtuzumab may confer an intermediate risk. Existing DMT therapy should be continued at this time. For patients requiring initiation of a DMT, all currently available DMTs except alemtuzumab can be started safely at this time; initiate alemtuzumab subject to careful individual risk-benefit considerations. Patients should receive vaccination against COVID-19 where possible, with no interruption of existing DMT-based care. There is no need to alter the administration of interferon-ß, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, fingolimod or cladribine tablets for vaccination; new starts on other DMTs should be delayed for up to 6 weeks after completion of vaccination to allow the immune response to develop. Doses of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine may be scheduled around doses of anti-CD20 or alemtuzumab. Where white cell counts are suppressed by treatment, these should be allowed to recover before vaccination.","Inshasi, Jihad; Alroughani, Raed; Al-Asmi, Abdullah; Alkhaboury, Jaber; Alsalti, Abdullah; Boshra, Amir; Canibano, Beatriz; Deleu, Dirk; Ahmed, Samar Farouk; Shatila, Ahmed; Thakre, Mona",,347,10

Human coronaviruses known to date, common throughout the world, are seven. The most common-and least harmful-ones were discovered in the 1960s and cause a common cold. Others, more dangerous, identified in the early 2000s and cause more severe respiratory tract infections.

The effluent organic matters (EfOM) are well-known photosensitizers for the generation of reactive species, mainly including the triplet states of EfOM (3EfOM*), singlet oxygen (1O2) and hydroxyl radical (â¢OH), which contribute to the removal of trace pollutants in water. However, the effect of UV254 disinfection on the photoreactivity of EfOM remains unclear. Here we investigated the photophysical and photochemical properties variation of EfOM after UV254 disinfection, along with humic substances (HS) as comparison. The UV254 disinfection caused a decrease of aromaticity, fluorescence intensity and molecular weight for all samples, while a reduction formation of triplet state of these dissolved organic matters (3DOM*), 1O2, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and superoxide anions (O2â¢-) under simulated sunlight was observed. In contrast, the generation of â¢OH was increased after UV254 disinfection. The quantum yield of 1O2 was positively correlated with triplet quantum yield coefficient (fTMP) in all cases. However, the quantum yield of â¢OH exhibited positive and negative correlations with fTMP for EfOM and HS, respectively. The quantum yields showed positive correlations with E2/E3 (ratio of the absorbance at 254 to 365 nm) for untreated DOM samples, while for the first time we found the trends differ distinctly after UV254 disinfection. These findings indicate that UV254 disinfection in WWTPs significantly increases the potential of â¢OH photoproduction from effluents and the cost-effective solar irradiation after UV254 disinfection is expected to be a novel technique for further removal of pathogen and trace organic pollutants in wastewater effluents and receiving waters.","Wan, Dong; Kong, Yaqian; Selvinsimpson, Steplinpaulselvin; Luo, Fan; Chen, Yong",Water Res,347,23

Additionally, innumerable lateral flow test devices are frequently used for determination of different clinical parameters, food safety, and environmental factors. Since common LFAs rely on non-biodegradable nitrocellulose membranes, we focused on their replacement by cellulose-composed, biodegradable papers. We report the development of cellulose paper-based lateral flow immunoassays using a carbohydrate-binding module-fused to detection antibodies. Studies regarding the protein binding capacity and potential protein wash-off effects on cellulose paper demonstrated a 2.7-fold protein binding capacity of CBM-fused antibody fragments compared to the sole antibody fragment. Furthermore, this strategy improved the spatial retention of CBM-fused detection antibodies to the test area, which resulted in an enhanced sensitivity and improved overall LFA-performance compared to the naked detection antibody. CBM-assisted antibodies were validated by implementation into two model lateral flow test devices (pregnancy detection and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies). The CBM-assisted pregnancy LFA demonstrated sensitive detection of human gonadotropin (hCG) in synthetic urine and the CBM-assisted Covid-19 antibody LFA was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies present in serum. Our findings pave the way to the more frequent use of cellulose-based papers instead of nitrocellulose in LFA devices and thus potentially improve the sustainability in the field of POC diagnostics.","Elter, Adrian; Bock, Tina; Spiehl, Dieter; Russo, Giulio; Hinz, Steffen C; Bitsch, Sebastian; Baum, Eva; Langhans, Markus; Meckel, Tobias; Dörsam, Edgar; Kolmar, Harald; Schwall, Gerhard",Sci Rep,347,23

Generally, single-cell RNA data analysis pipelines include data normalization, size reduction, and unsupervised clustering. However, different normalization and size reduction methods will significantly affect the results of clustering and cell type enrichment analysis. Choices of preprocessing paths is crucial in scRNA-Seq data mining, because a proper preprocessing path can extract more important information from complex raw data and lead to more accurate clustering results. RESULTS: We proposed a method called NDRindex (Normalization and Dimensionality Reduction index) to evaluate data quality of outcomes of normalization and dimensionality reduction methods. The method includes a function to calculate the degree of data aggregation, which is the key to measuring data quality before clustering. For the five single-cell RNA sequence datasets we tested, the results proved the efficacy and accuracy of our index. CONCLUSIONS: This method we introduce focuses on filling the blanks in the selection of preprocessing paths, and the result proves its effectiveness and accuracy. Our research provides useful indicators for the evaluation of RNA-Seq data.","Xiao, Ruiyu; Lu, Guoshan; Guo, Wanqian; Jin, Shuilin",BMC Bioinformatics,347,21

The country's economy is now almost fully halted, people are stuck up and investment becomes deteriorating. So, this is turning to worry of the government for a development and health. Health organizations are often desperate for evolving decision-making innovations to overcome this viral virus and encourage people to receive rapid and effective responses in real-time. Thus, it is important to create auto-mechanisms as a preventive shield to ensure healthy humanity against SARS-CoV-2.

Physical proximity to other workers and shared equipment can facilitate disease transmission in these settings (2-4). The disproportionate number of foreign-born workers employed in meat and poultry processing reflects structural, social, and economic inequities that likely contribute to an increased COVID-19 incidence in this population* (5). In May 2020, the Maryland Department of Health and CDC investigated factors that might affect person-to-person SARS-CoV-2 transmission among persons who worked at two poultry processing facilities. A survey administered to 359 workers identified differences in risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection between workers born outside the United States and U.S.-born workers. Compared with U.S.-born workers, foreign-born workers had higher odds of working in fixed locations on the production floor (odds ratio [OR] for cutup and packaging jobs = 4.8), of having shared commutes (OR = 1.9), and of living with other poultry workers (OR = 6.0). They had lower odds of participating in social gatherings (OR for visits to family = 0.2; OR for visits to friends = 0.4), and they visited fewer businesses in the week before the survey than did their U.S.-born coworkers. Some workplace risk factors can be mitigated through engineering and administrative controls focused on the production floor, and this will be of particular benefit to the foreign-born workers concentrated in these areas. Employers and health departments can also partner with local organizations to disseminate culturally and linguistically tailored messages about risk reduction behaviors in community settings, including shared transportation§ and household members dwelling in close quarters.¶.","Rubenstein, Beth L; Campbell, Stefanie; Meyers, Alysha R; Crum, David A; Mitchell, Clifford S; Hutson, Jeré; Williams, D039; Ann, L; Senesie, Schabbethai S; Gilani, Zunera; Reynolds, Steven; Alba, Bianca; Tavitian, Stephanie; Billings, Kristian; Saintus, Lina; Martin, Stephen B; Mainzer, Hugh",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,347,23

While much has been described in the literature about lung infiltrates and respiratory failure associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), pneumothorax remains a relatively rare presentation with current literature indicating a rate of one percent. We describe a case series of three patients each of whom tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal swab specimens and presented with pneumothorax. These patients were treated at the New York City Health and Hospitals (NYC H+H) system, a network of eleven hospitals in four different boroughs of New York City. None of these patients had a history of lung disease and one patient was a previous smoker. One out of three patients died. Inflammatory markers were noted to be elevated in each of these patients to levels that have been associated with severe COVID-19 infection. CT scans in these patients showed bilateral air space disease consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia and pneumothorax with other features including pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumatoceles. This may indicate the underlying pathogenesis of pneumothorax in these patients to involve inflammation-induced pulmonary parenchymal injury and necrosis with subsequent development of air leaks into the pleural cavity, a mechanism similar to that noted in patients during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. Conservative management with chest tube drainage or observation was adequate for two of three patients while one patient developed multi-organ system dysfunction and eventual death.","Mallick, Taha; Dinesh, Anant; Engdahl, Ryan; Sabado, Mario",Cureus,347,30

In this prospective study we provide an analysis of resource utilization as a function of outcomes for all MDCs covered by an entire radiology section and provide a time-based cost estimate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following institutional review board approval, prospective data on all MDCs covered by abdominal radiologists at a single tertiary care academic center were obtained over nine weeks. A predefined questionnaire was used by a single observer who attended every imaging review and recorded the total time spent by the radiologists and several outcome measures. The total time recorded was used to provide a time-based cost estimate using a national salary survey. RESULTS: Six radiologists participated in a total of 57 MDCs, with 577 cases reviewed and discussed. 181 (31%) cases were performed at outside facilities requiring full reinterpretation. Clinically significant revisions to original reports were recorded in 107 (18.5%) cases. Radiologist input directly resulted in alteration of cancer staging in 65 (11%) patients and specific recommendations for follow-up diagnostic workup in 280 (48%) of cases. The mean total time devoted by the staff radiologist per week to MDCs was 18.7 hours/week, nearly a half of full-time effort, or 8% of total effort per radiologist. The total annual projected cost of radiology coverage for each weekly MDC was $26,920. CONCLUSION: Section-wide radiologist participation in MDCs directly resulted in change in clinical management in nearly half of reviewed cases. This was achieved at a notable time cost, highlighting the need for efficient integration of radiology MDC participation into radiologist workflow and compensation models.","Shenoy-Bhangle, Anuradha S; Putta, Niharika; Adondakis, Michael; Rawson, James; Tsai, Leo L",Acad. radiol,347,5

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of PSU among Chinese community adults and adopted a social-cognitive theory and social axiom framework to evaluate the effects of beliefs on PSU. A Chinese adult sample (N = 616) was obtained through probability sampling via a telephone survey from Macao, China and included 591 smartphone users' data (39.4% men) for formal analysis. The prevalence of PSU was 43.3% in the overall sample, with 41.9% in women, and 45.5% in men. Two types of beliefs derived from the social-cognitive theory, pandemic-related self-efficacy and government efficacy, both showed significant and negative correlations with PSU (r = -0.13 and -0.10, p < 0.05). As for the two beliefs from the social axiom framework, reward for application was negatively correlated with PSU (r = -0.10, p < 0.05), whereas social cynicism was positively associated with PSU (r = 0.25, p < 0.001). Among those four beliefs, social cynicism exerted the most substantial effect on PSU when controlling for demographics. Our findings enriched the understanding of PSU during the pandemic and provided empirical direction regarding cognition-based intervention strategies for reducing PSU.","Zhang, Meng Xuan; Chen, Juliet Honglei; Tong, Kwok Kit; Yu, Eilo Wing-Yat; Wu, Anise M S",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),347,24

Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures. This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR+Q). The SEIR+Q dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020. The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.","Wei, Yongyue; Wei, Liangmin; Jiang, Yue; Shen, Sipeng; Zhao, Yang; Hao, Yuantao; Du, Zhicheng; Tang, Jinling; Zhang, Zhijie; Jiang, Qingwu; Li, Liming; Chen, Feng; Shen, Hongbing",,347,16

We performed a quality improvement study to monitor and improve face-mask compliance among healthcare personnel (HCP) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. DESIGN: Mixed-methods study. SETTING: Tertiary-care center in West Haven, Connecticut. PATIENTS: HCP including physicians, nurses, and ancillary staff. METHODS: Face-mask compliance was measured through direct observations during a 4-week baseline period after universal masking was mandated. Frontline and management HCP completed semistructured interviews from which a multimodal intervention was developed. Direct observations were repeated during a 14-week period following implementation of the multimodal intervention. Differences between units were evaluated with &#967;2 testing using the Bonferroni correction. Face-mask compliance between baseline and intervention periods was compared using time-series regression. RESULTS: Among 1,561 observations during the baseline period, median weekly face-mask compliance was 82.2% (range, 80.8%-84.4%). Semistructured interviews were performed with 16 HCP. Qualitative analysis informed the development of a multimodal intervention consisting of audit and passive feedback, active discussion, and increased communication from leadership. Among 2,651 observations during the intervention period, median weekly face-mask compliance was 92.6% (range, 84.6%-97.9%). There was no difference in weekly face-mask compliance between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 units. The multimodal intervention was associated with an increase in face-mask compliance (ß = 0.023; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Face-mask compliance remained suboptimal among HCP despite a facility-wide mandate for universal masking. A multimodal intervention consisting of audit and passive feedback, active discussion, and increased communication from leadership was effective in increasing face-mask compliance among HCP.","Datta, Rupak; Glenn, Keith; Pellegrino, Anthony; Tuan, Jessica; Linde, Brian; Kayani, Jehanzeb; Patel, Kavin; Calo, Lisbeysi; Dembry, Louise Marie; Fisher, Ann",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,347,20

Several COVID-19 guidelines included age as an explicit factor and practices of both triage and ‘anticipatory triage’ likely limited access to hospital care for elderly patients, especially those in care homes. To ensure the legitimacy of triage guidelines, which affect the public, it is important to engage the public’s moral intuitions. Our study aimed to explore general public views in the UK on the role of age, and related factors like frailty and quality of life, in triage during the COVID-19 pandemic. We held online deliberative workshops with members of the general public (n=22). Participants were guided through a deliberative process to maximise eliciting informed and considered preferences. Participants generally accepted the need for triage but strongly rejected ‘fair innings’ and ‘life projects’ principles as justifications for age-based allocation. They were also wary of the ‘maximise life-years’ principle, preferring to maximise the number of lives rather than life years saved. Although they did not arrive at a unified recommendation of one principle, a concern for three core principles and values eventually emerged: equality, efficiency and vulnerability. While these remain difficult to fully respect at once, they captured a considered, multifaceted consensus: utilitarian considerations of efficiency should be tempered with a concern for equality and vulnerability. This ‘triad’ of ethical principles may be a useful structure to guide ethical deliberation as societies negotiate the conflicting ethical demands of triage.","Kuylen, Margot N.

The ACE2 receptor is present in both female and male reproductive systems, and reports of multi-organ involvement have led to uncertainty regarding its effects on the reproductive system and fertility. We review the existing literature regarding the function of ACE2 and the renin-angiotensin system in the female and male reproductive systems to postulate the possible implications of SARS-CoV-2 regarding fertility. Because of the presence of ACE2 in the ovaries, SARS-CoV-2 infection may disrupt ovarian function and hence oocyte quality. Higher expression of ACE2 in the endometrium with age and during the secretory phase raises concern about increased susceptibility to infection during periods of high ACE2 expression. The possibility of vertical transmission and the presence of ACE2 in the placenta and during pregnancy are also discussed. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in semen is controversial, but impaired semen quality has been found in men with moderate coronavirus disease 2019 infection. Evidence of orchitis and hormonal changes seen in male coronavirus disease 2019 infection may lead to infertility. The implications of these effects on assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes are also explored. The ART guidelines from different fertility societies for the management of patients treated with ART are provided. The importance of prioritising 'time-sensitive' patients for ART, counselling patients about the uncertainty and risks of ART, and pregnancy during the pandemic is discussed. Recommendations are also provided for infection control and safe regulation of ART centres and laboratories.","Lee, W Y; Mok, A; Chung, J P W",Hong Kong Med J,347,13

This enzyme has important functions in the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system to preserve cardiovascular function. In addition to the heart, it is expressed in many tissues including the lung, intestines, brain, and kidney, however, its functions in these organs are mostly unknown. ACE-2 has membrane-bound and soluble forms. Its expression levels are altered in disease states and by a variety of medications. Currently, it is not clear how altered ACE-2 levels influence ACE-2 virulence and relevant complications. In addition, membrane-bound and soluble forms are thought to have different effects. Most work on this topic in the literature is on the SARS-CoV virus that has a high genetic resemblance to SARS-Co-V-2 and also uses ACE-2 enzyme to enter the cell, but with much lower affinity. More recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 are mainly clinical studies aiming at relating the effect of medications that are thought to influence ACE-2 levels, with COVID-19 outcomes for patients under these medications. This review paper aims to summarize what is known about the relationship between ACE-2 levels and SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 virulence under altered ACE-2 expression states.","Yalcin, Huseyin C; Sukumaran, Vijayakumar; Al-Ruweidi, Mahmoud Khatib A A; Shurbaji, Samar",Int. j. mol. sci.

DESIGN: An outbreak investigation was undertaken among all residents and staff. A screening event involved nose and throat swab samples from residents and staff, examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). An electronic questionnaire regarding risk factors was distributed to staff. RESULTS: 58 residents out of 1,156 (5.0%, 95% CI: 3.8 - 6.3) and 129 staff out of 510 (25.3%, 95% CI: 21.5 - 29.1) displayed COVID-19 symptoms, including six and eight confirmed, respectively. Residents reported cough symptoms with no fever (29.3%), followed by a cough and fever (15.5%). 62.1% of symptomatic residents were 50 years or older, placing them in the group at risk for severe COVID-19 disease. Wing I had the highest attack rate (12.5%). 1,063 individuals were swabbed during the 5-day screening event, and all had negative swab results. CONCLUSION: The findings were consistent with the hypothesis of a propagating outbreak with decreasing incidence since the peak date of onset. COVID-19 transmission within a high-risk setting was quickly contained, and an explosive outbreak was prevented through a multi-agency public health response.","Wilburn, Jennifer; Blakey, Eleanor; Trindall, Amy; Burr, Helen; Tanti, Vince; Doolan, Sue; Palmer, Ian; Jewell, Tony; Balakrishnan, Ravikumar",Int J Infect Dis,347,24

The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to summarize the evidence on clinically relevant outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and medRxiv were searched up to April 20, 2020, for studies including hospitalized symptomatic adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The secondary outcomes included acute cardiac or kidney injury, shock, coagulopathy, and venous thromboembolism. The main analysis was based on data from peer-reviewed studies. Summary estimates and the corresponding 95% prediction intervals (PIs) were obtained through meta-analyses. RESULTS: A total of 44 peer-reviewed studies with 14,866 COVID-19 patients were included. In general, risk of bias was high. All-cause mortality was 10% overall (95% PI, 2 to 39%; 1687/14203 patients; 43 studies), 34% in patients admitted to intensive care units (95% PI, 8 to 76%; 659/2368 patients; 10 studies), 83% in patients requiring invasive ventilation (95% PI, 1 to 100%; 180/220 patients; 6 studies), and 75% in patients who developed ARDS (95% PI, 35 to 94%; 339/455 patients; 11 studies). On average, ARDS occurred in 14% of patients (95% PI, 2 to 59%; 999/6322 patients; 23 studies), acute cardiac injury in 15% (95% PI, 5 to 38%; 452/2389 patients; 10 studies), venous thromboembolism in 15% (95% PI, 0 to 100%; patients; 3 studies), acute kidney injury in 6% (95% PI, 1 to 41%; 318/4682 patients; 15 studies), coagulopathy in 6% (95% PI, 1 to 39%; 223/3370 patients; 9 studies), and shock in 3% (95% PI, 0 to 61%; 203/4309 patients; 13 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality was very high in critically ill patients based on very low-quality evidence due to striking heterogeneity and risk of bias. The incidence of clinically relevant outcomes was substantial, although reported by only one third of the studies suggesting considerable underreporting.

While these seasonal trends are established in influenza and human coronaviruses, the mechanisms driving the variation remain poorly understood and thus difficult to extend to similar viruses like SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we use the Quadrature-based model of Respiratory Aerosol and Droplets (QuaRAD) to explore the sensitivity of airborne transmission to the seasonal variation in indoor relative humidity across the wide range of relevant conditions, using SARS-CoV-2 as an example. Relative humidity impacts the evaporation rate and equilibrium size of airborne particles, which in turn may impact particle removal rates and virion viability. Across a large ensemble of scenarios, we found that the dry indoor conditions typical of the winter season lead to slower inactivation than in the more humid summer season; in poorly ventilated spaces, this reduction in inactivation rates increases the concentration of active virions, but this effect was important when the susceptible person was farther than 2 m downwind of the infectious person. On the other hand, changes in particle settling velocity with relative humidity did not significantly affect the removal or travel distance of virus-laden scenarios.","Robey, Alison; Fierce, Laura",,347,16

On January 7, 2020, Chinese health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was associated with this initial cluster (1). As of February 4, 2020, a total of 20,471 confirmed cases, including 2,788 (13.6%) with severe illness,* and 425 deaths (2.1%) had been reported by the National Health Commission of China (2). Cases have also been reported in 26 locations outside of mainland China, including documentation of some person-to-person transmission and one death (2). As of February 4, 11 cases had been reported in the United States. On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On January 31, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary declared a U.S. public health emergency to respond to 2019-nCoV.§ Also on January 31, the president of the United States signed a ""Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus,"" which limits entry into the United States of persons who traveled to mainland China to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents and their families (3). CDC, multiple other federal agencies, state and local health departments, and other partners are implementing aggressive measures to slow transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States (4,5). These measures require the identification of cases and their contacts in the United States and the appropriate assessment and care of travelers arriving from mainland China to the United States. These measures are being implemented in anticipation of additional 2019-nCoV cases in the United States. Although these measures might not prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing, widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare health care systems and the general public to be ready if widespread transmission with substantial associated illness occurs; and 3) better characterize 2019-nCoV infection to guide public health recommendations and the development of medical countermeasures including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely. As more is learned about this novel virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by CDC and state and local health departments.","Patel, Anita; Jernigan, Daniel B",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,347,6

With the widespread cancellations of clinical and academic activities, educators are looking to technological advancements to help 'bridge the gap' and continue medical education. SOLUTIONS: Simulation-based training as the 'gold standard' for medical education has limitations that prevent widespread adoption outside suitably resourced centres. Virtual reality has the potential to surmount these barriers, whilst fulfilling the fundamental aim of simulation-based training to provide a safe, effective and realistic learning environment. CURRENT LIMITATIONS AND INSIGHTS FOR FUTURE: The main limitations of virtual reality technology include comfort and the restrictive power of mobile processors. There exists a clear developmental path to address these restrictions. Continued developments of the hardware and software set to deepen immersion and widen the possibilities within surgical education. CONCLUSION: In the post coronavirus disease 2019 educational landscape, virtual, augmented and mixed reality technology may prove invaluable in the training of the next generation of surgeons.","Abbas, J R; Kenth, J J; Bruce, I A",J Laryngol Otol,347,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS Seventy-four patients with COVID-19 were prospectively followed for longitudinal assessment of somatic symptom burden and sleep quality. We used the 8-item Somatic Symptom Scale (SSS-8) and the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale for somatic symptom burden and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for sleep quality investigation. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent factors associated with somatic symptom burden and sleep quality. RESULTS Although the degree of physical discomfort and sleep quality issues tended to decline during self-quarantine, patients still experienced these problems to a certain degree. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that SSS-8 scores at admission (relative risk [RR] 1.234, 95% CI 1.075-1.417, P=0.003) and mMRC scores at discharge (RR 2.420, 95% CI 1.251-4.682, P=0.009) were 2 independent prognostic indicators of somatic symptom burden. In addition, muscle pain as a chief complaint (RR 4.682, 95% CI 1.247-17.580, P<0.022) and history of use of hypnotic drugs (RR 0.148, 95% CI 0.029-0.749, P<0.019) were 2 independent indicators of patient sleep quality during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first dynamic assessment of the somatic symptom burden and sleep quality in patients with COVID-19 during hospitalization and quarantine after discharge. Patients with high somatic symptom burden at admission, especially muscle pain as the chief complaint, are prone to having a higher physical burden and more sleep disturbance at discharge.","Huang, Shujie; Zhuang, Weitao; Wang, Dongya; Zha, Lulu; Xu, Xi; Li, Xiangdong; Shi, Qiuling; Wang, Xin Shelley; Qiao, Guibin",Med Sci Monit,347,16

In this study, the therapeutic potential of a new iridoid glycoside isolated from the leaves of Clerodendrum volubile against COVID-19 was investigated. Harpagide 5-O-ß-D-glucopyranoside (HG) was isolated, characterised and investigated for its druglikeness, optimized geometry, and pharmacokinetics properties. Its immunomodulatory was determined by chemiluminescence assay using polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in addition to T-cell proliferation assay. In silico analysis was used in determining its molecular interaction with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2). HG displayed potent druglikeness properties, with no inhibitory effect on cytochrome P450 (1A2, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4) and a predicted LD50 of 2000 mg/kg. Its 1H-NMR chemical shifts showed a little deviation of 0.01 and 0.11 ppm for H-4 and H-9, respectively. HG significantly suppressed oxidative bursts in PMNs, while concomitantly inhibiting T-cell proliferation. It also displayed a very strong binding affinity with the translation initiation and termination sequence sites of spike (S) protein mRNA of SARS-COV-2, its gene product, and host ACE2 receptor. These results suggest the immunomodulatory properties and anti-SARS-COV-2 potentials of HG which can be explored in the treatment and management of COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The 45S and 5S rRNA genes are independent and localized at one or more loci per the chromosome complement, their positions along chromosomes offer useful markers for chromosome discriminations. In the current study FISH has been performed to locate 45S and 5S rRNA genes on the chromosomes of nine Lathyrus species belong to five different sections, all have chromosome number 2n=14, Lathyrus gorgoni Parl, Lathyrus hirsutus L., Lathyrus amphicarpos L., Lathyrus odoratus L., Lathyrus sphaericus Retz, Lathyrus incospicuus L, Lathyrus paranensis Burkart, Lathyrus nissolia L., and Lathyrus articulates L. RESULTS: The revealed loci of 45S and 5S rDNA by FISH on metaphase chromosomes of the examined species were as follow: all of the studied species have one 45S rDNA locus and one 5S rDNA locus except L. odoratus L., L. amphicarpos L. and L. sphaericus Retz L. have two loci of 5S rDNA. Three out of the nine examined species have the loci of 45S and 5S rRNA genes on the opposite arms of the same chromosome (L. nissolia L., L. amphicarpos L., and L. incospicuus L.), while L. hirsutus L. has both loci on the same chromosome arm. The other five species showed the loci of the two types of rDNA on different chromosomes. CONCLUSION: The detected 5S and 45S rDNA loci in Lathyrus could be used as chromosomal markers to discriminate the chromosome pairs of the examined species. FISH could discriminate only one chromosome pair out of the seven pairs in three species, in L. hirsutus L., L. nissolia L. and L. incospicuus L., and two chromosome pairs in five species, in L. paranensis Burkart, L. odoratus L., L. amphicarpos L., L. gorgoni Parl. and L. articulatus L., while it could discriminate three chromosome pairs in L. sphaericus Retz. these results could contribute into the physical genome mapping of Lathyrus species and the evolution of rDNA patterns by FISH in the coming studies in future.","Ali, Hoda B M; Osman, Samira A",J Genet Eng Biotechnol,347,20

We aimed to determine whether abnormal liver biochemistry, assessed at baseline and at repeat measures over time, was associated with death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 compared to those without COVID-19, in a UK population. Approach & Results: We extracted routinely collected clinical data from a large teaching hospital in the UK, matching 585 hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients to 1165 hospitalised RT-PCR-negative patients for age, gender, ethnicity and pre-existing comorbidities. 26.8% (157/585) of COVID-19 patients died, compared to 11.9% (139/1165) in the non-COVID-19 group (p<0.001). At presentation, a significantly higher proportion of the COVID-19 group had elevated alanine aminotransferase (20.7% vs. 14.6%, p=0.004) and hypoalbuminaemia (58.7% vs. 35.0%, p<0.001), compared to the non-COVID-19 group. Within the COVID-19 group, those with hypoalbuminaemia at presentation had 1.83-fold increased hazards of death compared to those with normal albumin (adjusted HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.25-2.67), whilst the hazard of death was ~4-fold higher in those aged &#8805;75 years (adjusted HR 3.96, 95% CI 2.59-6.04) and ~3-fold higher in those with pre-existing liver disease (adjusted HR 3.37, 95% CI 1.58-7.16). In the COVID-19 group, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increased (R=0.192, p<0.0001) and albumin declined (R=-0.123, p=0.0004) over time in patients who died. Conclusion: In this UK population, liver biochemistry is commonly deranged in patients with COVID-19. Baseline hypoalbuminaemia and rising ALP over time could be prognostic markers for death but investigation of larger cohorts is required to develop a better understanding of the relationship between liver biochemistry and disease outcome.","Wang, Tingyan; Smith, David A; Campbell, Cori; Harris, Steve; Salih, Hizni; Várnai, Kinga A; Woods, Kerrie; Noble, Theresa; Freeman, Oliver; Moysova, Zuzana; Marjot, Thomas; Webb, Gwilym J; Davies, Jim; Barnes, Eleanor; Matthews, Philippa C",,347,22

national higher education, distancing of learning and research processes require urgent communicative reloa ing of libraries The purpose of the article: a) definition and characteristics of the organization of remotely working teams (teams) of libraries of higher education institutions at the stage of transfer of library teams to remote work;b) identification of approaches that already take place in Ukraine in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic The author has investigated the administrative aspect of the initial stage of the organization of the transfer of higher education libraries of Ukraine to remote work in the first 2 months (13 03â€“13 05 2020) of the introduction of quarantine in connection with the pandemic COVID-19 A thorough analysis of professional literature, sites of libraries and library associations, social networks, and self-reflection of the authorâ€™s own experience as a director of the university library during the pandemic has been carried out Interviews (April 22â€“24, 2020) with 8 directors of higher education libraries of Ukraine were conducted in order to better understand the organizational aspects of the need for rapid transfer of employees to remote work An online survey among 63 heads and leading specialists of higher education libraries of Ukraine on the topic â€œModels of remote work of university library teams in conditions of uncertaintyâ€ (May 25â€“31, 2020) was conducted The priority actions of the library management and stages of these actions at the transfer of library collectives to remote work are defined Four

Although reopening K-12 schools for in-person schooling is desirable for many reasons, officials understand that risk reduction strategies and detection of cases are imperative in creating a safe return to school. Furthermore, consequences of reclosing recently opened schools are substantial and impact teachers, parents, and ultimately educational experiences in children. To address competing interests in meeting educational needs with public safety, we compare the impact of physical separation through school cohorts on SARS-CoV-2 infections against policies acting at the level of individual contacts within classrooms. Using an age-stratified Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed model, we explore influences of reduced class density, transmission mitigation, and viral detection on cumulative prevalence. We consider several scenarios over a 6-month period including (1) multiple rotating cohorts in which students cycle through in-person instruction on a weekly basis, (2) parallel cohorts with in-person and remote learning tracks, (3) the impact of a hypothetical testing program with ideal and imperfect detection, and (4) varying levels of aggregate transmission reduction. Our mathematical model predicts that reducing the number of contacts through cohorts produces a larger effect than diminishing transmission rates per contact. Specifically, the latter approach requires dramatic reduction in transmission rates in order to achieve a comparable effect in minimizing infections over time. Further, our model indicates that surveillance programs using less sensitive tests may be adequate in monitoring infections within a school community by both keeping infections low and allowing for a longer period of instruction. Lastly, we underscore the importance of factoring infection prevalence in deciding when a local outbreak of infection is serious enough to require reverting to remote learning.","Landeros, Alfonso; Ji, Xiang; Lange, Kenneth; Stutz, Timothy C; Xu, Jason; Sehl, Mary E; Sinsheimer, Janet S",PLoS One,347,16

The small â¼30-kb ssRNA genome of coronaviruses makes them adept at cross-species spread while enabling a robust understanding of all of the proteins the viral genome encodes. We have employed protein modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, evolutionary mapping, and 3D printing to gain a full proteome- and dynamicome-level understanding of SARS-CoV-2. We established the Viral Integrated Structural Evolution Dynamic Database (VIStEDD at RRID:SCR_018793) to facilitate future discoveries and educational use. Here, we highlight the use of VIStEDD for nsp6, nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) surface glycoprotein. For both nsp6 and N, we found highly conserved surface amino acids that likely drive protein-protein interactions. In characterizing viral S protein, we developed a quantitative dynamics cross-correlation matrix to gain insights into its interactions with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-solute carrier family 6 member 19 (SLC6A19) dimer. Using this quantitative matrix, we elucidated 47 potential functional missense variants from genomic databases within ACE2/SLC6A19/transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), warranting genomic enrichment analyses in SARS-CoV-2 patients. These variants had ultralow frequency but existed in males hemizygous for ACE2. Two ACE2 noncoding variants (rs4646118 and rs143185769) present in â¼9% of individuals of African descent may regulate ACE2 expression and may be associated with increased susceptibility of African Americans to SARS-CoV-2. We propose that this SARS-CoV-2 database may aid research into the ongoing pandemic.","Gupta, Ruchir; Charron, Jacob; Stenger, Cynthia L; Painter, Jared; Steward, Hunter; Cook, Taylor W; Faber, William; Frisch, Austin; Lind, Eric; Bauss, Jacob; Li, Xiaopeng; Sirpilla, Olivia; Soehnlen, Xavier; Underwood, Adam; Hinds, David; Morris, Michele; Lamb, Neil; Carcillo, Joseph A; Bupp, Caleb; Uhal, Bruce D; Rajasekaran, Surender; Prokop, Jeremy W",J Biol Chem,347,10

Pandemic scenarios, such as the current one (COVID-19), call for a reduction of face-to-face meetings, especially for elderly patients. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the innovative concept of applying telemedical assessment to geriatric patients in the emergency department (ED) with ED standard treatment. The therapeutic recommendations regarding drug management from the two assessments were compared. A special focus was the use of potentially inadequate drugs (PIMs) for geriatric patients according to the &ldquo;Fit for the Aged&rdquo; (FORTA) classification. METHODS: 50 patients (40% female) aged &ge;70 years and assessed with an Identification of Seniors at Risk Score (ISAR score) of &ge;2 admitted to the ED were prospectively enrolled in this study between November 2017 and February 2018. In addition to the standard treatment in the ED, co-evaluation via video transmission was independently carried out by a board-certified geriatrician. Drug recommendations by ED physicians (A) and the geriatrician (B) were compared. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher frequency of recommendations regarding changes to preexisting medication (p &lt;0.001, n = 50) via geriatric telemedicine in comparison with standard ED treatment. The geriatrician intervened significantly more often than the ED physicians: discontinuation of a drug, p &lt;0.001; start of a new drug, p = 0.004; dose change of a drug, p = 0.001; n = 50). Based on the additional therapy recommendations of the geriatrician, the amount of medication taken by the patient was significantly reduced compared with standard ED treatment (ED assessment t(49) = 0.622 vs geriatrician&rsquo;s assessment t(49) = 4.165; p &lt;0.001; n = 50). Additionally, the number of PIMs was significantly reduced compared with standard medical treatment (p &lt;0.001). The geriatrician changed 53.9% of the drugs (35/65) whereas the ED physicians changed only 12.3% (8/65). Recommendations for immediate drug therapy, however, were made more frequently by ED physicians (p &lt;0.039, n = 50). DISCUSSION: An early assessment of elderly emergency patients by a geriatrician had a significant impact on the number of drug interventions in the ED. The number of PIMs could be significantly reduced. Whether this also has a positive effect on the further inpatient course needs to be investigated in further prospective studies. The study was retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04148027). &nbsp.","Matz, Oliver; Villa, Luigi; Lecce, Chiara; Olaciregui Dague, Karmele; Haeger, Alexa; Bollheimer, Leo Cornelius; Laurentius, Thea; Rossaint, Rolf; Brokmann, Jörg",Swiss Med Wkly,347,20

Using different cohorts of samples collected before and after the pandemic, we show that this assay is more sensitive than ELISAs performed in our laboratory. The combination of three viral antigens allows for the interrogation of full seroconversion. Importantly, we have detected N-reactive antibodies in COVID-19-negative individuals.

Ceftriaxone (CEF) upregulates astrocytic GLT-1 expression/activity, which could counteract excessive glutamate levels and aggressive behavior induced by anabolic synthetic steroids such as nandrolone decanoate (ND). Here, adult male CF-1 mice were allocated to oil (VEH), ND, CEF, and ND/CEF groups. Mice were subcutaneously (s.c.) injected with ND (15â¯mg/kg) or VEH for 19â¯days, and received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of CEF (200â¯mg/kg) or saline for 5â¯days. The ND/CEF group received ND for 19â¯days plus coadministration of CEF in the last 5â¯days. On the 19th day, the aggressive phenotypes were evaluated through the resident-intruder test. After 24â¯h, cerebrospinal fluid was collected to measure glutamate levels, and the pre-frontal cortex was used to assess GLT-1, pGluN2BTyr1472, and pGluN2ATyr1246 by Western blot. Synaptosomes from the left brain hemisphere was used to evaluate mitochondrial function including complex II-succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), Ca2+ handling, membrane potential (&#916;Ñ°m), and H2O2 production. ND decreased the latency for the first attack and number of attacks by the resident mice against the intruder, mechanistically associated with an increase in glutamate and pGluN2BTyr1472 but not pGluN2ATyr1244 and GLT-1 downregulation. The abnormalities in mitochondrial Ca2+ influx, SDH, &#916;Ñ°m, and H2O2 implies in deficient energy support to the synaptic machinery. The ND/CEF group displayed a decreased aggressive behavior, normalization of glutamate and pGluN2BTyr1472levels, and mitochondrial function at synaptic terminals. In conclusion, the pharmacological modulation of GLT-1 highlights its relevance as an astrocytic target against highly impulsive and aggressive phenotypes.","Rodolphi, Marcelo S; Kopczynski, Afonso; Carteri, Randhall B K; Sartor, Monia; Fontella, Fernanda U; Feldmann, Marceli; Hansel, Gisele; Strogulski, Nathan R; Portela, Luis V",Horm Behav,347,20

Professional soccer players were confined to home for 8 weeks and then a retraining period of 4 weeks was set before the first competitive match. When competition was resumed, professional soccer teams competed in a congested calendar (11 matchdays in 39 days) while some in-game regulations were altered (up to 5 substitutions, refreshment pauses). The current research presents an analysis of running patterns before suspension and after resumption of LaLiga to determine how the lockdown affected players' physical performance. To aid in this purpose, a pairwise comparison was performed of running patterns of the 2019-2020 vs. 2018-2019 season (i.e., control season). Using a two-way ANOVA (season x matchday), it was found that there was no main effect of the season on total running distance per match (P = 0.288) nor in the distances covered &lt; 14.0 km/h (P = 0.294), at 21.0-23.9 km/h (P = 0.266), and at &gt;= 24.0 km/h (P = 0.112). Only the distance at 14.0-20.9 km/h was affected by the season (P = 0.019) with a lower running distance on matchday 34 in the 2019-2020 vs. 2018-2019 season. The number of substitutions (from 2.9 to 4.5 substitutions per game;P &lt; 0.001) and match duration (96 vs. 100 min;P &lt; 0.001) significantly increased after resumption respect to the previous season. These data suggest that high-intensity running performance of professional soccer teams was maintained after the resumption of the competition while the alterations likely aided in the in-game regulations facilitated the maintenance of soccer physical performance.","Brito de Souza, D.; Lopez-Del Campo, R.; Resta, R.; Moreno-Perez, V.; Del Coso, J.",Frontiers in Physiology,347,1

Amid concerns about the suspension of drug development due to delays within IRBs, it has been suggested that IRB meetings should be temporarily conducted via the internet. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elucidate the current status of IRB meetings conducted through web conference systems. METHODS: A survey on conducting IRB meetings through web conference systems was administered to Japanese national university hospitals. Respondents were in charge of operating IRB offices at different universities. This study was not a randomized controlled trial. RESULTS: The survey was performed at 42 facilities between the end of May and early June, 2020, immediately after the state of emergency was lifted in Japan. The survey yielded a response rate of 74% (31/42). Additionally, while 68% (21/31) of facilities introduced web conference systems for IRB meetings, 13% (4/31) of the surveyed facilities postponed IRB meetings. Therefore, we conducted a further survey of 21 facilities that implemented web conference systems for IRB meetings. According to 71% (15/21) of the respondents, there was no financial burden for implementing these systems, as they were free of charge. In 90% (19/21) of the facilities, IRB meetings through web conference systems were already being conducted with personal electronic devices. Furthermore, in 48% (10/21) of facilities, a web conference system was used in conjunction with face-to-face meetings. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of reviews in clinical trial core hospitals has decreased. This suggests that the development of pharmaceuticals has stagnated because of COVID-19. According to 71% (15/21) of the respondents who conducted IRB meetings through web conference systems, the cost of introducing such meetings was US $0, showing a negligible financial burden. Moreover, it was shown that online deliberations could be carried out in the same manner as face-to-face meetings, as 86% (18/21) of facilities stated that the number of comments made by board members did not change. To improve the quality of IRB meetings conducted through web conference systems, it is necessary to further examine camera use and the content displayed on members' screens during meetings. Further examination of all members who use web conference systems is required. Our measures for addressing the requests and problems identified in our study could potentially be considered protocols for future IRB meetings, when the COVID-19 pandemic has passed and face-to-face meetings are possible again. This study also highlights the importance of developing web conference systems for IRB meetings to respond to future unforeseen pandemics.","Yagi, Kenta; Maeda, Kazuki; Sakaguchi, Satoshi; Chuma, Masayuki; Sato, Yasutaka; Kane, Chikako; Akaishi, Akiyo; Ishizawa, Keisuke; Yanagawa, Hiroaki",J Med Internet Res,347,15

Results showed that the double-strand primer relatively exhibits a wide annealing temperature range and good compatibility between three pairs of primers and probes. These merits allow the simple and multiplex real-time fluorescence quantification of nucleic acids. The detection limit was 400 copies/mL, and the detection time was approximately 2 h. In addition to its extreme specificity and simplicity, this method has a wide range of applications such as multiple PCR and SNP detection.","Zhang, Zhang; Yao, Juan; Huang, Xiaoling; Zhang, Li; Wang, Ting; Weng, Zhi; Xie, Guoming",Anal Methods,347,16

This patient had a significant, deliberate delay in time to surgical intervention because of his critical state. When deciding the optimal timing for total hip arthroplasty in patients with COVID-19, we recommend using inflammatory markers, such as procalcitonin and interleukin-6, as indicators of disease resolution and caution operative intervention when patients are nearing the 7-10th day of COVID-19 symptoms. Furthermore, implant cementation and spinal anesthesia in critically ill COVID-positive patients should be approached cautiously in the setting of pulmonary disease and multiorgan system failure.

This pioneering study on NR in Filipino adults was conducted to achieve two aims (1) assess the psychometric properties of the Filipino adapted National Resilience Scale (NRS-Filipino) and (2) determine demographic and psychological variables that influence NR. Data from 401 participants yielded an exploratory factor analysis with a good model fit for a four-factor solution that is similar to the original National Resilience Assessment Scale.

METHODS: We evaluated total HCQ concentrations in serum and plasma from published literature values, frozen serum samples from a pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus trial, and simulated concentrations using a published pharmacokinetic model during pregnancy. For each source, we compared observed or predicted HCQ concentrations to target concentrations with reported antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The average total serum/plasma HCQ concentrations were below the lowest SARS-CoV-2 target of 0.48 mg/l in all studies. Assuming the highest antiviral target exposure (total plasma concentration of 4.1 mg/l), all studies had about one-tenth the necessary concentration for in vitro viral inhibition. Pharmacokinetic model simulations confirmed that pregnant adults receiving common dosing for rheumatic diseases did not achieve target exposures; however, the models predict that a dosage of 600 mg once a day during pregnancy would obtain the lowest median target exposure for most patients after the first dose. CONCLUSION: We found that the average patient receiving treatment with HCQ for rheumatic diseases, including children and non-pregnant/pregnant adults, are unlikely to achieve total serum or plasma concentrations shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Nevertheless, patients receiving HCQ long term may have tissue concentrations far exceeding that of serum/plasma. Because the therapeutic window for HCQ in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown, well-designed clinical trials that include patients with rheumatic disease are urgently needed to characterize the efficacy, safety, and target exposures for HCQ.","Balevic, Stephen J; Hornik, Christoph P; Green, Thomas P; Clowse, Megan E B; Gonzalez, Daniel; Maharaj, Anil R; Schanberg, Laura E; Eudy, Amanda M; Swamy, Geeta K; Hughes, Brenna L; Cohen-Wolkowiez, Michael",J. rheumatol,347,26

Of the currently known SARS-CoV-2 clades, clade GR was the most prevalent worldwide followed by GV then GH. Chronological analysis revealed expansion in SARS-CoV-2 clades carrying D614G mutations with the predominance of the newest clade, GV, in the last three months. D614G clades prevail in countries with more COVID-19 cases. Of them, the clades GH and GR were more frequently recovered from severe or deceased COVID-19 cases.

METHODS: The survey was conducted among the members of the ISOLS (International Society of Limb Salvage) and the EMSOS (European Musculo-Skeletal Oncology Society). The survey consisted of 20 questions (single, multiple-response, ranked): origin and surgical experience of the participant (four questions), potential disruption of healthcare (12 questions), and influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the particular physician (four questions). A matrix with four different response options was created for the particular surgical procedures). RESULTS: One hundred forty-nine physicians from five continents completed the survey. Of the respondents, 20.1% and 20.7% stated that surgery for life-threatening sarcomas were stopped or delayed, respectively. Even when the malignancy was expected to involve infiltration of a neurovascular bundle or fracture of a bone, still 13.8% and 14.7% of the respondents, respectively, stated that surgery was not performed. In cases of pending fractures of bone tumors, 37.5 to 46.2% of operations were canceled. CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic caused a significant reduction in healthcare (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) for malignancies of the musculoskeletal system. Delaying or stopping these treatments is life-threatening or can cause severe morbidity, pain, and loss of function. Although the coronavirus disease causes severe medical complications, serious collateral damage including death due to delayed or untreated sarcomas should be avoided.","Thaler, Martin; Khosravi, Ismail; Leithner, Andreas; Papagelopoulos, Panayiotis J; Ruggieri, Pietro",Int Orthop,347,30

We conducted a needs assessment of how Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities address and manage disposal of unused opioid medications to identify opportunities for improvement. METHODS: We used rapid qualitative content analysis methods with team consensus to synthesize findings. Data were collected in 2 waves: (1) semistructured interviews with 19 providers in October 2019 and (2) structured questions to 21 providers in March to April of 2020 addressing how coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) changed disposal priorities. RESULTS: While many diverse strategies have been tried in the VA, we found limited standardization of advice on opioid disposal and practices nationally. Providers offered the following recommendations: target specific patient scenarios for enhanced disposal efforts, emphasize mail-back envelopes, keep recommendations to providers and patients consistent and reinforce existing guidance, explore virtual modalities to monitor disposal activity, prioritize access to viable disposal strategies, and transition from pull to push communication. These themes were identified in the fall of 2019 and remained salient in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: A centralized VA national approach could include proactive communication with patients and providers, interventions tailored to specific settings and populations, and facilitated access to disposal options. All of the above strategies are feasible in the context of an extended period of social distancing.","Giannitrapani, Karleen F; Brown-Johnson, Cati; McCaa, Matthew; Mckelvey, Jeremiah; Glassman, Peter; Holliday, Jesse; Sandbrink, Friedhelm; Lorenz, Karl A",Am J Health Syst Pharm,347,24

R0 for India was estimated to be 2·08 while the Rt decreased from 1·67 on 30 March to 1·16 on 22 April. We observed that the delay from date of lockdown relaxation to start of second wave increases as lockdown is extended farther after the first wave peak- this delay is longer if lockdown is relaxed gradually. Aggressive measures like lockdowns may be inherently enough to suppress an outbreak, however other measures need to be scaled up as lockdowns are relaxed. Lower levels of social distancing when coupled with a testing ramp-up, could achieve similar outbreak control as an aggressive social distancing regime where testing was not increased.","Gupta, Mohak; Mohanta, Saptarshi Soham; Rao, Aditi; Parameswaran, Giridara Gopal; Agarwal, Mudit; Arora, Mehak; Mazumder, Archisman; Lohiya, Ayush; Behera, Priyamadhaba; Bansal, Agam; Kumar, Rohit; Meena, Ved Prakash; Tiwari, Pawan; Mohan, Anant; Bhatnagar, Sushma",Int. j. infect. dis,347,10

Locales in which efforts were undertaken to encourage distancing experienced reductions in their rate of transmission. However, these aggregate results tell us little about the effectiveness of social distancing at the level of the individual, which is the question addressed by the current research. Four months after participating in a study assessing their social distancing behavior, 2,120 participants indicated whether they had contracted COVID-19. Importantly, the assessment of social distancing involved not only a self-report measure of how strictly participants had followed social distancing recommendations but also a series of virtual behavior measures of social distancing. These simulations presented participants with graphical depictions mirroring specific real-world scenarios, asking them to position themselves in relation to others in the scene. Individuals' social distancing behavior, particularly as assessed by the virtual behavior measure, predicted whether they contracted COVID-19 during the intervening 4 mo. This was true when considering only participants who reported having tested positively for the virus and when considering additional participants who, although untested, believed that they had contracted the virus. The findings offer a unique form of additional evidence as to why individuals should practice social distancing.

Toxic effects of PHE to earthworms have been extensively studied, but toxic mechanisms on PHE-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress at the molecular and cellular levels have not been reported yet. Therefore, we explored the cytotoxicity and oxidative stress caused by PHE in earthworm coelomocytes and the interaction mechanism between PHE and the major antioxidant enzymes SOD/CAT. It was shown that high-dose PHE exposure induced the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mediated lipid peroxidation, reduced total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in coelomocytes, and triggered oxidative stress, thus resulted in a strong cytotoxicity at higher concentrations (0.6-1.0 mg/L). The intracellular SOD/CAT activity in cells after PHE exposure were congruent with that in molecular levels, which the activity of SOD enhanced and CAT inhibited. Spectroscopic studies showed the SOD/CAT protein skeleton and secondary structure, as well as the micro-environment of aromatic amino acids were changed after PHE binding. Molecular docking indicated PHE preferentially docked to the surface of SOD. However, the key residues Tyr 357, His 74, and Asn 147 for activity were in the binding pocket, indicating PHE more likely to dock to the active center of CAT. In addition, H-bonding and hydrophobic force were the primary driving force in the binding interaction between PHE and SOD/CAT. This study indicates that PHE can induce cytotoxicity and oxidative damage to coelomocytes and unearthes the potential effects of PHE on earthworms.","He, Falin; Liu, Qiang; Jing, Mingyang; Wan, Jingqiang; Huo, Chengqian; Zong, Wansong; Tang, Jingchun; Liu, Rutao",J Hazard Mater,347,21

AC is a low-immunogenic derivative of collagen obtained by the removal of N- and C-terminal telopeptide components. Mixed solutions of negatively charged SiNPs and AC were turbid, while positively charged SiNPs (Ludox CL) did not form a complex with AC in pH 4 buffer, indicating that electrostatic attraction is the dominant force to form the complex. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and circular dichroism (CD) measurements were made for AC and Ludox LS (or CL) solutions in acetate buffer (pH 4.0) and citrate buffer (pH 3.0). The CD data showed that the stability of the triple helical structure of AC in the buffers is not affected by the complexation. The resulting complex consisting of triple helical AC and SiNPs did not influence the SAXS profile except for the lowest q region investigated. On the contrary, different scattering profiles were observed for the single chain AC and SiNP mixture indicating densely packed SiNPs in the complex. This scattering behavior was fairly explained in terms of the sticky hard sphere model (SHSM). This AC conformation-dependent complexation may be because of the hydrogen bonding interaction between the single chain AC and SiNPs.

METHODS: From mid-January to March 2020, we extracted publicly available data regarding the spread and control of COVID-19 from 31 provincial health authorities and major media outlets in mainland China. Based on these data, we conducted descriptive analyses of the epidemic in the six most-affected provinces. RESULTS: School closures, travel restrictions, community-level lockdown, and contact tracing were introduced concurrently around late January but subsequent epidemic trends differed among provinces. Compared with Hubei, the other five most-affected provinces reported a lower crude case fatality ratio and proportion of critical and severe hospitalised cases. From March 2020, as the local transmission of COVID-19 declined, switching the focus of measures to the testing and quarantine of inbound travellers may have helped to sustain the control of the epidemic.

A publicly available database containing these indicators and information regarding control measures is a useful resource for further research and policy planning in response to the COVID-19 epidemic.","Fu, Han; Wang, Haowei; Xi, Xiaoyue; Boonyasiri, Adhiratha; Wang, Yuanrong; Hinsley, Wes; Fraser, Keith J; McCabe, Ruth; Olivera Mesa, Daniela; Skarp, Janetta; Ledda, Alice; Dewé, Tamsin; Dighe, Amy; Winskill, Peter; van Elsland, Sabine L; Ainslie, Kylie E C; Baguelin, Marc; Bhatt, Samir; Boyd, Olivia; Brazeau, Nicholas F; Cattarino, Lorenzo; Charles, Giovanni; Coupland, Helen; Cucunuba, Zulma M; Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina; Donnelly, Christl A; Dorigatti, Ilaria; Eales, Oliver D; FitzJohn, Richard G; Flaxman, Seth; Gaythorpe, Katy A M; Ghani, Azra C; Green, William D; Hamlet, Arran; Hauck, Katharina; Haw, David J; Jeffrey, Benjamin; Laydon, Daniel J; Lees, John A; Mellan, Thomas; Mishra, Swapnil; Nedjati-Gilani, Gemma; Nouvellet, Pierre; Okell, Lucy; Parag, Kris V; Ragonnet-Cronin, Manon; Riley, Steven; Schmit, Nora; Thompson, Hayley A; Unwin, H Juliette T",Int J Infect Dis,347,25

The role of microvascular dysfunction on MACE beyond traditional risk indicators and inflammation is not well established. We examined whether peripheral microvascular dysfunction is associated with MACE in patients with CAD. Approach and Results: Microvascular function was measured with the Reactive Hyperemia Index (RHI) using digital peripheral arterial tonometry in 546 patients with CAD, who were followed 7 years for incident MACE. The primary end point included cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction; the secondary end point included cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or heart failure hospitalization. Hazard models for competing risk were used to estimate the association between RHI and MACE adjusting for age, sex, race, traditional risk factors, medications, and CAD severity. We also examined the association of baseline interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and matrix metallopeptidase-9 with RHI. Mean age was 62±9 years. Mean RHI was 2.1±0.63. After adjustment, for each 1-SD decrease in RHI, there was a 40% increase in the primary end point (hazard ratio, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1-1.9], P=0.01) and a similar increase in the secondary end point (HR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1-1.7], P=0.006). Inflammatory biomarker levels were associated with greater RHI impairment (P<0.05) but did not affect the relationship between RHI and MACE. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral microvascular dysfunction is associated with increased risk of MACE in patients with stable CAD, implicating the role of microvascular disease in the pathogenesis of adverse outcomes in patients with CAD.","Young, An; Garcia, Mariana; Sullivan, Samaah M; Liu, Chang; Moazzami, Kasra; Ko, Yi-An; Shah, Amit; Kim, Jeong Hwan; Pearce, Brad; Uphoff, Irina; Bremner, J Douglas; Raggi, Paolo; Quyyumi, Arshed; Vaccarino, Viola",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,347,16

A COVID-19-infected surgeon performed surgical activities before being tested. An exposure risk classification was applied to the identified exposed subjects and high- and medium-risk contacts underwent active symptom monitoring for 14 days at home. All healthcare professionals (HCPs) were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of the quarantine and serological tests were performed. Three household contacts and 20 HCPs were identified as high- or medium-risk contacts and underwent a 14-day quarantine. Fourteen HCPs and 19 patients were instead classified as low risk. All the contacts remained asymptomatic and all HCPs tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. About 25-28 days after their last exposure, HCPs underwent serological testing and two of them had positive IgM but negative confirmatory swabs. In a low COVID-19 burden area, the in-hospital transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an infectious doctor did not occur and, despite multiple and frequent contacts, a hospital outbreak was avoided. This may be linked to the adoption of specific recommendations and to the use of standard personal protective equipment by HCPs.","Gallo, Oreste; Peris, Adriano; Trotta, Michele; Orlando, Pietro; Maggiore, Giandomenico; Cilona, Maria; Trovati, Massimo; Locatello, Luca Giovanni",Epidemiol Infect,347,16

Risk factors for mortality have not been well summarized. Current meta-analysis of retrospective cohort studies was done to summarize available findings on the association between age, gender, comorbidities and risk of death from COVID-19 infection.Methods: Online databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Google scholar were searched to detect relevant publications up to 1 May 2020, using relevant keywords. To pool data, random-effects model was used. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis and publication bias test were also done.Results: In total, 14 studies with 29,909 COVID-19 infected patients and 1445 cases of death were included in the current meta-analysis. Significant associations were found between older age (&#8805;65 vs <65 years old) (pooled ORs = 4.59, 95%CIs = 2.61-8.04, p < .001), gender (male vs female) (pooled ORs = 1.50, 95%CIs = 1.06-2.12, p = .021) and risk of death from COVID-19 infection. In addition, hypertension (pooled ORs = 2.70, 95%CIs = 1.40-5.24, p = .003), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) (pooled ORs = 3.72, 95%CIs = 1.77-7.83, p = .001), diabetes (pooled ORs = 2.41, 95%CIs = 1.05-5.51, p = .037), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (pooled ORs = 3.53, 95%CIs = 1.79-6.96, p < .001) and cancer (pooled ORs = 3.04, 95%CIs = 1.80-5.14, p < .001), were associated with higher risk of mortality.Conclusions: Older age (&#8805;65 years old), male gender, hypertension, CVDs, diabetes, COPD and malignancies were associated with greater risk of death from COVID-19 infection.

The anti-viral activities from several ayurvedic herbal medicines (in the form of crude extract or fraction or isolated compounds) have been established but their effectiveness against coronavirus still needs to be explored. They can provide a rich resource of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates. In this paper, in-silico techniques have been used to identify the potential lead molecules against SARS-CoV-2. A list of flavonoids having anti-viral activity was prepared and evaluated against the selected target. Rhoifolin, 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-ß-d-glucopyranoside, baicalin, astragalin, luteolin, and kaempferol showed good binding affinity and thus these could be promising compounds. In-silico screening such as ADMET prediction has been performed which predicted that the selected flavonoids have good pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties. Molecular dynamics simulation studies and MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations showed luteolin to be a more effective candidate against viral protein Mpro. The novelty of the approach mainly rests in the identification of potent anti-viral natural molecules from natural products flavonoid group of molecules to be effective against the latest coronavirus infection.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Limited real-world data on its effectiveness and safety are available from an Italian population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated long-term clinical data from the single-arm PERsistent Sitagliptin Treatment & Outcomes (PERS&O) study, which collected information on 440 patients with TD2 (275 men, 165 women; mean age 64.1 years; disease median duration: 12 years) treated with sitagliptin 'add-on'. For each patient, we estimated the 10-year cardiovascular (CV) risk using the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Risk Engine (RE). Drug survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves; repeated measures mixed effects models were used to evaluate the evolution of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and CV risk during sitagliptin treatment. RESULTS: At baseline, most patients were overweight or obese (median body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2) 30.2); median HbA1c was 8.4%; median fasting plasma glucose: 172 mg/dL; median UKPDS RE score: 24.8%, being higher in men (median 30.2%) than in women (median 17.0%) as expected. Median follow-up from starting sitagliptin treatment was 5.6 years. From Kaplan-Meier curves, the estimated median drug survival was 32.8 months when considering discontinuation for any cause and 58.4 months when considering discontinuation for loss of efficacy. A significant improvement in HbA1c was evident during treatment with sitagliptin (p<0.01): the reduction was rapid (median HbA1c after 4-6 months: 7.5%) and continued at longer follow-up. When comparing patients treated with sitagliptin versus those stopping sitagliptin and switching to another antihyperglycemic drug, we detected a significant difference in the evolution of HbA1c in favor of patients who continued sitagliptin treatment. The UKPDS RE score at 10 years and the BMI significantly improved during treatment with sitagliptin (p<0.001). Adverse events were relatively uncommon. CONCLUSION: Patients with T2D treated with sitagliptin achieved an improvement in metabolic control and a reduction in CV risk and did not experience relevant adverse events.","Bossi, Antonio Carlo; De Mori, Valentina; Galeone, Carlotta; Bertola, Davide Pietro; Gaiti, Margherita; Balini, Annalisa; Berzi, Denise; Forloni, Franco; Meregalli, Giancarla; Turati, Federica",,347,23

Next, we critically evaluate certain proposed solutions to contain the epidemic based on instantaneous modifications of the reproductive number. Finally, we build increasingly complex and realistic models, ranging from simple homogeneous models used to estimate local reproduction numbers, to fully coupled inhomogeneous (deterministic or stochastic) models incorporating mobility estimates from cell phone location data. The models are capable of producing forecasts highly consistent with the official number of cases with minimal parameter fitting and fine-tuning. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the proposed models, focusing on the validity of different necessary first approximations, and caution future modeling efforts to exercise great care in the interpretation of long-term forecasts, and in the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions backed by numerical simulations.","Tagliazucchi, E.; Balenzuela, P.; Travizano, M.; Mindlin, G.

Clinical experience suggests a lower documented prevalence. This could cause longer admissions and complications, such as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). We carried out a service evaluation to investigate the recognition and management of catatonia on inpatient units in Southern Health Foundation Trust (SHFT). We reviewed the local documented prevalence of catatonia, treatment offered and prevalence of complications.MethodWe retrospectively reviewed the electronic records of 95 consecutive admissions to four adult inpatient units in SHFT, starting on 1st August 2020. We reviewed notes for the admission to establish whether catatonia was suspected and identified. We applied the screening questions from the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) to the documented mental state examinations (MSE) prior to, and shortly after, admission. We also recorded the prescriptions issued during the first 72 hours of admission, and whether patients developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), serotonin syndrome or required admission to a general hospital during admission.ResultCatatonia was documented as a possibility for 2 patients (2.1%). One showed possible posturing and stupor, while there were no documented symptoms for the other. In both cases the possibility was discounted by the clinical team. Twelve patients (12.6%) showed one or more possible or confirmed signs of catatonia. Eleven of these were prescribed regular antipsychotic medication on admission, but only 3 were prescribed regular benzodiazepines. NMS was more likely to be suspected in patients with a BFCRS of 1 or more compared with those with a score of 0, with an odds ratio of 8.1 (95% CI [1.03-64.0], Fisher's exact test = 7.79, p = .076).ConclusionCatatonia is likely under-recognised and under-treated locally among psychiatric inpatients. Although only approaching statistical significance, the higher rate of suspected NMS in patients showing possible catatonia is noteworthy and needs further investigation. Regular benzodiazepines were not frequently prescribed in this group, while antipsychotics, prescribed in all of these patients, can precipitate NMS. Alternatively, this finding could reflect the overlap in clinical presentation between NMS and catatonia. Data collection was limited by the frequent use of “remote clerking”, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the quality of mental state examinations was often not sufficient to draw any conclusions on the possible presence or absence of catatonic symptoms.

Several countries have imposed lockdown and isolation in attempt to mitigate viral spread. However, social isolation has a negative effect on psychological aspects, increasing stress, fear, anxiety, anger and emotional disturbance, as well as affecting sleep pattern and the practice of physical activity. Negative emotions and lifestyle changes trigger overeating, consequently affecting dietary practices. The aim of this study was to verify the prevalence of lifestyle factors (i.e., sleep time/quality and practice of physical exercise), eating behavior dimensions, chronotype, and association with dietary practices (planning, domestic organization, food choice, ways of eating) in home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic in São Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between April 27 and May 25, 2020. An anonymous online questionnaire (Microsoft Forms) was used for data collection by the snowball method. We verified dietary practices (outcome), eating behavior, physical exercise practice, sleep quality and duration, and chronotype (exposure variables). Sex, age, educational and social status were assessed as covariates and confounders. We evaluated 724 adults (585 women and 139 men). Mean age was 32.6 y (±11.3) for women and 33.5 y (±10.5) for men. RESULTS: Emotional eating (EE) and binge eating (BE) were positively correlated (r = 0.66; P <0.001). Dietary practices were negatively correlated with BE (r = -0.41; P <0.001), EE (r = -0.33; P <0.001) and body mass index (r = -0.24; P <0.001). Linear regression demonstrated that EE (ß = -0.1351; t = -2.841; P = 0.005; Î·p2 = 0.013), BE (ß = -0.2580; t = -5.612; P < 0.001; Î·p2 = 0.050), no practice of physical exercise at home (ß = -0.4271; t = -5.933; P < 0.001; Î·p2 = 0.055), being vespertine (ß = -0.3435; t = 2.076; P = 0.038; Î·p2 = 0.019), and age (ß = -0.082; t = -2.210; P = 0.027; Î·p2 = 0.008) are negative predictors of dietary practices. Finally, cognitive restraint (ß = 0.1407; t = 3.858; P < 0.001; Î·p2 = 0.024), better sleep quality (ß = 0.1768; t = 2.506; P = 0.012; Î·p2 = 0.010), receiving 4-10 wages per month (according to a minimum wage in Brazil that corresponds to US $ 183.01) (ß = 0.2568; t = 2.573; P = 0.10; Î·p2 = 0.027) and 10 - 20 wages per month (ß = 0.4490; t = 3.726; P < 0.001; Î·p2 = 0.027) are positive predictors of dietary practices. CONCLUSION: Eating behavior, physical exercise, sleep, and social factors can be important predictors for dietary practices during COVID-19 social confinement. Longitudinal studies in Brazil are needed to confirm these findings.","Dos Santos Quaresma, Marcus Vl; Marques, Camila Guazzelli; Magalhães, Ana Carolina Oumatu; Dos Santos, Ronaldo Vagner Thomatieli",Nutrition,347,20

In this overarching context, governments are faced with making rapid and high-stake decisions dictated by emergency that in a state of normalcy they would not, or could not pursue. Governments tend to gather, therefore, an incredible amount of unchecked power in times of fast-moving ecological crises that raises concerns about where the legitimacy of such excessive power comes from. Moreover, the elected politicians rely on the expert advice in a pandemic. This takes away democratic political authority from the sovereign people and instead places it on allegedly objective unelected experts. In contrast, experts have (1) a dubious reputation in predicting the future and (2) varying degrees of biases and self-interests, which make them susceptible, for instance, to ""framing problems"" in relation to the urgent public issues at stake. This article suggests new ways of thinking about COVID-19 technology policy, drawing from the field of political science and democratic theory. It examines the power-laden tensions between the political authority and the expert authority. Going forward, I highlight the brief history of epistemic democracy, taking into consideration that in advanced modern democracies, political decision making has to draw, in part, from expert knowledge, but without resulting in democratic deficits. The COVID-19 science and technology policy can usefully build on epistemic democracy while strengthening the science, society, and democracy nexus.","Boschele, Marco",OMICS,347,32

The present study assessed possible associations between one-month mortality and demographic data, SpO2, underlying diseases and laboratory findings, in COVID-19 patients. Also, since recent studies on COVID-19, have focused on Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as an independent risk factor of the in-hospital death and a significant prognostic biomarker of outcomes in critically ill patients, in this study, we assessed predictive potential of this factor in terms of one-month mortality. METHODS: Patients admitted to Imam Reza hospital, affiliated to Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran, from March to June 2020, with positive RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2, were included in this study. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard model were used to respectively estimate one-month mortality since admission and determine factors associated with one-month mortality. RESULTS: In this retrospective cohort study, 219 patients were included (137 men and 82 women (mean age 58.2 ± 16 and 57 ± 17.3 years old, respectively)). Hypertension, ischemic heart disease and diabetes were respectively the most common comorbidities. Among these patients, 63 patients were admitted to the ICU and 31 deaths occurred during one-month follow-up. With respect to mean peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), 142 patients had SpO2 &#8804; 90%. Based on our analysis, older age and increased Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and White blood cells (WBC) count were associated with increased risk of one-month mortality. Patients with SpO2 &#8804; 90% had a 3.8-fold increase in risk of one-month death compared to those with SpO2 > 90%, although the difference did not reach a significant level. CONCLUSION: Multivariate analysis introduced age, WBC count, and NLR as predictors of one-month mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Vafadar Moradi, Elnaz; Teimouri, Ali; Rezaee, Ramin; Morovatdar, Negar; Foroughian, Mahdi; Layegh, Parvaneh; Rezvani Kakhki, Behrang; Ahmadi Koupaei, Seyed Reza; Ghorani, Vahideh",Am J Emerg Med,347,16

It is necessary to explore the aftereffects of COVID-19 in patients and compare the laboratory features of COVID-19 and other viral pneumonias in the recovery stages. METHODS: Forty-seven cases of COVID-19 and 45 cases of other viral pneumonias (control) were included in this study. The laboratory parameters were compared between COVID-19 and control patients as well as severe and moderate COVID-19 patients from the clinical recovery stage to the 4 weeks postdischarge recovery stage. RESULTS: A higher RDW-CV level and neutrophil percentage and lower levels of total proteins, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and MCH were found in COVID-19 patients compared with those in controls from the clinical recovery to the postdischarge recovery stages. Further analysis showed that decreases in lymphocytes, total proteins, and SOD and elevations in neutrophils, FDP, CRP, and ESR were more common in severe than moderate cases of COVID-19 during hospitalization; however, differences in these indicators, except total proteins, were not observed in the postdischarge recovery stages. Additionally, only 76.9% of COVID-19 patients were positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the convalescence stage, and one patient that was negative for specific IgG was reinfected. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that patients recovering from COVID-19 might need better care than that patients with other viral pneumonias due to the possibility of having poor immunity and nutritional conditions. These findings provide new insights to improve the understanding of COVID-19 and improve care for patients affected by these kinds of pandemics in the future.","Zhao, Guolian; Su, Yingying; Sun, Xiaomeng; Cui, Xiaoli; Dang, Liyun; Zhao, Lijuan; Tan, Xiaowen; Wang, Hongrui; Yang, Ming",J Clin Lab Anal,347,1

Inflammation is a multistep process driven by a great number of mediators which regulate specific aspects of the inflammatory response, in agreement with a well-defined chronobiological program. A great number of inflammation-related diseases show a deeply altered immune chronobiology (e.g., COVID-19-related cytokines storm). This aspect highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the inflammatory phenomenon. It is fundamental to study inflammation as a multilevel phenomenon. Of particular interest is the low-grade chronic inflammation, which is an etiological factor of many chronic diseases. Nowadays, the therapeutic approach to low grade chronic inflammation is one of the great challenges of traditional pharmacology. Currently, no drugs specifically designed for the treatment of chronic inflammatory forms are available. Today, bioregulatory systems medicine (BrSM) and low dose medicine (LDM), two pharmacological paradigms grounded in systems medicine, potentially represent new tools for the treatment of inflammation-related diseases. Scientific research has assessed the effectiveness and safety of both these therapeutic approaches, in particular for the management of chronic inflammatory conditions and chronic immunological dysregulations.","Fioranelli, Massimo; Roccia, Maria Grazia; Flavin, Dana; Cota, Linda",Int. j. mol. sci.

Methods: A systematic review was performed of mHealth apps that include symptom trackers. We searched the iOS App Store and Andriod Google Play using the words ""cancer,"" ""oncology,"" and ""symptom tracker."" Apps were included if they incorporated a symptom tracking function that could allow cancer patients to record symptoms and PROs. Apps were evaluated using the Mobile Apps Rating Scale (MARS), which includes engagement, functionality, aesthetics, information, and app subjective quality. Results: The initial search yielded 1189 apps, with 101 apps eligible after title and description screening. A total of 41 apps met eligibility criteria and were included in this study. The majority of apps (73%, n=30) were general health/pain symptom trackers, while 27% (n=11) were cancer-specific. The app quality mean scores assessed using MARS ranged from 2.43 to 4.23 (out of 5.00). Only one app has been trialed for usability among cancer patients.

Several studies have reported the impact of COVID-19 in general population; however, there is scarcity of information related to pharmacological management and maternal and perinatal outcomes during the pandemic. Altered physiological, anatomical, and immunological response during pregnancy makes it more susceptible to infections. Furthermore, during pregnancy, a woman undergoes multiple interactions with the health care system that increases her chance of getting infected; therefore, managing pregnant population presents a unique challenge. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: This systematic review seeks to answer the following questions in relation to COVID-19: What are the different clinical characteristics presented in maternal and perinatal population? What are the different maternal and perinatal outcome measures reported? What are the distinct therapeutic interventions reported to treat COVID-19? Is it safe to use ""medications"" used in the treatment of COVID-19 during antenatal, perinatal, postnatal, and breastfeeding? METHOD: The search will follow a comprehensive, sequential three step search strategy. Several databases relevant to COVID-19 and its impact on pregnancy including Medline, CINAHL, and LitCovid will be searched from the inception of the disease until the completion of data collection. The quality of this search strategy will be assessed using Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies Evidence-Based Checklist (PRESS EBC). An eligibility form will be developed for a transparent screening and inclusion/exclusion of studies. All studies will be sent to RefWorks, and abstraction will be independently performed by two researchers. Risk of bias will be assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials, Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for non-randomized studies, and for case reports, Murad et al. tool will be used. Decision to conduct meta-analysis will be based on several factors including homogeneity and outcome measures reported; otherwise, a narrative synthesis will be deemed appropriate. DISCUSSION: This systematic review will summarize the existing data on effect of COVID-19 on maternal and perinatal population. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review addressing therapeutic management and safety of medicines to treat COVID-19 during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

Baseline interleukin-6 (IL-6) was found to be associated with COVID-19 severity. Indeed, the significant increase of baseline IL-6 was positively correlated with the maximal body temperature during hospitalization and with the increased baseline of CRP, LDH, ferritin, and D-dimer. High baseline IL-6 was also associated with more progressed chest computed tomography (CT) findings. Significant decrease in IL-6 and improved CT assessment was found in patients during recovery, while IL-6 was further increased in exacerbated patients.

Although patient and physician attitudes are rapidly shifting toward greater telemedicine use in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, there remains uncertainty about telemedicine's regulatory future. Despite growing evidence of telemedicine's utility, there remain a number of significant medicolegal barriers to its mass adoption and wider implementation. Herein, we examine recent progress in state and federal regulations in the United States governing telemedicine's implementation in quality of care, finance and billing, privacy and confidentiality, risk and liability, and geography and interstate licensure, with special attention to how these concern teleneurosurgical practice. We also review contemporary topics germane to the future of teleneurosurgery, including the continued expansion of reciprocity in interstate licensure, expanded coverage for homecare services for chronic conditions, expansion of Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services reimbursements, and protections of store-and-forward technologies. Additionally, we discuss recent successes in teleneurosurgery, stroke care, and rehabilitation as models for teleneurosurgical best practices. As telemedicine technology continues to mature and its expanse grows, neurosurgeons' familiarity with its benefits, limitations, and controversies will best allow for its successful adoption in our field to maximize patient care and outcomes.","Cruz, Michael J; Nieblas-Bedolla, Edwin; Young, Christopher C; Feroze, Abdullah H; Williams, John R; Ellenbogen, Richard G; Levitt, Michael R",Neurosurgery,347,30

Among those, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are extremely versatile and, therefore, widely prescribed. Moreover, they are commonly considered as having a better safety profile compared to other antidepressants. For these reasons, when it comes to off-label prescribing, SSRIs rank among the top positions. In this review, we present the state of the art of off-label applications of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, ranging from migraine prophylaxis to SARS-CoV-2 antiviral properties. Research on SSRIs provided significant evidence in the treatment of premature ejaculation, both with the on-label dapoxetine 30 mg and the off-label paroxetine 20 mg. However, other than serotoninergic syndrome, serious conditions like increased bleeding rates, hyponatremia, hepatoxicity, and post-SSRIs sexual dysfunctions, are consistently more prominent when using such compounds. These insidious side effects might be frequently underestimated during common clinical practice, especially by non-psychiatrists. For this reason, some points must be addressed when using SSRIs. Among these, a psychiatric evaluation before every administration that falls outside the regulatory agencies-approved guidelines has to be considered mandatory. For these reasons, we aim with the present article to identify the risks of inappropriate uses and to advocate the need to actively boost research encouraging future clinical trials on this topic.","Jannini, Tommaso B; Di Lorenzo, Giorgio; Bianciardi, Emanuela; Niolu, Cinzia; Toscano, Massimiliano; Ciocca, Giacomo; Jannini, Emmanuele A; Siracusano, Alberto",Curr. neuropharmacol,347,6

Are the current precautionary measures effective? To answer these questions it is important to forecast regularly and accurately the spread of COVID-19 infections. Different time series forecasting models have been applied in the literature to tackle the pandemic situation. The current research efforts developed few of these models and validates its accuracy for selected countries. It becomes difficult to draw an objective comparison between the performance of these models at a global scale. This is because, the time series trend for the infection differs between the countries depending on the strategies adopted by the healthcare organizations to decrease the spread. Consequently, it is important to develop a tailored model for a country that allows healthcare organizations to better judge the effect of the undertaken precautionary measures, and provision more efficiently the needed resources to face this disease. This paper addresses this void. We develop and compare the performance of the time series models in the literature in terms of root mean squared error and mean absolute percentage error.","Ismail, Leila; Materwala, Huned; Znati, Taieb; Turaev, Sherzod; Khan, Moien A B",,347,6

We find that, without training, evaluators distinguished between GPT3- and human-authored text at random chance level. We explore three approaches for quickly training evaluators to better identify GPT3-authored text (detailed instructions, annotated examples, and paired examples) and find that while evaluators' accuracy improved up to 55%, it did not significantly improve across the three domains.

Although pregnant women are excluded from clinical trials, they will inevitably receive therapies whenever they seem effective in nonpregnant patients and even under compassionate use. Methods: We conducted a review of the literature on placental transfer and pregnancy safety data of drugs under current investigation for coronavirus disease 2019. Results: Regarding remdesivir, there are no data in pregnant women. Several other candidates already have safety data in pregnant women, because they are repurposed drugs already used for their established indications. Thus, they may be used in pregnancy, although their safety in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 may differ from conventional use. These include HIV protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir that have low placental transfer, interferon that does not cross the placental barrier, and hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine that has high placental transfer. There are also pregnancy safety and placental transfer data for colchicine, steroids, oseltamivir, azithromycin, and some monoclonal antibodies. However, some drugs are strictly prohibited in pregnancy because of known teratogenicity (thalidomide) or fetal toxicities (renin-angiotensin system blockers). Other candidates including tocilizumab, other interleukin 6 inhibitors, umifenovir, and favipiravir have insufficient data on pregnancy outcomes. Conclusion: In life-threatening cases of coronavirus disease 2019, the potential risks of therapy to the fetus may be more than offset by the benefit of curing the mother. Although preclinical and placental transfer studies are required for a number of potential anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 drugs, several medications can already be used in pregnant women.","Louchet, Margaux; Sibiude, Jeanne; Peytavin, Gilles; Picone, Olivier; Tréluyer, Jean-Marc; Mandelbrot, Laurent",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,347,6

Benefit of care from treatment must be carefully weighed against the potential of infection and morbidity from COVID-19. Furthermore, urologists need to be cognizant of their obligation for wise consumption of restricted healthcare resources and protection of the safety of their coworkers. Nonurgent in-person clinic visits should be postponed or conducted remotely via phone or teleconference. Prostate cancer screening, imaging, and biopsies may be suspended in general. Treatment may be safely deferred in low and intermediate risk patients. Surgery may be delayed in most high-risk patients and neoadjuvant ADT is generally not advocated prior to surgery. Initiation of long-term ADT coupled with EBRT subsequent to the pandemic may be favored as a feasible alternative in high-risk and very high-risk disease. In patients with cN1 disease, treatment within 6 weeks is advocated. Presurgery assessment should include testing for COVID-19 and preferably a chest imaging. In the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, surgery should be postponed whenever possible. All protective measurements suggested by national/international authorities must to be diligently followed during perioperative period. Strict precautions specific to laparoscopic/robotic surgery are required, considering the unproven but potential risk of aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 virus and spillage with pneumoperitoneum.

Furthermore, we also compared clinical and laboratory data between the SARS-Cov-2 infection with family cluster (n = 21) and those without family cluster (n = 16). We demonstrated that the duration of SARS-Cov-2 replication might be varied based on the different family clusters due to their different genetic backgrounds.

Evasion of IFN-mediated antiviral signaling is a common defense strategy that pathogenic viruses use to replicate and propagate in their host. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to efficiently block STAT1 and STAT2 nuclear translocation in order to impair transcriptional induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that the viral accessory protein Orf6 exerts this anti-IFN activity. We found that SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 localizes at the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and directly interacts with Nup98-Rae1 via its C-terminal domain to impair docking of cargo-receptor (karyopherin/importin) complex and disrupt nuclear import. In addition, we show that a methionine-to-arginine substitution at residue 58 impairs Orf6 binding to the Nup98-Rae1 complex and abolishes its IFN antagonistic function. All together our data unravel a mechanism of viral antagonism in which a virus hijacks the Nup98-Rae1 complex to overcome the antiviral action of IFN.","Miorin, Lisa; Kehrer, Thomas; Sanchez-Aparicio, Maria Teresa; Zhang, Ke; Cohen, Phillip; Patel, Roosheel S; Cupic, Anastasija; Makio, Tadashi; Mei, Menghan; Moreno, Elena; Danziger, Oded; White, Kris M; Rathnasinghe, Raveen; Uccellini, Melissa; Gao, Shengyan; Aydillo, Teresa; Mena, Ignacio; Yin, Xin; Martin-Sancho, Laura; Krogan, Nevan J; Chanda, Sumit K; Schotsaert, Michael; Wozniak, Richard W; Ren, Yi; Rosenberg, Brad R; Fontoura, Beatriz M A; García-Sastre, Adolfo",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,347,6

Recent literature has implicated COVID-19 in the reported increase in new-onset DM cases, as well as mixed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and HHS cases, however a rise in HHS cases alone has not been well reported [1,2]. We noted an anecdotal increase in the frequency of HHS cases in our pediatric tertiary care center following the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic. To investigate further, a retrospective chart review evaluating all patients with DM admitted in the first 6 months of 2019 and the first 6 months of 2020 was conducted. A diagnosis of HHS was defined as a blood glucose over 600 mg/dL with a serum osmolality (calculated or measured) greater than 320 mOsm/kg on initial laboratory evaluation. Patients with DKA, defined as a serum bicarbonate level less than 16 mmol/L with evidence of significant ketosis (serum ketones greater than 3 mmol/L), were excluded from the study. During the first 6 months of 2019, 1 patient met inclusion criteria. However, the diagnosis of HHS was complicated by a concurrent diagnosis of diabetes insipidus, which may have contributed to the hyperosmolar state, and a nonketotic lactic acidosis. Five HHS cases were noted in the first 6 months of 2020, 4 of which occurred in May and June. For the 2020 HHS cohort, the average patient age ± SD was 12 ± 3.34 years. The mean ± SD laboratory values included bicarbonate 18.2 ± 1.64 mmol/L, serum blood glucose 776.8 ± 30.75 mg/dL, calculated serum osmolality 328 ± 4.18 mOsm/kg, and HgA1C 12.72 ± 1.16%. All 5 patients in the 2020 cohort had new-onset DM, with 4 of the 5 patients having at least 1 positive DM antibody (GAD antibodies were positive in 3, ICA/IA-2 antibodies in 2, and Zinc Transporter 8 antibodies in 1). No patients displayed COVID-19 symptoms, and only 1 patient was tested for COVID-19 by PCR, which returned negative. However, SARS-CoV2 antibody testing was not available, and it is unknown if these patients had prior COVID-19 illness. In conclusion, we noted an increased incidence of HHS at our hospital, particularly among new-onset, antibody positive DM patients during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further study and investigation are needed to determine the cause of this increased local incidence, and if infectious, social, or economic influences related to the COVID-19 pandemic contributed.

Antiphospholipidic antibodies were found in some studies. AIM: Assessment of protein S activity in patients with COVID-19 as a cause this prothrombotic state, and of the association of protein S activity with worse outcome. METHODS: All patients admitted for COVID-19 disease in a university hospital between 15th of May and 15th of July 2020 were prospectively enrolled into this cohort study. Patients treated with antivitamin K anticoagulants and with liver disease were excluded. All patients had protein S activity determined at admission. The main outcome was survival, secondary outcomes were clinical severity and lung damage. RESULTS: 91 patients were included, of which 21 (23.3%) died. Protein S activity was decreased in 65% of the patients. Death was associated with lower activity of protein S (median 42% vs. 58%, p<0.001), and the association remained after adjustment for age, inflammation markers and ALAT. There was a dose-response relationship between protein S activity and clinical severity (Kendall_tau coefficient = -0.320, p < 0.001; Jonckheere-Terpstra for trend: p<0.001) or pulmonary damage on CT scan (Kendall_tau coefficient = -0.290, p<0.001; Jonckheere-Terpstra for trend: p<0.001). High neutrophil count was also independently associated with death (p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Protein S activity was lower in COVID-19 patients, and its level was associated with survival and disease severity, suggesting that it may have a role in the thrombotic manifestations of the disease.","Stoichitoiu, Laura Elena; Pinte, Larisa; Balea, Marius Ioan; Nedelcu, Valentin; Badea, Camelia; Baicus, Cristian",Rom. j. intern. med,347,5

We study one such manifestation of racial harassment that Asian employees may face in the workplace: Leaders' use of stigmatizing labels for COVID-19 such as the ""Chinese Virus"" and ""Kung Flu."" Integrating organizational justice theories with research on racial harassment in the workplace, we theorize that leaders' use of stigmatizing COVID-19 labels reduces employees' perceptions of interpersonal justice, which subsequently impact employees' emotional exhaustion and work engagement. We further theorize that while such effects will be stronger among Asian employees who experience both moral anger and reduced public collective self-esteem, that the effects will also be present among non-Asian employees who experience moral anger. Using one survey (Study 1) and one experiment (Study 2), we find support for our predictions. We find that leaders' use of stigmatizing language to depict COVID-19 leads to deleterious workplace experiences for employees, and especially for Asian employees. The current research thus deepens our understanding of the relatively understudied work experiences of Asian Americans and brings to light the underlying psychological mechanisms linking racial harassment and employee work outcomes for both targeted employees and employees not targeted.

However, these traditional chalcogen doping can only take the place of a sulfur element and not essentially change the inherent electrical nature of MoS2. Herein, novel Te-MoS2 materials have been synthesized via a simple hydrothermal process under Te doping. A half-metallic Te occupies the position of an Mo atom to form Te-S bonds, which is different from the same group Se element. After theoretical modeling and electrochemical measurements, it was observed that the formation of Te-S bonds can increase the electrical conductivity (about 530 times increment) and mitigate the mechanical stress to ensure the whole structural stability during the repeated insertion/extraction of K-ions. Moreover, the insertion of Te into the lattice of MoS2 generated the fractional phase transformation from 2H to the 1T phase of MoS2 and 1T&2H in-plane hetero-junction. Benefiting from these advantages, the 1T&2H Te-MoS2 anode delivered high capacities of 718 and 342 mA h g-1 at 50 and 5000 mA g-1, respectively, and an ultra-stable cycling performance (88.1% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 2 A g-1).

METHODS: The COVID-19 TCM treatment plan and syndrome related literature published before February 24, 2020 was searched and a database was established. TCM common syndrome characteristics of COVID-19 were analyzed by the method of latent structure and system clustering combined with frequency and constituent ratio, which were conducted by Lantern 5.0 and SPSS 20.0. RESULTS: Forty-two literatures about treatment plans, and 212 syndromes records were enrolled. Latent structure model was established based on 53 symptoms with frequency over 10, and 14 latent variables and 7 syndromes were concluded by comprehensive clustering, including syndrome of pathogenic heat invading lung, internal block and outward desertion, syndrome of dampness heat accumulating lung, syndrome of Qi and Yin deficiency, syndrome of epidemic virus closing lung, syndrome of cold dampness closing lung and syndrome of Qi deficiency of lung and spleen. Factor analysis was conducted for 53 symptoms, which were reported more than 10 times, and 14 common factors were obtained. Symptoms with load coefficient over 0.3 were clustered and 6 syndromes were obtained, including syndrome of epidemic virus closing lung, syndrome of pathogenic heat invading lung, syndrome of Qi and Yin deficiency, internal block and outward desertion, syndrome of cold dampness closing lung, and syndrome of dampness heat accumulating lung. The literatures included 25 syndromes, and the syndromes with constituent ratio over 5% were internal block and outward desertion (14.62%), syndrome of epidemic virus closing lung (13.68%), syndrome of dampness heat accumulating lung (12.74%), syndrome of Qi deficiency of lung (10.85%), spleen and syndrome of cold dampness closing lung (8.50%), syndrome of Qi and Yin deficiency (8.50%), syndrome of pathogenic heat invading lung (8.02%) and syndrome of dampness repressing defensive Qi of lung (5.66%). Eighty-seven symptoms whose cumulative frequency was 2 838 were referred, including greasy fur (5.25%), fever (4.83%), red tongue (4.37%), rapid pulse (3.74%) and fatigue (3.46%). According to the results above, the common syndromes and their symptoms of COVID-19 were: (1) syndrome of pathogenic heat invading lung: fever, cough, throat-drying, headache, all of the body distressed and constipation, etc.; (2) syndrome of cold dampness closing lung: aversion to cold, all of the body distressed, nausea and vomiting, abdominal distention and loose stool, etc.; (3) syndrome of dampness heat accumulating lung: cough, sticky phlegm, anorexia, thirst without desire to drink and constipation, etc.; (4) syndrome of epidemic virus closing lung: fever, cough, yellow phlegm, wheezing, suffocation and purple lips, etc.; (5) internal block and outward desertion: coma, feel fidgety, suffocation, sweating and feel cold and purple lips, etc.; (6) syndrome of Qi and Yin deficiency: dry cough, sweating, fatigue, thirsty, feverish feeling in palms and soles and loose stool, etc.; (7) syndrome of Qi deficiency of lung and spleen: cough, wheezing, sweating, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and loose stool, et al. CONCLUSIONS: The common syndromes of COVID-19 were syndrome of pathogenic heat invading lung, syndrome of cold dampness closing lung, syndrome of dampness heat accumulating lung, syndrome of epidemic virus closing lung, internal block and outward desertion, syndrome of Qi and Yin deficiency and syndrome of Qi deficiency of lung and spleen.

For contact tracing to be effective, those with symptoms must self-report themselves while their contacts must self-isolate when asked. However, policies such as legal enforcement of self-isolation can create trade-offs by dissuading individuals from self-reporting. We use an existing branching process model to examine which aspects of contact tracing adherence should be prioritized. We consider an inverse relationship between self-isolation adherence and self-reporting engagement, assuming that increasingly strict self-isolation policies will result in fewer individuals self-reporting to the programme. We find that policies which increase the average duration of self-isolation, or that increase the probability that people self-isolate at all, at the expense of reduced self-reporting rate, will not decrease the risk of a large outbreak and may increase the risk, depending on the strength of the trade-off. These results suggest that policies to increase self-isolation adherence should be implemented carefully. Policies that increase self-isolation adherence at the cost of self-reporting rates should be avoided.

In the Gram-positive model bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, the final maturation steps of the two large ribosomal subunit (50S) rRNAs, 23S and 5S pre-rRNAs, are catalyzed by the double-strand specific ribonucleases (RNases) Mini-RNase III and RNase M5, respectively. Here we present a protocol that allowed us to solve the 3.0 and 3.1 Å resolution cryoelectron microscopy structures of these RNases poised to cleave their pre-rRNA substrates within the B. subtilis 50S particle. These data provide the first structural insights into rRNA maturation in bacteria by revealing how these RNases recognize and process double-stranded pre-rRNA. Our structures further uncover how specific ribosomal proteins act as chaperones to correctly fold the pre-rRNA substrates and, for Mini-III, anchor the RNase to the ribosome. These r-proteins thereby serve a quality-control function in the process from accurate ribosome assembly to rRNA processing.","Oerum, Stephanie; Dendooven, Tom; Catala, Marjorie; Gilet, Laetitia; Dégut, Clément; Trinquier, Aude; Bourguet, Maxime; Barraud, Pierre; Cianferani, Sarah; Luisi, Ben F; Condon, Ciarán; Tisné, Carine",Mol. cell,347,22

While more traditional clinical settings were prioritized and made available only to senior students, the use of virtual simulation provided an opportunity to safely pivot from the usual placement to a comparable practical learning modality to maintain clinical competence during unprecedented public health restrictions and mitigation strategies. Like many others across the globe, nursing students in a Canadian university continued their nursing education predominantly using virtual simulation for an entire academic year to avoid catastrophic delays in entering the workforce and to ultimately protect the health service delivery needs throughout the oncoming waves of the pandemic. The purpose of the paper is to describe guiding principles established in a School of Nursing as a means to responsibly and ethically adopt a replacement of traditional clinical practicum experiences with virtual simulation. The principles for incorporating virtual simulation included the need to achieve and maintain a high level of quality of learning experiences, a fluid delivery articulated in phases, and a financial commitment by the learning institution. As the global pandemic may see a fourth wave, the use of virtual simulation will continue to present a major change for clinical practicum and establishing principles for the use of virtual simulation has demonstrated to be an integral part of safe pandemic response and post-pandemic recovery.","Peachey, Laurie McParland Tammie Goldsworthy Sandra Williams Veronika",Clinical Simulation in Nursing,347,1

Neurosurgical patients are often critically ill and at particularly high risk for COVID, and the pandemic has produced ever-shifting circumstances to allow their continued care. This study explores the psychologic impact of the pandemic on neurosurgical residents at a single institution. METHODS: Residents completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomology 30 (IDS-30), two validated surveys, before and during the pandemic. PSS scores range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicative of increased stress. IDS-30 ranges from 0 to 84 with higher scores indicating more severe levels of depression. Survey results were compared collectively among residents and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The surveys had 19 out of 28 total responders (68%). Mean score on the PSS was 16.1 prepandemic and 14.7 during the pandemic (P > 0.05). The mean score on the IDS-30 was 14.7 prepandemic and 12.0 during the pandemic (P > 0.05). Matching the survey questionnaire results by each resident revealed an average decrease of 2.3 and 2.4 for the PSS and IDS-30, respectively.

The musical features such as pitch, timbre, volume and duration are mapped based on the coronavirus protein sequence. Three different viruses Influenza, Ebola and Coronavirus were studied and compared through their auditory virus sequences by implementing Haar wavelet transform. The sonification of the coronavirus benefits in understanding the protein structures by enhancing the hidden features. Further, it makes a clear difference in the representation of coronavirus compared with other viruses, which will help in various research works related to virus sequence.

Current EMR education is inadequate, with literature showing frequent deficiencies in skills needed to obtain and interpret data. This study aims to evaluate pediatric interns' perception of EMR inclusion in scenario-based simulation training. Methods A total of 13 pediatric interns participated in an EMR-enhanced, multidisciplinary simulation of a pediatric patient with septic shock during the 2019-2020 academic year. Following the simulation, the interns participated in a semi-structured interview to evaluate the experience of having the EMR incorporated into the simulation and what benefits it offers. Results Of the 13 interns, 12 (92%) felt that incorporating the EMR into the simulation increased the realism of the scenario. All (100%) interns reported that EMR inclusion led to increased learning about the EMR, including gaining or re-learning skills needed to access or interpret electronic clinical data. Participants felt that EMR inclusion in the simulation provided valuable learning opportunities not present in traditional EMR education. Conclusions Integrating the EMR into simulation is viewed positively by pediatric interns, is perceived to improve simulation realism, and helps teach important EMR skills.

In the literature, mobile work has mostly been discussed from a microergonomic perspective, considering detachment, stress, strain, and life-domain balance. However, the macroergonomic or institutional perspectives have often been neglected, although for occupational health and safety (OHS) management, as well as occupational health and safety systems, many questions remain unanswered. Therefore, in the present paper, information and communication technologies (ICT)-enabled mobile work is described taking into account institutional and regulative, as well as company-related, requirements. As the literature-based analysis was able to show, existing regulations cover many aspects of mobile work arrangements but also offer starting points for a more concrete protection of mobile workers. Furthermore, there are challenges regarding the enforcement of regulation. In this regard, new technologies might offer the chance to improve the interactions between institutional and company-related occupational health and safety systems. Additionally, 278 co-funded research projects in Germany were categorized, yielding 18 projects on new ways of work, of which another eleven projects addressed different aspects of mobile work.

This study was conducted to investigate the differences in the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 between the epicenter and peripheral areas of pandemic and thereby generate information that would be potentially helpful in formulating clinical practice recommendations to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The Sichuan & Wuhan Collaboration Research Group for COVID-19 established two retrospective cohorts that separately reflect the epicenter and peripheral area during the early pandemic. The epidemiology, clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients in the two groups were compared. Multivariate regression analyses were used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with regard to the outcomes. RESULTS: The Wuhan (epicenter) cohort included 710 randomly selected patients, and the peripheral (Sichuan) cohort included 474 consecutive patients. A higher proportion of patients from the periphery had upper airway symptoms, whereas a lower proportion of patients in the epicenter had lower airway symptoms and comorbidities. Patients in the epicenter had a higher risk of death (aOR=7.64), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (aOR=1.66), delayed time from illness onset to hospital and ICU admission (aOR=6.29 and aOR=8.03, respectively), and prolonged duration of viral shedding (aOR=1.64). CONCLUSIONS: The worse outcomes in the epicenter could be explained by the prolonged time from illness onset to hospital and ICU admission. This could potentially have been associated with elevated systemic inflammation secondary to organ dysfunction and prolonged duration of virus shedding independent of age and comorbidities. Thus, early supportive care could achieve better clinical outcomes.

Strikingly the rate of coronavirus infection among the young-age population is the highest in SAARC countries as more than 80% population of the SAARC countries are young who constitute the working-age group. The disease transmission also occurs at a slower rate presumably due to diverse lifestyles of different ethnicities, immunity and genetic traits; but not because of the hot and humid weather despite previous assumptions. Since SAARC countries comprise 23.75% of the world population and the largest portion of these people is the young working-class, some immediate measures need to be implemented to save these valuable lives from COVID-19.

On penalized logistic regression analysis, NIV failure was associated with higher APACHE (OR 1.12; 95%CI 1.01-1.24), severe ARDS (OR 3.99; 1.24-12.9), D-dimer ≥1000 ng/ml (OR 2.60; 1.16-5.87), need for inotropes or dialysis (OR 12.7; 4.3-37.7) and nosocomial infections (OR 13.6; 4.06-45.9). Overall mortality was 30.1%. In patients requiring intubation, time to intubation was longer in non-survivors than survivors (Median IQR 5 (3-8) vs. 3 (2-3) days, p<0.001). Conclusions NIV can be used successfully in C-ARF. Illness severity and need for non-respiratory organ support predict NIV failure.","Chacko, Binila; Thomas, Lovely; Sharma, Roshni; Yadav, Bijesh; Jeyaseelan, Lakshmanan; Arul, Ashwin O.; Victor, Punitha; Chandiraseharan, Vignesh K.; Lenin, Audrin; Carey, Ronald AB.; Jayakaran, Jonathan AJ.; Krishnaswami, Rajiv K.; Peter, John Victor",Mayo Clin Proc,347,28

METHODS: We abstracted the following clinical data from our transplant registry from 1/1/2021 to 6/2/2021: demographics, details of COVID‐19 vaccination, incidence of COVID‐19, and related mortality. We calculated incidence of symptomatic COVID‐19 per 1000/person days at risk and incidence rate ratio (IRR). RESULTS: Among 2151 SOTRs, 912 were fully vaccinated, and 1239 were controls (1151 unvaccinated, 88 partially vaccinated). Almost 70% of vaccinated subjects received the mRNA‐1273 vaccine. There were 65 cases of COVID‐19 that occurred during the study period – four occurred among fully vaccinated individuals and 61 among controls (including two in partially vaccinated individuals). Incidence rate for COVID‐19 was 0.065 (95% CI 0.024–0.17) per 1000 person days in vaccinated versus 0.34 (95% CI 0.26–0.44) per 1000/person days in the control group; IRR was 0.19 (95% CI 0.049 −0.503, p < 0.005). There were no COVID‐19 related deaths in the four breakthrough infections and two of 61 (3.3%) among controls. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate real world clinical effectiveness of COVID‐19 vaccination in SOTRs with an almost 80% reduction in the incidence of symptomatic COVID‐19 versus unvaccinated SOTRs during the same time.","Aslam, Saima; Adler, Eric; Mekeel, Kristin; Little, Susan J.",Transpl Infect Dis,347,10

We evaluate these claims by examining racial and ethnic differences in the likelihood of work-related exposure to COVID-19. We extend previous studies by considering 12 racial and ethnic groups and five types of potential occupational exposure to the virus: exposure to infection, physical proximity to others, face-to-face discussions, interactions with external customers and the public, and working indoors. Most importantly, we stratify our results by occupational status, defined as the proportion of workers within each occupation with some college education. This measure serves as a proxy for whether workplaces and workers employ significant COVID-19-related risk reduction strategies. We use the 2018 American Community Survey to identify recent workers by occupation, and link 409 occupations to information on work context from the Occupational Information Network to identify potential COVID-related risk factors. We then examine the racial/ethnic distribution of all frontline workers and frontline workers at highest potential risk of COVID-19, by occupational status and by sex. The results indicate that, contrary to expectation, White frontline workers are often overrepresented in high-risk jobs while Black and Latino frontline workers are generally underrepresented in these jobs. However, disaggregation of the results by occupational status shows that, in contrast to Whites and several Asian groups, Latino and Black frontline workers are overrepresented in lower status occupations overall and in lower status occupations associated with high risk, and are thus less likely to have adequate COVID-19 protections. Our findings suggest that greater work exposures likely contribute to a higher prevalence of COVID-19 among Latino and Black adults and underscore the need for measures to reduce potential exposure for workers in low status occupations and for the development of programs outside the workplace.","Goldman, Noreen; Pebley, Anne R.; Lee, Keunbok; Andrasfay, Theresa; Pratt, Boriana",medRxiv,347,5

Evaluation of Covid-19 vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants is urgently needed to inform vaccine development and use. METHODS: In this phase 2a/b, multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in South Africa, healthy human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative adults (18 to 84 years) or medically stable people living with HIV (PLWH) (18 to 84 years) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, administered 21 days apart, of either NVX-CoV2373 nanoparticle vaccine (5 μg recombinant spike protein with 50 μg Matrix-M1 adjuvant) or placebo. The primary endpoints were safety and vaccine efficacy ≥7 days following the second dose against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 in previously SARS-CoV-2 uninfected participants. RESULTS: A total of 4387 participants were randomized and dosed at least once, 2199 with NVX-CoV2373 and 2188 with placebo. Approximately 30% of participants were seropositive at baseline. Among 2684 baseline seronegative participants (94% HIV-negative; 6% PLWH), 15 and 29 predominantly mild to moderate Covid-19 cases were noted in NVX-CoV2373 and placebo recipients, respectively; vaccine efficacy was 49.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.1 to 72.8). Efficacy in HIV-negative participants was 60.1% (95% CI: 19.9 to 80.1) and did not differ by baseline serostatus; 38 (92.7%) of 41 sequenced cases were the B.1.351 variant. Post-hoc vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 was 51.0% (95% CI: −0.6 to 76.2) in HIV-negative participants. Preliminary local and systemic reactogenicity were primarily mild to moderate and transient, and higher with NVX-CoV2373; serious adverse events were rare in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The NVX-CoV2373 vaccine was efficacious in preventing Covid-19, which was predominantly mild to moderate and due to the B.1.351 variant.","Shinde, Vivek; Bhikha, Sutika; Hoosain, Zaheer; Archary, Moherndran; Bhorat, Qasim; Fairlie, Lee; Lalloo, Umesh; Masilela, Mduduzi S.

If not detected and treated in time, COVID-19 can cause multi-organ failure and even death. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the behavior of the spread of COVID-19 as well as the projection of infections and deaths. This information is very relevant so that public health organizations can distribute financial resources efficiently and take appropriate containment measures. In this research, we compare different time series methodologies to predict the number of confirmed cases of and deaths from COVID-19 in Chile. METHODS: The methodology used in this research consisted of modeling cases of both confirmed diagnoses and deaths from COVID-19 in Chile using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA henceforth) models, Exponential Smoothing techniques, and Poisson models for time-dependent count data. Additionally, we evaluated the accuracy of the predictions using a training set and a test set. RESULTS: The dataset used in this research indicated that the most appropriate model is the ARIMA time series model for predicting the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, whereas for predicting the number of deaths from COVID-19 in Chile, the most suitable approach is the damped trend method. CONCLUSION: The ARIMA models are an alternative to modeling the behavior of the spread of COVID-19; however, depending on the characteristics of the dataset, other methodologies can better predict the behavior of these records, for example, the Holt-Winter method implemented with time-dependent count data.","Barría-Sandoval, Claudia; Ferreira, Guillermo; Benz-Parra, Katherine; López-Flores, Pablo",PLoS One,347,24

METHODS: Chest computed tomography (CT) studies in 303 consecutive patients with suspected COVID-19 were reviewed by 3 fellowship-trained chest radiologists. Cases were assigned an impression of typical, indeterminate, atypical, or negative for COVID-19 pneumonia according to the RSNA expert consensus statement reporting guidelines, and interobserver analysis was performed. Objective CT features associated with COVID-19 pneumonia and distribution of findings were recorded. RESULTS: The Fleiss kappa for all observers was almost perfect for typical (0.815), atypical (0.806), and negative (0.962) COVID-19 appearances (P < .0001) and substantial (0.636) for indeterminate COVID-19 appearance (P < .0001). Using Cramer V analysis, there were very strong correlations between all radiologists’ interpretations, statistically significant for all (typical, indeterminate, atypical, and negative) COVID-19 appearances (P < .001). Objective CT imaging findings were recorded in similar percentages of typical cases by all observers. CONCLUSION: The RSNA expert consensus statement on reporting chest CT findings related to COVID-19 demonstrates substantial to almost perfect interobserver agreement among chest radiologists in a relatively large cohort of patients with clinically suspected COVID-19. It therefore serves as a reliable reference framework for radiologists to accurately communicate their level of suspicion based on the presence of evidence-based objective findings.","Byrne, Danielle; O’Neill, Siobhan B.; Müller, Nestor L.; Silva Müller, C.

Our aim was to compare the occurrence of COVID-19 between rheumatic disease patients on hydroxychloroquine with individuals from the same household not taking the drug during the first 8 weeks of community viral transmission in Brazil. METHODS: This baseline cross-sectional analysis is part of a 24-week observational multi-center study involving 22 Brazilian academic outpatient centers. All information regarding COVID-19 symptoms, epidemiological, clinical, and demographic data were recorded on a specific web-based platform using telephone calls from physicians and medical students. COVID-19 was defined according to the Brazilian Ministry of Health (BMH) criteria.

RESULTS: From March 29th to May 17st, 2020, a total of 10,443 participants were enrolled, including 5166 (53.9%) rheumatic disease patients, of whom 82.5% had systemic erythematosus lupus, 7.8% rheumatoid arthritis, 3.7% Sjögren’s syndrome and 0.8% systemic sclerosis. In total, 1822 (19.1%) participants reported flu symptoms within the 30 days prior to enrollment, of which 3.1% fulfilled the BMH criteria, but with no significant difference between rheumatic disease patients (4.03%) and controls (3.25%). After adjustments for multiple confounders, the main risk factor significantly associated with a COVID-19 diagnosis was lung disease (OR 1.63; 95% CI 1.03–2.58); and for rheumatic disease patients were diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.19–6.63) and glucocorticoids above 10 mg/ day (OR 2.05; 95% CI 1.31–3.19). In addition, a recent influenza vaccination had a protective effect (OR 0.674; 95% CI 0.46–0.98).

New studies have described the production and dissemination of sprays during simulated dental procedures, but findings lack generalizability beyond their measurements setting. This study aims to describe the fundamental mechanisms associated with spray production from rotary dental instrumentation with particular focus on what are currently considered high-risk components—namely, the production of small droplets that may remain suspended in the room environment for extended periods and the dispersal of high-velocity droplets resulting in formites at distant surfaces. Procedural sprays were parametrically studied with variables including rotation speed, burr-to-tooth contact, and coolant premisting modified and visualized using high-speed imaging and broadband or monochromatic laser light–sheet illumination. Droplet velocities were estimated and probability density maps for all laser illuminated sprays generated. The impact of varying the coolant parameters on heating during instrumentation was considered. Complex structured sprays were produced by water-cooled rotary instruments, which, in the worst case of an air turbine, included droplet projection speeds in excess of 12 m/s and the formation of millions of small droplets that may remain suspended. Elimination of premisting (mixing of coolant water and air prior to burr contact) resulted in a significant reduction in small droplets, but radial atomization may still occur and is modified by burr-to-tooth contact. Spatial probability distribution mapping identified a threshold for rotation speeds for radial atomization between 80,000 and 100,000 rpm. In this operatory mode, cutting efficiency is reduced but sufficient coolant effectiveness appears to be maintained. Multiple mechanisms for atomization of fluids from rotatory instrumentation exist, but parameters can be controlled to modify key spray characteristics during the current crisis.","Sergis, A.; Wade, W.G.; Gallagher, J.E.; Morrell, A.P.; Patel, S.; Dickinson, C.M.; Nizarali, N.; Whaites, E.; Johnson, J.; Addison, O.; Hardalupas, Y.",J Dent Res,347,20

Computed tomography scanning and polymerase chain reaction tests are considered reliable methods for the detection of COVID-19. However, the specificity and reliability of polymerase chain reaction tests and ground-glass opacity (GGO) on thorax computed tomography images in diagnosing COVID-19 are still being disputed. Our aim was to compare the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, whose efficiency in differentiating between viral and bacterial infections has previously been studied, with computed tomography and polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study that included patients treated in a tertiary care hospital emergency service pandemic polyclinic between 14 March and 1 June 2020. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios of patients with polymerase chain reaction tests and ground-glass opacities on computed tomography were calculated. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios of polymerase chain reaction-negative patients with computed tomography images were compared with the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios of polymerase chain reaction-positive patients with computed tomography images. RESULTS: A total of 631 patients were included in this study. Thorax computed tomography scans were obtained from all patients. The mean neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio of patients with ground-glass opacities was 3.50 ± 2.12, whereas that of patients without ground-glass opacities was 2.90 ± 2.01. This difference was also statistically significant. Polymerase chain reaction swab samples were obtained from 282 patients (44.7%). The mean neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio of polymerase chain reaction-positive patients was 2.38 ± 1.02, whereas that of polymerase chain reaction-negative patients was 3.97 ± 2.25. The difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Many studies are undoubtedly required to determine the efficiency of the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio in COVID-19 diagnosis. However, we postulate that evaluating the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio along with computed tomography and polymerase chain reaction can assist in the diagnosis of patients.","Örün, Serhat; Erdem, Mustafa Numan",SAGE Open Med,347,33

In response to the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, Taipei City Government officials developed a School-based Infectious Disease Syndromic Surveillance System (SID-SSS). Teachers and nurses from preschools to universities in all 12 districts within Taipei are required to daily report cases of symptomatic children or sick leave requests through the SID-SSS. The pre-diagnosis at schools is submitted firstly as common pediatric disease syndrome-groups and re-submitted after confirmation by physicians. We retrieved these data from January 2010 to August 2011 for spatio-temporal analysis and evaluated the temporal trends with cases obtained from both the Emergency Department-based Syndromic Surveillance System (ED-SSS) and the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 (LHID2005). Through the SID-SSS, enterovirus-like illness (EVI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) were the two most reported syndrome groups (77.6% and 15.8% among a total of 19,334 cases, respectively). The pre-diagnosis judgments made by school teachers and nurses showed high consistency with physicians’ clinical diagnoses for EVI (97.8%) and ILI (98.9%). Most importantly, the SID-SSS had better timeliness with earlier peaks of EVI and ILI than those in the ED-SSS. Furthermore, both of the syndrome groups in these two surveillance systems had the best correlation reaching 0.98 and 0.95, respectively (p<0.01). Spatio-temporal analysis observed the patterns of EVI and ILI both diffuse from the northern suburban districts to central Taipei, with ILI spreading faster. This novel system can identify early suspected cases of two important pediatric infections occurring at schools, and clusters from schools/families. It was also cost-effective (95.5% of the operation cost reduced and 59.7% processing time saved). The timely surveillance of mild EVI and ILI cases integrated with spatial analysis may help public health decision-makers with where to target for enhancing surveillance and prevention measures to minimize severe cases.","Weng, Ting Chia; Chan, Ta Chien; Lin, Hsien Tang; Chang, Chia Kun Jasper; Wang, Wen Wen; Li, Zheng Rong Tiger; Cheng, Hao-Yuan; Chu, Yu-Roo; Chiu, Allen Wen-Hsiang; Yen, Muh-Yong; King, Chwan-Chuen",PLoS One,347,14

Patients and methods A vocal biomarker, a unitless scalar with a value between 0-1, was developed based on 434 voice samples. The biomarker training was followed by a prospective, multi-center, observational study. All subjects were tested for SARS-CoV-2, had their voice recorded to a smartphone application and gave their informed consent to participate in the study. The association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the vocal biomarker was evaluated. Results Final study population included 80 subjects with a median age of 29 [23-36], of whom 68% were men. Forty patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Infected patients were 12 times more likely to report at least one symptom (odds ratio 11.8, p<.001). The vocal biomarker was significantly higher among infected patients (0.11 [0.06-0.17] vs. 0.19 [0.12-0.3], p=.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) evaluating the association of the vocal biomarker with SARS-CoV-2 status was 72%. With a biomarker threshold of 0.115, the results translated to a sensitivity and specificity of 85% [95% CI: 70-94%] and 53% [95% CI: 36-69%], respectively. When added to a self-reported symptom classifier, the AUC significantly improved from 0.775 to 0.85. Conclusion Voice analysis is associated with SARS-CoV-2 status and holds the potential to improve the accuracy of self-reported symptom-based screening tools.

The present study examines the consequences of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection in mice lacking CCL2 (CCL2(−/−)) in order to determine if signaling by this chemokine is relevant in host defense. Intracerebral infection of CCL2(−/−) mice with MHV did not result in increased morbidity or mortality as compared to either wild type or CCR2(−/−) mice and CCL2(−/−) mice cleared replicating virus from the brain. In contrast, CCR2(−/−) mice displayed an impaired ability to clear virus from the brain that was accompanied by a reduction in the numbers of antigen-specific T cells as compared to both CCL2(−/−) and wild-type mice. The paucity in T cell accumulation within the central nervous system (CNS) of MHV-infected CCR2(−/−) mice was not the result of either a deficiency in antigen-presenting cell (APC) accumulation within draining cervical lymph nodes (CLN) or the generation of virus-specific T cells within this compartment. A similar reduction in macrophage infiltration into the CNS was observed in both CCL2(−/−) and CCR2(−/−) mice when compared to wild-type mice, indicating that both CCL2 and CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) contribute to macrophage migration and accumulation within the CNS following MHV infection. Together, these data demonstrate that CCR2, but not CCL2, is important in host defense following viral infection of the CNS, and CCR2 ligand(s), other than CCL2, participates in generating a protective response.","Held, Katherine S.; Chen, Benjamin P.; Kuziel, William A.; Rollins, Barrett J.; Lane, Thomas E.",Virology,347,20

We conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials assessing treatment with remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, ritonavir, dexamethasone, and convalescent plasma, for hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The outcomes were mortality, clinical improvement, duration of ventilation, duration of oxygen support, duration of hospitalization, virological clearance, and severe adverse events. A total of 48 studies were retrieved from the databases. Eleven articles were finally included in the data extraction and qualitative synthesis of results. The meta-analysis suggests a benefit of dexamethasone versus standard care in the reduction of risk of mortality at day 28; and the clinical improvement at days 14 and 28 in patients treated with remdesivir. We can conclude that dexamethasone would have a better result in hospitalized patients, especially in low-resources settings. The analysis of the main treatments proposed for hospitalized patients is of vital importance to reduce mortality in low-income countries, since the COVID-19 pandemic had an economic impact worldwide with the loss of jobs and economic decline in countries with scarce resources.

It suggests focusing on understanding mental distress as stemming from problems in living, using medications as agents facilitating psychotherapy, or as a last resort and short-term help, according to the principles of harm reduction. It argues that understanding drugs as psychoactive substances and studying the subjective effects they produce could lead to better utilization of medications and improvements in terms of conceptualizing and assessing treatment effects. Qualitative research could be particularly useful in that regard. It also advocates a radical departure from current diagnostic systems and proposes a synthesis of already existing alternatives to be used for both research and clinical purposes. Accordingly, a general idea for an alternative mental health care system, based on a combination of Open Dialogue Approach, Soteria houses, individual and group psychotherapy, cautious prescribing, services helping with drug discontinuation, peer-led services and social support is presented. The proposition could be seen as a first step towards developing a systemic alternative that could replace the currently dominating approach instead of focusing on implementing partial solutions that can be co-opted by the current one.","Stupak, Radosław; Dobroczyński, Bartłomiej",Int J Environ Res Public Health,347,7

Although important progress has been made toward understanding the biology of PHEV, many aspects of its life cycle remain obscure. Here we dissected the molecular mechanism underlying cellular entry and intracellular trafficking of PHEV in mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro-2a) cells. We first performed a thin-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) assay to characterize the kinetics of PHEV, and we found that viral entry and transfer occur via membranous coating-mediated endo- and exocytosis. To verify the roles of distinct endocytic pathways, systematic approaches were used, including pharmacological inhibition, RNA interference, confocal microscopy analysis, use of fluorescently labeled virus particles, and overexpression of a dominant negative (DN) mutant. Quantification of infected cells showed that PHEV enters cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and that low pH, dynamin, cholesterol, and Eps15 are indispensably involved in this process. Intriguingly, PHEV invasion leads to rapid actin rearrangement, suggesting that the intactness and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are positively correlated with viral endocytosis. We next investigated the trafficking of internalized PHEV and found that Rab5- and Rab7-dependent pathways are required for the initiation of a productive infection. Furthermore, a GTPase activation assay suggested that endogenous Rab5 is activated by PHEV and is crucial for viral progression. Our findings demonstrate that PHEV hijacks the CME and endosomal system of the host to enter and traffic within neural cells, providing new insights into PHEV pathogenesis and guidance for antiviral drug design. IMPORTANCE Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), a nonsegmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus, invades the central nervous system (CNS) and causes neurological dysfunction. Neural cells are its targets for viral progression. However, the detailed mechanism underlying PHEV entry and trafficking remains unknown. PHEV is the etiological agent of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis, which is an acute and highly contagious disease that causes numerous deaths in suckling piglets and enormous economic losses in China. Understanding the viral entry pathway will not only advance our knowledge of PHEV infection and pathogenesis but also open new approaches to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we employed systematic approaches to dissect the internalization and intracellular trafficking mechanism of PHEV in Neuro-2a cells. This is the first report to describe the process of PHEV entry into nerve cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis in a dynamin-, cholesterol-, and pH-dependent manner that requires Rab5 and Rab7.","Li, Zi; Zhao, Kui; Lan, Yungang; Lv, Xiaoling; Hu, Shiyu; Guan, Jiyu; Lu, Huijun; Zhang, Jing; Shi, Junchao; Yang, Yawen; Song, Deguang; Gao, Feng; He, Wenqi",J Virol,347,0

Whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) triggered ADCC responses contributes to COVID-19 disease development is currently not well understood. To understand the potential correlation between ADCC responses and COVID-19 disease development, we analyzed the ADCC activity and neutralizing antibody response in 255 individuals ranging from asymptomatic to fatal infections over 1 year post disease. ADCC was elicited by 10 days post-infection, peaked by 11–20 days, and remained detectable until 400 days post-infection. In general, patients with severe disease had higher ADCC activities. Notably, patients who had severe disease and recovered had higher ADCC activities than patients who had severe disease and deceased. Importantly, ADCC activities were mediated by a diversity of epitopes in SARS-COV-2-infected mice and induced to comparable levels against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1) as that against the D614G mutant in human patients and vaccinated mice.

While a high portion of COVID-19 patients have mild symptoms, a limited number of clinical trials have evaluated the clinical course of this large group of patients. This study was designed to investigate the demographics and clinical characteristics and comorbidity of nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This prospective, observational cohort study was performed on nonhospitalized adult patients (≥18 years) with COVID-19. Pharmacotherapy service was responsible for patients' assessment for up to 1 month. Demographic characteristics, the onset of symptoms, severity, duration, laboratory data, and hospitalization rate were evaluated by a pharmacist-based monitoring program. RESULTS: From 323 patients who had been referred to the emergency department, 105 individuals were recruited between April 26 and August 2, 2020. Most of the patients were female (66.7%) with a mean age of 39.39 years (SD: ± 15.82). The mean time of the symptom onset was 5.6 days (SD: ±1.79). The majority of patients suffered from fatigue (78.1%), sore throat (67.6%), cough (60%), and myalgia (55.2%). C-reactive protein, white blood cell, lymphocyte, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and hemoglobin levels were recovered significantly during the first two weeks (P < 0.001). Hydroxychloroquine, naproxen, diphenhydramine, azithromycin, and vitamin D3 were the most common medications administered (98%, 96%, 94%, 68%, and 57%, respectively). Forty patients were not symptom-free after the one-month follow-up, and 8 patients (7.6%) were required to revisit without the need for hospitalization. Anosmia (18.1%) and fatigue (17.1%) were the most common persisted symptoms. There were no significant differences between symptom-free and symptomatic patients. CONCLUSION: Mild COVID-19 patients had a wide variety of symptoms and could be symptomatic even one month after the onset of symptoms. The pharmacist-based monitoring system can contribute beneficially to patients through the evaluation of symptoms, reduction of unnecessary visits, and provision of updated information to patients concerning the status of their illness.","Kasiri, Hossein; Mahjub, Cyrus; Mazaeri, Mohammadreza; Naderi-Behdani, Fahimeh; Bazi, Aliyeh; Ghazaeian, Monireh; Fallah, Sahar",Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol,347,3

METHODS: We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on COVID-19 patients published before 10(th) April 2020. Twenty-three studies containing data for 202,005 COVID-19 patients were identified and included in our study. Pooled effects of chronic comorbid conditions and CFR with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random-effects models. RESULTS: A median age of COVID-19 patients was 56.4 years and 55% of the patients were male. The most prevalent chronic comorbid conditions were: any type of chronic comorbidity (37%; 95% CI 32–41%), hypertension (22%; 95% CI 17–27%), diabetes (14%; 95% CI 12–17%), respiratory diseases (5%; 95% CI 3–6%), cardiovascular diseases (13%; 95% CI 10–16%) and other chronic diseases (e.g., cancer) (8%; 95% CI 6–10%). Furthermore, 37% of COVID-19 patients had at least one chronic comorbid condition, 28% of patients had two conditions, and 19% of patients had three or more chronic conditions. The overall pooled CFR was 7% (95% CI 6–7%). The crude CFRs increased significantly with increasing number of chronic comorbid conditions, ranging from 6% for at least one chronic comorbid condition to 13% for 2 or 3 chronic comorbid conditions, 12% for 4 chronic comorbid conditions, 14% for 5 chronic comorbid conditions, and 21% for 6 or more chronic comorbid conditions. Furthermore, the overall CFRs also significantly increased with higher levels of reported clinical symptoms, ranging from 14% for at least four symptoms, to 15% for 5 or 6 symptoms, and 21% for 7 or more symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The chronic comorbid conditions were identified as dominating risk factors, which should be considered in an emergency disease management and treatment choices.

However, findings available on its neurological manifestations and their pathogenic mechanisms have not yet been systematically addressed. A literature search on neurological complications reported in patients with COVID-19 until June 2020 produced a total of 23 studies. Overall, these papers report that patients may exhibit a wide range of neurological manifestations, including encephalopathy, encephalitis, seizures, cerebrovascular events, acute polyneuropathy, headache, hypogeusia, and hyposmia, as well as some non-specific symptoms. Whether these features can be an indirect and unspecific consequence of the pulmonary disease or a generalized inflammatory state on the CNS remains to be determined; also, they may rather reflect direct SARS-CoV-2-related neuronal damage. Hematogenous versus transsynaptic propagation, the role of the angiotensin II converting enzyme receptor-2, the spread across the blood-brain barrier, the impact of the hyperimmune response (the so-called “cytokine storm”), and the possibility of virus persistence within some CNS resident cells are still debated.

To further characterize the earliest apoptotic signaling events, here we treated cells with an antibody specific to the MHV receptor prior to and during virus infection or with an antibody specific to MHV spike protein following virus binding. Both treatments blocked virus infection and apoptosis, indicating that virus–receptor binding is necessary but not sufficient for the apoptosis induction. Furthermore, virus infection significantly increased the formation of the “death–receptor complexes” consisting of Fas, Fas-associated death domain and procaspase-8, but did not induce the complexes involving the tumor necrosis factor receptor and its associated death domain, demonstrating the specific activation of the Fas signaling pathway. Moreover, virus infection did not alter the abundance of the individual proteins of the complexes, suggesting that the activation of the Fas signaling pathway was at the post-translational level. Treatment with a Fas/Fc chimera, which blocks Fas-Fas ligand-mediated apoptosis, inhibited the formation of the complexes and blocked the activation of caspase-8 and apoptosis in MHV-infected cells. It also inhibited the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and the activation of caspase-9. These results demonstrate that oligodendrocyte apoptosis is triggered by MHV infection during cell entry through the activation of the Fas signaling pathway.","Liu, Yin; Zhang, Xuming",Virology,347,16

However, the use of cloth face mask in community has been recommended by the United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and regulatory bodies of other countries. There is paucity of literature on efficacy of cloth face mask in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission; thus, this review aims to update the available most recent evidences on efficacy of cloth face masks in prevention of viral infection transmission. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Clinical Trials Register for identifying studies related to this review using free-text terms and MeSH terms. Both experimental and observational studies on efficacy of cloth masks which were published in English language have been included in this review except expert opinions, commentaries, editorials, and review articles. Twelve studies were eligible to be included in review for data extraction and qualitative synthesis was carried out from extracted data but quantitative analysis (meta-analysis) could not be performed because of serious heterogeneity between the studies. RESULTS: Cloth face masks show minimum efficacy in source control than the medical grade mask. The efficacy of cloth face masks filtration varies and depends on the type of material used, number of layers, and degree of moisture in mask and fitting of mask on face. CONCLUSION: Cloth face masks have limited efficacy in combating viral infection transmission. However, it may be used in closed, crowded indoor, and outdoor public spaces involving physical proximity to prevent spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sharma, Suresh K.; Mishra, Mayank; Mudgal, Shiv K.",J Educ Health Promot,347,16

However, the clinical utility of postvaccination testing of antibody response and selection of targeted SARS-CoV-2 antigen(s) has not been established. The results of such testing from clinical teams independent from vaccine manufacturers are also limited. Here, we report the initial results of an ongoing clinical study on evaluation of antibody response to four different SARS-CoV-2 antigens after first and second dose of Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines and at later time points. We revealed a peak of antibody induction after the vaccine boosting dose with a gradual decline of antibody levels at later time. Anti-nucleocapsid antibody was not induced by spike protein-encoding vaccines and this may continue to serve as a marker of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. No differences between the two vaccines in terms of antibody response were revealed. Age and gender dependencies were determined to be minimal within the healthy adult (but not aged) population. Our results suggest that postvaccination testing of antibody response is an important and feasible tool for following people after vaccination and selecting individuals who might require a third dose of vaccine at an earlier time point or persons who may not need a second dose due to previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. IMPORTANCE Now that authorized vaccines for COVID-19 have been widely used, it is important to understand how they induce antivirus antibodies, which antigens are targeted, how long antibodies circulate, and how personal health conditions and age may affect this humoral immunity. Here, we report induction and time course of multiple anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in healthy individuals immunized with Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines. We also determined the age and gender dependence of the antibody response and compared antibody levels to responses seen in those who have recovered from COVID-19. Our results suggest the importance of screening for antibody response to multiple antigens after vaccination in order to reveal individuals who require early and late additional boosting and those who may not need second dose due to prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wheeler, Sarah E; Shurin, Galina V; Yost, Mary; Anderson, Adam; Pinto, Lisa; Wells, Alan; Shurin, Michael R",Microbiology spectrum,347,20

Agent-based modelling and simulation is rapidly increasing in its popularity, in part due to the increased appreciation of the paradigm by the non-computer science community, but also due to the increase in the usability, sophistication and number of modelling frameworks that use the approach. The Flexible Large-scale Agent-based Modelling Environment (FLAME) is a relatively recent addition to the list. FLAME was designed and developed from the outset to deal with massive simulations, and to ensure that the simulation code is portable across different scales of computing and across different operating systems. In this study, we report our experiences when using FLAME to model the development and propagation of conflict within large multi-partner enterprise system implementations, which acts as an example of a complex dynamical social system. We believe FLAME is an excellent choice for experienced modellers, who will be able to fully harness the capabilities that it has to offer, and also be competent in diagnosing and solving any limitations that are encountered. Conversely, because FLAME requires considerable development of instrumentation tools, along with development of statistical analysis scripts, we believe that it is not suitable for the novice modeller, who may be better suited to using a graphical user interface driven framework until their experience with modelling and competence in programming increases.","Williams, Richard A.",Simul Model Pract Theory,347,24

We assessed left ventricle (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) using speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) in COVID-19 recovered patients and its correlation with various parameters. METHODS A total of 134 subjects within 30-45 days post recovery from COVID-19 infection and normal LV ejection fraction were enrolled. Routine blood investigations, inflammatory markers (on admission) and comprehensive echocardiography including STE were done for all. RESULTS Of the 134 subjects, 121 (90.3%) were symptomatic during COVID-19 illness and were categorized as mild: 61 (45.5%), moderate: 50 (37.3%) and severe: 10 (7.5%) COVID-19 illness. Asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was reported in 13 (9.7%) patients. Subclinical LV and right ventricle (RV) dysfunction were seen in 40 (29.9%) and 14 (10.5%) patients, respectively. Impaired LVGLS was reported in 1 (7.7%), 8 (13.1%), 22 (44%) and 9 (90%) subjects with asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe disease, respectively. LVGLS was significantly lower in patients recovered from severe illness(mild: -21 ± 3.4%; moderate: -18.1 ± 6.9%; severe: -15.5 ± 3.1%; p < 0.0001). Subjects with reduced LVGLS had significantly higher interleukin-6 (p < 0.0001), C-reactive protein (p = 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.009), serum ferritin (p = 0.03), and troponin (p = 0.01) levels during index admission. CONCLUSIONS Subclinical LV dysfunction was seen in nearly a third of recovered COVID-19 patients while 10.5% had RV dysfunction. Our study suggests a need for closer follow-up among COVID-19 recovered subjects to elucidate long-term cardiovascular outcomes.","Mahajan, Sudhanshu; Kunal, Shekhar; Shah, Bhushan; Garg, Shobhit; Palleda, Girish M; Bansal, Ankit; Batra, Vishal; Yusuf, Jamal; Mukhopadhyay, Saibal; Kumar, Suresh; Tyagi, Sanjay; Gupta, Anubha; Gupta, Mohit D",Echocardiography,347,16

Therefore, design of DDoS attack detection system is on urge to mitigate these attacks for protecting the critical services. Nowadays, deep learning techniques are extensively used to detect these attacks. The existing deep feature learning approaches face the lacuna of designing an appropriate deep neural network structure for detection of DDoS attacks which leads to poor performance in terms of accuracy and false alarm. In this article, a tuned vector convolutional deep neural network (TVCDNN) is proposed by optimizing the structure and parameters of the deep neural network using binary and real cumulative incarnation (CuI), respectively. The CuI is a genetic-based optimization technique which optimizes the tuning process by providing values generated from best-fit parents. The TVCDNN is tested with publicly available benchmark network traffic datasets and compared with existing classifiers and optimization techniques. It is evident that the proposed optimization approach yields promising results compared to the existing optimization techniques. Further, the proposed approach achieves significant improvement in performance over the state-of-the-art attack detection systems.","Amma, N. G.

Social distancing is an important public health strategy for controlling the spread of the virus and minimizing its impact on the older adult population. It comes at a cost, however. Loneliness is associated with myriad adverse health outcomes, one of which is impaired immune functioning, which adds even greater risk for corona virus infection, complications and death. Older adults, therefore, are at compound risk, making effective management of loneliness and social isolation in our older patients a high priority target for preventive intervention. In this paper, we describe a cognitive-behavioral framework for social connectedness, including evidence-informed strategies clinicians can use to help patients develop a ‘Connections Plan’ to stay connected and promote their social, mental, and physical health during ‘social distancing’ restrictions. This set of strategies can be provided during brief (30 minute) telephone sessions and is analogous to creating a ‘Safety Plan’ for suicide risk. The approach is illustrated with three case examples.","Van Orden, Kimberly A.; Bower, Emily; Lutz, Julie; Silva, Caroline; Gallegos, Autumn M.; Podgorski, Carol A.; Santos, Elizabeth J.; Conwell, Yeates",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,347,1

Methods Forty-seven inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 had blood samples drawn on admission for assessing serum biomarkers of CNS injury by Single molecule array (Simoa), NfL and GFAp. Concentrations of NfL and GFAp were analyzed in relation to symptoms, clinical signs, inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes. We used multivariate linear models to test for differences in biomarker concentrations in the subgroups, accounting for confounding effects. Results In total, 21 % (n=10) of the patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, whereas the overall mortality rate was 13 % (n=6). Non-survivors had higher serum concentrations of NfL (p<0.001) than patients who were discharged alive both in adjusted analyses (p=2.6 x 10-7) and unadjusted analyses (p=0.001). The concentrations of NfL in non-survivors increased over repeated measurements whereas the concentrations in survivors were stable. Significantly higher concentrations of NfL were found in patients reporting fatigue, while reduced concentrations were found in patients experiencing cough, myalgia and joint pain. The GFAp concentration was also significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors (p=0.02). Conclusion Increased concentrations of NfL and GFAp in COVID-19 patients on admission may indicate increased mortality risk. Measurement of blood biomarkers for nervous system injury can be useful to detect and monitor CNS injury in COVID-19.","Aamodt, A. H.; Hogestol, E. A.; Popperud, T. H.; Holter, J.

However, several studies indicated negative impacts of lockdowns on the well-being and mental health of many people. In Austria, the first Covid-19-related lockdown was introduced on 16 March 2020 with most restrictions being lifted 1 month later. Seven months after that, in November 2020, the second full lockdown was implemented. The aim of this study was to compare the perceptions and experiences of the general population related to the first and second Covid-19 lockdowns in Austria. METHODS: Two waves of an online survey were conducted in May and December 2020 asking respondents about their concerns related to the Covid-19 illness, personal experiences of the lockdowns, perceptions of and compliance with imposed public health measures, and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on different aspects of life during the two lockdowns. Descriptive statistics including frequency analysis were used to compare respondents’ answers collected in the two waves of the survey. T-test and chi-square tests were used to test differences between the two lockdowns. RESULTS: Five hundred sixty participants were included in the first wave and a sub-sample of 134 participants in the second wave of data collection. During the second lockdown, study respondents were more concerned about their family members contracting Covid-19 when compared with the first lockdown. Compliance with public health measures was overall lower during the second lockdown, although it varied according to the type of the measure. Closure of schools was seen as the least essential restriction during the second lockdown, while wearing masks gained additional approval between the first and the second lockdown. Larger negative impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on friendships, leisure activities, education and community were reported during the second lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The study found that the extended duration of the pandemic and recurring lockdowns restricting freedom of movement and social contacts appear to have caused significant disruptions to many areas of life. Furthermore, declining adherence to most public health measures over time raises a question about the effectiveness of future lockdown measures.

Women who are overloaded with professional and family roles have high stress level, their indicators of psychological well-being and emotional level decrease when they have to give everyday care to their elderly parents. (2) Methods: The research sample has two empirical groups. Sample of Study 1 includes middle-aged women (n = 61) aged 38–56 (M = 48.1, SD = 3.5); sample of Study 2 includes middle-aged women (n = 85) aged 33–52 (M = 40.6, SD = 3.1): married (70.5%) and divorced (29.5%), having children of 14–28 years old; giving everyday care to elderly parents for more than 1.5 yrs.

(3) Results: A number of factors and indicators of women’s psycho-emotional health decrease in the situation of role overload have been identified. Among the factors there are four main types of women’s relationships with parents: Anxious closeness; Ambivalence of feelings; Secondary relationship with parents; Alienation, predicting of psycho-emotional health that are reducing or enhancing their personal resources. Besides, a type of separation of an adult woman from her mother predicts her level of well-being. (4) Conclusions: The study confirms that middle-aged Russian women’s psycho-emotional health depends on contextual factors (difficult role-overloaded lifestyle) and factors integrating women‘s relations towards parents, attachment, guilt and separation. Types of middle-aged women’s relationships with parents contribute to their psychoemotional health in a different way.","Saporovskaia, Maria V.; Kryukova, Tatiana L.; Voronina, Maria E.; Tikhomirova, Elena V.; Samokhvalova, Anna G.; Khazova, Svetlana A.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,347,6

We found that the distribution of Wuhan’s migrants is centred in Hubei Province (approximately 75%) at a provincial level, gradually decreasing in the surrounding provinces in layers, with obvious spatial characteristics of circle layers and echelons. The scale of Wuhan’s migrants, whose origins in Hubei Province give rise to a gradient reduction from east to west within the province, and account for 66% of Wuhan’s total migrants, are from the surrounding prefectural-level cities of Wuhan. The distribution comprises 94 districts and counties in Hubei Province, and the cumulative percentage of the top 30 districts and counties exceeds 80%. Wuhan’s migrants have a large proportion of middle-aged and high-risk individuals.

On 25 March 2020, Intercollegiate guidelines were published in the UK to promote safe surgical provision during the COVID-19 outbreak advocating non-operative management or avoidance of laparoscopy when surgery is essential. The effects of this on the investigation and management of appendicitis remain unknown. METHODS: We performed a multicentre, prospective, observational study from the start of the new guidelines to the 6th of May 2020. We included all patients referred to surgical teams with suspected appendicitis. A recent historical cohort was identified for comparison. The primary outcome was the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of non-operative management in appendicitis. Secondary outcomes included imaging, negative appendicectomy rate (NAR), length of stay (LOS) and 30-day complications. RESULTS: A total of 63/164 (38%) patients compared to 79/191 (41%) were diagnosed with appendicitis before and after the guidelines were introduced (p = 0.589). CT scanning increased (71/164 vs 105/191; p = 0.033) while ultrasound scanning decreased (71/164 vs 62/191; p = 0.037). Appendicitis was more likely to be managed non-operatively (11/63 vs 51/79; p < 0.001) and, of those managed surgically, with an open approach (3/52 vs 26/28 p < 0.001). The NAR also reduced (5/52 vs 0/28; p = 0.157). LOS was shorter in non-operatively managed patients (1 day vs 3 days; p < 0.001) without a difference in complications (10/51 vs 4/28; p = 0.760). CONCLUSION: Introduction of the guidelines was associated with changes in practice. Despite these changes, short-term complications did not increase and LOS decreased. Questions remain on the longer-term complication rates in non-operatively managed patients.

RESULTS: Of the 331 patients enrolled, only 225 met diagnostic criteria for IA as determined by the independent panel and received at least one dose of micafungin. Patients included 98/225 who had undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (88/98 allogeneic), 48 with graft versus host disease (GVHD), and 83/225 who had received chemotherapy for hematologic malignancy. A favorable response rate at the end of therapy was seen in 35.6% (80/225) of patients. Of those only treated with micafungin, favorable responses were seen in 6/12 (50%) of the primary and 9/22 (40.9%) of the salvage therapy group, with corresponding numbers in the combination treatment groups of 5/17 (29.4%) and 60/174 (34.5%) of the primary and salvage treatment groups, respectively. Of the 326 micafungin-treated patients, 183 (56.1%) died during therapy or in the 6-week follow-up phase; 107 (58.5%) deaths were attributable to IA. CONCLUSIONS: Micafungin as primary or salvage therapy proved efficacious and safe in high-risk patients with IA, although patient numbers are small in the micafungin-only groups.","Denning, David W.; Marr, Kieren A.; Lau, Wendi M.; Facklam, David P.; Ratanatharathorn, Voravit; Becker, Cornelia; Ullmann, Andrew J.; Seibel, Nita L.; Flynn, Patricia M.; van Burik, Jo-Anne H.; Buell, Donald N.; Patterson, Thomas F.",J Infect,347,16

Early anecdotal reports and limited in vitro data led to the significant uptake of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and to lesser extent chloroquine (CQ), for many patients with this disease. As an increasing number of patients with COVID‐19 are treated with these agents and more evidence accumulates, there continues to be no high‐quality clinical data showing a clear benefit of these agents for this disease. Moreover, these agents have the potential to cause harm, including a broad range of adverse events including serious cardiac side effects when combined with other agents. In addition, the known and potent immunomodulatory effects of these agents which support their use in the treatment of auto‐immune conditions, and provided a component in the original rationale for their use in patients with COVID‐19, may, in fact, undermine their utility in the context of the treatment of this respiratory viral infection. Specifically, the impact of HCQ on cytokine production and suppression of antigen presentation may have immunologic consequences that hamper innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses for patients with COVID‐19. Similarly, the reported in vitro inhibition of viral proliferation is largely derived from the blockade of viral fusion that initiates infection rather than the direct inhibition of viral replication as seen with nucleoside/tide analogs in other viral infections. Given these facts and the growing uncertainty about these agents for the treatment of COVID‐19, it is clear that at the very least thoughtful planning and data collection from randomized clinical trials are needed to understand what if any role these agents may have in this disease. In this article, we review the datasets that support or detract from the use of these agents for the treatment of COVID‐19 and render a data informed opinion that they should only be used with caution and in the context of carefully thought out clinical trials, or on a case‐by‐case basis after rigorous consideration of the risks and benefits of this therapeutic approach.","Meyerowitz, Eric A.; Vannier, Augustin G.

Here we report the clinical features of 66 hemodialysis patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 66 hemodialysis patients with confirmed COVID-19 from 1 January to 5 March 2020; the final date of follow-up was 25 March 2020. RESULTS: The clinical data were collected from 66 hemodialysis patients with confirmed COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 in our center was 11.0% (66/602), of which 18 patients died. According to different prognosis, hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 were divided into the survival and death group. A higher incidence of fever and dyspnea was found in the death group compared with the survival group. Meanwhile, patients in the death group were often accompanied by higher white blood cell count, prolonged PT time, increased D-dimer (p < .05). More patients in the death group showed hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes damage. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis suggested that fever, dyspnea, and elevated D-dimer were independent risk factors for death in hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 (OR, 1.077; 95% CI, 1.014 to 1.439; p = .044; OR, 1.146; 95% CI, 1.026 to 1.875; p = .034, OR, 4.974; 95% CI, 3.315 to 6.263; p = .007, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The potential risk factors of fever, dyspnea, and elevated D-dimer could help clinicians to identify hemodialysis patients with poor prognosis at an early stage of COVID-19 infection.","Zou, Rong; Chen, Fang; Chen, Dan; Xu, Cui-Ling; Xiong, Fei",Renal failure,347,20

Here we investigate vascular permeability in the context of SARS-CoV-2-mediated endotheliitis in patient samples and a vascular organoid model. We report the presence of the Spike glycoprotein in pericytes associated with pericyte activation and increased endothelial permeability in post-mortem COVID-19 lung autopsies. A pronounced decrease in the expression of the adhesion molecule VE-cadherin is observed in patients with thrombotic complications. Interestingly, fibrin-rich thrombi did not contain platelets, did not colocalize with tissue factor and have heterogenous levels of Von Willebrand factor, suggesting a biomarker-guided therapy might be required to target thrombosis in severe patients. Using a 3D vascular organoid model, we observe that ACE2 is primarily expressed in pericytes adjacent to vascular networks, consistent with patient data, indicating a preferential uptake of the S glycoprotein by these cells. Exposure of vascular organoids to SARS-CoV-2 or its antigens, recombinant trimeric Spike glycoprotein and Nucleocapsid protein, reduced endothelial cell and pericyte viability as well as CD144 expression with no additive effect upon endothelial activation via IL-1{beta}. Our data suggest that pericyte uptake of SARS-CoV-2 or Spike glycoprotein contributes to vasculopathy by altering endothelial permeability increasing the risk of thrombotic complications.","Khan, A.

The clinical use of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging in the assessment of inflammation and infection is increasing worldwide. The purpose of this paper is to achieve an Italian consensus document on [(18)F]FDG PET/CT or PET/MRI in inflammatory and infectious diseases, such as osteomyelitis (OM), prosthetic joint infections (PJI), infective endocarditis (IE), prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), cardiac implantable electronic device infections (CIEDI), systemic and cardiac sarcoidosis (SS/CS), diabetic foot (DF), fungal infections (FI), tuberculosis (TBC), fever and inflammation of unknown origin (FUO/IUO), pediatric infections (PI), inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), spine infections (SI), vascular graft infections (VGI), large vessel vasculitis (LVV), retroperitoneal fibrosis (RF) and COVID-19 infections. METHODS: In September 2020, the inflammatory and infectious diseases focus group (IIFG) of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine (AIMN) proposed to realize a procedural paper about the clinical applications of [(18)F]FDG PET/CT or PET/MRI in inflammatory and infectious diseases. The project was carried out thanks to the collaboration of 13 Italian nuclear medicine centers, with a consolidate experience in this field. With the endorsement of AIMN, IIFG contacted each center, and the pediatric diseases focus group (PDFC). IIFG provided for each team involved, a draft with essential information regarding the execution of [(18)F]FDG PET/CT or PET/MRI scan (i.e., indications, patient preparation, standard or specific acquisition modalities, interpretation criteria, reporting methods, pitfalls and artifacts), by limiting the literature research to the last 20 years. Moreover, some clinical cases were required from each center, to underline the teaching points. Time for the collection of each report was from October to December 2020. RESULTS: Overall, we summarized 291 scientific papers and guidelines published between 1998 and 2021. Papers were divided in several sub-topics and summarized in the following paragraphs: clinical indications, image interpretation criteria, future perspectivess and new trends (for each single disease), while patient preparation, image acquisition, possible pitfalls and reporting modalities were described afterwards. Moreover, a specific section was dedicated to pediatric and PET/MRI indications. A collection of images was described for each indication. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, [(18)F]FDG PET/CT in oncology is globally accepted and standardized in main diagnostic algorithms for neoplasms. In recent years, the ever-closer collaboration among different European associations has tried to overcome the absence of a standardization also in the field of inflammation and infections. The collaboration of several nuclear medicine centers with a long experience in this field, as well as among different AIMN focus groups represents a further attempt in this direction. We hope that this document will be the basis for a “common nuclear physicians’ language” throughout all the country.

This study explores at global scale whether the loss and gain of forest cover and the rise of oil palm plantations can promote outbreaks of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases. Taking into account the human population growth, we find that the increases in outbreaks of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases from 1990 to 2016 are linked with deforestation, mostly in tropical countries, and with reforestation, mostly in temperate countries. We also find that outbreaks of vector-borne diseases are associated with the increase in areas of palm oil plantations. Our study gives new support for a link between global deforestation and outbreaks of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases as well as evidences that reforestation and plantations may also contribute to epidemics of infectious diseases. The results are discussed in light of the importance of forests for biodiversity, livelihoods and human health and the need to urgently build an international governance framework to ensure the preservation of forests and the ecosystem services they provide, including the regulation of diseases. We develop recommendations to scientists, public health officers and policymakers who should reconcile the need to preserve biodiversity while taking into account the health risks posed by lack or mismanagement of forests.","Morand, Serge; Lajaunie, Claire",Front Vet Sci,347,17

Building on prior work examining emotions during times of crisis and changes that people undergo during major life transitions, as well as media accounts suggesting that employees have had positive and negative emotions tied to aspects of working during COVID-19, we adopt a person-centric view to examine profiles of monthly emotions regarding organizational reopening. Additionally, we consider how employees transition from one profile of emotions to another across months. In so doing, we consider whether feelings of hope, gratitude, fear, and resentment co-occur for employees; how employees transition across profiles from one month to the next as a function of perceptions of organizational leaders' trustworthiness and their handling of the COVID-19 crisis; and how changes in profile membership relate to employee well-being, work outcomes, and prevention behaviors to avoid contracting COVID-19. Using 1,422 total measurements from August 2020 to November 2020 from employees at a single university during two monthly transitions with significant crisis-related events (i.e., return to in-person teaching, students living on campus, announcement of pay cuts and furloughs, and the subsequent announcement that some of those conditions would change), we identified four profiles of monthly emotions, with perceived leader trustworthiness and handling of the pandemic being critical features of why employees belonged to different profiles between August-September and October-November. Further, we found implications of monthly transitions for work and COVID-related outcomes.

Here we describe a model designed to provide initial quantitative predictions of the risk of entry of such viruses to European Union (EU) Member States (MSs) through four routes: human travel, legal trade (e.g. fruit and animal products), live animal movements and illegal importation of bushmeat. The model utilises available datasets to assess the movement via these routes between individual countries of the world and EU MSs. These data are combined with virus specific data to assess the relative risk of entry between EU MSs. As a case study, the model was parameterised for NiV. Scenario analyses showed that the selection of exporting countries with NiV and potentially contaminated trade products were essential to the accuracy of all model outputs. Uncertainty analyses of other model parameters identified that the model expected number of years to an introduction event within the EU was highly susceptible to the prevalence of NiV in bats. The relative rankings of the MSs and routes, however, were more robust. The UK, the Netherlands and Germany were consistently the most likely points of entry and the ranking of most MSs varied by no more than three places (maximum variation five places). Legal trade was consistently the most likely route of entry, only falling below human travel when the estimate of the prevalence of NiV in bats was particularly low. Any model-based calculation is dependent on the data available to feed into the model and there are distinct gaps in our knowledge, particularly in regard to various pathogen/virus as well as host/bat characteristics. However, the strengths of this model lie in the provision of relative comparisons of risk among routes and MSs. The potential for expansion of the model to include other routes and viruses and the possibility of rapid parameterisation demonstrates its potential for use in an outbreak situation.","Simons, Robin R.

Here we show that adoptive transfer of purified IgG from convalescent macaques protects naïve recipient rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a dose dependent fashion. Depletion of CD8+ T cells in convalescent animals partially abrogated the protective efficacy of natural immunity against SARS-CoV-2 re-challenge, suggesting the importance of cellular immunity in the context of waning or subprotective antibody titers. These data demonstrate that relatively low antibody titers are sufficient for protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques, and that cellular immune responses may also contribute to protection if antibody responses are suboptimal. We also show that higher antibody titers are required for therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques.
