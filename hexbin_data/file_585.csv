854,Discriminating Active from Latent Tuberculosis in Patients Presenting to Community Clinics,2012-05-30,"BACKGROUND: Because of the high global prevalence of latent TB infection (LTBI), a key challenge in endemic settings is distinguishing patients with active TB from patients with overlapping clinical symptoms without active TB but with co-existing LTBI. Current methods are insufficiently accurate. Plasma proteomic fingerprinting can resolve this difficulty by providing a molecular snapshot defining disease state that can be used to develop point-of-care diagnostics. METHODS: Plasma and clinical data were obtained prospectively from patients attending community TB clinics in Peru and from household contacts. Plasma was subjected to high-throughput proteomic profiling by mass spectrometry. Statistical pattern recognition methods were used to define mass spectral patterns that distinguished patients with active TB from symptomatic controls with or without LTBI. RESULTS: 156 patients with active TB and 110 symptomatic controls (patients with respiratory symptoms without active TB) were investigated. Active TB patients were distinguishable from undifferentiated symptomatic controls with accuracy of 87% (sensitivity 84%, specificity 90%), from symptomatic controls with LTBI (accuracy of 87%, sensitivity 89%, specificity 82%) and from symptomatic controls without LTBI (accuracy 90%, sensitivity 90%, specificity 92%). CONCLUSIONS: We show that active TB can be distinguished accurately from LTBI in symptomatic clinic attenders using a plasma proteomic fingerprint. Translation of biomarkers derived from this study into a robust and affordable point-of-care format will have significant implications for recognition and control of active TB in high prevalence settings.","Sandhu, Gurjinder; Battaglia, Francesca; Ely, Barry K.; Athanasakis, Dimitrios; Montoya, Rosario; Valencia, Teresa; Gilman, Robert H.; Evans, Carlton A.; Friedland, Jon S.; Fernandez-Reyes, Delmiro; Agranoff, Daniel D.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3364185/,585

11729,COVID-19 and changing social norms,2020-05-04,"Many blood donation services around the globe maintain large archives of serum and/or plasma specimens of blood donations which could potentially be used for serologic surveillance and risk assessment of influenza. Harnessing this potential requires robust evidence that the outcomes of influenza serology in plasma, which is rarely used, is consistent with that in serum, which is the conventional choice of specimens for influenza serology. We harvested EDTA-plasma specimens from the blood donation archives of Hong Kong Red Cross Transfusion Services, where EDTA is the type of anticoagulant used for plasma collection, compared their antibody titers and responses to that in serum. Influenza A/H1N1/California/7/2009 and A/H3N2/Victoria/208/2009 were the test strains. Our results showed that antibody titers in 609 matched serum/EDTA-plasma specimens (i.e. obtained from the same donor at the same time) had good agreement inferred by Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, the value of which was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.77–0.86) for hemagglutination inhibition assay and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93–0.96) for microneutralization assay; seroconversion rates (based on hemagglutination inhibition titers) during the 2010 and 2011 influenza seasons in Hong Kong inferred from paired EDTA-plasma were similar to that inferred from paired sera. Our study provided the proof-of-concept that blood donation archives could be leveraged as a valuable source of longitudinal blood specimens for the surveillance, control and risk assessment of both pandemic and seasonal influenza.","Zhang, Yanyu; Leung, Kathy; Perera, Ranawaka A.

Few data are available on the immunogenicity of repeated annual doses of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09-containing vaccines. Methods. We enrolled healthcare personnel (HCP) in direct patient care during the autumn of 2010 at 2 centers with voluntary immunization. We verified the receipt of A(H1N1)pdm09-containing monovalent inactivated influenza vaccine (MIIV) and 2010–2011 trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV). We performed hemagglutination inhibition antibody (HI) assays on preseason, post-TIV, and end-of-season serum samples. We compared the proportion of HCPs with HI titer ≥40 against A(H1N1)pdm09 per receipt of prior-season MIIV, current-season TIV, both, or neither. Results. At preseason (n = 1417), HI ≥ 40 was significantly higher among those who received MIIV (34%) vs those who did not (14%) (adjusted relative risk [ARR], 3.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.72–3.81). At post-TIV (n = 865), HI ≥ 40 was lower among HCP who received MIIV and TIV (66%) than among those receiving only TIV (85%) (ARR, 0.93 [95% CI, .84–.997]). At end-of-season (n = 1254), HI ≥ 40 was 40% among those who received both MIIV and TIV and 67% among those receiving only TIV (ARR, 0.76 [95% CI, .65–.88]), 52% among those who received MIIV only, and 12% among those receiving neither. Conclusions. HCP immunization programs should consider effects of host immune response and vaccine antigenic distance on immunogenicity of repeated annual doses of influenza vaccines.","Gaglani, Manjusha; Spencer, Sarah; Ball, Sarah; Song, Juhee; Naleway, Allison; Henkle, Emily; Bozeman, Sam; Reynolds, Sue; Sessions, Wendy; Hancock, Kathy; Thompson, Mark",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7313942/,585
11903,Reassessing the Global Mortality Burden of the 1918 Influenza Pandemic,2018-09-07,"Background. Persons with influenza can develop complications that result in hospitalization and death. These are most commonly respiratory related, but cardiovascular or neurologic complications or exacerbations of underlying chronic medical conditions may also occur. Patterns of complications observed during pandemics may differ from typical influenza seasons, and characterizing variations in influenza-related complications can provide a better understanding of the impact of pandemics and guide appropriate clinical management and planning for the future. Methods. Using a population-based surveillance system, we compared clinical complications using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) discharge diagnosis codes in adults hospitalized with seasonal influenza (n = 5270) or 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (H1N1pdm09; n = 4962). Results. Adults hospitalized with H1N1pdm09 were younger (median age, 47 years) than those with seasonal influenza (median age, 68 years; P < .01), and differed in the frequency of certain underlying medical conditions. Whereas there was similar risk for many influenza-associated complications, after controlling for age and type of underlying medical condition, adults hospitalized with H1N1pdm09 were more likely to have lower respiratory tract complications, shock/sepsis, and organ failure than those with seasonal influenza. They were also more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit, require mechanical ventilation, or die. Young adults, in particular, had 2–4 times the risk of severe outcomes from H1N1pdm09 than persons of the same ages with seasonal influenza. Conclusions. Although H1N1pdm09 was thought of as a relatively mild pandemic, these data highlight the impact of the 2009 pandemic on the risk of severe influenza, especially among younger adults, and the impact this virus may continue to have.","Reed, Carrie; Chaves, Sandra S.; Perez, Alejandro; D'Mello, Tiffany; Daily Kirley, Pamala; Aragon, Deborah; Meek, James I.; Farley, Monica M.; Ryan, Patricia; Lynfield, Ruth; Morin, Craig A.; Hancock, Emily B.; Bennett, Nancy M.; Zansky, Shelley M.; Thomas, Ann; Lindegren, Mary Louise; Schaffner, William; Finelli, Lyn",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314251/,585

Although some scholars have found that social factors were important, others have not. In this study, we analyzed differences in excess mortality by social class in Sweden during the 1918 pandemic. We analyzed individual-level mortality of the entire population aged 30–59 years by combining information from death records with census data on occupation. Social class was measured by an occupation-based class scheme. Excess mortality during the pandemic was measured as the number of deaths relative to the number occurring in the same month the year before. Social class differences in numbers of deaths were modeled using a complementary log-log model that was adjusted for potential confounding at the family, the residential (urban/rural), and the county levels. We found notable class differences in excess mortality but no perfect class gradient. Class differences were somewhat larger for men than for women.","Bengtsson, Tommy; Dribe, Martin; Eriksson, Björn",Am J Epidemiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314276/,585

Typical ciliopathies include Bardet–Biedl syndrome (BBS), nephronophthisis (NPHP), Jeune, Joubert, oro-facial-digital (OFD1) and Meckel (MKS) syndromes. All ciliopathies have the common denominator of renal disease, often including tubular cysts. In this study, we have modelled a range of ciliopathies in zebrafish and shown in all cases that knocking down these genes causes cystic lesions in the kidney. We have identified two drugs, rapamycin and roscovitine, which ameliorate the renal phenotype, both morphologically and functionally. This is the first study in which zebrafish has been used to identify potential therapeutic modalities for ciliopathic renal disease, and the results pave the way for further investigations in mammalian models.","Tobin, Jonathan L.; Beales, Philip L.",Pediatr Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7462901/,585

Correlation between the abdominal wall’s thickness (AWTh) and IAP has been reported previously. The abdominal wall can be modeled as a compound of parallel dielectric slabs; changes in their width have a direct effect on the reflection coefficient of the abdominal wall at microwave frequencies. This work describes the design of a reflectometry system and its proof-of-concept trial on five patients during laparoscopic surgery. The system complies with IEEE Std. C95.1-2005 concerning exposure of humans to microwave electromagnetic fields in controlled environments. The results putatively show an inverse correlation between IAP and the reflection coefficient, and a strong dependence on the body mass index. A better understanding of the dynamics in the changes of the AWTh (during intra-abdominal hypertension) will allow further development of a microwave-based technique for the continuous non-invasive indirect monitoring of IAP in critical patients.","David, Marcelo; Raviv, Aviad; Guttel, Ariel; García Reyes, Valentina; Simini, Franco; Pracca, Francisco",J Clin Monit Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7556589/,585
13410,Reflections on a Patient Suicide in the Time of COVID-19,2020-10-23,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: In recent years, immunotherapy has emerged as a pillar in the fight against cancer. However, the heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment poses challenges to the efficacy of immunotherapy treatment strategies and may contribute to treatment resistance, progression and relapse. Hence, researchers have used transcriptional spatial profiling techniques to uncover the complex cancer immune profile while retaining critical spatial information of different cell types. This would help identify the source of tumor heterogeneity and uncover pathogenic mechanisms, potential drug targets and novel biomarkers. In this review, we discuss various approaches for transcriptional spatial profiling of cancer tissues such as in situ hybridization, digital spatial profiling and an emerging technology known as Visium Spatial Gene Expression Solution. We highlight the strengths and limitations of the different technologies and the potential and promise they hold in the advancement of cancer immunotherapy. ABSTRACT: Intratumoral heterogeneity poses a major challenge to making an accurate diagnosis and establishing personalized treatment strategies for cancer patients. Moreover, this heterogeneity might underlie treatment resistance, disease progression, and cancer relapse. For example, while immunotherapies can confer a high success rate, selective pressures coupled with dynamic evolution within a tumour can drive the emergence of drug-resistant clones that allow tumours to persist in certain patients. To improve immunotherapy efficacy, researchers have used transcriptional spatial profiling techniques to identify and subsequently block the source of tumour heterogeneity. In this review, we describe and assess the different technologies available for such profiling within a cancer tissue. We first outline two well-known approaches, in situ hybridization and digital spatial profiling. Then, we highlight the features of an emerging technology known as Visium Spatial Gene Expression Solution. Visium generates quantitative gene expression data and maps them to the tissue architecture. By retaining spatial information, we are well positioned to identify novel biomarkers and perform computational analyses that might inform on novel combinatorial immunotherapies.","Nerurkar, Sanjna Nilesh; Goh, Denise; Cheung, Chun Chau Lawrence; Nga, Pei Qi Yvonne; Lim, Jeffrey Chun Tatt; Yeong, Joe Poh Sheng",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7563386/,585

These two quality control sensors control lectin chaperone binding and glycoprotein egress from the ER. A quantitative glycoproteomics strategy was deployed to identify cellular substrates of the UGGTs at endogenous levels in CRISPR-edited HEK293 cells. The 71 UGGT substrates identified were mainly large multidomain and heavily glycosylated proteins when compared to the general N-glycoproteome. UGGT1 was the dominant glucosyltransferase with a preference toward large plasma membrane proteins whereas UGGT2 favored the modification of smaller, soluble lysosomal proteins. This study sheds light on differential specificities and roles of UGGT1 and UGGT2 and provides insight into the cellular reliance on the carbohydrate-dependent chaperone system to facilitate proper folding and maturation of the cellular N-glycoproteome.","Adams, Benjamin M; Canniff, Nathan P; Guay, Kevin P; Larsen, Ida Signe Bohse; Hebert, Daniel N",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7771966/,585

Genetically modified influenza viruses have a unique advantage when researching the transmission and pathogenicity of influenza. With the continuous development of oncolytic viruses in recent years, studies have found that influenza viruses also have certain oncolytic activity. Influenza viruses can specifically recognize tumor cells; activate cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, etc.; and stimulate the body to produce an immune response, thereby killing tumor cells.

21889,Design and user experience testing of a polygenic score report: a qualitative study of prospective users,2021-10-01,"BACKGROUND: Recent approvals for novel agents such as the small molecule Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi), combined with the advent of biosimilars has widened the gamut of available therapeutic options in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This combined with the introduction of mandatory non- medical switches to biosimilars in some jurisdictions by both public and private payors has led to a significant increase in the volume of therapeutic changes for patients. Pharmacists are well positioned to ensure effective and safe transitions, however there is a significant unmet need for objective and subjective clinical guidance around therapy as well disease state monitoring in RA that facilitates best practices throughout the patient journey. OBJECTIVE: In this paper we aim to create a consensus derived monitoring algorithm for pharmacists to facilitate best practices throughout therapeutic transitions from originator biologic to other originator biologics, biosimilars, and Janus kinase inhibitors in RA. METHODS: The Nominal Group Technique (NGT) was used to understand if consensus could be found among the participants. Clinically relevant questions were developed to capture solutions to the identified unmet need. The faculty considered the questions as individuals, and privately generated answers/ideas. After discussion and consideration, the participants ranked the ideas and established a consensus. RESULTS: Based on the outcome of the consensus discussions, an algorithm was created to help guide pharmacists through therapeutic transitions in RA. The tool covers important topics such as pre-transition considerations, avoiding the nocebo effect for biosimilars, specific considerations for each drug or class, monitoring efficacy, and when to refer. CONCLUSIONS: New classes of anti-rheumatic drugs including JAKi, along with the introduction of biosimilars are presenting more opportunity for therapeutic changes and monitoring in patients with RA. We hope our evidence-based consensus derived guidance tool will assist frontline pharmacists in supporting their patients to a successful therapeutic transition in RA.","Choquette, Denis; Chan, Jonathan; Bardi, Mohammad; Whiskin, Carolyn; Torani, Gabriel; Smith, Brennan K.; Sihota, Aaron",Pharm Pract (Granada),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8455126/,585

As viruses have no ribosomes, mitochondria, or other organelles, they are completely dependent on their cellular hosts for energy production and protein synthesis. They replicate only within cells of the host that they infect. Unlike any microorganism, many viruses can, in suitable cells, reproduce themselves from their genome, a single nucleic acid molecule, that is, their nucleic acid alone is infectious. Outside a susceptible cell, the virus particle like a bacterial spore is metabolically inert; on the other hand, when replicating in a cell, it exhibits all the characteristics of life. The new group of microorganisms are known as the filterable viruses. The filtration studies has shown that virus particles (virions) range from about the size of the smallest unicellular microorganisms (300 nm) down to objects little bigger than the largest protein molecules (20 nm). In the simpler viruses, the virion consists of a single molecule of nucleic acid surrounded by a protein coat, the capsid; the capsid and its enclosed nucleic acid together constitute the nucleocapsid.","FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

Through a review of existing literature at the nexus of urbanisation and infectious disease, we consider how this (potential) increased vulnerability to infectious diseases in peri- or suburban areas is in fact dialectically related to socio-material transformations on the metropolitan edge. In particular, we highlight three key factors influencing the spread of infectious disease that have been identified in the literature: demographic change, infrastructure and governance. These have been chosen given both the prominence of these themes and their role in shaping the spread of disease on the urban edge. Further, we suggest how a landscape political ecology framework can be useful for examining the role of socio-ecological transformations in generating increased risk of infectious disease in peri- and suburban areas. To illustrate our arguments we will draw upon examples from various re-emerging infectious disease events and outbreaks around the world to reveal how extended urbanisation in the broadest sense has amplified the conditions necessary for the spread of infectious diseases. We thus call for future research on the spatialities of health and disease to pay attention to how variegated patterns of extended urbanisation may influence possible outbreaks and the mechanisms through which such risks can be alleviated.","Connolly, Creighton; Keil, Roger; Ali, S.

Unfortunately, many XML documents in practice are not accompanied by a schema or a valid schema. Therefore, it is essential to devise algorithms to infer schemas. The fundamental task in XML schema inference is to learn regular expressions.

Previous work in this direction lacks inference algorithms that support inference from positive and negative examples. We provide an algorithm to learn SIREs from positive and negative examples based on genetic algorithms and parallel techniques. Our algorithm also has better expansibility, which means that our algorithm not only supports learning with positive and negative examples, but also supports learning with positive or negative examples only. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.","Li, Yeting; Chen, Haiming; Zhang, Lingqi; Huang, Bo; Zhang, Jianzhao",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206278/,585

The difficulty is to make a prediction that optimises the reward obtained from the original contribution; this is even more important when investments are the core service offered by a business or pension fund generated by monthly contributions. The complexity of finance is that the human predictor may have other interests or bias than the human investor, the trust between predictor and investor will never be completely established as the investor will never know if the predictor has generated, intentionally or unintentionally, the optimum possible reward. This paper presents the Random Neural Network in recurrent configuration that makes predictions on time series data, specifically, prices. The biological model inspired by the brain structure and neural interconnections makes predictions entirely on previous data from the time series rather than predictions based on several uncorrelated inputs. The model is validated against the property, stock and Fintech market: 1) UK property prices, 2) stock markets indice prices, 3) cryptocurrency prices.

Even for applications with extremely regular and homogeneous compute-communicate phases, simply adding communication time to computation time does often not yield a satisfactory prediction of parallel runtime due to deviations from the expected simple lockstep pattern caused by system noise, variations in communication time, and inherent load imbalance. In this paper, we highlight the specific cases of provoked and spontaneous desynchronization of memory-bound, bulk-synchronous pure MPI and hybrid MPI+OpenMP programs. Using simple microbenchmarks we observe that although desynchronization can introduce increased waiting time per process, it does not necessarily cause lower resource utilization but can lead to an increase in available bandwidth per core. In case of significant communication overhead, even natural noise can shove the system into a state of automatic overlap of communication and computation, improving the overall time to solution. The saturation point, i.e., the number of processes per memory domain required to achieve full memory bandwidth, is pivotal in the dynamics of this process and the emerging stable wave pattern. We also demonstrate how hybrid MPI-OpenMP programming can prevent desirable desynchronization by eliminating the bandwidth bottleneck among processes. A Chebyshev filter diagonalization application is used to demonstrate some of the observed effects in a realistic setting.","Afzal, Ayesha; Hager, Georg; Wellein, Gerhard",High Performance Computing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7295361/,585
34642,Male mortality and the German response: lessons from COVID‐19,2020-06-04,"HPC has undergone a significant transition toward heterogeneous architectures. This transition has introduced several issues in code migration to support multiple frameworks for targeting the various architectures. In order to cope with these challenges, projects such as Kokkos and LLVM create abstractions which map a generic front-end API to the backend that supports the targeted architecture. This paper presents a complementary framework for performance measurement and analysis. Several performance measurement and analysis tools in existence provide their capabilities through various methods but the common theme among these tools are prohibitive limitations in terms of user-level extensions. For this reason, software developers commonly have to learn multiple tools and valuable analysis methods, such as the roofline model, are frequently required to be generated manually. The timemory framework provides complete modularity for performance measurement and analysis and eliminates all restrictions on user-level extensions. The timemory framework also provides a highly-efficient and intuitive method for handling multiple tools/measurements (i.e., “components”) concurrently. The intersection of these characteristics provide ample evidence that timemory can serve as the common interface for existing performance measurement and analysis tools. Timemory components are developed in C++ but includes multi-language support for C, Fortran, and Python codes. Numerous components are provided by the library itself – including, but not limited to, timers, memory usage, hardware counters, and FLOP and instruction roofline models. Additionally, analysis of the intrinsic overhead demonstrates superior performance in comparison with popular tools.","Madsen, Jonathan R.; Awan, Muaaz G.; Brunie, Hugo; Deslippe, Jack; Gayatri, Rahul; Oliker, Leonid; Wang, Yunsong; Yang, Charlene; Williams, Samuel",High Performance Computing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7295383/,585

Prior research has developed methods for predicting learner dropout but primarily for adults in formal courses and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), not for children’s voluntary ed tech usage. To support early literacy in rural contexts, our research group developed and deployed a phone-based literacy technology with rural families in Côte d’Ivoire in two longitudinal studies. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using time-series classification models trained on system log data to predict gaps in children’s voluntary usage of our system in both studies. We contribute insights around important features associated with sustained system usage, such as children’s patterns of use, performance on the platform, and involvement from other adults in their family. Finally, we contribute design implications for predicting and supporting learners’ voluntary, out-of-school usage of mobile learning applications in rural contexts.","Chatterjee, Rishabh; Madaio, Michael; Ogan, Amy",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334192/,585

To best of our insight, there is no approach for solving PNLP problem. For the first time, we take up the PNLP problem where the objectives, constraints are considered as pentagonal neutrosophic numbers (PNN). To deign our algorithm, we described the PN arithmetic operation laws and mathematical computation in PNN environment. This proposed method is based on ranking function and convert to its equivalent crisp LP (CrLP) problem. The obtained CrLP issue is presently being tackled by any LP method which is effectively accessible.

In spite of its strengths, the reliance of the Alloy Analyzer on computationally heavy solvers means that it can take a significant amount of time to verify software properties, even within limited bounds. This challenge is exacerbated by the ever-evolving nature of complex software systems. This paper presents Platinum, a technique for efficient analysis of evolving Alloy specifications, that recognizes opportunities for constraint reduction and reuse of previously identified constraint solutions. The insight behind Platinum is that formula constraints recur often during the analysis of a single specification and across its revisions, and constraint solutions can be reused over sequences of analyses performed on evolving specifications. Our empirical results show that Platinum substantially reduces (by 66.4% on average) the analysis time required on specifications extracted from real-world software systems.","Zheng, Guolong; Bagheri, Hamid; Rothermel, Gregg; Wang, Jianghao",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7418126/,585

For this, the Easter week of 2020 was separated when a comparative operation of Bolsonaro with the figure of Jesus Christ, in his social networks—a tip of what we call Brazilian Christofascism—was woven. Thus, precisely in the period of the celebration of the death and resurrection of the Christian Messiah, we sought to connect Bolsonaro with the figure of Jesus, placing him as the country’s savior in the posts on his social networks. For this demonstration we assume that each post would be a “scene,” which are “politically staged dramatic acts” (Rancière), in this case, media scenes. Therefore, we argue that during the period, the intellectuals of the Bolsonaro government designed seven scenes to readjust the presidential figure to Christianity for its loss of popularity for the public defense of vertical isolation.","Py, Fábio",Int J Lat Am Relig,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7521570/,585

It takes its direction of travel from artist Brian Jungen’s ‘Cetology’ (2002), a whalebone sculpture made out of cut-up plastic garden chairs, which conjoins the times of earth and world history, as it hangs in the air of the art gallery, ‘as if’ exhibited in the natural history museum. The paper relates ‘Cetology’s’ engagement with natural history, time, and commodification to matters of corporate entanglement and responsibility within company law and governance. Problems with understanding the comparable imprint of large and multinational companies on matters, places, and communities are identified, after the domination of corporate legal frameworks over nature and the stability and perfection of economic incentives at law. The reading of this (critical-legal) situation is developed through theory and engagement with materialist and critical thinkers, who unite in their concern with distributed human–nature relations and the ‘concreteness’ that attends collisions in time, ruin and affect. Walter Benjamin and Theodor Adorno’s writings are central to this analysis, and strengthen the commentary on ‘natural history’ themes curated by Jungen. The paper contemplates how times’ uncontainment might invoke a change in expectation and method for the company law field, assigning contingency to the corporation and provoking a new mode of reflection about corporate entanglement and responsibility at law.","Moncrieff, Lilian",Law Critique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7575699/,585

In turn, graphs gained a lot of attention due to their modeling capabilities for several real-world phenomena ranging from bioinformatics to social network analysis. However, the attention has been recently moved towards hypergraphs, generalization of plain graphs where multi-way relations (other than pairwise relations) can be considered. In this paper, four (hyper)graph kernels are proposed and their efficiency and effectiveness are compared in a twofold fashion. First, by inferring the simplicial complexes on the top of underlying graphs and by performing a comparison among 18 benchmark datasets against state-of-the-art approaches; second, by facing a real-world case study (i.e., metabolic pathways classification) where input data are natively represented by hypergraphs. With this work, we aim at fostering the extension of graph kernels towards hypergraphs and, more in general, bridging the gap between structural pattern recognition and the domain of hypergraphs.","Martino, Alessio; Rizzi, Antonello",Entropy (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7597323/,585

In PGIMER, Chandigarh, health education materials in text and video formats have been uploaded on the PGIMER website for empowering patients. All these have been successfully tested in the outpatient departments of PGIMER, Chandigarh. To our knowledge, this unique approach is the first of its kind in India.

42232,Sensemaking in the Time of COVID‐19,2020-11-17,"China has emerged as a champion of economic globalization, particularly through building global supply chains, financing overseas infrastructure and energy projects, and exporting labour to developing countries throughout the world. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), announced in 2013, is a keystone in China’s economic globalization. The BRI emphasizes connectivity: policy, infrastructure, trade, financial, and ‘people-to-people’. Despite the broad significance of Chinese economic globalization, its legal dimensions are still poorly understood. China, Law and Development (CLD) is an international and multi-disciplinary research project that aims to study the legal and regulatory aspects of this stage of globalization. This symposium is comprised of articles by CLD research associates who investigate various questions, including labour rights, skilled migration facilitation, investment review, multilateralism, and patronage and clientelism. This article introduces the symposium, and it does so through the example of China’s role in global health governance. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) epidemic in late 2019 in China, which has since become a worldwide pandemic, has obstructed BRI connectivity through delinking global supply chains, blocking labour migration, freezing markets, and exacerbating Sinophobia. In response, China has sought to lead an effort in improving global health governance through participation in international organizations and strengthening its bilateral ties through health aid and technology export. The coronavirus pandemic may offer the Chinese an opportunity to lead a more circumscribed re-globalization, although China faces significant challenges.","Erie, Matthew S",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7665407/,585

We evaluate the rates of influenza vaccination among HCWs and factors influencing uptake among health care professional groups in a children’s hospital in Ankara, Turkey. We surveyed 108 HCWs using a self-administered questionnaire. Influenza vaccination coverage rates (VCR) among HCWs for at least one dose in their lifetimes was 60.2%. In the 2016–2017 influenza season, VCR of HCWs was 14.8%. We found a significantly higher rate of vaccinated participants among physicians (83.3%), older HCWs (mean age ± SD, 36.2 ± 7.7 year), HCWs who believed in the necessity for vaccination (79.5%), and HCWs who have worked for a longer time (> 5 years) in the health care profession (71.2%) (p = 0.023, p = 0.002, p = 0.001, p = 0.003 respectively).

The distribution of the pandemic-induced job losses for women and men or for different racial/ethnic categories has been studied in the recent literature. We contribute to this literature by providing an intersectional analysis of unemployment under COVID-19, where we examine the differences in the likelihood of unemployment across groups of White men, White women, Black men, Black women, Hispanic men, and Hispanic women. As a case of study of the COVID-19 recession, our work engages with the broader empirical literature testing the discrimination theories based on the unexplained gap after accounting for observable characteristics of women, men, and different races/ethnicities and their labor market positions. Controlling for individual characteristics such as education and age, as well as industry and occupation effects, we show that women of all three racial/ethnic categories are more likely to be unemployed compared to men, yet there are substantial differences across these groups based on different unemployment measures. Hispanic women have the highest likelihood of being unemployed, followed by Black women, who are still more likely to be unemployed than White women. We also examine if the ability to work from home has benefited any particular group in terms of lowering their likelihood of unemployment during the pandemic. We find that in industries with a high degree of teleworkable jobs, White women, Black men, and Hispanic men are no longer more likely to be unemployed relative to White men. However, Black women and Hispanic Women still experience a significantly higher probability of job loss compared to White men even if they are employed in industries with highly teleworkable jobs. As we control for both individual and aggregate factors, our results suggest that these differences are not simply the result of overrepresentation of women of color in certain industries and occupations; rather, unobservable factors such as discrimination could be at work.","Gezici, Armagan; Ozay, Ozge",J Econ Race Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7735953/,585

Here, we summarize and critically discuss recent advances on the mechanisms of allosteric partial agonists for three representative signalling enzymes activated by cyclic nucleotides: the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), and the exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC). The comparative analysis of partial agonism in PKA, PKG and EPAC reveals a common emerging theme, i.e. the sampling of distinct “mixed” conformational states, either within a single domain or between distinct domains. Here, we show how such “mixed” states play a crucial role in explaining the observed functional response, i.e. partial agonism and allosteric pluripotency, as well as in maximizing inhibition while minimizing potency losses. In addition, by combining Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and Ensemble Allosteric Modeling (EAM), we also show how to map the free-energy landscape of conformational ensembles containing “mixed” states. By discussing selected case studies, we illustrate how MD simulations and EAM complement NMR to quantitatively relate protein dynamics to function. The resulting NMR- and MD-based EAMs are anticipated to inform not only the design of new generations of highly selective allosteric inhibitors, but also the choice of multidrug combinations.","Byun, Jung Ah; VanSchouwen, Bryan; Akimoto, Madoka; Melacini, Giuseppe",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7720024/,585

The effects of this interaction of sex and gender are shown to be separate from the effects of partisanship. While partisanship is a significant driver of attitudes about face masks, within partisan groups, men who report “completely” masculine gender identities are very different from their fellow partisans.","Cassino, Dan; Besen-Cassino, Yasemin",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7853746/,585

Since PPROM is likely to be associated with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC)—either before or secondary to PPROM—the risk of developing intraamniotic inflammation (IAI) is high. IAI is associated with short latency to delivery and with adverse short- and long-term outcomes for the newborn, especially in cases of fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS). Prediction of IAI based on maternal parameters is difficult or impossible. The recently established definition of triple I (“infection, inflammation, or both”) is based on the parameter “maternal body temperature”. If this is increased to ≥ 38.0 °C and there is no other reason to explain maternal fever, the finding is suspicious for triple I if at least one other of the following parameters can be found: fetal tachycardia > 160 bpm for at least 10 min, maternal leukocytes > 15,000/µl without administration of corticosteroids, or purulent fluid from the cervical os. Pregnancies suspicious for triple I should be terminated. The confirmation of triple I is only possible by placental histology (histologically confirmed chorioamnionitis, HCA). Confirmation based on amniocentesis (positive Gram stain, low glucose concentration [<14 mg/dl], elevated white blood cell count [>30 cells/mm(3)], positive culture) takes too long and is unreliable. Serial determinations of C‑reactive protein also do not allow reliable diagnosis of IAI.

The aim of this article is to design a prototype robot that can deliver food and medical trays to COVID-19 patients in hospitals to restrict human interaction and hence preventing the further spread of the disease. Autodesk Fusion 360, a computer-aided design tool, has been extensively used to design the robot.","Nainan, Aayushi",ICT Analysis and Applications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972267/,585

We employ an abstract algebraic semantics based on semirings. It encompasses the Boolean semantics and a quantitative semantics capturing the robustness of satisfaction, which is based on the max-min semiring over the extended real numbers. We provide a precise equational characterization of the class of semirings for which our semantics can be viewed as an approximation to an alternative semantics that quantifies the distance of a system trace from the set of all traces that satisfy the desired property.","Mamouras, Konstantinos; Chattopadhyay, Agnishom; Wang, Zhifu",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979233/,585
49730,Lessons from the Success Story: The Systematic Approach to Fight Against COVID-19 in Beijing,2020-12-29,"This book aims to substantiate the fact that religion still plays a key role in our contemporary society and that it is important to retain SRE/SRI in government schools. SRE provides a number of key benefits. These include firstly values education within the framework of belief in God or a higher spiritual being, which has been shown to be a powerful factor in empowering student decisions, fostering their ability to act and assigning student responsibility. Secondly, religious belief has been shown to strengthen students’ sense of identity and belonging and to have important psychological benefits for students’ mental health and wellbeing. Thirdly, retaining the rich mix of the different faith communities strengthens Australia’s multicultural fabric. Finally, SRE/RI classes provide safe places for students to explore the deeper questions of their religion and identity. At the same time, this study argues that SRE/RI pedagogy needs to be brought into the twenty-first century, ensuring best practice drawing on constructivist, reflected, critical pedagogy to achieve the core competencies of Social and Emotional Learning (SEL). This is needed to meaningfully engage the next generation. To achieve this goal, SRE/RI providers, with government support and assistance, need ongoing professional development and more effective transparency, accountability and supervision. As well, for effective multicultural education, a combination of Special Religious Education (SRE) with General Religious Education (GRE) is needed, so that children can, on the one hand, explore their own religious identity, and on the other hand learn about and interact with children of different religious faiths. This book argues that adopting these best practice approaches will meet the criticisms expressed about SRE/RI pedagogy to ensure a robust SRE/RI curriculum which is suitably equipped to develop students in contemporary Australian society. A strengthened SRE/RI program will enrich Australian society and improve students’ mental health and wellbeing, assisting to equip them to be confident, functioning adults in the rapidly changing contemporary world.","Gross, Zehavit; Rutland, Suzanne D.",Special Religious Education in Australia and its Value to Contemporary Society,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981068/,585

The well-known sine trigonometric function maintains the periodicity and symmetry of the origin in nature and thus satisfies the expectations of the experts over the multi parameters. Taking this feature and the significance of the SFSs into the consideration, the main objective of the article is to describe some reliable sine trigonometric laws for SFSs. Associated with these laws, we develop new average and geometric aggregation operators to aggregate the Spherical fuzzy numbers. Then, we presented a group decision-making strategy to address the multi-attribute group decision-making problem using the developed aggregation operators. To verify the value of the defined operators, a MAGDM strategy is provided along with an application for the selection of an authentic COVID-19 laboratory. Moreover, a comparative study is also performed to present the effectiveness of the developed approach.","Qiyas, Muhammad; Abdullah, Saleem; Khan, Saifullah; Naeem, Muhammad",Granul,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7982515/,585

There is limited data about new-onset diabetes in patients with COVID-19. We describe a case series of three Peruvian patients with new onset diabetes presenting with DKA who remained insulin dependent several months after infection resolution. Case 1: A 59-year-old man with no significant past medical history and normal glucose presented with fever and dyspnea for five days. He was hospitalized with hypoxemic respiratory failure and tested positive forCOVID19. Hypoxemia improved with supportive care, but on day three, he became lethargic, tachycardic, and tachypneic with 95% oxygen saturation on room air. Biochemistry revealed an anion gap metabolic acidosis with pH 7.3, bicarbonate 10 mmol/L (22–28), β-hydroxybutyrate 5.4 mmol/L (<0.5), and glucose 679 mg/dL. He was treated with continuous insulin infusion. After DKA resolved, he was transitioned to basal-bolus insulin and remained insulin-dependent during outpatient follow-up. Case 2: A 49-year-old man in good health prior to admission, was transferred to our hospital for acute respiratory failure and positive testing for SARS-CoV-2. Two days later he became confused, tachycardic, and tachypneic with 90% oxygen saturation. DKA was diagnosed based on a pH 7.1, bicarbonate 8 mmol/L, β-hydroxybutyrate 5 mmol/L and glucose 625 mg/dL. He was transferred to the ICU for continuous insulin infusion. After resolution of his DKA, subcutaneous insulin was started. Preadmission hemoglobin A1c was 4.5%. He remained on insulin post hospital discharge. Case 3: A 33-year-old man with normal glucose prior to admission was transferred to our hospital from an outpatient office with a two-day history of dyspnea and altered sensorium. He was tachycardic and tachypneic with 96% oxygen saturation on 3L nasal cannula. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. DKA was diagnosed with glucose 690 mg/dL, bicarbonate 4 mmol/L, serum β-hydroxybutyrate 5.8 mmol/L and pH 6.6. He was resuscitated with intravenous fluids and an insulin infusion was started. DKA resolved after 5 days and he was discharged home on subcutaneous insulin. He remained insulin-dependent on follow-up. Conclusion: New-onset diabetes with DKA due to SARS-CoV-2 is increasingly recognized, and beta-cell dysfunction can be permanent, resulting in insulin-dependent diabetes. Accordingly, our patients remained insulin-dependent several months post discharge.","Ramos-Yataco, Anthony; Capcha, Kelly Jasmin Meza; Harbuz-Miller, Inga",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089544/,585

53077,P071 Survey of rheumatology patient satisfaction with telephone consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-04-26,"Hepatitis B remains a major global public health challenge, with particularly high prevalence in medically disadvantaged western Pacific and African regions. Although clinically available technologies for the qPCR detection of HBV are well established, research on point-of-care testing has not progressed substantially. The development of a rapid, accurate point-of-care test is essential for the prevention and control of hepatitis B in medically disadvantaged rural areas. The development of the CRISPR/Cas system in nucleic acid detection has allowed for pathogen point-of-care detection. Here, we developed a rapid and accurate point-of-care assay for HBV based on LAMP-Cas12a. It innovatively solves the problem of point-of-care testing in 10 min, particularly the problem of sample nucleic acid extraction. Based on LAMP-Cas12a, visualization of the assay results is presented by both a fluorescent readout and by lateral flow test strips. The lateral flow test strip technology can achieve results visible to the naked eye, while fluorescence readout can achieve real-time high-sensitivity detection. The fluorescent readout-based Cas12a assay can achieve HBV detection with a limit of detection of 1 copy/μL within 13 min, while the lateral flow test strip technique only takes 20 min. In the evaluation of 73 clinical samples, the sensitivity and specificity of both the fluorescence readout and lateral flow test strip method were 100%, and the results of the assay were fully comparable to qPCR. The LAMP-Cas12a-based HBV assay relies on minimal equipment to provide rapid, accurate test results and low costs, providing significant practical value for point-of-care HBV detection.","Ding, Ronghua; Long, Jinzhao; Yuan, Mingzhu; Zheng, Xue; Shen, Yue; Jin, Yuefei; Yang, Haiyan; Li, Hao; Chen, Shuaiyin; Duan, Guangcai",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8125043/,585
53260,879 Establishing the First Eoe Deanery-Wide Trainee Led Virtual Journal Club: Keeping Up Morale by Encouraging Trainee Interaction and Continuous Professional Development During the Hiatus to Teaching Activities Enforced by Coronavirus,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims COVID-19 lockdown has affected the mental health of many people around the world. People with inflammatory arthritis (IA) are at a higher risk of mental health and psychosocial consequences of the pandemic compared with the general population, since they are potentially more vulnerable to COVID-19 and experience higher rates of existing comorbid mental health disorder. Furthermore, vulnerable patients were advised to self-isolate for 12 weeks, which could further exacerbate emotional distress. This study aimed to explore the impacts of lockdown on mental health and wellbeing, and to determine which factors were associated with worse disease outcomes. Methods An online questionnaire was completed by 338 participants in the UK with an IA condition between June and July 2020. The questionnaire, designed with input from a service user, assessed various aspects of the impact of the pandemic on the quality of life of people with IA, including their mental health. Self-reported visual analogue scales (VAS) for patient global assessment (PGA) of disease activity, pain, fatigue, and emotional distress were completed relating to the previous week, and retrospectively for pre-lockdown (March) and early-lockdown (April). Specific mental health outcomes were further captured using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ8) and the short UCLA loneliness scale. Linear regressions were conducted to determine mental health factors associated with worse outcomes on physical health measures (PGA, pain, and fatigue), controlling for fear of COVID-19 and COVID-19 status. Results Overall, 49% of participants met the PHQ8 criteria for moderate to severe depressive symptoms and 58% reported their mental health had worsened by more than 10 points on the emotional distress VAS during lockdown. Finally, 37% reported they were concerned about loneliness, with 26% indicating this had worsened during lockdown. Emotional distress VAS was significantly associated with PGA (b = 0.21, p< 0.01), pain (b = 0.24, p<0.01), and fatigue (b = 0.36, p<0.01). Similarly, depression was also associated with PGA (b = 0.95, p<0.01), pain (b = 0.92, p<0.01), and fatigue (b = 1.56, p<0.01). However, loneliness was not associated with any of the physical health VAS scores but was associated with the emotional distress VAS (b = 1.83, p=0.00). These results remained consistent for emotional distress, depression, and loneliness as predictors when accounting for fear of COVID-19 and COVID-19 status. Conclusion There has been a clear impact of the pandemic on the mental health of people with IA, and this should be taken into consideration by clinicians, especially as it appears to be related to worse overall reported physical health. The mixed results for loneliness in comparison to other mental health measures may illustrate the inter-relatedness of these aspects of mental and physical health, particularly in the context of lockdown.

This cross-sectional study explores the prevalence and predictors of anxiety/depression amongst healthcare workers in the UK, Singapore, and Poland. METHOD: From 22 March to 18 June 2020, healthcare workers from the UK, Singapore and Poland were invited to complete a self-administered questionnaire on psychological well-being. Anxiety and depression were measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Other components of the questionnaire include demographic information, Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) measuring safety culture and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) to measure burnout. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of anxiety and depression. RESULTS: Of 3537 healthcare workers who participated in the study, 701 (20%) screened positive for anxiety and 389 (11%) for depression. Significant predictors of depression and anxiety include low SAQ score, nursing role, redeployment, burnout, and depression. There was significant overlap between anxiety and depression. The doctor role was protective. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate a significant burden of anxiety and depression amongst healthcare workers during Covid-19. These findings highlight the impact of Covid-19 on psychological well-being and suggests which groups would benefit from targeted support.","Goh, E T; Denning, M; Purkayastha, S; Kinross, J",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135941/,585

54411,Dietary practices of adult Egyptians before and during the COVID-19 lockdown,2021-06-15,"BACKGROUND: The IBD patients management has been challenging during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, due to lockdowns, limitation of access to medical facilities and new recommendations regarding patient management. The implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on IBD patient’s management were assessed in our Tertiary Gastroenterology Centre in Bucharest, Romania. METHODS: Using the hospital’s medical system, records of IBD patients admitted between 15(th) of March and 15(th) of August 2020 have been retrospectively reviewed and compared to a control cohort of consecutive IBD patients admitted to our unit during the corresponding period of 2019, registering the epidemiological features, patient management and the incidence of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: 410 individual IBD cases were managed in our unit in 2020 compared to 532 in 2019, with a significant shift towards one-day hospitalization: 1059 admissions (9% ward hospitalizations, 91% one-day hospitalizations) compared to 1327 cases in the corresponding period of 2019 (17.8% ward hospitalizations, 82.2% one day hospitalizations). There was no statistically significant difference between the distribution of patient’s gender, IBD phenotype or newly diagnosed IBD cases between the two periods. A significantly lower proportion of admitted patients received 5-aminosalicylic acid (29% vs. 41.2%, p=0.0001), whereas a substantially higher number pf patients were prescribed biological therapy in 2020 in comparison to the corresponding 2019-time frame (79.5% vs 57.9%, p<0.0001). The distribution of the biological agent used was significantly different, mainly due to the increase of vedolizumab prescription in 2020 (p<0.0001). Among the newly diagnosed cases 50.0% had a severe disease requiring a biological agent (vs 30.2% in 2019, p>0.05). Moreover, from our previously diagnosed patients, 7.1% needed the initiation of biological therapy due to disease flare-up (vs. 4.3% in 2019, p=0.003). During the study period in 2020, seven IBD patients (1.7%) were diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) infection, all of them with mild symptoms without impact on the IBD course. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic led to reorganizing medical care, restricting the hospital admissions in favour of severe IBD cases, favouring telemedicine for mild disease and optimization of treatment for moderate to severe IBD with an increased use of biologicals aimed to maximize the risk/benefit ratio. Incidence of SARS-Cov2 infection during the first wave of COVID-19 infection in our study group was 1.7% and did not adversely impact the IBD disease course.","Costache, R; Iacob, R; Vadan, R; Stroie, T; Gheorghe, L; Diculescu, M; Gheorghe, C",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194857/,585

54952,COVID-19 and the Gender Employment Gap among Parents of Young Children,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common joint disorder in elderly individuals, causing pain, loss of physical functioning, disability, and reduction of life quality. Home exercise programs (HEP) serve as a crucial complement to outpatient rehabilitation therapy, as they save the cost of supervised physical therapy sessions, while also offering a high level of treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the 6-month HEP on pain, quality of life, and self-efficacy in patients with primary KOA and to identify the adherence level to exercises and associations with patients’ characteristics and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: After 6 months of HEP, there were statistically significant differences between groups for self-efficacy (p ≤ 0.001, from 58.29 to 71.5) (p = 0.23, from 55.98 to 57.72), quality of life (p ≤0.001, from 60.1 to 72.2) (p = 0.074, from 60.35 to 60.92), and pain severity (P ≤0.001, from 58.29 to 41.4) (P = 0.88, from 61.2 to 60.9) in favor of exercise group. CONCLUSIONS: Home-based exercise program improves pain score, self-efficacy, and quality of life in patients with knee osteoarthritis.

Tremendous efforts have been made to control the pandemic, among which neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are of specific interest to researchers. Neutralizing antibodies are generated within weeks after infection or immunization and can protect cells from virus intrusion and confer protective immunity to cells. Thus, production of NAbs is considered as a main goal for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) vaccines and NAbs may be used for patient treatment in the form of monoclonal antibodies. Neutralization assays are capable of quantitatively detecting NAbs against SARS‐CoV‐2, allowing to explore the relationship between the level of NAbs and the severity of the disease, and may predict the possibility of re‐infection in COVID‐19 patients. They can also be used to test the effects of monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma and vaccines. At present, wild‐type virus neutralization assay remains the gold standard for measuring Nabs, while pseudovirus neutralization assays, Surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) and high‐throughput versions of neutralization assays are popular alternatives with their own advantages and disadvantages. In this review article, we summarize the characteristics and recent progress of SARS‐CoV‐2 neutralization assays. Special attention is given to the current limitations of various neutralization assays so as to promote new possible strategies with NAbs by which rapid SARS‐CoV‐2 serological diagnosis and antiviral screening in the future will be achieved.","Lu, Yuying; Wang, Jin; Li, Qianlin; Hu, Huan; Lu, Jiahai; Chen, Zeliang",Scand J Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8236914/,585
55194,Rapid setup and management of medical device design and manufacturing consortia: experiences from the COVID‐19 crisis in the UK,2021-05-06,"BACKGROUND: The susceptibility and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) are associated with hyperandrogenism, obesity, and pre‐existing pulmonary, metabolic, renal or cardiac conditions. Hyperandrogenemia and ovarian dysfunction characterize polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrine disorder in premenopausal women. Women with PCOS have higher prevalence of obesity and higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases and renal injury, making them a population at risk for severe COVID‐19 outcomes. METHODS: Three‐week‐old female mice were implanted with Silastic tubes filled with the nonaromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT, 8 mg) or vehicle (empty tubes). Animals were maintained on high‐fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal fat) or low‐fat diet (LFD; 10% kcal fat, sucrose‐matched) for 90 days. Fat mass (EchoMRI), kidney and left ventricle (LV) weights as well as the cardiac and renal expression of the inflammatory markers interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), and interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β) were assessed. Moreover, circulatory, urinary, renal and cardiac levels of SARS‐CoV‐2 host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) were quantified. Additionally, renal and cardiac mRNA and protein expression of the multiple cellular proteases required for viral entry (TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, furin, cathepsin L, and ADAM17) were assessed. RESULTS: HFD exacerbated DHT‐mediated increases in fat mass (20.28 ± 1.10 vs. 6.78 ± 0.43 g, p<0.05), kidney weight (33.79 ± 1.35 vs. 26.52 ± 1.08 g, p<0.05), LV hypertrophy (7.48 ± 0.21 vs. 6.41 ± 0.28 g, p<0.05) and renal and cardiac expression of the inflammatory marker IL‐6 (1.5 and 2.5‐fold, respectively). PCOS mice on both diets showed higher urinary ACE2 (LFD: 18‐fold, HFD: 10‐fold) and altered renal mRNA and/or protein expression of all the measured targets. DHT upregulated renal TMPRSS2 (1.19 ± 0.04 vs. 0.98 ± 0.03 AU, p<0.05) and cathepsin L (2.64 ± 0.25 vs. 0.62 ± 0.25 AU, p<0.05) proteins in HFD‐fed DHT‐treated mice compared to LFD‐fed DHT‐treated mice. In the heart, LFD‐fed DHT‐treated mice showed no change in ACE2 and the cellular proteases on either the mRNA or protein levels except for ADAM17 protein that was significantly upregulated (1.63‐fold) compared to the vehicle‐treated group. On the other hand, while HFD‐fed DHT‐treated mice showed similar increase in cardiac ADAM17 protein (1.64‐fold vs. LFD‐fed vehicle‐treated), they showed higher mRNA expression of ACE2 (1.83‐fold) and furin (1.32‐fold) compared to the HFD‐fed vehicle‐treated mice. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings highlight women with PCOS as a population with a high risk of COVID‐19 associated cardiac and renal complications. Further, our study suggests dietary control recommendations for optimal management of women with PCOS that can ultimately attenuate COVID‐19 cardiorenal outcomes.","Rezq, Samar; Huffman, Alexandra; Basnet, Jelina; Yanes Cardozo, Licy; Romero, Damian",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239552/,585

Faced with the daunting task of adapting to the constraints brought on by the pandemic, a team of current and past course directors, while under extreme and fluid circumstances, designed systems to allow for a dissection based, in‐person curriculum for large student groups (220 medical and 105 dental) while maintaining a safe environment. Through immeasurable hours of deliberations, numerous unique and novel changes were instituted. Tank teams of students (6 medical & 4 dental) were assigned to rotating pairs of dissection or review teams. A complex plan of staggered student entry into and exit from the laboratory, provided for distancing. 3D printed face shields, designed and assembled in house, were provided to faculty; additional face shields were provided to students. An intricate rotating peer‐teaching component was incorporated to hand off the dissection between groups and to allow for study of anatomical variations. In‐person lectures were converted to virtual platforms using both synchronous and asynchronous formats. Medical tank teams met virtually to review and report on their dissection. A strict protocol was designed for in‐person self‐study. Students have embraced these designs and safety protocols and continue to perform extremely well. Student success, as measured by exam performance, is comparable to previous years. While several students required absences out of an abundance of caution, none of the students tested positive due to contact during the actual lab time. Three students reported testing positive for COVID‐19 following the Thanksgiving break. This time‐intensive endeavor required creativity, commitment, and leadership, and has had several novel benefits to include improved student to faculty ratio, more time for self‐study, and the additional responsibility and accountability for tank‐mates to act as both learners and teachers.","Occhialini, Annette; Nation, Haley; Johnson, Linda; Rahimi, Omid",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239559/,585

Our contribution focuses on the Italian case, where the Communications Regulatory Authority (AGCOM) was able to act as first mover in its field so as to strategically frame the problem of disinformation in the absence of a pre‐existing policy intervention. An emerging body of research shows that the activity of formally independent regulators is not necessarily limited to the implementation of delegated regulatory competencies. We discuss the implications of the activity of independent regulators for the fight against disinformation during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We find that as a political actor in its own right, the Italian media regulator claimed control over sectoral expertise in order to shape the crucial first steps of the response to the infodemic.","Di Mascio, Fabrizio; Natalini, Alessandro; Barbieri, Michele; Selva, Donatella",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8242663/,585
55391,"The role of tax in COVID‐19 response in Indonesia: The principles of flexibility, solidarity, and transparency",2021-03-25,"There is little research on how nationalism is adopted and deployed to foster but also to challenge sex-, gender- and HIV-related stigma in Thailand and other nation states across Southeast Asia. The available literature highlights how self-help groups for Thai people with HIV function as communities of practice, as sites of learning, and for gaining and preserving knowledge (Tanabe 2008, Liamputtong 2009, 2014). This article contributes to the literature by demonstrating how collectives of same-sex-attracted men and male-to-female transgender people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Thailand learn and teach each other how to alleviate social and personal barriers that impede access to health care. The study adopted qualitative research methods and interviewed 22 participants in five cities in Thailand. This article highlights how collective action, which adopts and reinterprets the symbols and metaphors of Thai nationalism, acts as a ‘deviance disavowal’ strategy (Davis 1961). By deploying Thai nationalism, same-sex attracted men and transgender PLHIV reposition ‘spoiled identities’ and break through the stigma they report after HIV diagnosis. Describing mechanisms of ‘deviance disavowal’ in Thailand may provide an opportunity to deploy strategies to manage stigma that interferes with access to health care in Thailand, and in other nation states, and may be applicable to other stigmatised groups and illnesses.","Berry, Scott; Scott, John; Ball, Matthew; Minichiello, Victor",Biosocieties,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8246123/,585
55392,Open Covid‐19: Organizing an extreme crowdsourcing campaign to tackle grand challenges,2021-03-23,"Financial accountability is a major issue for State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) especially because of the large amount of public resources invested in them and the social relevance of their performance. In the awareness that the public interest is increasingly pursued in abstract arenas, the investigation of accounting should be anchored to conceptual rather than contextual spaces. Building on the dimensional concept of publicness, this paper investigates the impact of three publicness dimensions (ownership, political control, and goal ambiguity) on earnings management (EM) in SOEs, a managerial practice that affects the quality of financial accountability. Drawing on data from a sample of 1200 Italian SOEs, the conditional revenue model (Stubben, 2010) is used to estimate their EM during the period 2009–2017. These EM estimates are then regressed against dimensions of publicness. Findings show that publicness is either neutral or relevant for the quality of SOEs’ financial accountability, depending on the dimensions analysed: while ownership and financial control are positively related to EM in SOEs, administrative control and goal ambiguity are not statistically significant predictors of EM. Moreover, the interaction of publicness dimensions does not affect EM in SOEs. Therefore, this paper shows that SOEs’ publicness is either irrelevant or detrimental to the quality of SOEs’ financial accountability, depending on the dimension of publicness considered. Efforts should be made to define policies and governance arrangements able to influence managers’ behaviour in a way that preserves SOEs’ financial accountability.","Ruggiero, Pasquale; Sorrentino, Daniela; Mussari, Riccardo",J Manag Gov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8246424/,585

56554,Protecting IP Licenses and Jointly Owned IP in the Age of COVID-19: Insolvency and Force Majeure Events under Japanese Law,2021-06-07,"Over the last decades, the U.S. has seen increasing income inequality and a widening wealth gap. Donald Trump’s presidency has deepened the political and cultural divide among Americans even more. As a result of these developments, many Americans have started to question the idea of the American Dream. For many, its promises of equal opportunity and upward social mobility no longer hold true. Young Americans, who are particularly affected by these trends, have started to demand big structural change in the American political and economic system. In line with that, they have championed progressive reform ideas and actors in the Democratic Party. While progressive politicians such as Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren did not secure the presidency in 2020, they were among the Democratic Party’s highest-polling contenders for a considerable portion of the campaign. Although Elizabeth Warren eventually dropped out of the presidential race, she often managed to drive its political agenda. Taking her strategic communication during the 2019/2020 primaries as an example, this paper analyzes which narratives of inequality are utilized in American progressive political discourse, how these are communicated, and which interpretations of economic inequality her strategic framing suggests. A corpus-based analysis of Warren’s framing reveals that two frames are prevalent in her discourse on inequality: the fairness-frame and the wealth-frame. These highlight to what extent the American Dream has proven unattainable to many Americans and indicate why an increasing number of voters support candidates who demand structural change in the US.","Rauscher, Natalie; Schäfer, Maren",Z Politikwiss,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8334326/,585

Introduction: Cleft lip and/or palate contributes significantly toward the global burden on the healthcare system. Artificial intelligence is a technology that can help individuals with cleft lip and/or palate, especially those in areas with limited access to receive adequate care. Inclusion Criteria: Studies that used artificial intelligence to aid the diagnosis, treatment, or its planning in individuals with cleft lip and/or palate were included. Methodology: A search of the Pubmed, Embase, and IEEE Xplore databases was conducted using search terms artificial intelligence and cleft lip and/or palate. Gray literature was searched using Google Scholar. The study was conducted according to the PRISMA- ScR guidelines. Results: The initial search identified 458 results, which were screened based on title and abstracts. After the screening, removal of duplicates, and a full-text reading of selected articles, 26 publications were included. They explored the use of AI in cleft lip and/or palate to aid in decisions regarding diagnosis, treatment, especially speech therapy, and prediction. Conclusion: There is active interest and immense potential for the use of artificial intelligence in cleft lip and/or palate. Most studies currently focus on speech in cleft palate. Multi-center studies that include different populations, with collaboration amongst academicians and researchers, can further develop the technology.","Dhillon, Harnoor; Chaudhari, Prabhat Kumar; Dhingra, Kunaal; Kuo, Rong-Fu; Sokhi, Ramandeep Kaur; Alam, Mohammad Khursheed; Ahmad, Shandar",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8355556/,585

Consequently, there has been a surge of research on it, which has expanded due to the pressures to be responsive during the pandemic of COVID19. Responsiveness is an attribute wherein the supply chains are equipped to respond resolutely and within a suitable timeframe to consumer requirements. The trouble to businesses posed by COVID-19 caught several firms off-guard. Further, there is limited research on the augmentation of supply chain responsiveness through new technologies. The present research, therefore, applies a hybrid approach by combining fuzzy Delphi and fuzzy AHP to understand the technology-driven enablers of supply chain responsiveness by employing a case company in food retail. The investigation reveals that supply chain integration technologies, sustainable manufacturing technologies, and smart warehousing are the most important enablers of supply chain responsiveness in the context of food supply chains. The results aid the key enablers that need attention and resources to be directed towards these enablers to eliminate a chance of missing on a successful transition into a more responsive supply chain.","Chauhan, Chetna; Akram, Manzoor Ul; Gaur, Diptanshu",JGBC,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8459823/,585

To assess the potential of waste heat from a 2D axisymmetric model of water jacket has made using ANSYS Fluent while applying the user-defined function (UDF) to the outermost wall of the cookstove having the temperature as high as 340 °C during the operation. Further, to ensure the recovery of the waste heat, without affecting the performance of the cookstove, an air gap of 0.05 cm was provided between the combustion chamber and the water jacket. The efficiency of the original cookstove without air gap was found to be ~ 33%, which enhanced up to ~ 43.79% without flow of water in the jacket, and finally reached up to 56% when water flows in the jacket. This indicates that the arrangement used in this particular study has not only recovered the waste heat but also improved the overall performance by ~ 69.34%, without disturbing the cooking phenomenon.

In vaccine formulations their inclusion has been also explored with interesting results. Currently mucosal vaccination constitutes a promising alternative with the main advantage of inducing both systemic and mucosal immune responses, which are crucial for control tumors and infections at mucosal tissues. In the present work the nasal immune-enhancing effect of four CPPs was evaluated in Balb/c mice. Animals were intranasally immunized with CPP and the recombinant hepatitis B surface protein (HBsAg) as model antigen. The antibody response in sera and mucosal tissue was measured by ELISA. The IFN-γ secretion response at spleen was also evaluated by ELISPOT and ELISA. Among the CPPs studied one novel peptide stand out by its ability to potentiate the humoral and cellular immune response against the co-administered antigen. Considering that the use of mucosal routes is a promising strategy in vaccination, which are gaining special relevance nowadays in the development of novel candidates against SARS-CoV-2 and other potential emerging respiratory virus, the searching and development of safe mucosal adjuvants constitute a current need.

However, we discontinued routine palpation from July 13, 2018, owing to a peculiarly high incidence of PICC-related phlebitis. The aim of this study was to prove that routine palpation was the cause of PICC-related phlebitis. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed medical records of infants who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and underwent PICC placement from January 2018 to January 2019. The infants were classified into palpating (before July 13, 2018) and non-palpating (after or on July 13, 2018) groups. We analyzed and compared the incidence of PICC-related phlebitis in the two groups. RESULTS PICC-related phlebitis was more frequently observed in the palpating group (10/29 infants, 34.5%) than in the non-palpating group (1/31, 3.2%) (p = 0.002). After discontinuation of routine palpating in PICC management, the frequency of non-scheduled removal of the PICC due to phlebitis decreased. The indwelling period was significantly longer in the non-palpating group than in the palpating group. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that mechanical stimulation using palpation of the insertion site was the cause of PICC-related phlebitis, resulting in early non-scheduled removal.","Igarashi, Aiko; Okuno, Takashi; Shimizu, Tatsuto; Ohta, Genrei; Ohshima, Yusei",Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/ped.14476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32964580/,585

These patients frequently require prolonged mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk for failed liberation from ventilatory support. We hypothesized that lung recruitment maneuvers and titration of positive end-expiratory pressure were both necessary to improve lung volumes and the elastic properties of the lungs, leading to improved gas exchange. DESIGN Prospective, crossover, nonrandomized interventional study. SETTING Medical and surgical ICUs at Massachusetts General Hospital. PATIENTS Critically ill, mechanically ventilated morbidly obese (body mass index > 35 kg/m(2)) patients (n = 14). INTERVENTIONS This study evaluated two methods of titrating positive end-expiratory pressure; both trials were done utilizing positive end-expiratory pressure titration and recruitment maneuvers while measuring hemodynamics and respiratory mechanics. Measurements were obtained at the baseline positive end-expiratory pressure set by the clinicians, at zero positive end-expiratory pressure, at best positive end-expiratory pressure identified through esophageal pressure measurement before and after a recruitment maneuver, and at best positive end-expiratory pressure identified through a best decremental positive end-expiratory pressure trial. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The average body mass index was 50.7 ± 16.0 kg/m(2). The two methods of evaluating positive end-expiratory pressure identified similar optimal positive end-expiratory pressure levels (20.7 ± 4.0 vs 21.3 ± 3.8 cm H2O; p = 0.40). End-expiratory pressure titration increased end-expiratory lung volumes (Δ11 ± 7 mL/kg; p < 0.01) and oxygenation (Δ86 ± 50 torr; p < 0.01) and decreased lung elastance (Δ5 ± 5 cm H2O/L; p < 0.01). Recruitment maneuvers followed by titrated positive end-expiratory pressure were effective at increasing end-expiratory lung volumes while decreasing end-inspiratory transpulmonary pressure, suggesting an improved distribution of lung aeration and reduction of overdistension. The positive end-expiratory pressure levels set by the clinicians (11.6 ± 2.9 cm H2O) were associated with lower lung volumes, worse elastic properties of the lung, and lower oxygenation. CONCLUSIONS Commonly used positive end-expiratory pressure by clinicians is inadequate for optimal mechanical ventilation of morbidly obese patients. A recruitment maneuver followed by end-expiratory pressure titration was found to significantly improve lung volumes, respiratory system elastance, and oxygenation.","Pirrone, Massimiliano; Fisher, Daniel; Chipman, Daniel; Imber, David A E; Corona, Javier; Mietto, Cristina; Kacmarek, Robert M; Berra, Lorenzo",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000001387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26584196/,585
63299,Analysis of a catastrophic commercial coach crash based on an improved accident causation model (ACM): Causes classification and lessons learned.,2020-04-23,"The emergence and worldwide dissemination of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria are a major public health threat. Metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) represent the largest family of carbapenemases. Regrettably, these resistance determinants are spreading worldwide. Among them, the New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM-1) is experiencing the fastest and largest geographical spread. NDM-1 β-lactamase is anchored to the bacterial outer membrane, while most MBLs are soluble, periplasmic enzymes. This unique cellular localization favors the selective secretion of active NDM-1 into outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Here, we advance the idea that NDM-containing vesicles serve as vehicles for the local dissemination of NDM-1. We show that OMVs with NDM-1 can protect a carbapenem-susceptible strain of Escherichia coli upon treatment with meropenem in a Galleria mellonella infection model. Survival curves of G. mellonella revealed that vesicle encapsulation enhances the action of NDM-1, prolonging and favoring bacterial protection against meropenem inside the larva hemolymph. We also demonstrate that E. coli cells expressing NDM-1 protect a susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain within the larvae in the presence of meropenem. By using E. coli variants engineered to secrete variable amounts of NDM-1, we demonstrate that the protective effect correlates with the amount of NDM-1 secreted into vesicles. We conclude that secretion of NDM-1 into OMVs contributes to the survival of otherwise susceptible nearby bacteria at infection sites. These results disclose that OMVs play a role in the establishment of bacterial communities, in addition to traditional horizontal gene transfer mechanisms. IMPORTANCE Resistance to carbapenems, last-resort antibiotics, is spreading worldwide, raising great concern. NDM-1 is one of the most potent and widely disseminated carbapenem-hydrolyzing enzymes spread among many bacteria and is secreted to the extracellular medium within outer membrane vesicles. We show that vesicles carrying NDM-1 can protect carbapenem-susceptible strains of E. coli and P. aeruginosa upon treatment with meropenem in a live infection model. These vesicles act as nanoparticles that encapsulate and transport NDM-1, prolonging and favoring its action against meropenem inside a living organism. Secretion of NDM-1 into vesicles contributes to the survival of otherwise susceptible nearby bacteria at infection sites. We propose that vesicles play a role in the establishment of bacterial communities and the dissemination of antibiotic resistance, in addition to traditional horizontal gene transfer mechanisms.","Martínez, Melina M B; Bonomo, Robert A; Vila, Alejandro J; Maffía, Paulo C; González, Lisandro J",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01836-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34579567/,585

The available information covered details on the physicians collecting the data, patients' characteristics, symptoms, treatments, and inability to work (in terms of physician-recorded workdays lost for own sickness or caregiving). The cost of lost productivity, estimated using the human capital approach, was calculated as the number of workdays lost due to influenza-like illnesses multiplied by the mean salary for one working day. Salary differences across sex, age and region were considered. Extrapolation to the national level was performed by adjusting for the size of the Swiss population, the age and sex distribution, the regional distribution, the number of Sentinel general physician contacts and the specialisation of the physician. RESULTS At the Swiss national level, the estimated total yearly number of cases of inability to work due to influenza and influenza-like illnesses was 101,287 in 2016 and 86,373 in 2017. In subgroups defined by year, gender, region and age class, numbers of cases per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 12 to 2396. The total number of workdays lost in Switzerland, considering degree of employment and visit day, were estimated to be 324,118 in 2016 and 278,121 in 2017. The number of workdays lost was generally higher in men (53.7% of the total in 2016 and 55.6% of the total in 2017) than women. The estimated total costs due to inability to work, calculated using a human capital approach and including the caregiving costs, were CHF 115 million in 2016 and CHF 103 million in 2017, equivalent to CHF 1.4 million per 100,000 inhabitants. CONCLUSION The costs of lost productivity due to influenza and influenza-like illnesses in Switzerland are substantial and may vary considerably between different years, regions and age classes. As the present analyses could not consider all causes of lost productivity (e.g., short-term inability to work not requiring a physician consultation, hospitalisations, early retirement, premature death), the total indirect costs due to influenza or influenza-like illnesses can be expected to be higher than the presented estimates.","Tomonaga, Yuki; Kyra, Kyra Denise; Lang, Phung; Born, Rita; Schwenkglenks, Matthias",Swiss medical weekly,https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2021.w30022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34495605/,585

Governor of Massachusetts and the Legality of Governor Baker's COVID-19 Emergency Orders.,2020-11-01,"In less than eleven months, the world was brought to a halt by the COVID-19 outbreak. With hospitals becoming overwhelmed, one of the highest priorities concerned critical care triage to ration the scarce resources of intensive care units. Which patient should be treated first? Based on what clinical and biological criteria? A global joint effort rapidly led to sequencing the genomes of tens of thousands of COVID-19 patients to determine the patients' genetic signature that causes them to be at risk of suddenly developing severe disease. In this commentary, we would like to consider some points concerning the use of a multifactorial risk score for COVID-19 severity. This score includes macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy), a critical host process that controls all steps harnessed by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus.

64712,"Covid-19: Sputnik vaccine rockets, thanks to Lancet boost.",2021-05-06,"Dietary intake, eating behaviors, and context are important in chronic disease development, yet our ability to accurately assess these in research settings can be limited by biased traditional self-reporting tools. Objective measurement tools, specifically, wearable sensors, present the opportunity to minimize the major limitations of self-reported eating measures by generating supplementary sensor data that can improve the validity of self-report data in naturalistic settings. This scoping review summarizes the current use of wearable devices/sensors that automatically detect eating-related activity in naturalistic research settings. Five databases were searched in December 2019, and 618 records were retrieved from the literature search. This scoping review included N = 40 studies (from 33 articles) that reported on one or more wearable sensors used to automatically detect eating activity in the field. The majority of studies (N = 26, 65%) used multi-sensor systems (incorporating > 1 wearable sensors), and accelerometers were the most commonly utilized sensor (N = 25, 62.5%). All studies (N = 40, 100.0%) used either self-report or objective ground-truth methods to validate the inferred eating activity detected by the sensor(s). The most frequently reported evaluation metrics were Accuracy (N = 12) and F1-score (N = 10). This scoping review highlights the current state of wearable sensors' ability to improve upon traditional eating assessment methods by passively detecting eating activity in naturalistic settings, over long periods of time, and with minimal user interaction. A key challenge in this field, wide variation in eating outcome measures and evaluation metrics, demonstrates the need for the development of a standardized form of comparability among sensors/multi-sensor systems and multidisciplinary collaboration.","Bell, Brooke M; Alam, Ridwan; Alshurafa, Nabil; Thomaz, Edison; Mondol, Abu S; de la Haye, Kayla; Stankovic, John A; Lach, John; Spruijt-Metz, Donna",NPJ digital medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-020-0246-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32195373/,585

In this review, we aim to discuss how AI may have a unique opportunity to tackle the many challenges faced in the glaucoma clinic. This is because glaucoma remains poorly understood with difficulties in providing early diagnosis and prognosis accurately and in a timely fashion. In the short term, AI could also become a game changer by paving the way for the first cost-effective glaucoma screening campaigns. While there are undeniable technical and clinical challenges ahead, and more so than for other ophthalmic disorders whereby AI is already booming, we strongly believe that glaucoma specialists should embrace AI as a companion to their practice. Finally, this review will also remind ourselves that glaucoma is a complex group of disorders with a multitude of physiological manifestations that cannot yet be observed clinically. AI in glaucoma is here to stay, but it will not be the only tool to solve glaucoma.","Girard, Michaël J A; Schmetterer, Leopold",Progress in brain research,https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.pbr.2020.07.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32988472/,585

72268,A Critical Needs Assessment for Research in Companion Animals and Livestock Following the Pandemic of COVID-19 in Humans.,2020-05-05,"To understand the range of psychosocial outcomes associated with a mass violence incident (MVI), there is a need to study posttraumatic growth (PTG). PTG is the experience of positive change that can result from contending with highly challenging life crises (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996). Studies have documented how characteristics of the individual, their trauma exposure, and how they cope or process the event can influence PTG. However, to our knowledge, none have addressed how the activities in which an individual may engage in following the trauma can influence PTG. Following a mass murder that impacted a university community, this study examined how pretragedy factors, objective exposure, psychosocial factors (e.g., core beliefs, posttraumatic stress symptoms, social support), and the posttragedy activities in which participants engaged may influence PTG. The posttragedy activities assessed were Mental Health Services, Informational Support, Grieving and Remembrance, Taking Action, and Coping Activities. Participants (N = 116; 68.1% female; 40% White, 31.3% Asian/Pacific Islander, 14.8% biracial, and 13.9% Latinx) who were enrolled in a college adjustment study the year prior to the tragedy were recontacted and asked to complete an online survey approximately 5-6 months following the MVI. Hierarchical regression results revealed that core beliefs and the posttragedy activity category of Taking Action were associated with PTG. Findings contribute to our understanding of the influences on PTG for university students impacted by a MVI and highlight the need to further examine the role of posttragedy activities, such as Taking Action on posttragedy adjustment.

Both patients were on long-term warfarin therapy with their most recent international normalized ratio (INR) prior to admission within their patient specific goal as managed by their outpatient Pharmacist. In both instances, the patients denied any changes in diet, lifestyle, or missed doses of medications upon admission interview. During admission, both patients experienced a marked elevation in INR within 24 to 48 hours of the initiation of remdesivir with dexamethasone for COVID-19 pneumonia directed therapy. The patients were both eventually stable and were instructed to continue warfarin monitoring and management under the direction of their outpatient Pharmacist upon discharge. CONCLUSION The underrecognized but probable interaction between warfarin in conjunction with remdesivir and dexamethasone warrants further analysis.","Landayan, Ronald Patrick; Saint-Felix, Sampson; Williams, Ashley",Journal of pharmacy practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/08971900211008623; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33853438/,585

Continuous enteral feeding methods may result in significant fat and micronutrient loss. This study evaluated fat loss in enteral nutrition using current strategies for providing high-risk infants fortified human milk (HM). The fat content of HM was measured by IR analyzer in a simulated feeding system using the Kangaroo epumpTM and the MedFusionTM 2010 pump. Comparisons in fat loss were made between HM, HM supplemented with donor HM-derived fortifier Prolacta+H2MFTM (H2MF), and HM supplemented with H2MF and donor HM-derived cream ProlactCRTM (cream). When using the Kangaroo epumpTM, the addition of H2MF and cream to HM increased fat delivery efficiency from 75.0%±1.2% to 83.7%±1.0% (p<0.0001). When using the MedFusionTM 2010 pump, the addition of H2MF to HM increased fat delivery efficiency from 83.2%±2.8% to 88.8%±0.8% (p<0.05), and the addition of H2MF and cream increased fat delivery efficiency to 92.0%±0.3% (p<0.01).

It originated in Wuhan, China and caused a total of 83,483 confirmed cases and 4634 deaths until June 2020. This novel virus spread primarily through respiratory droplets and close contact. The person-to-person transmission by direct transmittance through cough, sneeze, droplet inhalation, and contact spreading from dry surfaces contaminated with secretions of nose, mouth, and eyes of an infected person has been proven about SARS-CoV-2 transmission. As disease progressed, a series of complications tends to develop, especially in critically ill and immunocompromised patients. Pathological studies showed representative features of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and implications on multiple organs as well. However, no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines are immediately available for the treatment of this lethal disease. The efficacy of some promising antivirals needs to be investigated by ongoing clinical trials. In current circumstances, supportive care, precautions, and social distancing are the only preventive options to ameliorate COVID-19.

However, the debate on air transport and the influx of foreign investments and global energy demand on economic development remains questionable. Therefore, this study is an attempt to contribute to the body of knowledge in the energy-tourism-led growth hypothesis literature. For this purpose, a novel approach to the effects of international tourism on economic growth is introduced for the Next-5 largest economies, namely (China, India, Indonesia, Turkey and the USA) between 1990 and 2018. Empirical results reveal a positive connection between foreign direct investment and income levels, electricity production and income levels, as well as between urbanization and economic growth. Moreover, the validation of the environmental Kuznets curve and the halo effect of foreign direct investment on the environmental degradation process provides a shred of more substantial evidence and fitting environmental instruments for policymakers. The empirical results encourage sustainable economic growth in these countries, mainly through the attraction of clean and high-technology foreign investment, the increase of the share of renewable energy sources in the energy mix and the regulation in the tourism industry. The novel contribution of this study to the empirical literature is the unification in the same research of the TLGH and the EKC for the Next-5 largest economies, establishing recommendations for tourism, energy efficiency and environmental correction process.","Bekun, Festus Victor; Adedoyin, Festus Fatai; Lorente, Daniel Balsalobre-; Driha, Oana M",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16820-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34652621/,585

Patients and Methods From April 2019 to January 2020, 130 patients that underwent LNSS or RANSS in our hospital were included, and 90 patients (90/130) received CEUS examinations each one day from the postoperative day 1. The discovery of the cessation of contrast medium extravasation from the renal wound was the primary endpoint named ""ultrasonic healing"", and LOE ranged from the day of surgery to ""ultrasonic healing"". Patient, tumor, perioperative factors and LOE were collected. Univariate analysis and multivariate linear regression analysis were applied for the determination of factors associated with LOE. Results The average postoperative LOE was 1.76 days (standard deviation, 1.115; 95% confidence interval: 1.52-1.99). Ultrasonic healing within three days was observed in 95.6% patients (86/90). Univariable and multivariable analyses showed that R and A components in R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score were associated with LOE. Anterior location and R component score of 2 (tumor size>4cm) were related to longer LOE than posterior location and R score of 1 (tumor size<4cm). The incidence of complications in patients with LOE over one day was higher than those with LOE of one day. Conclusion CEUS was feasible, repeatable and useful in the assessment of kidney wound recovery. Tumor size and location were related to LOE after minimally invasive nephron-sparing surgery (MINSS). Length of stay after MINSS within three days might be relatively safe.","Niu, Di; Li, Liang; Du, Hexi; Shi, Haoqiang; Zhou, Jun; Tai, Sheng; Xu, Hanjiang; Chen, Wei; Yang, Cheng; Liang, Chaozhao",Cancer management and research,https://doi.org/10.2147/cmar.s297270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34017196/,585

We then created a model to predict the subsequent development of a PE with the current D-dimer levels of the subject. D-dimer levels changed over time from COVID-19 diagnosis, but were always higher in subjects who went on to develop a PE. Regarding the predictive model created, the area under the curve of the ROC analyses of the cross-validation predictions was 0.72. The risk of pulmonary embolism for the same D-dimer levels varied depending on the number of days elapsed since COVID-19 diagnosis and D-dimer determination.

Overall, 7 patients (25%) died. Among 22 patients (79%) who were admitted, 11 (50%) were discharged home, 4 (18%) remain hospitalized at the end of the study, and 7 (32%) died during hospitalization. Conclusions and Relevance In this single-center case series, COVID-19 infection was associated with a case fatality rate of 25% in recipients of HT. Immunosuppression was reduced in most of this group of patients. Further study is required to evaluate the optimal approach to management of COVID-19 infection in the HT population.","Latif, Farhana; Farr, Maryjane A; Clerkin, Kevin J; Habal, Marlena V; Takeda, Koji; Naka, Yoshifumi; Restaino, Susan; Sayer, Gabriel; Uriel, Nir",JAMA cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.2159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32402056/,585
83186,Data Sharing Solutions for Biobanks for the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-08-19,"BNT162b2, a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulated nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein (S) stabilized in the prefusion conformation, has demonstrated 95% efficacy in preventing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)1. Here we extend our previous phase 1/2 trial report2 and present BNT162b2 prime/boost induced immune response data from a second phase 1/2 trial in healthy adults (18-55 years of age). BNT162b2 elicited strong antibody responses, with SARS-CoV-2 serum 50% neutralizing geometric mean titers up to 3.3-fold above those observed in COVID-19 human convalescent samples (HCS) one week post-boost. BNT162b2-elicited sera neutralized 22 pseudoviruses bearing SARS-CoV-2 S variants. Most participants had a strong IFNγ- or IL-2-positive CD8+ and CD4+ T helper type 1 (TH1) T cell response, detectable throughout the full observation period of nine weeks following the boost. pMHC multimer technology identified several BNT162b2-induced epitopes that were presented by frequent MHC alleles and conserved in mutant strains. One week post-boost, epitope-specific CD8+ T cells of the early differentiated effector-memory phenotype comprised 0.02-2.92% of total circulating CD8+ T cells and were detectable (0.01-0.28%) eight weeks later. In summary, BNT162b2 elicits an adaptive humoral and poly-specific cellular immune response against epitopes conserved in a broad range of variants at well tolerated doses.","Sahin, Ugur; Muik, Alexander; Vogler, Isabel; Derhovanessian, Evelyna; Kranz, Lena M; Vormehr, Mathias; Quandt, Jasmin; Bidmon, Nicole; Ulges, Alexander; Baum, Alina; Pascal, Kristen E; Maurus, Daniel; Brachtendorf, Sebastian; Lörks, Verena; Sikorski, Julian; Koch, Peter; Hilker, Rolf; Becker, Dirk; Eller, Ann-Kathrin; Grützner, Jan; Tonigold, Manuel; Boesler, Carsten; Rosenbaum, Corinna; Heesen, Ludwig; Kühnle, Marie-Cristine; Poran, Asaf; Dong, Jesse Z; Luxemburger, Ulrich; Kemmer-Brück, Alexandra; Langer, David; Bexon, Martin; Bolte, Stefanie; Palanche, Tania; Schultz, Armin; Baumann, Sybille; Mahiny, Azita J; Boros, Gábor; Reinholz, Jonas; Szabó, Gábor T; Karikó, Katalin; Shi, Pei-Yong; Fontes-Garfias, Camila; Perez, John L; Cutler, Mark; Cooper, David; Kyratsous, Christos A; Dormitzer, Philip R; Jansen, Kathrin U; Türeci, Özlem",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03653-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34044428/,585

SARS-CoV-2 infection seems severely affected by background diseases such as diabetes mellitus and its related complications, that seem to be favoring the most severe manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 and, therefore, require special attention in clinical care units. The present literature review focus on addressing several hypotheses explaining why diabetic patients could develop multi-organ failure in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infections. Undoubtedly, as diabetes related complications are present it is expected to emphasize the severity of the COVID-19. Dermatological complications can occur and worsen in diabetic patients, and diseases such as acanthosis nigricans and psoriasis are prone to more severe manifestations of COVID-19. Approaches to treat SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, based on different solutions i.e. plasma therapy, use of antiviral compounds, development of vaccines or new therapeutic agents are ongoing.","Albulescu, Radu; Dima, Simona Olimpia; Florea, Ioana Raluca; Lixandru, Daniela; Serban, Andreea Madalina; Aspritoiu, Veronica Madalina; Tanase, Cristiana; Popescu, Irinel; Ferber, Sarah",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,https://doi.org/10.3892/etm.2020.9324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33101484/,585

RECENT FINDINGS Recommendations and policies from government and national health organizations, combined with social distancing, have led to exponential increases in telemedicine use. Teleophthalmology can be integrated into ophthalmic care delivery. In the emergency room, teleophthalmology can be utilized to triage patients and diagnose common ophthalmic eye diseases. Ophthalmology practices can utilize real-time medicine to conduct many parts of an in-person exam. In cases where more complex diagnostic tools are warranted, a model incorporating telemedicine and focused in-person visits may still be beneficial. Innovative technologies emerging in the market allow for increased remote monitoring, screening, and management of adult and pediatric patients for common eye diseases. SUMMARY COVID-19 created a demand for healthcare delivery that limits in-person examination and potential viral exposure. Teleophthalmology allows ophthalmologists to continue caring for patients while keeping physicians and patients safe. Although challenges still exist, the pandemic has accelerated the adoption of teleophthalmology. As a result, teleophthalmology will play an integral role in providing high-quality efficient care in the near future.","Kalavar, Meghana; Hua, Hong-Uyen; Sridhar, Jayanth",Current opinion in ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1097/icu.0000000000000689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32694270/,585

So far, the epidemic is continuing and very serious, with the number of infections and deaths increasing. Despite active investigations around the world to better understand the dynamics of transmission and the scope of clinical disease, COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly from person to person. The common signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection include fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea; in severe cases, patients may have acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis difficult to treat and coagulation disorder. However, some patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 in their respiratory tract may not have such clinical signs and symptoms. This report presents a case study analysis of a patient admitted in the Fourth Taiyuan People's Hospital, who had suffered traumatic injuries from a car accident and survived COVID-19, with pleural effusion as the initial symptom.

METHODS A survey was conducted of 104 adults who had to stay at home during the pandemic. Participants' depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, nutritional status, health-related quality of life, and sleep quality were assessed. RESULTS The frequency of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 37.5% and 29.8%, respectively. The frequency of depressive symptoms was higher in women, individuals age ≥85 years, and those with less education and low monthly income. Anxiety symptom frequency was also higher in women and those with less education and low monthly income. Quality of life and sleep were worse in those with depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms.

92250,Privacy and patient confidentiality in times of Covid-19.,2020-07-27,"Glycan-targeting affinity chromatography systems are becoming increasingly important as tools in the purification, enrichment, and identification of glycoproteins. The great advantage of this strategy is that immobilized lectin and antibody selectors allow specific glycan structures to be matched with a particular protein. It is also possible to show that a glycan seen at one site in a glycoprotein may not be present at another glycosylation site in the same glycoprotein. A problem with single-column affinity chromatography is how to obtain information on glycan diversity within the oligosaccharide portions of captured glycoproteins. Although all the glycoprotein species bearing a particular glycan feature will be captured by an affinity column, there is no way of knowing whether the ligand being targeted appears alone or coresides with a series of other glycan features in the same oligosaccharide conjugate. The work being described here examines the utility of serial affinity columns in determining whether individual glycan structures appear alone or together with other glycans in specific proteins. Four different types of affinity columns were examined in two series; the LEL → HPA → anti-Le(x)Ab → anti-sLe(x)Ab series and the anti-sLe(x)Ab → anti-Le(x)Ab → HPA → LEL series. Patterns in protein capture from these two series were very different. Thus, serial affinity chromatography (SAC) can be a valuable tool in recognizing diversity in protein glycosylation, especially when the order of columns in the SAC series is varied. Two clear types of diversity were recognized. One is the independent occurrence of different affinity-targetable glycan features in the same glycoprotein. The other is that multiple targetable glycan features were coresident in the same glycoprotein. The great advantage of this method is that it couples easily with current methods used in glycoproteomics.","Jung, Kwanyoung; Cho, Wonryeon",Analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/ac400653z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23758413/,585

DESIGN Longitudinal, cross-sectional survey. SETTING All adult ICUs within an academic health system. SUBJECTS Critical care nurses, advanced practice providers, physicians, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, social workers, and spiritual health workers were surveyed on burnout in 2017 and during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in 2020. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Burnout syndrome and contributing factors were measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory of Health and Human Service and Areas of Worklife Survey. Response rates were 46.5% (572 respondents) in 2017 and 49.9% (710 respondents) in 2020. The prevalence of burnout increased from 59% to 69% (p < 0.001). Nurses were disproportionately impacted, with the highest increase during the pandemic (58-72%; p < 0.0001) with increases in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, and personal achievement decreases. In contrast, although burnout was high before and during coronavirus disease 2019 in all specialties, most professions had similar or lower burnout in 2020 as they had in 2017. Physicians had the lowest rates of burnout, measured at 51% and 58%, respectively. There was no difference in burnout between clinicians working in ICUs who treated coronavirus disease 2019 than those who did not (71% vs 67%; p = 0.26). Burnout significantly increased in females (71% vs 60%; p = 0.001) and was higher than in males during the pandemic (71% vs 60%; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Burnout syndrome was common in all multiprofessional ICU team members prior to and increased substantially during the pandemic, independent of whether one treated coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Nurses had the highest prevalence of burnout during coronavirus disease 2019 and had the highest increase in burnout from the prepandemic baseline. Female clinicians were significantly more impacted by burnout than males. Different susceptibility to burnout syndrome may require profession-specific interventions as well as work system improvements.","Moll, Vanessa; Meissen, Heather; Pappas, Sharon; Xu, Kejun; Rimawi, Ramzy; Buchman, Timothy G; Fisher, Lisa; Bakshi, Vishal; Zellinger, Mary; Coopersmith, Craig M",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000005265; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34637424/,585
92650,Fear of Coronavirus Disease 2019-An Emerging Cardiac Risk.,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND AND AIM Access to specialized cardiac surgery is a problem in emerging countries. Here, we reflect on the approach we used to establish a cardiac surgery unit in Trinidad and Tobago. METHODS The program started in 1993 with monthly visits by a team from Bristol Heart Institute. A group of local doctors, nurses, and perfusionists were identified for training, and a senior nurse moved to the island to start a teaching program. The visiting support was gradually reduced, and the local team gained independence in managing the service in 2006. RESULTS The initial low volume surgery increased to around 380 cases a year with the implementation of comprehensive service in 2006. Most patients required coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). In-hospital mortality declined from 5% in the nascent years to below 2% thereafter. In the last 5 years (2015-2019), 1764 patients underwent surgery (mean age 59.6 ± 10.8 years, 66% male). The majority were East-Indian-Caribbean (79.1%) or Afro-Caribbean (16.7%), half had diabetes, and two-thirds hypertension (EuroScore II 1.8 ± 1.9). The majority (1363 patients) underwent CABG (99.5% off-pump; conversion to on-pump 1.5%). The mean number of grafts was 2.5 ± 0.7 with 98.5% and 23.1% receiving one and two or more arterial grafts, respectively. In-hospital mortality was 1.1%, re-exploration for bleeding 2%, stroke 0.1%, mediastinitis 0.2%. The length of the postoperative hospital stay was 5.8 ± 2 days. CONCLUSION Frequent outside visits complemented by training in an overseas center, and transfer of knowledge proved to be an effective strategy to develop a cardiac surgery unit in an emerging country with results comparable to accepted international standards.","Angelini, Gianni D; Ramsingh, Richard A E; Rahaman, Natasha C; Rampersad, Risshi D; Rampersad, Anand; Rampersad, Kamal A; Teodori, Giovanni",Journal of cardiac surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.14965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32827179/,585
92909,What have we learnt from Covid?,2021-04-01,"PURPOSE There is growing concern that inequities in methods of selection into medical specialties reduce specialist cohort diversity, particularly where measures designed for another purpose are adapted for specialist selection, prioritising reliability over validity. This review examined how empirical measures affect the diversity of specialist selection. The goals were to summarise the groups for which evidence is available, evaluate evidence that measures prioritising reliability over validity contribute to under-representation, and identify novel measures or processes that address under-representation, in order to make recommendations on selection into medical specialties and research required to support diversity. METHOD In 2020-1, the authors implemented a comprehensive search strategy across 4 electronic databases (Medline, PsychINFO, Scopus, ERIC) covering years 2000-2020, supplemented with hand-search of key journals and reference lists from identified studies. Articles were screened using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria designed to focus on empirical measures used in medical specialty selection decisions. RESULTS Thirty-five articles were included from 1344 retrieved from databases and hand-searches. In order of prevalence these papers addressed the under-representation of women (21/35), international medical graduates (10/35), and race/ethnicity (9/35). Apart from well-powered studies of selection into general practice training in the UK, the literature was exploratory, retrospective, and relied upon convenience samples with limited follow-up. There was preliminary evidence that bias in the measures used for selection into training might contribute to under-representation of some groups. CONCLUSIONS The review did not find convincing evidence that measures prioritising reliability drive under-representation of some groups in medical specialties, although this may be due to limited power analyses. In addition, the review did not identify novel specialist selection methods likely to improve diversity. Nevertheless, significant and divergent efforts are being made to promote the evolution of selection processes that draw on all the diverse qualities required for specialist practice serving diverse populations. More rigorous prospective research across different national frameworks will be needed to clarify whether eliminating or reducing the weighting of reliable pre-selection academic results in selection decisions will increase or decrease diversity, and whether drawing on a broader range of assessments can achieve both reliable and socially desirable outcomes.","Amos, Andrew James; Lee, Kyungmi; Sen Gupta, Tarun; Malau-Aduli, Bunmi S",BMC medical education,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02685-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34429084/,585

METHODS Prospective follow-up of 26 laparoscopic transperitoneal radical nephrectomies for suspected renal tumors in which the kidneys were extracted via a Pfannenstiel lower abdominal transverse incision. RESULTS The mean operating time was 152.3 (80-255) minutes, and the mean blood loss was 90 (20-300) ml. The mean extraction time was 20.4 (12-35) minutes. The mean weight of the removed specimen was 631.5 (190-1505) grams, and the mean longest diameter of the extracted specimen was 17.4 (9-25) cm. The mean extraction incision size was 10.7 (7-16) cm. No open surgical conversions were necessary. Pain control was excellent, with minimal intravenous morphine equivalent narcotic use by patients: 15.7 (0-31) mg in the recovery room, 33.8 (0-127) mg on the first postoperative day and 8.7 (0-60) mg in the first week after discharge. The patients experienced a short duration to full ambulation and normal dietary intake. Postoperative follow-up visits were recorded for at least six months. The patients reported a high cosmetic satisfaction rate of 97.7% (60-100). No late postoperative complications were observed related to the extraction site. CONCLUSIONS The operative specimen can be extracted via a low transverse Pfannenstiel incision during radical laparoscopic nephrectomy. This incision ensures the extraction of large specimens while preserving the aesthetic and functional advantages of laparoscopy without increasing the cancer risk. The absence of muscle cutting maintains the integrity of the abdominal wall and elicits minimal pain. No postoperative incisional hernias or keloid formations were observed.","Binsaleh, Saleh; Alomar, Mohammad; Madbouly, Khaled",Clinics,https://doi.org/10.6061/clinics/2015(07)03; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26222816/,585

94812,Analysis of Stroke Detection during the COVID-19 Pandemic Using Natural Language Processing of Radiology Reports.,2020-12-17,"PURPOSE Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is common and potentially fatal in patients with primary malignant brain tumors (PMBT). However, few data are available regarding its precipitating factors and prognosis. We sought to: (1) compare the causes of ARF and the outcome between patients with PMBT and patients with other peripheral solid tumors (PST), (2) identify the factors influencing ICU survival in PMBT patients. METHODS Two-center retrospective case-control study from March 1996 to May 2014. Primary central nervous system lymphomas were also included. RESULTS Eighty-four patients with PMBT and 133 patients with PST were included. Acute infectious pneumonia was more frequent in PMBT than PST patients (77 vs. 36%, p < 0.001). Pulmonary embolism was also more frequent in PMBT patients (13% vs. 5%, p = 0.042), while cardiogenic pulmonary edema and acute-on-chronic respiratory failure were more frequent in PST patients (37 vs. 10%, p < 0.001). Among acute infectious pneumonia, Pneumocystis pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia were more frequent in PMBT patients (19 vs. 2%, p < 0.001 and 19 vs. 8%, p < 0.001, respectively). ICU mortality was similar between PMBT and PST patients (24% vs. 24%, p = 0.966). In multivariate analysis, cancer progression (OR 7.25 95% CI 1.13-46.45, p = 0.034), need for intubation (OR 7.01 95% CI 1.29-38.54, p = 0.022), were independently associated with ICU mortality in PMBT patients. CONCLUSIONS The cause of ARF in patients with PMBT differs significantly than those with PST and up to 50% may have been prevented. Mortality did not differ between the two groups. These results suggest that PMBT alone is not a relevant criterion for ICU recusal.","Decavèle, Maxens; Rivals, Isabelle; Marois, Clémence; Cantier, Marie; Weiss, Nicolas; Lemasle, Léa; Prodanovic, Hélène; Hoang-Xuan, Khe; Idbaih, Ahmed; Similowski, Thomas; Demoule, Alexandre",Journal of neuro-oncology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11060-018-03074-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30536197/,585

METHOD A total of 172 patients were eligible for inclusion in the study. The patients were divided into 3 groups: group I, normal weight; group II, overweight; and group III, obesity. Perioperative outcomes were compared between the groups. RESULTS The median operative time was 72, 75, and 90 minutes in groups I, II, and III, respectively. The median blood loss was <50 mL in all groups. There were no intraoperative blood transfusions. There was no statistical difference in the rate of intraoperative incidences and postoperative complications. Moderately increased operative time was the only perioperative parameter that statistically differed from nonobese patients. The regression analysis found significant but weak correlation between BMI and operative time. The BMI did not correlate with other surgical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic adrenal surgery for obese patients can be done as safely as for nonobese patients.","Kazaryan, Airazat M; Marangos, Irina Pavlik; Røsok, Bård I; Rosseland, Arne R; Edwin, Bjørn",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350611403772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21502205/,585

98603,Two metres or one: what is the evidence for physical distancing in covid-19?,2020-08-25,"Many studies provided compelling evidence that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are involved in the regulation of the immune response, acting as both enhancers and dampeners of the immune system, depending on the source and type of vesicle. Research, including ours, has shown anti-inflammatory effects of milk-derived EVs, using human breast milk as well as bovine colostrum and store-bought pasteurized cow milk, in in vitro systems as well as therapeutically in animal models. Although it is not completely elucidated which proteins and miRNAs within the milk-derived EVs contribute to these immunosuppressive capacities, one proposed mechanism of action of the EVs is via the modulation of the crosstalk between the (intestinal) microbiome and their host health. There is increasing awareness that the gut plays an important role in many inflammatory diseases. Enhanced intestinal leakiness, dysbiosis of the gut microbiome, and bowel inflammation are not only associated with intestinal diseases like colitis and Crohn's disease, but also characteristic for systemic inflammatory diseases such as lupus, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Strategies to target the gut, and especially its microbiome, are under investigation and hold a promise as a therapeutic intervention for these diseases. The use of milk-derived EVs, either as stand-alone drug or as a drug carrier, is often suggested in recent years. Several research groups have studied the tolerance and safety of using milk-derived EVs in animal models. Due to its composition, milk-derived EVs are highly biocompatible and have limited immunogenicity even cross species. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that milk-derived EVs, when taken up in the gastro-intestinal tract, stay intact after absorption, indicating excellent stability. These characteristics make milk-derived EVs very suitable as drug carriers, but also by themselves, these EVs already have a substantial immunoregulatory function, and even without loading, these vesicles can act as therapeutics. In this review, we will address the immunomodulating capacity of milk-derived EVs and discuss their potential as therapy for RA patients. Review criteria The search terms ""extracellular vesicles"", ""exosomes"", ""microvesicles"", ""rheumatoid arthritis"", ""gut-joint axis"", ""milk"", and ""experimental arthritis"" were used.

The rate of prenatally diagnosed congenital cystic lung diseases is increasing, and such diseases appear to be a good indication for thoracoscopic lobectomy. METHODS We performed a prospective trial of thoracoscopic lobectomy for all congenital cystic lung diseases in children. Complete thoracoscopic lobectomy was performed by employing carbon dioxide insufflation without single lung ventilation. The results were analyzed, comparing patients with pre- and postnatal diagnoses. RESULTS Seven patients were prenatally diagnosed with congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAM) between January 2008 and August 2009, and all but one underwent surgery during the neonatal period (prenatal group). Nine patients underwent surgery after infection subsided due to lesions (7 CPAM, 2 intrapulmonary sequestration) postnatally identified by infection presence (median 2 years; range 15 days to 14 years) (postnatal group). The prenatal group showed a significantly lower rate of adhesions, shorter operation time, and smaller volume of blood loss. There were two conversions in the postnatal group. There were two postoperative complications (persistent air leak and phrenic nerve paralysis) in the prenatal group. The esthetic results were good. CONCLUSIONS Thoracoscopic lobectomy for congenital cystic lung diseases in neonates was practicable, with good esthetic results. Dissection was easier with significantly less blood loss in patients without adhesions, even in neonates. However, this procedure necessitated highly skilled endoscopic maneuvers within a small working space.","Kaneko, Kenitiro; Ono, Yasuyuki; Tainaka, Takahisa; Sumida, Wataru; Kawai, Yusuke; Ando, Hisami",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-010-2556-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20107813/,585

(radius, exophytic/endophytic, nearness to collecting system or sinus, anterior/posterior, and location relative to polar lines) nephrometry score after percutaneous ablation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective 5-year study was performed. Participants were 87 consecutive patients (median age, 67.1 y; 59.7% male, 40.3% female) with 101 biopsy-proven RCCs who underwent percutaneous ablation (54.0% cryoablation, 46.0% radiofrequency ablation). Follow-up computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was performed in all cases (mean follow-up, 34.6 mo ± 23.5). R.E.N.A.L. scores were analyzed to determine the association of the score with treatment outcomes and complications. RESULTS All tumors corresponded to stage 1A disease. Mean tumor size was 2.05 cm (range, 0.7-3.9 cm), and 50.5% of the lesions measured > 2 cm. Nephrometry score was > 8 in 31.4% of lesions. Overall recurrence rate was 16.8%, first-year recurrence rate was 7.9%, and complication rate was 9.9%. A nephrometry score > 8 was associated with increased complications after percutaneous ablation (P < .0001), increased overall recurrence (P < .0001), and increased risk of first-year recurrence (P < .0001). Immediate complications were associated with tumor size > 2 cm (P < .0001) and risk of local recurrence (P < .001). Age, gender, and percutaneous ablation technique were not correlated with recurrence or immediate complications. Patients undergoing cryoablation had a higher nephrometry score with no significant differences in recurrence rate compared with RF ablation (P = .199). CONCLUSIONS A R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score ≥ 8 predicts recurrence and complications after percutaneous renal ablation.","Camacho, Juan C; Kokabi, Nima; Xing, Minzhi; Master, Viraj A; Pattaras, John G; Mittal, Pardeep K; Kim, Hyun S",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2015.01.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25769213/,585
99989,Single-case Design Studies in Children with Cerebral Palsy: A Scoping Review.,2019,"The innate immune system provides a primary line of defense against pathogens. Stimulator of IFN genes (STING), encoded by the TMEM173 gene, is a critical protein involved in IFN-β induction in response to infection by different pathogens. In this study, we describe the expression of three different alternative-spliced human (h) TMEM173 mRNAs producing STING truncated isoforms 1, 2, and 3 in addition to the full-length wild-type (wt) hSTING. All of the truncated isoforms lack exon 7 and share the N-terminal transmembrane region with wt hSTING. Overexpression of the three STING truncated isoforms failed to induce IFN-β, and they acted as selective pathway inhibitors of wt hSTING even in combination with upstream inducer cyclic-di-GMP-AMP synthase. Truncated isoforms alter the stability of wt hSTING, reducing protein t 1/2 to some extent by the induction of proteasome-dependent degradation. Knocking down expression of truncated isoforms increased production of IFN-β by THP1 monocytes in response to intracellular cytosolic DNA or HSV-1 infection. At early stages of infection, viruses like HSV-1 or vesicular stomatitis virus reduced the ratio of full-length wt hSTING/truncated STING isoforms, suggesting the skewing of alternative splicing of STING toward truncated forms as a tactic to evade antiviral responses. Finally, in silico analysis revealed that the human intron-exon gene architecture of TMEM173 (splice sites included) is preserved in other mammal species, predominantly primates, stressing the relevance of alternative splicing in regulating STING antiviral biology.","Rodríguez-García, Estefanía; Olagüe, Cristina; Ríus-Rocabert, Sergio; Ferrero, Roberto; Llorens, Carlos; Larrea, Esther; Fortes, Puri; Prieto, Jesús; González-Aseguinolaza, Gloria; Nistal-Villan, Estanislao",ImmunoHorizons,https://doi.org/10.4049/immunohorizons.1800068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31026807/,585

A recognized correlate to cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia is attenuated frontal theta oscillations. Neuromodulation to normalize these frontal rhythms represents a potential novel therapeutic strategy. Here, we evaluate whether noninvasive neuromodulation of the cerebellum in patients with schizophrenia can enhance frontal theta oscillations, with the future goal of targeting the cerebellum as a possible therapy for cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. We stimulated the midline cerebellum using transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS), a noninvasive transcranial direct current that can be delivered in a frequency-specific manner. A single 20-min session of theta frequency stimulation was delivered in nine patients with schizophrenia (cathode on right shoulder). Delta frequency tPCS was also delivered as a control to evaluate for frequency-specific effects. EEG signals from midfrontal electrode Cz were analyzed before and after cerebellar tPCS while patients estimated the passage of 3- and 12-s intervals. Theta oscillations were significantly larger following theta frequency cerebellar tPCS in the midfrontal region, which was not seen with delta frequency stimulation. As previously reported, patients with schizophrenia showed a baseline reduction in accuracy estimating 3- and 12-s intervals relative to control subjects, which did not significantly improve following a single-session theta or delta frequency cerebellar tPCS. These preliminary results suggest that single-session theta frequency cerebellar tPCS may modulate task-related oscillatory activity in the frontal cortex in a frequency-specific manner. These preliminary findings warrant further investigation to evaluate whether multiple sessions delivered daily may have an impact on cognitive performance and have therapeutic implications for schizophrenia.","Singh, Arun; Trapp, Nicholas T; De Corte, Benjamin; Cao, Scarlett; Kingyon, Johnathon; Boes, Aaron D; Parker, Krystal L",Cerebellum,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12311-019-01013-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825131/,585

Free cartilage batten graft (FCBG) with secondary intention healing is an underreported yet effective repair option with cosmetically and functionally satisfying outcomes. OBJECTIVE To share the authors' experience using FCBG with secondary intention healing on multiple nasal subunits, including a detailed evaluation of wound/graft characteristics and design modifications to optimize success with this single-stage approach. METHODS A retrospective study of 129 patients who underwent FCBG with secondary intention healing after Mohs surgery from 2011 to 2018, using statistical analysis of numerous outcome measures graded independently by 2 fellowship-trained Mohs surgeons. RESULTS Overall, healed wounds were graded aesthetically as follows: excellent (24%), very good (31%), good (31%), or poor (14%). Excellent/very good outcomes were seen for superficial (p < .001), small-to-medium sized wounds (p < .0001) repaired with cartilage that closely approximated the defect size (p < .05). Consistently optimal outcomes were seen in the 19 repairs involving the alar lobule (mid-ala) alone, graded excellent (47%), very good (32%), and good (21%). A majority of patients (86%) experienced mild to no alar retraction. Although 67% of all patients had some skin surface contour irregularity, only 8% of patients sought dermabrasion. Neither hematoma, infection, ear deformity, chondritis, nor graft desiccation were reported.

Despite recent advances in understanding NOB physiology and taxonomy, there are currently very few cultured NOB or representative NOB genome sequences from marine environments. In this study, we employed enrichment culturing and genomic approaches in order to shed light on the phylogeny and metabolic capacity of marine NOB. We successfully enriched two marine NOB (designated MSP and DJ) and obtained a high-quality metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) from each organism. The maximum nitrite oxidation rates of the MSP and DJ enrichment cultures were 13.8 (0.1 mM nitrite as optimum) and 30.0 μM (0.3 mM nitrite) nitrite per day, respectively. Each enrichment culture exhibited different tolerance to varying nitrite and salt concentrations. Based on phylogenomic position and overall genome relatedness indices, both NOB MAGs were proposed as novel taxa within the Nitrospinota and Nitrospirota phyla. Functional predictions indicated that both NOB MAGs shared many highly conserve metabolic features with other NOB. Both NOB MAGs encoded proteins for hydrogen and organic compound metabolism and defense mechanisms for oxidative stress. Additionally, these organisms may have the genetic potential to produce cobalamin (an essential enzyme cofactor that is limiting in many environments) and thus may play an important role in recycling cobalamin in marine sediment. Overall, this study appreciably expands our understanding of the Nitrospinota and Nitrospirota phyla, and suggests that these NOB may play important biogeochemical roles in marine habitats.Importance Nitrification is a key process in the biogeochemical and global nitrogen cycle. Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) perform the second step of aerobic nitrification (converting nitrite to nitrate), which is critical for transferring nitrogen to other organisms for assimilation or energy. Despite their ecological importance, there are few cultured or genomic representatives from marine systems. Here, we obtained two NOB (designated as MSP and DJ) enriched from marine sediments and estimated the physiological and genomic traits of these marine microbes. Both NOB enrichment cultures exhibit distinct responses to varying nitrite and salt concentrations. Genomic analyses suggest that these NOB are metabolically flexible (similar to other previously described NOB), and yet also have individual genomic differences that likely support distinct niche distribution. In conclusion, this study provides more insights into the ecological roles of NOB in marine environments.","Park, Soo-Je; Andrei, Adrian-Ştefan; Bulzu, Paul-Adrian; Kavagutti, Vinicius S; Ghai, Rohit; Mosier, Annika C",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01667-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917751/,585

During the mean 2.4-year follow-up, NOACs were associated with a lower risk of developing DM than warfarin (HR = 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68-0.94, p = 0.007). Subgroup analyses confirmed that dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban each had a reduced DM risk. Stratified analyses demonstrated that the lower risk of DM associated with NOAC treatment was specific to elderly patients, ≥65 years old (HR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.62-0.89, p = 0.002) and those with good medication adherence (HR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.58-0.84, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Taking NOAC was associated with a lower risk of developing DM than taking warfarin in patients with AF. This article is protected by copyright.

Entrustable professional activities employ entrustment decision making as an approach to assessment in the workplace.Various scales have been created to measure 'entrustment,' all basically expressing the level or type of supervision a trainee requires for safe and high-quality care. However, some of these scales are only weakly related to the purpose of making decisions about the autonomy trainees will be granted. The authors aim to increase understanding about the nature, purpose, and practice of supervision scales aimed at entrustment.First, the distinction between ad hoc entrustment decisions (daily decisions in health care settings) and summative entrustment decisions (with a certifying nature) is clarified. Next, the non-continuous nature of entrustment-supervision (ES) scales, as opposed to most workplace-based assessment scales, is explained. ES scales have ordinal, rather than interval, properties and focus on discrete decisions. Finally, some scales are retrospective (""how much supervision was provided?""), and others are prospective (""how much supervision will be needed in the near future?""). Although retrospective scales reflect observed behavior, prospective scales truly focus on entrustment and ask for more holistic judgment, as they include a broader evaluation and a risk estimation to enable a decision about increase of autonomy.The analysis concludes with a discussion about entrustment for unsupervised practice and supervision of others, as well as the program-, context-, and specialty-specificity of scales.","Ten Cate, Olle; Schwartz, Alan; Chen, H Carrie",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003427; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32324633/,585

Preliminary results from Greece.,2021-04-13,"Background In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), occurred in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The coronavirus has spread throughout the world, posing a severe threat to human health. By using flow cytometry, here we observed the dynamic changes of peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets in COVID-19 patients, with an attempt to explore their roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and their impacts on prognosis. Methods Eighty-nine COVID-19 patients were divided into a moderate group (n=70) and the severe/critical group (n=19) according to the disease severity. Furthermore, the severe/critical patients were divided into the improved group (n=14) and unimproved group (n=5) according to the outcomes. The absolute peripheral blood lymphocytes counts and subsets, including CD45+, CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+, in the acute phase, and flow cytometry measured the recovery phase for all patients. Then, the results were compared with those in the normal control group. Results The absolute counts of lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and their subsets decreased during the acute phase in COVID-19 patients, especially in the severe/critical group. The T-lymphocyte count reached the lowest point on the 14th day in the severe/critical group. It rose with fluctuations to the normal level in the improved group as the immune function recovered; in the unimproved group, however, the T-lymphocyte count remained at a low level or even continued to decrease. The percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes showed no visible change in the improved group; however, the percentage of CD8+ T cells dropped in the unimproved group, resulting in higher CD4+/CD8+ ratio. Conclusions T lymphocytes count, and their subsets can be used for monitoring the immune functions and predicting the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.","Huang, Mingxiang; Wang, Yao; Ye, Jing; Da, Hongqiang; Fang, Sufang; Chen, Lizhou",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-5479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33240994/,585

The goal of the American Academy of Pediatrics National Coordinating Center for Epilepsy's project, Access Improvement and Management of Epilepsy with Telehealth (AIM-ET), was to identify access and management challenges in the deployment of telehealth technology. AIM-ET organised four paediatric neurology teams to partner with primary-care providers (PCP) and their multidisciplinary teams. Telehealth visits were conducted for paediatric epilepsy patients. A post-visit survey assessed access and satisfaction with the telehealth visit compared to an in-person visit. Pre/post surveys completed by PCPs and neurologists captured telehealth visit feasibility, functionality and provider satisfaction. A provider focus group assessed facilitators and barriers to telehealth. Sixty-one unique patients completed 75 telehealth visits. Paired t-test analysis demonstrated that telehealth enhanced access to epilepsy care. It reduced self-reported out-of-pocket costs (p<0.001), missed school hours (p<0.001) and missed work hours (p<0.001), with 94% equal parent/caregiver satisfaction. Focus groups indicated developing and maintaining partnerships, institutional infrastructure and education as facilitators and barriers to telehealth.

The distinct concerns of LGBTQ+ people when accessing midwifery care and support is an issue requiring a specific focus to ensure needs are met effectively. AIM The aim of this systematic review was to critically appraise and synthesise the best available evidence regarding the views and experiences of LGBTQ+ people in relation to midwifery care and supports. METHOD A systematic review was undertaken to identify all relevant studies meeting the inclusion criteria. A total of eleven papers were included in the review, utilising the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) method. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool (MMAT). FINDINGS Following data analysis, the themes that emerged were: (i) Contemplating pregnancy and ante-natal experiences, (ii) pregnancy and labour issues and concerns, and (iii) post-natal ongoing care and supports. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE It has become apparent from this systematic review that LGBTQ+ individuals have variable experiences when accessing midwifery care and support. Midwifery policies and practice guidelines should be reflective of the distinct needs of LGBTQ+ people and their families and friends. Future studies could focus more on the impact and outcomes of their care experiences within midwifery services.","McCann, Edward; Brown, Michael; Hollins-Martin, Caroline; Murray, Karen; McCormick, Freda",Midwifery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2021.103102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34333210/,585

Few studies have examined the role of laparoscopy in performing a Hartmann reversal. The aim of this study was to review our laparoscopic Hartmann reversal (LHR) experience with an emphasis on intra- and postoperative adverse events. METHODS A prospectively collected laparoscopic colorectal database involving 3 surgeons in 4 academic centres between 1991 and 2008 was reviewed. Factors evaluated were patient demographics, diagnosis, duration of surgery, intra- and postoperative complications, recovery of bowel function and length of stay in hospital. RESULTS Twenty-eight consecutive patients (13 men, 15 women) with a mean age of 61.1 (standard deviation [SD] 15.3) years and a mean weight of 72.3 (SD 20.1) kg underwent LHR. The diagnosis at initial surgery was complicated diverticulitis in 19 patients (67.9%), cancer in 6 patients (21.4%) and ""other"" in 3 patients (10.7%). The median duration of surgery was 166.2 (SD 74.4) minutes. There were no conversions. There was 1 major intraoperative complication (bleeding; 3.6%). There were 3 postoperative complications (10.7%): 1 abscess, 1 prolonged ileus and 1 wound hematoma. Only 1 patient with an abscess required readmission. There were no observed clinical anastomotic leaks. All patients underwent successful reanastomosis. The median time to return of bowel function was 4 (interquartile range [IQR] 3-4) days. The median length of stay in hospital was 5 (IQR 3-6) days. There was no mortality. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic colostomy reversal after a Hartmann procedure is safe and feasible in experienced hands. It is associated with low morbidity, quick return of bowel function and short stay in hospital.","Huynh, Hai; Trottier, Daniel C; Soto, Claudia M; Moloo, Husein; Poulin, Eric C; Mamazza, Joseph; Boushey, Robin P",Canadian journal of surgery.

However, a model-based evaluation of the spatial distribution of these events is lacking. PURPOSE Our aim was to quantitatively evaluate whether a network diffusion model can explain the spread of small neurologic events. DATA SOURCES The MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and LitCovid data bases were searched from January 1, 2020, to July 19, 2020. STUDY SELECTION Thirty-five case series and case studies reported 317 small neurologic events in 123 unique patients with COVID-19. DATA ANALYSIS Neurologic events were localized to gray or white matter regions of the Illinois Institute of Technology (gray-matter and white matter) Human Brain Atlas using radiologic images and descriptions. The total proportion of events was calculated for each region. A network diffusion model was implemented, and any brain regions showing a significant association (P < .05, family-wise error-corrected) between predicted and measured events were considered epicenters. DATA SYNTHESIS Within gray matter, neurologic events were widely distributed, with the largest number of events (∼10%) observed in the bilateral superior temporal, precentral, and lateral occipital cortices, respectively. Network diffusion modeling showed a significant association between predicted and measured gray matter events when the spread of pathology was seeded from the bilateral cerebellum (r = 0.51, P < .001, corrected) and putamen (r = 0.4, P = .02, corrected). In white matter, most events (∼26%) were observed within the bilateral corticospinal tracts. LIMITATIONS The risk of bias was not considered because all studies were either case series or case studies. CONCLUSIONS Transconnectome diffusion of pathology via the structural network of the brain may contribute to the spread of neurologic events in patients with COVID-19.","Parsons, N; Outsikas, A; Parish, A; Clohesy, R; D'Aprano, F; Toomey, F; Advani, S; Poudel, G R",AJNR.

Our aims were to estimate the incidence of pharmacological rescue events and death at discharge from an inpatient or outpatient hospitalization where GEP was performed with sedation, and to determine if capnography monitoring was associated with reduced incidence of these adverse outcomes. METHODS This retrospective Premier Database analysis included medical inpatients and all outpatients undergoing GEP with sedation. Patients were grouped as follows: (1) pulse oximetry (SpO2) only, (2) capnography only, (3) SpO2 with capnography, and (4) neither SpO2 nor capnography. Multivariable logistic regression and propensity-score matching were used to compare patients with capnography sensor use to patients with only SpO2 sensor use. Outcome measures included the incidence of pharmacological rescue events, as defined by administration of naloxone and/or flumazenil, and death. RESULTS Two hundred fifty eight thousand and two hundred sixty two inpatients and 3,807,151 outpatients were analyzed. For inpatients, capnography monitoring was associated with a 47% estimated reduction in the odds of death at discharge (OR: 0.53 [95% CI: 0.40-0.70]; P < 0.0001) and a non-significant 10% estimated reduction in the odds of pharmacological rescue event at discharge (0.91 [0.65-1.3]; P = 0.5661). For outpatients, capnography monitoring was associated with a 61% estimated reduction in the odds of pharmacological rescue event at discharge (0.39 [0.29, 0.52]; P < 0.0001) and a non-significant 82% estimated reduction in the odds of death at discharge (0.18 [0.02, 1.99]; P = 0.16). CONCLUSIONS In hospital medical inpatients and all outpatients undergoing GEP performed with sedation, capnography monitoring was associated with a reduced likelihood of pharmacological rescue events in outpatients and death in inpatients when assessed at discharge.

But, as federal, state and local governments begin opening businesses and relaxing shelter-in-place orders worldwide, we lack quantitative evidence on how policies in one region affect mobility and social distancing in other regions and the consequences of uncoordinated regional policies adopted in the presence of such spillovers. To investigate this concern, we combined daily, county-level data on shelter-in-place policies with movement data from over 27 million mobile devices, social network connections among over 220 million Facebook users, daily temperature and precipitation data from 62,000 weather stations, and county-level census data on population demographics to estimate the geographic and social network spillovers created by regional policies across the United States. Our analysis shows that the contact patterns of people in a given region are significantly influenced by the policies and behaviors of people in other, sometimes distant, regions. When just one-third of a state's social and geographic peer states adopt shelter-in-place policies, it creates a reduction in mobility equal to the state's own policy decisions. These spillovers are mediated by peer travel and distancing behaviors in those states. A simple analytical model calibrated with our empirical estimates demonstrated that the ""loss from anarchy"" in uncoordinated state policies is increasing in the number of noncooperating states and the size of social and geographic spillovers. These results suggest a substantial cost of uncoordinated government responses to COVID-19 when people, ideas, and media move across borders.","Holtz, David; Zhao, Michael; Benzell, Seth G; Cao, Cathy Y; Rahimian, Mohammad Amin; Yang, Jeremy; Allen, Jennifer; Collis, Avinash; Moehring, Alex; Sowrirajan, Tara; Ghosh, Dipayan; Zhang, Yunhao; Dhillon, Paramveer S; Nicolaides, Christos; Eckles, Dean; Aral, Sinan",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2009522117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32732433/,585

This study aimed to look for any associations between the attenuation values of liver lesions and their histological classification. The inclusion criteria for this retrospective study were focal or multifocal liver lesions and histological diagnosis. All of the dogs underwent pre-contrast and triple-phase postcontrast computed tomography (CT) examinations with identical timings of the postcontrast series. Thirty-one dogs were included in the study, and various benign and malignant pathologies were identified. The results did not identify any significant differences between the benign and malignant liver lesions, nor between the individual histological diagnoses. Inflammatory lesions were significantly different compared to the normal liver parenchyma, and significant hypoattenuation was found in the portal and delayed venous phases. Hemangiosarcomas were significantly hypoattenuating to the normal liver parenchyma in the pre-contrast and arterial phases, and also to all of the benign lesions in the arterial phase. The other pathologies showed variable attenuation patterns in the different postcontrast phases, and differentiation was not possible. On the basis of this study, triple-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography cannot differentiate between benign and malignant liver lesions, and biopsy and further histological analysis are necessary.","Stehlík, Ladislav; Di Tommaso, Morena; Del Signore, Francesca; Paninárová, Michaela; Terragni, Rossella; Magni, Tommaso; Pontonutti, Luisa; Carloni, Andrea; Alberti, Monica; De Magistris, Angela V; Vignoli, Massimo",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11010011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33374833/,585

124784,"Comment on ""Managing COVID-19 in Surgical Systems"": An Opportunity for Global Surgery to Advance Global Health.",2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND As the number of weight loss operations has increased, the number of patients who have failed to maintain sufficient weight loss has also increased, providing a management challenge to the bariatric surgeon. Conversion to a duodenal switch with omentopexy and feeding jejunostomy was performed for these patients. METHODS Between September 2006 and January 2010, 41 revisional operations were performed at 1 institution and by 1 operating surgeon. The data were prospectively collected and reviewed for several parameters, including excess weight loss, mortality, and morbidity. These results are reported. RESULTS A total of 41 patients underwent conversion of their original bariatric operation to a duodenal switch with omentopexy and feeding jejunostomy. The initial operations had been gastric bypass in 32 patients, vertical banded gastroplasty in 5, and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding in 4. The average excess weight loss was 54% in 31 patients at 6 months, 66% in 22 patients at 1 year, and 75% in 9 patients at 2 years. No patients died. The average hospital stay was 6.4 days. A total of 9 proven or suspected leaks (22%) developed. One was at the enverted staple line of a jejunojejunostomy that was diagnosed and treated the next day with little subsequent morbidity. The others were at the gastrogastrostomy or lateral gastric staple line and all occurred in conversions from gastric bypass. They were all ischemic type leaks and presented 5-11 days after surgery and closed relatively uneventfully with J-tube feedings and antibiotic/antifungal treatment. Other major complications included 1 pulmonary embolism (2%), 1 small bowel obstruction at the site of the feeding jejunostomy (2%), 2 stenoses (4%)-1 at the duodenoenterostomy and 1 in the body of the vertical gastrectomy. This gives a total major complication rate of 30%. A total of 3 patients required reoperation because of a jejunojejunostomy leak, small bowel obstruction, and stenosis at the vertical gastrectomy. No gastrogastrostomy leaks required surgical or radiologic intervention. One required revision for malnutrition, but otherwise the nutrition remained good. CONCLUSION Revisional surgery to a duodenal switch is a complex operation and carries a high potential for major complications. Nonetheless, it can be accomplished safely with good long-term results. Omentopexy, drainage, and feeding jejunostomy should be considered at surgery to treat the high potential for delayed ischemic leaks.","Greenbaum, David F; Wasser, Samuel H; Riley, Tina; Juengert, Tinamarie; Hubler, June; Angel, Karen",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2010.10.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21215708/,585

The purpose of this review was to update a 15-year-old former meta-analysis on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) addressing the question of whether ICH patients treated with dexamethasone have better outcomes than controls. METHODS The electronic databases PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane as well as web platforms on current clinical trials were searched for the years 1970-2020 without constriction on language. Data were extracted and outcomes were pooled for conventional and cumulative meta-analysis using a commercial software program (www.Meta-Analysis.com). RESULTS Finally, 7 RCTs were identified and analyzed including 248 participants in the dexamethasone groups and 242 in the control groups. Five studies showed a high risk of bias. The overall relative risk (RR) for death was 1.32 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99-1.76; p = 0.06) and did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. After exclusion of studies with high risk of bias, the RR for death was 1.37 (95% CI 0.54-3.42; p = 0.51). The RR for poor outcome did not differ significantly between the 2 groups analyzed for all included studies (RR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.47-1; p = 0.05) and after exclusion of studies with high risk of bias (RR = 0.7; 95% CI 0.45-1.08; p = 0.11). The RR for complications did not differ significantly including all studies (RR = 1.29; 95% CI 0.77-2.17; p = 0.34) and after exclusion of studies with high risk of bias (RR = 1.27; 95% CI 0.18-8.89; p = 0.81). The cumulative statistics delivered no other results; however, it pointed out fewer complications over time in the dexamethasone group. CONCLUSION Clear evidence of a beneficial or negative effect of dexamethasone is still lacking. Modern RCTs or observational studies with propensity design are necessary to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with dexamethasone in patients with ICH.","Wintzer, Stephanie; Heckmann, Josef Georg; Huttner, Hagen B; Schwab, Stefan",Cerebrovascular diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000510040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32932248/,585

Unweighted lottery procedures do not 'compound' (in the relevant sense) prior structural injustices. However, Schmidt et al do gesture towards a real problem with unweighted lotteries that previous advocates of lottery-based allocation procedures, myself included, have previously overlooked. On the basis that there are independent reasons to prefer lottery-based allocation of scarce lifesaving healthcare resources, I develop this idea, arguing that unweighted lottery procedures fail to satisfy healthcare providers' duty to prevent unjust population-level health outcomes, and thus that lotteries weighted in favour of Black individuals (and others who experience serious health injustice) are to be preferred.","Miller Tate, Alex James",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2021-107395; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33910973/,585

126426,Role of immersive technologies in healthcare education during the COVID-19 epidemic.,2020-09-02,"BACKGROUND Obesity disproportionately impacts children who are Black and Hispanic, those who live in rural communities and those who have low income. Predisposition to obesity early in life is profoundly impacted by feeding habits during the preschool years. The early care and education (ECE) setting impacts children's health by providing daily meals. OBJECTIVE The goal of this study was to identify whether or not health disparities in foods and beverages served in ECE programs in Georgia exist based on socioeconomic, demographic and geographic variables. METHODS A random sample was drawn from 3054 ECE programs across the state of Georgia. The likelihood of serving specific foods and beverages in ECE programs in the previous day was measured. Percentages and frequencies, logistic regressions, Spearman's rho and Odds ratio tests determined outcomes. RESULTS A total of 974 surveys were returned. Data were stratified based on the income level of the participant families, race of enrolled children and geographic location of the ECE program. Disparities existed between programs based on race of enrolled children and geographic location. For example, although the odds of providing sweets increased by 0.6% as the percentage of Black children enrolled increased, the provision of healthier foods, such as the odds of providing fruits (P = .001), vegetables (P = .001) and protein (P = .001) also increased. However, after results were adjusted for covariates findings did not remain significant. CONCLUSIONS Future research focused on evaluating the foods and beverages provided in ECE programs and the relationship of how income, race and location are related may provide further understanding about the disproportionate childhood obesity rates in America.","Kear, Kathryn; Stotz, Sarah; Love, Kim; Cox, Ginnefer O; Birch, Leann L; Cotwright, Caree J",Pediatric obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijpo.12787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729706/,585

Mechanisms for tissue damage by hypoxia/ischemia in the extreme premature involve inflammation. AIM AND METHOD To study cerebral inflammation after hypoxia/ischemia and oxygen treatment in the premature, we measured NF-κB activity in 5-day-old transgenic reporter mice in response to experimental hypoxia/ischemia. results were correlated to cerebral histological evaluation and plasma cytokine levels. A treatment strategy with the antioxidant tempol was tested. RESULTS One day after hypoxia/ischemia NF-κB activation was increased compared to controls [mean difference: 10.6±4.6% (P=0.03)]. Exposure to 100% oxygen after hypoxia/ischemia further increased NF-κB activation compared to hypoxia/ischemia alone [mean difference: 15.0±5.5% (P=0.01)]. Histological changes in the brain were positively correlated with NF-κB activity (P<0.001), but we found no significant difference in tissue damage between resuscitation with air and resuscitation with pure oxygen. Administration of tempol reduced NF-κB activation [mean difference: 14.6±5.0% (P=0.01)] and the plasma level of cytokines; however, the histological damage score was not affected. CONCLUSION Cerebral inflammatory response after hypoxia/ischemia in a mouse model with immature brain development corresponding to human prematurity prior to 32 weeks' gestation was influenced by administration of oxygen. Tempol treatment attenuated inflammation but did not reduce the extent of histological cerebral damage.","Døhlen, Gaute; Antal, Ellen-Ann; Castellheim, Albert; Thaulow, Erik; Kielland, Anders; Saugstad, Ola Didrik",Journal of perinatal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2012-0135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23241583/,585

126919,[Epidemic emergencies and social stigma. Which lessons should we learn from SARS and Ebola epidemics for the current CoViD-19 pandemics?],2020,"UNLABELLED Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (SARS-like CoVs) have been identified in bats in China, Europe, and Africa, most have a genetic organization significantly distinct from human/civet SARS CoVs in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates receptor binding and determines the host spectrum, resulting in their failure to cause human infections and making them unlikely progenitors of human/civet SARS CoVs. Here, a viral metagenomic analysis of 268 bat rectal swabs collected from four counties in Yunnan Province has identified hundreds of sequences relating to alpha- and betacoronaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on a conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene revealed that alphacoronaviruses had diversities with some obvious differences from those reported previously. Full genomic analysis of a new SARS-like CoV from Baoshan (LYRa11) showed that it was 29,805 nucleotides (nt) in length with 13 open reading frames (ORFs), sharing 91% nucleotide identity with human/civet SARS CoVs and the most recently reported SARS-like CoV Rs3367, while sharing 89% with other bat SARS-like CoVs. Notably, it showed the highest sequence identity with the S gene of SARS CoVs and Rs3367, especially in the RBD region. Antigenic analysis showed that the S1 domain of LYRa11 could be efficiently recognized by SARS-convalescent human serum, indicating that LYRa11 is a novel virus antigenically close to SARS CoV. Recombination analyses indicate that LYRa11 is likely a recombinant descended from parental lineages that had evolved into a number of bat SARS-like CoVs. IMPORTANCE Although many severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (SARS-like CoVs) have been discovered in bats worldwide, there are significant different genic structures, particularly in the S1 domain, which are responsible for host tropism determination, between bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS CoVs, indicating that most reported bat SARS-like CoVs are not the progenitors of human SARS CoV. We have identified diverse alphacoronaviruses and a close relative (LYRa11) to SARS CoV in bats collected in Yunnan, China. Further analysis showed that alpha- and betacoronaviruses have different circulation and transmission dynamics in bat populations. Notably, full genomic sequencing and antigenic study demonstrated that LYRa11 is phylogenetically and antigenically closely related to SARS CoV. Recombination analyses indicate that LYRa11 is a recombinant from certain bat SARS-like CoVs circulating in Yunnan Province.","He, Biao; Zhang, Yuzhen; Xu, Lin; Yang, Weihong; Yang, Fanli; Feng, Yun; Xia, Lele; Zhou, Jihua; Zhen, Weibin; Feng, Ye; Guo, Huancheng; Zhang, Hailin; Tu, Changchun",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00631-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24719429/,585

Contrary to what is previously known, outbreaks have been circulated continuously in the poultry sectors all year round without seasonality. These changes call the need for epidemiological studies to prove or deny the influence of climate variability on outbreak occurrence, which is the aim of this study. This work proposes a modern approach to examine the degree to which the HPAI-H5N1disease event is being influenced by climate variability as a potential risk factor using generalized estimating equations (GEEs). GEE model revealed that the effect of climate variability differs according to the timing of the outbreak occurrence. Temperature and relative humidity could have both positive and negative effects on disease events. During the cold seasons especially in the first quarter, higher minimum temperatures, consistently show higher risks of disease occurrence, because this condition stimulates viral activity, while lower minimum temperatures support virus survival in the other quarters of the year with the highest negative effect in the third quarter. On the other hand, relative humidity negatively affects the outbreak in the first quarter of the year as the humid weather does not support viral circulation, while the highest positive effect was found in the second quarter during which low humidity favors the disease event.","Elsobky, Yumna; El Afandi, Gamal; Abdalla, Ehsan; Byomi, Ahmed; Reddy, Gopal",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240442; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33119614/,585

The State of São Paulo (SSP) hosts the largest number of confirmed cases in Brazil, with over 60,000 cases to date. Here we investigate the spatial distribution and spreading patterns of COVID-19 in the SSP by mapping the spatial autocorrelation and the clustering patterns of the virus in relation to the population density and the number of hospital beds. Clustering analysis indicated that São Paulo City is a significant hotspot for both the confirmed cases and deaths, whereas other cities across the state were less affected. Bivariate Moran's I showed a low relationship between the number of deaths and population density, whereas the number of hospital beds was less related, implying that the fatality depends substantially on the actual patients' conditions. Multivariate Local Geary showed a positive relationship between the number of deaths and population density, with two cities near São Paulo City being negatively related; the relationship between the number of deaths and hospital beds availability in the São Paulo Metropolitan Area was basically positive. Social isolation measures throughout the State of São Paulo have been gradually increasing since early March, an action that helped to slow down the emergence of the new confirmed cases, highlighting the importance of the safe-distancing measures in mitigating the local transmission within and between cities in the state.","Alcântara, Enner; Mantovani, José; Rotta, Luiz; Park, Edward; Rodrigues, Thanan; Campos Carvalho, Fernando; Roberto Souza Filho, Carlos",Geospatial health,https://doi.org/10.4081/gh.2020.925; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33461264/,585

Therefore, hyperoxia is often encountered in critically ill patients. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that hyperoxia may affect outcome, although mechanisms are unclear. Immunologic effects might be involved, as hyperoxia was shown to attenuate inflammation and organ damage in preclinical models. However, it remains unclear whether these observations can be ascribed to direct immunosuppressive effects of hyperoxia or to preserved tissue oxygenation. In contrast to these putative anti-inflammatory effects, hyperoxia may elicit an inflammatory response and organ damage in itself, known as oxygen toxicity. Here, we demonstrate that, in the absence of systemic inflammation, short-term hyperoxia (100% O2 for 2.5 hours in mice and 3.5 hours in humans) does not result in increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in both mice and healthy volunteers. Furthermore, we show that, compared with room air, hyperoxia does not affect the systemic inflammatory response elicited by administration of bacterial endotoxin in mice and man. Finally, neutrophil phagocytosis and ROS generation are unaffected by short-term hyperoxia. Our results indicate that hyperoxia does not exert direct anti-inflammatory effects and temper expectations of using it as an immunomodulatory treatment strategy.","Kiers, Dorien; Gerretsen, Jelle; Janssen, Emmy; John, Aaron; Groeneveld, R; van der Hoeven, Johannes G; Scheffer, Gert-Jan; Pickkers, Peter; Kox, Matthijs",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep17441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26616217/,585

The fucoidan has expanded a widespread range of pharmacological properties as an anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, antiangiogenic, immunomodulatory, anti-adhesive, anticancer, antidiabetic, antiviral and anti-neurodegenerative agents owing to their diverse chemical conformation and potent antioxidant activity. The antioxidant and immunomodulatory activities of the fucoidan contribute towards their disease preventive potency through dynamic modulation of key intracellular signalling pathways, regulation of ROS accumulation, and maintenance of principal cell survival and death pathways. Additionally, it also reduces cancer-associated cachexia. Despite the wide range of therapeutic potency, the fucoidan is heavily regarded as an unexplored plethora of druggable entities in the current situation. The isolation, screening, biological application, pre-clinical, and clinical assessment along with large scale cost-effective production remain a foremost task to be assessed. Moreover, the chemical synthesis of the present bioactive drug with confirmational rearrangement for enhanced availability and bioactivity also need tenacious investigation. Hence, in the present review, we give attention to the source of isolation of fucoidan, their principle strategic deployment in disease prevention, and the mechanistic investigation of how it works to combat different diseases that can be used for future therapeutic intervention.","Pradhan, Biswajita; Patra, Srimanta; Nayak, Rabindra; Behera, Chhandashree; Dash, Soumya Ranjan; Nayak, Sneha; Sahu, Binod Bihari; Bhutia, Sujit K; Jena, Mrutyunjay",International journal of biological macromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.09.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916197/,585

Affibody molecules based on a nonimmunoglobulin scaffold have demonstrated a high potential for in vivo molecular imaging of HER2-expressing tumors. The reengineering of the molecular scaffold has led to a second generation of optimized Affibody molecules that have a surface distinctly different from the parental protein domain from staphylococcal protein A. Compared with the parental molecule, the new tracer showed a further increased melting point, stability, and overall hydrophilicity and was more amenable to chemical peptide synthesis. The goal of this study was to assess the potential effects of this extensive reengineering on HER2 targeting, using ABY-025, a DOTA-conjugated variant of the novel tracer. METHODS (111)In-ABY-025 was compared with previously evaluated parent HER2-binding Affibody tracers in vitro and in vivo. The in vivo behavior was further evaluated in mice bearing SKOV-3 xenografts, rats, and cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). RESULTS (111)In-ABY-025 bound specifically to HER2 in vitro and in vivo. Direct comparison with the previous generation of HER2-binding tracers showed that ABY-025 retained excellent targeting properties. Rapid blood clearance was shown in mice, rats, and macaques. A highly specific tumor uptake of 16.7 +/- 2.5 percentage injected activity per gram of tissue was seen at 4 h after injection. The tumor-to-blood ratio was 6.3 at 0.5 h and 88 at 4 h and increased up to 3 d after injection. gamma-camera imaging of tumors was already possible at 0.5 h after injection. Furthermore, the repeated intravenous administration of ABY-025 did not induce antibody formation in rats. CONCLUSION The biodistribution of (111)In-ABY-025 was in remarkably good agreement with the parent tracers, despite profound reengineering of the nonbinding surface. The molecule displayed rapid blood clearance in all species investigated and excellent targeting capacity in tumor-bearing mice, leading to high tumor-to-organ-ratios and high-contrast imaging shortly after injection.","Ahlgren, Sara; Orlova, Anna; Wållberg, Helena; Hansson, Monika; Sandström, Mattias; Lewsley, Richard; Wennborg, Anders; Abrahmsén, Lars; Tolmachev, Vladimir; Feldwisch, Joachim","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.109.073346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20554729/,585
135514,Striving as a nation to become an academic leader in the COVID-19 crisis.,2020-04-17,"Endovascular thrombectomy for large vessel ischaemic stroke substantially reduces disability, with recent positive randomised trials leading to guideline changes worldwide. This review discusses in detail the evidence provided by recent randomised trials and meta-analyses, the remaining areas of uncertainty and the future directions for research. The data from existing trials have demonstrated the robust benefit of endovascular thrombectomy for internal carotid and proximal middle cerebral artery occlusions. Uncertainty remains for more distal occlusions where the efficacy of alteplase is greater, less tissue is at risk and the safety of endovascular procedures is less established. Basilar artery occlusion was excluded from the trials, but with a dire natural history and proof of principle that rapid reperfusion is effective, it seems reasonable to continue treating these patients pending ongoing trial results. There has been no evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effect in clinically defined subgroups by age, indeed, those aged >80 years have at least as great an overall reduction in disability and reduced mortality. Similarly there was no heterogeneity across the range of baseline stroke severities included in the trials. Evidence that routine use of general anaesthesia reduces the benefit of endovascular thrombectomy is increasing and conscious sedation is generally preferred unless severe agitation or airway compromise is present. The impact of time delays has become clearer with description of onset to imaging and imaging to reperfusion epochs. Delays in the onset to imaging reduce the proportion of patients with salvageable brain tissue. However, in the presence of favourable imaging, rapid treatment appears beneficial regardless of the onset to imaging time elapsed. Imaging to reperfusion delays lead to decay in the clinical benefit achieved, particularly in those with less robust collateral flow. The brain imaging options to assess prognosis have various advantages and disadvantages, but whatever strategy is employed must be fast. Ongoing trials are investigating extended time windows, using advanced brain imaging selection. There is also a need for further technical advances to maximise rates of complete reperfusion in the minimum time.","Campbell, Bruce C V; Donnan, Geoffrey A; Mitchell, Peter J; Davis, Stephen M",Stroke and vascular neurology,https://doi.org/10.1136/svn-2015-000004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28959994/,585

Results Eighteen COVID-19-positive patients (age 72.9 ± 13.2 years) were admitted, out of which 66% were males. All these patients had pneumonia and 67% had respiratory distress syndrome; no one required mechanical ventilation. Mean hospital stay was 9.4 ± 5.3 days, and mortality, 11%. PCR tests were applied to all hospital residents (n = 827) and workers (n = 519), 1,044 phone calls were made and 36 hospital admissions were avoided. Only 50 patients required close follow-up, out of which four (0.48%) were positive for COVID-19. Conclusion Clinical monitoring at the hospital and social health centers showed that patient profile was like that documented in the literature and that the incidence of COVID-19 was low in social health centers.","Sardiña-González, Cristina; López-Reboiro, Manuel Lorenzo; Suárez-Fuentetaja, Rebeca; Castro-Conde, Beatriz Ares; Álvarez-Asensio, Enrique; López-Castro, José",Gaceta medica de Mexico,https://doi.org/10.24875/gmm.20000299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831342/,585

It can have a negative effect on patient outcomes and safety and human resources in healthcare organisations. This study aims to examine factors that influence workplace silence among hospital doctors in Ireland. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH A national, cross-sectional, online survey of hospital doctors in Ireland was conducted in October-November 2019; 1,070 hospital doctors responded. This paper focuses on responses to the question ""If you had concerns about your working conditions, would you raise them?"". In total, 227 hospital doctor respondents (25%) stated that they would not raise concerns about their working conditions. Qualitative thematic analysis was carried out on free-text responses to explore why these doctors choose to opt for silence regarding their working conditions. FINDINGS Reputational risk, lack of energy and time, a perceived inability to effect change and cultural norms all discourage doctors from raising concerns about working conditions. Apathy arose as change to working conditions was perceived as highly unlikely. In turn, this had scope to lead to neglect and exit. Voice was seen as risky for some respondents, who feared that complaining could damage their career prospects and workplace relationships. ORIGINALITY/VALUE This study highlights the systemic, cultural and practical issues that pressure hospital doctors in Ireland to opt for silence around working conditions. It adds to the literature on workplace silence and voice within the medical profession and provides a framework for comparative analysis of doctors' silence and voice in other settings.","Creese, Jennifer; Byrne, John-Paul; Matthews, Anne; McDermott, Aoife M; Conway, Edel; Humphries, Niamh",Journal of health organization and management,https://doi.org/10.1108/jhom-08-2020-0353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955211/,585
136604,Quasi-experimental study designs series-paper 11: supporting the production and use of health systems research syntheses that draw on quasi-experimental study designs.,2017,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 represents a global public health emergency. The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells requires the activation of its spike protein by host cell proteases. The serine protease, TMPRSS2, and cysteine proteases, Cathepsins B/L, activate spike protein and enable SARS-CoV-2 entry to the host cell through two completely different and independent pathways. Therefore, inhibiting either TMPRSS2 or cathepsin B/L may not sufficiently block the virus entry. We here hypothesized that simultaneous targeting of both the entry pathways would be more efficient to block the virus entry rather than targeting the entry pathways individually. To this end, we utilized the network-based drug repurposing analyses to identify the possible common drugs that can target both the entry pathways. This study, for the first time, reports the molecules like cyclosporine, calcitriol, and estradiol as candidate drugs with the binding ability to the host proteases, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin B/L. Next, we analyzed drug-gene and gene-gene interaction networks using 332 human targets of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The network results indicate that, out of 332 human proteins, cyclosporine interacts with 216 (65%) proteins. Furthermore, we performed molecular docking and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the binding of drug with TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. The molecular docking and MD simulation results showed strong and stable binding of cyclosporine A (CsA) with TMPRSS2 and CTSL genes. The above results indicate cyclosporine as a potential drug molecule, as apart from interacting with SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors, it also interacts with most of SARS-CoV-2 target host genes; thus it could potentially interfere with functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells. We here also suggest that these antiviral drugs alone or in combination can simultaneously target both the entry pathways and thus can be considered as a potential treatment option for COVID-19.","Prasad, Kartikay; Ahamad, Shahzaib; Kanipakam, Hema; Gupta, Dinesh; Kumar, Vijay",ACS chemical neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1021/acschemneuro.1c00019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606519/,585

A novel, un-documented biomarker of arsenic exposure, CyclinA was identified by microarray analysis from the study. Non-transformed cell lines HaCat and Int407 when exposed to clinically achievable arsenic concentration showed significant increase of CyclinA substantiating the clinical data. An associated increase in S phase population of cells in cell cycle, indicative of enhanced proliferation was also noticed. On further investigation of the pathway to arsenic-induced proliferation, we observed that arsenic resulted: ROS generation; activated Erk signaling; stimulated AP-1 activity, including immediate early genes, c-Jun and c-Fos.

NUDT15-associated subcellular thiopurine metabolism has not been investigated in primary lymphocytes. We hypothesized that NUDT15 mutation increases DNA-incorporated deoxythioguanosine (dTG) and induces apoptosis in lymphocytes. METHODS DNA-incorporated dTG in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) in red blood cells were measured in patients with IBD undergoing thiopurine treatment. The association of a single nucleotide polymorphism for NUDT15 (rs116855232) with dTGPBMC was examined. The pro-apoptotic effect of DNA-incorporated dTG was examined ex vivo in association with NUDT15 genotypes by co-culturing patient-derived peripheral CD4+ T lymphocytes with 6-thioguanine (6-TG). RESULTS dTGPBMC was significantly higher in NUDT15 variants than in non-variants. dTGPBMC, but not 6-TGNRBC, negatively correlated with peripheral lymphocyte counts (r = - 0.31 and - 0.12, p = 0.012 and 0.173, respectively). DNA-incorporated dTG significantly accumulated to a greater extent in lymphocytes from NUDT15 variants when co-cultured with 6-TG ex vivo than in those from non-variants and was associated with decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. CONCLUSION Increased DNA-incorporated dTG may be responsible for thiopurine-induced leukocytopenia through cell apoptosis in IBD patients with NUDT15 mutation.","Toyonaga, Takahiko; Kobayashi, Taku; Kuronuma, Satoshi; Ueno, Aito; Kiyohara, Hiroki; Okabayashi, Shinji; Takeuchi, Osamu; Redfern, Christopher P F; Terai, Hideki; Ozaki, Ryo; Sagami, Shintaro; Nakano, Masaru; Coulthard, Sally A; Tanaka, Yoichi; Hibi, Toshifumi",Journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00535-021-01820-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34480209/,585

In this study, we evaluated the analytical performance and clinical usefulness of a recently-introduced multiplex PCR assay, Seeplex Pneumobacter detection kit (Seegene Inc., Korea) for the identification of respiratory bacterial pathogens. METHODS One hundred and eighty one nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from pediatric patients with respiratory symptoms and analysed by multiplex PCR for the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.P), Haemophilus influenzae (H.I), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M.P), Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C.P), Bordetella pertussis (B.P) and Legionella pneumophila (L.P). A comparison of multiplex PCR with conventional culture for the isolation of S.P and H.I was performed on 112 specimens. The cross reactivity of multiplex PCR was also evaluated. RESULTS Of 181 cases, 81 cases were positive by multiplex PCR (44.8%): 52 cases for S.P (28.7%), 47 cases for H.I (26.0%), 9 cases for M.P (5.0%), 3 cases for B.P (1.7%) and 1 case for C.P (0.6%) including multiple infection cases. The agreement rates between multiplex PCR and culture for S.P and H.I were 92.9% (kappa index=0.84, P<0.001) and 91.1% (kappa index=0.75, P<0.001), respectively. There was no cross reactivity with common bacterial and viral pathogens.

We investigated the effects of EVT on the activities of daily living (ADL), handicap, gait, and eating in patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion who exhibited moderate to severe disability (score of 3-5 on the modified Rankin scale (mRS)) due to stroke, up to six months after onset. Materials and Methods: This retrospective longitudinal case-control study assessed 45 patients with MCA occlusion who exhibited moderate to severe disability (mRS score ≥ 3): 15 underwent EVT and 30 served as controls. Clinical assessments were conducted at two weeks (12-16 days), four weeks (26-30 days), and six months (180-210 days) after stroke onset. Functional assessments comprised the Korean version of the modified Barthel index (MBI), mRS, functional ambulation category (FAC), and dysphagia outcome severity scale (DOSS) to assess disability, handicap, gait, and eating. Results: The MBI, mRS, FAC, and DOSS scores all improved significantly (all p < 0.05) in the EVT group, compared to the controls. Conclusions: EVT has favorable effects on performing routine ADL, the handicap itself, walking, and eating. Therefore, EVT is recommended for patients with acute MCA occlusion, including those with severe disability at the initial assessment.","Yi, Ho-Jun; Lee, Dong-Hoon; Hong, Bo-Young; Song, Seung-Yoon; Yoo, Yeun-Jie; Yoon, Mi-Jeong; Sung, Jae-Hoon; Lim, Seong-Hoon",Medicina,https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57050509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34069555/,585

BACKGROUND A PCI is performed in about 25% of TAVR candidates, but procedural features and late outcomes of pre-TAVR PCI remain largely unknown. METHODS Multicenter study including 1197 consecutive patients who had PCI in the work-up pre-TAVR. A total of 1,705 lesions (1.5 ± 0.7 lesions per patient) were included. Death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) were recorded, as well as target lesion failure (TLF) and target vessel failure (TVF). RESULTS Half of patients exhibited a multivessel disease and the mean SYNTAX (SYNergy between PCI with TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery) score was 12.1 ± 9.1. The lesions were of B2/C type, calcified, bifurcation, and ostial in 49.9%, 45.8%, 21.4%, and 19.3% of cases, respectively. After a median follow-up of 2 (interquartile range: 1 to 3) years, a total of 444 (37.1%) patients presented an MACCE. Forty patients exhibited TVF (3.3%), with TLF identified in 32 (2.7%) patients. By multivariable analysis, previous peripheral artery disease (p < 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.002), atrial fibrillation (p = 0.003), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.012), and incomplete revascularization (p = 0.014) determined an increased risk of MACCE. In patients with unprotected left main or SYNTAX score >32 (n = 128), TLF, TVF, and MACCE rates were 3.9%, 6.3%, and 35.9%, respectively (p = 0.378; p = 0.065, and p = 0.847, respectively, vs. the rest of the population). CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing PCI in the work-up pre-TAVR frequently exhibited complex coronary lesions and multivessel disease. PCI was successful in most cases, and TLF and TVF rates at 2-year follow-up were low, also among patients with high-risk coronary features. However, overall MACCE occurred in about one-third of patients, with incomplete revascularization determining an increased risk. These results should inform future studies to better determine the optimal revascularization strategy pre-TAVR.","Faroux, Laurent; Campelo-Parada, Francisco; Munoz-Garcia, Erika; Nombela-Franco, Luis; Fischer, Quentin; Donaint, Pierre; Serra, Vicenç; Veiga, Gabriela; Gutiérrez, Enrique; Vilalta, Victoria; Alperi, Alberto; Regueiro, Ander; Asmarats, Lluis; Ribeiro, Henrique B; Matta, Anthony; Munoz-Garcia, Antonio; Armijo, German; Urena, Marina; Metz, Damien; Rodenas-Alesina, Eduard; de la Torre Hernandez, Jose Maria; Fernandez-Nofrerias, Eduard; Pascual, Isaac; Perez-Fuentes, Pedro; Arzamendi, Dabit; Campanha-Borges, Diego Carter; Del Val, David; Couture, Thomas; Rodés-Cabau, Josep",JACC.

Specifically, we achieve a faradaic efficiency as high as 57.7 and 52.0% for ethylene when the CuNWs are oxidized by the O2 from air and aqueous H2O2, respectively, and both of them show hydrogen selectivity below 12%. The high yields of C2+ products can be mainly attributed to the increase in surface roughness and the generation of defects and cavities during the electrochemical reduction of oxide layer. Our results also indicate that the formation of a relatively thick, smooth oxide sheath can improve the catalytic stability by mitigating the fragmentation issue.","Lyu, Zhiheng; Zhu, Shangqian; Xie, Minghao; Zhang, Yu; Chen, Zitao; Chen, Ruhui; Tian, Mengkun; Chi, Miaofang; Shao, Minhua; Xia, Younan",Angewandte Chemie,https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202011956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006809/,585

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency and correlates of ST in patients receiving DES, specifically examining the impact of risk factors modifiable by physician and patient behavior. METHODS AND RESULTS Assessment of Dual Anti-platelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents (ADAPT-DES) was a multicenter, prospective study in patients undergoing successful coronary intervention with DES in whom routine platelet reactivity testing was performed. Definite or probable ST occurred in 92 (1.1%) of 8582 patients within 2 years. Independent baseline correlates of ST included presentation with an acute coronary syndrome (hazard ratio [HR]=1.81, P=0.01), insulin-treated diabetes mellitus (HR=1.91, P=0.02), previous myocardial infarction (HR=1.75, P=0.02), and peripheral arterial disease (HR=2.01, P=0.01). Independent treatment-related correlates included use of early generation DES (HR=1.75, P=0.02), no procedural intravascular ultrasound guidance (HR=1.75, P=0.04), and premature discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy (HR=2.67, P=0.003); high platelet reactivity on clopidogrel trended as a correlate of ST (HR=1.49, P=0.08). The 2-year risk of ST ranged from 0.3% to 10.0% when 0 to 3 modifiable risk factors were present. CONCLUSIONS After successful DES implantation, ST occurred within 2 years in 1.1% of patients and was strongly associated with fixed and modifiable risk factors. The frequency of ST may be reduced with intravascular ultrasound -guided stenting, assiduous adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy, and adequate P2Y12 platelet receptor inhibition.

141576,Reply.,2021-01-01,"John Theophilus Desaguliers (1683-1744) was a French-born English Huguenot who made his name as a public lecturer in London and a demonstrator at the Royal Society, writing a very popular introduction to Isaac Newton's natural philosophy, the two-volume A course of experimental philosophy (1734-1744). This paper looks at the influence of three French natural philosophers, Edme Mariotte (1620-1684), Antoine Parent (1666-1716) and Bernard Forest de Bélidor (1698-1761), on the account of waterwheel functioning in the second volume of that work. The aim of the paper is to show that, although Desaguliers demonstrated a commitment to Newton's work, his own natural philosophical objectives also led him to borrow ideas from natural philosophers outside Newton's direct sphere of influence. To do this I shall give an account of what Desaguliers appropriated from Newton's Principia, how it fitted in with his own project and how he also made use of other natural philosophers' theories in his discussion of fluid mechanics. This will hopefully result in a more nuanced conception of Desaguliers' 'Newtonianism' that takes into account the diverse sources and influences in his work.","Morris, Andrew M A",Notes and records of the Royal Society of London,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsnr.2019.0023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831410/,585

It was creatively proposed that a disease prevention and control bureau should be set up outside the health commission to implement the vertical management at four levels, from national level to province-level, including autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government, city-level and district/county-level. The disease prevention and control bureau should consist of a strategic research institute, a center for disease prevention and control (CDC), a human resources training base, and a scientific research institute, which could perform their own duties and rely on each other. Enhancing the functions of strategic planning, overall coordination, and evidence-based decision-making in the original system, emphasizing the foresight and continuity of scientific research, and allowing the CDC to focus more on health management and emergency response could better facilitate in protecting the public health, improving the health and quality of life of the entire population, and guaranteeing the social stability and development.","Li, Y; Li, L; Niu, Y C; Sun, C H",Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112150-20200221-00159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388945/,585

DESIGN Retrospective observational and analytical cohort study. SETTING COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital between March and April 2020. PATIENTS 201 critically ill COVID-19 patients were included. Patients were categorized into three groups according to the highest anticoagulant dose received during hospitalization: prophylactic, intermediate and therapeutic. INTERVENTIONS The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), bleeding and mortality was compared between groups. We performed two logistic multivariable regressions to test the association between VTE and bleeding and the anticoagulant regimen. MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST VTE, bleeding and mortality. RESULTS 78 patients received prophylactic, 94 intermediate and 29 therapeutic doses. No differences in VTE and mortality were found, while bleeding events were more frequent in the therapeutic (31%) and intermediate (15%) dose group than in the prophylactic group (5%) (p<0.001 and p<0.05 respectively). The anticoagulant dose was the strongest determinant for bleeding (odds ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval 1.26-4.58, p=0.008) but had no impact on VTE. CONCLUSIONS Intermediate and therapeutic doses appear to have a higher risk of bleeding without a decrease of VTE events and mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Gabara, C; Solarat, B; Castro, P; Fernández, S; Badia, J R; Toapanta, D; Schulman, S; Reverter, J C; Soriano, A; Moisés, J; Aibar, J",Medicina intensiva,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medin.2021.07.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34465466/,585

143443,COVID-19: Planning and Postpandemic Partnerships.,2020-10-01,"INTRODUCTION Since the introduction of laparoscopic surgery, surgeons have not only been concerned about clinical outcomes, but also surgical scars. Although natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is promising, it is not applicable to clinical practice thus far due to safety concerns. As a transitional procedure between standard laparoscopic surgery and NOTES, single-port transumbilical laparoscopic surgery might be an ideal alternative. The main advantage of single-port transumbilical laparoscopic surgery is that it is performed with existing instruments. Thus, we applied single-port surgery for cholecystectomies and the clinical outcomes were analyzed. METHODS Between July and October 2008, 37 adults with gallbladder pathologies were enrolled in this study. Only one transumbilical incision was made for accessing the abdominal cavity and a multichannel port system was assembled with existing devices. Standard laparoscopic instruments were used to perform the cholecystectomy. RESULTS There were 13 males and 24 females. The mean age of the patients was 47.5 +/- 12.2 years. Twenty-nine patients had gallbladder stones, 7 patients had gallbladder polyps, and 1 patient had biliary dyskinesia. The mean operative time was 83.6 +/- 40.2 minutes. Gallbladder perforations occurred in 11 patients. In 5 patients, the procedure was converted to a standard laparoscopic technique due to technical difficulties. Complications occurred in 2 patients; specifically, a mesenteric injury was caused by the inadvertent grasping of the small-bowel mesentery during the removal of the wound retractor and an inadvertent injury of the right hepatic duct. The mean hospital stay was 2.7 +/- 1.5 days. CONCLUSIONS Our series has demonstrated the feasibility and safety of single-port transumbilical laparoscopic cholecystectomy. When technical difficulties arise, early conversion to a standard laparoscopic technique is advised to avoid serious complications. Additional studies randomizing standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy and single-port transumbilical cholecystectomy are necessary for defining the exact role of this procedure.","Kuon Lee, Sang; You, Young Kyoung; Park, Jung Hyun; Kim, Hyung-Jin; Lee, Kyung Keun; Kim, Dong Goo",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Usually, it occurs in patients admitted in intensive care unit, that associate severe surgical or medical pathologies. The mechanism of the ACPO has not been completely explained, but it is assumed that the motor function of the colon may be affected, as a result of autonomic regulation disturbance. Early diagnosis and treatment help reduce the risk of severe outcome, such as ischemia or perforation. Material and Method: In addition to our experience, a literature search was elaborated in order to evaluate the incidence, the etiology, the clinical presentation and the diagnosis of the ACPO.

Two questions guided the scoping review: What is the effect of universal emergency department screening compared to targeted screening or usual practice on cases of elder abuse identified, safety outcomes, and health care utilization?; and What is the safety, health, legal, and psychosocial impact of emergency department-based interventions vs. usual care for patients experiencing elder abuse? We searched five article databases. Additional material was located through reference lists of identified publications, PsychInfo, and Google Scholar. The results were discussed in a consensus conference; and stakeholders voted to prioritize research questions. No studies were identified that directly addressed the first question regarding assessment strategies, but four instruments used for elder abuse screening in the emergency department were identified. For the second question, we located six articles on interventions for elder abuse in the emergency department; however, none directly addressed the question of comparative effectiveness. Based on these findings, GEAR participants identified five questions as priorities for future research - two related to screening, two related to intervention, and one encompassed both. In sum, research to identify best practices for elder abuse assessment and intervention in emergency departments is still needed.

Current treatments are only partially effective, and new therapies targeting viral and host pathways are required. Virus entry into a host cell provides a conserved target for therapeutic intervention. Tetraspanin CD81, scavenger receptor class B member I, and the tight-junction proteins claudin-1 and occludin have been identified as essential entry receptors. Limited information is available on the role of receptor trafficking in HCV entry. We demonstrate here that anti-CD81 antibodies inhibit HCV infection at late times after virus internalization, suggesting a role for intracellular CD81 in HCV infection. Several tetraspanins have been reported to internalize via motifs in their C-terminal cytoplasmic domains; however, CD81 lacks such motifs, leading several laboratories to suggest a limited role for CD81 endocytosis in HCV entry. We demonstrate CD81 internalization via a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent process, independent of its cytoplasmic domain, suggesting a role for associated partner proteins in regulating CD81 trafficking. Live cell imaging demonstrates CD81 and claudin-1 coendocytosis and fusion with Rab5 expressing endosomes, supporting a role for this receptor complex in HCV internalization. Receptor-specific antibodies and HCV particles increase CD81 and claudin-1 endocytosis, supporting a model wherein HCV stimulates receptor trafficking to promote particle internalization.","Farquhar, Michelle J; Hu, Ke; Harris, Helen J; Davis, Christopher; Brimacombe, Claire L; Fletcher, Sarah J; Baumert, Thomas F; Rappoport, Joshua Z; Balfe, Peter; McKeating, Jane A",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.06996-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22318146/,585

STUDY DESIGN Prospective clinical trial. ANIMALS Sixteen healthy client-owned female dogs undergoing routine single-port LapOVE. METHODS Anesthetized dogs were placed in dorsal recumbency on a tilting operation table. The operating laparoscope was introduced and, after inspection of abdominal organs, directed toward the randomly assigned ovary. Fifteen-second video recordings were taken at each table rotation of 0°, 22.5°, and 45°. LapOVE was performed using the single-port technique. The procedure was repeated on the contralateral side. Blinded observers (3 inexperienced [IO], 3 experienced [EO], 1 expert [EE]) evaluated the recordings postoperatively for visibility of ovary/ovarian bursa, ovario-uterine transition, and other organs. RESULTS In the 0° position, ovarian structures were rarely visualized (IO, 13/96 [13.5%]; EO, 7/96 [7.3%]; EE, 5/32 [15.6%]). In the 22.5° position, visualization improved significantly for EO (26/96 [27.1%], P < .001). There was a marked improvement in visualization for all groups when the positioning angle was altered to 45° (IO, 62/96 [64.6%]; EO, 67/96 [69.8%]; EE, 25/32 [78.1%]). The differences between 0° and 45° and between 22.5° and 45° were significant for all groups of observers (all P < .001). There was an advantage for ovary visualization when procedures were started with left ovariectomy. CONCLUSION The 45° table rotation provided the best ovary visualization, regardless of body side or observer experience. There is evidence that procedures should be started with the left ovary when body side declination is used for organ retraction from the ovaries.","Liehmann, Lea M; Seny, Tanja; Dupré, Gilles",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12764; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29247534/,585

149003,Cultivating change: Engaging residents in research.,2020-09-01,"Research on the genomics of adaptation is rapidly changing. In the last few decades, progress in this area has been driven by methodological advances, not only in the way increasingly large amounts of molecular data are generated (e.g. with high-throughput sequencing), but also in the way these data are analysed. This includes a growing appreciation and quantitative treatment of covariation among units within the same data type (e.g. genes) or across data types (e.g. genes and phenotypes). The development and adoption of more and more integrative tools have resulted in richer and more interesting empirical work. This special issue - comprising methodological, empirical, and review papers - aims to capture a 'snapshot' of this rapidly evolving field. We discuss in particular three important themes in the study of adaptation: the genetic architecture of adaptive variation, protein-coding and regulatory changes, and parallel evolution. We highlight how more traditional key themes in the study of genetic architecture (e.g. the number of loci underlying adaptive traits and the distribution of their effects) are now being complemented by other factors (e.g. how patterns of linkage and number of loci interact to affect the ability to adapt). Similarly, apart from addressing the relative importance of protein-coding and regulatory changes, we now have the tools to look in-depth at specific types of regulatory variation to gain a clearer picture of regulatory networks. Finally, parallel evolution has always been central to the study of adaptation, but now we are often able to address the question of whether - and to what extent - parallelism at the organismal or phenotypic level is matched by parallelism at the genetic level. Perhaps most importantly, we can now determine what mechanisms are driving parallelism (or lack thereof) across levels of biological organization. All these recent methodological developments open up new directions for future studies of adaptive changes across traits, levels of biological organization, demographic contexts and time scales.","Fruciano, Carmelo; Franchini, Paolo; Jones, Julia C",Journal of evolutionary biology,https://doi.org/10.1111/jeb.13871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34145685/,585

MATERIALS AND METHODS 123 surgical wounds were prospectively followed up after closure with a bidirectional barbed suture. The cohort represented a large range of patient ages and co-morbidities, as well as incision length and locations. RESULTS Complication rates were low in this large cohort. The total complication rate was 6.5% (8 wounds). One wound (0.8%) had a major infection that needed further surgery, and 2 wounds (1.6%) showed inflammatory related complications.

Information about the contribution of interhospital transfer in improving access to EVT will help organize regional systems of stroke care. METHODS We analyzed trends of transfer-in EVT from a cohort of 1 863 693 patients with ischemic stroke admitted to 2143 Get With The Guidelines-Stroke participating hospitals between January 2012 and December 2017. We further examined the association between arrival mode and in-hospital outcomes by using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS Of the 37 260 patients who received EVT at 639 hospitals during the study period, 42.9% (15 975) arrived at the EVT-providing hospital after interhospital transfer. Transfer-in EVT cases increased from 256 in the first quarter 2012 to 1422 in the fourth quarter 2017, with sharply accelerated increases following the fourth quarter 2014 ( P<0.001 for change in linear trend). Transfer-in patients were younger and more likely to be of white race, to arrive during off-hours, and to be treated at comprehensive stroke centers. Transfer-in patients had significantly longer last-known-well-to-EVT initiation time (median, 289 minutes versus 213 minutes; absolute standardized difference, 67.33) but were more likely to have door-to-EVT initiation time of ≤90 minutes (65.6% versus 23.6%; absolute standardized difference, 93.18). In-hospital outcomes were worse for transfer-in patients undergoing EVT in unadjusted and in risk-adjusted models. Although the difference in in-hospital mortality disappeared after adjusting for delay in EVT initiation (14.7% versus 13.4%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.92-1.11), transfer-in patients were still more likely to develop symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (7.0% versus 5.7%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.29) and less likely to have either independent ambulation at discharge (33.1% versus 37.1%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.95) or to be discharged to home (24.3% versus 29.1%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.76-0.88). CONCLUSIONS Interhospital transfer for EVT is increasingly common and is associated with a significant delay in EVT initiation highlighting the need to develop more efficient stroke systems of care. Further evaluation to identify factors that impact EVT outcomes for transfer-in patients is warranted.","Shah, Shreyansh; Xian, Ying; Sheng, Shubin; Zachrison, Kori S; Saver, Jeffrey L; Sheth, Kevin N; Fonarow, Gregg C; Schwamm, Lee H; Smith, Eric E",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.118.036509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700144/,585
150931,"A comprehensive hospital agile preparedness (CHAPs) tool for pandemic preparedness, based on the COVID-19 experience.",2020-06-01,"Concussion is a frequent injury in many sports and is also common in para athletes. However, there is a paucity of concussion research related to para sport, and prior International Concussion in Sport (CIS) consensus papers have not substantively addressed this population. To remedy this and to improve concussion care provided to para athletes, the concussion in para sport (CIPS) multidisciplinary expert group was created. This group analysed and discussed in-depth para athlete-specific issues within the established key clinical domains of the current (2017) consensus statement on CIS. Due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the group held all meetings by video conferencing. The existing Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 5 (SCAT5) for the immediate on-field and office-based off-field assessment of concussion was evaluated as part of this process, to identify any para athlete-specific concerns. Regular preparticipation and periodic health examinations are essential to determine a baseline reference point for concussion symptoms but pose additional challenges for the interpreting clinician. Further considerations for concussion management for the para athlete are required within the remove, rest, reconsider and refer consensus statement framework. Considering return to sport (RTS), the 2017 CIS consensus statement has limitations when considering the RTS of the para athlete. Case-by-case decision making related to RTS following concussion is imperative for para athletes. Additional challenges exist for the evaluation and management of concussion in para athletes. There is a need for greater understanding of existing knowledge gaps and attitudes towards concussion among athlete medical staff, coaches and para athletes. Future research should investigate the use and performance of common assessment tools in the para athlete population to better guide their clinical application and inform potential modifications. Concussion prevention strategies and sport-specific rule changes, such as in Para Alpine Skiing and Cerebral Palsy Football, also should be carefully considered to reduce the occurrence of concussion in para athletes.","Weiler, Richard; Blauwet, Cheri; Clarke, David; Dalton, Kristine; Derman, Wayne; Fagher, Kristina; Gouttebarge, Vincent; Kissick, James; Lee, Kenneth; Lexell, Jan; Van de Vliet, Peter; Verhagen, Evert; Webborn, Nick; Ahmed, Osman Hassan",British journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2020-103696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33837003/,585

152006,Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19): what speech therapists should know.,2020,"Unexplained fever (UF) is a common problem in children under 3 years old. Although virus infection is suspected to be the cause of most of these fevers, a comprehensive analysis of viruses in samples from children with fever and healthy controls is important for establishing a relationship between viruses and UF. We used unbiased, deep sequencing to analyze 176 nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) and plasma samples from children with UF and afebrile controls, generating an average of 4.6 million sequences per sample. An analysis pipeline was developed to detect viral sequences, which resulted in the identification of sequences from 25 viral genera. These genera included expected pathogens, such as adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and roseoloviruses, plus viruses with unknown pathogenicity. Viruses that were unexpected in NP and plasma samples, such as the astrovirus MLB-2, were also detected. Sequencing allowed identification of virus subtype for some viruses, including roseoloviruses. Highly sensitive PCR assays detected low levels of viruses that were not detected in approximately 5 million sequences, but greater sequencing depth improved sensitivity. On average NP and plasma samples from febrile children contained 1.5- to 5-fold more viral sequences, respectively, than samples from afebrile children. Samples from febrile children contained a broader range of viral genera and contained multiple viral genera more frequently than samples from children without fever. Differences between febrile and afebrile groups were most striking in the plasma samples, where detection of viral sequence may be associated with a disseminated infection. These data indicate that virus infection is associated with UF. Further studies are important in order to establish the range of viral pathogens associated with fever and to understand of the role of viral infection in fever.

Samples were available from 148 SARS-CoV-2 real time RT-PCR positive and 73 SARS-CoV-2 real time RT-PCR negative oropharyngeal swabs. For determination of technical sensitivity SARS-CoV-2 virus culture material was used. The samples were treated with lysis buffer and analyzed using both an in-house and a pre-commercial SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen assay on Simoa. Both nucleocapsid antigen assays have a technical sensitivity corresponding to around 100 SARS-CoV-2 RNA molecules/mL. Using a cut-off at 0.1 pg/mL the pre-commercial SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen assay had a sensitivity of 96% (95% CI 91.4-98.5%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI 95.1-100%). In comparison the in-house nucleocapsid antigen assay had sensitivity of 95% (95% CI 89.3-98.1%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 95.1-100%) using a cut-off at 0.01 pg/mL. The two SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen assays correlated with r = 0.91 (P < 0.0001). The in-house and the pre-commercial SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen assay demonstrated technical and clinical sensitivity comparable to real-time RT-PCR methods for identifying SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and thus can be used clinically as well as serve as a reference method for antigen Point of Care Testing.,"Olsen, Dorte Aa; Brasen, Claus L; Kahns, Søren; Madsen, Jeppe B; Kierkegaard, Helene; Christensen, Henry; Jensen, Anders; Sydenham, Thomas V; Møller, Jens K; Madsen, Jonna S; Brandslund, Ivan",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-99807-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34645907/,585

OBJECTIVE To determine the association of microRNA (miRNA)-10b and serum levels of IL-2 and IL-8 in patients with COVID-19. METHODS Blood samples were obtained from 33 COVID-19 patients and 29 healthy subjects. After RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, the transcript level of miR-10b was determined by Real-time PCR. In addition, the serum levels of IL-2 and IL-8 were measured in subjects using ELISA. RESULTS The patient group comprised of 33 patients with COVID-19 (62.4 ± 3.7 years old), 13 (39%) males and 20 (61%) females. In the control group, 29 subjects (56.6 ± 1.6 years old), 9 (31%) males and 20 (69%) females, were included. The expression of miR-10b was significantly downregulated in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients in comparison to the healthy controls (fold change= 0.12, P< 0.0001). The levels of IL-2 (P< 0.001) and IL-8 (P< 0.001) were significantly increased in the serum samples of COVID-19 patients compared to the healthy subjects. The expression level of miR-10b was correlated significantly with the serum levels of IL-2 and IL-8 as well as with the age of patients, ESR and CRP levels. CONCLUSIONS miR-10b is downregulated in the COVID-19 patients and might result in increased levels of IL-2 and IL-8, hence contributing to cytokine storm.","Bagheri-Hosseinabadi, Zahra; Ostad Ebrahimi, Hamid; Bahrehmand, Fatemeh; Taghipour, Gholamhosein; Abbasifard, Mitra",Iranian journal of immunology : IJI,https://doi.org/10.22034/iji.2021.88780.1904; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33787515/,585

As the intracellular NADH:NAD+ ratio can be in near equilibrium with the circulating lactate:pyruvate ratio, we hypothesized that reductive stress could be alleviated by oxidizing extracellular lactate to pyruvate. We engineered LOXCAT, a fusion of bacterial lactate oxidase (LOX) and catalase (CAT), which irreversibly converts lactate and oxygen to pyruvate and water. Addition of purified LOXCAT to the medium of cultured human cells with a defective electron transport chain decreased the extracellular lactate:pyruvate ratio, normalized the intracellular NADH:NAD+ ratio, upregulated glycolytic ATP production and restored cellular proliferation. In mice, tail-vein-injected LOXCAT lowered the circulating lactate:pyruvate ratio, blunted a metformin-induced rise in blood lactate:pyruvate ratio and improved NADH:NAD+ balance in the heart and brain. Our study lays the groundwork for a class of injectable therapeutic enzymes that alleviates intracellular redox imbalances by directly targeting circulating redox-coupled metabolites.","Patgiri, Anupam; Skinner, Owen S; Miyazaki, Yusuke; Schleifer, Grigorij; Marutani, Eizo; Shah, Hardik; Sharma, Rohit; Goodman, Russell P; To, Tsz-Leung; Robert Bao, Xiaoyan; Ichinose, Fumito; Zapol, Warren M; Mootha, Vamsi K",Nature biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-019-0377-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31932725/,585

A major shift to telemedicine and mobile health technologies has now taken on an immediate urgency. Newly developed devices designed for home use have facilitated remote monitoring of various physiologic parameters relevant to pulmonary diseases. These devices have also enabled home-based pulmonary rehabilitation programs. In addition, telemedicine and home care services have been leveraged to rapidly develop acute care hospital-at-home programs for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 illness. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY The benefit of remote monitoring technologies on patient outcomes has not been established in robust trials. Furthermore, the use of these devices, which can increase the burden of care, has not been integrated into current clinical workflows and electronic medical records. Finally, reimbursement for these telemedicine and remote monitoring services is variable. DATA SOURCES Literature review. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES Advances in digital technology have improved remote monitoring of physiologic parameters relevant to pulmonary medicine. In addition, telemedicine services for the provision of pulmonary rehabilitation and novel hospital-at-home programs have been developed. These new home-based programs have been adapted for COVID-19 and may also be relevant for the management of acute and chronic pulmonary diseases after the pandemic. CONCLUSION Digital remote monitoring of physiologic parameters relevant to pulmonary medicine and novel hospital-at-home programs are feasible and may improve care for patients with acute and chronic respiratory-related disorders.","Ilowite, Jonathan; Lisker, Gita; Greenberg, Harly",American journal of therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1097/mjt.0000000000001342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33590991/,585

Firstly, by the basic reproduction number R0, the globally asymptotically stable of the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium were proved. Then, based on the reported epidemic data of Hubei Province from January 26 to February 13, numerical simulations are used to verify the analysis results, and the impact of peak time and the scale of disease transmission were mainly considered with different information implementation rate and the contact rate. It was shown that with the decrease of information implementation rate, the peak of confirmed cases would be delayed to reach, and would increase significantly.

METHODS We systematically searched for qualitative and quantitative studies that explored stakeholder views on SF in WES/WGS. Framework analysis was undertaken to identify major themes. RESULTS Forty-four articles reporting the views of 11,566 stakeholders were included. Stakeholders were broadly supportive of returning ""actionable"" findings, but definitions of actionability varied. Stakeholder views on SF disclosure exist along a spectrum: potential WES/WGS recipients' views were largely influenced by a sense of rights, whereas views of genomics professionals were informed by a sense of professional responsibility. Experience with genetic illness and testing resulted in greater caution about SF, suggesting that truly informed decisions require an understanding of the implications and limitations of WES/WGS and possible findings. CONCLUSION This review suggests that bidirectional interaction during consent might best facilitate informed decision making about SF and that dynamic forms of consent, allowing for changing preferences, should be considered. Research exploring views from wider perspectives and from recipients who have received SF is critical if evidence-based policies are to be achieved.Genet Med 19 3, 283-293.","Mackley, Michael P; Fletcher, Benjamin; Parker, Michael; Watkins, Hugh; Ormondroyd, Elizabeth",Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,https://doi.org/10.1038/gim.2016.109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27584911/,585

However, it is unclear whether this process occurs similarly in humans and whether it comprises a dedicated subset of innate-like type 3 effector γδ T cells. Here, we present a protocol for high-throughput sequencing of TRG and TRD pairs that comprise the clonal γδTCR. In combination with single-cell RNA sequencing, multiparameter flow cytometry, and TCR sequencing, we reveal a high heterogeneity of γδ T cells sorted from neonatal and adult blood that correlated with TCR usage. Immature γδ T cell clusters displayed mixed and diverse TCRs, but effector cell types segregated according to the expression of either highly expanded individual Vδ1+ TCRs or moderately expanded semi-invariant Vγ9Vδ2+ TCRs. The Vγ9Vδ2+ T cells shared expression of genes that mark innate-like T cells, including ZBTB16 (encoding PLZF), KLRB1, and KLRC1, but consisted of distinct clusters with unrelated Vγ9Vδ2+ TCR clones characterized either by TBX21, FCGR3A, and cytotoxicity-associated gene expression (type 1) or by CCR6, RORC, IL23R, and DPP4 expression (type 3). Effector γδ T cells with type 1 and type 3 innate T cell signatures were detected in a public dataset of early embryonic thymus organogenesis.

A consistent definition of what constitutes early functional rehabilitation has not been established across the literature, despite studies supporting its efficacy. A standardized definition would be helpful to pool data across studies, allow for between-study comparisons, and ultimately work toward developing clinical guidelines. Purpose To define early functional rehabilitation (including when it is initiated and what it entails) when used to treat Achilles tendon rupture and to identify outcome measures for evaluating the effect of treatment. Study Design Systematic review; Level of evidence, 4. Methods Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PEDro, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant studies. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies consisted of randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case series (≥10 participants) including weightbearing or exercise-based interventions within 8 weeks after Achilles tendon rupture. Results A total of 174 studies published between 1979 and 2018 were included. Studies were rated a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 17 (15-20) on the Downs & Black checklist and included 9098 participants. Early functional rehabilitation incorporated weightbearing (95%), range of motion (73%), and isometric/strengthening exercises (50%). Weightbearing was initiated within the first week, whereas exercise (eg, ankle range of motion, strengthening, whole-body conditioning) was initiated in the second week. Initiation of exercises varied based on whether treatment was nonsurgical (mean, 3.0 weeks; IQR, 2.0-4.0 weeks) or simple (mean, 2.0 weeks; IQR, 0.0-2.3 weeks) or augmented surgical repair (mean, 0.5 weeks; IQR, 0.0-2.8 weeks) (P = .017). Functional outcomes including ankle range of motion (n = 84) and strength (n = 76) were reported in 130 studies. Other outcome domains included patient-reported outcomes (n = 89), survey-based functional outcomes (n = 50), and tendon properties (n = 53). Conclusion Early functional rehabilitation includes weightbearing and a variety of exercise-based interventions initiated within the first 2 weeks after acute Achilles tendon rupture/repair. Because early functional rehabilitation has lacked a standardized definition, interventions and outcome measures are highly variable, and pooling data across studies should be done with attention paid to what was included in the intervention and how treatment was assessed.","Zellers, Jennifer A; Christensen, Marianne; Kjær, Inge Lunding; Rathleff, Michael Skovdal; Silbernagel, Karin Grävare",Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/2325967119884071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31803789/,585

METHOD In all, 135 patients were randomized to treatment with a PPH-01/03 (Ethicon EndoSurgery) or an EEA (Covidien) stapler. They were reviewed after a minimum follow-up of 4 years to determine the rate of recurrent mucosal prolapse and general condition (wellness evaluation score). Postoperative bowel dysfunction was assessed using the Rome III criteria. RESULTS Eighty-seven (65%) of the 135 patients (48 in the EEA stapler group and 37 in the PPH group) were available for long-term follow-up. The two groups were comparable for age, gender and duration of follow-up (mean 49.3 ± 5.4 months and 49.0 ± 5.3 months respectively). In the EEA group, 11 (23%) patients had some degree of recurrent prolapse compared with 12 (32%) in the PPH group (P = 0.409). Persistence of anal bleeding was significantly higher in the PPH group (P = 0.04) while the postoperative Haemorrhoid Symptom Score was significantly better in the EEA group (1.73 ± 1.65 vs 3.17 ± 1.94, P < 0.001).

Furthermore, 7 (15%) of the patients in the EEA group complained of some evacuation disturbance compared with 13 (36%) in the PPH group (P = 0.021). CONCLUSION The study failed to demonstrate any significant difference in the long-term recurrence rate of Stage III haemorrhoids using EEA or PPH. Nevertheless, use of the larger volume EEA provides better symptom resolution compared with PPH.","Altomare, D F; Pecorella, G; Tegon, G; Aquilino, F; Pennisi, D; De Fazio, M",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.13549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27801539/,585

RESULTS Ten eligible articles, three qualitative, three quantitative, three mixed-method and one narrative review, were identified. Referral criteria were mainly based on patient characteristics such as diagnosis. The specialist services involved a variety of activities and outcomes and descriptions were often lacking. Services could be improved regarding the information flow between healthcare professionals, greater in-depth palliative care knowledge for case managers and social workers, identification of a key worker and support for family carers.

METHODS Thirty participants completed surveys to determine their predisposed attitudes of teamwork and CSR. They then viewed three versions of a safety presentation each addressing the same topic and information, but each with a different theme behind their safety message (i.e. control, teamwork, and CSR). RESULTS The pooled teamwork and CSR data showed that these messages were favored in larger proportion than the control message. No statistically significant differences were found between the three messages when analyzed individually. CONCLUSIONS ANOVA analyses showed a significant difference between the control presentation data and the pooled teamwork and CSR presentation data indicating that millennials prefer safety messages aligned with teamwork and social responsibility to a safety message with no extrinsic motivational theme.","Clark, Tyler Lee; Schwerha, Diana J",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-203226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831214/,585

Published preoperative risk factors predicting postoperative morbidity may be used to predict FT need and associated intraoperative placement. METHODS A retrospective review of patients who underwent PD during 2005-2011 was performed by querying the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database with specific procedure codes. Patients were categorized based on how many of 10 possible preoperative risk factors they demonstrated. Groups of patients with scores of ≤ 1 (low) and ≥ 2 (high), respectively, were compared for FT need, length of stay (LoS) and organ space surgical site infections (SSIs). RESULTS Of 138 PD patients, 82 did not have an FT placed intraoperatively, and, of those, 16 (19.5%) required delayed FT placement. High-risk patients were more likely to require a delayed FT (29.3%) compared with low-risk patients (9.8%) (P = 0.026). The 16 patients who required a delayed FT had a median LoS of 15.5 days, whereas the 66 patients who did not require an FT had a median LoS of 8 days (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In this analysis, subjects considered as high-risk patients were more likely to require an FT than low-risk patients.

Since inhibitors of Mek1/2 and Gsk3β (2i) can enhance pluripotency maintenance, effects of 2i-based medium on the cultivation of bovine prospermatogonia from the cryopreserved tissues were examined. The testicular tissues of newborn bulls were well cryopreserved. High mRNA levels of prospermatogonium/SSC markers (PLZF, GFRα-1) and pluripotency markers (Oct4/Pouf5, Sox2, Nanog) were detected and the PLZF+ /GFRα-1+ prospermatogonia were consistently identified immunohistochemically in the seminiferous cords. Using differential plating and Percoll-based centrifugation, 41.59% prospermatogonia were enriched and they proliferated robustly in 2i medium.

162425,Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic: the aftermath on livestock products processing and distribution chain - a review. (Special Issue: Covid-19 and climate change.),2021,"Objective Thoracic ultrasound has been shown to be useful in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pulmonary involvement. Several scores for quantifying the degree of involvement have been described, although there is no evidence to show that they have any capacity for predicting unfavorable progress. Methodology Prospective cohort study of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The sample was stratified according to clinical course, and patients requiring invasive or non-invasive respiratory support were classified as having unfavorable progress. Biomarkers were analyzed at admission and on the same day that thoracic ultrasound was performed. Prognostic scales were also determined at admission. The ultrasound score was obtained in 8 or 14 areas, depending on the patient's ability to sit. Results We included 44 patients, 13 (29,5%) of whom subsequently needed ventilatory support. Eight areas were explored in all patients and 14 areas in 35 (79.5%). The most affected areas were the posterior lower lobes. Significant differences were found between the 2 groups on the SOFA and quick SOFA multidimensional scales, and PCR and LDH on the same day as thoracic ultrasound, and the ultrasound scores. The best area under the ROC curve (AUC) was obtained with the 14-area score, with a result of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.75-0.99). Its sensitivity and specificity for a cut-off score of 13.5 were 100% and 61.5%, respectively. Conclusions The use of scores to quantify lung involvement measured by thoracic ultrasound provides useful information, facilitating risk stratification in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Ramos Hernández, Cristina; Botana Rial, Maribel; Pazos Area, Luis Alberto; Núñez Fernández, Marta; Pérez Fernández, Silvia; Rubianes González, Martín; Crespo Casal, Manuel; Fernández Villar, Alberto",Archivos de bronconeumologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2020.07.043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34629648/,585

162806,Fear & anxiety in the time of COVID-19: How they influence behavior,2020,"Purpose Domestic abuse or intimate partner violence is a term that describes a pattern of abusive behaviours, often experienced concurrently and linked to gender-based violence. This study aims to explore through the literature the potential to design effective digital services that work for victims, survivors and those who provide domestic abuse support services. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a systems or service design thinking methodology which was adopted during a Scottish Government-funded Technology Enabled Care (TEC) pathfinder project on domestic abuse. This methodology is the basis for the Scottish Approach to Service Design which is based on the Design Council Double Diamond. During the first phase, known as the discovery phase, desk-based research is conducted by the service design team to inform their approach to the later phases (the second half of the first diamond is define whilst design and deliver form the second diamond). Time is spent during discovery to unpack the complexity whilst the approach takes a pragmatic worldview. Findings Technology has yet to be shown to provide an effective solution to any aspect of the victim or survivors' experience or support services albeit these are often over-stretched and under-funded even without the Covid-19 pandemic. Digital abuse is increasing with perpetrators adapting new technologies. Digital developments should be grounded on ethical design principles. Research limitations/implications This study is the result of the desk-based research during a TEC project considering the potential role of technology in tackling domestic abuse. Limitations include only including evidence from the literature;interviews were conducted but are not reported here. Another limitation is the pragmatic rather than academic nature of the approach;it was to be a foundation for service re-design. So hopefully useful for new practitioners to immerse themselves in the topic area but with no claims to be reproducible as would be the case in a formal review. Practical implications All the evidence shows the authors need to keep trying different approaches, different forms of engagement and ways to empower survivors. Could technology support health-care practitioners to consistently use sensitive routine enquiry? Perhaps enable independent domestic violence advisors to attend more multidisciplinary team meetings in local community settings? Meanwhile, digital abuse is increasing with perpetrators adapting new technologies. Technology has not yet provided a digital solution which is practical and meets the needs of the broad intersectional population affected by domestic abuse nor those who provide support. If the future is to be based on digital developments it must be grounded on ethical design principles. Originality/value This desk-based review collates the current national and international policy and research literature whilst focusing on digital developments which support those affected by domestic abuse.","MacLure, K.; Jones, A.",Journal of Adult Protection,https://doi.org/10.1108/jap-03-2021-0009,585
162943,Assessing Spatial Equity of Public Transit Demand amid COVID-19,2021,"Statistical modeling is commonly used to relate the performance of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) to fertilizer requirements. Prescribing optimal nutrient doses is challenging because of the involvement of many variables including weather, soils, land management, genotypes, and severity of pests and diseases. Where sufficient data are available, machine learning algorithms can be used to predict crop performance. The objective of this study was to predict tuber yield and quality (size and specific gravity) as impacted by nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilization as well as weather, soils and land management variables. We exploited a data set of 273 field experiments conducted from 1979 to 2017 in Quebec (Canada). We developed, evaluated and compared predictions from a hierarchical Mitscherlich model, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, neuronal networks and Gaussian processes. Machine learning models returned R2 values of 0.49–0.59 for tuber marketable yield prediction, which were higher than the Mitscherlich model R2 (0.37). The models were more likely to predict medium-size tubers (R2 = 0.60–0.69) and tuber specific gravity (R2 = 0.58–0.67) than large-size tubers (R2 = 0.55–0.64) and marketable yield. Response surfaces from the Mitscherlich model, neural networks and Gaussian processes returned smooth responses that agreed more with actual evidence than discontinuous curves derived from k-nearest neighbors and random forest models. When marginalized to obtain optimal dosages from dose-response surfaces given constant weather, soil and land management conditions, some disagreements occurred between models. Due to their built-in ability to develop recommendations within a probabilistic risk-assessment framework, Gaussian processes stood out as the most promising algorithm to support decisions that minimize economic or agronomic risks.","Coulibali, Zonlehoua; Cambouris, Athyna Nancy; Parent, Serge-Étienne",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.12.988626,585
163176,Navigating the Intimate Unknown: Vulnerability as an Affective Relation,2021,"Natural populations often show enhanced genetic drift consistent with a strong skew in their offspring number distribution. The skew arises because the variability of family sizes is either inherently strong or amplified by population expansions, leading to so-called ‘jackpot’ events. The resulting allele frequency fluctuations are large and, therefore, challenge standard models of population genetics, which assume sufficiently narrow offspring distributions. While the neutral dynamics backward in time can be readily analyzed using coalescent approaches, we still know little about the effect of broad offspring distributions on the dynamics forward in time, especially with selection. Here, we employ an exact asymptotic analysis combined with a scaling hypothesis to demonstrate that over-dispersed frequency trajectories emerge from the competition of conventional forces, such as selection or mutations, with an emerging time-dependent sampling bias against the minor allele. The sampling bias arises from the characteristic time-dependence of the largest sampled family size within each allelic type. Using this insight, we establish simple scaling relations for allele frequency fluctuations, fixation probabilities, extinction times, and the site frequency spectra that arise when offspring numbers are distributed according to a power law n−(1+α). To demonstrate that this coarse-grained model captures a wide variety of non-equilibrium dynamics, we validate our results in traveling waves, where the phenomenon of ‘gene surfing’ can produce any exponent 1 < α < 2. We argue that the concept of a dynamic sampling bias is useful generally to develop both intuition and statistical tests for the unusual dynamics of populations with skewed offspring distributions, which can confound commonly used tests for selection or demographic history.","Okada, Takashi; Hallatschek, Oskar",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.09.434663,585

163435,Impact of COVID-19 on Travel Behavior and Shared Mobility Systems,2020,"Background: Serology could help defining the real extent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) diffusion in the population, especially in individuals considered at higher risk of SARS-CoV2 infection (COVID-19), such as Spondiloarthritis (SpA) patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy or health care workers (HCW). In fact, COVID-19 detection is complicated by the fact that many patients can be asymptomatic. In these cases, it has also been suggested that a weaker immune response might be elicited. In this context, the role of anti-cytokine targeted therapy -commonly used as treatment in SpA-is uncertain, as it is not clear whether it is detrimental or protective towards severe disease forms. Objectives: The aim of the study was to explore the potential role of serology in detecting previous contact with SARS-CoV2 in SpA patients and HCW, and compare the frequency of positive findings with a control population. Methods: Consecutive patients affected by axial or peripheral SpA, classified according to Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) criteria and undergoing cytokine-targeted therapy, as well as HCW and controls from the pre-COVID-19 era (control group, 2015) were recruited. In SpA patients, disease activity was assessed by Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) and Disease Activity Score on 28-joint-count (DAS28). Sera from all patients were analysed through chemiluminescent analytical system (CLIA) for the presence of IgG and IgM anti-SARS-CoV2. Patients with a positive serological test (either IgM or IgG) additionally underwent real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) in nasopharyngeal swabs in order to test for active infection. In SpA patients, serology was repeated after 3 months. Data across the 3 groups were compared by ANOVA or Chi-square, while comparison between 2 groups were conducted by Wilcoxon signed rank test or Chi-Square, for continuous and categorical data respectively. P ≤ 0.05 were considered as significant. Results: A total of 396 patients were recruited: 200 SpA, 95 HCW and 101 healthy controls. SpA patients were mostly (54%) males, with mean age 49.6 ±14.7 years, and all were treated with anti-TNFα (78%), anti-IL-17 (9%) and anti-IL-23 drugs (7%), or small molecules (6%). Their disease activity level was moderate-low as assessed by ASDAS (1.95 ±0.98) and DAS28 (2.33 ±2.02). Among HCW and controls, 35% and 62% were male, with mean age 46.7 ±12.9 and 50.6±10.6 respectively. Positive serology (IgM or IgG, or both) was found in 12.5% SpA patients, 8.4% HCW, 0% controls (p=0.001). Among these, IgM titres were higher in the SpA group than in HCW (2.76±2.94 versus 0.80±0.67 KU/L, p= 0.016), while IgG mean titres were lower in the SpA group than in HCW (0.88±3.18 KU/L versus 1.05±0.88, p= 0.035). SpA patients with positive serology more frequently reported COVID-19 like symptoms than those with negative serology (20% vs 4%, p=0.009) and 2 had COVID-19 as confirmed by RT-PCR, none with a severe disease course. None of the HCW reported symptoms or tested positive by RT-PCR. In the SpA patients, at 3 months, the mean IgM titre decreased from 2.76±2.93 to 2.38±2.95 (p=0.001), while the IgG titres decreased from 0.89±3.25 to 0.31±0.87 (p=ns). Interestingly, the IgM or IgG titer at a single-patient level did not seem to change much in terms of absolute value (Figure 1), except in one patient, with documented COVID-19 (positive RT-PCR), in whom IgG level even decreased at 3 months. Conclusion: Serology revealed that exposure to COVID-19 in SpA patients, as well as HCW, was higher than expected based on reported symptoms. Targeted anti-cytokine therapy could act as a protective factor for a severe disease course in SpA patients. However, in this population, IgG and IgM titres did not change in a clinically significant manner at 3 months, and patient did not seem to develop an immune profile consistent with durable response. This result could be due to a weaker immune response in mild infections, but further studies are w rranted to clarify the pathophysiology beyond these observations.","Ortolan, A.; Cosma, C.; Lorenzin, M.; Cozzi, G.; Doria, A.; Plebani, M.; Ramonda, R.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.2681,585

163710,Introduction: The Time Elapsed,2021,"Background: Given the impact of COVID-19 on Indigenous and ethnic minority populations observed globally, keeping COVID-19 out of vulnerable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous Australian) communities remains a priority. Compared to non-Indigenous Australians, Indigenous Australians experience disparities in cancer incidence and outcomes due to social disadvantage, increased cancer-related modifiable risk factors, poorer access to health services and lower participation in screening. During the pandemic, cancer-related investigations and treatment reduced significantly in Australia, leading to potential decreases in cancer diagnoses and consequences for future survival outcomes. Concerned about the risk of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 for Indigenous Australians, as well as worsening cancer outcomes, Cancer Australia undertook strategic health promotion initiatives, to inform and support optimal cancer care. Methods: In consultation with respected Indigenous colleagues to ensure cultural appropriateness of language and information, we published a dedicated webpage titled 'Cancer and COVID-19 - what it means for our Mob∗' with tailored information, advice, and links to key resources and support services for Indigenous Australians. We also released a video titled 'Act early for our Mob's Health', providing targeted, culturally appropriate, consumer-friendly information to encourage Indigenous Australians to see their doctor or Aboriginal Health Worker with symptoms that may be due to cancer. Results: The information hub has been well-received among the Indigenous Australian community, receiving over 3,200 visits, and the social media campaigns have received over 1.4 million impressions and 46,000 video views between mid-March 2020 to mid-February 2021. This campaign has supported proactivity among the Indigenous population in keeping their communities safe during the pandemic, maintaining a population rate of COVID-19 of less than one percent of all confirmed cases in Australia. Conclusions:Culturally appropriate information and resources developed through the process of co-design can help to influence positive health behaviour change in Indigenous populations. We predict that our strategic, multichannel health promotion campaign is contributing to keeping the Indigenous Australian community safe and informed during the pandemic, with additional work needed to monitor cancer rates and outcomes and address the ongoing information needs of the community. ∗Mob is a colloquial term to identify a group of Indigenous Australians associated with a family or community from a certain place.","Der Vartanian, C.; Milch, V.; Garvey, G.; Anderiesz, C.; Salisbury, J.; Woods, C.

163836,The LPGA’s global tour and domestic audience_ factors influencing viewer’s intention to watch in the United States,2020,"Abstract Component failure analysis is sometimes difficult to directly detect due to the complexity of an operating system configuration. Raw time series data is not enough in some cases to understand the type of fault or how it is progressing. The conversion of data from the time domain to the frequency domain assists researchers in making a more discernible difference for detecting failures, but depending on the manufacturing equipment type and complexity, there is still a possibility for inaccurate results. This research explores a method of classifying rolling bearing faults utilizing the total energy gathered from the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Using a spectrogram over an entire process cycle, the PSD is swept through time and the total energy is computed and plotted over the periodic machine cycle. Comparing with a baseline set of data, classification patterns emerge, giving an indication of the type of fault, when a fault begins and how the fault progresses. There is a separable difference in each type of fault and a measurable change in the distribution of accumulated damage over time. A roller bearing is used as a validating component, due to the known types of faults and their classifications. Traditional methods are used for comparison and the method verified using experimental and industrial applications. Future application is justified for more complex and not so well-understood systems.","Wescoat, Ethan; Mears, Laine; Goodnough, Josh; Sims, John",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315894; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315894,585

164003,Risk communication in the fight against COVID-19 in Brazil: A rhetorical analysis/ Comunicação de risco no enfrentamento da COVID-19 no Brasil: uma análise retórica,2021,"Currently, for the recognition of an individual as a tax resident of the Russian Federation, only the period of his stay in the country during the previous 12 months is taken into account. But in 2019, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced the need to change this approach as one of the areas of tax policy for 2020–2022. The main ways to improve legal regulation are the reduction of the actual period of stay on the territory of Russia from 183 to 90 days per year and the introduction of additional more flexible criteria characterizing the relationship of a person with the state. The aim of the study is a comprehensive assessment of the approach to the definition of the individuals` residence in the Russian financial law, which allows to make a conclusion about the feasibility and prospects for its reform. The article examines various aspects of the current legal regulation in this area, as well as the features of recognition of individuals as tax residents in accordance with the international agreement on the avoidance of double taxation have been investigated. The advantages of the existing approach can be attributed to its simplicity and certainty, which is associated with the use of only one objective criterion – the period of stay in the country. In such conditions, it is not difficult for tax agents and tax authorities to classify taxpayers as tax residents. This greatly simplifies administration and allows citizens themselves to better understand their status and associated rights and responsibilities. Paradoxically, this feature is also the lack of regulation. Since, in fact, it completely gives tax residency to the power of the citizens themselves, primarily the wealthy. The simplicity of its definition makes it possible to practically freely change the Russian tax jurisdiction to another, depending on personal benefit. As a result, the state is unable to levy taxes on the income of persons who de facto have close personal and economic ties with the Russian jurisdiction, but de jure do not meet the formal characteristics of a tax resident, planning in advance the period of their stay in Russia. The simplicity in establishing the tax residency of the Russian Federation allows taxpayers to practically freely change the Russian tax jurisdiction to another, depending on personal gain. As a result, the state is unable to levy taxes on the income of persons who de facto have close personal and economic ties with the Russian jurisdiction, but de jure do not meet the formal characteristics of a tax resident, planning in advance the period of their stay in Russia. The article analyzes the main approaches to determining the residence of individuals used in world practice, as well as the measures taken by various states to avoid abuse of the right by individuals. Particular attention is paid to the study of tax residence as a key condition for the implementation of the international agreement on the exchange of information on financial accounts (CRS MCAA), since unfair manipulation of tax status can also impede the state financial control. It is also interesting to study the issue of determining the residence of individuals in the context of the COVID‑19 virus pandemic, since the cancellation of transport links between countries for a long period of time may be forced to change the tax status of many people. As a result of the research, the author came to the conclusion that the approach to determining the tax residence of individuals in Russia differs from that used in most developed countries and needs some resemblance with global practice. In particular, the introduction of the concept of a center of vital interests into Russian legislation will allow considering the connection of a person with Russian jurisdiction on an individual basis, excluding the possibility of abuse. © 2021, Russian Academy of Sciences.

The algorithm is inspired by the kinetic partitioning mechanism, by which molecules follow alternative folding pathways to their native structure, some much faster than others. Similarly, our algorithm RAFFT generates an ensemble of concurrent folding pathways ending in multiple metastable structures for each given sequence; this is in contrast with traditional thermodynamic approaches, which are based on aim to find single structures with minimal free energies. When analyzing 50 predicted folds per sequence, we found near-native predictions (79% PPV and 81% sensitivity) for RNAs of length ≤ 200 nucleotides, matching the performance of recent deep-learningbased structure prediction methods. Our algorithm also acts as a folding kinetic ansatz, which we tested on two RNAs: the coronavirus frameshifting stimulation element (CFSE) and a classic bi-stable sequence. For the CFSE, an ensemble of 68 distinct structures computed by RAFFT allowed us to produce complete folding kinetic trajectories, whereas known methods require evaluating millions of sub-optimal structures to achieve this result. For the second application, only 46 distinct structures were required to reproduce the kinetics, whereas known methods required a sample of 20,000 structures. Thanks to the efficiency of the fast Fourier transform on which RAFFT is based, these computations are efficient, with complexity .","Opuu, Vaitea; Merleau, Nono S.

This is especially true for SMEs that lack the expertise, awareness, and ability to dedicate specific resources to disaster planning and management. SMEs are quick to explore social media for functions such as customer acquisition, perhaps due to greater flexibility and agility than large companies. However, SMEs are constrained by a lack of resources, limiting the extent to which they can exploit social media. We collect data from 68 SMEs and analyze the extent to which they explore and exploit social media tools. Our findings suggest that the firms fail to exploit their social media presence to leverage long-term strategic benefits, which would be helpful during a disaster. Our contribution includes ways to analyze social media exploration and exploitation and suggestions to strategically manage social media use for business continuity.","Goel, Lakshmi Donaldson Janice",Journal of Global Information Management,https://doi.org/10.4018/jgim.20211101.oa8,585

In order to evaluate the feasibility of training nuclear segmentation models on small, custom annotated image datasets that have been augmented, we have designed a computational pipeline to systematically compare different nuclear segmentation model architectures and model training strategies. Using this approach, we demonstrate that transfer learning and tuning of training parameters, such as the composition, size and pre-processing of the training image dataset, can lead to robust nuclear segmentation models, which match, and often exceed, the performance of existing, off-the-shelf deep learning models pre-trained on large image datasets. We envision a practical scenario where deep learning nuclear segmentation models trained in this way can be shared across a laboratory, facility, or institution, and continuously improved by training them on progressively larger and varied image datasets. Our work provides computational tools and a practical framework for deep learning-based biological image segmentation using small annotated image datasets.","Zaki, George; Gudla, Prabhakar R.; Lee, Kyunghun; Kim, Justin; Ozbun, Laurent; Shachar, Sigal; Gadkari, Manasi; Sun, Jing; Fraser, Iain D.C.; Franco, Luis M.; Misteli, Tom; Pegoraro, Gianluca",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.041020,585

Different formal and informal Course Management Systems (CMSs) were incorporated to aid in this sudden transition to virtual classroom mode. A significant challenge that emerged in the Global South during this emergency transition was the glaring presence of Digital Divide. In this paper, we explore this situation for Bangladesh through a case study of three courses where emergency remote teaching was adopted from March to June 2020. The students enrolled were surveyed using questionnaire and the collected data was analyzed to determine the potency of Facebook Social Learning groups in Emergency Remote Teaching. Even as the emergency remote teaching phase ends in many communities, the pandemic and its effects continue and institutions worldwide are preparing themselves for long-term fully online classroom settings. It is thus essential to wisely choose a platform and pedagogical system for online teaching, which can minimize the discriminating effects of the digital divide among students. With that motivation, we present our work exploring the efficacy of Facehook's Social Learning Group as an inexpensive alternative to high-bandwidth consuming and costly CMSs.","Amir, S.; Kamal, M.

While these corpora are valuable in supporting analysis for this specific pandemic, researchers will benefit from additional benchmark corpora that contain other epidemics for better generalizability and to facilitate cross-epidemic pattern recognition and trend analysis tasks. During our research, we discover little disease related corpora in the literature that are sizable and rich enough to support such cross-epidemic analysis tasks. To address this issue, we present EPIC30M, a large-scale epidemic corpus that contains more than 30 million micro-blog posts, i.e., tweets crawled from Twitter, from year 2006 to 2020. EPIC30M contains a subset of 26.2 million tweets related to three general diseases, namely Ebola, Cholera and Swine Flu, and another subset of 4.7 million tweets of six global epidemic outbreaks, including the 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu, 2010 Haiti Cholera, 2012 Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), 2013 West African Ebola, 2016 Yemen Cholera and 2018 Kivu Ebola. Furthermore, we explore and discuss the properties of this corpus with statistics of key terms and hashtags and trends analysis for each subset. Finally, we discuss the potential value and impact that EPIC30M could generate through a discussion of multiple use cases of cross-epidemic research topics that attract growing interest in recent years.

If the pets were acquired by adoption, we asked participants from what sources they adopted them. Finally, it was examined which characteristics of the owner and his/her household influenced the adoption of pets. A total of 566 owners who acquired pets in 2019 and 2020 participated in the research. The COVID pandemic has reduced the number of pet owners 2.67 times in 2020 compared to 2019. Dogs were the most favourite pets acquired before (43%) and during (42%) the pandemic. During the pandemic, 61% of pets were acquired by adoption. The probability that a pet will be adopted was higher compared to the other manners of acquisition in 2020 and compared to the methods of acquisition in 2019 (χ2 = 9.59;DF = 2;P &lt; 0.01). During the pandemic in 2020, the share of dogs, cats and non-traditional pets adopted directly from previous owners increased by 32%, 13% and 12%, respectively.

This paper discusses about the examination of conversation network of Twitter hashtag related to Covid-19 in Indonesia by using a network perspective. During this pandemic situation, Twitter has been increasingly adopted as a medium of conversational interaction amongst people to express their opinion and feeling about the situation, or share information, among others. At the same time, the Indonesian Government has established an official hashtag (#) to coordinate and organize conversations related to a specific topic of Covid-19, namely #BersatuLawanCovid19. In this way, the Government would be able to reach the public interest due to the capability of the hashtag to become a trending topic. This study examines how the Twitter conversations emerged and developed within the Twitter community by using Social Network Analysis approach. We have collected 793 Twitter users and 4441 Twitter chats from the hashtag #BersatuLawanCovid19. We then visualized the relationship network and examined the community using Social Network Analysis metrics with NodeXL. This study found that there is no a mutual engagement amongst the community members in terms of conversational practices. Interestingly, although some members of the community received a high number of engagement efforts from others, they do not actively respond to the initiatives. This suggests that the official account of government who is in-charge of managing the conversation need to enhance their communication strategy to improve the conversation within the community.","Wijaya, S.

Four groups of teachers were identified by using Latent Profile Analysis: 1) teachers with mediocre stress and work engagement (34.4%);2) teachers with mediocre stress and lowest work engagement (11.5%);3) teachers with highest stress and work engagement (26.5%);and 4) teachers with lowest stress and highest work engagement (27.6%). The findings indicated that teachers’ occupational well-being was individually constructed, and there was a diversity with ways how negative and positive aspects of occupational well-being were drawn into patterns. The profile groups were further analyzed with respect to teachers’ experiences of emotional exhaustion, recovery from work, and interactional styles of teaching. The results revealed that during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic many teachers experienced occupational stress as well as some increase in stress due to the pandemic. In addition, the findings provided new insights concerning how teachers’ work engagement was perhaps not severely affected during the first few months of the pandemic, and on how different teaching styles were associated specifically with different aspects of occupational well-being. © Copyright © 2021 Pöysä, Pakarinen and Lerkkanen.","Pöysä, S.; Pakarinen, E.; Lerkkanen, M.

As an ethnic minority, the Roma are overrepresented in marginalised and impoverished settlements and, given the basic recommendations to contain the pandemic - wash hands, keep the distance and work from home, their situation was disproportionately exacerbated by the imposition of lockdown measures. We use secondary data to interpret the deprivation features that puts them at greater epidemic risk. In addition, the Covid-19 crisis led to a sudden return of the Romanian Roma living in Western Europe. The slums and ghettos were more strictly quarantined than regular areas, suggesting a form of negative quarantine. Quarantine was - next to its medical purpose - used as a rhetoric and disciplinary device. Roma were portrayed as infection spreaders, and racism was channelled mainly through the media. While the spread of the disease placed them at risk, the lockdown itself induced major survival challenges. By using media and social media analysis, we show how the discourse of negative quarantine unfolded. The latter was diluted in the general relaxation of containment measures, but its legacy as a practice raises questions for the future governance of areas inhabited by the Roma.","Berescu, C.; Alexandrescu, F.; Anghel, I.

Especially, the global social structure pattern was changed. At the same time, traditional Eastern culture attaches great importance to table etiquette and eating together around the table. With the transformation of social lifestyle and structure, more and more people must start to face the situation of being alone or the mentality of dining alone in a restaurant. This research uses the theory of cultural probes to study the post-COVID-19 period, during which consumers stay alone in the restaurant and generate daily context and behavior patterns. Its research method adopts the role of “first-person perspective”, combined with the context of “modeling feature track”. Based on the cultural probe toolkit, this research obtains information for integrated research and simulation test verification. In the experimental testing phase, participants designed the user experience for the product’s real-time “design interactive mode” and “personal space experience” through interviews, taking photos for record and writing mood logs, and created a new interactive design framework. The theme of this research is “The Interactive Mode and User Experience of Alone Dining Space during the Post-Covid-19 Period from the Perspective of Cultural Probes”. It conducts research and draws conclusions based on the cultural probe theory and provides an innovative model that focuses on the interactive design relationship between people and products, supplemented by product appearance molding design.

This survey-based study reports on changes in general pedestrian behaviours due to pandemic conditions such as reduction in frequency of daily walking, and lack of comfort when in proximity of others. Responses to common urban pedestrian scenarios identified emerging adaptive strategies used by adults to maintain physical distancing. The two main strategies are Avoidance (stepping off one’s path, crossing the road) and Encounter (stopping to let others pass, continuing the path of travel). Decisions to use one physical distancing strategy over another are related to the perceived traffic safety risks associated with the scenarios. For the low- and moderate-risk traffic scenarios, stepping off the path to avoid others is the preferred strategy. In the high-risk traffic scenarios, stopping on the path to let others pass or continuing to walk are preferred to stepping into traffic, even though physical distancing will not be maintained. Results from the study have implications for educational campaigns to promote effective physical distancing strategies, as well as planning for urban infrastructure to promote walking for health and mobility. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Greenslade, G.

For instance, brief exposure to static images depicting other people gazing at objects made subjects slower at detecting subsequent motion in the direction of gaze, suggesting that looking at someone else’s gaze caused a directional motion adaptation. Here we confirm, using a more stringent method, that viewing static images of another person gazing in a particular direction, at an object, produced motion aftereffects in the opposite direction. The aftereffect was manifested as a change in perceptual decision threshold for detecting left versus right motion. The effect disappeared when the person was looking away from the object. These findings suggest that the attentive gaze of others is encoded as an implied agent-to-object motion that is sufficiently robust to cause genuine motion aftereffects, though subtle enough to remain subthreshold.","Randall, William; Guterstam, Arvid",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.08.373308,585

In this paper, we present our protocol for a scoping review to identify performance indicators for obstetric safety. We aim to identify a comprehensive list of obstetric safety indicators which may help reduce the number of preventable patient harms, to summarize the data and to synthesize the results. Methods and analysis: We will use the methodological framework described by Arksey and O Malley and further expanded by Levac. We will search multiple electronic databases such as Medline, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library as well as websites from professional bodies and other organisations, using an iterative search strategy. We will include indicators that relate to preventable harms in the process of obstetric care. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts of search results to determine eligibility for inclusion. For records where eligibility is not clear, the reviewers will screen the full text version. If reviewers decisions regarding eligibility differ, a third reviewer will review the full text record. Two reviewers will independently extract data from records that meet our inclusion criteria using a standardized data collection form. We will narratively describe quantitative data, such as the frequency with which indicators are identified, and conduct a thematic analysis of the qualitative data. We will compile a comprehensive list of patient safety indicators identified during our scoping review and organise them according to concepts that best suit the data such as the Donabedian model or the Hospital Harm Framework. We will discuss the implications of the indicators for future research, clinical practice and policy making. We will report the conduct of the review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA ScR) Checklist.

As life expectancy increases, older adults prefer to remain independent at home. Smart Home systems and Assistive Technologies have been developed to enable older adults to live in their own homes as they age, enhancing safety, independence and quality of life. Although considerable Smart Home mobile applications exist focused on older adult’s wellbeing, they still face considerable challenges in usability, feasibility and accessibility regarding design of interfaces. There is a gap in recent research on evaluation of User Interface (UI) designed or adapted to address older adults needs and abilities. The paper takes part of an ongoing project evaluation stage, for a smart home and health monitoring system, applied in two stages: (i) heuristic evaluation and (ii) remote user testing. The main objective of the paper is to focus on the second evaluation stage, that took place with end users, applying unmoderated remote usability testing, due to Covid-19 pandemic. According to the System Usability Scale (SUS) and Net Promoter Score (NPS) techniques it could be able to quantify the users experience and measure the level of satisfaction related to the smart home and health monitoring system. The SUS results identified that the system’s usability was considered acceptable with a final score of 65,6. It was concluded that the unmoderated test with a SUS post-questionnaire can be a complex method to apply with older adults. The SUS questionnaire could lead to mistakes and misinterpretation, some contradictory results could be related to this complexity among older adults, and this could lead to a major impact on overall SUS scores. In addition, the NPS metric was identified as not the appropriate to measure user satisfaction with a small sample of users as SUS technique. It is concluded that findings should be supported by applying individual moderated tests with more end users to provide insights to designers and developers to create more usable interfaces to address the needs and abilities of the older adults. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","da Silva, A.

All the members of the Israeli Society of Rheumatology were encouraged to participate and repeatedly reminded to report any new cases. Rheumatology centers from 11 hospitals from the Northern and Central part of Israel participated in this study. The registry included demographic data, AIIRD diagnosis and duration, systemic organ involvement, co-morbidities, treatment (conventional synthetic disease modifying drugs (csDMARDs), biologic/targeted (b/ts) DMARDs, corticosteroids use, dose and treatment duration, date of COVID19 diagnosis, severity of the viral disease and complications, duration of hospitalization, if required, treatment for COVID 19, laboratory results and outcome. The diagnosis of COVID 19 was made by a positive SARS CoV2 PCR. The indications for SARS CoV2 PCR testing in Israel comprise clinical symptoms or exposure to a confirmed close contact. Severe illness was defined by SpO2 <94% in room air, respiratory rate of ≥30 breaths/min, PaO2/FiO2 <300 mm Hg, or lung infiltrates ≥50% on chest imaging. The epidemiological data regarding the number of COVID19 confirmed patients, the number of severe cases and the rate of mortality among the general population per day and per week, were extracted from the data dashboard of the Israeli Ministry of Health. We analyzed data from 02.2020 to 15.01.2021. Results: During the study period we experienced 3 waves of COVID 19 pandemic. The governmental management of COVID19 spread, at the beginning of the pandemic, included inforcement of severe travel restrictions and social distancing, followed eventually by a preventive lockdown, in spite of the relatively low number of cases. Easing of the restrictions, lifting the travel ban, opening of the commerce and schools led to 2 much more severe waves, which triggered 2 new lockdowns. Up to January 2021, 549763 Israelis had confirmed COVID19, 30% of whom had severe disease, 0.84% died (30% of the patients with severe disease). We identified 190 AIIRD patients (mean(SD) age 52(18), 30% males) who had confirmed COVID19. The weekly incidence curve of patients with rheumatic diseases correlated with the curve of the general population (Figure 1). Sixty-one % of the patients with AIIRD received csDMARDs, 41% were on b/ tsDMARDs, 39% on chronic corticosteroids, 12% on ≥10mg prednisone. Forty-seven% of patients required hospitalization, 20% had severe COVID19. Sixteen patients (42% of patients with severe COVID19) (mean(SD), median age 64.7(15.4),67)) died (systemic sclerosis-4 patients, rheumatoid arthritis -6, systemic lupus erythematosus -2, antiphospholipid syndrome-2, granulomatous polyangiitis -1, polymyalgia rheumatica-1). The AIIRD was active in 56% of them, 50% received csDMARDs, none of them were on b/tsDMARDs, 31% received chronic prednisone≥10 mg. All patients who died had at least 2 comorbidities. Conclusion: The pattern of spread of COVID19 in AIIRD patients is similar to the general population despite repeated mass media alerts for enhanced social distancing for elderly and immune suppressed patients. The disease tends to be more severe with enhanced mortality, especially in those with active AIIRD disease and organ involvement (lungs, heart, renal), older age and co-morbidities. A reporting bias cannot be excluded.","Kharouf, F.; Eviatar, T.; Braun, M.; Pokroy-Shapira, E.; Brodavka, M.; Agmon-Levin, N.; Toledano, K.; Oren, S.; Lidar, M.; Tavor, Y.; Amit Vazina, M.; Sabbah, F.; Breuer, G.; Dagan, A.; Zisman, D.; Markovits, D.; Reitblat, T.; Giryes, S.; Mevorach, D.; Paran, D.; Elkayam, O.; Balbir-Gurman, A.; Braun-Moscovici, Y.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.2581,585
169783,COVID-19 and Brazilian handball coaches: impacts on training prescription and professional learning,2020,"Antibody production following vaccination can provide protective immunity to subsequent infection from pathogens such as influenza. However, circumstances where antibody formation is impaired after vaccination, such as in older people, require us to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underpin successful vaccination in order to improve vaccine design for at risk groups. Here, by studying the breadth of anti-hemagglutinin (HA) IgG, serum cytokines, and B and T cell responses by flow cytometry before and after influenza vaccination, we show that formation of circulating T follicular helper cells (cTfh) cells are the best predictor of high titre antibody responses. Using MHC class II tetramers we demonstrate that HA-specific cTfh cells can derived from pre-existing memory CD4+ T cells and have a diverse TCR repertoire. In older people, the differentiation of HA-specific cells into cTfh cells was impaired. This age-dependent defect in cTfh cell formation was not due to a contraction of the TCR repertoire, but rather was linked with an increased inflammatory gene signature in cTfh cells. Together this suggests that strategies that temporarily dampen inflammation at the time of vaccination may be a viable strategy to boost optimal antibody generation upon immunisation of older people.","Hill, D.

Exposure to CS teargas is known to have consequences on protesters health (i.e. eye, skin irritation, respiratory problems), but recent concerns have been raised over its potential gender-specific effects. Indeed, field and clinical observations report cases of menstrual cycle issues among female protesters following high exposure to teargas. The hypothesis of a link between teargas exposure and menstrual cycle issues is plausible from a physiological standpoint, but has not yet been empirically investigated. Using data from a cross-sectional study on Yellow Vests protesters health in France, we examined the relationship between exposure to teargas and menstrual cycle issues among female protesters (n = 145). Analyses suggested a positive link between exposure and menstrual cycle perturbations. These results constitute first and preliminary evidence that CS teargas may be linked with menstrual cycle among women, which need corroboration given the importance of this issue. We call for further research on the potential effects of CS teargas on womens reproductive system.","Mahfud, Y.; Samuel, A.; Celebi, E.; Adam-Troian, J.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210955v1?rss=1,585

Design / Methodology / Approach: This study was carried out with relevant indicators of the oil and gas industry (downstream). Commercialization data (from 2017 to 2020) were compared in order to verify the pandemic impacts. After collecting the data, we used the Momentum approach to prospect the scenarios, suggesting a strategic action plan for each prospection. Results: The results reveal that, regardless the post-pandemic scenario that we will encounter, the industries belonging to the oil and gas sector will have to define strategies and implement solid action plans to remain competitive in the market. It was also possible to note that the action plan for the desirable and trend scenario has synergy. Limitations of the investigation: The results obtained in this research refer only to the Brazilian scenario, more specifically to the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry and may differ from other sectors or regions. Practical implications: This research provides ways for oil and gas companies to be prepared for the post-pandemic future, thus remaining competitive in the market. In addition, as a result of applying the Momentum method, it is possible to see how the sector's indicators relate to each other through the cross-impact matrix. Originality / Value: This is an unprecedented study that allows the downstream oil and gas companies to be better prepared to the post-COVID-19 scenario. It adds value not only to the oil and gas industry but also to other industries, since it is possible to replicate the method presented here in other contexts with different databases. © 2021, Associacao Brasileira de Engenharia de Producao.

Methods: A total of 81 Romanian parents (90% mothers, Mage = 39.3, SDage = 8.50) of children with DD participated in this cross-sectional study. Information regarding changes in lifestyle, health conditions, and psychosocial reactions of their children during the lockdown as well as measures adopted for compliance to preventive strategies and in dealing with emotions, was gathered. Results: The results of the study revealed that most of the children had restricted access to leisure activities, family doctor consultations, were less active physically, got fewer opportunities to socialise with their peers, had restricted access to rehabilitation therapies, and specialised medical services. Compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures is challenging for children with DD. Results also provided evidence of parents' emotional distress and negative changes in the lives of children with DD, the inability to adopt COVID-19 appropriate behaviour, and negative emotional states experienced by their parents. Conclusions and recommendations:The results highlight the need for authorities and specialists to plan and implement appropriate intervention procedures, to address the outlined issues, to meet the challenges brought forth by the ongoing crisis. © 2021 Birlesik Dunya Yenilik Arastirma ve Yayincilik Merkezi.

We therefore aimed to compare key health and economic outcomes of NZ relative to OECD countries as of mid-June 2021. Methods: This analysis compared health outcomes (cumulative death rates from COVID-19 and excess death rates) and economic measures (quarterly GDP and unemployment levels) across OECD countries. Results: NZ had the lowest cumulative COVID-19 death rate in the OECD at 242 times lower than the 38-OECD-country average: 5.2 vs 1256 per million population. When considering excess deaths, NZ had the largest negative value in the OECD, equivalent to around 2000 fewer deaths than expected. When considering the average GDP change over the five quarters of 2020 to 2021-Q1, NZ was the sixth best performer (at 0.5% vs -0.3% for the OECD average). The increase in unemployment in NZ was also less than the OECD average (1.1 percentage points to a peak of 5.2%, vs 3.3 points to 8.6%, respectively). Conclusions: New Zealand's elimination strategy response to COVID-19 produced the best mortality protection outcomes in the OECD. In economic terms it also performed better than the OECD average in terms of adverse impacts on GDP and employment. Nevertheless, a fuller accounting of the benefits and costs needs to be done once the population is vaccinated and longer-term health and economic outcomes are considered.","Wilson, N.; Grout, L.; Summers, J.

171038,Challenges of the Covid-19 regarding insurance,2021,"Every poem has a creation talanoa: a story of how it was written. In a Rotuman context, ‘talanoa’ or story, can either be a ‘rogrog/o’ or ‘hanuju’. From conception to final drafting, the creation hanuju can reveal the often-volatile relationship between a poet’s internal self-talk and external historical and contemporary experiences. Memories (shaped by external experiences) will feed mulling, reliving, and reimagination (internal self-talk) and can consequently and impulsively set off the content, tone, form, and literary techniques of a poem into unanticipated directions. It is not uncommon for a poet to step away from a stanza and reflexively ask, ‘How did I get here?!’ Other external factors of poetic crafting are the social and political climate of the time of writing, the purpose and specifications of a commissioned task, and research. Research is necessary if a poem insists on wandering into ragged and unfamiliar territory. Of all these factors, current socio-political climate is perhaps the most influential in mobilising communities and individuals to engage in creative thinking and writing. This article is a one-way (because as a reader, you are not in the position to interrupt me) hanuju of my creative process of writing the poem Writing each other during COVID-19 and the concurrent event(s) of the BLM movement. This hanuju critically discusses the themes of remember-ing obedience, mov-ing over in honour of disobedience, and conced-ing power that emerged as a vison for unity and kotahitanga. In essence, this hanuju is largely a story of disobedience: a celebration of my mapiga (grandmother) Lilly’s gift of Rotuman language storytelling and the centring of the Rotuman language in a poem written for a predominantly mixed audience in the Waikato region of Aotearoa. © 2021, Wilf Malcolm Institute of Educational Research.

171096,"Discovery of highly potent pancoronavirus fusion inhibitors that also effectively inhibit COVID-19 variants from the UK (Alpha), South Africa (Beta), and India (Delta)",2021-09-17,"Background. The mechanism of the immune response in patients with COVID-19 is still poorly understood and differs from other respiratory infections. Immunodeficiencies and age-related characteristics of immunity can be regarded as factors influencing reinfection and a predisposition to prolonged persistence of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the studies report about post-infection immunity to SARS-CoV-2 for adults and less for children. However, understanding the dynamics of antibody production to SARS-CoV-2 among children as well as other unique features of immune response is extremely important, because this provides to avoid possible complications and long-term outcomes of COVID-19, and predict the epidemic spread of the new coronavirus in the organized groups of children such as kindergartens, schools, study groups and clubs. Aim: to evaluate the humoral and cellular immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. Materials and methods. We reported data of the first phase prospective cohort study of immunity among 60 children living in Irkutsk, Russia within a month after SARS-CoV-2 infection, which took place in October and November 2020. Results. Immunity of children one month after SARS-Cov-2 infection was characterized by suppressed cell-mediated and humoral immunity, and phagocytosis dysfunction. Reduced phagocytosis by neutrophils was noted for 61.6 % of individuals. Conclusions. Children after COVID-19 had impaired immunity to SARS-CoV-2, which may be a predictor of chronic infection and other long-term outcomes of COVID-19. © 2021 Sovero Press Publishing House.

171260,Cross-Cultural Perspectives on the Role of Empathy during COVID-19’s First Wave,2021,"Background Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous characteristics. A simulation study demonstrated that attempts to categorize patients with a complex disease into more homogeneous subgroups could have more power to elucidate hidden heritability. Methods We conducted cluster analyses using the k-means algorithm with a cluster number of 15 based on phenotypic variables from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). As a preliminary study, we conducted a conventional genome-wide association study (GWAS) with a dataset of 597 ASD cases and 370 controls. In the second step, we divided cases based on the clustering results and conducted GWAS in each of the subgroups vs controls (cluster-based GWAS). We also conducted cluster-based GWAS on another SSC dataset of 712 probands and 354 controls in the replication stage. Results In the preliminary study, we observed no significant associations. In the second step of cluster-based GWASs, we identified 65 chromosomal loci, which included 30 intragenic loci located in 21 genes and 35 intergenic loci that satisfied the threshold of P<5.0×10−8. Some of these loci were located within or near previously reported candidate genes for ASD: CDH5, CNTN5, CNTNAP5, DNAH17, DPP10, DSCAM, FOXK1, GABBR2, GRIN2A5, ITPR1, NTM, SDK1, SNCA and SRRM4. Of these 65 significant chromosomal loci, rs11064685 located within the SRRM4 gene had a significantly different distribution in the cases vs. controls in the replication cohort. Conclusions These findings suggest that clustering may successfully identify subgroups with relatively homogeneous disease etiologies. Further cluster validation and replication studies are warranted in larger cohorts.","Narita, Akira; Nagai, Masato; Mizuno, Satoshi; Ogishima, Soichi; Tamiya, Gen; Ueki, Masao; Sakurai, Rieko; Makino, Satoshi; Obara, Taku; Ishikuro, Mami; Yamanaka, Chizuru; Matsubara, Hiroko; Kuniyoshi, Yasutaka; Murakami, Keiko; Ueno, Fumihiko; Noda, Aoi; Kobayashi, Tomoko; Kobayashi, Mika; Usuzaki, Takuma; Ohseto, Hisashi; Hozawa, Atsushi; Kikuya, Masahiro; Metoki, Hirohito; Kure, Shigeo; Kuriyama, Shinichi",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/614958,585
171400,Home mechanical ventilation practices in Spain and Portugal,2021,"Background: Disparities in clinical trial participation can mean disparities in medical advances, and disproportionate participation is an ethical issue even if differential results are not expected. The disparate impact of Covid-19 highlighted the importance of representativeness in trials aiming to prevent or treat disease. Previous analyses suggest there are likely significant differences in cancer clinical trial participants by race, ethnicity, and age. However, these analyses generally compare trial demographics to broad population demographics. Methods: This analysis used the SEER-Medicare linked database with claims data from 2014-2016 to compare lung cancer clinical trial participants to similar lung cancer patients not participating in a treatment trial. We compared the race, ethnicity, sex, age, and number of comorbidities for Medicare beneficiaries with at least one claim for an active treatment for lung cancer to the demographics of Medicare beneficiaries with at least one claim coded with the National Clinical Trials (NCT) number for an active treatment trial in lung cancer. The relationship between clinical trial participation and demographic variables was assessed using chisquare tests for binary variables and t-tests for continuous variables and corrected for multiplicity. A logistic regression model was used to assess robustness of these findings. Clinical trial participants were hypothesized to be more likely to be White, non-Hispanic, and male, and have a lower mean age and fewer comorbidities than the comparable non-trial active treatment population. Results: We compared 1,624 lung cancer clinical trial patients to 34,077 active treatment lung cancer patients. Clinical trial participants were more likely than non-trial active treatment patients to be female (53.6% vs. 50.4%, p = 0.015) or Asian/Pacific Islander (13.0% vs. 5.2%, p < 0.001) and less likely to be Black (5.2% vs. 9.0%, p < 0.001) or White (76.5% vs. 81.4%, p < 0.001). Trial participants had a lower mean age (70.7 vs. 73.7, p < 0.001) and fewer comorbidities (3.0 vs. 4.6, p < 0.001). There was not a significant difference by Hispanic ethnicity (5.2% vs. 4.4%, p = 0.106). The regression analyses supported these findings. Conclusions: Most analyses of clinical trials enrollment do not have a direct comparison group. Because this study is directly comparing lung cancer trial participants and non-participants from the same Medicare beneficiary population, the results fill a gap in our understanding of disparities in cancer clinical trial participation. Trial participants in this analysis were more representative than hypothesized, although the results supported previous findings that Black patients and older patients are underrepresented in cancer trials. There was also lower participation by White patients. Underrepresentation of patients with comorbidities may be due to trial eligibility criteria.","Mishkin, G.

Students are even more demanding, and professors need to follow the evolution of technology and try to increase student engagement in the classrooms (presential or virtual). Higher education students recognise that the introduction of new tools and learning methods can improve the teaching quality and increase the motivation to learn. Regarding a question about which type of classes students preferred, ninety-one point ninety-nine per cent (91.99%) of the students wanted interactive classes over traditional. Having this concern in mind over the past years, a professor explored a set of methods, strategies and tools and designed a new and innovative paradigm using gamification. This approach is denominated TechTeach and explores a set of trending concepts and interactive tools to teach computer science subjects. It was designed to run in a B-learning environment. The paradigm uses flipped classrooms, bring your own device (BYOD), gamification, training of soft-skills and quizzes and surveys to increase the student’s engagement and provide the best learning environment to students. Currently, COVID-19 is bringing about new challenges, and TechTeach was improved in order to be more suitable for this new way of teaching (from 0% to 100% online classes). This article details this method and shows how it can be applied in a real environment. A case study was used to prove the functionality and relevance of this approach, and the achieved results are motivating. During the semester, more than a hundred students experienced this new way of teaching and assessment. In the end, more than eighty-one per cent (81%) of the students gave a positive grade to the approach, and more than ninety-five per cent (95.65%) of the students approved the use of the concept of BYOD in the classroom.

172111,Identification of factors impacting on the transmission and mortality of COVID-19,2021,"The aim of the study was to identify the pathomorphology of brain damage in patients who died of COVID-19. Material and methods. Autopsy reports and autopsy brain material of 17 deceased patients with pre-mortem confirmed COVID-19 infection were analyzed. Fatal cases in which COVID-19 was the major cause of death were included in the study. Five people were diagnosed with cerebral infarction. Organ samples were taken for histological examination during autopsy. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and by Nissl to assess brain histopathology. To study the vascular basal membranes the PAS reaction was used, to detect fibrin in vessels phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin (PTAH) staining was used, to determine DNA in nuclei sections were stained according to Feulgen, to detect RNA in neuronal nuclei and cytoplasm sections were stained with methyl green-pyronin. Immunohistochemical study of a neuronal marker, nuclear protein NeuN, was performed to assess neuronal damage. Results. The signs of neuronal damage found in patients who died of COVID-19 included nonspecific changes of nerve cells (acute swelling, retrograde degeneration, karyolysis and cytolysis, ‘ghost' cells, neuronophagia and satellitosis) and signs of circulatory disorders (perivascular and pericellular edema, diapedesis, congested and engorged microvasculature). Conclusion. Brain histopathological data indicate damage to the central nervous system in COVID-19 patients.

Whether or not such a protocol would invalidate the Sacrament requires an investigation of some foundational principles of Sacramental theology, including the use of instruments in the execution of Sacraments, how the form of a Sacrament must be conveyed, and the requisite proximity of the minister to the recipient. A careful analysis of these principles, in light to the suggested protocol, leads to the surprising (although tentative) conclusion that the Sacrament would be valid if executed in this manner.","Newton, William",The Downside Review,https://doi.org/10.1177/00125806211014815,585

There have been many approaches to predict COVID-19 occurrence, including the forecasting approach. However, the traditional forecasting method, particularly machine learning, often does not consider the condition of the data, although it has forms of the count, such as the number of cases. This study employs an autoregression model using Poisson distribution in predicting the COVID-19 future cases, namely the positive and recovery number. We compare the Poisson Autoregression with several well-known forecasting methods, namely ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, BATS, and Prophet. This study found that Poisson Autoregression could create an accurate prediction with MAPE below 20% and tend to follows the actual data for the next 8 to 14 days to the future. Thus, this approach can forecast the future cases of COVID-19 and other cases that use count data in Jakarta, like the number of citizen complaints or transportation context. © 2021 IEEE.","Nasution, B.

172810,Empowering junior leaders during COVID-19: reflections from a team at North Middlesex university hospital,2020,"For flightless arboreal arthropods, moving from the understory into tree canopies is cognitively and energetically challenging because vegetational structures present complex three-dimensional landscapes with substantial gaps. Predation risk and wind-induced perturbations in the canopy may further impede the movement process. In the Australian stick insect Extatosoma tiaratum, first-instar nymphs hatch on the forest floor and disperse toward tree canopies in the daytime. Here, we address such vertical movements and associated sensory cues in E. tiaratum nymphs. Newly hatched nymphs ascend with high endurance, travelling >100 m within 60 minutes. Navigation toward open canopies is underpinned by negative gravitaxis, positive phototaxis, and visual responses to vertically oriented contrast patterns. Nymphal E. tiaratum also use directed jumping to cross air gaps, and respond to tactile stimulation and potential threat with a self-dropping reflex, resulting aerial descent. Post-hatch dispersal in E. tiaratum thus consists of visually mediated displacement both on vegetational structures and in the air; within the latter context, gliding is then an effective mechanism enabling recovery after predator- and perturbation-induced descent. These results further support the importance of a diurnal niche, in addition to the arboreal spatial niche, in the evolution of gliding in wingless arboreal invertebrates. Summary statement To effectively disperse into canopies, ground-hatched stick insects use gravity and visual cues to navigate during midday, jump to cross air gaps and respond to threat or perturbation with self-dropping.","Zeng, Yu; Chang, Sofia W.; Williams, Janelle Y.; Nguyen, Lynn Y-Nhi; Tang, Jia; Naing, Grisanu; Dudley, Robert",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.12.903724,585
172826,The Pandemic across Platform Societies: Weibo and Twitter at the Outbreak of the Covid-19 Epidemic in China and the West,2021,"Critical illness in COVID-19 is caused by inflammatory lung injury, mediated by the host immune system. We and others have shown that host genetic variation influences the development of illness requiring critical care or hospitalisation following SARS-Co-V2 infection. The GenOMICC (Genetics of Mortality in Critical Care) study is designed to compare genetic variants in critically-ill cases with population controls in order to find underlying disease mechanisms. Here, we use whole genome sequencing and statistical fine mapping in 7,491 critically-ill cases compared with 48,400 population controls to discover and replicate 22 independent variants that significantly predispose to life-threatening COVID-19. We identified 15 new independent associations with severe COVID-19, including variants within genes involved in interferon signalling (IL10RB, PLSCR1), leucocyte differentiation (BCL11A), and blood type secretor status (FUT2). Using transcriptome-wide association and colocalisation to infer the effect of gene expression on disease severity, we find evidence implicating expression of multiple genes, including reduced expression of a membrane flippase (ATP11A), and increased mucin expression (MUC1), in severe disease. We show that comparison between critically-ill cases and population controls is highly efficient for genetic association analysis and enables detection of therapeutically-relevant mechanisms of disease. Therapeutic predictions arising from these findings require testing in clinical trials.","Kousathanas, A.; Pairo-Castineira, E.; Rawlik, K.; Stuckey, A.; Odhams, C. A.; Walker, S.; Russell, C.

172941,Clustering Pandemic COVID-19 and Relationship to Temperature and Relative Humidity Among the Tropic and Subtropic Region,2021,"IntroductionThe 2019 coronavirus epidemic (CoViD-19) in Italy originated in Lombardy, on February 21, 2020. Crowding has been defined as a worldwide problem and causes reduced quality of care. It is due and identified by three orders of factors: those at the access (input);those related to the patient’s process (throughput);and those at the exit from the ED (output).ObjectivesWe evaluated all the population who went to ED for mental disorder. Due to the high level of care needed and the simultaneous exposure to risk factors, an excessive duration of ED process can be counterproductive.MethodsWe evaluated all patients accessing our ED for mental disorder from February 22 to May 1, 2020 and during the same period of the previous year.ResultsWe enrolled 345 patients. The Crowding input factors are lower in the pandemic period: reduced attenders (142 vs 203) and reduced average waiting times (40 min vs 54 min). The Crowding throughput factors have instead worsened: LOS (length of stay) for both visit rooms (383 vs 271 min) and holding area (1735 min vs 797 min). The Crowding output factors also worsened: the percentage of access block is higher during the pandemic (100% vs 20%). The Total Access Block Time is significantly higher in the CoViD period for both the visit rooms (3.239 vs 649 min) and the holding area (590 vs 185 min).ConclusionsThe pandemic period presented a worsened crowding for these patients due to the Access Block.","Savioli, G.; Pesenti, S.; Ceresa, I.; Oddone, E.; Bressan, M.

173028,Virtual and remote hands-on undergraduate research in plankton ecology during the 2020 pandemic: Covid-19 can’t stop this!,2021,"The antifungal resistance threat posed by Candida auris necessitates bold and innovative therapeutic options. Farnesol, a quorum-sensing molecule with a potential antifungal and/or adjuvant effect; it may be a promising candidate in alternative treatment regimens. To gain further insights into the farnesol-related effect on C. auris, genome-wide gene expression analysis was performed using RNA-Seq. Farnesol exposure resulted in 1,766 differentially expressed genes. Of these, 447 and 304 genes with at least 1.5-fold increase or decrease in expression, respectively, were selected for further investigation. Genes involved in morphogenesis, biofilm events (maturation and dispersion), gluconeogenesis, iron metabolism, and regulation of RNA biosynthesis showed down-regulation, whereas those related to antioxidative defense, transmembrane transport, glyoxylate cycle, fatty acid β-oxidation, and peroxisome processes were up-regulated. In addition, farnesol treatment increased the expression of certain efflux pump genes, including MDR1, CDR1, and CDR2. Growth, measured by change in CFU number, was significantly inhibited within 2 hours of the addition of farnesol (5.8×107±1.1×107 and 1.1×107±0.3×107 CFU/ml for untreated control and farnesol-exposed cells, respectively) (p<0.001). In addition, farnesol treatment caused a significant reduction in intracellular iron (152.2±21.1 vs. 116.0±10.0 mg/kg), manganese (67.9±5.1 vs. 18.6±1.8 mg/kg), and zinc (787.8±22.2 vs. 245.8±34.4 mg/kg) (p<0.05–0.001) compared to untreated control cells, whereas the level of cooper was significantly increased (274.6±15.7 vs. 828.8±106.4 mg/kg) (p<0.001). Our data demonstrate that farnesol significantly influences the growth, intracellular metal ion contents, and gene expression related to fatty acid metabolism, which could open new directions in developing alternative therapies against C. auris. Importance Candida auris is a dangerous fungal pathogen that causes outbreaks in health care facilities, with infections associated with high mortality rate. As conventional antifungal drugs have limited effects against the majority of clinical isolates, new and innovative therapies are urgently needed. Farnesol is a key regulator molecule of fungal morphogenesis, inducing phenotypic adaptations and influencing biofilm formation as well as virulence. Alongside these physiological modulations, it has a potent antifungal effect alone or in combination with traditional antifungals, especially at supraphysiological concentrations. However, our knowledge about the mechanisms underlying this antifungal effect against C. auris is limited. This study has demonstrated that farnesol enhances the oxidative stress and reduces the fungal survival strategies. Furthermore, it inhibits manganese, zinc transport, and iron metabolism as well as increases fungal intracellular copper content. In addition, metabolism was modulated towards β-oxidation. These results provide definitive explanations for the observed antifungal effects.","Jakab, Ágnes; Balla, Noémi; Ragyák, Ágota; Nagy, Fruzsina; Kovács, Fruzsina; Sajtos, Zsófi; Borman, Andrew M.; Pócsi, István; Baranyai, Edina; Majoros, László; Kovács, Renátó",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.23.457447,585

173206,Breadlines and Banana Bread: Rethinking Our Relationship with Food in the Age of Covid-19,2021,"Purpose or Learning Objective: To outline the response of British radiologists to evolving national guidelines and highlight the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the treatment of musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions. Methods or Background: An online anonymized survey was distributed via the forum of the British Society of Skeletal Radiology (BSSR) in November 2020. Responses were collated using a standardized Google form of 21 questions. Results or Findings: A total of 135 BSSR members completed the survey. About 85% of respondents stopped performing corticosteroid injections (CSIs) during the initial lockdown of the pandemic, primarily influenced by national guidelines. Most respondents initially abstained from offering CSI procedures, and then by November, 68.7% of respondents were providing CSIs for high-and low-risk patients, 23% were only offering CSIs for low-risk patients, with 8% still not performing any CSIs. Approximately 40% of respondents reported routinely obtaining specific written consent regarding the risk of COVID19. An estimated 11,000 CSIs were performed by respondents between March and November 2020 with no reported significant complications related to COVID-19. The number of CSIs performed by BSSR members was reduced to < 80% in > 80% of responses, with an increased backlog of patients awaiting treatment reported by 73%. The average waiting time for routine outpatient CSI treatment was > 12 weeks in 53% of responses. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the clinical practices of MSK radiologists in the United Kingdom. Our survey highlights the rapid response of BSSR members as the national guidelines evolved. Most respondents are currently performing CSIs for MSK conditions when clinically indicated, with patient-enhanced consent. However, the pandemic has resulted in increased waiting times, delaying the treatment of patients who may be experiencing significant pain and disability. Further research is warranted to provide guidance regarding service recovery and offering CSIs around COVID-19 vaccination schedules.","Fairhead, R.; Dalili, D.; Mermekli, A.; Papanikitas, J.; Kuek, D.

The result of this approach is the identification of the CrUPs of the virus itself, which do not appear in the host organism proteome. Thereby, we analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 proteome for identification of CrUPs against the Human Proteome and they are defined as C/H-CrUPs. We found that SARS-CoV-2 include 7.503 C/H-CrUPs, with the SPIKE_SARS2 being the protein with the highest density of C/H-CrUPs. Extensive analysis indicated that the P681R mutation produces new C/H-CrUPs around the R685 cleavage site, while the L452R mutation induces the loss of antigenicity of the NF9 peptide and the strong(er) binding of the virus to ACE2 receptor protein. The simultaneous existence of these mutations in variants like Delta results in the immune escape of the virus, its massive entrance into the host cell, a notable increase in virus formation, and its massive release and thus elevated infectivity.","Pierros, Vasileios; Kontopodis, Evangelos; Stravopodis, Dimitrios J.; Tsangaris, George Th.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.03.462911,585

Currently, technical challenges persist towards digitization of legacy systems due to the limitation for changes in their design and sensors. This novel toolkit is developed to facilitate easy integration of legacy production machinery and factory floor artifacts with the digital and smart manufacturing environment with no requirement of any physical changes in the machines. The system developed is modular, and allows real-time monitoring of production machinery. The modularity aspect allows the incorporation of new software applications in the current framework of CV Toolkit. To allow connectivity of this toolkit with manufacturing floors in a simple, deployable and cost-effective manner, the toolkit is integrated with a known manufacturing data standard, MTConnect, to “translate” the digital inputs into data streams that can be read by commercial status tracking and reporting software solutions.

In this work, we combined atomistic simulations and conformational dynamics analysis with the ensemble-based mutational profiling of binding interactions for a diverse panel of SARS-CoV-2 spike complexes with nanobodies. Using this computational toolkit we identified dynamic signatures and binding affinity fingerprints for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein complexes with nanobodies Nb6 and Nb20, VHH E, a pair combination VHH E+U, a biparatopic nanobody VHH VE, and a combination of CC12.3 antibody and VHH V/W nanobodies. Through ensemble-based deep mutational profiling of stability and binding affinities, we identify critical hotspots and characterize molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding with single ultra-potent nanobodies, nanobody cocktails and biparatopic nanobodies. By quantifying dynamic and energetic determinants of the SARS-CoV-2 S binding with nanobodies, we also examine the effects of circulating variants and escaping mutations. We found that mutational escape mechanisms may be controlled through structurally and energetically adaptable binding hotspots located in the host receptor-accessible binding epitope that are dynamically coupled to the stability centers in the distant epitope targeted by VHH U/V/W nanobodies. The results of this study suggested a mechanism in which through cooperative dynamic changes, nanobody combinations and biparatopic nanobody can modulate the global protein response and induce the increased resilience to common escape mutants.","Verkhivker, Gennady M.; Agajanian, Steve; Oztas, Deniz Yasar; Gupta, Grace",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.07.451538,585

In Healthcare workers the strongest contributor to vaccine hesitancy was having a Moderate Confidence (OR: 0.323, p=0.042, 95% CI: 0.109-0.958) in the vaccine followed by Moderate Convenience (OR: 0.304, p=0.049, 95% CI: 0.093-0.993) for vaccination Conclusion: Campaigning and communication strategies to reaffirm confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine and educating the general population about the vaccine could lead to increased perception of vaccine safety and effectiveness thereby restoring confidence in vaccine and decreasing vaccine hesitancy. Likewise, working to increase vaccine convenience and decreasing complacency towards the COVID-19 vaccine would translate into high vaccine uptake.","Sheikh, N.

Large outflows were sustained over weeks and most severe for funds with illiquid assets, vulnerable to fire sales, and exposed to sectors hurt by the crisis. By providing a liquidity backstop for their bond holdings, the Federal Reserve bond purchase program helped to reverse outflows especially for the most fragile funds. In turn, the program had spillover effects on primary market issuance and peer funds. The evidence points to a “bond-fund fragility channel” whereby the Fed liquidity backstop transmits to the real economy via funds. © 2021","Falato, A.; Goldstein, I.; Hortaçsu, A.",Journal of Monetary Economics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoneco.2021.07.001,585
175273,The solution is the problem: What a pandemic can reveal about policing,2021,"This paper introduces a new artificial intelligence software which is capable of controlling devices using fingers in the air. With Ubimouse, touch-panels, restaurant ordering systems, ATM systems, and etc., which are commonly used by various people in public, can be contact-less devices. These touch-less devices, especially under the harsh conditions of COVID-19, are desired to prevent infections mediated by touch devices. Also, these devices cannot be used while wearing gloves due to their touch sensing fault. Thus, in fields using gloves, there is a demand for non-contact device operation. To satisfy these demands, we have developed ""UbiMouse"". This is an AI software that allows you to operate the device by moving your fingers toward the device. In the AIs in UbiMouse, a convolution model and a regression model are used to identify fingers' features from camera footage and to estimates the position of a detected finger, respectively. We demonstrate an operation of UbiMouse without contact. Along with this operation in the air, a mouse cursor is guided to the specified location with high accuracy. © 2021 ACM.","Akagawa, D.; Takatsu, J.; Otsu, R.; Hayashi, S.; Vallet, B.","Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques Conference: Emerging Technologies, SIGGRAPH 2021",https://doi.org/10.1145/3450550.3470532,585
175445,Uncharted waters: The effects of COVID-19 on student paramedics,2021,"Motivation With the coronavirus pandemic still raging, prophylactic nasal and early treatment throat sprays could help prevent infection and reduce viral load. Niclosamide has the potential to treat a broad range of viral infections if local bioavailability is optimized as mucin-penetrating solutions as opposed to more traditional microparticle-based sprays that cannot penetrate the mucin. Experimental pH-dependence of supernatant concentrations and dissolution rates of niclosamide were measured in buffered solutions by Nanodrop-UV/Vis-spectroscopy for niclosamide from different suppliers, as precipitated material, and as cosolvates. Data was compared to predictions from Henderson Hasselbalch and precipitation pH models. Optimal microscopy was used to observe the morphologies of precipitated and converted niclosamide. Results Supernatant-concentrations of niclosamide increased with increasing pH, from 1.77uM at pH 3.66 to 30uM at pH 8, and more rapidly from 90uM at pH8.5 to 300uM at pH 9.1, reaching 641uM at pH 9.5. Logarithmic rates for dissolution increased by ∼3x for pHs 8.62 to 9.44. However, when precipitated from supersaturated solution, niclosamide equilibrated to much lower final supernatant concentrations, reflective of more stable polymorphs at each pH that were also apparent for niclosamide from other suppliers and cosolvates. Conclusions Given niclosamide’s activity against COVID19, its more contagious variants, and other respiratory viral infections, these niclosamide solutions, that put the virus in lockdown, could represent universal prophylactic nasal and early treatment throat sprays. As solutions they would be the simplest and potentially most effective formulations from both an efficacy standpoint as well as manufacturing and distribution, with no cold chain. They now just need testing.","Needham, David",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.16.456531,585

Data pertaining to COVID-19 is an area of recent interest. The widespread influence of the virus across the United States creates an obvious need to identify groups of individuals that are at an increased risk of mortality from the virus. We propose a so-called clustered random forest approach to predict COVID-19 patient mortality. We use this approach to examine the hidden heterogeneity of patient frailty by examining demographic information for COVID-19 patients. We find that our clustered random forest approach attains predictive performance comparable to other published methods. We also find that follow-up analysis with neural network modeling and k-means clustering provide insight into the type and magnitude of mortality risks associated with COVID-19.,"Cornelius, Erwin Akman Olcay Hrozencik Dan",Mathematics,https://doi.org/10.3390/math9172043,585

Dog denial of entry reports from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020, stored within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Quarantine Activity Reporting System, were reviewed. Basic descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Reason for denial, country of origin, and month of importation were all examined to determine which countries of origin resulted in the largest number of denials, and whether there was a seasonal change in importations during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020), compared to previous years (2018 and 2019). During 2020, CDC denied entry to 458 dogs. This represents a 52% increase in dogs denied entry compared to the averages in 2018 and 2019. Dogs were primarily denied entry for falsified rabies vaccination certificates (56%). Three countries exported 74% of all dogs denied entry into the United States, suggesting that targeted interventions may be needed for certain countries. Increased attempts to import inadequately vaccinated dogs from countries with canine rabies in 2020 may have been due to the increased demand for domestic pets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Educational messaging should highlight the risk of rabies and the importance of making informed pet purchases from foreign entities to protect pet owners, their families, and the public.","Pieracci, Emily G; Williams, Cara; Wallace, Ryan M; Kalapura, Cheryl; Brown, Clive M",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.453524,585
176111,The role of intolerance of uncertainty in the acquisition and extinction of reward,2020-05-19,"Background: Self-stigma (the internalisation of negative stereotypes) is known to reduce help-seeking behaviours and treatment adherence in people who have a mental illness, resulting in worsening health outcomes. Moreover, self-stigma diminishes self-esteem and self-efficacy, and leads to higher levels of depression. Half of all lifetime cases of mental illness have manifested by the age of 14, and therefore young people are vulnerable to the negative impact of suffering mental illness self-stigma. While literature in this field has been flourishing in recent years, mental illness self-stigma remains poorly understood in youth. It is important that we seek to understand what is currently known about mental illness self-stigma in young people, and subsequently use this information to guide future research to advance knowledge of this topic. To date, a scoping review which maps the available literature on mental illness self-stigma in young people has yet to be conducted. Here, we outline the protocol for a scoping review on mental illness self-stigma in young people. Methods: This protocol outlines the process of conducting a scoping review of primary research concerning mental illness self-stigma in young people. The Joanna Briggs Institute guidance on best practice for conducting a scoping review will utilised throughout. A systematic search of appropriate databases will be conducted which will allow for a two-step screening process and data charting. Inclusion criteria for this review dictates that eligible studies will i) include a population within the age range of 10-35 (or mean age within this range), ii) include the term self-stigma or internalised stigma relating to mental health/illness/disorder, iii) be primary research, iv) be published post-2009 (following the seminal study by Moses, 2009) and v) be published in English. Discussion: The findings of the scoping review outlined in this protocol will be used to inform future research which aims to explore self-stigmatising attitudes and beliefs of young people experiencing mental illness. This research will result in co-produced, impactful resources for young people on the topic of mental illness self-stigma with the aim of raising awareness and stigma reduction.","Taylor, R.

176925,Ethical challenges in the treatment of anxiety,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 worldwide emergence and evolution has resulted in variants containing mutations resulting in immune evasive epitopes that decrease vaccine efficacy. We acquired clinical samples, analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomes, used the most worldwide emerged spike mutations from Variants of Concern/Interest, and developed an algorithm for monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platform. The algorithm partitions logarithmic-transformed prevalence data monthly and Pearson’s correlation determines exponential emergence. The SARS-CoV-2 genome evaluation indicated 49 mutations. Nine of the ten most worldwide prevalent (>70%) spike protein changes have r-values >0.9. The tenth, D614G, has a prevalence >99% and r-value of 0.67. The resulting algorithm is based on the patterns these ten substitutions elucidated. The strong positive correlation of the emerged spike protein changes and algorithmic predictive value can be harnessed in designing vaccines with relevant immunogenic epitopes.

The data is collated, analyzed, and reported by government agencies, corporate companies, institutions, and even academia. Some of these reports are the NNPC and DPR annual oil and gas reports. The annual oil and gas reports contain data tables, charts, and data driven insights. Considering the growing uncertainty in business intelligence triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and the fast-paced 4th industrial revolution, the future of data reporting, analyzing, and presentation is also experiencing a new normal. Oil and gas stakeholders desire quick data-driven and actionable insights to reduce business risks caused by the impacts of these key drivers. This article explores and presents the use of Power BI on Nigerian gas data from 2000 to 2018. It extracts data on demand, production, utilization, gas flare volumes, export, current infrastructure capacity, domestic gas supply, and other relevant data categories. The collated data is developed into a dataset by appending and merging tables from the different reports. This data is prepared, and model relationships are created to answers questions on demand, production, infrastructure, and sustainability of the Nigerian Gas market. Empirical results show that new insights can be obtained from the dataset using new tools and a thoughtful data design process. These insights are presented on a dashboard where key takeaways for quick business decisions and policy implementations are easily assessed.

Clinical symptoms range from barely noticeable to very severe. It is crucial to recognize imaging patterns of COVID-19, allowing for better diagnosis and treatment. Diagnostic imaging is also essential in monitoring patients in the course of the disease. Objective: In our pictorial review we describe the most common pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19, and show the typical and non-typical features of COVID-19 encountered in our hospital in Lublin, Poland. Imaging the disease progression is also visualized to help realize how pulmonary changes occur over the time. State of knowledge and Conclusions: COVID-19 involves both lung parenchyma and interstitium and has multiple imaging features, varying form ground glass opacities (GGO), consolidations, reticular interstitial pattern, honeycombing or crazy-paving. Mediastinal and hilar lymph node enlargement or pleural effusion may appear, but are rare and atypical. GGO are located peripherally, bilaterally and predominantly in the lower lobes, and in the early stage are better seen on CT imaging. Progression of imaging findings take different times, with the peak of of imaging features appearing around 10–14 days after initial symptoms. While it is harder to discern subtle changes on CXR, progression can be very well monitored by his method. Final pulmonary consequences of the disease should be assessed with the use of CT.","Kurys-Denis, Ewa Podgórska Katarzyna Prystupa Andrzej",Medycyna Środowiskowa = Environmental Medicine,https://doi.org/10.26444/jpccr/131715,585

Learning from our students’ experience during this period will help us shape future hybrid delivery so that it best fits Bioscience students. This pedagogical study explored Aston University’s Bioscience students’ experiences of studying from home, and the impact of the lockdown on mental wellbeing and quality of life. 151 students completed an online survey during August 2020, which included open and closed questions. Analysis of survey data revealed that a majority of students reported positive experiences of online open-book assessments and most would welcome this format in the future. The majority of students faced no technical issues, predominantly stating that they also had good internet connectivity. Shifting to remote learning and online classrooms uncovered conflicting preferences;despite wanting more interactive lectures, only half of the students were comfortable interacting using video cameras. Free text responses provided an insight into how some students reported an inadequate home working space/environment and lacked necessary items such as a desk, highlighting how remote working may intensify social and digital inequality - particularly for students from more deprived households. Wider detrimental experiences of lockdown included dissatisfaction with access to healthcare, decreased concentration, sleeping difficulties and a decline in mental wellbeing. Education strategies going forward will need to address the mental health needs of students who have suffered during the pandemic. Our university, amongst others, is embracing hybrid course delivery, which could offer a solution to ensuring Bioscience students receive hands-on laboratory experience and face-to-face contact to remain motivated and benefit from the on-campus facilities and support, whilst allowing students some of the flexibility afforded by remote study.

While trials on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) prophylaxis are ongoing, concrete evidence is lacking. The study aimed to determine the relative efficacy of various doses of oral HCQ in prophylaxis and mitigating the severity of COVID-19 in healthcare workers. Methods: This was a prospective cohort with four arms (high, medium, low dose, and control) of HCQ prophylaxis, used by healthcare workers at a tertiary care center in India. Participants were grouped as per their opting for any one arm on a voluntary basis as per institute policy under the Government guidance. The outcomes studied were COVID-19 positivity by RT-PCR and its severity assessed by WHO COVID-19 severity scale. Results: Total 486 participants were enrolled, of which 29 (6%) opted for low dose, 2 (<1%) medium dose, and none for high dose HCQ while 455 (93.6%) were in the control arm. Of the 164 participants who underwent RT-PCR, 96 (58.2%) tested positive. Out of these 96 positive cases, the majority of them (79 of 96 [82.3%]) were ambulatory and were managed conservatively at home. Only 17.7% (17 of 96) participants, all of them from the control group, required hospitalization with the mild-moderate disease. None of the participants had severe disease, COVID-related complications, ICU stay, or death. The difference in the outcome assessed amongst the various arms was statistically insignificant (p value >0.05). Conclusion: This single-center study demonstrated that HCQ prophylaxis in healthcare workers does not cause a significant reduction in COVID-19 as well as mitigating its severity in those infected.

Besides a standard geometric Brownian motion, another two driving processes are taken into account: a stationary Poisson point process and a continuous-time finite-state Markov chain. The classical harvesting problem for this model is a big difficult puzzle since the corresponding Fokker–Planck equations with three types of noise are very difficult to solve. Our main goal of this paper is to work out the optimization problem with respect to stationary probability density. One of the main contributions is to provide a new equivalent approach to overcome this problem. More precisely, an ergodic method is used to show the almost surely equivalency between the time averaging yield and sustainable yield. Results show that the optimal strategy changes with environment. An interesting thing is that the optimal strategy for each state is equivalent to the global optimality.","Zou, Xiaoling; Wang, Ke",Nonlinear Analysis: Hybrid Systems,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1751570X14000065; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751570X14000065,585

Then, the shift in our aims leads us to minor changes in the content of the questionnaire. There are not only significant differences in the proportion of workers in the office and at home during the different periods of the lockdown. After its end, there was a significant increase in the number of those who had started working at home-more than one half. Compared to the period prior to the lockdown, they have a tolerant attitude to their work from home and believe that their productivity might remain the same. For many of them the change was an unavoidable obligation so they would prefer to return to the traditional workplace. The results suggest that more than one fifth want to continue working from home permanently, about one third more frequently than before, more than a quarter sometimes and just one seventh not at all. We studied the issues related to their productivity and its limits during all three stages. There are three important reasons for the fall in productivity related to e-working: (1) Providing childcare/home schooling, pet sitting and/or care for others while working (>one-fourth);(2) Work-from-home routine (>one-fourth);and (3) Having less work to do (>one-fifth).","Beno, M.; Hvorecky, J.",Frontiers in Communication,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomm.2021.641199,585
179120,Controversy with bromhexine in COVID-19;where we stand,2021,"Expanded CAG/CTG repeats underlie thirteen neurological disorders, including myotonic dystrophy (DM1) and Huntington’s disease (HD). Upon expansion, CAG/CTG repeat loci acquire heterochromatic characteristics. This observation raises the hypothesis that repeat expansion provokes changes to higher order chromatin folding and thereby affects both gene expression in cis and the genetic instability of the repeat tract. Here we tested this hypothesis directly by performing 4C sequencing at the DMPK and HTT loci from DM1 and HD patient-derived cells. Surprisingly, chromatin contacts remain unchanged upon repeat expansion at both loci. This was true for loci with different DNA methylation levels and CTCF binding. Repeat sizes ranging from 15 to 1,700 displayed strikingly similar chromatin interaction profiles. Our findings argue that extensive changes in heterochromatic properties are not enough to alter chromatin folding at expanded CAG/CTG repeat loci. Moreover, the ectopic insertion of an expanded repeat tract did not change three-dimensional chromatin contacts. We conclude that expanded CAG/CTG repeats have little to no effect on chromatin conformation.","Buendía, Gustavo A.

Spatial nonlinear modeling of social and economic patterns,2020,"ABSTRACT Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) in the treatment of COVID-19. Participants: 110 adults aged 18 to 65 years with moderate to severe COVID-19. Interventions: 63, 90, and 126 mg/kg/day 2-DG plus standard of care (SOC) versus SOC only. Main Outcome Measures: Times to maintaining SpO2 [≥]94% on room air discharge, clinical recovery, vital signs normalisation, improvement by 1 and 2 points on WHO 10-point ordinal scale, negative conversion on RT-PCR, intensive care, and mortality. Results: Patients treated with 90 mg/kg/day 2-DG plus SOC showed better outcomes. Time to maintaining SpO2 [≥]94% was significantly shorter in the 2-DG 90 mg compared to SOC (median 2.5 days vs 5 days, Hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]=2.3 [1.14, 4.64], p=0.0201). Times to discharge from isolation ward, to clinical recovery, and to vital signs normalisation were significantly shorter for the 2-DG 90 mg group. All three doses of 2-DG were well tolerated. Thirty-three (30.3%) patients reported 65 adverse events and were mostly (86%) mild. Conclusion: 2-DG 90 mg/kg/day as adjunct to SOC showed clinical benefits over SOC alone in the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19. The promising trends observed in current phase-II study encourage confirmatory evaluation of the efficacy and safety of 2-DG in a larger phase-III trial.","Bhatt, A.

179757,The effort of cooperation. State-regions relations in Italy at the time of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND&AIMS Infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN) is a highly morbid complication of acute pancreatitis(AP). Since there is evidence of immunosuppression in the early phase of AP, immune enhancement using Thymosin alpha 1 (T1), which stimulates both innate and adaptive immunity, may be a therapeutic strategy to prevent IPN. Our aim was to assess the efficacy of early T1 treatment on the development of IPN. METHODS We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with predicted severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP). ANP patients with an APACHE II score[≥]8 admitted within seven days of the advent of symptoms were considered eligible. Enrolled patients were assigned to receive a subcutaneous injection of T1 1.6 mg, every 12 hours for the first 7 days and 1.6 mg once a day for the subsequent 7 days or matching placebo (normal saline). The primary outcome was the development of IPN during the index admission. RESULTS From Mar 2017 through Dec 2020, 508 patients were randomized at 16 hospitals, of whom 254 were assigned to receive T1 and 254 placebo. During the index admission, 40/254 (15.7%) patients in the T1 group developed IPN compared with 46/254 patients (18.1%) in the placebo group (difference -2.4% [95%CI -7.4% to 5.0%]; p=0.47). The results were similar in four predefined subgroups. There was no difference in other major complications, including new-onset organ failure (10.6% vs. 15.0%; p=0.15), bleeding (6.3% vs. 3.5%; p=0.15), and gastrointestinal fistula (2.0% vs. 2.4%; p=0.75) during the index admission. CONCLUSIONS The immune-enhancing T1 treatment of patients with predicted severe ANP did not reduce the incidence of IPN during the index admission.","Ke, L.; Zhou, J.; Mao, W.; Chen, T.; Zhu, Y.; Pan, X.; Mei, H.; Singh, V.; Buxbaum, J.; Doig, G.; He, C.; Gu, W.; Lu, W.; Tu, S.; Ni, H.; Zhang, G.; Zhao, X.; Sun, J.; Chen, W.; Song, J.; Shao, M.; Tu, J.; Xia, L.; He, W.; Zhu, Q.; Li, K.; Yao, H.; Wu, J.; Fu, L.; Wendi, J.; He, Z.; Lin, J.; Li, B.; Zhihui, T.; Windsor, J.; Liu, Y.; Li, W.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.09.21261580v1?rss=1,585
180048,Working from home: women between public and domestic spheres after the outbreak of COVID-19,2021,"Background: COVID-19 changed access to healthcare, including vaccinations, in the United Kingdom (UK). This study explored UK women's experiences of accessing pertussis vaccination during pregnancy and infant vaccinations during COVID-19. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was completed, between 3rd August-11th October 2020, by 1404 women aged over 16 years who were pregnant at some point after the first UK lockdown from March 23rd, 2020. Ten follow-up semi-structured interviews were conducted. Results: Most women surveyed were pregnant (65.7%) and a third postnatal (34.3%). Almost all women (95.6%) were aware that pertussis vaccination is recommended in pregnancy. Most pregnant (72.1%) and postnatal women (84.0%) had received pertussis vaccination; however, access issues were reported. Over a third (39.6%) of women had a pregnancy vaccination appointment changed. COVID-19 made it physically difficult to access pregnancy vaccinations for one fifth (21.5%) of women and physically difficult to access infant vaccinations for almost half of women (45.8%). Nearly half of women (45.2%) reported feeling less safe attending pregnancy vaccinations and over three quarters (76.3%) less safe attending infant vaccinations due to COVID-19. The majority (94.2%) felt it was important to get their baby vaccinated during COVID-19. Pregnant women from ethnic-minorities and lower-income households were less likely to have been vaccinated. Minority-ethnicity women were more likely to report access problems and feeling less safe attending vaccinations for both themselves and their babies. Qualitative analysis found women experienced difficulties accessing antenatal care and relied on knowledge from previous pregnancies to access vaccines in pregnancy. Conclusion: During the ongoing and future pandemics, healthcare services should prioritise equitable access to routine vaccinations, including tailoring services for ethnic-minority families who experience greater barriers to vaccination.","Skirrow, H.; Barnett, S.; Bell, S.

Objective The current study aims to explore parents’ experiences of participating in a parent-child telehealth intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also aimed at exploring clinicians’ experiences of delivering the service, including key strengths and challenges. Participants and setting Participants were five mothers who took part in Berry Street’s Restoring Childhood service during the COVID-19 pandemic in Melbourne, Australia, and 14 Restoring Childhood clinicians, delivering the service across metropolitan and regional sites. Methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted, and data were analysed using thematic analysis to determine key themes and sub-themes within the data. Results Parents identified several strengths and benefits of Restoring Childhood delivered via telehealth including improvements in parenting skills and confidence, parent-child relationships, and children’s emotional-behavioural functioning. Both parents and clinicians noted the creativity utilised during the online approach, and the increased accessibly it offered for families. However, challenges to the telehealth approaches were also noted. Clinicians discussed important considerations for telehealth within this context including safety and confidentiality, technology challenges, and challenges working from home. Conclusions The current study highlights the promise of telehealth interventions for parents and children who have experienced IPV. It also poses several important considerations for the use of telehealth within this setting and emphasises the need for rigorous evaluations of telehealth services for children exposed to IPV.","Fogarty, Alison; Savopoulos, Priscilla; Seymour, Monique; Cox, Allison; Williams, Kirsten; Petrie, Skye; Herman, Sue; Toone, Emma; Schroeder, Kim; Giallo, Rebecca",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145213421004348; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145213421004348?v=s5,585

Thus, having a system that automatically detects COVID-19 in tomography (CT) images can assist in quantifying the severity of the illness. Unfortunately, labelling chest CT scans requires significant domain expertise, time, and effort. We address these labelling challenges by only requiring point annotations, a single pixel for each infected region on a CT image. This labeling scheme allows annotators to label a pixel in a likely infected region, only taking 1-3 seconds, as opposed to 10-15 seconds to segment a region. Conventionally, segmentation models train on point-level annotations using the cross-entropy loss function on these labels. However, these models often suffer from low precision. Thus, we propose a consistency-based (CB) loss function that encourages the output predictions to be consistent with spatial transformations of the input images. The experiments on 3 open-source COVID-19 datasets show that this loss function yields significant improvement over conventional point-level loss functions and almost matches the performance of models trained with full supervision with much less human effort.

Students of the subject had to learn how to prepare simple web pages, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript programming languages. To this end, flipped classroom technique was used to present the necessary contents, combined with an adaptation of Aronson's cooperative learning puzzle technique, used to carry out a group practice that reflected the knowledge acquired. It is worth mentioning, as a complement to the two techniques used, the use of an adapted assessment rubric, which was provided to the students at the beginning of the teaching block. The evaluation was carried out during two consecutive academic years, 2018/2019 and 2019/2020. There were important differences between the two studies: in the first study, students' previous self-assigned level was much higher (2.8 points as opposed to 1.4 points on a scale of 1 to 5). The other difference, even more relevant, was that in the second year all teaching was done at home, in a non-attendance format, on a mandatory basis, due to the period of confinement decreed by the state of alarm at that moment, because of the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, popularly known as coronavirus. It is remarkable that, despite these differences, the students expressed their satisfaction with the learning acquired and with the tasks performed in both cases. The techniques used were well-appreciated, in first year more than in the second, and especially flipped classroom. Scores obtained were, in addition, always very relevant.","Lazaro-Carrascosa, C.; Hernan-Losada, I.; Palacios-Alonso, D.; Velazquez-Iturbide, A.",Education in the Knowledge Society,https://doi.org/10.14201/eks.23617,585

Additionally, dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) analysis is employed to depict the changing correlation in volatility. The empirical results also show that the yields of ASEAN4 bonds increase with emerging market risks, and the exchange rate can act as a buffer to reduce spillover. Given that ASEAN4 governments have issued a large number of government bonds to finance their large fiscal spending during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the return and volatility spillovers from the US to ASEAN4 could be important factors to consider when the US unwinds its unconventional monetary policy and normalizes its interest rates in the medium to long term.","Tsang, Andrew Yiu Matthew S.; Nguyen, Huy Toan",Journal of Asian Economics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asieco.2021.101343,585

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is one of the key physiological systems that counterbalances this systemic inflammation through changes in adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol. These hormones normally exhibit highly correlated ultradian pulsatility with an amplitude modulated by circadian processes. However, these dynamics are disrupted by major surgery and critical illness. In this work, we characterise the inflammatory, ACTH and cortisol responses of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and show that the HPA axis response can be classified into one of three phenotypes: single-pulse, two-pulses and multiple-pulses dynamics. We develop a mathematical model of cortisol secretion and metabolism that predicts the physiological mechanisms responsible for these different phenotypes. We show that the effects of inflammatory mediators are important only in the single-pulse pattern in which normal pulsatility is lost – suggesting that this phenotype could be indicative of the greatest inflammatory response. Investigating whether and how these phenotypes are correlated with clinical outcomes will be critical to patient prognosis and designing interventions to improve recovery.","Galvis, Daniel; Zavala, Eder; Walker, Jamie J.; Upton, Thomas; Lightman, Stafford L.; Angelini, Gianni D.; Evans, Jon; Rogers, Chris A.; Phillips, Kirsty; Gibbison, Ben",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.16.456512,585

This study aimed to evaluate the patient acceptability of a novel method for providing cataract follow up over the telephone (TFU) by looking at multiple factors of acceptability. This methodology can be used as a reproducible framework to guide co-development of future technology such as automated artificial-intelligence (AI) enabled TFU.MethodsPatients between the ages of 66 and 90 were called 3 weeks after their surgery by an ophthalmologist to assess if they had symptoms that could indicate a complication and require face-to-face review. We interviewed 30 consecutive patients who had received TFU within the last month. Patient acceptability was assessed through the validated Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) and the likert scale responses were analysed. Qualitative data was collected through a semi structured questionnaire and a Braun and Clarke (2006) method of thematic analysis was carried out.ResultsThe majority of patients found that TFU post cataract operation was an acceptable way to receive follow up. On average patients scored 4.94/5 on the likert scale for the simplicity and ease of use. Overarching themes that emerged were that TFU is more desirable as it saves time, travel and NHS resources. Overall, patients felt that if they had a postoperative complication they would have preferred to have seen a clinician in person. We found patients‘ views influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic meaning they saw additional benefits of telephone follow up compared to face-to-face review.ConclusionsThe majority of patients felt that TFU after cataract surgery was an acceptable way to receive healthcare. This has implications for how follow up is provided after the most common operation in the UK and worldwide and opens the possibility of this being provided by an automated AI driven system in the future.","Khavandi, Sarah Lim Ernest Mole Guy",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.110,585

(Special Section: Pandemics and sustainability.)",2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the urgency to bridge the digital divide, as those without reliable internet, adequate devices, and digital literacy skills were severely disadvantaged when most essential activities moved online. This study examines how the pandemic has affected women recently released from jail or prison, a group that was already at a disadvantage in terms of digital access and skills even before the pandemic. Our interviews with 45 women in transition show that their lack of stable access to the internet and digital devices during the pandemic influenced their post-incarceration supervision requirements, job applications, educational opportunities, and others. These women navigated the challenges by working with their social connections (e.g., friends and neighbors) and relying on emergency resources deployed by local institutions during the pandemic. Those staying in transitional houses before being fully released into communities indicated that they often depended on facility staff or family/friends in the community for pandemic-related information due to their limited access to the internet in those facilities. These and other findings from this research provide insights into the technological challenges and needs of marginalized women during the public health crisis.

Such technologies are essential to support seroprevalence studies, vaccine clinical trials, and to monitor quality and duration of immunity. We developed a microfluidic nano-immunnoassay for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 1024 samples per device. The method achieved a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 98% based on the analysis of 289 human serum samples. To eliminate the need for venipuncture, we developed low-cost, ultra-low volume whole blood sampling methods based on two commercial devices and repurposed a blood glucose test strip. The glucose test strip permits the collection, shipment, and analysis of 0.6 {micro}L whole blood easily obtainable from a simple fingerprick. The nano-immunoassay platform achieves high-throughput, high sensitivity and specificity, negligible reagent consumption, and a decentralized and simple approach to blood sample collection. We expect this technology to be immediately applicable to current and future SARS-CoV-2 related serological studies and to protein biomarker diagnostics in general.","Swank, Zoe; Michielin, GrÃ©goire; Yip, Hon Ming; Cohen, Patrick; Andrey, Diego O.; Vuilleumier, Nicolas; Kaiser, Laurent; Eckerle, Isabella; Meyer, Benjamin; Maerkl, Sebastian J.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208280,585

182313,The lost generation of entrepreneurs? The impact of COVID-19 on the availability of risk capital in Canada,2021,"COVID-19 is a new disease that has become a pandemic. This disease should be watched out for because transmission is relatively fast, has a mortality rate that cannot be ignored, and there is no definitive therapy. After COVID 19, people will be more selective in the food they eat. The types of food chosen were those that have health benefits, especially as immunity boosters. The problem was what types of products can provide these benefits en masse, cheap, and easy to access. This review aims to explore the potential of the Moringa plant as a plant that can be a source of functional food as a post-COVID 19 immune booster. The method used was to review various journal references that discuss research results related to the use of Moringa plants and specifically those related to the anticipation of COVID 19. Based on the results of a review of various literature, it was found that the Moringa plant has various functional properties. These health functions include, among others, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, antioxidant, anti-tumor, anticancer, antihypertensive, antiasthmatic, antiurolithiasis, anthelmintic, anti-fertility, antihyperthyroid, and anti-Alzheimer. One of the roles of Moringa plants in dealing with COVID 19 was as an immune booster. This is important because one of the factors that cause the different severity of COVID 19 patients is immunity. People with good body immunity tend to be able to survive infection and attacks by the SARS-Cov-2. Some of the components of Moringa that play a role in this were kaempferol, pterygospermin, morphine, quercetin, and apigenin-7-O-rutinoside. Apigenin has the highest activity against SARS-Cov-2-MPro (the main protease of COVID 19). From the results of this review, it can be concluded that the Moringa plant has the potential as an immune booster against the SARS-Cov-2 (COVID 19).","Fajri, M.",IOP Conference Series.

Analysing public opinion and misinformation in a COVID-19 Telegram group chat,2020-10-20,"The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on national economies are characterized as the worst economic turmoil in recent years, as economic growth slowed to the level of the 2008 global financial crisis. At the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020, economic growth surveys did not project that the novel virus could have a negative impact on economic growth. As a result of the rapid spread of the virus and the increase in the number of infection cases, national governments took strict measures to limit the spread of the virus, which led to a significant deterioration in the economic situation in all industries of the economy. Agriculture plays an important role in providing food to the country’s population, yet the pandemic made a negative impact on sales volumes and prices in the domestic and international markets. The research aims to assess the impacts of the pandemic on milk supply chains in Latvia and come up with solutions to stabilizing the situation in the dairy sector. The national restrictions to combat the pandemic also hampered the dairy sector concerning the sale of raw milk and finished products in foreign markets, thereby leading to overproduction and stockpiling of the finished products, price dumping and a significant decrease in milk purchase prices to or below the production cost level for many dairy farms. Although there is no indication that the pandemic would lead to a decrease in the numbers of livestock and farms or output in early 2021, it is too early to assess the overall impact of the pandemic on dairy farming, as uncertainty over the duration of pandemic restrictions is a major risk to farm survival. The operation of the dairy sector was stabilized by means of the support provided by the government, as well as the farms’ accumulated financial and feed resources. In order to identify future challenges for milk supply chains, the research performed an analysis of operational risks for milk producers and processors to identify the most important risks and design recommendations for their elimination. The longer there is uncertainty about the return of the dairy sector to pre-pandemic output levels, the more likely it is that the pandemic is going to lead to a decrease in the numbers of dairy livestock and farms. © Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies, all rights reserved","Pilvere, I.; Upite, I.; Muska, A.; Zdanovskis, K.; Nipers, A.; Janmere, L.",Rural Sustainability Research,https://doi.org/10.2478/plua-2021-0007,585

As both testing for SARS Cov-2 and death registrations are incomplete or not yet available in many countries, the full impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is currently unknown in many world regions. Methods. We studied the Covid-19 and all-cause mortality in 18 Indian states (combined population of 1.26 billion) with available all-cause mortality data during the pandemic for the entire state or for large cities: Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Assam, Bihar, Odisha, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh. Excess mortality was calculated by comparison with available data from years 2015-2019. The known Covid-19 deaths reported by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering for a state were assumed to be accurate, unless excess mortality data suggested a higher toll during the pandemic. Data from Uttar Pradesh were not included in the final model due to anomalies. Results. In several regions, fewer deaths were registered in 2020 than expected. The excess mortality in Mumbai (in Maharashtra) in 2020 was 137.0 / 100K. Areas in Tamil Nadu, Kolkata (in West Bengal), Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Haryana, and Andhra Pradesh saw spikes in mortality in the spring of 2021. Conclusions. The pandemic-related mortality through June 30, 2021 in 17 Indian states was estimated to be 132.9 to 194.4 per 100,000 population. If these rates apply to India as a whole, then between 1.80 to 2.63 million people may have perished in India as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic by June 30, 2021. This per-capita mortality rate is similar to that in the United States and many other regions.","Leffler, C. T.; Lykins, J.

In Ethiopia, as of September 27, 2020, a total of 72,700 cases and 1165 deaths were reported. ObjectiveThe study aimed to assess the determinants of death in Severe COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia. MethodsA case-control study of 147 Severe COVID-19 patients (49 deaths and 98 discharged alive cases) was conducted from August to September 2020. A comparison of underlying characteristics between cases (death) and controls (alive) was assessed using a chi-square test and an independent t-test with a p-value of <0.05 considered as having a statistically significant difference. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to assess a statistically significant association between the predictor variables and outcome of Severe COVID-19 (Alive Vs Death) where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR, and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results. ResultsHaving diabetes mellitus (AOR= 3.257, 95% CI= 1.348, 7.867, p-value=0.00), fever (AOR=0.328, 95% CI: 0.123, 0.878, p-value= 0.027) and Shortness of breath (AOR= 4.034, 95% CI= 1.481, 10.988, p-value=0.006) were found to be significant predictors of death in Severe COVID-19 patients.

191153,COVID-19: Education and Licensure Disruption.,2020-08-01,"A growing body of research suggests that neuropsychiatric disorders are closely associated with a background state of chronic, low-grade inflammation. This insight highlights that these disorders are not just localized to dysfunction within the brain, but also have a systemic aspect, which accounts for the frequent comorbid presentation of chronic inflammatory conditions and metabolic syndromes. It is possible that a treatment resistant subgroup of neuropsychiatric patients may benefit from treatment regimens that target their associated proinflammatory state. Lifestyle factors such as physical activity (PA) and exercise (i.e. structured PA) are known to influence mental health. In turn, mental disorders may limit health-seeking behaviors - a proposed ""bidirectional relationship"" that perpetuates psychopathology. PA is renowned for its positive physical, physiological and mental health benefits. Evidence now points to inflammatory pathways as a potential mechanism for PA in improving mental illness. Relevant pathways include modulation of immune-neuroendocrine and neurotransmitter systems, the production of tissue-derived immunological factors that alter the inflammatory milieu and neurotrophins that are critical mediators of neuroplasticity. In this paper, we will focus on the role of PA in positively improving mental health through potential modulation of chronic inflammation, which is often found in individuals with mental disorders. In a related paper by Edirappuli and colleagues (2020), we will focus on the role of nutrition (another significant lifestyle factor) on mental health. Thus, inflammation appears to be a central process underlying mental illness, which may be mitigated by lifestyle modifications. Lifestyle factors are advantageous as first-line interventions due to their cost efficacy, low side-effect profile, and both preventative and therapeutic attributes. By promoting these lifestyle modifications and addressing their limitations and barriers to their adoption, it is hoped that their preventative and remedial benefits may galvanize therapeutic progress for neuropsychiatric disorders.","Venkatesh, Ashwin; Edirappuli, Shantal D; Zaman, Haris Pedersen; Zaman, Rashid",Psychiatria Danubina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890372/,585

The subject of whether hospitalised children should be visited by other children has been accorded minimal attention. OBJECTIVE To determine the current status of visitation of the hospitalised children and the parents and healthcare providers'views on hospitalised children being visited by other children. DESIGN A descriptive study carried out using quantitative and qualitative methods in two phases SETTING All paediatric wards at Kenyatta National Hospital and Gertrudes Children's Hospital. SUBJECTS Nurses, paediatricians and parents of hospitalised children. RESULTS A total of 161 parents participated in phase I of the study whereas 11 nurses not specialised in paediatric nursing, 13 paediatric nurses, 12 nurse managers, fur paediatricians and13 parents participated in phase II of the study. The study established that visiting of the hospitalised child by family members especially children aged below twelve years is severely restricted particularly in the public hospital. Despite this, however, majority of the healthcare providers and the parents acknowledged the importance of the hospitalised children being visited by other children. This is because it promotes healing, gives the sick child psychological satisfaction and relieves anxiety in the hospitalised child, the accompanying parent and the other children. The risk of exposing the visiting children to infection was cited as the main reason for the restrictions. CONCLUSION Both the healthcare providers and the hospitalised children's parents appreciate the importance of the hospitalised child being visited by other children. There is a need to review healthcare policies to make provision for hospitalised children to be visited by other children.","Makworo, D G M; Bwibo, N; Omoni, G",East African medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26866094/,585

Cows in group I were inoculated IM and intramammarily (IMm) with Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC) tissue culture-propagated modified-live Nebraska calf diarrhea bovine rotavirus with added adjuvant (OARDC vaccine-immunized cows). Group II cows were given IM injections of a commercial modified-live rotavirus-coronavirus vaccine (commercial vaccine-immunized cows), and the remaining 5 cows were noninoculated controls (group III). Rotavirus antibody in colostrum and milk was mainly associated with immunoglobulin (Ig)G1, and less so with IgG2, IgA, and IgM, as analyzed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using monospecific anti-bovine IgG1, IgG2, IgM, and IgA sera. In serum, the rotavirus antibody was distributed almost equally between IgG1 and IgG2. The same relationships appeared in both immunized and nonvaccinated cows. All OARDC vaccine-injected cows had virus-neutralization (VN) and ELISA IgG1 rotavirus antibody titers in serum and mammary secretions at significantly increased levels (at least 100-fold; P less than 0.05) compared with the titers in groups II (commercial vaccine-immunized cows) and III (controls). Serum, colostrum, and milk antibody titers from these latter 2 groups did not differ statistically. The ELISA IgG2, IgA, and IgM rotavirus antibody titers also were significantly greater in mammary secretions from OARDC vaccine-immunized cows than in groups II and III cows. There was a high correlation between ELISA IgG1 and VN rotavirus antibody titers for all samples tested (r = 0.97, P less than 0.001), but ELISA IgG1 antibody titers were consistently higher than VN titers. The ELISA IgG1 and VN antibody titers of milk samples collected from cows 30 days after parturition were higher from the OARDC vaccine-immunized cows (ELISA IgG1, geometric mean titer (GMT) = 3,511; VN GMT = 1,689) than were titers from the group II cows (ELISA IgG1 GMT = 39; VN GMT = 33) or group III cows (ELISA IgG1 GMT = 21; VN GMT = 19). These results indicate that IM plus IMm immunization of pregnant cows, using modified-live bovine rotavirus with added adjuvant, may significantly enhance serum, colostrum, and milk rotavirus antibody titers, whereas IM vaccinal inoculation of pregnant cows with a commercial modified-live rotavirus-coronavirus vaccine may not.","Saif, L J; Smith, K L; Landmeier, B J; Bohl, E H; Theil, K W; Todhunter, D A",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6322624/,585

Size variation in the surface (SU) glycoprotein, characterized by duplication and insertion, has been observed during in vivo infection with several lentiviruses, including bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV), equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1. These duplication/insertion events are thought to occur through a mechanism of template switching/strand transfer during reverse transcription. Studies of RNA recombination in a number of virus systems indicate that cis-acting sequences can modulate the frequency of template switching/strand transfer. The size variable region of EIAV and BIV SU glycoproteins was examined and an AU-rich region and regions of nucleotide sequence identity that may facilitate template switching/strand transfer were identified. An in vitro strand transfer assay using donor and acceptor templates derived from the size variable region in BIV env detected both precise and imprecise strand transfer products, in addition to full-length products. Sequence analysis of clones obtained from imprecise strand transfer products showed that 87.5% had crossover sites within 10 nt of the crossover site observed in vivo. Mutations in the donor template which altered either the AU-rich region or nucleotide sequence identity dramatically decreased the frequency of imprecise strand transfer. Together, these results suggest that cis-acting elements can modulate non-homologous recombination events during reverse transcription and may contribute to the genetic and biological diversity of lentiviruses in vivo.","Li, Y; Carpenter, S",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11714975/,585

Here we demonstrated that the N-acetylglucosamine-binding protein from Urtica dioica (UDA) prevents HIV entry and eventually selects for viruses in which conserved N-glycosylation sites in GP120 were deleted. In contrast to the mannose-binding proteins, which have a 50-100-fold decreased antiviral activity against the UDA-exposed mutant viruses, UDA has decreased anti-HIV activity to a very limited extent, even against those mutant virus strains that lack at least 9 of 22 ( approximately 40%) glycosylation sites in their GP120 envelope. Therefore, UDA represents the prototype of a new conceptual class of carbohydrate-binding agents with an unusually specific and targeted drug resistance profile. It forces HIV to escape drug pressure by deleting the indispensable glycans on its GP120, thereby obligatorily exposing previously hidden immunogenic epitopes on its envelope.","Balzarini, Jan; Van Laethem, Kristel; Hatse, Sigrid; Froeyen, Matheus; Peumans, Willy; Van Damme, Els; Schols, Dominique",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16183648/,585

The objective of this study was to evaluate a human group A rotavirus assay (ImmunoCardSTAT Rotavirus [ICS-RV]) as an on-site diagnostic test for bovine rotavirus. When used with a collection of bovine diarrhea samples submitted to the Virology Section of the Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health at Michigan State University and compared to a bovine group A rotavirus-specific reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), the ICS-RV assay had a sensitivity and specificity of 87.0 and 93.6%, respectively. A commercially available group A rotavirus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Pathfinder; Sanofi Diagnostics, Redmond, Wash.), when used with the same fecal sample collection and compared to the same RT-PCR, had a sensitivity and specificity of 78.3 and 67.7%, respectively. Subsequently, the ICS-RV assay, RT-PCR, and a different commercially available group A rotavirus ELISA (Rotaclone; Meridian Diagnostics, Cincinnati, Ohio) were used to evaluate fecal samples collected from neonatal calves experimentally infected with bovine rotavirus. When diarrheic fecal samples that were positive for bovine rotavirus by RT-PCR were evaluated, the ICS-RV assay and the Rotaclone assay detected bovine rotavirus 85 and 95% of the time, respectively. Based on these studies, the ICS-RV assay appears to be an excellent test for detecting group A bovine rotaviruses. This assay may be useful as an on-site diagnostic test for veterinarians as an aid in the management of bovine neonatal diarrhea.","Maes, Roger K; Grooms, Daniel L; Wise, Annabel G; Han, Cunqin; Ciesicki, Valerie; Hanson, Lora; Vickers, Mary Lynne; Kanitz, Charles; Holland, Robert",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12517863/,585

Our aim was to assess the frequency of gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in COVID-19. Patients and methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies reporting clinical data about COVID-19 patients, published until 25th March 2020. The primary endpoint was the pooled prevalence of COVID-19 patients complaining of GI symptoms. Secondary endpoints were the pooled prevalence of cases with COVID-19 positive stool samples, and of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. We used random-effects model for meta-analysis. Results Thirty-three studies were included in the meta-analysis. Out of 4434 COVID-19 patients, the pooled prevalence of GI manifestations was 11.51% (95% CI : 8.16 to 15.35). The most frequent GI symptom was diarrhea (7.78% of cases ; 95% CI : 5.05 to 11.04), followed by nausea/vomiting (3.57% ; 95% CI : 1.87 to 5.80), poor appetite (2.39% ; 95%CI : 0.55 ; 5.46) and abdominal pain (0.78% ; 95% CI : 0.26 to 1.57). Positivity for COVID-19 in stool samples was observed in 41.50% (95% CI : 17.70 to 67.65) of cases. 11.85% (95% CI : 3.53 to 24.17) of COVID-19 patients remained asymptomatic. Conclusions The present meta-analysis shows that a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients suffer from GI manifestations, as well as COVID-19 positivity in stool samples. Asymptomatic patients need to be considered a further potential route of viral transmission.","Merola, E; Armelao, F; de Pretis, G",Acta gastro-enterologica Belgica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33321018/,585

The biology of these RNA viruses is complex and poorly understood. KNOWN PATHOGENS: Coronaviruses are known pathogens in veterinary medicine, causing disease states in several domestic species. In human medicine, they can cause benign respiratory infections, but few laboratories include coronaviruses in their routine diagnostic tests. SUSPECTED PATHOGENS: There is some data in the literature suggesting coronaviruses might be implicated in more severe diseases including multiple sclerosis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and lower respiratory tract infections, particularly in infants. IMPROVING DIAGNOSTIC METHODS: Due to the lack of reliable and sensitive diagnostic techniques, it is impossible to date to correctly assess the medical impact of these ubiquitous and endemic viruses. Molecular biology techniques enabling detection of human coronavirus infections should be applied to verifying the suspected implication of these viruses in diverse disease states.","Vabret, A; Brouard, J; Petitjean, J; Eugene-Ruellan, G; Freymuth, F",Presse medicale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9850702/,585

Rats were inoculated intranasally as follows: Group 1, sterile medium only; Group 2, sterile medium followed one week later by 150 TCID50 SDAV; Group 3, sterile medium followed by 10(5.7) colony forming units of M. pulmonis; Group 4, SDAV followed one week later by M. pulmonis; Group 5, M. pulmonis followed one week later by SDAV; Group 6, M. pulmonis followed two weeks later by SDAV. Six rats from each group were euthanized at one, two and three weeks after the final inoculation. In a separate experiment, six additional animals were inoculated in each of groups 3, 5 and 6 (n = 18) and were sampled at five weeks after they had received M. pulmonis. Bronchoalveolar lavage and quantitative lung mycoplasma cultures were conducted on two-thirds of the rats. Histopathological examination and scoring of lesion severity were performed on all animals. Based on the prevalence and extent of histopathological lesions, bronchoalveolar lavage cell numbers, neutrophil differential cell counts and the isolation of M. pulmonis, the most severe disease occurred in the groups that received both agents. There was no significant difference in lesion severity between the groups receiving both agents other than in those examined during the acute stages of SDAV infection. Based on these results, it is evident that SDAV enhances lower respiratory tract disease in Wistar rats whether exposure occurs at one week prior to or at various intervals following M. pulmonis infections.","Schunk, M K; Percy, D H; Rosendal, S",Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7704844/,585
200807,Corona (Covid - 19),2020,"The development of preventive or therapeutic recombinant vaccines and the generation of serodiagnostic assays for infectious diseases depend essentially on the availability of molecularly defined antigens. A major bottleneck for the identification of suitable target antigens for many pathogens is the isolation of sufficient amounts of material for subsequent genomic or proteomic screening. Applying a highly efficient expression cloning strategy to the human pathogens vaccinia virus (VV) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (CP), we demonstrate that sub-nanogram amounts of isolated nucleic acids can be utilized to determine comprehensive sets of immunodominant antigens. Remarkably, the approach not only confirmed the immunogenicity of previously reported antigens but also disclosed novel vaccine candidates conserved in orthopoxviruses, including antigenic envelope proteins and immunodominant CTL epitopes. Moreover, as illustrated for CP infection, we show that a panel of novel antigens can be readily selected from the initially discovered pool to build up pathogen-specific seroassays. The established approach is rapid, making it an attractive procedure for the comprehensive dissection of immunomes of known human pathogens and newly emerging infectious agents.","Sahin, Ugur; Türeci, Ozlem; Graf, Claudine; Meyer, Ralf G; Lennerz, Volker; Britten, Cedrik M; Dumrese, Claudia; Scandella, Elke; Wölfel, Thomas; Ludewig, Burkhard",European journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16541470/,585

At necropsy, a 7-cm-diameter, yellow-brown, firm, multilobulated tumor was identified in the liver. Microscopically, the mass consisted of neoplastic cells arranged in small, closely packed nests within a thin fibrovascular stroma. These cells were of medium sized and polygonal, with fine argyrophilic cytoplasmic granules. Nuclei were predominantly round with finely stippled chromatin and indistinct nucleoli. Mitotic figures were numerous. Immunohistochemically, most of the neoplastic cells were immunoreactive for chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and weakly labeled for synaptophysin. The tumor was negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin, and cytokeratins 5, 6, 8, and 17. Vascular emboli and intrahepatic micrometastasis were also identified with chromogranin A. All these features were consistent with a hepatic neuroendocrine carcinoma and emphasized the importance of using a panel of antibodies to diagnose such rare tumors.","Ferreira-Neves, Patricia; Lezmi, Stéphane; Lejeune, Typhaine; Rakotovao, Farasao; Dally, Claire; Fontaine, Jean-Jacques; Bernex, Florence; Cordonnier, Nathalie","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18182524/,585

201623,Optimal control of the COVID-19 pandemic: controlled sanitary deconfinement in Portugal,2021,"INTRODUCTION Traumatic spinal injury presents the potential for significant morbidity and mortality, and posterior fixation and fusion with bone grafts is a primary treatment for many vertebral fractures. While iliac crest autograft (ICBG) is considered the gold standard in bone grafting, this carries risks of morbidity at the donor site as well as prolonging surgery time. Bone graft substitutes (BGS) may provide a viable alternative to autograft but there is little published data concerning its use in trauma. Therefore, we conducted this retrospective review to evaluate the outcomes for fusion among patients who have received a BGS during posterolateral fusion (PLF) for vertebral trauma. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective, consecutive patient cohort. Over a six-month period, we identified 27 patients who had undergone PLF for spine trauma and in whom a BGS comprised of bovine-derived apatite was used. All patients had followed the standard of care. The postoperative plain film radiographs at three, six, 12, and (optionally) 24 months were independently assessed by an orthopedic surgeon who was not affiliated with the hospital. RESULTS We documented a radiographically observed fusion rate of 85% and a successful treatment rate of 92%. There were no adverse events related to the BGS. Patients who received a BGS with ICBG spent significantly longer in surgery than other patients. There were no adverse events related to the BGS. CONCLUSIONS The spondylodesis rate following surgery in which the BGS was used in PLF, whether alone, mixed with local bone, or mixed with ICBG is comparable to the rates that have been reported for iliac crest autograft in these indications. The data indicates that the BGS provides a useful adjunct in PLF for the treatment of traumatic spine vertebral injuries. The use of BGS also allows for shorter time in surgery, which may reduce resource utilization and thus lower the total costs of the procedure. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Posterolateral fusion can be obtained with the use of a bio-derived BGS while reducing the time in surgery by avoiding the second procedure necessary to harvest ICBG. This may be advantageous in cases where the surgeon wishes to minimize operating time or when the availability of autograft is limited.","Weber, Sabrina; Acklin, Yves Pascal; Jenni, Raphael; Bereiter, Heinz; Broger, Ivan",Surgical technology international,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894518/,585

201911,Differential Ventilation Using Flow Control Valves as a Potential Bridge to Full Ventilatory Support during the COVID-19 Crisis,2020,"A novel method was developed to assemble a full-length infectious cDNA of the group II coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59). Seven contiguous cDNA clones that spanned the 31.5-kb MHV genome were isolated. The ends of the cDNAs were engineered with unique junctions and assembled with only the adjacent cDNA subclones, resulting in an intact MHV-A59 cDNA construct of approximately 31.5 kb in length. The interconnecting restriction site junctions that are located at the ends of each cDNA are systematically removed during the assembly of the complete full-length cDNA product, allowing reassembly without the introduction of nucleotide changes. RNA transcripts derived from the full-length MHV-A59 construct were infectious, although transfection frequencies were enhanced 10- to 15-fold in the presence of transcripts encoding the nucleocapsid protein N. Plaque-purified virus derived from the infectious construct replicated efficiently and displayed similar growth kinetics, plaque morphology, and cytopathology in murine cells as did wild-type MHV-A59. Molecularly cloned viruses recognized the MHV receptor (MHVR) for docking and entry, and pretreatment of cells with monoclonal antibodies against MHVR blocked virus entry and replication. Cells infected with molecularly cloned MHV-A59 virus expressed replicase (gene 1) proteins identical to those of laboratory MHV-A59. Importantly, the molecularly cloned viruses contained three marker mutations that had been derived from the engineered component clones. Full-length infectious constructs of MHV-A59 will permit genetic modifications of the entire coronavirus genome, particularly in the replicase gene. The method has the potential to be used to construct viral, microbial, or eukaryotic genomes approaching several million base pairs in length and used to insert restriction sites at any given nucleotide in a microbial genome.","Yount, Boyd; Denison, Mark R; Weiss, Susan R; Baric, Ralph S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12368349/,585

202509,Editor's presentation: Overweight carries a higher risk for developing heart failure in young women,2020,"Several studies have described unusually high incidence of vascular thrombosis in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients. Pathogenesis of the vascular thrombosis in COVID-19 is least understood for now and presents a challenge to the treating physicians. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen for COVID-19, has been shown to bind to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein in human epithelial cells which facilitates its entry in the organ and mediate tissue specific pathogenesis. For ACE2 mediated cell entry of the SARS-CoV-2, co-expression of one more protein-Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential. Existing studies suggested significant expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in human vascular endothelium. Vascular endothelial dysfunction can potentially activate coagulation cascade eventually resulting in thrombosis. ACE2 has proven role in the maintenance of endothelial integrity inside the vessels. Existing in situ evidence for SARS-CoV-1 (the causative agent for SARS pandemic of 2002, which shared ACE2 as cell entry receptor) suggested that virus binding can downregulate ACE2, thus can induce endothelial dysfunction. Recently, in situ evidence has been presented that SARS-CoV-2 can infect cells in engineered human vascular endothelium, which can be effectively blocked by using clinical-grade recombinant human ACE2. Based on the circumstantial evidence present in the literature, we propose a SARS-CoV-2 cell entry receptor ACE2 based mechanism for vascular thrombosis in COVID-19 patients.","Kumar, Ashutosh; Narayan, Ravi K; Kumari, Chiman; Faiq, Muneeb A; Kulandhasamy, Maheswari; Kant, Kamla; Pareek, Vikas",Med Hypotheses,,585
202704,Experience of reprofiling the reception department of a multi-disciplinary hospital under the conditions of the COVID-19 epidemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic introduced unparalleled uncertainty into the lives of pregnant women, including concerns about where it is the safest to give birth, while preserving their rights and wishes. Reports on the increased interest in community births (at home or in birth centers) are emerging. The purpose of this project was to quantitatively investigate psychological factors related to this birth preference. METHODS: This study included 3896 pregnant women from the COVID-19 Pregnancy Experiences (COPE) Study who were anticipating a vaginal birth. COPE Study participants were recruited online between April 24 and May 15, 2020, and completed a questionnaire that included preference with respect to place of birth and psychological constructs: fear of childbirth, basic beliefs about birth, pandemic-related preparedness stress, and pandemic-related perinatal infection stress. RESULTS: Women who preferred a community birth, on average, had less childbirth fear, had stronger beliefs that birth is a natural process, were less likely to see birth as a medical process, and were less stressed about being unprepared for birth and being infected with COVID-19. In multivariate models, higher stress about perinatal COVID-19 infection was associated with greater likelihood of preferring a community birth. The effect of perinatal infection stress on preference was stronger when preparedness stress was high. DISCUSSION: Women's birth preferences during the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with psychological processes related to risk perception. Community births are more appealing to women who view being in a hospital as hazardous because of the pandemic. Policies and prenatal care aimed to increase access to safe in-hospital and out-of-hospital birth services should be encouraged.","Preis, Heidi; Mahaffey, Brittain; Lobel, Marci",Birth,,585
202811,Authors from All Over the World Share Their Tech in HardwareX to Battle COVID-19,2021,"While anti-inflammatory properties of isocoumarins are known their PDE4 inhibitory potential was not explored previously. In our effort the non-PDE4 inhibitor isocoumarins were transformed into the promising inhibitors via introducing an aminosulfonyl/aminocarboxamide moiety to the C-3 benzene ring attached to the isocoumarin framework. This new class of isocoumarins were synthesized via a PdCl2-catalyzed construction of the 4-allyl substituted 3-aryl isocoumarin ring starting from the appropriate 2-alkynyl benzamide derivative. Several compounds showed good inhibition of PDE4B in vitro and the SAR indicated superiority of aminosulfonamide moiety over aminocarboxamide in terms of PDE4B inhibition. Two compounds 3q and 3u with PDE4B IC50 = 0.43 ± 0.11 and 0.54 ± 0.19 µM and &#8805; 2-fold selectivity over PDE4D emerged as initial hits. The participation of aminosulfonamide moiety in PDE4B inhibition and the reason for selectivity though moderate shown by 3q and 3u was revealed by the in silico docking studies. In view of potential usefulness of moderately selective PDE4B inhibitors the compound 3u (that showed PDE4 selectivity over other PDEs) was further evaluated in adjuvant induced arthritic rats. At an intraperitoneal dose of 30 mg/kg the compound showed a significant reduction in paw swelling (in a dose dependent manner), inflammation and pannus formation (in the knee joints) as well as pro-inflammatory gene expression/mRNA levels and increase in body weight. Moreover, besides its TNF-&#945; inhibition and no significant toxicity in an MTT assay the compound did not show any adverse effects in a thorough toxicity studies e.g. teratogenicity, hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity and apoptosis in zebrafish. Thus, the isocoumarin 3u emerged as a new, safe and moderately selective PDE4B inhibitor could be useful for inflammatory diseases possibly including COVID-19.","Thirupataiah, B; Mounika, Guntipally; Reddy, Gangireddy Sujeevan; Kumar, Jetta Sandeep; Hossain, Kazi Amirul; Medishetti, Raghavender; Samarpita, Snigdha; Rasool, Mahaboobkhan; Mudgal, Jayesh; Mathew, Jessy E; Shenoy, Gautham G; Rao, C Mallikarjuna; Chatti, Kiranam; Parsa, Kishore V L; Pal, Manojit",Eur J Med Chem,,585
202914,COVID-19: síndrome febril y clínica neurológica en neonato./ [COVID-19: Fever syndrome and neurological symptoms in a neonate],2020,"BACKGROUND: EAACI guidelines emphasise the importance of patient history in diagnosing food allergy (FA), and the need for studies investigating its value, using standardised allergy-focused questionnaires. OBJECTIVE: To determine the contribution of reaction characteristics, allergic comorbidities, and demographics, in predicting FA in individuals experiencing food-related adverse reactions. METHODS: Adult and school-age participants in the standardised EuroPrevall population surveys, with self-reported FA, were included. Penalised multivariable regression was used to assess the association of patient history determinants with 'probable' FA, defined as a food-specific case history supported by relevant IgE sensitisation. RESULTS: In adults (N=844), reproducibility of reaction (OR 1.35 [95% CI 1.29-1.41]), oral allergy symptoms (OAS) (4.46 [4.19-4.75]), allergic rhinitis (AR) comorbidity (2.82 [2.68-2.95]), asthma comorbidity (1.38 [1.30-1.46]), and male sex (1.50 [1.41-1.59]), were positively associated with probable FA. Gastrointestinal symptoms (0.88 [0.85-0.91]) made probable FA less likely. The AUC of a model combining all selected predictors was 0.85 after cross-validation. In children (N=670), OAS (2.26 [2.09-2.44]) and AR comorbidity (1.47 [CI 1.39-1.55]) contributed most to prediction of probable FA, with a combined cross-validation-based AUC of 0.73. When focusing on plant foods, the dominant source of FA in adults, the paediatric model also included gastrointestinal symptoms (inverse association), and the AUC increased to 0.81. CONCLUSIONS: In both adults and school-age children from the general population, reporting of OAS, and AR comorbidity, appear to be the strongest predictors of probable FA. Patient history particularly allows for good discrimination between presence and absence of probable plant FA.","Lyons, Sarah A; Knulst, André C; Burney, Peter G J; Fernandez-Rivas, Montserrat; Ballmer-Weber, Barbara K; Barreales, Laura; Bieli, Christian; Clausen, Michael; Dubakiene, Ruta; Fernandez-Perez, Cristina; Jedrzejczak-Czechowicz, Monika; Kowalski, Marek L; Kummeling, Ischa; Kralimarkova, Tanya; Mustakov, Tihomir B; van Os-Medendorp, Harmieke; Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G; Popov, Todor A; Potts, James; Versteeg, Serge A; Xepapadaki, Paraskevi; Welsing, Paco M J; Mills, E N Clare; van Ree, Ronald; Le, Thuy-My",Allergy,,585

203251,The Moderation Effect of Generation on the Relationship between Psychological Flexibility and COVID-19 Preventive Behaviour among Females,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 is a pandemic viral infection with a high morbidity rate, leading to many world-wide deaths since the end of 2019. The RBD (Receptor Binding Domain) of SARS-CoV-2 through its spike utilizes several host molecules to enter host cells. One of the most important ones is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme normally engaged in renin angiotensin pathway and is responsible for hypertension regulation. As different articles have analyzed separate compounds which can bind ACE2 as the potential virus entry blockers, and each one with a different molecular docking algorithm, in this study we compared all candidate compounds individually as well as their combinations using a unique validated software to introduce most promising ones. Methods: We collected and prepared a list of all available compounds which potentially can inhibit RBD binding site of the ACE2 from different studies and then reanalyzed and compared them using the Patchdock (ver. 1.3) as a suitable molecular docking algorithm for analysis of separate compounds or their combinations. Results: Saikosaponin A (e.g. in Bupleurum chinense), Baicalin (e.g. in several species in the genus Scutellaria), Glycyrrhizin (Glycyrrhiza glabra), MLN-4760 and Umifenovir better occupied ACE2 to inhibit viral RBD binding and are suggested as the top five inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 binding site of ACE2. Their combinatory effects were also inspiring concurrent ACE2 blockade. Conclusion: The results propose greatest compounds and their combinatory anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in order to decrease the time and expenses required for further experimental designs.","Shakhsi-Niaei, M.; Soureshjani, E.

It has caused infections in humans in China since 2013. Five waves of the H7N9 influenza epidemic occurred in China between March 2013 and September 2017. H7N9 with low-pathogenicity dominated in the first four waves, whereas highly pathogenic H7N9 influenza emerged in poultry and spread to humans during the fifth wave, causing wide concern. Specialists and officials from China and other countries responded quickly, controlled the epidemic well thus far, and characterized the virus by using new technologies and surveillance tools that were made possible by their preparedness efforts. Here, we review the characteristics of the H7N9 viruses that were identified while controlling the spread of the disease. It was summarized and discussed from the perspectives of molecular epidemiology, clinical features, virulence and pathogenesis, receptor binding, T-cell responses, monoclonal antibody development, vaccine development, and disease burden. These data provide tools for minimizing the future threat of H7N9 and other emerging and re-emerging viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2.","Liu, William J; Xiao, Haixia; Dai, Lianpan; Liu, Di; Chen, Jianjun; Qi, Xiaopeng; Bi, Yuhai; Shi, Yi; Gao, George F; Liu, Yingxia",Front.

Central to this are leukodystrophies, a group of progressive, neurogenetic disease affecting white matter pathology. In this review, we take a closer look at multiple leukodystrophies, classified based on the primary glial cell type that is affected. While white matter diseases involve oligodendrocyte and myelin loss, we discuss how astrocytes and microglia are affected and impinge on oligodendrocyte, myelin and axonal pathology. We provide an overview of the leukodystrophies covering their hallmark features, clinical phenotypes, diverse molecular pathways, and potential therapeutics for clinical trials. Glial cells are gaining momentum as cellular therapeutic targets for treatment of demyelinating diseases such as leukodystrophies, with no current treatment options. Here, we bring the much needed attention to role of glia in leukodystrophies, an integral step to furthering disease comprehension, understanding mechanisms and developing future therapeutics.","Garcia, Luis; Hacker, Julia L; Sase, Sunetra; Adang, Laura; Almad, Akshata",Neurobiol Dis,,585

A nationally representative, longitudinal survey of 2,490 Americans showed that prosocial concern had a larger positive influence on vaccination against influenza in sparser regions, as judged by a region's nonmetropolitan status, lesser population density, and lower proportion of urban land area. Two experiments (total n = 800), one preregistered, provide causal evidence that drawing attention to prosocial (vs. individual) concerns interacted with social density to affect vaccination intentions. Specifically, prosocial concern led to stronger intentions to vaccinate against influenza and COVID-19 but only when social density was low (vs. high). Moderated mediation analyses show that, in low-density conditions, the benefits of inducing prosocial concern were due to greater perceived impact of one's vaccination on others. In this light, public health communications may reap more benefits from emphasizing the prosocial aspects of vaccination in sparser environments.","Jung, Haesung; Albarracín, Dolores",Proc. Natl.

However, the differential impact of the pandemic and lockdown on groups of individuals, and the personal characteristics associated with poorer outcomes are unknown. METHOD: Data from 21 938 adults in England who participated in a stratified cohort study were analysed. Trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms were identified using growth mixture modelling. Multinomial and logistic regression models were constructed to identify sociodemographic and personality-related risk factors associated with trajectory class membership. RESULTS: Four trajectories of depression and five for anxiety were identified. The most common group presented with low symptom severity throughout, other classes were identified that showed: severe levels of symptoms which increased; moderate symptoms throughout; worsening mental health during lockdown but improvements after lockdown ended; and for anxiety only, severe initial anxiety that decreased quickly during lockdown. Age, gender, ethnicity, income, previous diagnoses, living situation, personality factors and sociability were associated with different trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 30% of participants experienced trajectories with symptoms in the clinical range during lockdown, and did not follow the average curve or majority group, highlighting the importance of differential trajectories. Young, female, outgoing and sociable people and essential workers experienced severe anxiety around the announcement of lockdown which rapidly decreased. Younger individuals with lower incomes and previous mental health diagnoses experienced higher and increasing levels of symptoms. Recognising the likely symptom trajectories for such groups may allow for targeted care or interventions.","Saunders, Rob; Buckman, Joshua E J; Fonagy, Peter; Fancourt, Daisy",Psychol Med,,585

However, there are controversies about whether preexisting chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury complication (AKI) are involved in the COVID-19 pandemic. MEASUREMENTS: Studies reported the kidney outcomes in different severity of COVID-19 were included in this study. Standardized mean differences or odds ratios were calculated by employing Review Manager meta-analysis software. RESULTS: Thirty-six trials were included in this systematic review with a total of 6395 COVID-19 patients. The overall effects indicated that preexisting CKD (OR = 3.28), complication of AKI (OR = 11.02), serum creatinine (SMD = 0.68), abnormal serum creatinine (OR = 4.86), blood urea nitrogen (SMD = 1.95), abnormal blood urea nitrogen (OR = 6.53), received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (OR = 23.63) were significantly increased in severe group than that in nonsevere group. Additionally, the complication of AKI (OR = 13.92) and blood urea nitrogen (SMD = 1.18) were remarkably elevated in the critical group than that in the severe group. CONCLUSIONS: CKD and AKI are susceptible to occur in patients with severe COVID-19. CRRT is applied frequently in severe COVID-19 patients than that in nonsevere COVID-19 patients. The risk of AKI is higher in the critical group than that in the severe group.","Liu, Ya-Fei; Zhang, Zhe; Pan, Xiao-Li; Xing, Guo-Lan; Zhang, Ying; Liu, Zhang-Suo; Tu, Sheng-Hao",PLoS One,,585

The predicted increase in the number of patients requiring hospitalisation prompted the need to increase the number of clinical staff working on hospital wards, particularly healthcare support workers (HCSWs), who play a crucial role in addressing the care needs of older people. This article describes how one health board in Scotland trained and redeployed volunteers among its staff to work as temporary HCSWs in its main hospital during the pandemic. A fast-track, one-day training course was delivered in March and April 2020 to 104 staff from various backgrounds - some non-clinical - by a team of volunteer trainers. Staffing during an emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, presents significant challenges, but the experience at NHS Borders shows that it is possible to develop a training course rapidly and provide additional band 2 staff to supplement the support workforce in a time of crisis.","Magowan, Rachel; Smith, Kim",Nurs. older people,,585

Because health care workers represent those on whom we are relying most for their resilience within our communities worldwide, and because of the complexities of their current situation, it is vital to bring more attention to their experiences and needs at this time. The pandemic can result in a deterioration of family support structures and stress recovery routines outside of work, causing a disruption to the balance of work and nonwork norms on which health care workers may have relied. [...]the work environment changes during the pandemic may cause some nurses to experience a stronger sense of fit than before the pandemic.

An ability to triage patients was needed due to a sudden and massive increase in patients during the COVID-19 pandemic as healthcare providers incurred an exponential increase in workload,which created a strain on the staff and limited resources. Further, methods to better understand and characterise the predictors of morbidity and mortality was needed. METHODS: We developed a prediction model to predict patients at risk for mortality using only laboratory, vital and demographic information readily available in the electronic health record on more than 3395 hospital admissions with COVID-19. Multiple methods were applied, and final model was selected based on performance. A variable importance algorithm was used for interpretability, and understanding of performance and predictors was applied to the best model. We built a model with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 83-97 to identify predictors and patients with high risk of mortality due to COVID-19. Oximetry, respirations, blood urea nitrogen, lymphocyte per cent, calcium, troponin and neutrophil percentage were important features, and key ranges were identified that contributed to a 50% increase in patients' mortality prediction score. With an increasing negative predictive value starting 0.90 after the second day of admission suggests we might be able to more confidently identify likely survivors DISCUSSION: This study serves as a use case of a machine learning methods with visualisations to aide clinicians with a better understanding of the model and predictors of mortality.

With the emergence of this threat, an unprecedented effort to develop vaccines against this virus began. As vaccines are now being introduced globally, we face the prospect of millions of people being vaccinated with multiple types of vaccines many of which use new vaccine platforms. Since medical events happen without vaccines, it will be important to know at what rate events occur in the background so that when adverse events are identified one has a frame of reference with which to compare the rates of these events so as to make an initial assessment as to whether there is a potential safety concern or not. Background rates vary over time, by geography, by sex, socioeconomic status and by age group. Here we describe two key steps for post-introduction safety evaluation of COVID-19 vaccines: Defining a dynamic list of Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) and establishing background rates for these AESI. We use multiple examples to illustrate use of rates and caveats for their use. In addition we discuss tools available from the Brighton Collaboration that facilitate case evaluation and understanding of AESI.","Black, Steven B; Law, Barbara; Chen, Robert T; Dekker, Cornelia L; Sturkenboom, Miriam; Huang, Wan-Ting; Gurwith, Marc; Poland, Greg",Vaccine,,585
210990,The many uncertainties of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Infectious disease emergencies are increasingly becoming part of the health care delivery landscape, having implications to not only individuals and the public, but also on those expected to respond to these emergencies. Health care workers (HCWs) are perhaps the most important asset in an infectious disease emergency, yet these individuals have their own barriers and facilitators to them being willing or able to respond. AIM: The purpose of this review was to identify factors affecting HCW willingness to respond (WTR) to duty during infectious disease outbreaks and/or bioterrorist events. METHODS: An integrative literature review methodology was utilized to conduct a structured search of the literature including CINAHL, Medline, Embase, and PubMed databases using key terms and phrases. PRISMA guidelines were used to report the search outcomes and all eligible literature was screened with those included in the final review collated and appraised using a quality assessment tool. RESULTS: A total of 149 papers were identified from the database search. Forty papers were relevant following screening, which highlighted facilitators of WTR to include: availability of personal protective equipment (PPE)/vaccine, level of training, professional ethics, family and personal safety, and worker support systems. A number of barriers were reported to prevent WTR for HCWs, such as: concern and perceived risk, interpersonal factors, job-level factors, and outbreak characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: By comprehensively identifying the facilitators and barriers to HCWs' WTR during infectious disease outbreaks and/or bioterrorist events, strategies can be identified and implemented to improve WTR and thus improve HCW and public safety.","Murray, Eleanor J; Mason, Matt; Sparke, Vanessa; Zimmerman, Peta-Anne P",Prehosp Disaster Med,,585

We claim that this is due to the inherent linear nature of convolution-based transformation, which is inadequate for handling severe restoration problems. Recently, a non-linear generalization of CNNs, called the operational neural networks (ONN), has been shown to outperform CNN on AWGN denoising. However, its formulation is burdened by a fixed collection of well-known nonlinear operators and an exhaustive search to find the best possible configuration for a given architecture, whose efficacy is further limited by a fixed output layer operator assignment. In this study, we leverage the Taylor series-based function approximation to propose a self-organizing variant of ONNs, Self-ONNs, for image restoration, which synthesizes novel nodal transformations onthe-fly as part of the learning process, thus eliminating the need for redundant training runs for operator search. In addition, it enables a finer level of operator heterogeneity by diversifying individual connections of the receptive fields and weights. We perform a series of extensive ablation experiments across three severe image restoration tasks. Even when a strict equivalence of learnable parameters is imposed, Self-ONNs surpass CNNs by a considerable margin across all problems, improving the generalization performance by up to 3 dB in terms of PSNR.","Malik, Junaid; Kiranyaz, Serkan; Gabbouj, Moncef",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.12894v1.pdf,585
211983,COVID-19 Global Pandemic: Options for Management of Gynecologic Cancers EDITORIAL COMMENT,2020,"The COVID-19 epidemic has caused a lack of data on highway transportation accidents involving dangerous goods in China in the first quarter of 2020, and this lack of data has seriously affected research on highway transportation accidents involving dangerous goods. This study strives to compensate for this lack to a certain extent and reduce the impact of missing data on research of dangerous goods transportation accidents. Data pertaining to 2340 dangerous goods accidents in the process of highway transportation in China from 2013 to 2019 are obtained with webpage crawling software. In this paper, the number of monthly highway transportation accidents involving dangerous goods from 2013 to 2019 is determined, and the time series of transportation accidents and an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) prediction model are established. The prediction accuracy of the model is evaluated based on the actual number of dangerous goods highway transportation accidents in China from 2017 to 2019. The results indicate that the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the actual and predicted values of dangerous goods highway transportation accidents from 2017 to 2019 is 0.147, 0.315 and 0.29. Therefore, the model meets the prediction accuracy requirements. Then, the prediction model is applied to predict the number of dangerous goods transportation accidents in the first quarter of 2020 in China. Twenty-two accidents are predicted in January, 23 accidents in February and 27 accidents in March. The results provide a reference for the study of dangerous goods transportation accidents and the formulation of accident prevention and emergency measures.","Li, Xiao Liu Yong Fan Lin-sheng Shi Shi-liang Zhang Tao Qi Ming-hui",Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries,,585
212286,Digitally-Delivered Mexican Theatre during the COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020,2021,"INTRODUCTION: A year into the pandemic, the knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection risks among healthcare workers remains limited. In this cross-sectional study, we examined whether healthcare workers with high exposure to Covid-19 patients had a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection than other healthcare workers in a Norwegian University Hospital. We also investigated the prevalence of asymptomatic healthcare workers in a ward with a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. METHODS: Healthcare workers from five wards at Akershus University Hospital were included between May 11 and June 11, 2020. Blood samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and seroprevalences compared between participants with high and low exposure to Covid-19 patients. Demographic data and SARS-CoV-2 infection risk factors were recorded in a questionnaire. Naso-/oropharyngeal swabs from participants from the outbreak ward were analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: 360/436 (82.6%) healthcare workers participated. 9/262 (3.4%) participants from wards with high exposure to Covid-19 patients were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive versus 3/98 (3.1%) from wards with low exposure (OR 1.13; 95%CI 0.3-4.26, p = .861). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were found in 11/263 (4.2%) participants who had worked one or more shifts caring for Covid-19 patients versus in 1/85 (1.2%) without any known occupational Covid-19 exposure (OR 3.67; 95%CI 0.46-29.06, p = .187). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in naso-/oropharyngeal swabs from 2/78 (2.6%) participants. CONCLUSION: We found no significantly increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers with high exposure to COVID-19 patients. Five healthcare workers had either serologic or molecular evidence of past or present unrecognized SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Handal, Nina; Whitworth, Jimmy; Blomfeldt, Anita; Espvik, Heidi Johanne; Lysaker, Elisabeth; Berdal, Jan Erik; Bakken Jørgensen, Silje",Infect Dis (Lond),,585

On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The caseload has increased exponentially, with WHO reporting 182 000 global cases by March 17, 2020, and over 2.6 million by 23 April. The clinical situation is complex, with children presenting different clinical features compared to adults. Several articles with recommendations on the anesthetic management of adult patients with COVID-19 have been published, but no specific recommendations for pediatric anesthesiologists have been made yet.

METHOD: cross-sectional survey conducted by telephone or mobile with 123 elderly individuals living by themselves in the Health Macro-Region of Triângulo Sul in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Descriptive analysis was performed along with bivariate and multiple linear regression (p<0.05). RESULTS: most elderly individuals did not present COVID-19 signs and symptoms (97.5%), were aware of how it is transmitted (86.6%), and of its signs and symptoms (90.8%). The elderly individuals were familiar with four preventive measures on average. After social distancing began, 85.7% of them left home and implemented three preventive measures on average, the most frequent of which was the use of face masks (99.0%). Being a man (p=0.001), 80 years old or older (p=0.045), and having fewer years of schooling (p=0.010) were associated with having less knowledge regarding the COVID-19 preventive measures. CONCLUSION: the elderly individuals were knowledgeable on COVID-19, but did not implement all the preventive measures. Male elderly individuals living by themselves with a low educational level are more vulnerable to COVID-19.","Tavares, Darlene Mara Dos Santos; Oliveira, Nayara Gomes Nunes; Marchiori, Gianna Fiori; Guimarães, Mariana Silva Freitas; Santana, Lenniara Pereira Mendes",Rev Lat Am Enfermagem,,585

213694,Combining Probabilistic Forecasts of COVID-19 Mortality in the United States,2021,"This study considered employee motivation in crisis situations with specific reference to the Covid-19 pandemic. A case study approach was adopted to investigate the employee motivation techniques implemented by a selected organization to ensure continued productivity. The case organization was selected following the convenience sampling technique and data was collected through telephone interviews with the human resource manager of the organization. Telephone interviews were appropriate following the restrictions implemented to prevent the spread of the virus. The results of the study indicate that the crisis situation required an adaptation of historical or old employee motivation techniques in order to suit the crisis situation. Employee motivation strategies such as employee recognition and goal setting took a changed direction involving both digitalization and significant decentralization. It was found that structural hierarchies had to be removed to effectively give autonomy to employees and empower them in order to remain productive. Following the evidence gathered in this study, organizations were recommended to be agile and be able to adapt all dimensions of employee productivity during crisis situations.","Mefi, Nteboheng Patricia Asoba Samson Nambei",Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal,,585
213704,Riding the COVID-19 curves - Perspectives on cases in India,2020,"During COVID-19, misinformation on social media affects the adoption of appropriate prevention behaviors. It is urgent to suppress the misinformation to prevent negative public health consequences. Although an array of studies has proposed misinformation suppression strategies, few have investigated the role of predominant credible information during crises. None has examined its effect quantitatively using longitudinal social media data. Therefore, this research investigates the temporal correlations between credible information and misinformation, and whether predominant credible information can suppress misinformation for two prevention measures (i.e. topics), i.e. wearing masks and social distancing using tweets collected from February 15 to June 30, 2020. We trained Support Vector Machine classifiers to retrieve relevant tweets and classify tweets containing credible information and misinformation for each topic. Based on cross-correlation analyses of credible and misinformation time series for both topics, we find that the previously predominant credible information can lead to the decrease of misinformation (i.e. suppression) with a time lag. The research findings provide empirical evidence for suppressing misinformation with credible information in complex online environments and suggest practical strategies for future information management during crises and emergencies.","Wang, Yan; Gao, Shangde; Gao, Wenyu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00976v1.pdf,585
213738,The COVID-19 Social Monitor longitudinal online panel: Real-time monitoring of social and public health consequences of the COVID-19 emergency in Switzerland,2020,"BACKGROUND: Current understanding of the carbon cycle in methanogenic environments involves trophic interactions such as interspecies H2 transfer between organotrophs and methanogens. However, many metabolic processes are thermodynamically sensitive to H2 accumulation and can be inhibited by H2 produced from co-occurring metabolisms. Strategies for driving thermodynamically competing metabolisms in methanogenic environments remain unexplored. RESULTS: To uncover how anaerobes combat this H2 conflict in situ, we employ metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to revisit a model ecosystem that has inspired many foundational discoveries in anaerobic ecology-methanogenic bioreactors. Through analysis of 17 anaerobic digesters, we recovered 1343 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes and corresponding gene expression profiles for uncultured lineages spanning 66 phyla and reconstructed their metabolic capacities. We discovered that diverse uncultured populations can drive H2-sensitive metabolisms through (i) metabolic coupling with concurrent H2-tolerant catabolism, (ii) forgoing H2 generation in favor of interspecies transfer of formate and electrons (cytochrome- and pili-mediated) to avoid thermodynamic conflict, and (iii) integration of low-concentration O2 metabolism as an ancillary thermodynamics-enhancing electron sink. Archaeal populations support these processes through unique methanogenic metabolisms-highly favorable H2 oxidation driven by methyl-reducing methanogenesis and tripartite uptake of formate, electrons, and acetate. CONCLUSION: Integration of omics and eco-thermodynamics revealed overlooked behavior and interactions of uncultured organisms, including coupling favorable and unfavorable metabolisms, shifting from H2 to formate transfer, respiring low-concentration O2, performing direct interspecies electron transfer, and interacting with high H2-affinity methanogenesis. These findings shed light on how microorganisms overcome a critical obstacle in methanogenic carbon cycles we had hitherto disregarded and provide foundational insight into anaerobic microbial ecology.

This discordance illustrates the need for a more unifying explanation as to whether SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly affects erythropoiesis. Here, we show significantly enriched CD71+ erythroid precursors/progenitors in the blood circulation of COVID-19 patients. We found that these cells have distinctive immunosuppressive properties. In agreement, we observed a strong negative correlation between the frequency of these cells with T and B cell proportions in COVID-19 patients. The expansion of these CD71+ erythroid precursors/progenitors was negatively correlated with the hemoglobin levels. A subpopulation of abundant erythroid cells, CD45+ CD71+ cells, co-express ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147, and CD26, and these can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In turn, pre-treatment of erythroid cells with dexamethasone significantly diminished ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression and subsequently reduced their infectivity with SARS-CoV-2. This provides a novel insight into the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on erythropoiesis and hypoxia seen in COVID-19 patients.","Shahbaz, Shima; Xu, Lai; Osman, Mohammed; Sligl, Wendy; Shields, Justin; Joyce, Michael; Tyrrell, D Lorne; Oyegbami, Olaide; Elahi, Shokrollah",Stem Cell Reports,,585

216597,A conversation on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on academic careers with junior researchers,2021,"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is triggered by a variety of agents, including Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB). Interestingly, a significant proportion of patients with COVID-19, also develop ARDS. In the absence of effective treatments, ARDS results in almost 40% mortality. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that resveratrol (RES), a stilbenoid, with potent anti-inflammatory properties can attenuate SEB-induced ARDS. In the current study, we investigated the role of RES-induced alterations in the gut and lung microbiota in the regulation of ARDS. Our studies revealed that SEB administration induced inflammatory cytokines, ARDS, and 100% mortality in C3H/HeJ mice. Additionally, SEB caused a significant increase in pathogenic Proteobacteria phylum and Propionibacterium acnes species in the lungs. In contrast, RES treatment attenuated SEB-mediated ARDS and mortality in mice, and significantly increased probiotic Actinobacteria phylum, Tenericutes phylum, and Lactobacillus reuteri species in both the colon and lungs. Colonic Microbiota Transplantation (CMT) from SEB-injected mice that were treated with RES as well as the transfer of L. reuteri into recipient mice inhibited the production of SEB-mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-Î³ and IL-17 but increased that of anti-inflammatory IL-10. Additionally, such CMT and L. reuteri recipient mice exposed to SEB, showed a decrease in lung-infiltrating mononuclear cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, NKT cells, Th1 cells, and Th17 cells, but an increase in the population of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Th3 cells, and increase in the survival of mice from SEB-mediated ARDS. Together, the current study demonstrates that ARDS induced by SEB triggers dysbiosis in the lungs and gut and that attenuation of ARDS by RES may be mediated, at least in part, by alterations in microbiota in the lungs and the gut, especially through the induction of beneficial bacteria such as L. reuteri.","Alghetaa, Hasan; Mohammed, Amira; Zhou, Juhua; Singh, Narendra; Nagarkatti, Mitzi; Nagarkatti, Prakash",Pharmacol Res,,585

Here, metabolomic analysis of blood, urine, and nasopharyngeal swabs from a group of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, and metagenomic analysis of pharyngeal samples were used to identify the key features of COVID-19. Results showed lactic acid, l-proline, and chlorogenic acid methyl ester (CME) were significantly reduced in the sera of COVID-19 patients compared with non-COVID-19 ones. Nasopharyngeal commensal bacteria including Gemella morbillorum, Gemella haemolysans and Leptotrichia hofstadii were notably depleted in the pharynges of COVID-19 patients, while Prevotella histicola, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Veillonella dispar were relatively increased. The abundance of G. haemolysans and L. hofstadii were significantly positively associated with serum CME, which might be an anti-SARS-CoV-2 bacterial metabolite.

The aims of our study were to investigate the changes of parameters (ALT, AST) in LI and determine the risk factors for LI in a cohort of 830 COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Demographic information, clinical features, and laboratory testing outcomes on admission were compared between patients with and without liver biochemistry abnormality (LBA). The same comparisons were performed between the LBA and LI groups. The updated RUCAM was used to determine the causality between drugs application and LI. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to explore the potential risk factors associated with LBA and LI. RESULTS: A total of 227 (27.3%) patients exhibited LBA and 32 (3.9%) patients were categorized as having LI based on the diagnostic criteria. 32.6% (74/227) of the LBA patients had RUCAM score >3, whereas the non-LBA patients had a slight lower at rate of 24.2% (146/603) (P = 0.047). Multivariable regression showed that a higher incidence of LBA was associated with hepatic hypoattenuation on computed tomography (CT) (odds ratio: 2.243, 95% confidence interval: 1.410-3.592, p = 0.001), lymphocyte proportion < 20% (2.088, 1.476-2.954, p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) > 1 mg/dL (2.650, 1.845-3.806, p < 0.001) and aspartate transaminase to alanine transaminase (AST/ALT) ratio > 1 (2.558, 1.820-3.596, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CRP levels > 1.0 mg/dL, lymphocyte proportion < 20%, AST/ALT ratio < 1, and triglyceride levels > 1.7 mol/L are potential risk factors for LI.","Chen, Faxiang; Chen, Wei; Chen, Jianpu; Xu, Dan; Xie, Wei; Wang, Xiang; Xie, Yuanliang",Ann. hepatol,,585

Besides endothelial cells, thrombin and platelets, also neutrophil granulocytes appear to play an important role. Neutrophils extrude extracellular nets which are histone- and protease-coated web-like DNA structures, activate coagulation and platelets, and release radicals and proteases such as elastase. The unique phylogenetically ancient and ""versatile"" inhibitor &#945;2 -M contributes particularly during childhood to the antithrombin activity of plasma, binds a broad spectrum of proteases and interacts with other mediators of inflammation such as cytokines.

This decision problem is closely related to the problem of optimal sensor selection, which is a very active research subject in control engineering. The goal of this paper is to propose a policy to smartly select the individuals to be tested. The main idea is to model the epidemics as a stochastic dynamic system and to select the individual to be tested accordingly to some optimality criteria, e.g. to minimize the probability of undetected asymptomatic cases. Every day, the probability of infection of the different individuals is updated making use of the stochastic model of the phenomenon and of the information collected in the previous days. Simulations for a closed community of 10'000 individuals show that the proposed technique, coupled with a selective confinement policy, can reduce the spread of the disease while limiting the number of individuals confined if compared to the simple contact tracing of positive and to an off-line test selection strategy based on the number of contacts.","Pezzutto, Matthias; Bono Rosselló, Nicolás; Schenato, Luca; Garone, Emanuele",Annual reviews in control,,585

Many reports have enough evidence for the use of FDA-approved drugs which have inhibitory potential against target proteins of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we utilized a structure-based drug design approach to find possible drug candidates from the existing pool of FDA-approved drugs and checked their effectiveness against the SARS-CoV-2. We performed virtual screening of the FDA-approved drugs against the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, an essential enzyme, and a potential drug target. Using well-defined computational methods, we identified Glecaprevir and Maraviroc (MVC) as the best inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Both drugs bind to the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and form a significant number of non-covalent interactions. Glecaprevir and MVC bind to the conserved residues of substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. This work provides sufficient evidence for the use of Glecaprevir and MVC for the therapeutic management of COVID-19 after experimental validation and clinical manifestations.","Shamsi, Anas; Mohammad, Taj; Anwar, Saleha; AlAjmi, Mohamed F; Hussain, Afzal; Rehman, Md Tabish; Islam, Asimul; Hassan, Md Imtaiyaz",Biosci. rep,,585

219172,Covid-19: Campaigner calls for national guidance to stop DNR orders being made without discussion with patients and families,2020,"PURPOSE: Gastric cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide and the second most common cause for cancer associated mortality. Anti-tumor effects of tamoxifen in breast cancer are well-established. However, no study has so far investigated the effects of tamoxifen on gene expression of Notch1 and DLL1 in gastric cancer cell line. The present study was conducted to explore the effects of tamoxifen, as a repurposed drug, on gene expression of Notch1 and DLL1 in MKN-45, a gastric cancer cell line. METHODS: MKN-45 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% FBS. Cytotoxic effects of tamoxifen on these cells at various concentrations were evaluated by trypan blue exclusion assay. For gene expression analysis, the cells were first incubated with 100 µM tamoxifen followed by total RNA extraction from treated and control cells. Then, cDNA was synthesized. Quantitative real-time PCR using specific primers for Notch1 and DLL1 was performed to assess the effect of tamoxifen on the transcript of them. RESULTS: Treatment with tamoxifen decreased viability of MKN-45 cells in a dose-dependent manner. CC50 was estimated to be around 200 µM. Also, tamoxifen at the dose of 100 µM could significantly downregulate mRNA levels of both Notch1 and DLL1 genes as compared with untreated cells by 24% and 92%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, tamoxifen interferes with Notch signaling pathway through downregulating the expression of Notch1 and DLL1 genes and this could be regarded as a mechanism for its anti-cancer effects in this malignant disease.","Khanipouyani, Faranak; Akrami, Hassan",,,585

Losartan is the ARB that was chosen to be tested in this study. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 and mild hypoxia (receipt of &#8804; 3 L/min O2 by nasal cannula) admitted to three hospitals were randomized in a 1:1 ratio within 72 h of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing confirmation to prospectively receive standard of care (SOC) alone or SOC plus losartan 12.5 mg orally every 12 h for 10 days or until hospital discharge, with the option to titrate upward dependent on blood pressure tolerability. Primary composite endpoint was receipt of mechanical ventilation or death before receiving ventilation. Subjects were followed until discharge to home or until an endpoint was met in the hospital. RESULTS: Sixteen subjects received an ARB plus SOC and 15 subjects received SOC alone. The median age was 53 years for both groups. Median time from hospital admission to study enrollment was 2 days (range 1-6) for the ARB group and 2 days (range 1-4) for the SOC group. Mean Charlson comorbidity index was 2 for both groups. One subject in each group achieved the composite endpoint. CONCLUSION: This small prospective randomized open-label study showed no clinically significant impacts of ARB therapy in mildly hypoxemic patients hospitalized with COVID-19 early in the pandemic. A larger prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial would be needed to confirm these findings or capture less pronounced effects and probably should focus on outpatients earlier in disease course.

Although a real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test has been used as a primary diagnostic tool for COVID-19, the utility of CT based diagnostic tools have been suggested to improve the diagnostic accuracy and reliability. Herein we propose a semi-supervised deep neural network for an improved detection of COVID-19. The proposed method utilizes CT images in a supervised and unsupervised manner to improve the accuracy and robustness of COVID-19 diagnosis. Both labeled and unlabeled CT images are employed. Labeled CT images are used for supervised leaning. Unlabeled CT images are utilized for unsupervised learning in a way that the feature representations are invariant to perturbations in CT images. To systematically evaluate the proposed method, two COVID-19 CT datasets and three public CT datasets with no COVID-19 CT images are employed. In distinguishing COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 CT images, the proposed method achieves an overall accuracy of 99.83%, sensitivity of 0.9286, specificity of 0.9832, and positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.9192. The results are consistent between the COVID-19 challenge dataset and the public CT datasets. For discriminating between COVID-19 and common pneumonia CT images, the proposed method obtains 97.32% accuracy, 0.9971 sensitivity, 0.9598 specificity, and 0.9326 PPV. Moreover, the comparative experiments with respect to supervised learning and training strategies demonstrate that the proposed method is able to improve the diagnostic accuracy and robustness without exhaustive labeling. The proposed semi-supervised method, exploiting both supervised and unsupervised learning, facilitates an accurate and reliable diagnosis for COVID-19, leading to an improved patient care and management.","Han, Chang Hee; Kim, Misuk; Kwak, Jin Tae",PLoS One,,585

Preliminary samples were collected from a hospital and a local municipal wastewater treatment plant. Molecular diagnostic methods were compared side by side to assess feasibility, performance, and sensitivity. Refined sample collection and processing protocols were then used to monitor two occupied dormitory complexes (n = 105 and 66) over 8 weeks. Wastewater results were validated using known case counts from external clinical testing of building occupants. Results confirm that ultracentrifugation from a 24-h composite collection had a sensitivity of 96.2% and a specificity of 100%. However, the method could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. If the detection of convalescent shedding is considered a false positive, then the sensitivity is 100% and specificity drops to 45%. It was determined that the proposed approach constitutes a highly sensitive wastewater surveillance method for detecting SARS-CoV-2, but it could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding. Future work must focus on approaches to distinguish new infections from convalescent shedding to fully realize the potential of building wastewater as a surveillance tool for congregate living. IMPORTANCE Some of the most severe outbreaks of COVID-19 have taken place in places where persons live together, such as nursing homes. Wastewater testing from individual buildings could be used for frequent pooled surveillance of virus from all occupants, including those who are contagious, with or without symptoms. This work provides a sensitive practical method for detecting infected individuals, as validated in two building complexes housing occupants who underwent frequent clinical testing performed by external entities. Although this sensitive method could be deployed now for pooled surveillance as an early warning system to limit outbreaks, the study shows that the approach will require further refinement to differentiate contagious, newly infected individuals from persons who have persistent viral fragments shedding in their stool outside the contagious period.","Colosi, Lisa M; Barry, Katie E; Kotay, Shireen M; Porter, Michael D; Poulter, Melinda D; Ratliff, Cameron; Simmons, William; Steinberg, Limor I; Wilson, D Derek; Morse, Rena; Zmick, Paul; Mathers, Amy J",Appl Environ Microbiol,,585

METHODS: A total of 649 Filipinos answered an online questionnaire, which contained 63 questions. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was utilized to derive the causal relationships of the latent variables construct. RESULTS: SEM showed that understanding of COVID-19 had significant direct effects on perceived vulnerability and perceived severity. Also, perceived vulnerability and perceived severity had significant indirect effects on intention to follow. Intention to follow had significant direct effects on actual behavior and adapted behavior, which subsequently led to perceived effectiveness. Of note, an understanding of COVID-19 was found to have a significant indirect effect on perceived effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The current study is one of the first studies to analyze factors affecting the perceived effectiveness of COVID-19 prevention measures during the global pandemic. It is proposed that the integrated PMT and extended TPB of this study can be applied and extended to evaluate the perceived effectiveness of COVID-19 measures in other countries that are currently dealing with COVID-19 pandemic.","Prasetyo, Yogi Tri; Castillo, Allysa Mae; Salonga, Louie John; Sia, John Allen; Seneta, Joshua Adam",Int J Infect Dis,,585

Design: Prospective, observational cohort study. Setting: Tertiary-care, academic medical center in Nashville, TN. Patients: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia and acute respiratory failure admitted to the adult ICU without venous thromboembolism at the time of ICU admission. Intervention: None. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was development of venous thromboembolism during the index hospitalization. Venous thromboembolism was defined by clinical imaging or autopsy, demonstrating deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Forty consecutive critically ill adults with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 were enrolled; 37 (92.5%) were hypercoagulable by at least one thromboelastography parameter at the time of ICU admission and 12 (30%) met the primary outcome of venous thromboembolism during the index hospitalization. Patients who developed venous thromboembolism had decreased measures of clotting (maximum amplitude, alpha angle, shear elastic modulus parameter, and clotting index) on ICU admission thromboelastography compared with patients who did not develop venous thromboembolism (p < 0.05 for all measures). For each individual thromboelastography parameter used to dichotomize patients as hypercoagulable, the rate of venous thromboembolism was not higher in those identified as hypercoagulable; in fact, the venous thromboembolism rate was higher in patients who were not hypercoagulable by thromboelastography for maximum amplitude (p = 0.04) and alpha angle (p = 0.001). Platelet count was positively correlated with maximum amplitude, alpha angle, G parameter, and clotting index, and significantly lower in patients who developed venous thromboembolism than those who did not (median 186 vs 278 103/µL, p = 0.046). Venous thromboembolism was associated with inhospital mortality (odds ratio, 6.3; 95% CI, 1.4-29; p = 0.02). Conclusions: Our data do not support the use of thromboelastography to risk stratify critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019 for the development of venous thromboembolism or to guide decisions about anticoagulation. Lower platelet count on ICU admission, which may reflect platelet aggregation, was associated with venous thromboembolism.","Marvi, Tanya K; Stubblefield, William B; Tillman, Benjamin F; Tenforde, Mark W; Feldstein, Leora R; Patel, Manish M; Self, Wesley H; Grijalva, Carlos G; Rice, Todd W",Crit Care Explor,,585
220893,Fair allocation of scarce medical resources during COVID-19 pandemic: ethical considerations,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The UK is one of the epicenters of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the world. As of April 14, there have been 93 873 confirmed patients of COVID-19 in the UK and 12 107 deaths with confirmed infection. On April 14, it was reported that COVID-19 was the cause of more than half of the deaths in London. METHODS: The present paper addresses the modeling and forecasting of the outbreak of COVID-19 in the UK. This modeling must be accomplished through a 2-part time series model to study the number of confirmed cases and deaths. The period we aimed at a forecast was 46 days from April 15 to May 30, 2020. All the computations and simulations were conducted on Matlab R2015b, and the average curves and confidence intervals were calculated based on 100 simulations of the fitted models. RESULTS: According to the obtained model, we expect that the cumulative number of confirmed cases will reach 282 000 with an 80% confidence interval (242 000 to 316 500) on May 30, from 93 873 on April 14. In addition, it is expected that, over this period, the number of daily new confirmed cases will fall to the interval 1330 to 6450 with the probability of 0.80 by the point estimation around 3100. Regarding death, our model establishes that the real case fatality rate of the pandemic in the UK approaches 11% (80% confidence interval: 8%-15%). Accordingly, we forecast that the total death in the UK will rise to 35 000 (28 000-50 000 with the probability of 80%). CONCLUSIONS: The drawback of this study is the shortage of observations. Also, to conduct a more exact study, it is possible to take the number of the tests into account as an explanatory variable besides time.","Jamshidi, Babak; Rezaei, Mansour; Kakavandi, Mohsen; Jamshidi Zargaran, Shahriar",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,585
220982,Couples Therapists' Attitudes Toward Online Therapy During the COVID-19 Crisis,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has high infectivity and causes extensive morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular disease is a risk factor for adverse outcomes in COVID-19, but baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in particular has not been evaluated thoroughly in this context. We analyzed patients in our state's largest health system who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 20 and May 15, 2020. Inclusion required an available echocardiogram within 1 year prior to diagnosis. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. LVEF was analyzed both as a continuous variable and using a cutoff of 40%. Among 396 patients (67 ± 16 years, 191 [48%] male, 235 [59%] Black, 59 [15%] LVEF &#8804;40%), 289 (73%) required hospital admission, and 116 (29%) died during 85 ± 63 days of follow-up. Echocardiograms, performed a median of 57 (IQR 11-122) days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis, showed a similar distribution of LVEF between survivors and decedents (P = 0.84). Receiver operator characteristic analysis revealed no predictive ability of LVEF for mortality, and there was no difference in survival among those with LVEF &#8804;40% versus >40% (P = 0.49). Multivariable analysis did not change these relationships. Similarly, there was no difference in LVEF based on whether the patient required hospital admission (56 ± 13 vs 55 ± 13, P = 0.38), and patients with a depressed LVEF did not require admission more frequently than their preserved-LVEF peers (P = 0.87). A premorbid history of dyspnea consistent with symptomatic heart failure was not associated with mortality (P = 0.74). Among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, pre-COVID-19 LVEF was not a risk factor for death or hospitalization.","Morin, Daniel P; Manzo, Marc A; Pantlin, Peter G; Verma, Rashmi; Bober, Robert M; Krim, Selim R; Lavie, Carl J; Qamruddin, Salima; Shah, Sangeeta; Tafur Soto, José D; Ventura, Hector; Price-Haywood, Eboni G",Curr Probl Cardiol,,585
221381,COVID-19 barriers and response strategies for refugees and undocumented migrants in Turkey,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To confirm an increase in the number of women with molar pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, all patients with complete or partial mole diagnosed at our institution between January 1, 2010 and October 31, 2020, were included. To verify whether there was an increase in the incidence of hydatidiform mole (HM) and deliveries in 2020, the incidences for each year from January 2010 to October 2020 were recorded. In addition, we identified all women who were diagnosed with HM from January to October 2020, and compared them with a control group who underwent uterine evacuation for missed abortion of a singleton pregnancy during the same period. We also documented the time taken to diagnose missed abortion or molar pregnancy to check if a delay in diagnosis can explain the increase in HM incidence. RESULTS: Between 2016 and 2019, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of molar pregnancy. A further increase occurred in 2020 (odds ratio = 2.071). The mean gestational age of the embryo at the time of diagnosis was smaller in the HM group than in the missed abortion group (6.3 ± 1.67-7.4 ± 2.4, one-sided P = 0.034), meaning that it took more time (days) to diagnose molar pregnancy than missed abortion (22.38 ± 10.32 vs. 15.83 ± 7.83 days, P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: There was a significant increase in the incidence of molar pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly because of the delay in receiving medical care. We recommend providing gynecological primary care services during a crisis, such as a pandemic.","Aiob, Ala; Naskovica, Karina; Sharon, Avishalom; Bornstein, Jacob",Gynecol Oncol,,585
221836,Examining boundaries to understand the impact of COVID-19 on vocational behaviors,2020,"The COVID-19 outbreak is an epidemic disease caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). When a new virus emerges, generally, little is known about it, and no vaccines or other pharmaceutical interventions are available. In the case of a person-to-person transmission virus with no vaccines or other pharmaceutical interventions, the only way to control the virus outbreak is by keeping a sustained physical distancing between the individuals. However, to adjust the level of the physical distancing accurately can be so complicated. Any level above the necessary can compromise the economic activity, and any level below can collapse the health care system. This work proposes a controller to keep the number of hospitalized individuals below a limit, and a new group-structured model to describe the COVID-19 outbreak. The proposed controller is robust to the uncertainties in the parameters of the model and keeps the number of infected individuals controlled only by adjusting the social distancing level. Numerical simulations, to show the behavior of the proposed controller and model, are done.","Dias, Samaherni; Queiroz, Kurios; Araujo, Aldayr",ISA Trans,,585

Participants who have been involved in tracheal intubations in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection were included anonymously after obtaining their informed consent. The primary outcome was the preferred airway device for tracheal intubation. Secondary outcomes included the variations in clinical practice including the preferred video laryngoscope, plans for difficult airway management, and personal protective equipment.RESULTSË 1125 physicians completed the questionnaire with a response rate of 40,9%. Most participants worked in public hospitals and were anesthesiologists.The preferred device for intubation was the video laryngoscope (5.1/6), with the type of device in decreasing order as follows: Glidescope, C-MAC, Airtraq, McGrath and King Vision. The most frequently used device for intubation was the video laryngoscope (70,5%), using them in descending order as follow: the Airtraq, C-MAC, Glidescope, McGrath and King Vision.Discomfort of intubating wearing personal protective equipment and the frequency of breaching a security step was statistically significant, increasing the risk of cross infection between patients and physicians. The opinion of senior doctors differed from younger physicians in the type of video-laryngoscope used, the number of experts involved in tracheal intubation and the reason that caused more stress during the airway management.CONCLUSIONSË Most physicians preferred using a video-laryngoscope with remote monitor and disposable Macintosh blade, using the Frova guide.","Gil, Manuel Granell",,,585
223006,"Leadership behaviour, team effectiveness, technological flexibility, work engagement and performance during COVID-19 lockdown: An exploratory study",2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused substantially more infections, deaths, and economic disruptions than the 2002-2003 SARS-CoV. The key to understanding SARS-CoV-2's higher infectivity lies partly in its host receptor recognition mechanism. Experiments show that the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, which serves as the primary receptor for both CoVs, binds to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of CoV-2's spike protein stronger than SARS-CoV's spike RBD. The molecular basis for this difference in binding affinity, however, remains unexplained from X-ray structures. To go beyond insights gained from X-ray structures and investigate the role of thermal fluctuations in structure, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Microseconds-long simulations reveal that while CoV and CoV-2 spike-ACE2 interfaces have similar conformational binding modes, CoV-2 spike interacts with ACE2 via a larger combinatorics of polar contacts, and on average, makes 45% more polar contacts. Correlation analysis and thermodynamic calculations indicate that these differences in the density and dynamics of polar contacts arise from differences in spatial arrangements of interfacial residues, and dynamical coupling between interfacial and non-interfacial residues. These results recommend that ongoing efforts to design spike-ACE2 peptide blockers will benefit from incorporating dynamical information as well as allosteric coupling effects.","Delgado, Julián M; Duro, Nalvi; Rogers, David M; Tkatchenko, Alexandre; Pandit, Sagar A; Varma, Sameer",Proteins,,585
223119,The Impact of Lockdown in England on Daily Confirmed Cases of COVID-19 and Related Deaths Compared to Sweden: A Comparative Interrupted Time Series Analysis,2020,"The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, spread worldwide after its emergence in China. Whether rich or poor, all nations are struggling to cope with this new global health crisis. The speed of the threat's emergence and the quick response required from public health authorities and the public itself makes evident the need for a major reform in pandemic surveillance and notification systems. The development and implementation of a graded, individual-level pandemic notification system could be an effective tool to combat future threats of epidemics. This paper describes a prototype model of such a notification system and its potential advantages and challenges for implementation. Similar to other emergency alerts, this system would include a number of threat levels (level 1-5) with a higher level indicating increasing severity and intensity of safety measures (eg, level 1: general hygiene, level 2: enhanced hygiene, level 3: physical distancing, level 4: shelter in place, and level 5: lockdown). The notifications would be transmitted to cellular devices via text message (for lower threat levels) or push notification (for higher threat levels). The notification system would allow the public to be informed about the threat level in real time and act accordingly in an organized manner. New Zealand and the United Kingdom have recently launched similar alert systems designed to coordinate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic response more efficiently. Implementing such a system, however, faces multiple challenges. Extensive preparation and coordination among all levels of government and relevant sectors are required. Additionally, such systems may be effective primarily in countries where there exists at least moderate trust in government. Advance and ongoing public education about the nature of the system and its steps would be an essential part of the system, such that all members of the public understand the meaning of each step in advance, similar to what has been established in systems for other emergency responses. This educational component is of utmost importance to minimize adverse public reaction and unintended consequences. The use of mass media and local communities could be considered where mobile phone penetration is low. The implementation of such a notification system would be more challenging in developing countries for several reasons, including inadequate technology, limited use of data plans, high population density, poverty, mistrust in government, and tendency to ignore or failure to understand the warning messages. Despite the challenges, an individual-level pandemic notification system could provide added benefits by giving an additional route for notification that would be complementary to existing platforms.","Sakib, Mohammad Nazmus; Butt, Zahid A; Morita, Plinio Pelegrini; Oremus, Mark; Fong, Geoffrey T; Hall, Peter A",J Med Internet Res,,585

We present a model combining 6 smartphone sensors, prioritising some of them when certain conditions are met. We empirically verified our approach in various realistic environments to demonstrate an achievement of up to 95% fewer false positives, and 62% more accurate than Bluetooth-only system.

Additionally, 18 guidelines about the COVID-19 were reviewed and the key points were represented in this study.Study selection The review included human trials, in-vitro studies, review articles, and credible news reports about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 complications, treatment guidelines, management strategies, and epidemiological features. There were no exclusion criteria reported in this review and the included information was in English and Chinese languages.Data extraction and synthesis A descriptive review of the literature was conducted, taking a comprehensive approach. The paper consisted of three main parts: introduction, presentation, and management. The introduction part presented basic information about the SARS-CoV-2, its evolution and transmission, and the course of disease. The presentation section introduced the signs and symptoms, diagnosis, high risk groups, and complications of COVID-19. Eventually, some evidence was presented about the prevention, medical management, and measuring responses to the treatments in the management section.Results Based on the results of this study, non-pharmaceutical interventions, including strict social isolation and distancing measures, might reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 by nearly 99.3 percent (reproduction number mitigating from 406 to 2.5 in 30 days). In the supportive management section, monitoring vital signs and neonatal feeding were stated as the most important factors to consider. For symptomatic neonates, medical management and intervention were mentioned as essential. It was claimed that for adults with mild infection, the best option would be home quarantine with further medical monitoring or hospitalisation if required. The following sequence was also suggested as early supportive therapy and monitoring: intravenous fluid administration, oxygen therapy, and application of corticosteroids. Management of critical patients with critical COVID-19 included admission to intensive care unit, use of continuous positive airway pressure and bi-level positive airway pressure in certain circumstances, endotracheal intubation, invasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. Additionally, this study suggested oseltamivir, iopinavir, remdesivir, chloroquine, baricitinib, ruxolitinib, and fedratinib as possible drugs to help manage COVID-19. A soaring c-reactive protein level and decreased albumin content in the blood were reported to be associated with a deteriorating status in COVID-19 patients. To keep the number of exposures to a minimum, two separate viral clearance tests taken at least 24 hours apart, were stated as necessary laboratory results before the discharge of patients with COVID-19.Conclusions The study warns about possible exponential spread of COVID-19 and proposes to adhering to tighter restrictions of social distancing. Besides the clinical guidelines presented within the study, it also encourages further up-to-date and evidence-based management guidelines for patients with COVID-19.","Shamsoddin, Erfan",Evid Based Dent,,585

(Research Theme: COVID-19 pandemic.),2020,"OBJECTIVE: Scientific research is an essential necessity for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Accelerated paper-sharing makes it possible to explore the responses of scientific communities of different countries and their research focus. This is achieved by examining relevant publications during the early stage of the pandemic. This paper explores a timely research assessment on COVID-19 among China, USA, and EU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Papers indexed in PubMed and published from December 30, 2019, to March 11, 2020, were selected. Papers from China, USA, and EU were assessed by calculating the significance of items in the co-occurrence exported from VOSviewer. RESULTS: The results showed that Chinese studies focus more on clinical manifestations, while USA and EU focus on experimental research. Furthermore, US research is more geared toward detection techniques and mathematical models, China focuses more on monitoring the epidemic situation, and EU engages in both. CONCLUSIONS: This paper argues that the above distinctions are caused by differences in the stages of epidemic development, researchers' experience bases for formulating measures, traditions within the different medical cultures, and the distinction between ""information"" and ""knowledge"".","Cheng, X; Zhou, M-T; Tang, L; Wang, G-Y",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,585

227513,COVID-19-nurses and midwives impact on global security,2020,"Chronic disease management models in primary care have demonstrated significant benefits to the patient experience and patient health outcomes. In trying to prepare for the future, with or without COVID-19 implications, dental providers and clinics are facing opportunities to add value, consider alternative payment models, and to incorporate risk stratification and population health management along with medical systems. However, as alternative payment models emerge in dentistry, stand-alone dental clinics may face unique challenges in trying to prepare for the future while still providing patient care in the fee for service environment. This article focuses on a 6-months pilot project of how implementing a comprehensive caries disease management care model, evaluating caries risk, and implementing risk stratification strategies can prepare dental offices for future payment models and inclusion in the greater health system. There are two overall goals for this pilot. First, applying a caries disease management protocol to every patient visit, regardless of reimbursement. Second, applying quality improvement (QI) principles to change how a dental office approaches care delivery. The Institute of Medicine defines quality in healthcare as a direct correlation between the level of improved health services and the desired health outcomes of individuals and populations.","Bruner, Tess",J Public Health Dent,,585

We also determined whether COVID-19 serologic testing of HCP decreased their self-reported anxiety. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study from May 13, 2020, to July 8, 2020, we used electronic surveys to capture participant self-reported symptoms before and after serologic testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G antibodies. Participants were physicians, nurses, advanced practice providers, and nonclinical ED personnel at 20 geographically diverse United States EDs. We evaluated these domains: 1) the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on overall stress and anxiety; 2) COVID-19-related work stressors; 3) burnout; and 4) PTSD risk (measured using the Primary Care-PTSD Screen for DSM-5, a 5-item screening instrument in which a score of &#8805;3 signifies high risk for PTSD). We also assessed perceptions of whether results of COVID-19 antibody testing decreased participants' self-reported anxiety. RESULTS: Of 1,606 participants, 100% and 88% responded to the baseline and follow-up surveys, respectively.

228589,"The UK Government’s Covid-19 Response and Article 2 of the ECHR (Title I Dignity;Right to Life, Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU)",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Rapid Point of Care Testing (POCT) for influenza could be used to provide information on influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) as well as influencing clinical decision-making in primary care. METHODS: We undertook a test negative case control study to estimate the overall and age-specific (6 months-17 years, 18-64 years, &#8805;65 years old) IVE against medically attended POCT-confirmed influenza. The study took place over the winter of 2019-2020 and was nested within twelve general practices that are part of the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC), the English sentinel surveillance network. RESULTS: 648 POCT were conducted. 193 (29.7%) of those who were swabbed had received the seasonal influenza vaccine. The crude unadjusted overall IVE was 46.1% (95% CI: 13.9-66.3). After adjusting for confounders the overall IVE was 26.0% (95% CI: 0-65.5). In total 211 patients were prescribed an antimicrobial after swab testing. Given a positive influenza POCT result, the odds ratio (OR) of receiving an antiviral was 21.1 (95%CI: 2.4-182.2, p = <0.01) and the OR of being prescribed an antibiotic was 0.6 (95%CI: 0.4-0.9, p = <0.01). DISCUSSION: Using influenza POCT in a primary care sentinel surveillance network to estimate IVE is feasible and provides comparable results to published IVE estimates. A further advantage is that near patient testing of influenza is associated with improvements in appropriate antiviral and antibiotic use. Larger, randomised studies are needed in primary care to see if these trends are still present and to explore their impact on outcomes.","de Lusignan, Simon; Hoang, Uy; Liyanage, Harshana; Tripathy, Manasa; Sherlock, Julian; Joy, Mark; Ferreira, Filipa; Diez-Domingo, Javier; Clark, Tristan",PLoS One,,585
228641,Algunas lecciones aprendidas (o no tanto) de la COVID-19./ [Some learned lessons (or not so much) from COVID-19],2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic causes significant strain on healthcare infrastructure and medical resources. So, it becomes crucial to identify reliable predictor biomarkers for COVID-19 disease severity and short term mortality. Many biomarkers are currently investigated for their prognostic role in COVID-19 patients. Our study is retrospective and aims to evaluate role of semi-quantitative CT-severity scoring versus LDH as prognostic biomarkers for COVID-19 disease severity and short-term clinical outcome. Results: Two hundred sixty-six patients between April 2020 and November 2020 with positive RT-PCR results underwent non-enhanced CT scan chest in our hospital and were retrospectively evaluated for CT severity scoring and serum LDH level measurement. Data were correlated with clinical disease severity. CT severity score and LDH were significantly higher in severe and critical cases compared to mild cases (P value &lt; 0.001). High predictive significance of CT severity score for COVID-19 disease course noted, with cut-off value ≥ 13 highly predictive of severe disease (96.96% accuracy);cut-off value ≥ 16 highly predictive of critical disease (94.21% accuracy);and cut-off value ≥ 19 highly predictive of short-term mortality (92.56% accuracy). CT severity score has higher sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values as well as overall accuracy compared to LDH level in predicting severe, critical cases, and short-term mortality. Conclusion: Semi-quantitative CT severity scoring has high predictive significance for COVID-19 disease severity and short-term mortality with higher sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy compared to LDH. Our study strongly supports the use of CT severity scoring as a powerful prognostic biomarker for COVID-19 disease severity and short-term clinical outcome to allow triage of need for hospital admission, earlier medical interference, and to effectively prioritize medical resources for cases with high mortality risk for better decision making and clinical outcome. © 2021, The Author(s).","Magdy, A.

229206,Soins continus et COVID-19 : Qu’une telle tragédie ne se reproduise plus au Canada!,2020,"BackgroundThe Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 has become predominant globally. We evaluated the transmission dynamics and epidemiological characteristics of the Delta variant in an outbreak in southern China. MethodsData on confirmed cases and their close contacts were retrospectively collected from the outbreak that occurred in Guangdong, China in May-June 2021. Key epidemiological parameters, temporal trend of viral loads and secondary attack rates were estimated and compared between the Delta variant and the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus. We also evaluated the association of vaccination with viral load and transmission. ResultsWe identified 167 patients infected with the Delta variant in the Guangdong outbreak. The mean estimates of the latent period and the incubation period were 4.0 days and 5.8 days, respectively. A relatively higher viral load was observed in Delta cases than in wild-type infections. The secondary attack rate among close contacts of Delta cases was 1.4%, and 73.9% (95% confidence interval: 67.2%, 81.3%) of the transmissions occurred before onset. Index cases without vaccination (OR: 2.84, 95% confidence interval: 1.19, 8.45) or with one dose of vaccination (OR: 6.02, 95% confidence interval: 2.45, 18.16) were more likely to transmit infection to their contacts than those who had received 2 doses of vaccination. DiscussionPatients infected with the Delta variant had more rapid symptom onset. The shorter and time-varying serial interval should be accounted in estimation of reproductive numbers. The higher viral load and higher risk of pre-symptomatic transmission indicated the challenges in control of infections with the Delta variant.","Kang, Min; Xin, Hualei; Yuan, Jun; Ali, Sheikh Taslim; Liang, Zimian; Zhang, Jiayi; Hu, Ting; Lau, Eric; Zhang, Yingtao; Zhang, Meng; Cowling, Benjamin J; Li, Yan; Wu, Peng",,,585

In this commentary, we discuss how this enormous challenge could be addressed for viral vector-based Covid-19 vaccines by learning from the wealth of formulation development experience gained over the years on stability issues related to live attenuated virus vaccines and viral vector vaccines for other diseases. This experience has led -over time- to major improvements on storage temperature, shelf-life and in-use stability requirements. First, we will cover work on 'classical' live attenuated virus vaccines as well as replication competent viral vector vaccines. Subsequently, we address replication deficient viral vector vaccines. Freeze drying and storage at 2-8 °C with a shelf life of years has become the norm. In the case of pandemics with incredibly high and urgent product demands, however, the desire for rapid and convenient distribution chains combined with short end-user storage times require that liquid formulations with shelf lives of months stored at 2-8 °C be considered. In confronting this ""perfect storm"" of Covid-19 vaccine stability challenges, understanding the many lessons learned from decades of development and manufacturing of live virus-based vaccines is the shortest path for finding promising and rapid solutions.","Crommelin, Daan J A; Volkin, David B; Hoogendoorn, Karin H; Lubiniecki, Anthony S; Jiskoot, Wim",J. pharm. sci,,585
229414,"A Comparative Study of COVID-19 Pandemic in Rajasthan, India",2021,"Since the outbreak emerged in November 2019, no effective drug has yet been found against SARS-CoV-2. Repositioning studies of existing drug molecules or candidates are gaining in overcoming COVID-19. Antiviral drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, and galidesivir act by inhibiting the vital RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2. The importance of in silico studies in repurposing drug research is gradually increasing during the COVID-19 process. The present study found that especially ribavirin triphosphate and galidesivir triphosphate active metabolites had a higher affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase than ATP by molecular docking. With the Molecular Dynamics simulation, we have observed that these compounds increase the complex's stability and validate the molecular docking results. We also explained that the interaction of RNA polymerase inhibitors with Mg++, which is in the structure of NSP12, is essential and necessary to interact with the RNA strand. In vitro and clinical studies on these two molecules need to be increased.","Celik, Ismail; Erol, Meryem; Duzgun, Zekeriya",Mol. divers,,585

The SADS-CoV genome shares ~95% identity to that of bat &#945;-coronavirus HKU2, suggesting that SADS-CoV may have emerged from a natural reservoir in bats. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 Å and 2.83 Å resolution, respectively. We systematically compare the domains of HKU2 spike with those of &#945;-, ß-, Î³-, and Î´-coronavirus spikes, showing that the S1 subunit N- and C-terminal domains of HKU2/SADS-CoV are ancestral domains in the evolution of coronavirus spike proteins. The connecting region after the fusion peptide in the S2 subunit of HKU2/SADS-CoV adopts a unique conformation. These results structurally demonstrate a close evolutionary relationship between HKU2/SADS-CoV and ß-coronavirus spikes and provide insights into the evolution and cross-species transmission of coronaviruses.","Yu, Jinfang; Qiao, Shuyuan; Guo, Runyu; Wang, Xinquan",Nat Commun,,585

Like the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also employs a receptor-binding motif (RBM) of its spike protein to bind a host receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), to gain entry. Currently, several mRNA or adenoviral vaccines encoding for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 are being used to boost antibodies capable of inhibiting spike-ACE2 interaction and viral entry. However, recent evidence has also suggested an anti-inflammatory effect of spike-reactive antibodies, suggesting that some SARS-CoV-2 spike-based vaccines may elicit protective antibodies capable of inhibiting GM-CSF production and COVID-19 progression.","Li, Jianhua; Wang, Ping; Tracey, Kevin J; Wang, Haichao",Mol Med,,585

We carried out a direct comparison of the analytical sensitivities of 14 conventional and three rapid RT-PCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The comparison was performed utilizing a certified reference material for SARS-CoV-2 RNA that was serially two-fold diluted in RNA storage solution. Our results show that the analytical sensitivities of the 17 assays varied within an 8-fold range (100-800 copies/mL). Moreover, a trend with some rapid assays yielding slightly higher analytical sensitivities (2- to 4-fold) compared with conventional assays was observed. We conclude that most of the RT-PCR assays can be used for routine COVID-19 diagnosis, but some assays with the poorest analytical sensitivities may lead to false-negative results when used to identify asymptomatic individuals who can carry a low viral load but still be infectious. These findings should be kept in mind when selecting high-sensitivity and rapid assays.","Wang, Xueliang; Huang, Zhongqiang; Song, Jian; Xiao, Yanqun; Wang, Hualiang",J Virol Methods,,585

SARS-CoV-2 is found in patients’ airways, including for asymptomatic ones. Available data suggest a underestimated risk of air transmission of SARS-CoV-2 when an infected individual coughs or sneezes, but also when he speaks or simply breezes, the majority of emitted particles being smaller than 1 μm. Preliminary data indicate the presence of viral RNA in air samples and on surfaces far from source patients. However, it is important to note that the detection of viral genetic material by RT-PCR does not mean that the virus is alive or infectious. According to data on the quantification of the infective power of such aerosol with small size particles and if such air transmission was confirmed, a larger use of N95 respirators should be promoted particularly in health care units.La connaissance des modes de transmission du SARS-CoV-2 est un élément fondamental dans l’élaboration des stratégies de prévention en santé au travail et en santé publique dans le cadre de la gestion de crise du Covid-19. Le SARS-CoV-2 est retrouvé dans les voies aériennes des patients, y compris asymptomatiques. Les données récentes de la littérature suggèrent un risque de transmission du SARS-CoV-2 par voie aérienne qui a probablement été sous-estimé, notamment via des aérosols générés par la toux ou les éternuements, mais aussi plus simplement la parole et la respiration, et donc la composition est majoritairement le fait de particules dont le diamètre est inférieur ou égal à 1 μm. Des données préliminaires montrent la présence d'ARN viral dans l'air et sur des surfaces distantes des patients sources. Cependant, il est important de noter que la détection de matériel génétique viral par RT-PCR ne signifie pas que le virus soit vivant et infectant. En fonction de données sur la quantification du pouvoir infectant des aérosols de petite taille et si l'hypothèse d'une telle transmission était confirmée, les indications de port des protections respiratoires de type FFP2 mériteraient d’être élargies, notamment en milieu de soin.","Gehanno, J.

This article provides experimental evidence about one potentially important driver of compliance with social distancing: social norms. We asked each of 23,000 survey respondents in Mexico to predict how a fictional person would behave when faced with the choice about whether or not to attend a friend's birthday gathering. Every respondent was randomly assigned to one of four social norms conditions. Expecting that other people would attend the gathering and/or believing that other people approved of attending the gathering both increased the predicted probability that the fictional character would attend the gathering by 25%, in comparison with a scenario where other people were not expected to attend nor to approve of attending. Our results speak to the potential effects of communication campaigns and media coverage of compliance with, and normative views about, COVID-19 preventive measures.

Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-COV-2). Its clinical manifestations mainly include fever, fatigue, and dry cough. Clinical practice showed that Qigong had some therapeutic effects on pulmonary dysfunction caused by novel Coronavirus, but there was lacking in evidence of evidence-based medicine. The purpose of this protocol is to systematically evaluate the effects of Qigong on lung function and quality of life in COVID-19 patients, and to add evidence to evidence-based medicine for the clinical application of Qigong therapy. METHODS: Use computer to retrieve English database (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library) and Chinese database (China Knowledge Network (CNKI), Wanfang Database, VIP Information Chinese Journal Service Platform (VIP), Chinese Biomedical Database).

Increased ROMO1 expression was reported in various cancer cell lines; however, the possible association between ROMO1 expression and bladder cancer was not well studied. The present study aimed to investigate the rate of ROMO1 expression and the correlation of oxidative stress with the development of bladder cancer. In this study, a total of 35 cancerous and healthy adjacent tissues were examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to analyze the gene expression of ROMO1. Also, we evaluated the serum level of ROMO1 and Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC), as well as Total Oxidant Status (TOS) in patients with bladder cancer along with age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. The ROMO1 gene was significantly higher in cancerous tissues than that of adjacent healthy tissues. Also, the serum levels of ROMO1, TAC, TOS, and Oxidative Stress Index (OSI) were increased in patients with bladder cancer compared with healthy subjects. It can be concluded that the overexpression of the ROMO1 gene is associated with advanced grades of bladder cancer as well as an increase in oxidative stress conditions. Our findings also suggest that the serum level of ROMO1 might be a promising tumor marker for bladder cancer.","Ghasemi, Hadi; Amini, Mohammad Amin; Pegah, Atefeh; Azizi, Ebrahim; Tayebinia, Heidar; Khanverdilou, Shima; Mousavibahar, Seyed Habibollah; Alizamir, Aida",Mol.

Here, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and coronavirus antigen microarray (COVAM) analysis mapped antibody epitopes in the plasma of COVID-19 patients (n = 86) experiencing a wide range of disease states. The experiments identified antibodies to a 21-residue epitope from nucleocapsid (termed Ep9) associated with severe disease, including admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), requirement for ventilators, or death. Importantly, anti-Ep9 antibodies can be detected within 6 days post-symptom onset and sometimes within 1 day. Furthermore, anti-Ep9 antibodies correlate with various comorbidities and hallmarks of immune hyperactivity. We introduce a simple-to-calculate, disease risk factor score to quantitate each patient's comorbidities and age. For patients with anti-Ep9 antibodies, scores above 3.0 predict more severe disease outcomes with a 13.42 likelihood ratio (96.7% specificity). The results lay the groundwork for a new type of COVID-19 prognostic to allow early identification and triage of high-risk patients. Such information could guide more effective therapeutic intervention.IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over two million deaths worldwide. Despite efforts to fight the virus, the disease continues to overwhelm hospitals with severely ill patients. Diagnosis of COVID-19 is readily accomplished through a multitude of reliable testing platforms; however, prognostic prediction remains elusive. To this end, we identified a short epitope from the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and also a disease risk factor score based upon comorbidities and age.

We study three influential face and person recognition datasets - DukeMTMC, MS-Celeb-1M, and Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) - by analyzing nearly 1000 papers that cite them. We found that the creation of derivative datasets and models, broader technological and social change, the lack of clarity of licenses, and dataset management practices can introduce a wide range of ethical concerns.

The study about features of this infection could be very helpful in better knowledge about this infectious disease. The current systematic review and meta-analysis were aimed to estimate the prevalence of clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic review using Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and Google scholar has been conducted. In the current systematic review and meta-analysis, the articles published in the period January 1, 2020, to April 2, 2020, written in English and reporting clinical symptoms of COVID-19 was reviewed. To assess, the presence of heterogeneity, the Cochran's Q statistic, the I2 index, and the tau-squared test were used. Because of significant heterogeneity between the studies the random-effects model with 95% CI was used to calculate the pooled estimation of each symptom prevalence. Results: The most common symptoms in COVID-19 patients include: Fever 81.2% (95% CI: 77.9-84.4); Cough: 58.5% (95% CI: 54.2-62.8); Fatigue 38.5% (95% CI: 30.6-45.3); Dyspnea: 26.1% (95% CI: 20.4-31.8); and the Sputum: 25.8% (95% CI: 21.1-30.4). Based on the meta-regression results, the sample size used in different studies did not have a significant effect on the final estimate value (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Considering the main symptoms of COVID-19 such as Fever, Cough, Fatigue, and Dyspnea can have a key role in early detection of this disease and prevent the transmission of the disease to other people.","Alimohamadi, Yousef; Sepandi, Mojtaba; Taghdir, Maryam; Hosamirudsari, Hadiseh",J Prev Med Hyg,,585

This feature, possibly due to the increase of social awareness, can be rationalised by a susceptible-hidden-infected-recovered (SHIR) model introduced by Barnes, in which a hidden (isolated from the virus) compartment H is gradually populated by susceptible people, thus reducing the effectiveness of the virus spreading. By introducing a partial hiding mechanism, for instance due to the impossibility for a fraction of the population to enter the hidden state, we obtain a model that, although still sufficiently simple, faithfully reproduces the different deceleration trends observed in several major countries.","Barzon, Giacomo; Rugel, Wolfgang; Manjunatha, Karan Kabbur Hanumanthappa; Orlandini, Enzo; Baiesi, Marco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03416v1.pdf,585

By using the logistic regression model, we identified novel critical factors associated with COVID19 cases, death, and case fatality rates in 154 countries and in the 50 U.S. states. Among numerous factors associated with COVID-19 risk, economic inequality enhanced the risk of COVID-19 transmission. The per capita hospital beds correlated negatively with COVID-19 deaths. Blood types B and AB were protective factors for COVID-19 risk, while blood type A was a risk factor. The prevalence of HIV and influenza and pneumonia was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk. Increased intake of vegetables, edible oil, protein, vitamin D, and vitamin K was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk, while increased intake of alcohol was associated with increased COVID-19 risk. Other factors included age, sex, temperature, humidity, social distancing, smoking, health investment, urbanization level, and race. High temperature is a more compelling factor mitigating COVID-19 transmission than low temperature. Our comprehensive identification of the factors affecting COVID-19 transmission and fatality may provide new insights into the COVID-19 pandemic and advise effective strategies for preventing and migrating COVID-19 spread.","Li, Mengyuan; Zhang, Zhilan; Cao, Wenxiu; Liu, Yijing; Du, Beibei; Chen, Canping; Liu, Qian; Uddin, Md Nazim; Jiang, Shanmei; Chen, Cai; Zhang, Yue; Wang, Xiaosheng",Sci Total Environ,,585

241178,"Covid-19: One in five government contracts had signs of possible corruption, report finds",2021,"OBJECTIVE: Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is usually diagnosed by histological examination of tissue samples; however, effusion cytology offers an opportunity to identify a strong possibility for mesothelioma diagnosis at an early stage. We conducted a retrospective analysis of cytological specimens from a large series of histologically proven MM diagnosed over 19 years. The cases were reviewed and reclassified according to the International System for Reporting Serous Fluid Cytopathology (ISRSFC). METHODS: A total of 450 cases were identified. Cytological analysis was present in 210 patients (164 pleural and 46 peritoneal effusions). All cases were reviewed and reclassified according to the proposed ISRSFC scheme. A comparison among the cytomorphological features was made throughout the different diagnostic categories. RESULTS: The 210 cases were histologically diagnosed as follows: 192 (91.4%) cases had an epithelioid type and 18 (8.6%) had a sarcomatoid subtype of MM. The cytological cases were reclassified as follows: 2 (0.9%) as non-diagnostic (ND), 81 (38.6%) as negative for malignancy (NFM), 4 (1.9%) as atypia of undetermined significance (AUS), 11 (5.2%) as suspicious for malignancy (SFM), 112 (53.4%) as malignant (MAL). Sarcomatoid cells in the MAL category were characterised cytomorphologically by more pronounced discohesion. In comparison with the epithelioid subtype, the tumour cells appeared solitary with moderate or marked nuclear pleomorphism, and irregular chromatin. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to recognise the cytological characteristics of this aggressive entity to suggest an early and precise possible diagnosis. Morphological features, coupled with clinico-radiological data may help the clinicians in adequately managing the patients.","Straccia, Patrizia; Magnini, Daniele; Trisolini, Rocco; Lococo, Filippo; Chiappetta, Marco; Cancellieri, Alessandra",Cytopathology,,585

RESEARCH QUESTION: This study aimed to investigate the differences in whole leg and lower limb joint stiffness at different walking speeds and the interactions between leg and lower limb joint stiffness. METHODS: Twenty-seven healthy adults, seventeen males (age: 19.6â¯±â¯2.2 years, height: 176.0â¯±â¯6.0â¯cm, mass: 69.7â¯±â¯8.9â¯kg), and ten females (age: 19.1â¯±â¯1.9 years, height: 164.0â¯±â¯3.0â¯cm, mass: 59.6â¯±â¯3.8â¯kg), were recruited. Dynamic leg and joint stiffness were calculated during eccentric loading from data recorded using 3D infrared motion analysis and force plates at slow, normal, and fast walking speeds. Differences in dynamic stiffness, joint angles and moments were explored between the walking speeds using Repeated Measures ANOVA with Sidak post-hoc tests. Correlations between leg, joint stiffness, and walking speed were also explored. RESULTS: The results indicated that the leg dynamic stiffness is decreased by walking speed, however, hip and ankle joint stiffness were increased (pâ¯<â¯0.001) and knee stiffness was unaffected. Leg stiffness showed no correlation with hip, knee, or ankle stiffness. A positive significant correlation was seen between hip and ankle stiffness (pâ¯<â¯0.01) and between knee and ankle stiffness (pâ¯<â¯0.001), however, no correlation was seen between hip and knee stiffness. SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest leg stiffness is not associated with lower limb joint stiffness during eccentric loading. This provides new information on the responses of ankle, knee and hip joint stiffness to walking speed.","Akl, Abdel-Rahman; Baca, Arnold; Richards, Jim; Conceição, Filipe",Gait Posture,,585

Neutrophils infiltrate BP skin lesions, however, their role in immune dysregulation remains unclear. We investigated whether BP involves aberrant neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation in skin lesions and circulation; and examined the triggers and deleterious immuno-inflammatory consequences. In the present study, we found that circulating NET-related biomarker levels increased in serum and blister fluid of BP patients and significantly correlated with disease severity. Additionally, circulating neutrophils from BP patients displayed enhanced spontaneous NETs formation than healthy controls. In vitro, BP180-NC16A immune complexes-induced NETosis in neutrophils from BP patients, which was abrogated by FcÎ³ receptor and/or NADPH pathway blockade. Furthermore, the elevated levels of NETs from BP patients boosted autoantibody production by inducing B-cell differentiation into plasma cells, mediated by MAPK P38 cascade activation. Together, our findings provide strong evidence that NETs are involved in a pathogenic loop, causing excessive differentiation of B cells and promotion of autoantibody production. Hence, targeting aberrant neutrophil responses will provide novel potential targets for the treatment of BP.","Fang, Hui; Shao, Shuai; Xue, Ke; Yuan, Xu; Qiao, Pei; Zhang, Jieyu; Cao, Tianyu; Luo, Yixin; Bai, Xiaocui; Li, Wenjing; Li, Caixia; Qiao, Hongjiang; Dang, Erle; Wang, Gang",FASEB J,,585

METHODS: Over a 10-week low prevalence period we performed confirmatory testing on all newly positive results. Turnaround time was measured and results were analysed to identify a threshold that could be applied as a cut-off for future confirmatory testing and reduce overall workload for the laboratory. RESULTS: Between 22/06/20 and 31/08/20 confirmatory testing was performed on 108 newly positive samples, identifying 32 false positive results (30 %). Turnaround time doubled, increasing by an extra 17 h. There was a highly statistically significant difference between initial Relative Light Unit (RLU) of results that confirmed compared to those that did not, 1176 vs 721 (P < 0.00001). RLU = 1000 was identified as a suitable threshold for confirmatory testing in our laboratory: with RLU &#8805; 1000, 55/56 (98 %) confirmed as positive, whereas with RLU < 1000 only 12/38 (32 %) confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: False positive SARS-CoV-2 tests can be identified by confirmatory testing, yet this may significantly delay results. Establishing a threshold for confirmatory testing streamlines this process to focus only on samples where it is most required. We advise all laboratories to follow a similar process to identify thresholds that trigger confirmatory testing for their own assays, increasing accuracy while maintaining efficiency for when case numbers are high.","Wilson, Michael J; Sparkes, Dominic; Myers, Chloe; Smielewska, Anna A; Husain, Mir Mubariz; Smith, Christopher; Rolfe, Kathryn J; Zhang, Hongyi; Jalal, Hamid",J Clin Virol,,585

246526,Third places and educational justice: Public libraries in the context of covid-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported a low prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 cases; however, no definitive conclusions can be drawn. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of tobacco smoke exposure with nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) test results for SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity accounting for possible confounders. METHODS: The nationwide, self-administered, cross-sectional web-based Italian National Epidemiological Survey on COVID-19 (EPICOVID19) was administered to an Italian population of 198,822 adult volunteers who filled in an online questionnaire between April 13 and June 2, 2020. For this study, we analyzed 6857 individuals with known NPS test results. The associations of smoking status and the dose-response relationship with a positive NPS test result and infection severity were calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs by means of logistic and multinomial regression models adjusting for sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral characteristics. RESULTS: Out of the 6857 individuals (mean age 47.9 years, SD 14.1; 4516/6857, 65.9% female), 63.2% (4334/6857) had never smoked, 21.3% (1463/6857) were former smokers, and 15.5% (1060/6857) were current smokers. Compared to nonsmokers, current smokers were younger, were more educated, were less affected by chronic diseases, reported COVID-19-like symptoms less frequently, were less frequently hospitalized, and less frequently tested positive for COVID-19. In multivariate analysis, current smokers had almost half the odds of a positive NPS test result (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.45-0.65) compared to nonsmokers. We also found a dose-dependent relationship with tobacco smoke: mild smokers (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.76, 95% CI 0.55-1.05), moderate smokers (aOR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42-0.73), and heavy smokers (aOR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27-0.53). This inverse association also persisted when considering the severity of the infection. Current smokers had a statistically significantly lower probability of having asymptomatic (aOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27-0.92), mild (aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.81), and severe infections (aOR 0.27, 95% CI 0.17-0.42) compared to those who never smoked. CONCLUSIONS: Current smoking was negatively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection with a dose-dependent relationship.

Many properties of COVID-19 infection and transmission were still not yet established. METHODS: We collated and analysed data on 449 of the earliest COVID-19 cases detected outside Hubei province to make inferences about transmission dynamics and severity of infection. We analysed 64 clusters to make inferences on serial interval and potential role of pre-symptomatic transmission. RESULTS: We estimated an epidemic doubling time of 5.3 days (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.3, 6.7) and a median incubation period of 4.6 days (95% CI: 4.0, 5.2). We estimated a serial interval distribution with mean 5.7 days (95% CI: 4.7, 6.8) and standard deviation 3.5 days, and effective reproductive number was 1.98 (95% CI: 1.68, 2.35). We estimated that 32/80 (40%) of transmission events were likely to have occurred prior to symptoms onset in primary cases. Secondary cases in clusters had less severe illness on average than cluster primary cases. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of transmissions are occurring around illness onset in an infected person, and pre-symptomatic transmission does play a role. Detection of milder infections among the secondary cases may be more reflective of true disease severity.","Ren, Xiang; Li, Yu; Yang, Xiaokun; Li, Zhili; Cui, Jinzhao; Zhu, Aiqin; Zhao, Hongting; Yu, Jianxing; Nie, Taoran; Ren, Minrui; Dong, Shuaibing; Cheng, Ying; Chen, Qiulan; Chang, Zhaorui; Sun, Junling; Wang, Liping; Feng, Luzhao; Gao, George F; Feng, Zijian; Li, Zhongjie",Influenza other respir. viruses,,585

To date, sporadic studies have demonstrated that innate immune mechanisms, specifically neutrophilia, NETosis, and neutrophil-associated cytokine responses, are involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis; however, our understanding of the exact nature of this aspect of host-pathogen interaction is limited. Here, we present a detailed dissection of the features and functional profiles of neutrophils, dendritic cells, and monocytes in COVID-19. We portray the crucial role of neutrophils as drivers of hyperinflammation associated with COVID-19 disease via the shift towards their immature forms, enhanced degranulation, cytokine production, and augmented interferon responses. We demonstrate the impaired functionality of COVID-19 dendritic cells and monocytes, particularly their low expression of maturation markers, increased PD-L1 levels, and their inability to upregulate phenotype upon stimulation. In summary, our work highlights important data that prompt further research, as therapeutic targeting of neutrophils and their associated products may hold the potential to reduce the severity of COVID-19.","Parackova, Zuzana; Zentsova, Irena; Bloomfield, Marketa; Vrabcova, Petra; Smetanova, Jitka; Klocperk, Adam; Meseznikov, Grigorij; Casas Mendez, Luis Fernando; Vymazal, Tomas; Sediva, Anna",,,585

Treatment of cells with auranofin resulted in a 95% reduction in the viral RNA at 48 h after infection. Auranofin treatment dramatically reduced the expression of SARS-COV-2-induced cytokines in human cells. These data indicate that auranofin could be a useful drug to limit SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated lung injury due to its antiviral, anti-inflammatory and anti-reactive oxygen species (ROS) properties. Further animal studies are warranted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of auranofin for the management of SARS-COV-2 associated disease.","Rothan, Hussin A; Stone, Shannon; Natekar, Janhavi; Kumari, Pratima; Arora, Komal; Kumar, Mukesh",Virology,,585

The fine host immune response and its association with the disease course have not yet been fully elucidated. Consequently, we analyze circulating B cell subsets and their possible relationship with COVID-19 features and severity. Methods: Using a multiparametric flow cytometric approach, we determined B cell subsets frequencies from 52 COVID-19 patients, grouped them by hierarchical cluster analysis, and correlated their values with clinical data. Results: The frequency of CD19+ B cells is increased in severe COVID-19 compared to mild cases. Specific subset frequencies such as transitional B cell subsets increase in mild/moderate cases but decrease with the severity of the disease. Memory B compartment decreased in severe and critical cases, and antibody-secreting cells are increased according to the severity of the disease. Other non-typical subsets such as double-negative B cells also showed significant changes according to disease severity. Globally, these differences allow us to identify severity-associated patient clusters with specific altered subsets. Finally, respiratory parameters, biomarkers of inflammation, and clinical scores exhibited correlations with some of these subpopulations. Conclusions: The severity of COVID-19 is accompanied by changes in the B cell subpopulations, either immature or terminally differentiated. Furthermore, the existing relationship of B cell subset frequencies with clinical and laboratory parameters suggest that these lymphocytes could serve as potential biomarkers and even active participants in the adaptive antiviral response mounted against SARS-CoV-2.","Sosa-Hernández, Víctor A; Torres-Ruíz, Jiram; Cervantes-Díaz, Rodrigo; Romero-Ramírez, Sandra; Páez-Franco, José C; Meza-Sánchez, David E; Juárez-Vega, Guillermo; Pérez-Fragoso, Alfredo; Ortiz-Navarrete, Vianney; Ponce-de-León, Alfredo; Llorente, Luis; Berrón-Ruiz, Laura; Mejía-Domínguez, Nancy R; Gómez-Martín, Diana; Maravillas-Montero, José L",Front Immunol,,585

The pandemic of COVID-19 brought an additional challenge, as hospital structures equipped with doctors, intensive care units and respirators are not available to a sufficient extent in all regions. Using Data Envelopment Analysis, we create a COVID Index to verify whether the hospital structures in 543 Brazilian microregions are adequate to deal with COVID-19 and to verify whether public policies were implemented in the right direction. The results indicate that hospital structures in the poorest microregions were the most vulnerable, although the peak of COVID-19 occurred in the richest microregions (Sao Paulo). The Southeast states could relocate hospital resources or even patients between their regions. The relocation was not possible in many states in the Northeast, as the health system poorly assisted the interior of these states. These findings reveal that the heterogeneity of microregions' hospital structures follows the patterns of socioeconomic inequalities. We conclude that it is easier for the wealthier regions to reallocate hospital resources internally than for the poorest regions. By using the COVID Index, policymakers and hospital managers have straightforward information to decide which regions must receive new investments and reallocate underutilized resources.","Ferraz, Diogo; Mariano, Enzo Barberio; Manzine, Patricia Regina; Moralles, Herick Fernando; Morceiro, Paulo César; Torres, Bruno Guimarães; de Almeida, Mariana Rodrigues; Soares de Mello, João Carlos; Rebelatto, Daisy Aparecida do Nascimento",Soc Indic Res,,585

251528,Historical data series of COVID-19 in different countries,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Complex critical syndromes like sepsis and COVID-19 may be composed of underlying subclasses, or 'endotypes,' which may respond differently to treatment We previously reported the discovery and validation of a 33-mRNA host response classifier which defined three sepsis endotypes across 1,300 patients with bacterial sepsis at hospital or ICU admission Here, we aimed to test whether our 33-mRNA bacterial sepsis endotypes classifier recapitulates the same clinical and immunological endotypes in COVID-19 METHODS: In this prospective, single-center observational cohort study, we recruited adult patients with RT-PCRconfirmed COVID-19 within 24 hours of admission to an Athens, Greece hospital RNA was extracted from whole blood collected in PAXgene RNA tubes, and then profiled on the NanoString nCounter® platform to quantify the 33 mRNAs The endotypes classifier then assigned one of three endotypes (Inflammopathic, Adaptive, or Coagulopathic) to each patient We tested endotype status against other clinical parameters including lab values, severity scores, and outcomes RESULTS: We enrolled 71 patients with COVID-19, of which 33 went on to severe respiratory failure (SRF), of which 6 (8%) died Patients were assigned as Inflammopathic (34%), Adaptive (39%), or Coagulopathic (27%);Adaptive patients had lower rates of SRF and no mortalities Coagulopathic and Inflammopathic endotypes had 12% and 16% mortality rates The Coagulopathic group was significantly associated with D-dimers, and the Inflammopathic group showed high clinical severity and highest C-reactive protein and IL-6 levels CONCLUSIONS: Our predefined 33-mRNA endotypes classifier recapitulated immune phenotypes in viral sepsis (COVID-19) despite its prior training and validation only in bacterial sepsis Further work should focus on continued validation of the endotypes and their interaction with immunomodulatory therapy If confirmed with future studies, the 33-mRNA classifer could be used as a companiondiagnostic test to guide a precision-medicine-based intervention","Sweeney, T.; Liesenfeld, O.; Wacker, J.; He, Y.; Rawling, D.; Remmel, M.; Coyle, S.; Midic, U.; Kotsaki, A.; Kavanou, A.; Leventogiannis, K.; Kontogeorgou, I.; Giamarellos, E.",Critical Care Medicine,,585

252080,Representation and Usage of Media During COVID-19 (preprint),2020,"Human coronaviruses are RNA viruses that are sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Sunlight contains UVA (320-400 nm), UVB (260-320 nm) and UVC (200-260 nm) action spectra. UVC can inactivate coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The incidence and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are considered to be correlated with vitamin D levels. Vitamin D synthesis in human skin is closely related to exposure to UVB radiation. Therefore, the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 are also considered to be correlated with Vitamin D levels. In this study, Spearman and Kendall rank correlation analysis tests were used to analyze the correlation between the average percent positive of five human coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, CoVHKU1, CoVNL63, CoVOC43, and CoV229E) in the U.S. and the corresponding sunlight UV radiation dose The results indicated that the monthly average percent positive of four common coronaviruses was significantly negatively correlated with the sunlight UV radiation dose. The weekly percent positive of SARS-CoV-2 during April 17, 2020 to July 10, 2020 showed a significant negative correlation with the sunlight UV radiation dose in census regions 1 and 2 of the U.S. while no statistical significance in the other regions. Additionally, sunlight UV radiation also showed some negative effects with respect to the early SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Tang, Liwei; Liu, Min; Ren, Bingyu; Wu, Zongting; Yu, Xunci; Peng, Chen; Tian, Jing",Sci Total Environ,,585
252370,The Use and Misuse of Mathematical Modeling for Infectious Disease Policymaking: Lessons for the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Most persons with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have no or mild symptoms. During the COVID-19 pandemic, communities need efficient methods to monitor asymptomatic patients to reduce transmission. We describe the structure and operating protocols of a community treatment center (CTC) run by Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH) in South Korea. SNUH converted an existing facility into a CTC to isolate patients who had confirmed COVID-19 but mild or no symptoms. Patients reported self-measured vital signs and symptoms twice a day by using a smartphone application. Medical staff in a remote monitoring center at SNUH reviewed patient vital signs and provided video consultation to patients twice daily. The CTC required few medical staff to perform medical tests, monitor patients, and respond to emergencies. During March 5-26, 2020, we admitted and treated 113 patients at this center. CTCs could be an alternative to hospital admission for isolating patients and preventing community transmission.","Kang, EunKyo; Lee, Sun Young; Jung, Hyemin; Kim, Min Sun; Cho, Belong; Kim, Yon Su",Emerg. infect. dis,,585

252491,Disease avoidance in the time of COVID-19: The behavioral immune system is associated with concern and preventative health behaviors,2020,"The number of COVID-19 deaths reported from European countries has varied more than 100-fold In terms of coronavirus transmission, the relatively low death rates in some countries could be due to low intrinsic (e g low population density) or imposed contact rates (e g non-pharmaceutical interventions) among individuals, or because fewer people were exposed or susceptible to infection (e g smaller populations) Here, we develop a flexible empirical model (skew-logistic) to distinguish among these possibilities We find that countries reporting fewer deaths did not generally have intrinsically lower rates of transmission and epidemic growth, and flatter epidemic curves Rather, countries with fewer deaths locked down earlier, had shorter epidemics that peaked sooner and smaller populations Consequently, as lockdowns were eased, we expected, and duly observed, a resurgence of COVID-19 across Europe","Dye, C.; Cheng, R.

252552,Stochastic approach to study control strategies of Covid-19 pandemic in India,2020-06-11,"L'érythème noueux (EN) est la forme clinique la plus fréquente des hypodermites aiguës. Il survient le souvent chez la femme entre 25 et 40 ans. Les causes les plus fréquentes sont les infections à streptocoques β-hémolytiques, la sarcoïdose, la yersiniose, la tuberculose et les entéropathies chroniques. Des cas d'EN associés à une infection par le SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) ont été récemment publiés. Nous en rapportons un nouveau cas. Un homme de 32 ans sans antécédents était hospitalisé dans notre service de dermatologie pour prise en charge diagnostique et thérapeutique de multiples nodules sous cutanés au niveau des faces d'extension des membres évoluant depuis 2 semaines dans un contexte de fièvre et de syndrome pseudo-grippal. L'examen clinique a montré de multiples nouures de quelques centimètres de diamètre confluentes par endroit, chaudes, fermes et douloureuses à la palpation associées à un œdème déclive des chevilles cadrant typiquement avec un EN. Le patient avait une gorge érythémateuse. Il était fébrile à 39 °C, tachycarde et légèrement polypnéique avec un taux de saturation en oxygène à 97 %. La vitesse de sédimentation était accélérée. Le patient a été mis initialement sous amoxicilline pendant 6 jours sans amélioration. Le bilan étiologique de l'EN à savoir le dosage des ASLO, l'examen bactériologique du frottis de gorge, la radiographie de thorax, l'IDR à la tuberculine, la sérologie des hépatites B et C et le dosage de l'enzyme de conversion était négatif. Devant le contexte pandémique de COVID-19, les signes respiratoires, la fièvre et le syndrome inflammatoire biologique, un prélèvement nasopharyngé pour le test PCR COVID-19 a été pratiqué et revenu positif. Le diagnostic d'EN associé au COVID-19 a été retenu. Le patient a été mis sous traitement symptomatique avec une bonne évolution de l'EN et une régression des signes de COVID-19. Différentes manifestations cutanées possiblement associées à la COVID-19 ont été rapportées dans la littérature. Elles sont considérées comme des présentations peu fréquentes au cours de cette infection. La physiopathologie de cette association reste, à ce jour, mal élucidée. Les lésions cutanées semblent se distribuer en quatre groupes, soient des atteintes à type d'exanthème (papulo-vésiculeux, varicelle-like et rash morbilliforme), de nature vasculaire (perniose, purpura, livédo), éruption urticarienne ou papuleuse acrale et des éruptions induites par des médicaments prescrits dans le cadre de COVID-19. D'autres lésions ont été rarement rapportées tel que l'EN, comme dans notre cas. En effet, l'infection par la COVID-19 induit une dysrégulation de la réponse immunitaire avec une élévation des interleukines (IL) 1, 2, 6, 7 et 10. Le virus pourrait infecter les cellules via les récepteurs de l'enzyme de conversion de l'angiotensine retrouvés sur plusieurs organes y inclus la peau. La pathogénie de l'EN demeure mal comprise mais une réaction d'hypersensibilité retardée médiée par l'exposition à un antigène a été rapportée. Au cours de l'EN, un polymorphisme des gènes promoteurs de l'IL 1 et 6 associé à un taux élevé d'IL 6 ont été décrits, suggérant une susceptibilité plus importante de développer un EN au cours des situations de dysrégulation immunitaire et de réaction inflammatoire excessive telle que l'infection par la COVID-19. Ceci pourrait expliquer partiellement le lien de causalité entre l'EN et la COVID-19. Chez notre patient, l'infection virale récente était le seul facteur déclenchant retrouvé. La COVID-19 est responsable essentiellement de manifestations respiratoires, toutefois, les atteintes cutanées pourraient jouer un rôle important dans le diagnostic précoce de la maladie limitant la propagation de la pandémie. Ainsi, un EN associé à une fièvre et des signes respiratoires pourrait être attribué à une infection par la COVID-19.

252653,Study on soybean potential productivity and food security in China under the influence of COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"Coronaviruses play an important role as pathogens of humans and animals, and the emergence of epidemics like SARS, MERS and COVID-19 is closely linked to zoonotic transmission events primarily from wild animals. Bats have been found to be an important source of coronaviruses with some of them having the potential to infect humans, with other animals serving as intermediate or alternate hosts or reservoirs. Host diversity may be an important contributor to viral diversity and thus the potential for zoonotic events. To date, limited research has been done in Africa on this topic, in particular in the Congo Basin despite frequent contact between humans and wildlife in this region. We sampled and, using consensus coronavirus PCR-primers, tested 3,561 wild animals for coronavirus RNA. The focus was on bats (38%), rodents (38%), and primates (23%) that posed an elevated risk for contact with people, and we found coronavirus RNA in 121 animals, of which all but two were bats. Depending on the taxonomic family, bats were significantly more likely to be coronavirus RNA-positive when sampled either in the wet (Pteropodidae and Rhinolophidae) or dry season (Hipposideridae, Miniopteridae, Molossidae, and Vespertilionidae). The detected RNA sequences correspond to 15 alpha- and 6 betacoronaviruses, with some of them being very similar (>95% nucleotide identities) to known coronaviruses and others being more unique and potentially representing novel viruses. In seven of the bats, we detected RNA most closely related to sequences of the human common cold coronaviruses 229E or NL63 (>80% nucleotide identities). The findings highlight the potential for coronavirus spillover, especially in regions with a high diversity of bats and close human contact, and reinforces the need for ongoing surveillance.","Kumakamba, Charles; Niama, Fabien R; Muyembe, Francisca; Mombouli, Jean-Vivien; Kingebeni, Placide Mbala; Nina, Rock Aime; Lukusa, Ipos Ngay; Bounga, Gerard; N039,; Kawa, Frida; Nkoua, Cynthia Goma; Atibu Losoma, Joseph; Mulembakani, Prime; Makuwa, Maria; Tamufe, Ubald; Gillis, Amethyst; LeBreton, Matthew; Olson, Sarah H; Cameron, Kenneth; Reed, Patricia; Ondzie, Alain; Tremeau-Bravard, Alex; Smith, Brett R; Pante, Jasmine; Schneider, Bradley S; McIver, David J; Ayukekbong, James A; Hoff, Nicole A; Rimoin, Anne W; Laudisoit, Anne; Monagin, Corina; Goldstein, Tracey; Joly, Damien O; Saylors, Karen; Wolfe, Nathan D; Rubin, Edward M; Bagamboula MPassi, Romain; Muyembe Tamfum, Jean J; Lange, Christian E",PLoS One,,585

253152,Psychological resilience of COVID-19 frontline warriors: Need of the hour,2020,"To tackle the COVID-19 outbreak, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is an unmet need for highly accurate diagnostic tests at all stages of infection with rapid results and high specificity. Here, we present a label-free nanoplasmonic biosensor-based, multiplex screening test for COVID-19 that can quantitatively detect 10 different biomarkers (6 viral nucleic acid genes, 2 spike protein subunits, and 2 antibodies) with a limit of detection in the aM range, all within one biosensor platform. Our newly developed nanoplasmonic biosensors demonstrate high specificity, which is of the upmost importance to avoid false responses. As a proof of concept, we show that our detection approach has the potential to quantify both IgG and IgM antibodies directly from COVID-19-positive patient plasma samples in a single instrument run, demonstrating the high-throughput capability of our detection approach. Most importantly, our assay provides receiving operating characteristics, areas under the curve of 0.997 and 0.999 for IgG and IgM, respectively. The calculated p-value determined through the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test is <0.0001 for both antibodies when the test of COVID-19-positive patients (n = 80) is compared with that of healthy individuals (n = 72). Additionally, the screening test provides a calculated sensitivity (true positive rate) of 100% (80/80), a specificity (true negative rate) >96% (77/80), a positive predictive value of 98% at 5% prevalence, and a negative predictive value of 100% at 5% prevalence. We believe that our very sensitive, multiplex, high-throughput testing approach has potential applications in COVID-19 diagnostics, particularly in determining virus progression and infection severity for clinicians for an appropriate treatment, and will also prove to be a very effective diagnostic test when applied to diseases beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Masterson, Adrianna N; Muhoberac, Barry B; Gopinadhan, Adnan; Wilde, David J; Deiss, Frédérique T; John, Chandy C; Sardar, Rajesh",Anal Chem,,585

Here, we examined the relationship between immune processes in the respiratory tract and circulation through longitudinal phenotypic, transcriptomic, and cytokine profiling of paired airway and blood samples from patients with severe COVID-19 relative to heathy controls. In COVID-19 airways, T cells exhibited activated, tissue-resident, and protective profiles; higher T cell frequencies correlated with survival and younger age. Myeloid cells in COVID-19 airways featured hyperinflammatory signatures, and higher frequencies of these cells correlated with mortality and older age. In COVID-19 blood, aberrant CD163+ monocytes predominated over conventional monocytes, and were found in corresponding airway samples and in damaged alveoli. High levels of myeloid chemoattractants in airways suggest recruitment of these cells through a CCL2-CCR2 chemokine axis.

254197,Mentoring during the COVID-19 pandemic: a perspective from graduate students in biomedical science studies in India,2021,"BACKGROUND: Based on the status of the COVID-19 global pandemic, there is an urgent need to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of wearing masks to protect public health from COVID-19 infection. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement was consulted to report this systematic review. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of using face masks to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP (Chinese) database. There were no language restrictions. This study was registered with PROSPERO under the number CRD42020211862. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies were included, involving 4 countries, after a total of 5,178 eligible articles were searched in databases and references. In general, wearing a mask was associated with a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 infection (ORâ¯=â¯0.38, 95% CI: 0.21-0.69, I2â¯=â¯54.1%). For the healthcare workers group, masks were shown to have a reduced risk of infection by nearly 70%. Sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis support the conclusion that wearing a mask could reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection. Robust randomized trials are needed in the future to better provide evidence for these interventions.","Li, Yanni; Liang, Mingming; Gao, Liang; Ayaz Ahmed, Mubashir; Uy, John Patrick; Cheng, Ce; Zhou, Qin; Sun, Chenyu",Am. j. infect. control,,585
254537,Global Challenges of Being a Strength Athlete during a Pandemic: Impacts and Sports-Specific Training Considerations and Recommendations,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is the most widely used protocol for activating a stress response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis and other stress-mediating systems. A number of variants of the TSST exist, including ones for children, groups, and virtual reality. All of these versions, though, require in-person assessment. The COVID-19 pandemic has made in-person assessment impossible or extremely difficult and potentially dangerous. The purpose of this study was to validate a completely remote, online, version of the TSST for children. METHOD: A sample of 68 (27 female) 15- and 16-year old participants were administered the TSST-Online (TSST-OL) during the late afternoon hours (3-6 p.m. start time). The participants, judges (one male, one female), and experimenter (female) all joined the assessment from their own homes via the online platform, ZOOM&#8482;. Two sessions were conducted, one to obtain consent, explain procedures, work with the family to arrange the computer and room set-up for the TSST-OL and one within two weeks to conduct the procedure. The participants were trained to take their own saliva samples and a saliva sampling kit was mailed to the home in between the first and second session. The samples were then mailed to the researchers within a day of collection. The participant was observed during saliva collection to determine correct procedures were followed. Salivary cortisol, salivary &#945;-amylase and self-reports of stress were measured multiple times over the second session. RESULTS: rmANOVAs yielded a significant effect of trials, for cortisol, F(1.37,90.46) = 15.13, p = .001, sAA, F(2.75,146.68) = 6.91, p = .001, and self-rated stress, F(3.43,222.69) = 118.73, p = .001. There were no significant sex by trials interactions for any measure, although females reported more stress than males, F(1,65) = 9.14, p = .004. For cortisol, from baseline to expected peak (30 min after the onset of speech preparation), the Cohen's effect size was dz = 0.57. Using 1.5 nmol/l (or 0.54 µg/dl) as the criterion for a response (Miller, Plessow, Kirschaum, & Stalder, 2013), 63% of the participants produced a significant increase in cortisol. CONCLUSIONS: The responses to the TSST-OL are consistent with in-person responses among children and adolescents (see recent meta-analysis (Seddon et al., 2020). The protocol is a viable way of assessing reactivity of the HPA axis and other stress systems without needing to bring the participant into the research laboratory. This method will be useful during periods of widespread infection. It should also work to study populations who all live too far from the research laboratory to be assessed in person.","Gunnar, Megan R; Reid, Brie M; Donzella, Bonny; Miller, Zachary R; Gardow, Samantha; Tsakonas, Nikola C; Thomas, Kathleen M; DeJoseph, Meriah; Bendezú, Jason José",Psychoneuroendocrinology,,585

254776,The impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on marine litter pollution along the Kenyan Coast: A synthesis after 100 days following the first reported case in Kenya,2020,"INTRODUCTION: We designed a follow-up study of frontline health workers at COVID-19 patient care, within the same working conditions, to assess the influence of their general characteristics and pre-existing anxiety/depression/dissociative symptoms and resilience on the development of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), while monitoring their quality of sleep, depersonalization/derealization symptoms, acute stress, state anxiety, and burnout. METHODS: In a Hospital reconfigured to address the surge of patients with COVID-19, 204 frontline health workers accepted to participate. They completed validated questionnaires to assess mental health: before, during, and after the peak of inpatient admissions. After each evaluation, a psychiatrist reviewed the questionnaires, using the accepted criteria for each instrument. Correlations were assessed using multivariable and multivariate analyses, with a significance level of .05. RESULTS: Compared to men, women reporting pre-existing anxiety were more prone to acute stress; and younger age was related to both pre-existent common psychological symptoms and less resilience. Overall the evaluations, sleep quality was bad on the majority of participants, with an increase during the epidemic crisis, while persistent burnout had influence on state anxiety, acute stress, and symptoms of depersonalization/derealization. PTSD symptoms were related to pre-existent anxiety/depression and dissociative symptoms, as well as to acute stress and acute anxiety, and negatively related to resilience. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-existent anxiety/depression, dissociative symptoms, and coexisting acute anxiety and acute stress contribute to PTSD symptoms. During an infectious outbreak, psychological screening could provide valuable information to prevent or mitigate against adverse psychological reactions by frontline healthcare workers caring for patients.","Miguel-Puga, José Adán; Cooper-Bribiesca, Davis; Avelar-Garnica, Francisco José; Sanchez-Hurtado, Luis Alejandro; Colin-Martínez, Tania; Espinosa-Poblano, Eliseo; Anda-Garay, Juan Carlos; González-Díaz, Jorge Iván; Segura-Santos, Oscar Bernardo; Vital-Arriaga, Luz Cristina; Jáuregui-Renaud, Kathrine",Brain Behav,,585

Chi-squared test and logistic regression were used for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 583 OHCW participated in this study. The odds of having the awareness about the risk of exposure and fear of getting infected, were greater in the clinical than non-clinical OHCW (OR: 52.6; OR: 15.9). For social network concerns, the clinical OHCW were more likely to be concerned about their colleagues (OR: 6.0). The clinical OHCW have greater odds of worrying about telling the family/friends about the risk exposed to (OR: 2.55), being avoided because of the job (OR: 3.20) and more likely to be feeling stressed (OR: 4.31). Less than 50% of the participants felt that their institutions are well prepared and only 12.6% had attended an infection control training session. Most participants practiced self-preparation such as buying masks and disinfection (94.3%, 98.3%). CONCLUSION: The majority of OHCW felt concerned about their risk of exposure to infection and falling ill from exposure and infecting friends/family. There is a need for training of infection control and PPE and minimizing fear and psychological impact on OHCW should be the priority in any preparedness and planning for combating COVID-19.","Chaudhary, Farooq Ahmad; Ahmad, Basaruddin; Ahmad, Paras; Khalid, Muhammad Danial; Butt, Danial Qasim; Khan, Soban Qadir",J Occup Health,,585

It is often seen in immunosuppressed patients, and it has high morbidity and mortality. Although the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily affects the respiratory system and causes COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019), it may affect hematopoietic and gastrointestinal systems. Herein, we present a rare case of COVID-19-associated pancytopenia and typhlitis in a 60-year-old female who presented with abdominal pain. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated the bowel wall thickening in the cecum and ascending colon compatible with enterocolitis. Moreover, the chest CT showed bilateral, peripheral, and multifocal ground-glass opacities, consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Adults (N = 3686) completed an online survey with a behavioural measure of delay discounting and questions regarding stress, physical distancing, and stockpiling of food and supplies. Stress was weakly, but positively, correlated with delay discounting (p < 0.01). Delay discounting was positively correlated with stockpiling (p < 0.01); and discounting was negatively correlated with physical distancing (p < 0.01). Mediation models indicated that discounting was a significant mediator of the relationship between stress and physical distancing (-0.003) and stockpiling (0.003); bootstrap 95% CIs (-0.006, -0.001) and (0.001, 0.005), respectively. After accounting for its indirect effects through discounting, stress continued to have a direct effect on these outcomes. This study indicates that delay discounting partially mediates the link between stress and behaviours related to COVID-19. Results suggest that interventions reducing stress and/or delay discounting may be profitable for increasing infection prevention and reducing stockpiling.","DeAngelis, Briana N; Ben Salah, Arwa; al039,; Absi, Mustafa",Stress health (Online),,585

While some more obviously untrustworthy sources may be easier for social media filters to identify and remove, an early feature was the cobranding of COVID-19 misinformation with other types of misinformation. To examine this, the top 10 Instagram posts (in English) were collected every day for 10 days (April 21-30th, 2020) for each of the hashtags #hoax, #governmentlies, and #plandemic. The #hoax was selected first as it is commonly used in conspiracy theory posts, and #governmentlies because it was the most commonly cotagged with #hoax. For comparison, we selected #plandemic as the most popular cotagged hashtag that was clearly COVID-19-related. This resulted in 300 Instagram posts available for our analysis. We conducted a content analysis by coding the themes contained in the posts, both for the images and the text caption shared by the Instagram users (including hashtags). The broad theme of general mistrust was the most common, including the idea that the government and/or media has fabricated or hidden information pertaining to COVID-19. Conspiracy theories were the second-most frequent theme among posts. Overall, COVID-19 was frequently presented in association with authority-questioning beliefs. Developing an understanding of how the public shares misinformation on COVID-19 alongside conspiracy theories and authority-questioning statements can aid public health officials and policymakers in limiting the spread of potentially life-threatening health misinformation.","Quinn, Emma K; Fazel, Sajjad S; Peters, Cheryl E",Cyberpsychology behav. soc. netw.

255762,Acute symptomatic crisis and epilepsy in children and adolescents in times of COVID-19,2020,"Coined three decades ago, the term aptamer and directed evolution have now reached their maturity. The concept that nucleic acid could modulate the activity of target protein as ligand emerged from basic science studies of viruses. Aptamers are short nucleic acid sequences capable of specific, high-affinity molecular binding, which allow for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Compared to traditional antibodies, aptamers have several advantages, including small size, flexible structure, good biocompatibility, and low immunogenicity. In vitro selection method is used to isolate aptamers that are specific for a desired target from a randomized oligonucleotide library. The first aptamer drug, Macugen, was approved by FDA in 2004, which was accompanied by many studies and clinical investigations on various targets and diseases. Despite much promise, most aptamers have failed to meet the requisite safety and efficacy standards in human clinical trials. Amid these setbacks, the emergence of novel technologies and recent advances in aptamer and systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) design are fueling hope in this field. The unique properties of aptamer are gaining renewed interest in an era of COVID-19. The binding performance of an aptamer and reproducibility are still the key issues in tackling current hurdles in clinical translation. A thorough analysis of the aptamer binding under varying conditions and the conformational dynamics is warranted. Here, the challenges and opportunities of aptamers are reviewed with recent progress.","Byun, Jonghoe",,,585

256905,COVID-19 pandemic: Case studies and perspectives,2020,"BACKGROUND: High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is an emerging non-invasive, targeted treatment of malignancy. The aim of this review was to assess the efficacy, safety and optimal technical parameters of HIFU to treat malignant lesions of the hepatobiliary system. METHODS: A systematic search of the English literature was performed until March 2020, interrogating Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. The following key-words were input in various combinations: 'HIFU', 'High intensity focussed ultrasound', 'Hepatobiliary', 'Liver', 'Cancer' and 'Carcinoma'. Extracted content included: Application type, Exposure parameters, Patient demographics, and Treatment outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-four articles reported on the clinical use of HIFU in 940 individuals to treat malignant liver lesions. Twenty-one studies detailed the use of HIFU to treat hepatocellular carcinoma only. Mean tumour size was 5.1 cm. Across all studies, HIFU resulted in complete tumour ablation in 55% of patients. Data on technical parameters and the procedural structure was very heterogeneous. Ten studies (n = 537 (57%) patients) described the use of HIFU alongside other modalities including TACE, RFA and PEI; 66% of which resulted in complete tumour ablation. Most common complications were skin burns (15%), local pain (5%) and fever (2%). CONCLUSION: HIFU has demonstrated benefit as a treatment modality for malignant lesions of the hepatobiliary system. Combining HIFU with other ablative therapies, particularly TACE, increases the efficacy without increasing complications. Future human clinical studies are required to determine the optimal treatment parameters, better define outcomes and explore the risks and benefits of combination therapies.","Sehmbi, Arjan S; Froghi, Saied; Oliveira de Andrade, Matheus; Saffari, Nader; Fuller, Barry; Quaglia, Alberto; Davidson, Brian",HPB (Oxford),,585

257083,"Tax Administration in the Times of An Economic Crisis, COVID-19, Vis-à-Vis India (preprint)",2020,"Background: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a collective term for a group of inflammatory conditions of uncertain origin, which causes chronic arthritis in one or more joints. The clinical course of JIA is characterised by episodes of increased activity, termed flares. Vaccinations have previously been proposed as a ""trigger"" for some flares, although evidence supporting this is scant. Objective: To explore whether routine childhood vaccinations are associated with an increased risk of flares of arthritis activity in children with JIA. Methods: Patients aged below 6 years with a diagnosis of JIA were recruited from the Rheumatology Clinical Database at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, from 1 January 2010 to 30 April 2016. Patient immunisation status was cross-checked with the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR). The self-controlled case series methodology (Rowhani-Rahbar et al., 2012) was applied to determine whether the risk of arthritis flares in the three months following immunisation was greater than the baseline risk for each patient. Results: 138 patients were included in the study. 32 arthritis flares occurred in the 90 days following immunisation. The risk of arthritis flares during the 90 days following immunisation was reduced compared with patients' baseline risk (RR 0.59 (95% CI 0.39-0.89, p = 0.012)). Conclusion: Routine childhood immunisations were not associated with arthritis flare onset in patients with JIA. The risk of arthritis flares in the 90 days following vaccination was lower than the baseline risk. In the context of COVID19, vaccination will not increase interaction with the healthcare system beyond the immunisation encounter.","Alfayadh, Naba M; Gowdie, Peter J; Akikusa, Jonathan D; Easton, Mee Lee; Buttery, Jim P",Int J Rheumatol,,585
257196,Where are the women? Descriptive Representation and COVID-19 in UK Daily Press Briefings,2020,"Persistent post-COVID syndrome, also referred to as long COVID, is a pathologic entity, which involves persistent physical, medical, and cognitive sequelae following COVID-19, including persistent immunosuppression as well as pulmonary, cardiac, and vascular fibrosis. Pathologic fibrosis of organs and vasculature leads to increased mortality and severely worsened quality of life. Inhibiting transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ß), an immuno- and a fibrosis modulator, may attenuate these post-COVID sequelae. Current preclinical and clinical efforts are centered on the mechanisms and manifestations of COVID-19 and its presymptomatic and prodromal periods; by comparison, the postdrome, which occurs in the aftermath of COVID-19, which we refer to as persistent post-COVID-syndrome, has received little attention. Potential long-term effects from post-COVID syndrome will assume increasing importance as a surge of treated patients are discharged from the hospital, placing a burden on healthcare systems, patients' families, and society in general to care for these medically devastated COVID-19 survivors. This review explores underlying mechanisms and possible manifestations of persistent post-COVID syndrome, and presents a framework of strategies for the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected or confirmed persistent post-COVID syndrome.","Oronsky, Bryan; Larson, Christopher; Hammond, Terese C; Oronsky, Arnold; Kesari, Santosh; Lybeck, Michelle; Reid, Tony R",Clin. rev. allergy immunol,,585

257352,Hydroxychloroquine availability during COVID-19 crisis and its effect on patient anxiety,2021,"Modifications in HLA-I expression are found in many viral diseases. They represent one of the immune evasion strategies most widely used by viruses to block antigen presentation and NK cell response, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. These alterations result from a combination of virus-specific factors, genetically encoded mechanisms, and the status of host defences and range from loss or upregulation of HLA-I molecules to selective increases of HLA-I alleles. In this review, I will first analyse characteristic features of altered HLA-I expression found in SARS-CoV-2. I will then discuss the potential factors underlying these defects, focussing on HLA-E and class-I-related (like) molecules and their receptors, the most documented HLA-I alterations. I will also draw attention to potential differences between cells transfected to express viral proteins and those presented as part of authentic infection. Consideration of these factors and others affecting HLA-I expression may provide us with improved possibilities for research into cellular immunity against viral variants.","Bouayad, Abdellatif",Rev. med. virol,,585

It is unknown whether ethanol-induced alterations in nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) cholinergic projections to the BLA mediate anxiety-related behaviors through direct modulation of GABA and glutamate afferents. Following 10 days of CIE exposure and 24 hours of withdrawal, we recorded GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic responses in BLA pyramidal neurons with electrophysiology, assessed total protein expression of cholinergic markers, and quantified acetylcholine and choline concentrations using a colorimetric assay. We measured &#945; 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) dependent modulation of presynaptic function at distinct inputs in AIR- and CIE-exposed BLA coronal slices as a functional read-out of cholinergic neurotransmission. CIE/withdrawal upregulates the endogenous activity of &#945; 7 nAChRs, facilitating release at both GABAergic' local' interneuron and glutamatergic synaptic responses to stria terminalis (ST) stimulation, with no effect at GABAergic lateral paracapsular cells. CIE caused a three-fold increase in BLA acetylcholine concentration, with no changes in &#945; 7 nAChR or cholinergic marker expression. These data illustrate that &#945; 7 nAChR-dependent changes in presynaptic function serve as a proxy for CIE-dependent alterations in synaptic acetylcholine levels. Thus, cholinergic projections appear to mediate CIE-induced alterations at GABA/glutamate inputs.","Sizer, Sarah E; Parrish, Brian C; McCool, Brian A",Neuroscience,,585
257605,COVID-19 in Bangladesh: measuring differences in individual precautionary behaviors among young adults,2021,"Torture has been illegal in most of Europe and the United States for over a century but persisted in other parts of the world. The changing geopolitical landscape has led to its resurgence in recent years. The public rejection of traditional forms of torture that rely on the infliction of physical pain has paradoxically increased the reliance on psychological methods of torture. This critical commentary aims to define and characterize psychological torture (PT) while exploring practical, legal, ethical and therapeutic implications relevant to clinicians and policymakers. Psychological torture comes in a range of forms. It is being increasingly justified and adopted by legitimate authorities in the name of national security. The emphasis on the avoidance of physical pain leads to the assumption that PT does not produce the levels of suffering and harm that are associated with physically violent forms of torture. This same assumption has allowed for the implication of mental health professionals in theorizing and providing legitimacy for the actions of perpetrators. Psychological torture is still poorly defined with limited understanding of its long-term psychiatric impact on those who are subjected to it. The role of mental health professionals in preventing or addressing psychological torture remains ambiguous and needs to be reinforced.","El-Khoury, Joseph; Haidar, Riwa; Barkil-Oteo, Andres",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,585

The Academy can play a key role in helping the world recover from this pandemic if we build on the diversity and strengths of our programs nationally and globally. We suggest that there are three key actions that pharmacists and pharmacy educators must take to show leadership in this time of need. First, we must be the voice that reassures the public about the value of science and the scientific method. Second, we must work locally and nationally to ensure an optimal public health response. Finally, members of the Academy must serve as role models with respect to the essential public health tools to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Innovative technologies have the potential to address the challenges associated with the manufacture of personalized drug delivery systems, biosensors, and medical devices during a pandemic. 3D-Printing, microfluidics, and Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) can provide an important part on this fight, as are cheap, easy to be operated, capable to provide rapid detection and monitoring of a disease, and deliver medicines. AREAS COVERED: This manuscript answers the question of how these emerging technologies can save lives during a pandemic by avoiding supply chain delays and also by providing rapid diagnostics, disease monitoring, or by offering personalized treatments. The manuscript covers recent approaches in the topic with a focus in manuscripts published in the last year and by emphasising recent regulatory considerations by regulatory agencies in the manufacturing of 3DP systems or other medical devices during COVID. EXPERT OPINION: New manufacturing techniques are emerging with the ability to address the challenges associated with the development of medical devices or diagnostics, during a pandemic. Are many challenges in order to achieve this and especially in short times that are required under a pandemic attack, which will also be covered in this manuscript.","Lamprou, Dimitrios A",Expert Rev Med Devices,,585

261192,Active mobility in an Italian city: Mode choice determinants and attitudes before and during the Covid-19 emergency,2021,"By mid-March 2020, most countries had implemented nationwide lockdown policies aimed at decelerating the spread of SARS-CoV-2. At that time, nobody knew how long these policies would have to remain in force and whether they would have to be extended, intensified or made more flexible. The present study aimed to illuminate how the general public in Germany reacted to the prospect of increasing the length, the intensity and/or the flexibility of distancing rules implied by different lockdown scenarios. Endorsement of and compliance with five specific lockdown scenarios were assessed in a large (N = 14,433) German sample. Results showed that lockdown length affected respondents' reactions much more strongly than intensity or flexibility. Additional analyses (i.e., mixture distribution modelling) showed that half of the respondents rejected any further extensions or intensifications, while 20% would endorse long-term strategies if necessary. We argue that policy-makers and political communicators should take the public's endorsement of and compliance with such scenarios into account, as should simulations predicting the effects of different lockdown scenarios.","Gollwitzer, Mario; Platzer, Christine; Zwarg, Clarissa; Göritz, Anja S",,,585

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) requires liver biopsy for grading and staging the liver damage by the assessment of steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. In parallel with the development of numerous 'liquid' biomarkers and algorithms that combine anthropometric and laboratory parameters, innovative hepatic imaging techniques have increasingly been developed to attempt to overcome the need for biopsy, both in diagnosis and staging of NAFLD, and in possible use in the follow-up of the disease. In this review, we focused on the different imaging techniques trying to highlight the strengths and disadvantages of different approaches, particularly for ultrasound techniques, in stratifying liver injury and fibrosis in patients with NAFLD / NASH.","Miele, Luca; Zocco, Maria A; Pizzolante, Fabrizio; De Matthaeis, Nicoletta; Ainora, Maria E; Liguori, Antonio; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Grieco, Antonio; Rapaccini, Gianludovico",Metabolism,,585
263130,A fragilidade econômica e financeira na pandemia do Sars-Covid-19,2020,"The type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 facilitates the entry of coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, into host cells by cleaving the S1/S2 interface of the viral spike protein. Based on structural data derived from X-ray crystallographic data of related trypsin-like proteases, a homology model of TMPRSS2 is described and validated using the broad spectrum COVID-19 drug candidate camostat as a probe. Both active site recognition and catalytic function are examined using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamic (QM/MM MD) simulations of camostat and its active metabolite, 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy) phenylacetate (GBPA). Substrate binding is shown to be primarily stabilized through salt bridge formation between the shared guanidino pharmacophore and D435 in pocket A (flanking the catalytic S441). Based on the binding mode of GBPA, residues K342 and W461 have been identified as potential contacts involved in TMPRSS2 selective binding and activity. Additional data is reported that indicates the transition state structure is stabilized through H-bonding interactions with the backbone N-H groups within an oxyanion hole following bottom-side attack of the carbonyl by S441. This is supported by prior work on related serine proteases suggesting further strategies to exploit in the design of more potent inhibitors. Taken overall, the proposed structure along with the key contact sites and mechanistic features identified should prove highly advantageous to the design and rational development of safe and effective therapeutics that target TMPRSS2 and avoid inhibition of other trypsin-dependent processes.","Escalante, Diego E; Ferguson, David M",Med Chem Res,,585

The Computerized Classification of Micro-Motions in the hand using waveforms from mobile phone videos is a novel method that uses Eulerian Video Magnification, Skeletonization, Heatmapping, and the kNN machine learning model to detect the micro-motions in the human hand, synthesize their waveforms, and classify these. The pre-processing is achieved by using Eulerian Video Magnification, Skeletonization, and Heat-mapping to magnify the micro-motions, landmark essential features of the hand, and determine the extent of motion, respectively. Following pre-processing, the visible motions are manually labeled by appropriately grouping pixels to represent a particular label correctly. These labeled motions of the pixels are converted into waveforms. Finally, these waveforms are classified into four categories - hand or finger movements, vein movement, background motion, and movement of the rest of the body due to respiration using the kNN model. The final accuracy obtained was around 92 percent.","Ramesh, Ranjani",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06723v1.pdf,585

263845,Online art therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"This paper proposes a new framework based on a wavelet transform and deep neural network for identifying noisy Raman spectrum since, in practice, it is relatively difficult to classify the spectrum under baseline noise and additive white Gaussian noise environments. The framework consists of two main engines. Wavelet transform is proposed as the framework front-end for transforming 1-D noise Raman spectrum to two-dimensional data. This two-dimensional data will be fed to the framework back-end which is a classifier. The optimum classifier is chosen by implementing several traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, and then we investigated their classification accuracy and robustness performances. The four MLs we choose included a Naive Bayes (NB), a Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Random Forest (RF) and a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) where a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) was chosen for a DL classifier. Noise-free, Gaussian noise, baseline noise, and mixed-noise Raman spectrums were applied to train and validate the ML and DCNN models. The optimum back-end classifier was obtained by testing the ML and DCNN models with several noisy Raman spectrums (10-30 dB noise power). Based on the simulation, the accuracy of the DCNN classifier is 9% higher than the NB classifier, 3.5% higher than the RF classifier, 1% higher than the KNN classifier, and 0.5% higher than the SVM classifier. In terms of robustness to the mixed noise scenarios, the framework with DCNN back-end showed superior performance than the other ML back-ends. The DCNN back-end achieved 90% accuracy at 3 dB SNR while NB, SVM, RF, and K-NN back-ends required 27 dB, 22 dB, 27 dB, and 23 dB SNR, respectively. In addition, in the low-noise test data set, the F-measure score of the DCNN back-end exceeded 99.1% while the F-measure scores of the other ML engines were below 98.7%.","Pan, Liangrui; Pipitsunthonsan, Pronthep; Daengngam, Chalongrat; Channumsin, Sittiporn; Sreesawet, Suwat; Chongcheawchamnan, Mitchai",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.04078v1.pdf,585
264100,Structuring the Anesthesia Clinic in COVID-19 Epidemic (Pandemic): DEÜ Anesthesiology Department,2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus is causing devastating morbidity and mortality worldwide. Nanomedicine approaches have a high potential to enhance conventional diagnostics, drugs and vaccines. In fact, lipid nanoparticle/mRNA vaccines are already widely used to protect from COVID-19. In this review, we present an overview of the taxonomy, structure, variants of concern, epidemiology, pathophysiology and detection methods of SARS-CoV-2. The efforts of repurposing, tailoring, and adapting pre-existing medications to battle COVID-19 and the state of vaccine developments are presented. Next, we discuss the broad concepts and limitations of how nanomedicine could address the COVID-19 threat. Nanomaterials are particles in the nanometer scale (10–100 nm) which possess unique properties related to their size, polarity, structural and chemical composition. Nanoparticles can be composed of precious metals (copper, silver, gold), inorganic materials (graphene, silicon), proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, RNA/DNA, or conjugates, combinations and polymers of all of the aforementioned. The advanced biochemical features of these nanoscale particles allow them to directly interact with virions and irreversibly disrupt their structure, which can render a virus incapable of replicating within the host. Virus-neutralizing coats and surfaces impregnated with nanomaterials can enhance personal protective equipment, hand sanitizers and air filter systems. Nanoparticles can enhance drug-based therapies by optimizing uptake, stability, target cell-specific delivery, and magnetic properties. In fact, recent studies have highlighted the potential of nanoparticles in different aspects of the fight against SARS-CoV-2, such as enhancing biosensors and diagnostic tests, drug therapies, designing new delivery mechanisms, and optimizing vaccines. This article summarizes the ongoing research on diagnostic strategies, treatments, and vaccines for COVID-19, while emphasizing the potential of nanoparticle-based pharmaceuticals and vaccines.","Sharma, A.; Kontodimas, K.; Bosmann, M.",Frontiers in Medicine,,585
264146,Military museum collections and art therapy as mental health resources for veterans with PTSD,2020,"We propose a mechanism to allocate slots fairly at congested airports. This mechanism: (a) ensures that the slots are allocated according to the true valuations of airlines, (b) provides fair opportunities to the flights connecting remote cities to large airports, and (c) controls the number of flights in each slot to minimize congestion. The mechanism draws inspiration from economic theory. It allocates the slots based on an affine maximizer allocation rule and charges payments to the airlines such that they are incentivized to reveal their true valuations. The allocation also optimizes the occupancy of every slot to keep them as uncongested as possible. The formulation solves an optimal integral solution in strongly polynomial time. We conduct experiments on the data collected from two major airports in India. We also compare our results with existing allocations and also with the allocations based on the International Air Transport Association (IATA) guidelines. The computational results show that the social utility generated using our mechanism is 20-30% higher than IATA and current allocations.","Dixit, Aasheesh; Shakya, Garima; Jakhar, Suresh Kumar; Lucknow, Swaprava Nath Indian Institute of Management; Kanpur, Indian Institute of Technology",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10134v2.pdf,585

As one of the main aims of science education is the promotion of students' scientific literacy, one of the issues focused on teaching should be aspects of nature of science (NOS) - which can be introduced from discussions in socioscientific contexts. In this paper, we analyse the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to identify and discuss aspects of NOS involved in the production and communication of knowledge about it. We analyse selected scientific publications and reports from the general media, mainly focused on three broad topics about the production and validation of knowledge: (i) the characterisation of the virus, and (ii) the treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, and (iii) the communication of knowledge produced from the characterisation of scientific literature itself in the pandemic period. The analysis was carried out from a model that presents a broad and complex view of science, as it addresses several areas of knowledge and specific aspects of each of them and proposes the generation of one's view of science from an integration of some of its distinct areas and/or aspects. The results show the current pandemic is a rich socioscientific context whose discussion of social, political, economic, and ethical aspects may support students' learning of nature of science, thus fostering scientific literacy.","Maia, Poliana; Justi, Rosária; Santos, Monique",Sci Educ (Dordr),,585

The secondary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbate the health and development risks girls face. This article describes how the number of programs, policies, and studies targeting adolescent girls have increased in recent years, making higher quality evidence more available. However, systematic reviews of the evidence on intervention effectiveness often conclude with mixed results and implications. More research is needed on the under-explored dimensions of gender policies so policymakers can direct limited resources toward approaches proven to improve adolescent girls’ health, education, and wellbeing. Furthermore, ensuring the connection between evidence generation and evidence use remains an important—albeit unfinished—agenda, as demonstrated by case studies on evidence-informed policymaking for rural indigenous girls in Guatemala and girls at high risk of child marriage in Bangladesh. If adolescent girls are to thrive in tomorrow’s world, smarter investments are needed today to enable them to reach their full potential.","Temin, Miriam Misunas Christina Martin Erika",The SAIS Review of International Affairs,,585

The goal of this paper is to describe the development steps and current design of a system providing medication decision support for isolated patients. With an increased number of patients living alone or isolated - a situation exacerbated during the COVID19 pandemic - polypharmacy patients may be challenged when PRN (as needed) medications confound what might ordinarily be a routine medication schedule. Central to our medication management system design is the so-called ""conversational agent"" that when integrated with a natural language processing front- end and classification tree algorithm provide a dynamic framework for patient self-management of medications.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted at three districts (Quetta, Zhob and Killa Abdullah) of Balochistan, Pakistan. All childhood TB patients enrolled for treatment at Bolan Medical Complex Hospital (BMCH) Quetta and District Headquarter Hospitals of Zhob and Killa Abdullah from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018 were included in the study and followed until their treatment outcomes were reported. Data were collected through a purpose developed standardized data collection form and analyzed by using SPSS 20. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Out of 5152 TB patients enrolled at the study sites, 2184 (42.4%) were children. Among them, 1941 childhood TB patients had complete medical record were included in the study. Majority of the study participants were <5 years old (66.6%) and had pulmonary TB (PTB; 65%). A total of 45 (2.3%) patients were cured, 1680 (86.6%) completed treatment, 195 (10%) lost to follow-up, 15 (0.8%) died, 5 (0.3%) failed treatment and 1 (0.1%) was not evaluated for outcomes. In multivariate binary logistic regression analysis, treatment at BMCH Quetta (OR = 25.671, p-value < 0.001), rural residence (OR = 3.126, p-value < 0.001) and extra-PTB (OR = 1.619, p-value = 0.004) emerged as risk factors for unsuccessful outcomes.

267299,Floriculture and Covid-19,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo raised concerns regarding additional morbidity and mortality. Updating these indicators before a second wave is essential in order to prepare for additional help. METHODS: From mid-May to mid-December 2020, weekly surveys were undertaken in sampled streets from 10 health areas to quantify the use of barrier measures, and interview pedestrians about sickness and deaths in their households. Crude death rates (CDRs) were estimated. RESULTS: Minimal use or no use of face masks was observed in at least half of the streets. From May to December 2020, the number of suspected cases of COVID-19 increased six-fold (P < 0.05). Of deaths within 30 days preceding the interviews, 20% were considered to be related to COVID-19. The monthly CDRs at the beginning and end of the study were approximately 5 and 25 per 1000 population, respectively (P < 0.05); that is, annual CDRs of 60 and 260 per 1000 population, respectively. Thus, during the first wave, the estimated mortality rate increased by 50% compared with previous years, and increased at least four-fold by the end of 2020. CONCLUSION: Despite possible overestimations, the excess mortality in South Kivu is extremely concerning. This crisis calls for a rapid response and increased humanitarian assistance.","Écochard, René; Wimba, Patient; Bengehya, Justin; Katchunga, Philippe Bianga; Lugwarha, Séraphine; Oyimangirwe, Moise; Bazeboso, Jacques-Aimé; Tshilolo, Léon; Longo-Mbenza, Benjamin; Rabilloud, Muriel; Iwaz, Jean; Étard, Jean-François; Vanhems, Philippe",Int J Infect Dis,,585
267347,Editorial. Community practice in the time of COVID-19,2020,"As working for the nurse is believed to be one of the most stressful professions, nurses are particularly at risk of experiencing fatigue. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, fatigue among nurses may affect physical and mental health seriously, which is attracting increasing attention of researchers and clinical practitioners to find effective prevention measures to alleviate nurses' fatigue. This study aims to investigate the mediational effect of resilience on the relationship between nurses' perceived organizational support and fatigue. A total of 476 nurses from secondary and above hospitals in Hebei province, China during March and April in 2020, were investigated with Perceived Organizational Support Scale, Resilience Scale and Work Fatigue Inventory. Structural equation modeling was conducted to explore the mechanisms of nurses' perceived organizational support on fatigue. Results revealed that perceived organizational support can decrease the nurses' mental/physical/emotional fatigue through the mediating role of resilience. These findings guide for hospital managers to identify effective prevention strategies to alleviate the fatigue of clinical nurses.","Zhang, N.; Xu, D. X.; Li, J. J.; Gong, Z.

267433,Vehicular Networks for Combating a Worldwide Pandemic: Preventing the Spread of COVID-19,2020-10-15,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a new human disease with few effective treatments1. Convalescent plasma, donated by persons who have recovered from COVID-19, is the acellular component of blood that contains antibodies, including those that specifically recognize SARS-CoV-2. These antibodies, when transfused into patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, are thought to exert an antiviral effect, suppressing virus replication before patients have mounted their own humoral immune responses2,3. Virus-specific antibodies from recovered persons are often the first available therapy for an emerging infectious disease, a stopgap treatment while new antivirals and vaccines are being developed1,2. This retrospective, propensity score-matched case-control study assessed the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy in 39 patients with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Oxygen requirements on day 14 after transfusion worsened in 17.9% of plasma recipients versus 28.2% of propensity score-matched controls who were hospitalized with COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 0.86; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.75-0.98; chi-square test P value = 0.025). Survival also improved in plasma recipients (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 0.34; 95% CI, 0.13-0.89; chi-square test P = 0.027). Convalescent plasma is potentially effective against COVID-19, but adequately powered, randomized controlled trials are needed.","Liu, Sean T H; Lin, Hung-Mo; Baine, Ian; Wajnberg, Ania; Gumprecht, Jeffrey P; Rahman, Farah; Rodriguez, Denise; Tandon, Pranai; Bassily-Marcus, Adel; Bander, Jeffrey; Sanky, Charles; Dupper, Amy; Zheng, Allen; Nguyen, Freddy T; Amanat, Fatima; Stadlbauer, Daniel; Altman, Deena R; Chen, Benjamin K; Krammer, Florian; Mendu, Damodara Rao; Firpo-Betancourt, Adolfo; Levin, Matthew A; Bagiella, Emilia; Casadevall, Arturo; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; Jhang, Jeffrey S; Arinsburg, Suzanne A; Reich, David L; Aberg, Judith A; Bouvier, Nicole M",Nat Med,,585
267556,Anesthetic Considerations in a Patient With LVAD and COVID-19 Undergoing Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery,2020,"Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 was rapidly implemented in Portugal by the National Institute of Health in collaboration with a nationwide consortium of >50 hospitals/laboratories. Here, we track the geotemporal spread of a SARS-CoV-2 variant with a mutation (D839Y) in a potential host-interacting region involving the Spike fusion peptide, which is a target motif of anti-viral drugs that plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. The Spike Y839 variant was most likely imported from Italy in mid-late February and massively disseminated in Portugal during the early epidemic, becoming prevalent in the Northern and Central regions of Portugal where it represented 22% and 59% of the sampled genomes, respectively, by 30 April. Based on our high sequencing sampling during the early epidemics [15.5% (1275/8251) and 6.0% (1500/24987) of all confirmed cases until the end of March and April, respectively], we estimate that, between 14 March and 9 April (covering the epidemic exponential phase) the relative frequency of the Spike Y839 variant increased at a rate of 12.1% (6.1%-18.2%, CI 95%) every three days, being potentially associated with 24.8% (20.8-29.7%, CI 95%; 3177-4542 cases, CI 95%) of all COVID-19 cases in Portugal during this period. Our data supports population/epidemiological (founder) effects contributing to the Y839 variant superspread. The potential existence of selective advantage is also discussed, although experimental validation is required. Despite huge differences in genome sampling worldwide, SARS-CoV-2 Spike D839Y has been detected in 13 countries in four continents, supporting the need for close surveillance and functional assays of Spike variants.","Borges, Vítor; Isidro, Joana; Cortes-Martins, Helena; Duarte, Sílvia; Vieira, Luís; Leite, Ricardo; Gordo, Isabel; Caetano, Constantino P; Nunes, Baltazar; Sá, Regina; Oliveira, Ana; Guiomar, Raquel; Gomes, João Paulo",Emerg Microbes Infect,,585

Here we investigated whether women with PCOS are at an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Design: Population-based closed cohort study between 31 January 2020 and 22 July 2020 in the setting of a UK primary care database (The Health Improvement Network, THIN). Methods: The main outcome was the incidence of COVID-19 coded as suspected or confirmed by the primary care provider. We used Cox proportional hazards regression model with stepwise inclusion of explanatory variables (age, BMI, impaired glucose regulation, androgen excess, anovulation, vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease) to provide unadjusted and adjusted hazard risks (HR) of COVID-19 infection among women with PCOS compared to women without PCOS. Results: We identified 21 292 women with a coded diagnosis of PCO/PCOS and randomly selected 78 310 aged and general practice matched control women. The crude COVID-19 incidence was 18.1 and 11.9 per 1000 person-years among women with and without PCOS, respectively. Age-adjusted Cox regression analysis suggested a 51% higher risk of COVID-19 among women with PCOS compared to women without PCOS (HR: 1.51 (95% CI: 1.27-1.80), P < 0.001). After adjusting for age and BMI, HR reduced to 1.36 (1.14-1.63)], P = 0.001. In the fully adjusted model, women with PCOS had a 28% increased risk of COVID-19 (aHR: 1.28 (1.05-1.56), P = 0.015). Conclusion: Women with PCOS are at an increased risk of COVID-19 infection and should be specifically encouraged to adhere to infection control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Significance statement: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have an increased risk of cardio-metabolic disease, which have been identified as a risk factor for COVID-19. To investigate whether the increased metabolic risk in PCOS translates into an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, we carried out a population-based closed cohort study in the UK during its first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (January to July 2020), including 21 292 women with PCOS and 78 310 controls matched for sex, age and general practice location. Results revealed a 52% increased risk of COVID-19 infection in women with PCOS, which remained increased at 28% above controls after adjustment for age, BMI, impaired glucose regulation and other explanatory variables.","Subramanian, Anuradhaa; Anand, Astha; Adderley, Nicola J; Okoth, Kelvin; Toulis, Konstantinos A; Gokhale, Krishna; Sainsbury, Christopher; O039,; Reilly, Michael W; Arlt, Wiebke; Nirantharakumar, Krishnarajah",Eur J Endocrinol,,585

270117,Surgery during COVID-19 crisis conditions: can we protect our ethical integrity against the odds?,2020,"BackgroundVaccines for COVID-19 represent a breakthrough in the fight against the pandemic. However, worries about adverse effects have led to vaccine hesitancy in some people. On the other hand, as COVID-19 may be associated with a range of sequelae, it is possible that vaccines may protect against hospitalization and mortality of various diseases. MethodsWe leveraged a large prospective cohort, the UK-Biobank (UKBB), and studied associations of at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination (BioNTech BNT162b2 or Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) with hospitalization and mortalities from cardiovascular and other diseases (N=180,727). Multivariable Cox and Poisson regression was conducted controlling for main confounders. For hospitalizations, we also conducted separate analysis for new-onset and recurrent cases. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality were also included as outcome. ResultsWe observed that COVID-19 vaccination (at least one dose) was associated with lower risks of hospitalizations from stroke (hazard ratio [HR]=0.371, 95% CI: 0.254-0.543, p=3.36e-7), venous thromboembolism (VTE) (HR=0.485, 95% CI: 0.292-0.804, p=4.99e-3), dementia (HR=0.207, 95% CI 0.091-0.470; p=1.66e-4) and non-COVID-19 pneumonia (HR=0.482, 95% CI 0.313-0.742; p=9.18e-4). Regarding mortality, an association with lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was observed, as well as lower mortality from several diseases including stroke, coronary artery disease(CAD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and dementia. There is no evidence that vaccination was associated with increased hospitalization/fatality from any specific disorders. ConclusionsTaken together, this study provides further support to the safety and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination, and such benefits may extend beyond reduction of infection risk or severity per se. As an observational study, causal relationship cannot be concluded and further studies are required to verify the findings.","XIANG, Yong; FENG, Yaning; QIU, Jinghong; So, Hon-Cheong",,,585

270749,Researching a Pandemic: Letting COVID-19 Drive Our Research,2020,"COVID-19 associated coagulopathy is a dysfunction of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by significantly increased fibrinogen, D-dimer and C reactive protein and normal to near-normal prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and platelet count. Hypercoagulopathy and hypofibrinolysis coexist and are detected by viscoelastic tests. These features, when associated with immobilization and intrinsic risk factors (age, obesity, comorbidities, drugs) of the patient, can trigger thromboembolic events, despite thromboprophylaxis. The lungs are the first and most severely damaged organ. To date, most patients have exhibited hypercoagulability on viscoelastic tests not detected by standard coagulation tests. A high rate of thrombotic events was reported, suggesting that it should be considered as a cause of clinical deterioration in intensive care and potentially other clinical settings. In advanced stage, COVID-19 associated coagulopathy, fibrinogen and platelet count can decrease significantly, depending on the severity of clinical status resembling consumptive coagulopathy. In this stage, bleeding events can occur, especially if the patient is under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Viscoelastic tests are very useful tools to assess hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis (not detectable by standard coagulation tests) in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients with COVID-19 associated coagulopathy and look like very promising tools for anticoagulation management. However, further research needs to be carried out to determine whether abnormal viscoelastic tests alone or in combination with other clinical or laboratory findings can identify patients at increased thrombotic risk. Clinical trials to evaluate hypercoagulability using viscoelastic tests and the need for personalized dosage of anticoagulation in SARS-CoV-2 patientsare quickly emerging.","Rodrigues, Anabela; Seara Sevivas, Teresa; Leal Pereira, Carla; Caiado, André; Robalo Nunes, António",Acta med. port,,585

Constructing models that can generate scenarios for major assets to cover abrupt changes in financial markets is thus essential for the financial institution's risk management. Design/methodology/approach - The key issues in such modeling include how to manage the large number of risk factors involved, how to model the dynamics of chosen or derived factors and how to incorporate relations among these factors. The authors propose the orthogonal ARMA-GARCH (autoregressive movingaverage-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) approach to tackle these issues. The constructed economic scenario generation (ESG) models pass the backtests covering the period from the beginning of 2018 to the end of May 2020, which includes the turbulent situations caused by COVID-19. Findings - The backtesting covering the turbulent period of COVID-19, along with fan charts and comparisons on simulated and historical statistics, validates our approach. Originality/value - This paper is the first one that attempts to generate complex long-term economic scenarios for a large-scale portfolio from its large dimensional covariance matrix estimated by the orthogonal ARMA-GARCH model.","Lee, Y.

There is, however, great within-individual variation in how an animal perceives and reacts to stressors. These differences in coping with stress modulate the development of stress-induced memory alterations. The present study investigated whether and how chronic stress and individual emotionality interrelate and influence memory performances and brain neurogenesis in birds. For that, we used two lines of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) with divergent emotionality levels. Highly (E+) and less (E-) emotional quail were submitted to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) for 3 weeks and trained in a spatial task and a discrimination task, a form of cue-based memory. E + and E- birds were also used to assess the impact of CUS and emotionality on neurogenesis within the hippocampus and the striatum. CUS negatively impacted spatial memory, and cell proliferation, and survival in the hippocampus. High emotionality was associated with a decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. CUS improved discrimination performances and favored the differentiation of newborn cells into mature neurons in the striatum, specifically in E+ birds. Our results provide evidence that CUS consequences on memory and neural plasticity depends both on the memory system and individual differences in behavior.","Lormant, Flore; Ferreira, Vitor Hugo Bessa; Meurisse, Maryse; Lemarchand, Julie; Constantin, Paul; Morisse, Mélody; Cornilleau, Fabien; Parias, Céline; Chaillou, Elodie; Bertin, Aline; Lansade, Léa; Leterrier, Christine; Lévy, Frédéric; Calandreau, Ludovic",Sci Rep,,585
271396,Living the learning life in a time of COVID 19,2020,"In probabilistic nonadaptive group testing (PGT), we aim to characterize the number of pooled tests necessary to identify a random $k$-sparse vector of defectives with high probability. Recent work has shown that $n$ tests are necessary when $k =\omega(n/\log n)$. It is also known that $O(k \log n)$ tests are necessary and sufficient in other regimes. This leaves open the important sparsity regime where the probability of a defective item is $\sim 1/\log n$ (or $k = \Theta(n/\log n)$) where the number of tests required is linear in $n$. In this work we aim to exactly characterize the number of tests in this sparsity regime. In particular, we seek to determine the number of defectives $\lambda(\alpha)n / \log n$ that can be identified if the number of tests is $\alpha n$. In the process, we give upper and lower bounds on the exact point at which individual testing becomes suboptimal, and the use of a carefully constructed pooled test design is beneficial.","Flodin, Larkin; Mazumdar, Arya",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06878v1.pdf,585
271514,Tracking the global reduction of marine traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Background Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), such as telmisartan, have been postulated to treat Covid-19-induced lung inflammation. Methods This is a parallel-group, randomized, two-arm, open-label, adaptive, multicenter superiority trial with 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants included patients from 18 years of age hospitalized with Covid-19 with 4 or fewer days since symptom onset enrolled at a university and a community hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Exclusion criteria included prior intensive care unit (ICU) admission and use of ARBs/angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors at randomization. Control arm received standard care alone and treatment arm telmisartan 80 mg twice daily for 14 days. Primary outcomes were C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma levels at day 5 and 8 after randomization. Secondary outcomes included time to discharge within 15 days, admission to ICU and death at 15- and 30-days. NCT04355936 (Completed). Findings A pragmatic decision to end the study before the third interim analysis was made on Oct. 30th due to sharp reduction in recruitment. A total of 162 patients were randomized. 158 patients enrolled between May 14 and October 30 2020, were included in the analysis, 80 in the standard care and 78 in the telmisartan added to standard care group. Baseline absolute CRP serum levels were 5.53 ± 6.19 mg/dL (95% CI 6.91 to 4.15, n = 80) and 9.04 ± 7.69 (95% CI 9.04 to 10.82, n = 74) in the standard care and telmisartan added to standard care groups, respectively. Day 5 control-group CRP levels were 6.06 ± 6.95 mg/dL (95% CI 7.79–4.35, n = 66) while telmisartan group were 3.83 ± 5.08 mg/dL (95% CI 5.08–2.59, n = 66, p = 0.038). Day 8 CRP levels were 6.30 ± 8.19 mg/dL (95% CI 8.79–3.81, n = 44) and 2.37 ± 3.47 mg/dL (95% CI 3.44–1.30, n = 43, p = 0.0098) in the control and telmisartan groups, respectively (all values expressed as mean ± SD). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that telmisartan-treated patients had a lower median time-to-discharge (control=15 days;telmisartan=9 days). Death by day 30 was reduced in the telmisartan-treated group (control 22.54%, 16/71;telmisartan 4.29%, 3/70 participants;p = 0.0023). Composite ICU, mechanical ventilation or death was reduced by telmisartan treatment at days 15 and 30. No adverse events were reported. Interpretation Our study suggests that the ARB telmisartan, a widely used antihypertensive drug, is safe and could reduce morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients infected with SARS -CoV-2 by anti-inflammatory effects. Further studies employing telmisartan are needed for confirmation of our results and to define its true therapeutic value as a tool against Covid-19.","Duarte, Mariano Pelorosso Facundo Nicolosi Liliana N.; Victoria Salgado, M.; Vetulli, Héctor Aquieri Analía Azzato Francisco Castro Marcela Coyle Javier Davolos Ignacio Criado Ignacio Fernandez Gregori Rosana Mastrodonato Pedro Rubio María C.; Sarquis, Sergio Wahlmann Fernando Rothlin Rodolfo P.",EClinicalMedicine,,585
271769,"Dental education in the covid-19 era: Challenges, solutions and opportunities",2021,"Controlling the supramolecular self-assembly of &#960;-conjugated systems into defined morphologies is a prerequisite for the preparation of functional materials. In recent years, the development of sophisticated sample preparation protocols and modulation of various experimental conditions (solvent, concentration, temperature, etc.) have enabled precise control over aggregation pathways of different types of monomer units. A common method to achieve pathway control consists in the combination of two miscible solvents in defined proportions - a ""poor"" and ""good"" solvent. However, the role of solvents of opposed polarity in the self-assembly of a given building block still remains an open question. Herein, we unravel the effect of aggregation-inducing solvent systems of opposed polarity (aqueous vs. non-polar media) on the supramolecular assembly of a new bolaamphiphilic Pt(ii) complex. A number of experimental methods show a comparable molecular packing in both media driven by a synergy of solvophobic, aromatic and weak hydrogen-bonding interactions. However, morphological analysis of the respective aggregates in aqueous and non-polar media reveals a restricted aggregate growth in aqueous media into spherical nanoparticles and a non-restricted 2D-nanosheet formation in non-polar media. These findings are attributed to a considerably more efficient solvation and, in turn, increased steric demand of the hydrophilic chains in aqueous media than in nonpolar media, which can be explained by the entrapment of water molecules in the hydrophilic aggregate shell via hydrogen bonds. Our findings reveal that the different solvation of peripheral solubilizing groups in solvents of opposed polarity is an efficient method for morphology control in self-assembly.","Bäumer, Nils; Kartha, Kalathil K; Palakkal, Jasnamol P; Fernández, Gustavo",,,585

However, a decrease in the specificity of PCR assays for their targets may lead to false negative results. METHODS: Here, 177 high-coverage complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from 13 Brazilian states were aligned with 15 WHO recommended PCR assays. RESULTS: Only 3 of the 15 completely aligned to all Brazilian sequences. Ten assays had mismatches in up to 3 sequences and two in many sequences. CONCLUSION: These results should be taken into consideration when using PCR-based diagnostics in Brazil.","Santos, Renan da Silva; Bret, Raissa Souza Caminha; Moreira, Ana Cristina de Oliveira Monteiro; Campos, Adriana Rolim; Silva, Angelo Roncalli Alves E; Lima, Danielle Malta; Tavares, Kaio Cesar Simiano",Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,,585

Yet, the development of prevention strategies remains a challenging process, as epidemics are non-linear and complex processes. For this reason, we investigate a deep reinforcement learning approach to automatically learn prevention strategies in the context of pandemic influenza. Firstly, we construct a new epidemiological meta-population model, with 379 patches (one for each administrative district in Great Britain), that adequately captures the infection process of pandemic influenza. Our model balances complexity and computational efficiency such that the use of reinforcement learning techniques becomes attainable. Secondly, we set up a ground truth such that we can evaluate the performance of the 'Proximal Policy Optimization' algorithm to learn in a single district of this epidemiological model. Finally, we consider a large-scale problem, by conducting an experiment where we aim to learn a joint policy to control the districts in a community of 11 tightly coupled districts, for which no ground truth can be established. This experiment shows that deep reinforcement learning can be used to learn mitigation policies in complex epidemiological models with a large state space. Moreover, through this experiment, we demonstrate that there can be an advantage to consider collaboration between districts when designing prevention strategies.","Libin, Pieter; Moonens, Arno; Verstraeten, Timothy; Perez-Sanjines, Fabian; Hens, Niel; Lemey, Philippe; Now'e, Ann",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13676v1.pdf,585

272746,"Social inequalities and COVID-19 mortality in the city of São Paulo, Brazil",2021,"BACKGROUND: In patients with haematuria, a fast, noninvasive test with high sensitivity (SN) and negative predictive value (NPV), which is able to detect or exclude bladder cancer (BC), is needed. A newly developed urine assay, Xpert Bladder Cancer Detection (Xpert), measures five mRNA targets (ABL1, CRH, IGF2, UPK1B, and ANXA10) that are frequently overexpressed in BC. OBJECTIVE: To validate the performance of Xpert in patients with haematuria. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Voided precystoscopy urine specimens were prospectively collected at 22 sites from patients without prior BC undergoing cystoscopy for haematuria. Xpert, cytology, and UroVysion procedures were performed. Technical validation was performed and specificity (SP) was determined in patients without BC. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Test characteristics were calculated based on cystoscopy and histology results, and compared between Xpert, cytology, and UroVysion. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We included 828 patients (mean age 64.5 yr, 467 males, 401 never smoked). Xpert had an SN of 78% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 66-87) overall and 90% (95% CI: 76-96) for high-grade (HG) tumours. The NPV was 98% (95% CI: 97-99) overall. The SP was 84% (95% CI: 81-86). In patients with microhaematuria, only one HG patient was missed (NPV 99%). Xpert had higher SN and NPV than cytology and UroVysion. Cytology had the highest SP (97%). In a separate SP study, Xpert had an SP of 89% in patients with benign prostate hypertrophy and 92% in prostate cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Xpert is an easy-to-use, noninvasive test with improved SN and NPV compared with cytology and UroVysion, representing a promising tool for identifying haematuric patients with a low likelihood of BC who might not need to undergo cystoscopy. PATIENT SUMMARY: Xpert is an easy-to-perform urine test with good performance compared with standard urine tests. It should help identify (micro)haematuria patients with a very low likelihood to have bladder cancer.","Valenberg, Franciscus Johannes P van; Hiar, Andrew M; Wallace, Ellen; Bridge, Julia A; Mayne, Donna J; Beqaj, Safedin; Sexton, Wade J; Lotan, Yair; Weizer, Alon Z; Jansz, Godfrey K; Stenzl, Arnulf; Danella, John F; Cline, Kevin J; Williams, Michael B; Montgomery, Scott; David, Richard D; Harris, Richard; Klein, Eric W; Bradford, Timothy J; Wolk, Fred N; Westenfelder, Karl R; Trainer, Andrew F; Richardson, Timothy A; Egerdie, Russell B; Goldfarb, Bernard; Zadra, Joseph A; Lu, Xixi; Simon, Iris M; Campbell, Scott A; Bates, Michael P; Higuchi, Russell G; Witjes, J Alfred",,,585

Israel, similar to all other nations, was forced to cope with the unknown. ""Flattening the curve"" of infections has become a common term among specialists and decision makers, while explaining restricting measurements taken toward the population. Israelis, who had previously learned to deal with life under constant security threat, are now facing a new reality. The purpose of the study was to check how Israelis are psychologically affected by and coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. The study included 925 Israelis divided into three groups: ages 18-29, 30-59, and 60-88. The data were collected between March 31 and April 8, 2020, when it was already clear that this is a global plague, the country's borders were closed, and the government's directive for citizens was to remain at home while imposing limitations on the public and private sectors. The current study examined psychological distress among the three age groups as well as the associations between levels of distress, resilience, and coping strategies. Levels of distress were measured via the BSI-18 that measures anxiety, depression, and somatization. Resilience was measured using the Connor-Davidson CD-RISC scale. Coping was measured by the short version of the COPE. Psychological distress was associated with being in a younger age group, being a woman, having economic concerns, use of emotion and problem focused coping, and lower resilience. The study also found that concern for the health of family members was the strongest concern among all age groups but was highest among the younger age group. It was also found that those in the younger age group suffered from higher levels of depression, anxiety, and somatization compared to the older age group. The middle age group suffered from elevated levels of anxiety and somatization compared to the older age group. Although the older age group was the most vulnerable to the coronavirus, in this study age was found to be a protective factor from psychological distress. The results of the study suggest the need to consider the younger age group as a risk group, which hence needs to be addressed as the focus of intervention programs. It appears that the concern for their loved ones takes a heavy toll on the younger generation, and this should be considered a major source of stress.","Shechory Bitton, Mally; Laufer, Avital",Front Public Health,,585

Given the rapid increase of COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh, we aimed to translate and validate the FCV-19S in Bangla. The forward-backward translation method was used to translate the English version of the questionnaire into Bangla. The reliability and validity properties of the Bangla FCV-19S were rigorously psychometrically evaluated (utilizing both confirmatory factor analysis and Rasch analysis) in relation to socio-demographic variables, national lockdown variables, and response to the Bangla Health Patient Questionnaire. The sample comprised 8550 Bangladeshi participants. The Cronbach &#945; value for the Bangla FCV-19S was 0.871 indicating very good internal reliability. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed that the uni-dimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S fitted well with the data. The FCV-19S was significantly correlated with the nine-item Bangla Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-90) (r = 0.406, p < 0.001). FCV-19S scores were significantly associated with higher worries concerning lockdown. Measurement invariance of the FCV-19S showed no differences with respect to age or gender. The Bangla version of FCV-19S is a valid and reliable tool with robust psychometric properties which will be useful for researchers carrying out studies among the Bangla speaking population in assessing the psychological impact of fear from COVID-19 infection during this pandemic.","Sakib, Najmuj; Bhuiyan, A K M Israfil; Hossain, Sahadat; Al Mamun, Firoj; Hosen, Ismail; Abdullah, Abu Hasnat; Sarker, Md Abedin; Mohiuddin, Mohammad Sarif; Rayhan, Istihak; Hossain, Moazzem; Sikder, Md Tajuddin; Gozal, David; Muhit, Mohammad; Islam, S M Shariful; Griffiths, Mark D; Pakpour, Amir H; Mamun, Mohammed A",Int J Ment Health Addict,,585

We use data collected through an online survey with residents of Columbus, OH from April 30 to May 7, 2020. Employing multiple generalized estimating equations (GEEs) with a logit link function, we analyze the perceived risk of infection while traveling with different modes controlling for socio-demographics. The findings show that on average individuals are more likely to find shared modes (i.e., transit, ride-hailing, carsharing) riskier as compared to individual ones (i.e., walking, autos) when it comes to COVID-19 exposure. This study also suggests that the associations between perceptions related to exposure and various travel modes vary across groups with (1) different primary mode preferences (auto users vs non-auto users (e.g., transit users, bicyclists, etc.)), and (2) different socio-demographics. For example, auto users are more likely to find shared modes such as ride-hailing or transit riskier as compared to personal car. The conclusions present recommendations for future transportation policies in the post-COVID era. These include building upon the emerging positive perceptions towards non-motorized modes as an opportunity to promote sustainable transportation as well as formulating viable solutions to address the high-risk perceptions associated with transit.","Ozbilen, Basar; Slagle, Kristina M; Akar, Gulsah",Transp Res Interdiscip Perspect,,585

277591,Prognostic Nomogram on Admission Predicting Progression for Patients with Nonsevere COVID-19,2021,"The erector spinae plane block is a new regional anaesthesia technique that provides truncal anaesthesia for breast surgery. This systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to determine if the erector spinae plane block is effective at reducing pain scores and opioid consumption after breast surgery. This study also evaluated the outcomes of erector spinae plane blocks compared with other regional blocks. PubMed, Embase, Scopus, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched. We included randomised controlled trials reporting the use of the erector spinae plane block in adult breast surgery. Risk of bias was assessed with the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was used to assess trial quality. Thirteen randomised controlled trials (861 patients; 418 erector spinae plane block, 215 no blocks, 228 other blocks) were included. Erector spinae plane block reduced postoperative pain compared with no block: at 0-2 hours (mean difference (95% CI) -1.63 (-2.97 to -0.29), 6 studies, 329 patients, high-quality evidence, I2 = 98%, p = 0.02); at 6 hours (mean difference (95% CI) -0.90 (-1.49 to -0.30), 5 studies, 250 patients, high-quality evidence, I2 = 91%, p = 0.003); at 12 hours (mean difference (95% CI) -0.46 (-0.67 to -0.25), 5 studies, 250 patients, high-quality evidence, I2 = 58%, p < 0.0001); and at 24 hours (mean difference (95% CI) -0.50 (-0.70 to -0.30), 6 studies, 329 patients, high-quality evidence, I2 = 76%, p < 0.00001). Compared with no block, erector spinae plane block also showed significantly lower postoperative oral morphine equivalent requirements (mean difference (95% CI) -21.55mg (-32.57 to -10.52), 7 studies, 429 patients, high-quality evidence, I2 = 99%, p = 0.0001). Separate analysis of studies comparing erector spinae plane block with pectoralis nerve block and paravertebral block showed that its analgesic efficacy was inferior to pectoralis nerve block and similar to paravertebral block. The incidence of pneumothorax was 2.6% in the paravertebral block group; there were no reports of complications of the other blocks. This review has shown that the erector spinae plane block is more effective at reducing postoperative opioid consumption and pain scores up to 24 hours compared with general anaesthesia alone. However, it was inferior to the pectoralis nerve block and its efficacy was similar to paravertebral block. Further evidence, preferably from properly blinded trials, is required to confirm these findings.","Leong, R W; Tan, E S J; Wong, S N; Tan, K H; Liu, C W",Anaesthesia (Lond.),,585

High-risk patients with progressing symptomatic disease currently have only hospitalization treatment, with its high mortality, available to them. An outpatient treatment that prevents hospitalization is desperately needed. Two candidate medications have been widely discussed: remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) + azithromycin (AZ). Remdesivir has shown mild effectiveness in hospitalized inpatients, but no trials in outpatients have been registered. HCQ + AZ has been widely misrepresented in both clinical reports and public media, and results of outpatient trials are not expected until September. Early outpatient illness is very different from later florid disease requiring hospitalization, and the treatments differ. Evidence about use of HCQ alone, or of HCQ + AZ in inpatients, is irrelevant with regard to the efficacy of HCQ + AZ in early high-risk outpatient disease. Five studies, including 2 controlled clinical trials, have demonstrated significant major outpatient treatment efficacy. HCQ + AZ has been used as the standard of care in more than 300,000 older adults with multiple comorbid conditions; the estimated proportion of such patients diagnosed with cardiac arrhythmia attributable to the medications is 47 per 100,000 users, among whom estimated mortality is less than 20% (9/100,000 users), as compared with the 10,000 Americans now dying each week. These medications need to be made widely available and promoted immediately for physicians to prescribe.","Risch, Harvey A",Am J Epidemiol,,585

Artifact-free 120-300 s epoch lengths were visually identified and divided into 1 s windows with 10% overlap. Differential channels were grouped by frontal, parieto-occipital, and temporal lobes. For every channel and window, the power spectrum was calculated and used to compute the area for delta (0-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta (13-30 Hz) bands. Furthermore, Shannon's spectral entropy (SSE) and synchronization by Pearson's correlation coefficient () were computed; cases of patients diagnosed with either infectious toxic encephalopathy (ENC) or post-cardiorespiratory arrest (CRA) encephalopathy were used for comparison. Visual inspection of EEGs of COVID patients showed a near-physiological pattern with scarce anomalies. The distribution of EEG bands was different for the three groups, with COVID midway between distributions of ENC and CRA; specifically, temporal lobes showed different distribution for EEG bands in COVID patients. Besides, SSE was higher and hemispheric connectivity lower for COVID. We objectively identified some numerical EEG features in severely ill COVID patients that can allow positive diagnosis of this encephalopathy.","Pastor, Jesús; Vega-Zelaya, Lorena; Martín Abad, Elena",,,585
278229,Challenges of Equitable Vaccine Distribution in the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-11-24,"Migration and migrant movement are a global scenario, in which one of the main drivers, which facilitates migrant movement, is the search for better living conditions. One of the most vulnerable communities in this regard is migrant workers, especially in the developing world, who conduct cross-country migration. Labour migration is a significant national phenomenon in India in which the workers migrate across the states, which were facilitated by the interstate movement. The recent outbreak of pandemic COVID-19 poses the greatest challenge to the migrant workers who face the challenge of displacement due to the restriction of movement and public perception. One of the significant actors facilitating public discourse is the media, which explores the migrant scenario through framing. This article analyzes how the Indian newspaper portrays the plight of the migrant workers in Kerala through media framing using qualitative case analysis. The study reveals that the media frames portray the plight of the migrant workers during the pandemic situation, and the result could be helpful for policy developers on immigrant's integration. © 2021 Mykolas Riomeris University.

Direct assessment of &lt;italic&gt;T&lt;/italic&gt; core is often invasive, impractical on a large scale, and typically requires close contact between the observer and the target subject. Non-contact infrared thermometry (NCIT) represents a practical solution in which &lt;italic&gt;T&lt;/italic&gt; core can potentially be assessed from a safe distance and in mass screening scenarios, by measuring skin temperature at specific anatomical locations. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has clearly demonstrated that these devices are not being used correctly, despite expert guided specifications available in International Standard Organization (ISO) documents. In this review, we provide an overview of the most pertinent factors that should be considered by users of NCIT. This includes the most pertinent methodological and physiological factors, as well as an overview on the ability of NCIT to track human &lt;italic&gt;T&lt;/italic&gt; core. For practical use, we provide a checklist based on relevant ISO standards which are simple to follow and should be consulted prior to using NCIT for assessment of human &lt;italic&gt;T&lt;/italic&gt; core. Our intention is for users of NCIT to adopt this checklist, which may improve the performance of NCIT for its ability to track &lt;italic&gt;T&lt;/italic&gt; core.

278799,"Feminism, Pedagogy, and a Pandemic",2021,"BACKGROUND: Arterial stiffness is associated with myocardial ischemia and incident coronary artery disease (CAD), and indexes of arterial stiffness are usually increased in patients with CAD. However, these indexes are often increased in elderly without CAD. Arterial stiffness in patients with CAD may become more evident after isometric handgrip exercise which increases systolic pressure and ventricular afterload. We investigated the association of the change of stiffness indexes after isometric handgrip exercise with the lesion extent of CAD and the necessity for coronary revascularization. METHODS: Patients who were scheduled a routine coronary angiography via a femoral artery were enrolled. Arterial waveforms were traced at aortic root and external iliac artery using coronary catheters at baseline and 3 min after handgrip exercise. Augmentation index (AIx) was measured on the recorded aortic pressure waveform, and pulse wave velocity (PWV) was calculated using the ECG-gated time difference of the upstroke of arterial waveforms and distance between aortic root and external iliac artery. RESULTS: Total 37 patients were evaluated. Both PWV and AIx increased after handgrip exercise. &#916;PWV was significantly correlated with &#916;AIx (r = 0.344, P = 0.037). Patients were divided into higher and lower &#916;PWV or &#916;AIx groups based on the median values of 0.4 m/sec and 3.3%, respectively. Patients with higher PWV had more 2- or 3-vessel CAD (69% vs. 27%, P = 0.034), and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) more frequently (84% vs. 50%, P = 0.038), but higher &#916;AIx was not associated with either the lesion extent or PCI. Area under curve (AUC) of &#916;PWV in association with PCI by C-statistics was 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.88; P = 0.056). In multiple logistic regression analysis, &#916;PWV was significantly associated with PCI (odds ratio 7.78; 95% CI 1.26-48.02; P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Higher &#916;PWV after isometric handgrip exercise was associated with the lesion extent of CAD and the necessity for coronary revascularization, but higher &#916;AIx was not.","Kim, Seong Taeg; Ko, Yeekyoung; Beom, Jong-Wook; Boo, Ki Yung; Lee, Jae-Geun; Choi, Joon-Hyouk; Kim, Song-Yi; Joo, Seung-Jae",Clin Hypertens,,585

Vaccines have saved millions of lives since their introduction to the public over 200 years ago. The potential for vaccination reached new heights in the mid-20th century with the development of technologies that expanded the ability to create novel vaccines. Since then, there has been continued technological advancement in vaccine development. The resulting platforms provide the promise for solutions for many infectious diseases, including those that have been with us for decades as well as those just now emerging. Each vaccine platform represents a different technology with a unique set of advantages and challenges, especially when considering manufacturing. Therefore, it is essential to understand each platform as a separate product and process with its specific quality considerations. This review outlines the relevant platforms for developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each.","Verdecia, Mark; Kokai-Kun, John F; Kibbey, Maura; Acharya, Sarita; Venema, Jaap; Atouf, Fouad",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,585

We investigated admission rates, treatment and mortality of BAME with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during COVID-19. METHODS: Using multisource national healthcare records, patients hospitalised with AMI in England during 1 February-27 May 2020 were included in the COVID-19 group, whereas patients admitted during the same period in the previous three consecutive years were included in a pre-COVID-19 group. Multilevel hierarchical regression analyses were used to quantify the changes in-hospital and 7-day mortality in BAME compared with whites. RESULTS: Of 73 746 patients, higher proportions of BAME patients (16.7% vs 10.1%) were hospitalised with AMI during the COVID-19 period compared with pre-COVID-19. BAME patients admitted during the COVID-19 period were younger, male and likely to present with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction. COVID-19 BAME group admitted with non-ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction less frequently received coronary angiography (86.1% vs 90.0%, p<0.001) and had a longer median delay to reperfusion (4.1 hours vs 3.7 hours, p<0.001) compared with whites. BAME had higher in-hospital (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.28) and 7-day mortality (OR 1.81 95% CI 1.31 to 2.19) during COVID-19 compared with pre-COVID-19 period. CONCLUSION: In this multisource linked cohort study, compared with whites, BAME patients had proportionally higher hospitalisation rates with AMI, less frequently received guidelines indicated care and had higher early mortality during COVID-19 period compared with pre-COVID-19 period. There is a need to develop clinical pathways to achieve equity in the management of these vulnerable populations.","Rashid, Muhammad; Timmis, Adam; Kinnaird, Tim; Curzen, Nick; Zaman, Azfar; Shoaib, Ahmad; Mohamed, Mohamed O; de Belder, Mark A; Deanfield, John; Martin, Glen Philip; Wu, Jianhua; Gale, Chris P; Mamas, Mamas",Heart,,585

280602,O Anestesiologista e a COVID­19./ [The Anesthesiologist and COVID-19],2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The COVID-19 spreads rapidly around the world which has brought a global health crisis. The pathogen of COVID-19 is SARS-COV-2, and previous studies have proposed the relationship between ABO blood group and coronavirus. Here, we aim to delve into the association between ABO blood group and COVID-19 infection, severity and demise. METHODS: The relevant studies were retrieved from five databases: PubMed, MedRxiv, BioRxiv,Web of Science and CNKI. Members of cases(symptomatic cases, severe cases, died cases) and controls(asymptomatic controls, non-severe controls, alive controls) were extracted from collected studies. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and interpreted from extracted data. Publication bias and sensitivity analysis were also applied to confirm our discovery. RESULTS: Overall 31,100 samples were included in the analysis. Compared to other ABO blood type, an increased odds of infecting COVID-19 among individuals with A blood group (OR: 1.249, 95%CI: 1.114-1.440, P < 0.001) and a decreased odds of infecting COVID-19 among individuals with blood group O (OR: 0.699, 95%CI: 0.635-0.770, P < 0.001) were found. Besides, individuals with blood group AB seems to link a higher risk to COVID-19 severity (OR: 2.424, 95%CI: 0.934-6.294) and demise (OR: 1.348, 95%CI: 0.507-3.583). Meantime, individuals with O blood group might had lower risk to COVID-19 severity (OR: 0.748, 95%CI: 0.556-1.007), and individuals with B blood group were likely to relate a lower risk to COVID-19 demise. CONCLUSIONS: The current meta-analysis suggest that blood type A might be more susceptible to infect COVID-19 while blood type O might be less susceptible to infect COVID-19; there were no correlation between ABO blood group and severity or demise of COVID-19. However, more investigation and research are warranted to clarify the relationship between COVID-19 and ABO blood type.","Wu, Bing-Bing; Gu, Dong-Zhou; Yu, Jia-Ning; Yang, Jie; Shen, Wang-Qin",Infect Genet Evol,,585

In an AMC, donors commit to a fund from which a specified subsidy is paid per unit purchased by low-income countries until the fund is exhausted, strengthening suppliers' incentives to invest in research, development, and capacity. Last decade saw the launch of a $1.5 billion pilot AMC to distribute pneumococcal vaccine to the developing world;in the current pandemic, variations on AMCs are being used to fund Covid-19 vaccines. This paper undertakes the first formal analysis of AMCs. We construct a model in which an altruistic donor negotiates on behalf of a low-income country with a vaccine supplier after the supplier has sunk investments. We use this model to explain the logic of an AMC-as a solution to a hold-up problem-and to analyze alternative design features under various economic conditions (cost uncertainty, supplier competition). A key finding is that optimal AMC design differs markedly depending on where the product is in its development cycle.","Kremer, M.; Snyder, C. M.; Levin, J.

Older age, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and obesity significantly increase morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. In the present review we summarize the existing, and daily growing, data on the impact of COVID-19 infection on patients with diabetes, their antidiabetic therapy as well as the extra precautions, apart from good glucose control, they have to take in order not to contract the virus. Social distancing and strict hand hygiene are of great importance in order to help the global goal of eradication of the disease.","Papazafiropoulou, Athanasia K; Antonopoulos, Stavros",Arch Med Sci Atheroscler Dis,,585
281821,[Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in a single center of Argentina. Retrospective cohort],2020,"Abstract While the harmonisation of insolvency law in the European Union (EU) has been a top priority on the European institutions' agenda in the last decade, it is well known that this endeavour has been slow and has often met resistance from the Member States. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed that top-down harmonisation of insolvency (i.e., introduced at EU level) has been temporarily halted. The urgency to control or mitigate the economically and financially destructive effects of the pandemic has, nevertheless, forced European governments to adopt domestic strategies and laws in the area of insolvency. Interestingly, however, such measures show that insolvency and restructuring law responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, albeit largely uncoordinated, reflect a phenomenon of bottom-up harmonisation (i.e., introduced by Member States) indicating a convergence towards common approaches. This paper interrogates the insolvency law responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in six European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom). It uncovers the inadequacy of the EU's harmonisation language, and the limits of harmonisation strategies in insolvency and restructuring law. Finally, it promotes the formulation of a wider-encompassing definition of ?legal harmonisation?.","Ghio, Emilie Boon Gert-Jan Ehmke David Gant Jennifer Langkjaer Line Vaccari Eugenio",International Insolvency Review,,585
281837,Care profile of susceptible patients with osteoporosis by telemedicine visits in the post-COVID-19 era,2021,"We focus on the modeling and simulation of an infectious disease spreading in a medium size population occupying a confined environment, such as an airport terminal, for short periods of time. Because of the size of the crowd and venue, we opt for a kinetic type model. The paper is divided into two parts. In the first part, we adopt the simplifying assumption that people's walking speed and direction are given. The resulting kinetic model features a variable that denotes the level of exposure to people spreading the disease, a parameter describing the contagion interaction strength, and a kernel function that is a decreasing function of the distance between a person and a spreading individual. Such model is tested on problems involving a small crowd in a square walkable domain. In the second part, ideas from the simplified model are used to incorporate disease spreading in a kinetic theory approach for crowd dynamics, i.e. the walking speed and direction result from interaction with other people and the venue.","Kim, Daewa; Quaini, Annalisa",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.11401v1.pdf,585

With different control policies from local and state government, the COVID-19 outbreak has dramatically changed mobility behavior in affected cities. This study has been investigating the impact of COVID-19 on the number of people involved in crashes accounting for the intensity of different control measures using Negative Binomial (NB) method. Based on a comprehensive dataset of people involved in crashes aggregated in New York City during January 1, 2020 to May 24, 2020, people involved in crashes with respect to travel behavior, traffic characteristics and socio-demographic characteristics are found. The results show that the average person miles traveled on the main traffic mode per person per day, percentage of work trip have positive effect on person involved in crashes. On the contrary, unemployment rate and inflation rate have negative effects on person involved in crashes. Interestingly, different level of control policies during COVID-19 outbreak are closely associated with safety awareness, driving and travel behavior, and thus has an indirect influence on the frequency of crashes. Comparing to other three control policies including emergence declare, limits on mass gatherings, and ban on all nonessential gathering, the negative relationship between stay-at-home policy implemented in New York City from March 20, 2020 and the number of people involved crashes is found in our study.","Zhang, Jie; Feng, Baoheng; Wu, Yina; Xu, Pengpeng; Ke, Ruimin; Dong, Ni",PLoS One,,585

282281,"Letters from the pandemic: Nursing student narratives of change, challenges and thriving at the outset of COVID-19",2021,"BACKGROUND: As serologic assays for SARS-CoV-2 become more widely utilized, it is important to understand their performance characteristics and correlation with neutralizing antibodies. We evaluated three commonly used SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays (Abbott, DiaSorin and EUROIMMUN) for clinical sensitivity, specificity, and correlation with neutralizing antibodies and then compared antibody kinetics during the acute phase of infection. METHODS: Three panels of samples were tested on every assay. Sensitivity was assessed using a panel of 35 specimens serially collected from 7 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Specificity was determined using 100 sera samples collected in 2018 from healthy individuals prior to the outbreak. Analytical specificity was determined using a panel of 37 samples from individuals with respiratory illnesses other than COVID-19. RESULTS: Clinical sensitivity was 91.43% (95% CI 76.94%-98.20%) for Abbott, and 88.57% (95% CI 73.26%-96.80%) for both DiaSorin and EUROIMMUN. Clinical specificity was 99.00% (95% CI 94.55%-99.97%) for Abbott and DiaSorin and 94.00% (95% CI 87.40%-97.77%) for EUROIMMUN. The IgG assays demonstrated good qualitative agreement (minimum of 94%) and good correlation between the quantitative result for each combination of assays (r2&#8805;0.90). The neutralizing antibody response did not necessarily follow the same temporal kinetics as the IgG response and did not necessarily correlate with IgG values. CONCLUSION: The three IgG antibody assays demonstrated comparable performance characteristics. Importantly, a qualitative positive IgG result obtained with any of the assays was associated with the presence of neutralizing antibodies; however, neutralizing antibody concentrations did not correlate well with signal to cutoff ratios.","Rychert, Jenna; Couturier, Marc Roger; Elgort, Marc; Lozier, Bucky Ken; La039,; ulu, Sonia; Genzen, Jonathan R; Straseski, Joely A; Delgado, Julio C; Slev, Patricia R",,,585

A case-based review was performed to present real-life experiences in terms of main findings and treatment options. We described two cases with the diagnosis of MIS and searched the literature to review all reported &#8805; 18-year-old cases. The PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched. All relevant articles from January 2020 to February 2021 were reviewed. An adolescent and an adult patient (18 and 40 years-old, respectively) with the diagnosis of MIS were presented. Both had the consistent clinical findings with the case definition criteria. Although steroid, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and supportive care treatments have been suggested in the literature, there exists no treatment guideline for MIS-A. The clinical and laboratory findings of the patients progressively improved with the implementation of the IVIG and the pulse steroid treatments. A total of 51 cases (&#8805; 18 years-old) with MIS were analyzed. Mean age was 29.4 ± 10 years. Fever (80.4%), gastrointestinal (72.5%), and respiratory symptoms (54.9%) were the predominant symptoms. Cardiovascular abnormalities were the most frequent reported findings (82.4%, 42/51). The dermatological and conjunctival findings were reported in 39.2% and 35.3% of the patients, respectively. The increased level of inflammatory biomarkers was remarkable. Most of the patients were treated successfully with steroid and IVIG. Clinicians managing adult patients should keep in mind the development risk of MIS related with SARS-CoV-2 infection to perform necessary interventions properly without delay. IVIG and pulse steroid treatments are the effective options on clinical improvement.","Bastug, Aliye; Aslaner, Halide; Aybar Bilir, Yesim; Kemirtlek, Nizamettin; Gursoy, Fahriye Melis; Bastug, Serdal; Bodur, Hurrem",Rheumatol Int,,585

Germany relies largely on migrant caregivers from Poland. Yet the pandemic-related mobility restrictions reveal the deficiencies of this transnational elder care system. This article asks if this system is resilient. In order to answer this question, the research team conducted interviews with 10 experts and randomly selected representatives of brokering and sending agencies in Germany and Poland. We interviewed 13 agencies in Germany and 15 in Poland on the agencies' characteristics, recruitment strategies, challenges of the pandemic, and impact of legal regulations in the sector. The analysis shows that the system could mobilize adaptive capacities and continue to deliver services, but its absorptive capacity is limited. To enhance resilience, policies working toward formalization and legalization of care services across national borders are required.","Nowicka, Magdalena; Bartig, Susanne; Schwass, Theresa; Matuszczyk, Kamil",J Aging Soc Policy,,585

We here described the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of 37 recovered COVID-19 patients with prolonged presence of viral RNA in Wuhan, China. For those who had been discharged and re-admitted, their close contacts outside the hospital were traced and evaluated. The median age of the 37 patients was 62 years (IQR 50, 68), and 24 (64.9%) were men. They had common or severe COVID-19. With prolonged positive RT-PCR, most patients were clinically stable, 29 (78.4%) denied any symptoms. A total of 431 PCR tests were carried out, with each patient at a median of 8 time points. The median time of PCR positivity to April 18 was 78 days (IQR 67.7, 84.5), and the longest 120 days. 22 of 37 patients had been discharged at a median of 44 days (IQR 22.3, 50) from disease onset, and 9 had lived with their families without personal protections for a total of 258 person-days and no secondary infection was identified through epidemiological investigation, nucleic acid and antibody screening. Infectiousness in COVID-19 patients with prolonged presence of viral nucleic acid should not solely be evaluated by RT-PCR. Those patients who have clinically recovered and whose disease course has exceeded four weeks were associated with very limited infectiousness.

Particularly vulnerable households include dual health care professional households, single-parent health care professional households, and households with health care professionals responsible for a high-risk family member (i.e., an older adult or immunocompromised person). While the demographics of these households are heterogeneous, it is expected that the professional and personal concerns specific to COVID-19 will be similar. These concerns include family safety, balancing full-time work with home-based schooling for children, the looming threat of illness to one or both partners, the potential of infecting high-risk family members, and the challenges of planning for the future during uncertain times. To elucidate these concerns in their department, the authors sought input from colleagues in dual health care professional households through an open-ended email communication. Respondents expressed a range of concerns centered on balancing professional and family responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this commentary, the authors propose several recommendations in the areas of support networks, leadership and culture, and operations and logistics that health care institutions can adopt to minimize the burden on these vulnerable households during states of emergency. The successful implementation of these recommendations hinges on creating a work environment in which all health care providers feel comfortable voicing their concerns.","Donroe, Joseph H; Rabin, Tracy L; Hsieh, Evelyn; Schwartz, Jeremy I",Acad. med,,585

Existing labor-intensive public health workflows may benefit from information collection directly from individuals through patient-reported outcomes (PROs) systems. Our objective was to develop a reusable, mobile-friendly application for collecting PROs and experiences to support COVID-19 symptom self-monitoring and data sharing with appropriate public health agencies, using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) for interoperability. We conducted a needs assessment and designed and developed StayHome, a mobile PRO administration tool. FHIR serves as the primary data model and driver of business logic. Keycloak, AWS, Docker, and other technologies were used for deployment. Several FHIR modules were used to create a novel ""FHIR-native"" application design. By leveraging FHIR to shape not only the interface strategy but also the information architecture of the application, StayHome enables the consistent standards-based representation of data and reduces the barrier to integration with public health information systems. FHIR supported rapid application development by providing a domain-appropriate data model and tooling. FHIR modules and implementation guides were referenced in design and implementation. However, there are gaps in the FHIR specification which must be recognized and addressed appropriately. StayHome is live and accessible to the public at https://stayhome.app. The code and resources required to build and deploy the application are available from https://github.com/uwcirg/stayhome-project.","Burkhardt, H.

In this study, both strain improvements and fermentation process strategies were applied to achieve high-level D-PA production in Escherichia coli. First, a D-PA-producing strain was developed through deletion of the aceF and mdh genes combined with the overexpression of the gene ppnk. The obtained engineered E. coli DPA02/pT-ppnk accumulated 6.89 ± 0.11 g/L of D-PA in shake flask fermentation, which was 79.9 % higher than the control strain. Moreover, the cultivation process contributed greatly to D-PA production with respect to titer and productivity by betaine supplementation and dissolved oxygen (DO)-feedback feeding framework. Under optimal conditions, 68.3 g/L of D-PA, the specific productivity of 0.794 g/L h and the yield of 0.36 g/g glucose in 5 L fermenter were achieved.

284516,Centering Loss and Grief: Positioning Schools as Sites of Collective Healing in the Era of COVID-19,2021,"Background: COVID-19 is responsible for increasing deaths globally As most people dying with COVID-19 are older with underlying long-term conditions (LTCs), some speculate that YLL are low We aim to estimate YLL attributable to COVID-19, before and after adjustment for number/type of LTCs, using the limited data available early in the pandemic Methods: We first estimated YLL from COVID-19 using WHO life tables, based on published age/sex data from COVID-19 deaths in Italy We then used aggregate data on number/type of LTCs in a Bayesian model to estimate likely combinations of LTCs among people dying with COVID-19 We used routine UK healthcare data from Scotland and Wales to estimate life expectancy based on age/sex/these combinations of LTCs using Gompertz models from which we then estimate YLL Results: Using the standard WHO life tables, YLL per COVID-19 death was 14 for men and 12 for women After adjustment for number and type of LTCs, the mean YLL was slightly lower, but remained high (11 6 and 9 4 years for men and women, respectively) The number and type of LTCs led to wide variability in the estimated YLL at a given age (e g at ≥80 years, YLL was &gt;10 years for people with 0 LTCs, and &lt;3 years for people with ≥6) Conclusions: Deaths from COVID-19 represent a substantial burden in terms of per-person YLL, more than a decade, even after adjusting for the typical number and type of LTCs found in people dying of COVID-19 The extent of multimorbidity heavily influences the estimated YLL at a given age More comprehensive and standardised collection of data (including LTC type, severity, and potential confounders such as socioeconomic-deprivation and care-home status) is needed to optimise YLL estimates for specific populations, and to understand the global burden of COVID-19, and guide policy-making and interventions © 2021 Hanlon P et al","McAllister, D.

This study developed and validated a scale to measure health care system distrust and to examine the psychometric properties of the scale. METHODS: Interviews, expert reviews, a pilot test, and a cross-sectional survey with 884 Koreans were conducted for instrument development and validation. Content validity, construct validity using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, convergent and discriminant validity, and reliability of the scale were examined. RESULTS: Factor analyses demonstrated a three-factor structure (competency of tests and health care providers, quality of health care organizations, and honesty of health care organizations) of the Health Care System Distrust scale with 12 items accounting for a total of 71.47% of the variance (competency = 33.35%, quality = 21.14%, and honesty = 16.97%). Cronbach's &#945; coefficients of the subscales were 0.72-0.92. CONCLUSION: The newly developed Health Care System Distrust scale will aid in understanding Koreans' distrust of the health care system and their cancer screening behaviors, and will improve cancer screening utilization by transforming distrust into trust.","Lee, Shin-Young",Public health nurs,,585

To continue professional education during this crisis, an alternative is conducting online conferences with live streaming and an audience interaction platform. OBJECTIVE: The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has affected human connection globally. Conventional conferences have been replaced by online conferences. However, online conferencing has its challenges and limitations. This manuscript reports the logistics and preparations required for converting an international onsite multidisciplinary conference into a completely online conference within 3 weeks during this pandemic. METHODS: The program was revised, and teleconference system, live recording, director system setup, and broadcast platform were arranged to enable the online conference. RESULTS: We used YouTube and WeChat for the online conference. Of the 24 hours of the conventional conference, 21.5 hours were retained in the online conference (90%) with live broadcasting. The conference was attended by 71% (37/52) of the original international faculty and 71% (27/38) of the overall faculty. In total, 61 out of 66 presentations (92% of the original number) were delivered. A special session ""Dialysis access management under the impact of viral epidemics"" was added to replace precongress workshops and competitions. The conference received 1810, 1452, and 1008 visits on YouTube and 6777, 4623, and 3100 visits on WeChat on days 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

285563,COVID-19: the great unequaliser,2020,"Pollution with microplastics has become an environmental concern worldwide. Yet, little information is available on the distribution of microplastics in lakes. Lake Ziway is one of the largest lakes in Ethiopia and is known for its fishing and drinking water supply. This study aims to examine the distribution of plastic particles, of all sizes (micro- and small macro-plastics) in four of the major fish species of the lake and in its shoreline sediment. The gastrointestinal tracts analysis showed that 35% of the sampled fishes ingested plastic particles. The median number of particles per fish was 4 (range 1-26). Benthic (Clarias gariepinus) and benthopelagic (Cyprinus carpio and Carassius carassius) fish species were found to contain a significantly higher number of plastic particles in comparison to the planktivorous fish species (Oreochromis niloticus). More fishes ingested plastic particles in the wet compared to the dry season. The maximum plastic size (40 mm fibre) was found in C. carpio. Estimated median mass of plastic particles in fish was 0.07 (0.0002-385.2) mg/kg_ww. Fish and sediment samples close to known potential sources of plastic particles had a higher plastic ingestion frequency (52% of the fish) and higher plastic concentration compared to the other parts of the lake. The median count and mass of plastic particles measured in sediment of the lake were 30,000 (400-124,000) particles/m3 and 764 (0.05-36,233) mg/kg_dw, respectively, the upper limits of which exceed known effect thresholds. Attenuated total reflection (ATR) - Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed that polypropylene, polyethylene and alkyd-varnish were the dominant polymers in fishes and in sediment. The plastic particles size distributions were Log-linear and were identical for plastic particles found in fish and in sediment, suggesting strong benthic-pelagic coupling of plastic particles transfer.","Merga, Lemessa B; Redondo-Hasselerharm, Paula E; Van den Brink, Paul J; Koelmans, Albert A",Sci Total Environ,,585

We perform an ordinary least squares regression to investigate the relationship between the sentiment about WFH and user characteristics including gender, age, ethnicity, median household income, and population density. To better understand public opinion, we use latent Dirichlet allocation to extract topics and discover how tweet contents relate to people's attitudes. These findings provide evidence that sentiment about WFH varies across user characteristics. Furthermore, the content analysis sheds light on the nuanced differences in sentiment and reveals disparities relate to WFH.","Xiong, Ziyu; Li, Pin; Lyu, Hanjia; Luo, Jiebo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06762v3.pdf,585

As a convergence science, tissue engineering has traditionally focused on the application of engineering principles to biological systems, collaboration across disciplines, and rapid translation of technologies from the benchtop to the bedside. Given these strengths, tissue engineers are particularly well suited to apply their skill set to the current crisis and viral outbreaks in general. This work introduces the basics of virology and epidemiology for tissue engineers, and highlights important developments in the field of tissue engineering relevant to the current pandemic, including in vitro model systems, vaccine technology, and small-molecule drug delivery. COVID-19 serves as a call to arms for scientists across all disciplines, and tissue engineers are well trained to be leaders and contributors in this time of need. Impact statement Given the steep mortality caused by the recent novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, there is clear need for advances in diagnostics and therapeutics for viral outbreaks. Tissue engineering has the potential for critical impact on clinical outcomes in viral outbreaks. Tissue engineers, if mobilized, could play key roles as leaders in the outbreak, given their ability to apply engineering principles to biological processes, experience in collaborative environments, and penchant for technological translation from benchtop to bedside. In this work, three areas pioneered by tissue engineers that could be applied to the current COVID-19 crisis and future viral outbreaks are highlighted.","Tatara, Alexander M",Tissue Eng Part A,,585

The impact of COVID-19 in first trimester pregnancy remains poorly understood. Moreover, how long SARS-CoV-2 can survive in placenta is unknown. Herein we report a case of a pregnant woman in the first trimester who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at 8 weeks of gestation although her clinical course was asymptomatic. At 13 weeks of gestation, her throat swab tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 but viral RNA was detected in the placenta and the Spike (S) proteins (S1 and S2) were immunolocalized in cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast cells of the placental villi. Histologically, the villi were generally avascular with peri-villus fibrin deposition and in some areas the syncytiotrophoblast layer appeared lysed. The decidua also had fibrin deposition with extensive leucocyte infiltration suggestive of inflammation. The SARS-CoV-2 crossed the placental barrier, as the viral RNA was detected in the amniotic fluid and the S proteins were detected in the fetal membrane. Ultrasonography revealed extensively subcutaneous edema with pleural effusion suggestive of hydrops fetalis and the absence of cardiac activity indicated fetal demise. This is the first study to provide concrete evidence of persistent placental infection of SARS-CoV-2 and its congenital transmission associated with hydrops fetalis and intrauterine fetal demise in early pregnancy.","Shende, Prajakta; Gaikwad, Pradip; Gandhewar, Manisha; Ukey, Pawankumar; Bhide, Anshul; Patel, Vainav; Bhagat, Sharad; Bhor, Vikrant; Mahale, Smita; Gajbhiye, Rahul; Modi, Deepak",Hum. reprod,,585

The first and most draconian interventions have been implemented in Wuhan, China, and these countermeasures have been increasingly deployed by countries around the world. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine risk factors, including the use of social media, for probable anxiety and depression in the community and among health professionals in the epicenter, Wuhan, China. METHODS: We conducted an online survey via WeChat, the most widely used social media platform in China, which was administered to 1577 community-based adults and 214 health professionals in Wuhan. Probable anxiety and probable depression were assessed by the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (cutoff &#8805;3) and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (cutoff &#8805;3), respectively. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with probable anxiety and probable depression. RESULTS: Of the 1577 community-based adults, about one-fifth of respondents reported probable anxiety (n=376, 23.84%, 95% CI 21.8-26.0) and probable depression (n=303, 19.21%, 95% CI 17.3-21.2). Similarly, of the 214 health professionals, about one-fifth of surveyed health professionals reported probable anxiety (n=47, 22.0%, 95% CI 16.6-28.1) or probable depression (n=41, 19.2%, 95% CI 14.1-25.1). Around one-third of community-based adults and health professionals spent &#8805;2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media. Close contact with individuals with COVID-19 and spending &#8805;2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media were associated with probable anxiety and depression in community-based adults. Social support was associated with less probable anxiety and depression in both health professionals and community-based adults. CONCLUSIONS: The internet could be harnessed for telemedicine and restoring daily routines, yet caution is warranted toward spending excessive time searching for COVID-19 news on social media given the infodemic and emotional contagion through online social networks. Online platforms may be used to monitor the toll of the pandemic on mental health.","Ni, Michael Y; Yang, Lin; Leung, Candi M C; Li, Na; Yao, Xiaoxin I; Wang, Yishan; Leung, Gabriel M; Cowling, Benjamin J; Liao, Qiuyan",JMIR Ment Health,,585

On 10 March, the first case of COVID-19 pneumonia was admitted to Hvidovre Hospital. METHODS: Retrospective case review of individuals 18 years or older who were admitted consecutively to Hvidovre Hospital from 10 March through 23 April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 175 individuals were admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia. The median age was 71 years, 48.6% were male and 71% had at least one co-morbidity. The most commonly presenting symptoms were dyspnoea, dry cough, and fever. The majority of patients had lymphopenia, elevated liver function tests and C-reactive protein. Nearly two in three presented with multilobar infiltration by chest X-ray. Respiratory failure leading to invasive mechanical ventilation developed in 27 patients (15.4%).

The present study aims to estimate the risk factors for hospitalization and death in the Mexican population infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used the publicly available data released by the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Diseases of the Mexican Ministry of Health (Secretaría de Salud, SSA). All records of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases were included. Two multiple logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the association between hospitalization and mortality, with other covariables. Data on 10,544 individuals (57.68% men), with mean age 46.47±15.62, were analyzed. Men were about 1.54 times more likely to be hospitalized than women (p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.37-1.74); individuals aged 50-74 and &#8805;74 were more likely to be hospitalized than people aged 25-49 (OR 2.05, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.81-2.32, and OR 3.84, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.90-5.15, respectively). People with hypertension, obesity, and diabetes were more likely to be hospitalized than people without these comorbidities (p<0.01). Men had more risk of death in comparison to women (OR = 1.53, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.30-1.81) and individuals aged 50-74 and &#8805;75 were more likely to die than people aged 25-49 (OR 1.96, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.63-2.34, and OR 3.74, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.80-4.98, respectively). Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes presented in combination conveyed a higher risk of dying in comparison to not having these diseases (OR = 2.10; p<0.001, 95% C.I. 1.50-2.93). Hospitalization, intubation and pneumonia entail a higher risk of dying (OR 5.02, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 3.88-6.50; OR 4.27, p<0.001, 95% C.I. 3.26-5.59, and OR = 2.57; p<0.001, 95% C.I. 2.11-3.13, respectively). Our study's main limitation is the lack of information on mild (asymptomatic) or moderate cases of COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the risk of occupational burnout among physiotherapists working actively in clinical hospitals in south-eastern Poland during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The level of burnout among the studied physiotherapists was assessed using the Polish version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory by Maslach (MBI). The study was conducted from 20 March to 3 May, 2020 among physiotherapists working professionally during the COVID-19 pandemic in the south east of Poland, during which time health services related to therapeutic rehabilitation were suspended. The study was conducted among 1,540 physiotherapists with a license to practice who worked in clinical departments. Considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 106 physiotherapists were qualified for the study. RESULTS: The current findings show that during the COVID-19 pandemic physiotherapists present high burnout rates in all three dimensions: EE (Mean 32.31; CI 29.47-35.15); DP (Mean 16.25; CI 14.48-18.03); PA (Mean 26.25; CI 24.41-28.10). As for gender-related effects, higher burnout rates were observed in the male workers, compared to the females, in all three domains: EE (Men: Mean 34.70; CI 29.90-39.50 -Women: Mean 31.03; CI 27.45-34.60); DP (Men: Mean 18.78; CI 15.98-21.59 -Women: Mean 14.90; CI 12.64-17.16) and PA (Men: Mean 24.54; CI 21.32-27.76 -Women: Mean 27.17; CI 24.90-29.44). The highest burnout rates, presented by the physiotherapists working in the profession for more than 20 years, were identified in the domain of EE (Mean: 35.30; CI 30.51-40.10) and in those with 10-15 years of experience, in the domains of DP (Mean: 18.31; CI 14.89-21.73) and PA (Mean: 23.97; CI 20.13-27.81). The highest rate of occupational burnout, reflected by the scores in all three domains (EE, DP, PA), was identified in Department I -Intensive Care and Anaesthesiology Department: EE - (Mean: 40.89, CI 35.27-46.52); DP - (Mean: 21.39, CI 17.90-24.88); and PA - (Mean: 23.07, CI 20.04-26.10), compared to the other departments. The subjects who rarely participated in courses or training programs showed the highest burnout rates (EE- Mean: 33.55, CI 29.33-37.77; DP- Mean: 16.71, CI 13.99-19.43; PA- Mean: 25.45, CI 22.47-28.43). CONCLUSIONS: Occupational burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic is noticeable among physiotherapists working in clinical departments. The current findings show high burnout rates in all three domains: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP) and personal accomplishment (PA). A comparative analysis of these findings with reference to related studies published before the pandemic shows that the burnout rates among physiotherapists may have significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, given the scarcity of scientific evidence related to this specific problem in Poland and worldwide, it is necessary to continue research in occupational burnout affecting physiotherapists, particularly during the second wave of the pandemic, in order to gain a better understanding of the possible effects of social isolation and greater personal work-related health risks on the mental health of these medical professionals.","Pniak, Bogumila; Leszczak, Justyna; Adamczyk, Marzena; Rusek, Wojciech; Matlosz, Piotr; Guzik, Agnieszka",Work,,585

This article explores the human rights dimensions of how these new surveillance technologies are being used and assesses the extent to which they entail legitimate restrictions to a range of human rights, including the rights to health, life, and privacy. We argue that human rights offer a crucial framework for protecting the public from regulatory overreach by ensuring that digital health surveillance does not undermine fundamental features of democratic society. First, we describe the surveillance technologies being used to address COVID-19 and reposition these technologies within the evolution of public health surveillance tools and the emergence of discussions concerning the compatibility of such tools with human rights. We then evaluate the potential human rights implications of the surveillance tools being used today by analyzing the extent to which they pass the tests of necessity and proportionality enshrined in international human rights law. We conclude by recommending ways in which the harmful human rights effects associated with these technologies might be reduced and public trust in their use enhanced.","Sekalala, Sharifah Dagron Stéphanie Forman Lisa Meier Benjamin Mason",Health and Human Rights,,585

Importantly, cRASL-seq analysis of COVID-19 patient nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens does not involve nucleic acid purification or reverse transcription, steps that have introduced supply bottlenecks into standard assay workflows. Our simplified protocol additionally enables the direct and efficient genotyping of selected, informative SARS-CoV-2 polymorphisms across the entire genome, which can be used for enhanced characterization of transmission chains at population scale and detection of viral clades with higher or lower virulence. Given its extremely low per-sample cost, simple and automatable protocol and analytics, probe panel modularity, and massive scalability, we propose that cRASL-seq testing is a powerful new technology with the potential to help mitigate the current pandemic and prevent similar public health crises.","Credle, Joel J; Robinson, Matthew L; Gunn, Jonathan; Monaco, Daniel; Sie, Brandon; Tchir, Alexandra; Hardick, Justin; Zheng, Xuwen; Shaw-Saliba, Kathryn; Rothman, Richard E; Eshleman, Susan H; Pekosz, Andrew; Hansen, Kasper; Mostafa, Heba; Steinegger, Martin; Larman, H Benjamin",Mod. pathol,,585

Individuals infected by the virus exhibited different degrees of symptoms, and most convalescent individuals have been shown to develop both cellular and humoral immune responses. However, virus-specific adaptive immune responses in severe patients during acute phase have not been thoroughly studied. Here, we found that in a group of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during hospitalization, most of them mounted SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses, including neutralizing antibodies. However, compared to healthy controls, the percentages and absolute numbers of both NK cells and CD8+ T cells were significantly reduced, with decreased IFNÎ³ expression in CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood from severe patients. Most notably, their peripheral blood lymphocytes failed in producing IFNÎ³ against viral proteins. Thus, severe COVID-19 patients at acute infection stage developed SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses but were impaired in cellular immunity, which emphasizes on the role of cellular immunity in COVID-19.","Ni, Ling; Cheng, Meng-Li; Feng, Yu; Zhao, Hui; Liu, Jingyuan; Ye, Fang; Ye, Qing; Zhu, Gengzhen; Li, Xiaoli; Wang, Pengzhi; Shao, Jing; Deng, Yong-Qiang; Wei, Peng; Chen, Fang; Qin, Cheng-Feng; Wang, Guoqing; Li, Fan; Zeng, Hui; Dong, Chen",Front Immunol,,585

One such underrecognized and unaddressed area is the mental health issues medical staff develop during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review aimed to review the literature about mental health problems faced by health care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Literature search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Embase. All types of articles published in the last 4 months (January 2020-April 2020) which were relevant to the subject of the review were searched. A total of 23 articles were selected by initial screening and 6 articles were included in the final review. RESULTS: Review of all the 6 articles showed that current research focused on assessing several aspects of mental health affected in HCW due to COVID-19. Several sociodemographic variables like gender, profession, age, place of work, department of work and psychological variables like poor social support, self-efficacy were associated with increased stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia in HCW. There is increasing evidence that suggests that COVID-19 can be an independent risk factor for stress in HCW. CONCLUSION: Regular screening of medical personnel involved in treating, diagnosing patients with COVID-19 should be done for evaluating stress, depression and anxiety by using multidisciplinary Psychiatry teams.","Spoorthy, Mamidipalli Sai; Pratapa, Sree Karthik; Mahant, Supriya",Asian J Psychiatr,,585

For those with tinnitus, such changes can be factors in exacerbating tinnitus. The purpose of this study was to determine tinnitus help-seeking behavior, which resources individuals utilized to cope during the pandemic, and what additional support is desired. Method An exploratory cross-sectional study design including 1,522 adults with tinnitus living in North America (Canada and the United States) was used. Data were collected through an online survey distributed by the American Tinnitus Association via e-mail. Free text from open-ended questions was analyzed using the automated content analysis. The responses to the structured questionnaire were analyzed using descriptive and nonparametric statistics. Results Significantly less tinnitus support was sought during the pandemic, and very few respondents utilized tinnitus support networks during the pandemic at the time the survey was conducted. Nonetheless, seeking support during the pandemic was significantly associated with significantly less tinnitus distress. The most frequently utilized resources for coping during the pandemic were contacting family and friends, spending time outdoors or in nature, relaxation, and exercise. Such tools for coping were associated with significantly less tinnitus distress. The support requested and advice provided by participants to health care services had overlap. The main support needs related to managing tinnitus included addressing hearing loss, providing peer support, finding cures, and accessing trained and understanding health care providers to help. The advice for professionals related to tinnitus management included the need for cures, personalized support, addressing hearing loss, targeting the tinnitus percept, and providing more information about the condition. Conclusions These findings provide suggestions on how to better support those with tinnitus at a time when health care is undergoing rapid changes. Findings can be used by stakeholders, clinical practitioners, and tinnitus support services to devise ways to work more effectively together to improve access to patient-driven, suitable, accessible, and evidence-based support.

292591,The Application of a Hospital Medical Surge Preparedness Index to Assess National Pandemic and Other Mass Casualty Readiness,2021,"Emergent coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV can cause significant morbidity and mortality in infected individuals. Lung infection is a common clinical feature and contributes to disease severity as well as viral transmission. Animal models are often required to study viral infections and therapies, especially during an initial outbreak. Histopathology studies allow for identification of lesions and affected cell types to better understand viral pathogenesis and clarify effective therapies. Use of immunostaining allows detection of presumed viral receptors and viral tropism for cells can be evaluated to correlate with lesions. In the lung, lesions and immunostaining can be qualitatively described to define the cell types, microanatomic location, and type of changes seen. These features are important and necessary, but this approach can have limitations when comparing treatment groups. Semiquantitative and quantitative tissue scores are more rigorous as these provide the ability to statistically compare groups and increase the reproducibility and rigor of the study.

We performed a cross-sectional, analytical, multicenter study in 3792 study respondents on the use, the reason for use, and perception of relief after the use of six drugs during the quarantine period. An online questionnaire was developed, pretested and submitted to the general public. Multivariable logistic regression was used to ascertain factors that influence an individual's desire to self-medicate, associations were considered significant at pâ¯<â¯0.05 and using region (coast, mountain and jungle) as cluster group. The majority of respondents self-medicated with acetaminophen for respiratory symptoms and mainly because they had a cold or flu. It was observed that all the surveyed drugs (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, azithromycin, penicillin, antiretrovirals and hydroxychloroquine) were consumed for various symptoms including: fever, fatigue, cough, sneezing, muscle pain, nasal congestion, sore throat, headache and breathing difficulty. Over 90% of respondents perceived relief of at least one symptom. Multivariable logistic regression showed that older people have a higher frequency of antiretroviral self-medication, respondents who currently have a job had a higher frequency of penicillin self-medication, and that respondents from the Andes consumed less acetaminophen, while the ones from the rainforest consumed it more. There were significant percentages of self-medication, including drugs without sufficient scientific evidence.

Models offer a systematic way to investigate transmission dynamics and produce short-term and long-term predictions that explicitly integrate assumptions about biological, behavioural, and epidemiological processes that affect disease transmission, burden, and surveillance. Models have been valuable tools during the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious disease outbreaks, able to generate possible trajectories of disease burden, evaluate the effectiveness of intervention strategies, and estimate key transmission variables. Particularly given the rapid pace of model development, evaluation, and integration with decision making in emergency situations, it is necessary to understand the benefits and pitfalls of transmission models. We review and highlight key aspects of the history of infectious disease dynamic models, the role of rigorous testing and evaluation, the integration with data, and the successful application of models to guide public health. Rather than being an expansive history of infectious disease models, this Review focuses on how the integration of modelling can continue to be advanced through policy and practice in appropriate and conscientious ways to support the current pandemic response.","Becker, Alexander D; Grantz, Kyra H; Hegde, Sonia T; Bérubé, Sophie; Cummings, Derek A T; Wesolowski, Amy",Lancet Digit Health,,585

The workflow consists in a multi-step approach that goes from identifying the main causes of patient's outcome through BSL, to the realization of a tool suitable for clinical practice, based on a Binary Decision Tree (BDT), to recognize patients at high-risk with information available already at hospital admission time. We evaluate our approach on a feature-rich COVID-19 dataset, showing that the proposed framework provides a schematic overview of the multi-factorial processes that jointly contribute to the outcome. We discuss how these computational findings are confirmed by current understanding of the COVID-19 pathogenesis. Further, our approach yields to a highly interpretable tool correctly predicting the outcome of 85% of subjects based exclusively on 3 features: age, a previous history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio at the time of arrival to the hospital.

293723,Does online pornography influence the sexuality of adolescents during COVID-19?,2020,"This research is the earliest attempt to understand the impact of inflation and the interest rate on output growth in the context of Pakistan using the wavelet transformation approach. For this study, we used monthly data on inflation, the interest rate, and industrial production from January 1991 to May 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected economies around the world, especially in view of the measures taken by governmental authorities regarding enforced lockdowns and social distancing. Traditional studies empirically explored the relationship between these important macroeconomic variables only for the short run and long run. Firstly, we employed the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) cointegration test and two causality tests (Granger causality and Toda–Yamamoto) to check the cointegration properties and causal relationship among these variables, respectively. After confirming the long-run causality from the ARDL bound test, we decomposed the time series of growth, inflation, and the interest rate into different time scales using wavelet analysis which allows us to study the relationship among variables for the very short run, medium run, long run, and very long run. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT), the cross-wavelet transform (XWT), cross-wavelet coherence (WTC), and multi-scale Granger causality tests were used to investigate the co-movement and nature of the causality between inflation and growth and the interest rate and growth. The results of the wavelet and multi-scale Granger causality tests show that the causal relationship between these variables is not the same across all time horizons;rather, it is unidirectional in the short-run and medium-run but bi-directional in the long-run. Therefore, this study suggests that the central bank should try to maintain inflation and the interest rate at a low level in the short run and medium run instead of putting too much pressure on these variables in the long-run.","Hayat, Muhammad Azmat Ghulam Huma Batool Maryam Naeem Muhammad Zahid Ejaz Abdullah Spulbar Cristi Birau Ramona",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,,585
294096,Insights From a Romanian Public Sector Innovation Lab on How to Build Urban Resilience in the Face of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Telemedicine (TM) is currently flourishing in rural and emergency settings, but its implementation in the routine management of chronic neurological disorders has developed with more hesitation. Limited access to specialized care facilities and expanding patient populations, combined with unprecedented mobility restrictions imposed by the coronavirus disease pandemic, are currently stressing the need for remote solutions in this field. Studies in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been heterogeneous in objectives and methodology but generally support the concept that TM interventions produce clinical benefits, cost-effectiveness, and user satisfaction. Nonetheless, data on live interaction between patients and health care providers for MS teleconsultation purposes remain scarce. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of planned real time audiovisual teleconsultation over the internet for patients with MS. METHODS: A total of 20 patients with MS presenting at a specialized MS center in Belgium were recruited for this study. One teleconsultation was scheduled for each participant. Patients were provided a unique hyperlink by mail in advance, leading them automatically and directly to the virtual waiting room, where they could accept or decline our incoming call. All teleconsultations were performed by a trained medical student with the intention to keep the conversation similar to what is usually discussed during a classic face-to-face MS consultation; no remote physical exams were performed. The approach was considered feasible if at least 80% of the planned TM visits could be successfully completed at the foreseen moment. Patient satisfaction (technical quality, convenience, and overall quality of care) was evaluated at the end of each teleconsultation by means of 5-point Likert scales containing the categories very unsatisfied, unsatisfied, neutral, satisfied, and highly satisfied. RESULTS: Out of 20 consultations, 17 were successfully completed (85%). Failures were due to patients not responding (n=2) and technical issues (n=1). Out of the 17 consultations, 17 patients declared themselves satisfied or highly satisfied for technical quality, 15 patients for convenience, and 16 patients for overall quality of care. CONCLUSIONS: Planned real time audiovisual teleconsultation over the internet is feasible and highly appreciated in patients with MS. Incorporation of such services in routine clinical MS practice is expected to improve access to specialized care facilities for affected patients.","D039,; Haeseleer, Miguel; Eelen, Piet; Sadeghi, Nima; Hooghe, Marie B; Van Schependom, Jeroen; Nagels, Guy",J Med Internet Res,,585
294413,Socioeconomic Factors influencing the Spatial Spread of COVID-19 in the United States,2020,"BACKGROUND: Depression is associated with biases in facial emotion processing, which have an impact on the course and treatment of depression. While decades of research have established a negativity bias in processing in depression, there is still a gap in our understanding of how depression severity impacts sensitivity to detecting differences in emotional faces. METHODS: We examined emotion sensitivity (ES), or the ability to to detect subtle differences in emotional faces, in a large, geographically and culturally diverse, web-based sample (N = 6598, age range = 18-96, 56.50% female, 66% Caucasian). Participants completed ES tasks (fear, anger, or happiness) and a Beck Depression Inventory-II, to determine depression severity. RESULTS: Depression severity was correlated with overall ES performance as well as ES performance for individual emotions. Higher depression scores were associated with poorer performance in detecting happiness, fear, and anger (ps < .001). Examining performance by region, Eastern countries showed significantly poorer ES performance compared to Western countries, and were significantly more depressed. LIMITATIONS: Our sample is non-clinical and self-selected. CONCLUSIONS: This study is an extension of existing research on emotional facial processing, with an approach that takes into consideration the heterogeneity of depression symptoms and corrects psychometric confounds of traditional emotion face processing paradigms. Overall, factors related to severity, task reliability, and facial stimuli should be considered in determining the potential mechanism of facial emotion processing in the onset and course of depression.","Rutter, Lauren A; Passell, Eliza; Scheuer, Luke; Germine, Laura",J Affect Disord,,585

Hence, this study examined the impact of financial empowerment and entrepreneurial venture creation among NGO beneficiaries in Kwara State, Nigeria. The study was posited on the empowerment theory. A survey was carried out employing the simple random sampling technique to select 358 respondents from a total of 5,354 sampling frame of NGOs' beneficiaries in Kwara State. Data analysis was performed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results indicated that financial empowerment contributes significantly to entrepreneurial venture creation among the NGOs' beneficiaries. It was further revealed that cash loans and subsidies offered by NGOs have a positive impact on entrepreneurial venture creation, while grants have an inverse impact on entrepreneurial venture creation. The study, therefore, suggests among other things that the management of NGOs should scrutinize business plans properly before giving loans, grants, and subsidies to the beneficiaries so that only viable and innovative ideas will be funded. Also, they should offer training and enlightenment to beneficiaries to ensure the presence of unique and innovative activities and solutions pointing at entrepreneurial ventures creation.","Adetoro, Eletta Onaopemipo Modupe Adeyeye Mercy Samuel Sajuyigbe Ademola",The Journal of Entrepreneurial Finance,,585

The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to substantial changes in many fields of medicine, specifically in the forensic discipline. Medicolegal activities related to conducting autopsies have been largely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Postmortem examinations are generally discouraged by government regulations due to the risk of spreading the disease further through the handling and dissection of bodies from patients who succumbed to COVID-19 infection. There is a paucity of data regarding the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in bodies, as well as concerning the reliability of swabbing methods in human remains. On the other hand, the autopsy is an essential tool to provide necessary information about the pathophysiology of the disease that presents useful clinical and epidemiological insights. On this basis, we aim to address issues concerning general medical examiner/coroner organization, comparing the Italian and American systems. We also discuss the pivotal roles of forensic pathologists in informing infectious disease surveillance. Finally, we focus on the impact of COVID-19 emergency on medicolegal practices in Italy and the United States, as well as the responses of the forensic scientific community to the emerging concerns related to the pandemic. We believe that stronger efforts by authorities are necessary to facilitate completing postmortem examinations, as data derived from such assessments are expected to be paramount to improving patient management and disease prevention.","Moretti, Matteo; Malhotra, Ashim; Visonà, Silvia D; Finley, Sheree J; Osculati, Antonio Marco Maria; Javan, Gulnaz T",Forensic sci. med. pathol.

However, main-chain structures of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD are almost the same with that of the SARS-CoV RBD. Understanding physical mechanism responsible for the outstanding affinity between the SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2 is the""urgent challenge""for developing blockers, vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Considering the mechanisms of hydrophobic interaction, hydration shell, surface tension, and the shielding effect of water molecules, this study reveals a hydrophobic-interaction-based mechanism by means of which SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2 bind together in an aqueous environment. The hydrophobic interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2 protein is found to be significantly greater than that between SARS-CoV S and ACE2. At the docking site, the hydrophobic portions of the hydrophilic side chains of SARS-CoV-2 S are found to be involved in the hydrophobic interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2. We propose a method to design live attenuated viruses by mutating several key amino acid residues of the spike protein to decrease the hydrophobic surface areas at the docking site. Mutation of a small amount of residues can greatly reduce the hydrophobic binding of the coronavirus to the receptor, which may be significant reduce infectivity and transmissibility of the virus.","Li, Jiacheng; Ma, Xiaoliang; Guo, Shuai; Hou, Chengyu; Shi, Liping; Zhang, Hongchi; Zheng, Bing; Liao, Chencheng; Yang, Lin; Ye, Lin; He, Xiaodong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11883v1.pdf,585

The data were subjected to a lexicometric analysis to qualify and quantify words by analyzing their statistical distribution, using the ALCESTE method with the IRaMuTeQ software. RESULTS: In order of frequency, the terms most frequently used to describe e-mental health in the whole corpus are: ""care"" (n=21), ""internet"" (n=21), ""computing"" (n=15), ""health"" (n=14), ""information"" (n=13), ""patient"" (n=12), and ""tool"" (n=12). The corpus of text is divided into 2 themes, with technological and computing terms on one side and medical and public health terms on the other. The largest family is focused on ""care,"" ""advances,"" ""research,"" ""life,"" ""quality,"" and ""well-being,"" which was significantly associated with users. The nursing group used very medical terms such as ""treatment,"" ""diagnosis,"" ""psychiatry"","" and ""patient"" to define e-mental health. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that there is a gap between the representations of users on e-mental health as a tool for improving their quality of life and those of health professionals (except nurses) that are more focused on the technological potential of these digital care tools. Developers, designers, clinicians, and users must be aware of the social representation of e-mental health conditions uses and intention of use. This understanding of everyone's stakes will make it possible to redirect the development of tools to adapt them as much as possible to the needs and expectations of the actors of the mental health system.","Morgiève, Margot; Mesdjian, Pierre; Las Vergnas, Olivier; Bury, Patrick; Demassiet, Vincent; Roelandt, Jean-Luc; Sebbane, Déborah",JMIR Ment Health,,585
298630,Healthcare Transparency in the Age of COVID-19,2020,"Acetyl L-carnitine (ALCAR), a dietary supplement and an antioxidant, plays a vital role in the bioenergetic process that produces ATP. Although there are reports on antioxidant toxicity, there is no information on the potential toxicity of ALCAR. Here, using zebrafish embryos, we explored whether ALCAR modulated ATP synthesis, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and expression of specific genes related to major signaling pathways that control metabolism, growth, differentiation, apoptosis and oxidative stress. First, we show that ALCAR elicits a physiologic response, as ATP levels increased after ALCAR treatment. Simultaneously, an increase in the expression of ROS, a by-product of ATP synthesis, was observed in the ALCAR-treated embryos. Consistent with higher ROS expression, the level of cysteine, a precursor of glutathione, was significantly reduced. ALCAR did not have any drastic effect on overall development and heart rate. Polymerase chain reaction-based gene expression array analyses showed no significant change in the expression of 83 genes related to 10 major signaling pathways including: the transforming growth factor ß (TGFß), Wingless and Int-1 (Wnt), nuclear factor &#954;-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#954;B), Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT), p53, Notch, Hedgehog, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), oxidative stress, and hypoxia pathways. Our results show that the expression of 83 genes related to these major signaling pathways did not change significantly.","Gu, Qiang; Ali, Syed F; Kanungo, Jyotshna",J. appl. toxicol,,585
298687,"Indirect Impacts of COVID-19: A Case Study of Evidence, Advice and Representation From Consumer and Community Members in New South Wales Australia",2021,"OBJECTIVES: To analyze current interventional radiology residency program websites based on validated criteria and highlight areas for improvement during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ACGME-accredited interventional radiology residency programs were identified from the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) public database, including 91 independent and 89 integrated programs. Program Webpages were then evaluated during September and October 2020 based on the presence of 48 criteria, organized into seven main categories including visibility & communication, program information, curriculum information, faculty description, research, recruitment, and salary and benefits. Programs were also evaluated based on region and research ranking. Additionally, 166 programs with accreditation for Early Specialization in Interventional Radiology (ESIR) were assessed for the presence or absence of ESIR pathway acknowledgement on program webpages. RESULTS: The online search yielded information on all integrated programs (89/89, 100%) and 74 independent programs (74/91, 80.3%). For the ESIR programs, the online search for accreditation acknowledgement yielded 108 programs (108/166, 65%) approved for this pathway. Only seven of the 89 integrated programs met at least 75% of the criteria. Of the 91 independent programs, only one met at least 75% of the criteria. On average, integrated programs met more criteria (25, 52%) than independent programs (17, 36%). When comparing programs based on national rank, the visibility & communication category met more criteria on average than the lower ranked programs (integrated =73% vs. 64%, pâ¯=â¯0.01), (independentâ¯=â¯73% vs. 45%, pâ¯=â¯0.01). When comparing programs regionally, statistical significance was found only in the research category (pâ¯=â¯0.01). When comparing the integrated programs with the independent programs for averages in the 7 categories and the total criteria, statistical significance was found in all categories except facility description: visibility & communication (67.5% vs. 53. 7%, pâ¯=â¯0.01), program information (75.7% vs. 58%, pâ¯=â¯0.01), curriculum information (54.8% vs. 31.4, pâ¯=â¯0.01), research (42.5% vs. 27.5%, pâ¯=â¯0.01), recruitment (42.6% vs. 26.8%, pâ¯=â¯0.01), salary & benefits (47.8% vs. 26.8%, pâ¯=â¯0.01), and total criteria (52% vs. 35.8%, pâ¯=â¯0.01. CONCLUSION: IR residency programs across the country are proficient in providing curricular, and logistical information online. However, improvement is needed in providing nonacademic highlights unique to programs that can aid in maximizing applicant match and compatibility. The information provided by online resources has the potential to influence residency applicant's program ranking and chosen pathway, particularly during the COVID19 pandemic.","Makary, Mina S; Niedermeier, Marilyn; Grewal, B K; Heilala, Adam; Ahmed, Osman",Acad. radiol,,585

DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from 22 March through 20 May 2020. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04308668). SETTING: Internet-based trial across the United States and Canada (40 states and 3 provinces). PARTICIPANTS: Symptomatic, nonhospitalized adults with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or probable COVID-19 and high-risk exposure within 4 days of symptom onset. INTERVENTION: Oral hydroxychloroquine (800 mg once, followed by 600 mg in 6 to 8 hours, then 600 mg daily for 4 more days) or masked placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Symptoms and severity at baseline and then at days 3, 5, 10, and 14 using a 10-point visual analogue scale. The primary end point was change in overall symptom severity over 14 days. RESULTS: Of 491 patients randomly assigned to a group, 423 contributed primary end point data. Of these, 341 (81%) had laboratory-confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or epidemiologically linked exposure to a person with laboratory-confirmed infection; 56% (236 of 423) were enrolled within 1 day of symptoms starting. Change in symptom severity over 14 days did not differ between the hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups (difference in symptom severity: relative, 12%; absolute, -0.27 point [95% CI, -0.61 to 0.07 point]; P = 0.117). At 14 days, 24% (49 of 201) of participants receiving hydroxychloroquine had ongoing symptoms compared with 30% (59 of 194) receiving placebo (P = 0.21). Medication adverse effects occurred in 43% (92 of 212) of participants receiving hydroxychloroquine versus 22% (46 of 211) receiving placebo (P < 0.001). With placebo, 10 hospitalizations occurred (2 non-COVID-19-related), including 1 hospitalized death. With hydroxychloroquine, 4 hospitalizations occurred plus 1 nonhospitalized death (P = 0.29).

In sub-Saharan Africa, which experiences the highest rates of unintended pregnancy and unsafe abortion globally, COVID-19 is projected to slow recent progress toward universal access to contraceptive services. METHODS: We used longitudinal data collected from women at risk of unintended pregnancy in Burkina Faso (n=1186) and Kenya (n=2784) before (November 2019-February 2020) and during (May-July 2020) COVID-19 to quantify contraceptive dynamics during COVID-19; examine sociodemographic factors and COVID-19 experiences related to contraceptive dynamics; and assess COVID-19-related reasons for contraceptive non-use. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine correlates of contraceptive dynamics amid COVID-19. RESULTS: Most women did not change their contraceptive status during COVID-19 (68.6% in Burkina Faso and 81.6% in Kenya) and those who did were more likely to adopt a method (25.4% and 13.1%, respectively) than to discontinue (6.0% and 5.3%, respectively). Most women who switched contraceptives were using methods as or more effective than their pre-pandemic contraception. Economic instability related to COVID-19 was associated with increased contraceptive protection in Burkina Faso but not in Kenya. Altogether, 14.4% of non-contraceptive users in Kenya and 3.8% in Burkina Faso identified COVID-19-related reasons for non-use. CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of women at risk of unintended pregnancy did not change their contraceptive status during COVID-19, and more women adopted than discontinued methods. A minority of women reported COVID-19-related reasons for non-use, underscoring the importance of expanding safe modes of service delivery during health crises.","Karp, Celia; Wood, Shannon N; Guiella, Georges; Gichangi, Peter; Bell, Suzanne O; Anglewicz, Philip; Larson, Elizabeth; Zimmerman, Linnea; Moreau, Caroline",BMJ sex. reprod. health (Online),,585
300460,"Coming Out to Play: Privacy, Data Protection, Children's Health, and COVID-19 Research",2021,"With the prevalence of online social networking sites (OSNs) and mobile devices, people are increasingly reliant on a variety of OSNs for keeping in touch with family and friends, and using it as a source of information. For example, a user might utilise multiple OSNs for different purposes, such as using Flickr to share holiday pictures with family and friends, and Twitter to post short messages about their thoughts. Identifying the same user across multiple OSNs is an important task as this allows us to understand the usage patterns of users among different OSNs, make recommendations when a user registers for a new OSN, and various other useful applications. To address this problem, we proposed an algorithm based on the multilayer perceptron using various types of features, namely: (i) user profile, such as name, location, description; (ii) temporal distribution of user generated content; and (iii) embedding based on user name, real name and description. Using a Twitter and Flickr dataset of users and their posting activities, we perform an empirical study on how these features affect the performance of user identification across the two OSNs and discuss our main findings based on the different features.","Solanki, Prashant; Lim, Kwan Hui; Harwood, Aaron",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11815v1.pdf,585

Participants provided information about their past-week unhealthy food and alcohol consumption and mental health. Using latent growth curve modeling analysis, we found that higher perceived health and interpersonal COVID-19 impact, younger age and lower depression symptoms were associated with more rapid increases over time in unhealthy food consumption. On the other hand, higher perceived COVID-19 economic impact and older age were associated with more rapid diachronic decreases in alcohol consumption. Gender and living with or without children, for women only, were moderators of these trajectories.

The diversity of themes identified in this paper can be grouped into the following categories of disease mapping: spatiotemporal analysis, health and social geography, environmental variables, data mining, and web-based mapping. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19 is essential for its mitigation, as it helps to clarify the extent and impact of the pandemic and can aid decision making, planning and community action. Health geography highlights the interaction of public health officials, affected actors and first responders to improve estimations of disease propagation and likelihoods of new outbreaks. Attempts at interdisciplinary correlation examine health policy interventions for the siting of health/sanitary services and controls, mapping/tracking of human movement, formulation of appropriate scientific and political responses and projection of spatial diffusion and temporal trends. This review concludes that, to fight COVID-19, it is important to face the challenges from an interdisciplinary perspective, with proactive planning, international solidarity and a global perspective. This review provides useful information and insight that can support future bibliographic queries, and also serves as a resource for understanding the evolution of tools used in the management of this major global pandemic of the 21 Century.

Methods: We included all the deceased patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to &gt;200 health facilities in Wuhan between December 1 and February 24, 2020. The median survival time in COVID-19 patients with and without hypertension, the association of hypertension with the disease severity, and the risk factors associated with the COVID-19 mortality stratified by the hypertension status were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, logistic regression, and Cox proportional regression, respectively before and after the propensity score-matching (PS) for age and sex. Results: The prevalence of hypertension in the studied 1,833 COVID-19 patients was 40.5%. Patients with hypertension were more likely to have severe COVID-19 illness than patients without hypertension;the PS-matched multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) was 2.44 (1.77-3.08). Moreover, the median survival time in the hypertension group was 3-5 days shorter than the non-hypertension group. There was a 2-fold increased risk of COVID-19 mortality in the hypertension group compared with the non-hypertension group;the PS-matched multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 2.04 (1.61-2.72), and the significant increased risk of COVID-19 mortality in the moderate vs. mild COVID-19 illness was confined to patients with hypertension. Additionally, the history and the number of underlying chronic diseases, occupation, and residential location showed stronger associations with the COVID-19 mortality among patients with hypertension than patients without hypertension. Conclusion: Hypertension was associated with the severity and mortality of COVID-19 illness.","Mubarik, S.; Liu, X.; Eshak, E.

303446,Situation analysis and an insight into assessment of pandemic COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Significant human and material resources have been diverted to COVID-19. Healthcare workers are at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Gastroenterology and Hepatology departments and specialists in Spain. METHODS: Nationwide survey addressing the impact of COVID-19 on resources, procedures and physicians of Gastroenterology and Hepatology departments in 81 hospitals representative of the Spanish National Health Service. RESULTS: Overall, 41.8% of hospital beds and 40.7% of Gastroenterology and Hepatology beds were allocated to COVID-19 patient care, as well as 24.8% of gastroenterologists and 58.3% of residents. Outpatient visits, abdominal ultrasounds and endoscopies were reduced by 81.8-91.9%. Nine large university hospitals had 75% and 89% reductions in therapeutic endoscopies and hepatocellular carcinoma surgery, respectively, with cancellation of elective liver transplant and TIPS. Prevalence of infected physicians was 10.6% and was dependent on regional population incidence (r = 0.74, P = 0.001), with 11% hospitalized and one physician dying. Up to 63.4% of physicians may have been infected before or shortly after Spain entered lockdown, 57% of them having recently performed endoscopies. Adequate protection was acknowledged in >80% hospitals but only 2.9% performed regular SARS-CoV-2 testing. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery has been massive. A wave of Gastroenterology-related complications is expected due to resource diversion. Gastroenterologists have a high prevalence of infection although they may have been infected during a first phase of lower awareness and protection. Regular SARS-CoV-2 screening, adequate protection and quick reorganization of healthcare resources are still needed.","Crespo, Javier; Fernández Carrillo, Carlos; Iruzubieta, Paula; Hernández-Conde, Marta; Rasines, Laura; Jorquera, Francisco; Albillos, Agustín; Bañares, Rafael; Mora, Pedro; Fernández Vázquez, Inmaculada; Hernández-Guerra, Manuel; Turnes, Juan; Calleja, José Luis",J. gastroenterol. hepatol,,585
303456,COVID-19: local lessons from a global pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have investigated the implication of air pollution and some social determinants on COVID-19-related outcomes, but none of them assessed the implication of spatial repartition of the socio-environmental determinants on geographic variations of COVID-19 related outcomes. Understanding spatial heterogeneity in relation to the socio-environmental determinant and COVID-19-related outcomes is central to target interventions toward a vulnerable population. OBJECTIVES: To determine the spatial variability of COVID-19 related outcomes among the elderly in France at the department level. We also aimed to assess whether a geographic pattern of Covid-19 may be partially explained by spatial distribution of both long-term exposure to air pollution and deprived living conditions. METHODS: This study considered four health events related to COVID-19 infection over the period of 18 March and 02 December 2020: (i) hospitalization, (ii) cases in intensive health care in the hospital, (iii) death in the hospital, and (iv) hospitalized patients recovered and returned back home. We used the percentage of household living in an overcrowding housing to characterize the living conditions and long-term exposure to NO2 to analyse the implication of air pollution. Using a spatial scan statistic approach, a Poisson cluster analysis method based on a likelihood ratio test and Monte Carlo replications was applied to identify high-risk clusters of a COVID-19-related outcome. RESULT: our results revealed that all the outcomes related to COVID-19 infection investigated were not randomly distributed in France with a statistically significant cluster of high risk located in Eastern France of the hospitalization, cases in the intensive health care at the hospital, death in the hospital, and recovered and returned back home compared to the rest of France (relative risk, RR = 1.28, p-value = 0.001, RR = 3.05, p = 0.001, RR = 2.94, p = 0.001, RR = 2.51, p = 0.001, respectively). After adjustments for socio-environmental determinants, the crude cluster shifts according to different scenarios suggested that both the overcrowding housing level and long-term exposure to largely NO2 explain the spatial distribution of COVID-19-related outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the geographic pattern of COVID-19-related outcomes is largely explained by socio-spatial distribution of long-term exposure to NO2. However, to better understand spatial variations of COVID-19-related outcomes, it would be necessary to investigate and adjust it for other determinants. Thus, the current sanitary crisis reminds us of how unequal we all are in facing this disease.","Deguen, Séverine; Kihal-Talantikite, Wahida",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,585

304889,0005 Impact of COVID on hospital based violence intervention programs,2021,"BACKGROUND: During a pandemic, it is important for clinicians to stratify patients and decide who receives limited medical resources. Machine learning models have been proposed to accurately predict COVID-19 disease severity. Previous studies have typically tested only one machine learning algorithm and limited performance evaluation to area under the curve analysis. To obtain the best results possible, it may be important to test different machine learning algorithms to find the best prediction model. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to use automated machine learning (autoML) to train various machine learning algorithms. We selected the model that best predicted patients' chances of surviving a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we identified which variables (ie, vital signs, biomarkers, comorbidities, etc) were the most influential in generating an accurate model. METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from all patients who tested positive for COVID-19 at our institution between March 1 and July 3, 2020. We collected 48 variables from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time (ie, real-time polymerase chain reaction positivity). Patients were followed for 30 days or until death. Patients' data were used to build 20 machine learning models with various algorithms via autoML. The performance of machine learning models was measured by analyzing the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPCR). Subsequently, we established model interpretability via Shapley additive explanation and partial dependence plots to identify and rank variables that drove model predictions. Afterward, we conducted dimensionality reduction to extract the 10 most influential variables. AutoML models were retrained by only using these 10 variables, and the output models were evaluated against the model that used 48 variables. RESULTS: Data from 4313 patients were used to develop the models. The best model that was generated by using autoML and 48 variables was the stacked ensemble model (AUPRC=0.807). The two best independent models were the gradient boost machine and extreme gradient boost models, which had an AUPRC of 0.803 and 0.793, respectively. The deep learning model (AUPRC=0.73) was substantially inferior to the other models. The 10 most influential variables for generating high-performing models were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, pulse oximetry level, blood urea nitrogen level, lactate dehydrogenase level, D-dimer level, troponin level, respiratory rate, and Charlson comorbidity score. After the autoML models were retrained with these 10 variables, the stacked ensemble model still had the best performance (AUPRC=0.791). CONCLUSIONS: We used autoML to develop high-performing models that predicted the survival of patients with COVID-19. In addition, we identified important variables that correlated with mortality. This is proof of concept that autoML is an efficient, effective, and informative method for generating machine learning-based clinical decision support tools.","Ikemura, Kenji; Bellin, Eran; Yagi, Yukako; Billett, Henny; Saada, Mahmoud; Simone, Katelyn; Stahl, Lindsay; Szymanski, James; Goldstein, D Y; Reyes Gil, Morayma",J Med Internet Res,,585

305580,The benefits of coronavirus suppression: A cost-benefit analysis of the response to the first wave of COVID-19 in the United States,2021,"BACKGROUND: Following implementation of strong containment measures, several countries and regions have low detectable community transmission of COVID-19. We developed an efficient, rapid, and scalable surveillance strategy to detect remaining COVID-19 community cases through exhaustive identification of every active transmission chain. We identified measures to enable early detection and effective management of any reintroduction of transmission once containment measures are lifted to ensure strong containment measures do not require reinstatement. METHODS: We compared efficiency and sensitivity to detect community transmission chains through testing of the following: hospital cases; fever, cough and/or ARI testing at community/primary care; and asymptomatic testing; using surveillance evaluation methods and mathematical modelling, varying testing capacities, reproductive number (R) and weekly cumulative incidence of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 respiratory symptoms using data from Australia. We assessed system requirements to identify all transmission chains and follow up all cases and primary contacts within each chain, per million population. RESULTS: Assuming 20% of cases are asymptomatic and 30% of symptomatic COVID-19 cases present for testing, with R = 2.2, a median of 14 unrecognised community cases (8 infectious) occur when a transmission chain is identified through hospital surveillance versus 7 unrecognised cases (4 infectious) through community-based surveillance. The 7 unrecognised community upstream cases are estimated to generate a further 55-77 primary contacts requiring follow-up. The unrecognised community cases rise to 10 if 50% of cases are asymptomatic. Screening asymptomatic community members cannot exhaustively identify all cases under any of the scenarios assessed. The most important determinant of testing requirements for symptomatic screening is levels of non-COVID-19 respiratory illness. If 4% of the community have respiratory symptoms, and 1% of those with symptoms have COVID-19, exhaustive symptomatic screening requires approximately 11,600 tests/million population using 1/4 pooling, with 98% of cases detected (2% missed), given 99.9% sensitivity. Even with a drop in sensitivity to 70%, pooling was more effective at detecting cases than individual testing under all scenarios examined. CONCLUSIONS: Screening all acute respiratory disease in the community, in combination with exhaustive and meticulous case and contact identification and management, enables appropriate early detection and elimination of COVID-19 community transmission. An important component is identification, testing, and management of all contacts, including upstream contacts (i.e. potential sources of infection for identified cases, and their related transmission chains). Pooling allows increased case detection when testing capacity is limited, even given reduced test sensitivity. Critical to the effectiveness of all aspects of surveillance is appropriate community engagement, messaging to optimise testing uptake and compliance with other measures.","Lokuge, K; Banks, E; Davis, S; Roberts, L; Street, T; O039,; Donovan, D; Caleo, G; Glass, K",BMC Med,,585

Methods: This is an ecological study, whose units of analysis were the 26 state capitals and the Federal District of Brazil. Prevalence was estimated by the results of the Vigilância de Fatores de Risco e Proteção para Doenças Crônicas por Inquérito Telefônico 2019 (VIGITEL). The general mortality rates due to COVID-19 were collected on the official website of the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MH) and stratified by the same Brazilian capitals evaluated in the VIGITEL survey. The rates included the period between the 1st and 29th Epidemiological Weeks of 2020. The Partial Correlation Test (r) was used, controlled for confounding factors, to evaluate the correlation between the prevalence of overweight/obesity and the overall mortality rates due to COVID-19. Results: The mean mortality rate for COVID-19 in the period was 65.1 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. Regarding the prevalence of obesity and overweight, 20.2% and 54.7% were the mean values observed in the state capitals, respectively. The prevalence of obesity was positively correlated with the overall mortality rate due to COVID-19, with mean positive correlation (r=0.380) and statistically significant correlation (p=0.034). Conclusion: This study pointed out that, at the aggregate level, there is a concomitant and correlated increase in mortality rates due to COVID-19 and prevalence of obesity in Brazilian capitals. The data found may contribute to actions to cope with the pandemic aimed at this population.","Carneiro, Raquel Alencastro Veiga Domingues; Hillesheim, Danúbia; Hallal, Ana Luiza Curi",Arch. endocrinol. metab.

306449,Hard Lessons: The Impact of Secondary Education on COVID-19 Cases and Deaths in the U.S (preprint),2021,"Phase I clinical trials are designed to test the safety (non-toxicity) of drugs and find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). This task becomes significantly more challenging when multiple-drug dose-combinations (DC) are involved, due to the inherent conflict between the exponentially increasing DC candidates and the limited patient budget. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian design, SDF-Bayes, for finding the MTD for drug combinations in the presence of safety constraints. Rather than the conventional principle of escalating or de-escalating the current dose of one drug (perhaps alternating between drugs), SDF-Bayes proceeds by cautious optimism: it chooses the next DC that, on the basis of current information, is most likely to be the MTD (optimism), subject to the constraint that it only chooses DCs that have a high probability of being safe (caution). We also propose an extension, SDF-Bayes-AR, that accounts for patient heterogeneity and enables heterogeneous patient recruitment. Extensive experiments based on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of SDF-Bayes over state of the art DC trial designs in terms of accuracy and safety.","Lee, Hyun-Suk; Shen, Cong; Zame, William; Lee, Jang-Won; Schaar, Mihaela van der",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10998v1.pdf,585

307458,Genetic Diversity of SARS-CoV-2 over a One-Year Period of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Global Perspective,2021,"BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence demonstrates that obesity is associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Excessive alcohol consumption and ""comfort eating"" as coping mechanisms during times of high stress have been shown to further exacerbate mental and physical ill-health. Global examples suggest that unhealthy food and alcohol brands and companies are using the COVID-19 pandemic to further market their products. However, there has been no systematic, in-depth analysis of how ""Big Food"" and ""Big Alcohol"" are capitalizing on the COVID-19 pandemic to market their products and brands. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to quantify the extent and nature of online marketing by alcohol and unhealthy food and beverage companies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. METHODS: We conducted a content analysis of all COVID-19-related social media posts made by leading alcohol and unhealthy food and beverage brands (n=42) and their parent companies (n=12) over a 4-month period (February to May 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. RESULTS: Nearly 80% of included brands and all parent companies posted content related to COVID-19 during the 4-month period. Quick service restaurants (QSRs), food and alcohol delivery companies, alcohol brands, and bottle shops were the most active in posting COVID-19-related content. The most common themes for COVID-19-related marketing were isolation activities and community support. Promotion of hygiene and home delivery was also common, particularly for QSRs and alcohol and food delivery companies. Parent companies were more likely to post about corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, such as donations of money and products, and to offer health advice. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that Big Food and Big Alcohol are incessantly marketing their products and brands on social media platforms using themes related to COVID-19, such as isolation activities and community support. Parent companies are frequently posting about CSR initiatives, such as donations of money and products, thereby creating a fertile environment to loosen current regulation or resist further industry regulation. ""COVID-washing"" by large alcohol brands, food and beverage brands, and their parent companies is both common and concerning. The need for comprehensive regulations to restrict unhealthy food and alcohol marketing, as recommended by the World Health Organization, is particularly acute in the COVID-19 context and is urgently required to ""build back better"" in a post-COVID-19 world.","Martino, Florentine; Brooks, Ruby; Browne, Jennifer; Carah, Nicholas; Zorbas, Christina; Corben, Kirstan; Saleeba, Emma; Martin, Jane; Peeters, Anna; Backholer, Kathryn",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,585

The questions addressed are these: 1. Can mask use by the general population limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a country? 2. What types of masks exist, and how elaborate must a mask be to be effective against COVID-19? 3. Does the mask have to be applied early in an epidemic? 4. A brief general discussion of masks and some possible future research questions regarding masks and SARS-CoV-2. Results are as follows: (1) The results indicate that any type of mask, even simple home-made ones, may be effective. Masks use seems to have an effect in lowering new patients even the protective effect of each mask (here dubbed""one-mask protection"") is low. Strict adherence to mask use does not appear to be critical. However, increasing the one-mask protection to>50% was found to be advantageous. Masks seemed able to reduce overflow of capacity, e.g. of intensive care. As the default parameters of the software included another intervention, it seems possible to combine mask and other interventions. (2) Masks do seem to reduce the number of new cases even if introduced at a late stage in an epidemic. However, early implementation helps reduce the cumulative and total number of cases. (3) The simulations suggest that it might be possible to eliminate a COVID-19 outbreak by widespread mask use during a limited period.

Thus, these populations remain unreached, and there is a need to establish a method for ensuring the provision of appropriate and adequate healthcare services to these individuals. The portable health clinic (PHC) system has been developed as an effective telemedicine system to meet this objective. A trained village health worker can use this simple system for collecting vital information of the patient, upload the data to the online server, and connect village patients with a remote doctor to enable the provision of online consultancy using video conferencing. Although the PHC was initially developed to ensure primary healthcare service with a focus on non-communicable diseases, a major cause of death, gradually, tele-pathology, tele-eye care, maternal and child health care, and COVID-19 care modules have been added to provide special treatment in these areas as per local needs. The modular PHC system will continue to grow with the addition of novel features that aim to address the local needs. The low-cost and easy operation of the PHC system make it ideal for ensuring global health coverage in communities where inadequate medical facilities and poor-quality healthcare resources remain major issues. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.","Islam-Maruf, R.; Ahmed, A.; Yokota, F.; Kikuchi, K.; Nishikitani, M.; Izukura, R.; Sato, Y.; Nohara, Y.; Nakashim, N.",10th Global Telehealth Conference 2020,,585
308688,Aerosol containment device for use on suspected COVID-19 patients,2020,"Aims: One of the ways to manage the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is to monitor the public knowledge, risk perceptions, adherence to preventive measures, and level of preparedness behaviors. This is important in resource-limited countries. This study determined the knowledge and perception regarding COVID-19; adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures; as well as predictors of self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 among Nigerian adults. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among Nigerian adults &#8805;18 years using an online survey. A convenience sampling method was utilized to recruit a total of 1022 study participants. The participants were recruited using the authors' social media networks. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics at a 5% level of statistical significance. Results: Generally, a high proportion of respondents had correct knowledge about COVID-19. However, only approximately half (49.8% and 49.9%) had correct knowledge that obesity was a risk factor for COVID-19 and that antibiotics cannot be used to treat COVID-19. Most (84.1%) did not have a self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19. Most (81.0%) have been avoiding crowded places and 61.3% washed their hands frequently. Predictors of self-perceived risk of COVID-19 were age 40-59 years (OR 2.05, CI 1.217-3.435), &#8805; 60 years (OR 4.68, CI 1.888-11.583), and visiting crowded places (OR 2.27, CI 1.499-3.448). Conclusion: Our study recommends more rigorous public health education aimed at improving COVID-19 outbreak response in Nigeria. In addition, physical and social distancing should be emphasized across all age groups with additional focus on the older population.","Oyeyemi, Oyetunde T; Oladoyin, Victoria O; Okunlola, Oluyemi A; Mosobalaje, Akinola; Oyeyemi, Ifeoluwa T; Adebimpe, Wasiu O; Nwuba, Roseangela I; Anuoluwa, Iyadunni I; Tiamiyu, Adebisi M; Ovuakporie-Uvo, Oghale O; Adesina, Isaac A; Olatunji, Babawale P; Kone, Jennifer K; Oluwafemi, Yinka D; Obajaja, Caleb O; Ajiboye, Abiodun A",Z Gesundh Wiss,,585

Multiple factors influence the response of the human host on exposure to viral pathogens. Influencing an individual's susceptibility to infection are such factors as nutritional status, physical and psychosocial stressors, obesity, protein-calorie malnutrition, emotional resilience, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, environmental toxins including air pollution and firsthand and secondhand tobacco smoke, sleep habits, sedentary lifestyle, drug-induced nutritional deficiencies and drug-induced immunomodulatory effects, and availability of nutrient-dense food and empty calories. This review examines the network of interacting cofactors that influence the host-pathogen relationship, which in turn determines one's susceptibility to viral infections like COVID-19. It then evaluates the role of machine learning, including predictive analytics and random forest modeling, to help clinicians assess patients' risk for development of active infection and to devise a comprehensive approach to prevention and treatment.","Halamka, John; Cerrato, Paul; Perlman, Adam",Mayo Clin Proc Innov Qual Outcomes,,585

311692,Helmet Modification to PPE With 3D Printing During the COVID-19 Pandemic at Duke University Medical Center: A Novel Technique,2020,"BACKGROUND: Biological considerations suggest that renin-angiotensin system inhibitors might influence the severity of COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate whether continuing versus discontinuing renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers) affects outcomes in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: The REPLACE COVID trial was a prospective, randomised, open-label trial done at 20 large referral hospitals in seven countries worldwide. Eligible participants were aged 18 years and older who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and were receiving a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor before admission. Individuals with contraindications to continuation or discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to continuation or discontinuation of their renin-angiotensin system inhibitor using permuted block randomisation, with allocation concealed using a secure web-based randomisation system. The primary outcome was a global rank score in which participants were ranked across four hierarchical tiers incorporating time to death, duration of mechanical ventilation, time on renal replacement or vasopressor therapy, and multiorgan dysfunction during the hospitalisation. Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. The REPLACE COVID trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04338009. FINDINGS: Between March 31 and Aug 20, 2020, 152 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to either continue or discontinue renin-angiotensin system inhibitor therapy (continuation group n=75; discontinuation group n=77). Mean age of participants was 62 years (SD 12), 68 (45%) were female, mean body-mass index was 33 kg/m2 (SD 8), and 79 (52%) had diabetes. Compared with discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, continuation had no effect on the global rank score (median rank 73 [IQR 40-110] for continuation vs 81 [38-117] for discontinuation; ß-coefficient 8 [95% CI -13 to 29]). There were 16 (21%) of 75 participants in the continuation arm versus 14 (18%) of 77 in the discontinuation arm who required intensive care unit admission or invasive mechanical ventilation, and 11 (15%) of 75 participants in the continuation group versus ten (13%) of 77 in the discontinuation group died. 29 (39%) participants in the continuation group and 28 (36%) participants in the discontinuation group had at least one adverse event (&#967;2 test of adverse events between treatment groups p=0·77). There was no difference in blood pressure, serum potassium, or creatinine during follow-up across the two groups. INTERPRETATION: Consistent with international society recommendations, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors can be safely continued in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.

There is evidence that socio-economic position influences oral health behaviours, but little is known about this association during adolescence. This study aims to investigate the association between social disadvantage (individual- and area-level) and oral health behaviours among Australian adolescents. METHODS: This study utilised data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). The sample consisted of 2877 adolescents. Exposure measures were area-level social disadvantage (Socioeconomic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA)), and parent-reported household income from Wave 5. Outcomes, measured in Wave 6, wereadolescent-reported oral health behaviours: frequency of brushing, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) and dental visits. Associations between quintiles of each exposure and each oral health behaviour were tested by fitting multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Household income and area-level disadvantage were associated with dental visits and brushing frequency. Associations between social disadvantage and consumption of SSBs was less apparent, with only the leastdisadvantaged adolescentshaving lower odds of consumption of SSBs compared to the mostdisadvantaged group. CONCLUSION: Broad population-based strategies must be adopted to reduce intake of SSBs, however targeted strategies are needed among more disadvantaged populations to address infrequent tooth brushing and irregular dental visits among adolescents.","Kaunien, Nadia; Singh, Ankur; King, Tania",Aust. dent. j,,585

Ultrasound, which has become an everyday tool in the ICU, can be very useful during COVID-19 pandemic, since it provides the clinician with information which can be interpreted and integrated within a global assessment during the physical examination. A description of some of the potential applications of ultrasound is depicted in this document, in order to supply the physicians taking care of these patients with an adapted guide to the intensive care setting. Some of its applications since ICU admission include verification of the correct position of the endotracheal tube, contribution to safe cannulation of lines, and identification of complications and thrombotic events. Furthermore, pleural and lung ultrasound can be an alternative diagnostic test to assess the degree of involvement of the lung parenchyma by means of the evaluation of specific ultrasound patterns, identification of pleural effusions and barotrauma.

We aimed to develop and to validate a simple clinical prediction rule for early identification of in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We enrolled 2191 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from three Italian dedicated units (derivation cohort: 1810 consecutive patients from Bergamo and Pavia units; validation cohort: 381 consecutive patients from Rome unit). The outcome was in-hospital mortality. Fine and Gray competing risks multivariate model (with discharge as a competing event) was used to develop a prediction rule for in-hospital mortality. Discrimination and calibration were assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and by Brier score in both the derivation and validation cohorts. Seven variables were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality: age (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.08, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.07-1.09), male sex (HR 1.62, 95%CI 1.30-2.00), duration of symptoms before hospital admission <10 days (HR 1.72, 95%CI 1.39-2.12), diabetes (HR 1.21, 95%CI 1.02-1.45), coronary heart disease (HR 1.40 95% CI 1.09-1.80), chronic liver disease (HR 1.78, 95%CI 1.16-2.72), and lactate dehydrogenase levels at admission (HR 1.0003, 95%CI 1.0002-1.0005). The AUC was 0.822 (95%CI 0.722-0.922) in the derivation cohort and 0.820 (95%CI 0.724-0.920) in the validation cohort with good calibration. The prediction rule is freely available as a web-app (COVID-CALC: https://sites.google.com/community.unipa.it/covid-19riskpredictions/c19-rp).

En l’absence de traitement curatif à ce jour, la prévention est la seule stratégie efficace pour la contrôler. La vaccination est un des piliers de cette prévention. Elle a commencé par les sujets les plus fragiles, les résidents d’établissement d’hébergement pour personnes âgées dépendantes (EHPAD). Ils ont bénéficié des premiers vaccins disponibles à ARN messager depuis le 28 décembre 2020. Ils présentent une immunosénescence physiologique à l’origine habituellement d’une immunité innée moins efficiente et ou d’une immunité adaptative moins durable. Les données concernant cette population âgée particulière sont absentes sur la réponse immunitaire vaccinale et les facteurs (âge, comorbidités, statut nutritionnel) pouvant modifier les réponses du système immunitaire. L’objectif de ce travail est de comparer la qualité de la réponse vaccinale anti-SARS-CoV-2 par rapport à des sujets immunocompétents de 18 à 65 ans. Matériels et méthodes Étude observationnelle prospective monocentrique d’une cohorte de résidents d’EHPAD et d’unités de soins de longue durée de plus de 65 ans d’un centre hospitalo-universitaire français par rapport à des professionnels de santé et du médicosocial de 18 à 65 ans.

This review highlights the current state of knowledge on the viral replication and pathogenicity, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, and management of COVID-19. This review will be of interest to scientists and clinicians and make a significant contribution toward development of vaccines and targeted therapies to contain the pandemic. EXPERT OPINION: The exit strategy for a path back to normal life is required, which should involve a multi-prong effort toward development of new treatment and a successful vaccine to protect public health worldwide and prevent future COVID-19 outbreaks. Therefore, the bench to bedside translational research as well as reverse translational works focusing bedside to bench is very important and would provide the foundation for the development of targeted drugs and vaccines for COVID-19 infections.","Habas, Khaled; Nganwuchu, Chioma; Shahzad, Fanila; Gopalan, Rajendran; Haque, Mainul; Rahman, Sayeeda; Majumder, Anwarul Azim; Nasim, Talat",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,,585
313692,Loneliness Versus Wisdom Amid Two Concurrent Pandemics of Loneliness,2020,"Minority groups are especially vulnerable to the negative psychological and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study focused on one prominent minority group in Israel: ultra-Orthodox Jews. It examined the rate of exposure to COVID-19, adherence to COVID-19 mitigation guidelines, difficulties with adherence to COVID-19 guidelines, COVID-related concerns, financial hardships, the need for help, and microaggression during the first wave of the pandemic (April-May 2020). It then examined multivariate prediction of COVID-related concerns, the need for help, and microaggression. The sample comprised 252 respondents, with 67% female and a mean age of 32.85 (SD = 10.63). Results showed that 78.8% of the participants knew at least one person who had tested positive for COVID-19, and 31.4% knew at least one person who had passed away from COVID-19. Only 59.7% of the participants reported high adherence to social distancing guidelines. Perceived microaggression was predicted by the difficulties with adherence to COVID-19 guidelines, the level of stress associated with exposure to the media, and financial hardships. The study's implications point to the centrality of perceived microaggression and the necessity of adopting culturally sensitive approaches to engage minorities in public efforts to fight the spread of viruses.","Weiden, Faiga; Levinsky, Michal; Schiff, Miriam; Becker, Nati; Pat-Horenczyk, Ruth; Benbenishty, Rami",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,585
314140,Impact of COVID-19 Measures on Electricity Consumption,2020,"PURPOSE: Variation in risk of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with cancer and COVID-19 has been reported from relatively small cohorts. The NCATS' National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) is a centralized data resource representing the largest multicenter cohort of COVID-19 cases and controls nationwide. We aimed to construct and characterize the cancer cohort within N3C and identify risk factors for all-cause mortality from COVID-19. METHODS: We used 4,382,085 patients from 50 US medical centers to construct a cohort of patients with cancer. We restricted analyses to adults &#8805; 18 years old with a COVID-19-positive or COVID-19-negative diagnosis between January 1, 2020, and March 25, 2021. We followed N3C selection of an index encounter per patient for analyses. All analyses were performed in the N3C Data Enclave Palantir platform. RESULTS: A total of 398,579 adult patients with cancer were identified from the N3C cohort; 63,413 (15.9%) were COVID-19-positive. Most common represented cancers were skin (13.8%), breast (13.7%), prostate (10.6%), hematologic (10.5%), and GI cancers (10%). COVID-19 positivity was significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.24). Among COVID-19-positive patients, age &#8805; 65 years, male gender, Southern or Western US residence, an adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index score &#8805; 4, hematologic malignancy, multitumor sites, and recent cytotoxic therapy were associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality. Patients who received recent immunotherapies or targeted therapies did not have higher risk of overall mortality. CONCLUSION: Using N3C, we assembled the largest nationally representative cohort of patients with cancer and COVID-19 to date. We identified demographic and clinical factors associated with increased all-cause mortality in patients with cancer. Full characterization of the cohort will provide further insights into the effects of COVID-19 on cancer outcomes and the ability to continue specific cancer treatments.","Sharafeldin, Noha; Bates, Benjamin; Song, Qianqian; Madhira, Vithal; Yan, Yao; Dong, Sharlene; Lee, Eileen; Kuhrt, Nathaniel; Shao, Yu Raymond; Liu, Feifan; Bergquist, Timothy; Guinney, Justin; Su, Jing; Topaloglu, Umit",J Clin Oncol,,585

314847,COVID-19 and return-to-work recommendations for people with chronic respiratory diseases,2020,"We summarize recent results and ongoing activities in mathematical algorithms and computer science methods related to proton computed tomography (pCT) and intensity-modulated particle therapy (IMPT) treatment planning. Proton therapy necessitates a high level of delivery accuracy to exploit the selective targeting imparted by the Bragg peak. For this purpose, pCT utilizes the proton beam itself to create images. The technique works by sending a low-intensity beam of protons through the patient and measuring the position, direction, and energy loss of each exiting proton. The pCT technique allows reconstruction of the volumetric distribution of the relative stopping power (RSP) of the patient tissues for use in treatment planning and pre-treatment range verification. We have investigated new ways to make the reconstruction both efficient and accurate. Better accuracy of RSP also enables more robust inverse approaches to IMPT. For IMPT, we developed a framework for performing intensity-modulation of the proton pencil beams. We expect that these developments will lead to additional project work in the years to come, which requires a regular exchange between experts in the fields of mathematics, computer science, and medical physics. We have initiated such an exchange by organizing annual workshops on pCT and IMPT algorithm and technology developments. This report is, admittedly, tilted toward our interdisciplinary work and methods. We offer a comprehensive overview of results, problems, and challenges in pCT and IMPT with the aim of making other scientists wanting to tackle such issues and to strengthen their interdisciplinary collaboration by bringing together cutting-edge know-how from medicine, computer science, physics, and mathematics to bear on medical physics problems at hand.","Censor, Yair; Schubert, Keith E.; Schulte, Reinhard W.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09459v1.pdf,585

METHODS: The clinical records of 198 patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders hospitalised in the Dr Rafael Serrano Psychiatric Hospital in Puebla during the peak of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico were analysed for psychiatric or neurologic diagnosis, gender, age, medical diagnosis, and COVID-19 prevalence. For patients with COVID-19, the effects of gender, and medical diagnosis were explored. RESULTS: There was an increased COVID-19 prevalence in the studied population (43.94%), compared with the national Mexican (~0.21% to 0.63%) and worldwide average in the general population (~0.13% to 4.28%). However, the mortality rate (5.75%) was lower than that reported in Mexico (11.28%-13.55%), which was higher than the worldwide average (2.95%-4.98%). We detected increased COVID-19 prevalence in patients with comorbidities (odds ratios [OR] 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2-1, P = .0447). Moreover, patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders have a decreased predisposition to COVID-19 (OR 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.8; P = .0250), as opposed to patients with intellectual disability that are predisposed to COVID-19 (OR 2.2, 95% CI: 0.2-0.8; P = .0434), in comparison with the rest of the hospital population. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of COVID-19 in hospitalised patients with psychiatric disorders is increased compared with that of the general population; however, a lower mortality rate was detected. Also, an increased risk of COVID-19 was detected in patients with comorbidities. Interestingly, the observed variation in COVID-19 prevalence in patients with schizophrenia and intellectual disability was not associated with age or other specific medical diagnoses.","Rivas-Ramírez, Ángel Roberto; Tendilla-Beltrán, Hiram; Gómez-Mendoza, Laura Eréndira; Loaiza, Guillermo; Flores, Gonzalo",Int J Clin Pract,,585

Lockdown disruptions and the rerouting of health funds to the pandemic have impeded access to essential sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and social protection services. Compounded by pre-existing inequalities faced by vulnerable populations, the poor SRH outcomes amid COVID-19 call for CSOs to intensify demand for the accountability of governments. CSOs should also continue to persevere in their aim to rapidly close community-health facility gaps and provide safety nets to mitigate the gendered impact of COVID-19.","Eghtessadi, Rouzeh; Mukandavire, Zindoga; Mutenherwa, Farirai; Cuadros, Diego; Musuka, Godfrey",Int J Infect Dis,,585

SNSs have consequently become deeply rooted in people’s daily lives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, e-learning has become a dominant learning modality to maintain social distancing. Because of the excellent connectivity provided by Internet platforms, SNSs can be leveraged as collaborative learning tools to enhance learning performance. However, conflicts may emerge when extending the socializing function to learning;thus, this topic merits in-depth investigation. One potential reason for the conflicts is the various types of overload caused by the system features, information, communication, and social aspects that users experience, leading to negative emotional responses, such as social network fatigue. Although SNS overloads have been extensively studied, most of these studies were conducted from the perspective of SNSs as platforms for socializing, and the overloads were treated as linear and independent. We apply multi-criteria decision-making tools to bridge the research gaps. Specifically, we recruited 15 active Facebook learning community members as an expert panel under the saturation principle. After extensive pairwise comparisons between the primary constructs and further matrix calculations, our significant research findings include antecedents to social network fatigue and their causal effects, representing a valuable complement to conventional structural equation modeling–approaches. We also discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the study.","Huan-Ming, Chuang",Sustainability,,585

317277,"Changes in Food Consumption During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Analysis of Consumer Survey Data From the First Lockdown Period in Denmark, Germany, and Slovenia",2021,"INTRODUCTION: Gastroenterologists at all levels of practice benefit from formal mentoring. Much of the current literature on mentoring in gastroenterology is based on expert opinion rather than data. In this study, we aimed to identify gender-related barriers to successful mentoring relationships from the mentor and mentee perspectives. METHODS: A voluntary, web-based survey was distributed to physicians at 20 academic institutions across the United States. Overall, 796 gastroenterology fellows and faculty received the survey link, with 334 physicians responding to the survey (42% response rate), of whom 299 (90%; 129 women and 170 men) completed mentorship questions and were included in analysis. RESULTS: Responses of women and men were compared. Compared with men, more women preferred a mentor of the same gender (38.6% women vs 4.2% men, P < 0.0001) but less often had one (45.5% vs 70.2%, P < 0.0001). Women also reported having more difficulty finding a mentor (44.4% vs 16.0%, P < 0.0001) and more often cited inability to identify a mentor of the same gender as a contributing factor (12.8% vs 0.9%, P = 0.0004). More women mentors felt comfortable advising women mentees about work-life balance (88.3% vs 63.8%, P = 0.0005). Nonetheless, fewer women considered themselves effective mentors (33.3% vs 52.6%, P = 0.03). More women reported feeling pressured to mentor because of their gender (39.5% vs 0.9% of men, P < 0.0001). Despite no gender differences, one-third of respondents reported negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their ability to mentor and be mentored. DISCUSSION: Inequities exist in the experiences of women mentees and mentors in gastroenterology, which may affect career advancement and job satisfaction.","Rabinowitz, Loren Galler; Grinspan, Lauren Tal; Zylberberg, Haley M; Dixon, Rebekah; David, Yakira N; Aroniadis, Olga C; Chiang, Austin; Christie, Jennifer; Fayad, Nabil F; Ha, Christina; Harris, Lucinda A; Ko, Cynthia W; Kolb, Jennifer; Kwah, Joann; Lee, Linda; Lieberman, David; Raffals, Laura E; Rex, Douglas K; Shah, Shailja C; Siddiqui, Uzma D; Smith, Michael S; Wallace, Michael; Williams, Renee; Woods, Karen; Crowe, Sheila E; Kumta, Nikhil A; Kim, Michelle Kang; Greenwald, David A",Am. j. gastroenterol.

STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study evaluated all patients admitted for delivery from March 22 to April 18, 2020, at two New York City hospitals. Obstetrical and neonatal outcomes were collected. The relationship between COVID-19 and demographic, clinical, and maternal and neonatal outcome data was evaluated. Demographic data included the number of COVID-19 cases ascertained by ZIP code of residence. Adjusted logistic regression models were performed to determine predictability of demographic risk factors for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 454 women delivered, 79 (17%) had COVID-19. Of those, 27.9% (n = 22) had symptoms such as cough (13.9%), fever (10.1%), chest pain (5.1%), and myalgia (5.1%). While women with COVID-19 were more likely to live in the ZIP codes quartile with the most cases (47 vs. 41%) and less likely to live in the ZIP code quartile with the fewest cases (6 vs. 14%), these comparisons were not statistically significant (p = 0.18). Women with COVID-19 were less likely to have a vaginal delivery (55.2 vs. 51.9%, p = 0.04) and had a significantly longer postpartum length of stay with cesarean (2.00 vs. 2.67days, p < 0.01). COVID-19 was associated with higher risk for diagnoses of chorioamnionitis and pneumonia and fevers without a focal diagnosis. In adjusted analyses, including demographic factors, logistic regression demonstrated a c-statistic of 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69, 0.80). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 symptoms were present in a minority of COVID-19-positive women admitted for delivery. Significant differences in obstetrical outcomes were found. While demographic risk factors demonstrated acceptable discrimination, risk prediction does not capture a significant portion of COVID-19-positive patients. KEY POINTS: · COVID-19 symptoms were present in a minority of COVID-19-positive women admitted.. · COVID-19 symptomatology did not appear to differ before or after the apex of infection in New York.. · Demographic risk factors are unlikely to capture a significant portion of COVID-19-positive patients..","Sutton, Desmond; Wen, Timothy; Staniczenko, Anna P; Huang, Yongmei; Andrikopoulou, Maria; D039,; Alton, Mary; Feinberg, Bruce B; Fuchs, Karin; Goffman, Dena; Gyamfi-Bannerman, Cynthia; Kahe, Ka; Landau, Ruth; Lasky, James A; Miller, Russell; Ntoso, Amma D; Panzer, Alexis; Sheen, Jean-Ju; Simpson, Lynn L; Friedman, Alexander M",Am. j. perinatol,,585

BACKGROUND: Nurses working during the global pandemic are known to be physically and psychologically exhausted, and experience severe anxiety and depression. However, there is a lack of studies comparing anxiety and depression between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 unit nurses. DESIGN: Descriptive research study. METHODS: This study was conducted on 64 nurses who directly worked for more than a month in a COVID-19 unit of a general hospital with nationally designated negative-pressure isolation beds and 64 nurses working in a non-COVID-19 unit. Data were collected through questionnaires and were analysed using SPSS 25.0. Reporting of this research adheres to the STROBE guidelines. RESULTS: Anxiety and depression were significantly higher in nurses working with patients suspected to have COVID-19 rather than nurses working with confirmed COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 patients. Resilience was significantly lower in suspected patient unit nurses than in COVID-19 unit nurses. Anxiety was the major factor predicting depression in both COVID-19 unit (confirmed patients and suspected patients) and non-COVID-19 unit nurses with 76.6%, 80.7%, and 63.6% explanatory power, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Among nurses working in COVID-19 units, suspected patients unit nurses had higher depression than confirmed patients unit nurses due to an unsafe facility environment, insufficient personal protective equipment, and unknown conditions of the patients. Thus, interventions which have a high impact on depression need to be provided to relieve anxiety. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The nursing organisation must provide comprehensive support including coordinated shifts, internal motivation, incentives, up-to-date information, and clear infection prevention guidelines to relieve anxiety caused by exhaustive workload, uncertainty of infectious diseases, and lack of human and material resources.","Doo, Eun-Young; Kim, Miyoung; Lee, Soyoung; Lee, Su Young; Lee, Ka Young",J. clin. nurs,,585

This systematic review aimed to synthesise the available literature on the delivery on maternal and neonatal health interventions in conflict settings. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases using terms related to conflict, women and children, and maternal and neonatal health. We searched websites of 10 humanitarian organisations for relevant grey literature. Publications reporting on conflict-affected populations in low-income and middle-income countries and describing a maternal or neonatal health intervention delivered during or within 5 years after the end of a conflict were included. Information on population, intervention, and delivery characteristics were extracted and narratively synthesised. Quantitative data on intervention coverage and effectiveness were tabulated but no meta-analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: 115 publications met our eligibility criteria. Intervention delivery was most frequently reported in the sub-Saharan Africa region, and most publications focused on displaced populations based in camps. Reported maternal interventions targeted antenatal, obstetric and postnatal care; neonatal interventions focused mostly on essential newborn care. Most interventions were delivered in hospitals and clinics, by doctors and nurses, and were mostly delivered through non-governmental organisations or the existing healthcare system. Delivery barriers included insecurity, lack of resources and lack of skilled health staff. Multi-stakeholder collaboration, the introduction of new technology or systems innovations, and staff training were delivery facilitators. Reporting of intervention coverage or effectiveness data was limited. DISCUSSION: The relevant existing literature focuses mostly on maternal health especially around the antenatal period. There is still limited literature on postnatal care in conflict settings and even less on newborn care. In crisis settings, as much as in non-crisis settings, there is a need to focus on the first day of birth for both maternal and neonatal health. There is also a need to do more research on how best to involve community members in the delivery of maternal and neonatal health interventions.

319811,Report on Digital Literacy in Academic Meetings during the 2020 COVID-19 Lockdown,2020,"The world is facing a global crisis and health emergency of COVID-19. Understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology in ayurvedic host centric framework is prerequisite for apt use of Ayurveda. This paper reviews COVID-19 pathophysiology, clinical presentations and prognosis in ayurvedic perspective. Concept of exogenous pathogenic diseases can be traced in fever, microbes, toxins, epidemics and seasonal regimens chapters of Ayurveda. Such exogenous diseases later manifest multi-system presentation according to involvement of different 'Dosha' and derangement of 'Agni'. The pathology of COVID-19 is primarily that of Sannipata Jwara (fever) with involvement of respiratory system. Secondary manifestations include coagulopathies, cardiovascular, neural, and renal complications. Gastrointestinal system is closely associated with respiratory mechanism in ayurvedic pathophysiological conceptualization of Srotas. Abnormal immune responses in COVID-19 are result of abnormalities of Tridosha, Rakta (blood) and Ojus (Vital nectar). The initial phase is Vata-Kapha dominant whereas later stage of aggravated immune response is Vata-Pitta dominant. Alveolar damage, coagulopathies indicate Rakta dhatu vitiation. This integrative understanding of COVID-19, we can propose novel strategies for therapeutics and prophylaxis. Measures for 'Conservation of Agni-bala', 'Attainment of Rakta- Pitta-Prana homeostasis and 'Protection of Tri-Marma i.e. vital organs' can be important Host based strategies for reduction in the mortality in COVID-19 and for better clinical outcomes. This host centric approach can make paradigm shift in management of this epidemic.","Dilip Pandkar, Prasad; Sachdeva, Vinay",,,585

320488,"An Overview of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Risk Assessment, July, 2020",2020,"INTRODUCTION: The response to the COVID-19 pandemic became increasingly politicized in the U.S., and the political affiliation of state leaders may contribute to policies affecting the spread of the disease. This study examines the differences in COVID-19 infection, death, and testing by governor party affiliation across the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. METHODS: A longitudinal analysis was conducted in December 2020 examining COVID-19 incidence, death, testing, and test positivity rates from March 15, 2020 through December 15, 2020. A Bayesian negative binomial model was fit to estimate the daily risk ratios and posterior intervals comparing rates by gubernatorial party affiliation. The analyses adjusted for state population density, rurality, Census region, age, race, ethnicity, poverty, number of physicians, obesity, cardiovascular disease, asthma, smoking, and presidential voting in 2020. RESULTS: From March 2020 to early June 2020, Republican-led states had lower COVID-19 incidence rates than Democratic-led states. On June 3, 2020, the association reversed, and Republican-led states had a higher incidence (risk ratio=1.10, 95% posterior interval=1.01, 1.18). This trend persisted through early December 2020. For death rates, Republican-led states had lower rates early in the pandemic but higher rates from July 4, 2020 (risk ratio=1.18, 95% posterior interval=1.02, 1.31) through mid-December 2020. Republican-led states had higher test positivity rates starting on May 30, 2020 (risk ratio=1.70, 95% posterior interval=1.66, 1.73) and lower testing rates by September 30, 2020 (risk ratio=0.95, 95% posterior interval=0.90, 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Gubernatorial party affiliation may drive policy decisions that impact COVID-19 infections and deaths across the U.S. Future policy decisions should be guided by public health considerations rather than by political ideology.","Neelon, Brian; Mutiso, Fedelis; Mueller, Noel T; Pearce, John L; Benjamin-Neelon, Sara E",Am J Prev Med,,585

METHODS: The PRIORITY (Pregnancy CoRonavIrus Outcomes RegIsTrY) study is an ongoing nationwide prospective cohort study of people in the United States who are pregnant or up to 6 weeks postpregnancy with known or suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We analyzed the clinical presentation and disease course of COVID-19 in participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and reported symptoms at the time of testing. RESULTS: Of 991 participants enrolled from March 22, 2020, until July 10, 2020, 736 had symptoms of COVID-19 at the time of testing; 594 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and 142 tested negative in this symptomatic group. Mean age was 31.3 years (SD 5.1), and 37% will nulliparous. Ninety-five percent were outpatients. Participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-infection were a geographically diverse cohort: 34% from the Northeast, 25% from the West, 21% from the South, and 18% from the Midwest. Thirty-one percent of study participants were Latina, and 9% were Black. The average gestational age at enrollment was 24.1 weeks, and 13% of participants were enrolled after pregnancy. The most prevalent first symptoms in the cohort of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were cough (20%), sore throat (16%), body aches (12%), and fever (12%). Median time to symptom resolution was 37 days (95% CI 35-39). One quarter (25%) of participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection had persistent symptoms 8 or more weeks after symptom onset.

321472,Changes in local travel behaviour before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong,2021,"Driven by the fast spread of private irrigation pumps, there has been a rapid expansion of intensive vegetable cultivation in the central Rift Valley in Ethiopia, making it the most important commercial vegetable production cluster in the country. Supporting that ""quiet revolution"" has been an inflow of migrant laborers-paid through daily, monthly, or piecemeal contracts, with few employment benefits attached to them-and a gig economy as widely used contractors organize, among others, mechanized land preparation, the digging of wells and ponds, seedling propagation, and loading of trucks. Almost 60% of the irrigated area is cultivated by medium-scale tenant farmers relying on short-term rental contracts. It seems that gig economies characterized by flexible contract arrangements implemented by outside contractors, which are increasingly fueling sophisticated sectors in developed countries, are important in these commercial agrarian settings in Africa as well. We further find that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant disruptions of this model, as seen by more limited access to services and the unavailability or high price increases in factor markets, especially for labor, and large but heterogenous price changes in output markets.","Minten, Bart; Mohammed, Belay; Tamru, Seneshaw",Eur J Dev Res,,585

A disturbing trend is that Black, Indigenous, and/or People of Color (BIPOC) are disproportionately contracting coronavirus, as well as dying from COVID-19. Objective/Methods The pandemic has the potential to entrench and magnify existing health disparities and families marginalized across multiple demographic intersections such as race/ethnicity, class, immigration status, are especially vulnerable. These inequities have been further underscored by the recent murders of Black Americans by police and a resulting spotlight on racial injustice in the United States. Results Efforts to lessen the spread of the virus, have resulted in changes in pediatric primary and subspecialty service delivery which may affect access for BIPOC communities. BIPOC trainees including those with debt or caregiving responsibilities may be faced with new barriers resulting in delays in completion of their training. Further, clinical, community-based, and translational research has been disrupted by heightened safety precautions and social distancing which may affect BIPOC representation in research downstream. Conclusion In our roles as clinicians, supervisors, trainees, and researchers in primary and subspecialty care as well as in academia, pediatric psychologists have an ethical responsibility to address the disproportionate burden of this pandemic on vulnerable communities and to allocate our time and resources to ensuring health equity now and in the aftermath of COVID-19.","Valenzuela, Jessica; Crosby, Lori E; Harrison, Roger R",J Pediatr Psychol,,585

With no clear remedies to treat the disease, doctors are repurposing drugs like chloroquine and remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients. In parallel, research institutes in collaboration with biotech companies have identified strategies to use viral proteins as vaccine candidates for COVID-19. Although this looks promising, they still need to pass the test of challenge studies in animal models. As various models for SARS-CoV-2 are under testing phase, biotech companies have bypassed animal studies and moved to Phase I clinical trials. In view of the present outbreak, this looks a justified approach, but the problem is that in the absence of animal studies, we can never predict the outcomes in humans. Since animal models are critical for vaccine development and SARS-CoV-2 has different transmission dynamics, in this review we compare different animal models of SARS-CoV-2 with humans for their pathogenic, immune response and transmission dynamics that make them ideal models for vaccine testing for COVID-19. Another issue of using animal model is the ethics of using animals for research; thus, we also discuss the pros and cons of using animals for vaccine development studies.","Deb, Bijayeeta; Shah, Hemal; Goel, Suchi",J.

The outbreak spread rapidly within mainland China and globally. This paper reviews the different imaging modalities used in the diagnosis and treatment process of COVID-19, such as chest radiography, computerized tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound examination, and positron emission tomography (PET/CT) scan. A chest radiograph is not recommended as a first-line imaging modality for COVID-19 infection due to its lack of sensitivity, especially in the early stages of infection. Chest CT imaging is reported to be a more reliable, rapid, and practical method for diagnosis of COVID-19, and it can assess the severity of the disease and follow up the disease time course. Ultrasound, on the other hand, is portable and involves no radiation, and thus can be used in critically ill patients to assess cardiorespiratory function, guide mechanical ventilation, and identify the presence of deep venous thrombosis and secondary pulmonary thromboembolism. Supplementary information can be provided by PET/CT. In the absence of vaccines and treatments for COVID-19, prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential. Therefore, it is important to exploit the advantages of different imaging modalities in the fight against COVID-19.","Jiang, Zhen-Zhen; He, Cong; Wang, De-Qing; Shen, Hua-Liang; Sun, Jia-Li; Gan, Wan-Ni; Lu, Jia-Ying; Liu, Xia-Tian",Med Sci Monit,,585

The aim of this study was to compare COVID-19-related outcomes between pregnant and non-pregnant women after adjusting for potential risk factors for severe outcomes. METHODS: Data were obtained from the COVID-19 National Data Registry of Mexico, which is an ongoing prospective cohort of people of any age with clinically suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and admitted to 475 monitoring hospitals. This study included pregnant and non-pregnant women of reproductive age (15-45 years) with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. To adjust for underlying risk factors, propensity score matching was conducted for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, smoking, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, chronic renal disease, immunosuppression, age, language, nationality and level of health insurance. The primary outcome was death. Secondary outcomes were pneumonia, intubation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 5183 pregnant and 175 905 non-pregnant women with COVID-19. The crude (unmatched) rates of death, pneumonia, intubation and ICU admission in pregnant compared with non-pregnant women were 1.5% vs 1.5%, 9.9% vs 6.5%, 8.1% vs 9.9% and 13.0% vs 6.9%, respectively. After propensity score matching (5183 pregnant and 5183 non-pregnant matched women), pregnant women had a higher odds of death (odds ratio (OR), 1.84; 95% CI, 1.26-2.69), pneumonia (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.60-2.16) and ICU admission (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.41-2.45) than non-pregnant women, but similar odds of intubation (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.70-1.25). CONCLUSION: After adjusting for background demographic and medical factors, pregnancy is a risk factor for death, pneumonia and ICU admission in SARS-CoV-2-infected women of reproductive age.

Then, the collected survey data were analyzed using the structural equation model. The verification of the statistical analysis results indicates that the course structure has a more significant effect on the student satisfaction and achievement than the other key factors such as the student–student interaction, instructor presence and student engagement. It also reveals that the student engagement affects only the student satisfaction and has a mediated effect between student–student interaction and student satisfaction.","Kim, Sohee",Sustainability,,585

In our study we reviewed the current knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 cases in PLWHA. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted by searching the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases. Studies reporting data on PLWHA affected by SARS-CoV-2 were considered for inclusion. The aim of this study was the systematic characterization of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection among PLWHA, particularly focusing on age, clinical findings at diagnosis, radiological features, therapeutic management and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty three relevant articles were identified, which reported 164 adults with both HIV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those, the large majority were males (120/142, 84.5%), often with one or more comorbidities. Fifteen cases needed intensive care treatment and 16 died. For each group, respectively three patients had underlying comorbidities. There were no studies on children. The included studies were mostly retrospective or case series/reports (19 studies). The overall risk of bias was moderate, due to the study types and characteristics. CONCLUSION: It is still unclear if HIV infection may influence SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease course, however some PLWHA and particularly males affected by ARV-related complications may be at greater risk of severe Covid-19 course.","Costenaro, Paola; Minotti, Chiara; Barbieri, Elisa; Giaquinto, Carlo; Donà, Daniele",Rev Med Virol,,585

RESULTS: 64.5% of the sample stated that they absolutely would accept the vaccination, 13.8% would rather accept it, 10.4% were undecided, and 5.2% would rather not and 6.0% absolutely not get vaccinated. COVID-19-related anxiety, and fears of infection and health-related consequences correlated significantly positively with vaccine acceptance (all p < .001). In contrast, social (p = .006) and economic fears (p < .001) showed significant negative associations with vaccination willingness. The broader constructs of unspecific anxiety and depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with vaccine acceptance. Vaccine acceptance differed between users/non-users of social media and official websites to gain information about the pandemic (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-related anxiety and health-related fears were associated with higher vaccine acceptance, whereas the fear of social and economic consequences showed the contrary direction. These findings highlight the need to differentiate between several types of fears and anxiety to predict their influence on vaccine acceptance, and provide important information and an essential base for future studies and interventions.","Bendau, Antonia; Plag, Jens; Petzold, Moritz Bruno; Ströhle, Andreas",Int Immunopharmacol,,585
324773,Avoiding the Crowd: Traveller Behaviour in Public Transport in the Age of COVID-19,2021-04-22,"BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has been responsible for the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, uses the cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike (S) protein priming Meanwhile, the presence of B(0)AT1 (SLC6A19) may prevent TMPRSS2 from accessing the cutting position on ACE2 Identifying the expression of these cell receptor-related genes of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in various tissues, especially in the kidney METHODS: The single-cell transcription datasets of the human cell landscape (HCL) and other relevant single-cell transcription databases were used to analyze the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and SLC6A19 in various organs and tissues, but mainly in the kidney RESULTS: ACE2 was significantly expressed in the S1, S2, and S3 segments of proximal tubule (PT) cells TMPRSS2 was widely expressed in several renal tubule populations extending from the PT cells to the collection system cell type, of which intercalated cells and the distal convoluted tubule cells showed more significant expression than PT cells Unexpectedly, although expressed on various renal tubule populations, SLC6A19 was mainly enriched in PT cells, in line with ACE2 expression Although alveolar-type (AT) 2 cells of the lung and intestinal epithelial cells expressed ACE2 as well as PT cells, AT 2 cells significantly expressed TMPRSS2 but not SLC6A19, while all 3 genes were significantly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells CONCLUSIONS: ACE2 was widely expressed in specific cell subgroups of various human tissues, especially in intestinal epithelial cells, kidney PT cells, and also AT 2 cells of the lung These 3 types of cells demonstrated significant differences in the distribution of the cell receptor-related genes of SARS-CoV-2, which may indicate the diversity of cell surface structures and differences in the affinity between SARS-CoV-2 and cells","Chen, Q.

325422,Methodology for risk assessment of COVID-19 pandemic propagation,2021,"Severely ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients show elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, a situation commonly known as a cytokine storm. The p38 MAPK receptor is considered a plausible therapeutic target because of its involvement in the platelet activation processes leading to inflammation. This study aimed to identify potential natural product-derived inhibitory molecules against the p38&#945; MAPK receptor to mitigate the eliciting of pro-inflammatory cytokines using computational techniques. The 3D X-ray structure of the receptor with PDB ID 3ZS5 was energy minimized using GROMACS and used for molecular docking via AutoDock Vina. The molecular docking was validated with an acceptable area under the curve (AUC) of 0.704, which was computed from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A compendium of 38,271 natural products originating from Africa and China together with eleven known p38 MAPK inhibitors were screened against the receptor. Four potential lead compounds ZINC1691180, ZINC5519433, ZINC4520996 and ZINC5733756 were identified. The compounds formed strong intermolecular bonds with critical residues Val38, Ala51, Lys53, Thr106, Leu108, Met109 and Phe169. Additionally, they exhibited appreciably low binding energies which were corroborated via molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) calculations. The compounds were also predicted to have plausible pharmacological profiles with insignificant toxicity. The molecules were also predicted to be anti-inflammatory, kinase inhibitors, antiviral, platelet aggregation inhibitors, and immunosuppressive, with probable activity (Pa) greater than probable inactivity (Pi). ZINC5733756 is structurally similar to estradiol with a Tanimoto coefficient value of 0.73, which exhibits anti-inflammatory activity by targeting the activation of Nrf2. Similarly, ZINC1691180 has been reported to elicit anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. The compounds may serve as scaffolds for the design of potential biotherapeutic molecules against the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19.","Asiedu, Seth O; Kwofie, Samuel K; Broni, Emmanuel; Wilson, Michael D",Biomolecules,,585

Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes serious vomiting and diarrhea in suckling piglets. In this study, the role of Ca2+ to PDCoV infection was investigated. PDCoV infection was found to upregulate intracellular Ca2+ concentrations of IPI-2I cells. Chelating extracellular Ca2+ by EGTA inhibited PDCoV replication, and this inhibitory effect was overcome by replenishment with CaCl2. Treatment with Ca2+ channel blockers, particularly the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker diltiazem hydrochloride, inhibited PDCoV infection significantly. Mechanistically, diltiazem hydrochloride reduces PDCoV infection by inhibiting the replication step of the viral replication cycle. Additionally, knockdown of CACNA1S, the L-type Ca2+ voltage-gated channel subunit, inhibited PDCoV replication. The combined results demonstrate that PDCoV modulates calcium influx to favor its replication.","Bai, Dongcheng; Fang, Liurong; Xia, Sijin; Ke, Wenting; Wang, Jing; Wu, Xiaoli; Fang, Puxian; Xiao, Shaobo",Virology,,585

OBJECTIVES: To study the increasing divergence between targeted and achieved distractions observed with magnetically controlled growing rod (MCGR)lengthening, and the relationship of this reduced rate of achieved lengthening with remaining rod length. METHODS: Patients with early onset scoliosis (EOS) who underwent MCGRs with minimum 2-year follow-up were consecutively enrolled. Targeted and achieved lengths were compared. Correlation between percentage of lengthening achieved from targeted length was identified with the timing of rod exchanges. RESULTS: A total of 20 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean age at index surgery was 9.5 years and mean postoperative follow-up was 68 ± 28 months. Of these, 8 patients had at least one rod exchange that occurred at 23 ± 4 months. A decrease in rate of achieved lengthening was observed when compared with targeted distractions. The achieved lengthening drops from 86% of targeted length at the first distraction to only 58.8% at the 21st distraction episode for the first set of rods. After rod exchange, the average achieved lengthening went back up to 81.3% of the targeted length but subsequently had a gradual reduction to 35% at the 19th distraction episode. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a ""law of temporary diminishing distraction gains"" that MCGR users should be aware of when monitoring rod lengthening. Diminishing distraction length gains is observed as the rod is lengthened and is a phenomenon independent of patient factors. It is only temporary as the rates of achieved lengthening returns to baseline after rod exchange.","Cheung, Jason Pui Yin; Bow, Cora; Cheung, Kenneth M C",Global Spine J,,585

However, a unique presentation of a transient form of hepatitis in pediatric age group occurring subsequent to the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is yet to be reported in children. Presently the clinical work, temporal association and characteristics different than MIS-C, of the cases of CAHC is being dealt with. MethodsAs a retrospective and follow up observational study we reviewed all pediatric patients presenting with acute hepatitis during the study period from April 2021 to mid-June 2021. We observed a sudden rise of features of hepatitis in a group of pediatric patients during the second wave of SARS CoV-2 infections, where ""children or adolescents developing sudden onset acute hepatitis with no history of pre-existing liver disease in the absence of familiar etiology of acute hepatitis and with a recent 3-6week history of RT-PCR positivity or a retrospectively proven Covid-19 infection with high titer SARS CoV-2 antibodies"". Such patients had asymptomatic Covid-19 infection, while another very small group (n=8) patients having findings similar to MIS-C was identified with protracted and grave presentation, having multiple organ involvement along withCovid-19 diagnosis. Routine lab workup along with viral serology of acute hepatitis was performed in all such patients. These patients were negative for Hepatitis A, B, C and E but had high titer of SARS CoV-2 antibodies. ResultsAmong 33 patients who presented with hepatitis, 25 patients showed unique features of CAHC, they had hepatitis only. These patients did not have any typical Covid-19 symptoms, had normal to borderline inflammatory markers, with admission to general care wards, all recovered on supportive treatment without any complications or mortality. Whereas patients with MIS-C (n=8) required admission to critical care, they had high level of inflammatory markers and 3 (37.5%) had an adverse outcome. ConclusionWith emergence of newer variants of concern such as the Delta variant which caused the massive wave ofCovid-19 in India, with varied presentations, CAHC is one of them. Such new entities need to be timely identified and differentiated from other types of emerging syndromes in children for appropriate management.","Rawat, Sumit K; Asati, Ajit anand; Jain, Ashish; Ratho, Radha Kant",,,585

In a follow-up study to our recent findings indicating the potential of Cannabidiol (CBD) in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), here we show for the first time that CBD may ameliorate the symptoms of ARDS through up-regulation of apelin, a peptide with significant role in the central and peripheral regulation of immunity, CNS, metabolic and cardiovascular system. By administering intranasal Poly (I:C), a synthetic viral dsRNA, while we were able to mimic the symptoms of ARDS in a murine model, interestingly, there was a significant decrease in the expression of apelin in both blood and lung tissues. CBD treatment was able to reverse the symptoms of ARDS towards a normal level. Importantly, CBD treatment increased the apelin expression significantly, suggesting a potential crosstalk between apelinergic system and CBD may be the therapeutic target in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as COVID-19 and many other pathologic conditions.","Salles, Évila Lopes; Khodadadi, Hesam; Jarrahi, Abbas; Ahluwalia, Meenakshi; Paffaro, Valdemar Antonio; Costigliola, Vincenzo; Yu, Jack C; Hess, David C; Dhandapani, Krishnan M; Baban, Babak",J Cell Mol Med,,585

OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to differentiate the opinions related to coronavirus vaccination (acceptance, refusal, ignorance, hesitation). We analyzed advantages and disadvantages of vaccination, and the different channels in getting information about the vaccine. METHOD: Our study is part of the ""Longitudinal examination of mental factors caused by the coronavirus epidemic"" research project, wave of December 2020. We analyzed the responses of 1009 people by one-way analysis of variance tests. RESULTS: Our results show that elder people, males, and those who have higher education are more likely to accept the vaccine. In addition, those who live in Budapest and Cental Hungary are more likely to choose vaccination against the coronavirus than those living in other areas. The groups with different opinions on vaccination are better discriminated by benefit-related than risk-related opinions. Those benefit-related items showed the largest variance between groups, which focused on social usefulness on curbing the epidemics, preventing the spread of the infection. Analyzing the sources of information, we found that all groups rely more on personal (family, friends) and medical health information than on news from the media. CONCLUSION: The opinions of the vaccination groups differ mostly regarding the positive benefits of vaccination, especially the social usefulness. Opinions are mostly formed through personal relationships including relations with healthcare workers. Healthcare professionals therefore have a key role in providing a differentiated understanding of those seeking advice, providing expert information and appropriate advice.

332095,Dynamics of Local Epidemic Covid-19 Outbreak through the Prism of Compartment Modeling,2020,"The novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are new global problems. The understanding of the host immune response in COVID-19 and its implications in the development of therapeutic agents are new challenges. Here, we evaluated the development of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralizing (Nt) antibodies in symptomatic hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We followed up 117 COVID-19 confirmed patients from a reference health center for COVID-19 during the epidemic in Santiago de Chile. One and two sequential blood samples from 117 to 68 cases were, respectively, obtained to evaluate the immune response. Immunofluorescence and neutralization assays in Vero E6 cells with a Chilean SARS-CoV-2 strain were performed. Out of the 68 patients, 44% were women and 56% men, and the most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (47.7%) and diabetes (27.4%). The most frequent symptoms or signs related to COVID-19 were dyspnea, cough, fever, myalgia, and headache. In all the study population, 76.1% and 60.7% of patients were positive for IgG and Nt antibodies in the first blood sample. All patients except one were positive for IgG and Nt antibodies in the second sample. IgG and Nt antibodies positivity increased significantly according to the disease evolution periods. Higher Nt antibody titers were observed in the first sample in patients under 60 years of age. Obese and diabetic patients had no increase in Nt antibodies, unlike normal weight and diabetes-free patients. Both hypertensive and normotensive patients showed a significant increase in Nt antibodies. These results show an early and robust immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection during severe COVID-19.","Teresa Valenzuela, María; Urquidi, Cinthya; Rodriguez, Nicolás; Castillo, Luis; Fernández, Jorge; Ramírez, Eugenio",J. med. virol,,585

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted. Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 admitted to the Eighth People's Hospital of Guangzhou from January 21st to February 24th 2020 were enrolled. According to the clinical classification, the patients were divided into severe group and critical group. The myocardial injury markers, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), cardiac troponin I (cTnI), myoglobin (MYO), MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK-MB), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 55 COVID-19 patients were selected, including 15 critical cases and 40 severe cases. The patients with severe and critical COVID-19 were male-dominated (61.8%), the average age was (61.2±13.0) years old, 83.6% (46 cases) of them had contact history of Hubei, 38.2% (21 cases) of them were complicated with hypertension. There was no significant difference in baseline data between the critical group and the severe group. Myocardial injury markers of critical and severe COVID-19 patients were increased in different proportion, LDH increased in most patients (20 severe cases and 7 critical cases), followed by AST (16 severe cases and 5 critical cases). There was significant difference in the number of patients with elevated CK between severe group and critical group (cases: 1 vs. 4, P = 0.027). Abnormal ECG was found in 39 of 42 patients with ECG examination. Nonspecific change of T wave was the most common. Before and after treatment, 9 of 15 patients with changes of ECG and myocardial injury markers had oxygenation index less than 100 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), and the prominent changes of ECG were heart rate increasing and ST-T change. CONCLUSIONS: The increase of myocardial injury markers and abnormal ECG were not specific to the myocardial injury of severe and critical COVID-19 patients. At the same time, the dynamic changes of myocardial injury markers and ECG could reflect the situation of myocardial damage.","Tong, Yuwei; Xie, Zhiwei; Li, Yueping; Lyu, Mingfang; Deng, Xilong; Zhang, Fuchun; Lei, Chunliang",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,,585
332827,Impact of COVID-19 on Emerging Markets,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic remains uncontrolled despite the rapid rollout of safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, underscoring the need to develop highly effective antivirals. In the setting of waning immunity from infection and vaccination, breakthrough infections are becoming increasingly common and treatment options remain limited. Additionally, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with their potential to escape therapeutic monoclonal antibodies emphasizes the need to develop second-generation oral antivirals targeting highly conserved viral proteins that can be rapidly deployed to outpatients. Here, we demonstrate the in vitro antiviral activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of GS-621763, an orally bioavailable prodrug of GS-441524, the parental nucleoside of remdesivir, which targets the highly conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. GS-621763 exhibited significant antiviral activity in lung cell lines and two different human primary lung cell culture systems. The dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile observed after oral administration of GS-621763 translated to dose-dependent antiviral activity in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic GS-621763 significantly reduced viral load, lung pathology, and improved pulmonary function in COVID-19 mouse model. A direct comparison of GS-621763 with molnupiravir, an oral nucleoside analog antiviral currently in human clinical trial, proved both drugs to be similarly efficacious. These data demonstrate that therapy with oral prodrugs of remdesivir can significantly improve outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice. Thus, GS-621763 supports the exploration of GS-441524 oral prodrugs for the treatment of COVID-19 in humans.","Schafer, Alexandra; Martinez, David R; Won, John J; Moreira, Fernanado R; Brown, Ariane J; Gully, Kendra L; Kalla, Rao; Chun, Kwon; Pont, Venice Du; Babusis, Darius; Tang, Jennifer; Murakami, Eisuke; Subramanian, Raju; Barrett, Kimberly T; Bleier, Blake J.; Bannister, Roy; Feng, Joy Y.; Bilello, John P.; Cihlar, Tomas; Mackman, Richard L.; Montgomery, Stephanie A.; Baric, Ralph S.; Sheahan, Timothy P.",,,585
332874,The impact of COVID-19 preventive lockdowns on the prevalence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo./ El impacto de la cuarentena preventiva por COVID-19 sobre la prevalencia de vértigo posicional paroxístico benigno,2021,"Objective: This study aimed to identify the predictive value of simple markers in routine blood and coagulation tests for the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: A total of 311 consecutive COVID-19 patients, including 281 patients with mild/moderate COVID-19 and 30 patients with severe/life-threatening COVID-19, were retrospectively enrolled. Logistic modeling and ROC curve analyses were used to assess the indexes for identifying disease severity. Results: Lymphocyte and eosinophil counts of COVID-19 patients in the severe/life-threatening group were significantly lower than those of patients in the mild/moderate group (P < 0.001). Coagulation parameters, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels and procalcitonin levels were higher in the severe/life-threatening group compared with the mild/moderate group (all P < 0.05). Univariate and multivariate logistic models revealed that hsCRP and fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs) were predictors of severe COVID-19 (OR = 1.072, P = 0.036; and OR = 1.831, P = 0.036, respectively). The AUROCs of hsCRP and FDP for predicting severe/life-threatening COVID-19 were 0.850 and 0.766, respectively. The optimal cutoffs of hsCRP and FDP for the severe/life-threatening type of COVID-19 were 22.41 mg/L and 0.95 µg/ml, respectively. Conclusion: Serum CRP and FDP levels are positively related to the severity of COVID-19. This finding indicates that CRP and FDP levels may potentially be used as early predictors for severe illness and help physicians triage numerous patients in a short time.","Ding, Rongrong; Yang, Zongguo; Huang, Dan; Wang, Yanbing; Li, Xiufen; Zhou, Xinlan; Yan, Li; Lu, Wei; Zhang, Zhanqing",Int J Med Sci,,585

333394,Urology in times of pandemic,2020,"SHOX haploinsufficiency causes 70-90% of Léri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD) and 2-10% of idiopathic short stature (ISS). Deletions removing the entire gene or enhancers and point mutations in the coding region represent a well-established cause of haploinsufficiency. During diagnostic genetic testing on ISS/LWD patients, in addition to classic SHOX defects, five 5'UTR variants (c.-58G > T, c.-55C > T, c.-51G > A, c.-19G > A, and c.-9del), were detected whose pathogenetic role was unclear and were thus classified as VUS (Variants of Uncertain Significance). The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of these noncoding variations in SHOX haploinsufficiency. The variants were tested for their ability to interfere with correct gene expression of a regulated reporter gene (luciferase assay). The negative effect on the mRNA splicing predicted in silico for c.-19G > A was assayed in vitro through a minigene splicing assay. The luciferase assay showed that c.-51G > A, c.-19G > A, and c.-9del significantly reduce luciferase activity by 60, 35, and 40% at the homozygous state. Quantification of the luciferase mRNA showed that c.-51G > A and c.-9del might interfere with the correct SHOX expression mainly at the post-transcriptional level. The exon trapping assay demonstrated that c.-19G > A determines the creation of a new branch site causing an aberrant mRNA splicing. In conclusion, this study allowed us to reclassify two of the 5'UTR variants identified during SHOX diagnostic screening as likely pathogenic, one remains as a VUS, and two as likely benign variants. This analysis for the first time expands the spectrum of the genetic causes of SHOX haploinsufficiency to noncoding variations in the 5'UTR.","Babu, Deepak; Vannelli, Silvia; Fanelli, Antonella; Mellone, Simona; Baffico, Ave Maria; Corrado, Lucia; Essa, Wael Al; Grandone, Anna; Bellone, Simonetta; Monzani, Alice; Vinci, Giulia; De Sanctis, Luisa; Stuppia, Liborio; Prodam, Flavia; Giordano, Mara",Eur. j. hum. genet,,585

This study, performed between April and May 2020, aimed to investigate the effect of restricted partners' visiting policies on non-infected mother's anxiety symptoms, the perceived postpartum support, and the breastfeeding outcomes at discharge. A cross-sectional study was conducted in a neonatal tertiary referral center in northern Italy during Italy's lockdown. We enrolled mothers with a negative nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), adequate oral and written comprehension of the Italian language, and absence of underlying maternal or neonatal clinical conditions. Maternal anxiety levels were assessed through the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form Y (STAI-Y). Maternal perception of staff's support was evaluated by the Nurse Parent Support Tool (NPST). A STATE-A (concurrent emotional state after a specific situation) score &#8805; 40 was considered indicative of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety. A total of 109 mothers completed the study. Mean STATE-A score was &#8805;40 in 42% of mothers, and median NPST score was 4.23. Mothers separated from their partner had a mean STATE-A score &#8805; 40 in a higher percentage of cases than those who were not (51% vs. 30%, p = 0.03) and a lower perception of caregiver support. A NPST score &#8804;4.23, partner 's absence during the hospital stay and primiparity were independently associated with a STATE-A score &#8805; 40. Breastfeeding rates at discharge were not influenced by maternal anxiety levels and partner's restricted policies. Instead, they were influenced by mode of delivery, a well-known risk factor, and pre-pandemic intention to breastfeed. Our study demonstrates the positive impact of a partner's presence on maternal mental health and perception of caregiver support.","Morniroli, Daniela; Consales, Alessandra; Colombo, Lorenzo; Bezze, Elena Nicoletta; Zanotta, Lidia; Plevani, Laura; Fumagalli, Monica; Mosca, Fabio; Giannì, Maria Lorella",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,585
333923,Considerations on the restriction of assisted reproductive technology (ART) due to COVID-19. (Special Issue: COVID preparedness: lessons learned from the pandemic center: issue 2.),2020,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has generated multiple psychological stressors, which may increase the prevalence of depressive symptoms. Utilizing Canadian survey data, this study assessed household- and employment-related risk factors for depressive symptoms during the pandemic. METHODS: A sample of 1005 English-speaking Canadian adults aged 18+ years completed a web-based survey after physical distancing measures were implemented across Canada. Hierarchical binary logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations of depressive symptoms with household- (household size, presence of children, residence locale) and employment-related (job with high risk of COVID-19 exposure, working from home, laid off/not working, financial worry) risk factors, controlling for demographic factors (gender, age, education, income). RESULTS: About 20.4% of the sample reported depressive symptoms at least 3 days per week. The odds of experiencing depressive symptoms 3+ days in the past week were higher among women (AOR = 1.67, p = 0.002) and younger adults (18-29 years AOR = 2.62, p < 0.001). After adjusting for demographic variables, the odds of experiencing depressive symptoms were higher in households with 4+ persons (AOR = 1.88, p = 0.01), in households with children aged 6 to 12 years (AOR = 1.98, p = 0.02), among those with a job at high risk for exposure to COVID-19 (AOR = 1.82, p = 0.01), and those experiencing financial worry due to COVID-19 ('very worried' AOR = 8.00, p < 0.001).

This means more than 253 million people globally will be at higher risk of affecting by the COVID-19. The current pandemic, followed by a nationwide emergency lockdown to slow the unprecedented spread of the virus, will have a serious impact on people living with visual disabilities and even endangers their lives in the long run. Many restrictive and control measures, including the adoption of new behavioural changes (for example, social distance during outdoor movement, limiting touch or tactile contact) recommended by the government will pose immense challenges to individuals with a visual loss. This serious impact, including challenges in healthcare access, can be minimized through inclusive service approaches, involving persons with visual disabilities, caregivers, family members, and healthcare providers, along with the community to a large extent, and finally, support to improve the overall outcomes. The government, along with profit or non-profit private sectors, should consider initiating such inclusive approaches while planning responses to the pandemic. Indeed, the present COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity for health care planners and decision-makers of various organizations across India for a reformation of disabilities care. Impacts due to the pandemic and lockdown can be reduced substantially if planning and policy are in place before any emergency happened in the future.","Senjam, Suraj S",Indian J Ophthalmol,,585
334724,"Much on early intervention, some thoughts on COVID-19 and a paradox to ponder on",2020,"BACKGROUND: The effective implementation of government policies and measures for controlling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires compliance from the public. This study aimed to examine cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of trust in government regarding COVID-19 control with the adoption of recommended health behaviours and prosocial behaviours, and potential determinants of trust in government during the pandemic. METHODS: This study analysed data from the PsyCorona Survey, an international project on COVID-19 that included 23 733 participants from 23 countries (representative in age and gender distributions by country) at baseline survey and 7785 participants who also completed follow-up surveys. Specification curve analysis was used to examine concurrent associations between trust in government and self-reported behaviours. We further used structural equation model to explore potential determinants of trust in government. Multilevel linear regressions were used to examine associations between baseline trust and longitudinal behavioural changes. RESULTS: Higher trust in government regarding COVID-19 control was significantly associated with higher adoption of health behaviours (handwashing, avoiding crowded space, self-quarantine) and prosocial behaviours in specification curve analyses (median standardised ß = 0.173 and 0.229, p < 0.001). Government perceived as well organised, disseminating clear messages and knowledge on COVID-19, and perceived fairness were positively associated with trust in government (standardised ß = 0.358, 0.230, 0.056, and 0.249, p < 0.01). Higher trust at baseline survey was significantly associated with lower rate of decline in health behaviours over time (p for interaction = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results highlighted the importance of trust in government in the control of COVID-19.","Han, Qing; Zheng, Bang; Cristea, Mioara; Agostini, Maximilian; Bélanger, Jocelyn J; Gützkow, Ben; Kreienkamp, Jannis; Leander, N Pontus",Psychol Med,,585

335147,"The effects of COVID-19 on training within urology: Lessons learned in virtual learning, human factors, non-technical skills and reflective practice",2020,"Introduction: COVID-19 is a novel and devastating disease. Its manifestations vary from asymptomatic to lethal. Moreover, mortality rates differ based on underlying health conditions and ethnicity. We investigated the biochemical rationale behind these observations using machine reasoning by the sci.AI system (https://sci.ai/). Facts were extracted and linked from publications available in nlm.nih.gov and Europe PMC to form the dataset which was validated by medical experts. Results: Based on the analysis of experimental and clinical data, we synthesized detailed biochemical pathways of COVID-19 pathogenesis which were used to explain epidemiological and clinical observations. Clinical manifestations and biomarkers are highlighted to monitor the course of COVID-19 and navigate treatment. As depicted in the Graphical Abstract, SARS-CoV-2 triggers a pro-oxidant (PO) response leading to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a normal innate defense. However, SARS-CoV-2's unique interference with the antioxidant (AO) system, through suppression of nitric oxide (NO) production in the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), leads to an excessive inflammatory PO response. The excessive PO response becomes critical in cohorts with a compromised AO system such as patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd) where NO and glutathione (GSH) mechanisms are impaired. G6PDd develops in patients with metabolic syndrome. It is mediated by aldosterone (Ald) which also increases specifically in COVID-19. Conclusion: G6PD is essential for an adequate immune response. Both G6PDd and SARS-CoV-2 compromise the AO system through the same pathways rendering G6PDd the Achilles' heel for COVID-19. Thus, the evolutionary antimalarial advantage of the G6PDd cohort can be a disadvantage against SARS-CoV-2.","Buinitskaya, Yuliya; Gurinovich, Roman; Wlodaver, Clifford G; Kastsiuchenka, Siarhei",Front Med (Lausanne),,585

Panel data of 20 countries are used spanning January 2 to July 21, 2020, for the dynamic panel model. The results indicate that the overall government response, containment and health, and stringency indices have a significantly positive effect on stock market returns. Specifically, government policy responses of shutting down workplaces, canceling public events, restricting public gatherings and international travel, providing income support, and implementing fiscal measures can increase stock market returns. Our evidence shows that the stock market does not react significantly to government interventions in the health system.

Increased access to specialist care in a regional setting is an additional benefit. Variation in diagnostic accuracy of telehealth consultations may affect diagnosis and management. Therefore, our aim is to determine the diagnostic concordance of telemedicine for otolaryngology in an Australian regional setting with physical consultations. METHODS: Retrospective review was conducted for all patients who received an initial telemedicine appointment over a 7-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic in regional Victoria, Australia. Data were collected regarding initial diagnosis and management from telemedicine consultations, subsequent physical appointment findings and management and intraoperative findings. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism (version 8.0, GraphPad). RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were included. The most common conditions referred were for consideration of tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy (44.0%). Overall diagnostic concordance of the initial referrer was 63.3% and for telephone appointments, it was 81.9%. Concordance of recommended treatment plans between telephone and physical appointments was 96.9%. CONCLUSION: Although physical appointments are an essential aspect of practice in OHNS, there are significant benefits of phone only telemedicine within the context of a global pandemic which were compounded by a regional setting.

337796,Fundraising campaigns via social media platforms for mitigating the impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious infectious disease, responsible for a global pandemic that began in January 2020. Human/COVID-19 interactions cause different outcomes ranging from minor health consequences to death. Since social interaction is the default mode by which individuals communicate with their surroundings, different modes of contagion can play a role in determining the long-term consequences for mental health and emotional well-being. We examined some basic aspects of human social interaction, emphasizing some particular features of the emotional contagion. Moreover, we analyzed the main report that described brain damage related to the COVID-19 infection. Indeed, the goal of this review is to suggest a possible explanation for the relationships among emotionally impaired people, brain damage, and COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: COVID-19 can cause several significant neurological disorders and the pandemic has been linked to a rise in people reporting mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety. Neurocognitive symptoms associated with COVID-19 include delirium, both acute and chronic attention and memory impairment related to hippocampal and cortical damage, as well as learning deficits in both adults and children. CONCLUSIONS: Although our knowledge on the biology and long-term clinical outcomes of the COVID-19 infection is largely limited, approaching the pandemic based on lessons learnt from previous outbreaks of infectious diseases and the biology of other coronaviruses will provide a suitable pathway for developing public mental health strategies, which could be positively translated into therapeutic approaches, attempting to improve stress coping responses, thus contributing to alleviate the burden driven by the pandemic.","Valenzano, Anna; Scarinci, Alessia; Monda, Vincenzo; Sessa, Francesco; Messina, Antonietta; Monda, Marcellino; Precenzano, Francesco; Mollica, Maria Pina; Carotenuto, Marco; Messina, Giovanni; Cibelli, Giuseppe",Medicina (Kaunas),,585

Study of PML-type JCPyV in vitro has been limited due to difficulty in efficient propagation of the virus in cultured cells. In this study, we carried out long term cultivation of COS-7 cells (designated as COS-IMRb cells) transfected with PML type M1-IMRb, an adapted viral DNA with a rearranged non-coding control region (NCCR). The JCPyV derived from COS-IMRb cells was characterized by analyzing viral replication, amount of virus by hemagglutination (HA), production of viral protein 1 (VP1), and structure of the NCCR. HA assays indicated that a high amount of PML type JCPyV was present in COS-IMRb cells. Immunostaining showed that VP1-positive cells were a small population in COS-IMRb cells that represented a JCPyV carrier cell culture. Sequencing analysis of the NCCR of JCPyV after long-term cultivation showed that the NCCR of M1-IMRb was conserved in COS-IMRb cells without any point mutation. The JCPyV genomic DNA derived from a clone of COS-IMRb-3 cells was detected by Southern blotting as a single band of approximately 5.1 kbp without deletion. These findings support that COS-IMRb-3 cells may offer a useful tool for screening anti-JCPyV drugs.","Nukuzuma, Souichi; Nukuzuma, Chiyoko; Kameoka, Masanori; Sugiura, Shigeki; Nakamichi, Kazuo; Tasaki, Takafumi; Hidaka, Koushi; Takegami, Tsutomu",Jpn J Infect Dis,,585

338482,Impact of COVID-19 on poverty and living standards in Ghana: A micro-perspective,2021,"BACKGROUND: People with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have faced unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research from the first two months of the pandemic suggests that a small proportion of people with OCD experienced worsening in their OCD symptoms since the pandemic began, whereas the rest experienced either no change or an improvement in their symptoms. However, as society-level factors relating to the pandemic have evolved, the effects of the pandemic on people with OCD have likely changed as well, in complex and population-specific ways. Therefore, this study contributes to a growing body of knowledge on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people and demonstrates how differences across studies might emerge when studying specific populations at specific timepoints. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess how members of online OCD support communities felt the COVID-19 pandemic had affected their OCD symptoms, around 3 months after the pandemic began. METHODS: We recruited participants from online OCD support communities for our brief survey. Participants indicated how much they felt their OCD symptoms had changed since the pandemic began and how much they felt that having OCD was making it harder to deal with the pandemic. RESULTS: We collected survey data from June through August 2020 and received a total of 196 responses, some of which were partial responses. Among the nonmissing data, 65.9% (108/164) of the participants were from the United States and 90.5% (152/168) had been subjected to a stay-at-home order. In all, 92.9% (182/196) of the participants said they experienced worsening of their OCD symptoms since the pandemic began, although the extent to which their symptoms worsened differed across dimensions of OCD; notably, symmetry and completeness symptoms were less likely to have worsened than others. Moreover, 95.5% (171/179) of the participants felt that having OCD made it difficult to deal with the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of online OCD support community members found a much higher rate of OCD symptom worsening than did other studies on people with OCD conducted during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Factors such as quarantine length, location, overlapping society-level challenges, and differing measurement and sampling choices may help to explain this difference across studies.","Kaveladze, Benjamin; Chang, Katherine; Siev, Jedidiah; Schueller, Stephen M",JMIR Ment Health,,585

Compared to normal weight individuals, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of severe COVID-19 in overweight and obese individuals was 1.26 (1.07, 1.48) and 1.49 (1.25, 1.79), respectively. For COVID-19 mortality, the ORs were 1.19 (0.88, 161) and 1.82 (1.33, 2.49), respectively. Compared to those with a brisk walking pace, the OR of severe COVID-19 for steady/average and slow walkers was 1.13 (0.98, 1.31) and 1.88 (1.53, 2.31), respectively. For COVID-19 mortality, the ORs were 1.44 (1.10, 1.90) and 1.83 (1.26, 2.65), respectively. Slow walkers had the highest risk regardless of obesity status. For example, compared to normal weight brisk walkers, the OR of severe disease and COVID-19 mortality in normal weight slow walkers was 2.42 (1.53, 3.84) and 3.75 (1.61, 8.70), respectively. Self-reported slow walkers appear to be a high-risk group for severe COVID-19 outcomes independent of obesity.","Yates, Thomas; Razieh, Cameron; Zaccardi, Francesco; Rowlands, Alex V; Seidu, Samuel; Davies, Melanie J; Khunti, Kamlesh",Int J Obes (Lond),,585

340603,Key Considerations: Quarantine in the Context of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Prehospital emergency care of children is challenging. In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, when medical personnel should use personal protective equipment against aerosol-generating procedures, the efficiency of medical procedures may decrease. The study objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of different intravascular access methods applied by nurses wearing biosafety Level-2 suits in simulated paediatric COVID-19 resuscitation. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, crossover, single-blinded simulation trial was performed. Nursing staff attending Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support courses accredited by the American Heart Association participated in the study. A total of 65 nurses were recruited and randomly assigned to different study groups. They received standard training on intravascular access methods employing distinct devices. The participants wore biosafety Level-2 suits and performed vascular access with the following intraosseous devices: NIO-P, EZ-IO, and Jamshidi needle; intravenous (IV) access was used as a reference method. Both the order of participants and the access methods were random. Each participant performed intravascular access with each of the four methods tested. The effectiveness of the first attempt to obtain intravascular access and the following time parameters were analysed: the time between grasping the intravascular device out of the original packing until infusion line connection. The ease of the procedure was measured with a visual analogue scale (1 - easy; 10 - difficult). RESULTS: The first attempt success rate of intravascular access by using NIO-P and EZ-IO equalled 100% and was statistically significantly higher than that with the Jamshidi needle (80.0%; p = 0.02) and with the IV method (69.2%; p = 0.005). The time required to connect the infusion line varied and amounted to 33 ± 4 s for NIO-P compared to 37 ± 6.7 s for EZ-IO (p<0.001), 43 ± 7 s for Jamshidi (p<0.001), and 98.5 ± 10 s for IV access (p<0.001). The procedure was easiest in the case of NIO-P and EZ-IO (2 ± 1 points; p=1.0) compared with Jamshidi (5 ± 3 points; p<0.001) and IV access (7 ± 2 points; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence that nurses wearing biosafety Level-2 suits were able to obtain intraosseous access faster and more effectively as compared with IV access during simulated COVID-19 paediatric resuscitation. The most effective method of intravascular access was the NIO-P intraosseous device. Further clinical trials are necessary to confirm the results.","Drozd, Anna; Smereka, Jacek; Pruc, Michal; Malysz, Marek; Gasecka, Aleksandra; Sonmez, Leyla Ozturk; Cyran, Maciej; Konge, Lars; Szarpak, Lukasz",Am J Emerg Med,,585

This odd-even effect probably is due to steric (entropic) reasons, which are not suppressed by the relatively low polar interaction. Three of the middle homologues display a B' phase, which is bistable and shows linear electro-optical switching with a transition to the chiral antiferroelectric smectic phase at a lower temperature.

342021,Challenges for medical libraries in times of COVID-19: Making clinical decisions that uphold research quality,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has altered approaches to anesthesiology education by shifting educational paradigms. This vision paper discusses pre-COVID-19 educational methodologies and best evidence, adaptations required under COVID-19 and evidence for these modifications and suggests future directions for anesthesiology education.Learning management systems provide structure to online learning. They have been increasingly utilized to improve access to didactic materials asynchronously. Despite some historic reservations, the pandemic has necessitated a rapid uptake across programs. Commercially available systems offer a wide range of peer-reviewed curricular options.The flipped classroom promotes learning foundational knowledge prior to teaching sessions with a focus on application during structured didactics. There is growing evidence that this approach is preferred by learners and may increase knowledge gain. The flipped classroom works well with learning management systems to disseminate focused pre-class work. Care must be taken to keep virtual sessions interactive.Simulation, already used in anesthesiology, has been critical in preparation for the care of COVID-19 patients. Multidisciplinary, in-situ simulations allow for rapid dissemination of new team workflows. Physical distancing and reduced availability of providers have required more sessions. Early pandemic decreases in operating volumes have allowed for this; future planning will have to incorporate smaller groups, sanitizing of equipment, and attention to use of personal protective equipment.Effective technical skills training requires instruction to mastery levels, use of deliberate practice, and high-quality feedback. Reduced sizes of skills training workshops and approaches for feedback that are not in-person will be required.Mock oral and OSCE examinations allow for training and assessment of competencies often not addressed otherwise. They provide formative and summative data and objective measurements of ACGME Milestones. They also allow for preparation for the ABA APPLIED examination. Adaptations to teleconferencing or videoconferencing can allow for continued use.Benefits of teaching in this new era include enhanced availability of asynchronous learning and opportunities to apply universal, expert-driven curricula. Burdens include decreased social interactions and potential need for an increased amount of smaller, live sessions.Acquiring learning management systems and holding more frequent simulation and skills sessions with fewer learners may increase cost. With the increasing dependency on multimedia and technology support for teaching and learning, one important focus of educational research is on the development and evaluation of strategies that reduce extraneous processing and manage essential and generative processing in virtual learning environments. Collaboration to identify and implement best practices has the potential to improve education for all learners.","Martinelli, Susan M; Chen, Fei; Isaak, Robert S; Huffmyer, Julie L; Neves, Sara E; Mitchell, John D",,,585

Several studies, particularly from Europe and the USA, have now confirmed these symptoms as an early key feature of COVID-19. About 70â% of patients seem to experience a reduction of smell and taste in the course of the disease, with most of the studies published to date based on questionnaires and anamnestic data. Validated smell tests have so far only been used in a few studies. A distinction between taste and taste disorders, i.âe. a distinction between retronasal aroma taste and the olfactory system from the dysfunction of taste capsules and the further cranial nerves, was mostly not made in the studies available to date. Some reports associate olfactory disorders with a milder clinical course. At the same time, the olfactory system via the olfactory bulb represents an entry point into the central nervous system, and an olfactory disorder could be a predisposing factor for central neurological symptoms. The clinical significance of smell and taste disorders in COVID-19 patients is currently still unclear. Further open questions concern the exact prevalence and the prognosis, so that overall higher quality studies with validated smell tests and larger numbers of patients are required.","Otte, Martin Sylvester; Klußmann, Jens Peter; Luers, Jan Christoffer",Laryngorhinootologie,,585

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been recommended to treat critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in a few reviews, but the clinical study evidence on its efficacy in COVID-19 patients was lacking. Methods: 325 patients with laboratory-confirmed critical COVID-19 were enrolled from 4 government-designated COVID-19 treatment centres in southern China from December 2019 to March 2020. The primary outcomes were 28- and 60-day mortality, and the secondary outcomes were the total length of in-hospital and the total duration of the disease. Subgroup analysis was carried out according to clinical classification of COVID-19, IVIG dosage and timing. Results: In the enrolled 325 patients, 174 cases used IVIG and 151 cases did not. The 28-day mortality was improved with IVIG after adjusting confounding in overall cohort (P = 0.0014), and the in-hospital and the total duration of disease were longer in the IVIG group (P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that only in patients with critical type, IVIG could significantly reduce the 28-day mortality, decrease the inflammatory response and improve some organ functions (all P < 0.05); the application of IVIG in the early stage (admission &#8804; 7 days) with a high dose (> 15 g per day) exhibited significant reduction in 60-day mortality in the critical-type patients. Conclusion: Early administration of IVIG with high dose improves the prognosis of critical-type patients with COVID-19. This study provides important information on clinical application of IVIG in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including patient selection and administration dosage and timing.","Shao, Ziyun; Feng, Yongwen; Zhong, Li; Xie, Qifeng; Lei, Ming; Liu, Zheying; Wang, Conglin; Ji, Jingjing; Liu, Huiheng; Gu, Zhengtao; Hu, Zhongwei; Su, Lei; Wu, Ming; Liu, Zhifeng",Clin Transl Immunology,,585

344956,Strategy for the practice of digestive and oncological surgery during the Covid-19 epidemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: General population surveys have shown that some groups, particularly young women, experienced increased distress during nationally mandated restrictions to control the spread of COVID-19. However, there has been limited research on such trends among people with pre-existing mental health conditions, leaving mental health services ill equipped to plan for current and future lockdowns. METHODS: Mean weekly scores on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 between 01/01/2020-22/06/2020 (n=9,538 individuals) for all patients of two psychological treatment services (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies) in London, were compared to mean weekly scores from the same time periods in 2017-2019 (n=37,849). The proportion of scores which were above the clinical thresholds for 'caseness' each week were compared, and scores between groups based on gender, age group, and ethnicity, were also compared. RESULTS: Confirmed community transmission in the UK (26/02/2020-03/03/2020) and the announcement of the national 'lockdown' (23/03/2020) were associated with significant increases in anxiety symptom scores. 'Lockdown' was associated with a decrease in depression scores. These changes were not maintained during lockdown. Significant increases in depression and anxiety were observed at week 23, as restrictions were eased. LIMITATIONS: This was an exploratory analysis in two services only. Residual confounding and selection biases cannot be ruled out. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the weekly average symptom scores were short-term; they did not continue throughout 'lockdown' as might have been expected, except among older people. Replication of this study in other settings and investigating the potential benefits of more regular reviews or more intensive treatments for at-risk groups, are warranted.","Saunders, Rob; Buckman, Joshua E J; Leibowitz, Judy; Cape, John; Pilling, Stephen",J Affect Disord,,585

Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), as two novel technologies, have been used in many fields for emergency management of disasters. The objective of this paper was to review VR and AR applications in the emergency management of infectious outbreaks with an emphasis on the COVID-19 outbreak. A search was conducted in MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, IEEE, Cochrane Library, Google engine, Google scholar, and related websites for papers published up to May 2, 2020. The VR technology has been used for preventing or responding to infections by simulating human behaviors, infection transmission, and pathogen structure as a means for improving skills management and safety protection. Telehealth, telecommunication, and drug discovery have been among the other applications of VR during this pandemic. Moreover, AR has also been used in various industries, including healthcare, marketing, universities, and schools. Providing high-resolution audio and video communication, facilitating remote collaboration, and allowing the visualization of invisible concepts are some of the advantages of using this technology. However, VR has been used more frequently than AR in the emergency management of previous infectious diseases with a greater focus on education and training. The potential applications of these technologies for COVID-19 can be categorized into four groups, i.e., 1) entertainment, 2) clinical context, 3) business and industry, and 4) education and training. The results of this study indicate that VR and AR have the potential to be used for emergency management of infectious diseases. Further research into employing these technologies will have a substantial impact on mitigating the destructive effects of infectious diseases. Making use of all the potential applications of these technologies should be considered for the emergency management of the current pandemic and mitigating its negative impacts.","Asadzadeh, Afsoon; Samad-Soltani, Taha",Inform Med Unlocked,,585
346501,Features and Limitations of LitCovid Hub for Quick Access to Literature About COVID-19,2020,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study investigated risk factors and estimated rates of acute insomnia disorder in health care workers at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A Qualtrics survey of more than 2,300 health care providers was conducted in a single academic health system on May 15, 2020 including practicing attending physicians, residents and fellows in training, advanced practice providers, and nurses. Six hundred and sixty-eight responded (29% response rate). The survey employed the Research Diagnostic Criteria for insomnia disorder to diagnose acute insomnia disorder. RESULTS: 573 respondents had no missing data pertaining to sleep, with a mean age of 43.4 + 12.5 years and 72% women. The rate of insomnia disorder before COVID-19 was 44.5%, while after COVID-19 it was 64.0%. 10.2% of persons with insomnia disorder before COVID-19 stated it had resolved during COVID-19, while 43.4% of persons who did not have insomnia disorder before COVID-19 developed acute insomnia disorder during COVID-19 (&#967;2=145.2; df=1; P<0.0001). New cases of acute insomnia disorder were related positively to female gender, advancing age, and less time spent in direct patient care. CONCLUSIONS: Acute insomnia disorder was exceptionally common in this sample of tertiary care health care workers. The effects of gender and age were similar to what has been generally described as risk factors for insomnia. The surprising finding that less time spent in direct patient care was associated with more cases of acute insomnia disorder might be explained by the poorly understood stresses of working from home during COVID-19.","McCall, William V; Mensah-Bonsu, Demetra; Withers, Allison E; Gibson, Robert W",J. clin. sleep med,,585

Design: The charts of 1744 consecutive patients in our SCC located in the United States were retrospectively reviewed during the four weeks before transition (February 14-March 12), four weeks after transition (March 20-April 16), and transition week (March 13-March 19). Patient demographics, vital aspects of a supportive care visit such as assessments (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale-Financial and Spiritual [ESAS-FS], Cut-down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener Screen-Adapted to Include Drugs [CAGE-AID], and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale [MDAS]), interdisciplinary team involvement, and visit type were recorded. Results: In total 763 patients were seen before transition, 168 during the transition week, and 813 after transitioning to virtual care. Patient characteristics, ESAS-FS, CAGE-AID, and nurse assessment did not significantly differ among the three groups. The after-transition group had a small reduction in counseling intervention compared with before (20.2% vs. 26.2%; p = 0.0068). MDAS completion was higher after transition (99.6% vs. 98%; p = 0.007). In-person visits decreased from 100% before to 12.7% after transition (p < 0.0001) and virtual visits increased to 49.3% (video) and 38% (telephone). In-person visits decreased to 49% in the week one, 3% in week two, and <2% in week four after transition (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Our supportive care team transitioned from in-person care to virtual visits within weeks while maintaining a high patient volume, continuity of care, and adherence to social distancing. Our transition can serve as a model for other centers.","Reddy, Akhila; Arthur, Joseph; Dalal, Shalini; Hui, David; Subbiah, Ishwaria; Wu, Jimin; Anderson, Aimee E; Castro, Debra; Joy, Manju; Nweke, Chinelo; Gogineni, Meghana; Maddi, Rama; Rozman de Moraes, Aline; Shelal, Zeena; Bruera, Eduardo",J. palliat. med,,585
347117,Prioritisation and the initiation of HCC surveillance in CHB patients: lessons to learn from the COVID-19 crisis,2020,"COVID-19 is a newly discovered deadly disease with no proven definitive treatment until now. It is now proved that it can affect different body organs which necessitate intensive care management. Ozone (O3) therapy was used before for treating various viral infections like hepatitis B, human immune deficiency virus (HIV), and Ebola viruses. O3 also can manage hypoxia and increase tissue oxygenation, besides its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties which may have an important role in the management of cytokine storm. We used rectal O3 insufflation therapy assuming that it may have a beneficial role in the management of COVID-19 disease. Two sessions of rectal O3 therapy were given to a 60-year-old female patient who was confirmed COVID-19 positive. Before applying O3 therapy, she was hypoxic (sPO2:90%) despite mechanical ventilation with high fraction inspired oxygen (FiO2:90%). After therapy, she was markedly improved and discharged to the inpatient ward and then discharged home on day 10 post-admission. Another 40-year-old male patient who was confirmed COVID-19 positive and was home isolated received one session of O3 therapy. Before therapy, he was hypoxic (sPO2:85% on room air and 95% with O2 face mask 5 L/min). The patient showed gradual improvement over the next 3 days after therapy and becomes oxygen-independent (sPO2 became 94-97% on room air). No adverse effects were noticed in both cases. Rectal O3 insufflation can be used safely as adjuvant management for patients with COVID-19 disease.","Hendawy, Hamdy A; Mosallam, Walid; Abuelnaga, Mohamed E; Sabry, Amr M",SN Compr Clin Med,,585
347188,Global spread of COVID-19 and pandemic potential,2020,"Early December 2019 witnessed an international outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID 19) designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). Since then, a number of therapeutic molecules have been explored to have potential efficacy against the SARS-Cov-2 per se or its sequelae. There are no Food and Drug Administration specific therapies approved so far; however, numerous drugs based on varying levels of evidence, in vitro studies and compassionate drug trials are being established as therapeutic agents, especially drugs approved for previous emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Cov). Numerous active clinical trials for COVID-19 with more than 150 drugs and products are under study. Needless to say, many dermatological drugs are being employed to mitigate this pandemic threat. We aim to review drugs with potential against SARS-Cov-2 widely used in dermatology practice. Additionally, rampant and overzealous use of these drugs as well as introduction of new molecules might lead to emergence of adverse effects associated with these agents. Dermatologists must be on lookout for any cutaneous adverse effects of these drugs.

347739,China's Employment Plight and Relief Measures under the Global Spread of COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Preliminary data on SARS-CoV-2 infection suggest that some immunocompromised hosts experience worse outcomes. We performed a retrospective matched cohort study to characterize outcomes in HIV-positive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Leveraging data collected from electronic medical records for all patients hospitalized at NYU Langone Health with COVID-19 between March 2, 2020, and April 23, 2020, we matched 21 HIV-positive patients with 42 non-HIV patients using a greedy nearest-neighbor algorithm. Admission characteristics, laboratory test results, and hospital outcomes were recorded and compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Although there was a trend toward increased rates of intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in HIV-positive patients, these differences were not statistically significant. Rates for these outcomes in our cohort are similar to those previously published for all patients hospitalized with COVID-19. HIV-positive patients had significantly higher admission and peak C-reactive protein values. Other inflammatory markers did not differ significantly between groups, although HIV-positive patients tended to have higher peak values during their clinical course. Three HIV-positive patients had superimposed bacterial pneumonia with positive sputum cultures, and all 3 patients died during hospitalization. There was no difference in frequency of thrombotic events or myocardial infarction between these groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that HIV coinfection does not significantly impact presentation, hospital course, or outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, when compared with matched non-HIV patients. A larger study is required to determine whether the trends we observed apply to all HIV-positive patients.","Karmen-Tuohy, Savannah; Carlucci, Philip M; Zervou, Fainareti N; Zacharioudakis, Ioannis M; Rebick, Gabriel; Klein, Elizabeth; Reich, Jenna; Jones, Simon; Rahimian, Joseph",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,,585

348008,Dynamic Modeling COVID-19 for Comparing Containment Strategies in a Pandemic Scenario,2020-03-31,"The novel SARS-CoV2 has disrupted health systems and the economy, and public health interventions to slow its spread have been costly. How and when to ease restrictions to movement hinges in part on whether SARS-CoV2 will display seasonality due to variations in temperature, humidity, and hours of sunshine. Here, we address this question by means of a spatio-temporal analysis in Spain of the incidence of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Use of spatial Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) allows us to model the incidence of reported cases of the disease per 100,000 population as an interregional contagion process, in addition to a function of temperature, humidity, and sunshine. In the analysis we also control for GDP per capita, percentage of older adults in the population, population density, and presence of mass transit systems. The results support the hypothesis that incidence of the disease is lower at higher temperatures and higher levels of humidity. Sunshine, in contrast, displays a positive association with incidence of the disease. Our control variables also yield interesting insights. Higher incidence is associated with higher GDP per capita and presence of mass transit systems in the province; in contrast, population density and percentage of older adults display negative associations with incidence of COVID-19.","Paez, Antonio; Lopez, Fernando A; Menezes, Tatiane; Cavalcanti, Renata; Pitta, Maira Galdino da Rocha",,,585

Individuals with diabetes and poor glycemic control have an even worse prognosis. Despite of the need/effectiveness of social distancing measures (i.e.: home confinement, quarantine and/or lockdown) during COVID-19 outbreak, preliminary findings showed an increase in negative behaviors during COVID-19 home confinement (i.e.: ~33.5% reduction in physical activity, ~28.6% (~3.10h) increase in sedentary behavior (i.e.: daily sitting, reclining and lying down time), and more unhealthy food consumption and meal pattern), which may have important clinical implications. For example, we estimated that this reduction in physical activity can increase the cases of type 2 diabetes (from ~7.2% to ~9.6%; ~11.1 million cases per year) and all-cause mortality (from ~9.4% to ~12.5%; ~1.7 million deaths per year) worldwide. Few weeks of reduction in physical activity levels result in deleterious effects on several cardiometabolic (i.e.: glycemic control, body composition, inflammatory cytokines, blood pressure, vascular function ) and functional parameters (i.e.: cardiorespiratory/muscle fitness, balance, agility ). In contrast, physical activity and exercise are important tools for preventing and treating diabetes and others NCDs. Home-based exercise programs are useful, safe and effective for the management of diabetes, and could be widely used during COVID-19 outbreak. In this context, there is an urgent need for recommending physical activity/exercise, during and beyond COVID-19 outbreak, for improving the management of diabetes, as well as to prevent the increase in global burden of COVID-19, diabetes and others NCDs.","Marçal, Isabela Roque; Fernandes, Bianca; Viana, Ariane Aparecida; Ciolac, Emmanuel Gomes",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,585

To prevent aerosol dispersion we used a bag valve mask with an antibacterial-antiviral filter, introducing the flexible bronchoscope orally rather than through the nose. For procedures with increased contagious risk a nasopharyngeal swab was required. From the date of the first case of COVID-19 in our hospital to December 31 2020, we performed 1027 bronchoscopies, in both negative and positive patients.

In this study we aimed to investigate the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown period (March-May 2020) on snacking behavior, fast-food and alcohol consumption. A systematic search in PubMed®, Scopus® and Web of Science® databases was conducted and 32 studies were included. Changes in snacking, in fast-food and ordered food consumption and in alcohol intake were examined. Snacking was found to be increased for a significant portion of the population examined (18.9-45.1%), whereas fast food (15.0-41.3%) and ordered food (33.9%) showed a tendency towards decrease. As per alcohol consumption, an upward trend was observed in a significant part (10.4-51.0%) of the participants examined. The increased snacking and alcohol consumption observed for almost a third of the examined population could be alarming because long-term health problems could arise in cases of repeated lockdowns in the future. The observed downward trend in fast-food consumption and in frequency of ordered food could be an encouraging sign of turning to home-prepared foods, but further research is needed in this field.","Bakaloudi, Dimitra Rafailia; Jeyakumar, Dhanushya T; Jayawardena, Ranil; Chourdakis, Michail",Clin. nutr.

350206,Family–school partnerships in the age of Covid-19: reasons for optimism amidst a global pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: A 2017 meta-analysis of data from 25 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) revealed a protective effect of this intervention. We aimed to examine the link between vitamin D supplementation and prevention of ARIs in an updated meta-analysis. METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for studies listed from database inception to May 1, 2020. Double-blind RCTs of vitamin D3, vitamin D2, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) supplementation for any duration, with a placebo or low-dose vitamin D control, were eligible if they had been approved by a research ethics committee, and if ARI incidence was collected prospectively and prespecified as an efficacy outcome. Studies reporting results of long-term follow-up of primary RCTs were excluded. Aggregated study-level data, stratified by baseline 25(OH)D concentration and age, were obtained from study authors. Using the proportion of participants in each trial who had one or more ARIs, we did a random-effects meta-analysis to obtain pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs to estimate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of having one or more ARIs (primary outcome) compared with placebo. Subgroup analyses were done to estimate whether the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of ARI varied according to baseline 25(OH)D concentration (<25 nmol/L vs 25·0-49·9 nmol/L vs 50·0-74·9 nmol/L vs >75·0 nmol/L), vitamin D dose (daily equivalent of <400 international units [IU] vs 400-1000 IU vs 1001-2000 IU vs >2000 IU), dosing frequency (daily vs weekly vs once per month to once every 3 months), trial duration (&#8804;12 months vs >12 months), age at enrolment (<1·00 years vs 1·00-15·99 years vs 16·00-64·99 years vs &#8805;65·00 years), and presence versus absence of airway disease (ie, asthma only, COPD only, or unrestricted). Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020190633. FINDINGS: We identified 1528 articles, of which 46 RCTs (75 541 participants) were eligible. Data for the primary outcome were obtained for 48 488 (98·1%) of 49 419 participants (aged 0-95 years) in 43 studies. A significantly lower proportion of participants in the vitamin D supplementation group had one or more ARIs (14 332 [61·3%] of 23 364 participants) than in the placebo group (14 217 [62·3%] of 22 802 participants), with an OR of 0·92 (95% CI 0·86-0·99; 37 studies; I2=35·6%, pheterogeneity=0·018). No significant effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of having one or more ARIs was observed for any of the subgroups defined by baseline 25(OH)D concentration. However, protective effects of supplementation were observed in trials in which vitamin D was given in a daily dosing regimen (OR 0·78 [95% CI 0·65-0·94]; 19 studies; I2=53·5%, pheterogeneity=0·003), at daily dose equivalents of 400-1000 IU (0·70 [0·55-0·89]; ten studies; I2=31·2%, pheterogeneity=0·16), for a duration of 12 months or less (0·82 [0·72-0·93]; 29 studies; I2=38·1%, pheterogeneity=0·021), and to participants aged 1·00-15·99 years at enrolment (0·71 [0·57-0·90]; 15 studies; I2=46·0%, pheterogeneity=0·027). No significant interaction between allocation to the vitamin D supplementation group versus the placebo group and dose, dose frequency, study duration, or age was observed. In addition, no significant difference in the proportion of participants who had at least one serious adverse event in the vitamin supplementation group compared with the placebo group was observed (0·97 [0·86-1·07]; 36 studies; I2=0·0%, pheterogeneity=0·99). Risk of bias within individual studies was assessed as being low for all but three trials. INTERPRETATION: Despite evidence of significant heterogeneity across trials, vitamin D supplementation was safe and overall reduced the risk of ARI compared with placebo, although the risk reduction was small. Protection was associated with administration of daily doses of 400-1000 IU for up to 12 months, and age at enrolment of 1·00-15·99 years. The relevance of these findings to COVID-19 is not known and requires further investigation.

Although bioethical guidance is available, published procedures for decision-making processes to resolve the time-sensitive conflicts are rare. Failure to establish decision-making procedures before scarcities arise exposes clinicians to moral distress and potential legal liability, entrenches existing systemic biases, and leaves hospitals without processes to guarantee transparency and consistency in the application of ethical guidelines. Formal institutional processes can reduce the panic, inequity, and irresolution that arise from confronting ethical conflicts under duress.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Academic university hospital. PATIENTS: Ninety-seven patients with delayed benign gynecologic procedures owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. INTERVENTION(S): Surgical prioritization was assessed using 2 novel scoring systems, the Gynecologic Medically-Necessary Time-Sensitive (Gyn-MeNTS) and modified Elective Surgery Acuity Scale (mESAS) systems for all 93 patients included. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The interrater reliability and validity of 2 novel surgical prioritization systems (Gyn-MeNTS and mESAS) were assessed. The Gyn-MeNTS scores were calculated by 3 raters and analyzed as continuous variables, with a lower score indicating more urgency/priority. The mESAS score was calculated by 2 raters and analyzed as a 3-level ordinal variable with a higher score indicating more urgency/priority. All 5 raters were blinded to reduce bias. The Gyn-MeNTS interrater reliability was tested using Spearman r and paired t tests were used to detect systematic differences between raters. Weighted &#954; indicated mESAS reliability. Concurrent validity with mESAS and surgeon self-prioritization (SSP) was examined with Spearman r and logistic regression. Spearman r's for all Gyn-MeNTS rater pairs were above 0.80 (0.84 for 1 vs 2; 0.82 for 1 vs 3; and 0.82 for 2 vs 3, all p <.001) indicating strong agreement. The weighted &#954; for the 2 mESAS raters was 0.57 (95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.73) indicating moderate agreement. When used together, both scores were significantly independently associated with SSP, with strong discrimination (area under the curve, 0.89). CONCLUSION: Interrater reliability is acceptable for both scoring systems, and concurrent validity of each is moderate for predicting SSP, but discrimination improves to a high level when they are used together.","Marfori, Cherie Q; Klebanoff, Jordan S; Wu, Catherine Z; Barnes, Whitney A; Carter-Brooks, Charelle M; Amdur, Richard L",J. minim. invasive gynecol,,585
351061,COVID-19 and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses: Frontline Update,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Regional anesthesia techniques were recently introduced to provide analgesia for breast surgery. These techniques are rarely used as the primary anesthesia due to the complexity of breast innervation, with numerous structures that can potentially be disrupted during breast surgery. CASE REPORT: A female patient in her sixties diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma on her left breast was scheduled for a simple mastectomy. After anesthetic evaluation, identification of high risk perioperative cardiovascular complications, it was proposed to perform the surgery only with regional anesthesia. A combination of pectoral nerve block (Pecs II), pecto-intercostal fascial block (PIFB) and supraclavicular nerve block ultrasound-guided were successfully performed. CONCLUSION: This is the first case reporting a novel approach in a patient with severe cardiopulmonary disease who underwent breast surgery in a COVID-19 era.","Días, R; Mendes, Â B; Lages, N; Machado, H",Rev. esp. anestesiol. reanim,,585

351504,Prognostic Scales of COVID-19 Morbidity and Mortality: Necessary but also Reliable./ Escalas pronósticas de morbimortalidad por COVID-19: necesarias pero también fiables,2021,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19 and the American decoupling policy, the global value chains (GVCs) have been switched to regional GVCs, and, in the worst case, are subject to a potential alteration of reversing the GVCs, ultimately entailing a severe impact on international trade and the global energy market. This paper applies a quantitative approach using a computational general equilibrium (CGE) model to estimate the effects of the reverse GVC factors on the global economy, trade, and energy market. These reverse GVC factors will decrease the global GDP, and such effect will bring a greater influence on both China as well as the United States, which is pursuing decoupling. The increased trade costs due to these factors will reduce the GVC indices, mostly in ASEAN by 0.2~1.15%, followed by Korea, Japan and China. Surprisingly, the GVC index in the United States is expected to be strengthened due to the enhanced GVC with its allies such as Canada and Mexico. In China, the use of oil, gas and petroleum is expected to decrease by around 10%, and similar effects are expected in Korea and the EU. Among the world’s major energy producers, it is estimated that the US will reduce energy exports by 16–62% depending on the energy source, and the Middle East and Russia will significantly reduce their gas exports. The global energy market is shrinking, but in particular, the international gas market is expected to decrease by 27.3~38.6%.","Lim, Byeongho Yoo Jeongho Hong Kyoungseo Cheong Inkyo",Energies,,585

353098,New development: COVID-19 as an accelerator of digital transformation in public service delivery,2020,"BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The reported incidence of AKI, however, varies among studies. We aimed to evaluate the incidence of AKI and its association with mortality and morbidity in children infected with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who required hospital admission. METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study from three tertiary centers, which included children with confirmed COVID-19. All children were evaluated for AKI using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition and staging. RESULTS: Of 89 children included, 19 (21 %) developed AKI (52.6 % stage I). A high renal angina index score was correlated with severity of AKI. Also, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) was increased in children with AKI compared to those with normal kidney function (15 % vs. 1.5 %). Patients with AKI had significantly more pediatric intensive care admissions (PICU) (32 % vs. 2.8 %, p < 0.001) and mortality (42 % vs. 0 %, p < 0.001). However, AKI was not associated with prolonged hospitalization (58 % vs. 40 %, p = 0.163) or development of MIS-C (10.5 % vs. 1.4 %, p = 0.051). No patient in the AKI group required renal replacement therapy. Residual renal impairment at discharge occurred in 9 % of patients. This was significantly influenced by the presence of comorbidities, hypotension, hypoxia, heart failure, acute respiratory distress, hypernatremia, abnormal liver profile, high C-reactive protein, and positive blood culture. CONCLUSIONS: AKI occurred in one-fifth of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospital admission, with one-third of those requiring PICU. AKI was associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and residual renal impairment at time of discharge.","Kari, Jameela Abdulaziz; Shalaby, Mohamed A; Albanna, Amr S; Alahmadi, Turki S; Alherbish, Adi; Alhasan, Khalid A",BMC Nephrol,,585

Bone disease is a very common complication related to the poor absorption of calcium, the secondary chronic renal disease with low vitamin D, as well as multiple endocrine risk factors. The aim of this systematic review was to estimate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in thalassemia, as well as its association with osteoporosis/low bone mass. A systematic review was carried out using PubMed/Medline, Cochrane, and EBSCO databases. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed with the validated Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale adapted for cross-sectional studies and cohort studies respectfully and the Cochrane Collaboration for clinical trials. After application of predetermined exclusion criteria compatible with the PICOS process, a total of 12 suitable articles were identified. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varied considerably. Only five of the reviewed studies examined the correlation between vitamin D levels and BMD of which just three showed a statistically significant positive association of mild/moderate grade. Vitamin D deficiency is a common comorbidity in patients with thalassemia. However, both its prevalence and its severity vary considerably in different populations, and existing evidence is insufficient to conclude whether vitamin D supplementation is also associated with BMD improvement in this special population group.","Manolopoulos, P P; Lavranos, G; Mamais, I; Angouridis, A; Giannakou, K; Johnson, E O",Osteoporosis int,,585

Furthermore, those with uncontrolled diabetes are at a higher risk for complications due to COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to find an innovative method to sustain effective diabetes care services amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Outpatient diabetes care was successfully transformed from traditional face-to-face encounters in the clinic to an online telemedicine service. RESULTS: 1,972 patients were encountered over a 4-week study period during which we had a low proportion of unreached patients (4%). Some patients were still seen in person because they came as walk-in visits or insisted to be seen in person. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine has become an essential healthcare service and could be augmented by the use of technology like web-based applications and communication via transfer of data from patients' glucometer, insulin pumps, or sensors. Diabetes care can be transitioned to telemedicine effectively and would be successful in reaching more patients than by traditional face-to-face visits. This model of care is time consuming and unfortunately does not reduce the need for medical staff.","Alromaihi, Dalal; Alamuddin, Naji; George, Suby",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,585
353430,Covid-19: Deadline for roll out of UK's tracing app will be missed,2020,"BACKGROUND: Variability in the health effects of dietary fiber might arise from inter-individual differences in the gut microbiota's ability to ferment these substrates into beneficial metabolites. Our understanding of what drives this individuality is vastly incomplete and will require an ecological perspective as microbiomes function as complex inter-connected communities. Here, we performed a parallel two-arm, exploratory randomized controlled trial in 31 adults with overweight and class-I obesity to characterize the effects of long-chain, complex arabinoxylan (n = 15) at high supplementation doses (female: 25 g/day; male: 35 g/day) on gut microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acid production as compared to microcrystalline cellulose (n = 16, non-fermentable control), and integrated the findings using an ecological framework. RESULTS: Arabinoxylan resulted in a global shift in fecal bacterial community composition, reduced &#945;-diversity, and the promotion of specific taxa, including operational taxonomic units related to Bifidobacterium longum, Blautia obeum, and Prevotella copri. Arabinoxylan further increased fecal propionate concentrations (p = 0.012, Friedman's test), an effect that showed two distinct groupings of temporal responses in participants. The two groups showed differences in compositional shifts of the microbiota (p &#8804; 0.025, PERMANOVA), and multiple linear regression (MLR) analyses revealed that the propionate response was predictable through shifts and, to a lesser degree, baseline composition of the microbiota. Principal components (PCs) derived from community data were better predictors in MLR models as compared to single taxa, indicating that arabinoxylan fermentation is the result of multi-species interactions within microbiomes. CONCLUSION: This study showed that long-chain arabinoxylan modulates both microbiota composition and the output of health-relevant SCFAs, providing information for a more targeted application of this fiber. Variation in propionate production was linked to both compositional shifts and baseline composition, with PCs derived from shifts of the global microbial community showing the strongest associations. These findings constitute a proof-of-concept for the merit of an ecological framework that considers features of the wider gut microbial community for the prediction of metabolic outcomes of dietary fiber fermentation. This provides a basis to personalize the use of dietary fiber in nutritional application and to stratify human populations by relevant gut microbiota features to account for the inconsistent health effects in human intervention studies.

355735,Environmental samples: a valuable military help for COVID-19 lockdown exit strategy,2020,"Contact tracing is a very powerful method to implement and enforce social distancing to avoid spreading of infectious diseases. The traditional approach of contact tracing is time consuming, manpower intensive, dangerous and prone to error due to fatigue or lack of skill. Due to this there is an emergence of mobile based applications for contact tracing. These applications primarily utilize a combination of GPS based absolute location and Bluetooth based relative location remitted from user's smartphone to infer various insights. These applications have eased the task of contact tracing; however, they also have severe implication on user's privacy, for example, mass surveillance, personal information leakage and additionally revealing the behavioral patterns of the user. This impact on user's privacy leads to trust deficit in these applications, and hence defeats their purpose. In this work we discuss the various scenarios which a contact tracing application should be able to handle. We highlight the privacy handling of some of the prominent contact tracing applications. Additionally, we describe the various threat actors who can disrupt its working, or misuse end user's data, or hamper its mass adoption. Finally, we present privacy guidelines for contact tracing applications from different stakeholder's perspective. To best of our knowledge, this is the first generic work which provides privacy guidelines for contact tracing applications.","Shukla, Manish; RajanM, A; Lodha, Sachin; Shroff, Gautam; Raskar, Ramesh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13328v1.pdf,585

The disease burden and predictors of mortality in this population remain uncertain. Methods: Prospective observational cohort study from 139 intensive care units of the international COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium. Patients enrolled from January 14th through November 31st 2020 were included in the analysis. Patient's characteristics and clinical data were assessed. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis was conducted to identify indipendent predictors of mortality within 28 days from commencement of MV. Results: 1578 patients on MV were included into the analysis. Mean±SD age was 59 years±13 and patients were predominantly males (66%). 542 Patients (34.4%) died within 28 days from commencement of MV. Nonsurvivors were slightly older (mean age±SD 62±13 vs. 59±13) and presented more frequently hypertension, chronic cardiac disease and diabetes. Median (IQR) PaO2/FiO2 upon commencement of MV was 96 (68-135) and 111 (81-173) in patients who did not survive vs. survivors, respectively (p=0.04). ECMO (13% vs 25%, p&lt;0.01), inhaled nitric oxide (11% vs 15%, p=0.02) and recruitment manoeauvres (26% vs 31%, p&lt;0.01) were used less frequently in patients who did not survive. Independent risk factors associated with 28-day mortality included age older than 70 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.83;95% CI, 1.32-6.07), higher creatinine levels upon ICU admission (HR, 1.20;95% CI, 1.03-1.40), and lower pH within 24h from commencement of MV (HR, 0.12;95% CI, 0.02-0.62), while a shorter period (day) from early symptoms to hospitalisation reduced mortality risks (HR, 0.96;95% CI, 0.93-0.99). Conclusions: Our findings from a large international cohort of critically-ill COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation emphasises that elderly patients, not promptly admitted to the hospital, and who present higher creatinine levels and acidosis are at higher risk of mortality.","Li Bassi, G.; Suen, J.; Dalton, H.

In this study, we focus on factors that differentiate those who are undecided from those who are either willing or unwilling to accept a prospective COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: An online survey in May 2020 assessed Australian adults' willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (yes, maybe, no). A multinomial logistical regression of responses (N = 1,313) was used to identify correlates of vaccine willingness between the three groups. RESULTS: 65% were willing to vaccinate, with 27% being in the 'maybe' category. Respondents were more likely to be in the 'maybe' than the 'yes' group when they perceived COVID-19 to be less severe, had less trust in science, were less willing to vaccinate for influenza, and were female. They were more likely to be in the 'maybe' than 'no' group when they perceived COVID-19 as severe, and less likely to be a hoax, had more trust in science, and greater willingness to vaccinate for influenza. A repeat of the survey in November 2020 with a subset of participants found fewer of them saying yes to the vaccine (56%) and more saying maybe (31%). CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of any COVID-19 vaccine rollout will be reliant on maximizing uptake. The significant number of people who remain undecided about whether or not to get a COVID-19 vaccine, despite the ongoing devastating consequences of the virus for individuals, communities, and economies, is concerning. Our findings aid current research seeking to inform policy regarding how to convince the undecided to vaccinate.","Attwell, Katie; Lake, Joshua; Sneddon, Joanne; Gerrans, Paul; Blyth, Chris; Lee, Julie",PLoS One,,585

We compared 32 patients who underwent UD HSCT using cryopreserved peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) during the COVID-19 pandemic with 32 patients who underwent UD HSCT using fresh PBSC in the previous period. Median neutrophil engraftment was 17.5 and 17.0 days with cryopreserved and fresh grafts, respectively. Non-significant delays were found in platelet recovery days (25.5 versus 19.0; P = 0.192) and full donor chimerism days (35.0 and 31.5; P = 0.872) using cryopreserved PBSC. The rate of acute graft-versus-host disease at 100 days was 41% (95% CI [21-55%]) in cryopreserved group versus 31% (95% CI [13-46%]) in fresh group (P = 0.380). One-hundred days progression-relapse free survival and overall survival did not differ significantly. During COVID-19 pandemic, six frozen UD donations were not transfused and logistical and clinical issues regarding cryopreservation procedure, packaging, and transporting appeared. In summary, UD HSCT with cryopreserved PBSC was safe during this challenging time. More efforts are needed to ensure that all frozen grafts are transplanted and cryopreservation requirements are harmonized.","Fernandez-Sojo, Jesus; Azqueta, Carmen; Valdivia, Elena; Martorell, Lluis; Medina-Boronat, Laura; Martínez-Llonch, Nuria; Torrents, Silvia; Codinach, Margarita; Canals, Carme; Elorza, Izaskun; Parody, Rocio; Martino, Rodrigo; Trabazo, Maria; Díaz de Heredia, Cristina; Ferra, Christelle; Valcárcel, David; Linares, Mónica; Ancochea, Águeda; García-Rey, Enric; García-Muñoz, Nadia; Medina, Laura; Castillo, Nerea; Carreras, Enric; Villa, Juliana; Querol, Sergio",Bone marrow transplant,,585
356609,Improving IMF’s Reputation in the Context of COVID-19,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic forced instructors to move their courses to online modalities and many continue to struggle to deliver course content in effective ways. The purpose of this intervention was to use Zoom to effectively manage two separate class debates in an Ethical Issues in Biology course. This course is a requirement for the BS in Biotechnology and is usually offered in a hybrid accelerated mode. In the fall of 2020, it was switched to Zoom remote modality which replaced the Face-to-Face (F2F) portion of this accelerated course. By design, the course is limited to 12 students and they were divided into two debate teams. In the F2F mode each team would align their chairs to face each other during the debate. Currently Zoom does not have the capability to mimic this team alignment. To increase student engagement and differentiate between the two teams, each team chose a team color, a team name and a mascot. With these decisions made the Black Panthers chose to wear black shirts while the Platypi wore white shirts. The first debate topic was organ transplants and the Black Panthers defended the position that the organ should go to the first match at the top of the list with no exceptions. The Platypi defended the position that there should be exceptions made to allow a patient to receive an organ when they are not at the top of the list. The Black Panthers won the coin toss and each member presented evidence to support their position then the Platypi followed suit. After each team had presented their position time was allotted for rebuttal. To prevent students from talking over each other the instructor moderated this portion of the debate by calling on the students who raised their hands. Two weeks later the second debate on genetic privacy was held with a volley format. The Black Panthers defended the position that individuals own their own DNA and do not have to provide it for any reason. The Platypi defended the position that the law of the land supersedes individual rights and compliance is mandatory. In the volley format one member of the Platypi stated their position followed by a Black Panther and continued in this alternating volley format until all team members had stated their positions and a rebuttal followed. While both methods of debate were effective in engaging the class, the students preferred the volley style. Having the students wear team colors was very effective in being able to differentiate the team members. One additional benefit to using Zoom for this activity is that the instructor could see the students? names to call on them in an efficient manner. Using team names, team colors and the volley format the class debates successfully engaged the students and were delivered in an effective manner via Zoom.","Halpin, Patricia",The FASEB Journal,,585
357384,Precisión del pronóstico de la propagación del COVID-19 en Colombia,2020,"The aim of this article was to study the impact of the COVID19 lockdown on anxiety and depressive symptoms on the basis of responses to an online survey from 1753 French-speaking subjects, conducted between April 27 and May 11, 2020. METHOD: Using a biopsychosocial model, the effects of socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender at birth, socio-professional category, sexual orientation), lockdown conditions (material factors: urban density of the place of residence, surface area of the place of residence during lockdown), social characteristics: living with a partner during lockdown, presence of children during lockdown) and psychosocial history (attachment styles) on anxiety - evaluated on the GAD7 - and depression - evaluated on the MDI - were investigated. Ordinal regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The rates of depression observed (moderate or severe depression: 22.5%) and anxiety (moderate or severe anxiety: 18.4%) were higher than usual but lower than what has been documented in other studies on the effects of lockdown. Women appeared to be more vulnerable than men (Anxiety: AOR=1.647, CI 95%=1.647-2.530; Depression: AOR=1.622, CI 95%=1.274-2.072). Bisexual individuals had an increased likelihood of anxiety symptoms (AOR=1.962, CI 95%=1.544-2.490) and depression (AOR=1.799, CI 95%=1.394-2.317). For homosexuals, only links with depression were observed (AOR=1.757, CI 95%=1.039-2.906). People in a situation of economic vulnerability were more prone to anxiety disorders (e.g. people with no working activity: AOR=1.791, CI 95%=1.147-2.790) or depression (e.g. people with no working activity: AOR=2.581, CI 95%=1.633-4.057). Links with attachment styles were also found. Fearful subjects were particularly vulnerable (anxiety: AOR=2.514, CI 95%=1.985-3.190; depression: AOR=2.521, CI 95%=1.938-3.289), followed by subjects with an anxious attachment style (anxiety: AOR=1.949, CI 95%=1.498-2.540; depression: AOR=1.623, CI 95%=1.207-2.181). The impact of lockdown on avoidant subjects only concerned depression (AOR=1.417, CI 95%=1.034-1.937). Being with a partner during lockdown appeared to have a protective effect against depression (AOR=.693, CI 95%=.555-.866). Neither the presence of children, the surface area of the lockdown residence, nor the population density of the place of residence was associated with anxiety or depression. CONCLUSION: The impact of lockdown on mental health depends on a range of dimensions that need to be apprehended in order to tailor post-lockdown psychological and social support. Management based on a biopsychosocial approach should be favored.","Gouvernet, B; Bonierbale, M",Encephale,,585

During this pandemic, clinical teaching hospitals have faced unprecedented challenges regarding the management of postgraduate medical students since postgraduate students in clinical medicine have both student and resident identity characteristics. The purpose of this study was to explore the management effectiveness of Peking University Third Hospital (PUTH) based on PDCA (plan-do-check-act) cycle management and to further develop the medical student management system during the pandemic. METHODS: The methods of document review, questionnaire surveys and interviews were used to continuously improve the management measures for postgraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic by using the PDCA cycle. RESULTS: Investigations were conducted on the management system, back-to-school arrangements, laboratory management, COVID-19 prevention and control training, online teaching, mentoring, dissertation progress, and emotional state of postgraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that strengthening public health management knowledge training, increasing infectious-disease-related knowledge training, innovating online teaching methods, improving PDCA management model maps, and formulating improvement programmes are conducive to improving the quality of such management. CONCLUSION: Given the difficulties involved in the management of postgraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic, managers need to comprehensively consider and conduct overall planning and use the PDCA management model to improve the management of postgraduate medical students during this period.","Gu, Shixian; Zhang, Aijing; Huo, Gang; Yuan, Wenqing; Li, Yan; Han, Jiangli; Shen, Ning",BMC Med Educ,,585

357857,In Search of Revival from the Pandemic: Relevance of the Gandhian Perspective with Special Reference to India (preprint),2021,"The novel pandemic called ""Coronavirus Disease 2019"" (COVID-19), as a global public health emergency and global threat, has affected many countries in unpredictable ways and impacted on physical activity (PA) behaviors to various extents. Specific populations including refugees, asylum seekers, and prisoners, are vulnerable groups with multiple complex health needs and worse health outcomes with respect to the general population worldwide and at high risk of death from the ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus type 2"" (SARS-CoV-2). Governments around the world have been implementing preventive healthcare policies, including physical and social distancing, isolation, and confinement, to mitigate against the burden imposed by the COVID-19 outbreak. This pandemic period is characterized by reduced or lack of movement. During this period of lockdown, PA can represent an immunotherapy and a preventative approach to avoid the harmful effects of inactivity due to the pandemic. Moreover, PA could be prescribed to improve the immune system of specific populations (refugees, asylum seekers, and prisoners), which particularly experience the condition of being confined. The present narrative review discusses the potential impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on these specific populations' health status and the importance of performing PA/exercise to reduce the deleterious effects of COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we aim to provide useful recommendations on PA/exercise for these specific populations to maintain their level of independence, physical, and mental health as well as their wellbeing.","Ghram, A.; Bragazzi, N.

Efforts are being made to reduce disease screening times and in the development of a vaccine to resist this disease, even as thousands succumb to it everyday. We propose a novel method of automated screening of diseases like Covid-19 and pneumonia from Chest X-Ray images with the help of Computer Vision. Unlike computer vision classification algorithms which come with heavy computational costs, we propose a knowledge distillation based approach which allows us to bring down the model depth, while preserving the accuracy. We make use of an augmentation of the standard distillation module with an auxiliary intermediate assistant network that aids in the continuity of the flow of information. Following this approach, we are able to build an extremely light student network, consisting of just 3 convolutional blocks without any compromise on accuracy. We thus propose a method of classification of diseases which can not only lead to faster screening, but can also operate seamlessly on low-end devices.","Bandyopadhyay, Hmrishav; Dastidar, Shuvayan Ghosh; Mondal, Bisakh; Banerjee, Biplab; Das, Nibaran",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03470v1.pdf,585

The 'alliedness' of this health care professional group is an evolving entity that can no longer be overlooked. The central and indispensable role played by radiologic technologists (RTs) invites meaningful discussion and debate among peers and researchers, to better describe the professional identity and role of the RT as an indispensable member of the interprofessional team.

359160,Editorial: Covid-19 Studies in the Field of Infrastructure Planning and Management,2021,"BACKGROUND: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks can be provoked with psychological factors. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of anxiety, depression and stress related to COVID-19 pandemic on disease activity of HAE patients during the quarantine period (QP) and the return to normal period (RTNP). METHODS: This study was conducted between March 2020 and September 2020 in four allergy centres. Demographic, clinical features and mental health status were evaluated in QP (from March to the beginning of June) and RTNP (from June to the beginning of September) applied by the government. The 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS10) was used to define the severity of HAE attacks. Depression-Anxiety- Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and Fear of COVID-19 (FC-19) scales were performed to assess mental health status. RESULTS: 139 HAE patients were included in the study. In QP, median attack numbers and median VAS10 scores were 5 (min-max: 0-45) and 6 (min-max: 0-10), respectively. HAE attack numbers, DASS-21 stress, anxiety, depression and total DASS-21 scores, as well as FC-19 scores were higher in QP than RTNP (p=0.001, p<0.001, p=0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively). However, there was no difference in attack severity scores between the two periods (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that the restriction measures during COVID-19 outbreak causes an increase in the number of HAE attacks in relation to anxiety, depression, stress and fear of COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is important to provide psychological support to HAE patients during the pandemic.","Eyice Karabacak, Deniz; Demir, Semra; Yegit, Osman Ozan; Can, Ali; Terzioglu, Kadriye; Erdogdu Ünal, Derya; Olgaç, Müge; Coskun, Raif; Çolakoglu, Bahauddin; Büyüköztürk, Suna; Gelincik, Asli",Allergy,,585
359183,Geopolitics of Covid-19: global challenge at national borders,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused over 1.4 million deaths worldwide. Repurposing existing drugs offers the fastest opportunity to identify new indications for existing drugs as a stable solution against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is a critical target for designing potent antiviral agents against COVID-19. In this study, we identify potential inhibitors against COVID-19, using an amalgam of virtual screening, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and binding-free energy approaches from the Korea Chemical Bank drug repurposing (KCB-DR) database. The database screening of KCB-DR resulted in 149 binders. The dynamics of protein-drug complex formation for the seven top scoring drugs were investigated through MD simulations. Six drugs showed stable binding with active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro indicated by steady RMSD of protein backbone atoms and potential energy profiles. Furthermore, binding free energy calculations suggested the community-acquired bacterial pneumonia drug ceftaroline fosamil and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor telaprevir are potent inhibitors against Mpro. Molecular dynamics and interaction analysis revealed that ceftaroline fosamil and telaprevir form hydrogen bonds with important active site residues such as Thr24, Thr25, His41, Thr45, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, and Glu166 that is supported by crystallographic information of known inhibitors. Telaprevir has potential side effects, but its derivatives have good pharmacokinetic properties and are suggested to bind Mpro. We suggest the telaprevir derivatives and ceftaroline fosamil bind tightly with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and should be validated through preclinical testing.","Kumar, Raj; Kumar, Vikas; Lee, Keun Woo",Comput Biol Med,,585

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 14 children with developmental delay, who had already tried a personalised music therapy (Euterpe method). We included them in a 12-day programme of home-based music therapy. The children and their parents were investigated using the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children and the Parent Stress Index-Short Form. RESULTS: Fourteen children started the intervention, while only 12 children completed all the planned home sessions and assessments. We observed a significant improvement in children's sleep quality and a reduction of parental distress. DISCUSSION: The significant improvements in parental distress and sleep quality must be considered important achievements for the quality of life of a child and their family. Home-based music therapy can provide a feasible approach to improving sleep and parent's stress for children with developmental disorders.","Bompard, Sarah; Liuzzi, Tommaso; Staccioli, Susanna; D039,; Arienzo, Fiammetta; Khosravi, Sahereh; Giuliani, Roberto; Castelli, Enrico",J Telemed Telecare,,585

PURPOSE: To summarize chest computed tomography (CT) manifestations of the early stage of COVID-19 infection and provide a piece of reliable imaging evidence for initial screening and diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 10 January 2020 to 10 February 2020, we continuously observed chest CT imaging of 14 patients with clinically suspected new coronavirus infection in the two weeks after onset of symptoms. Ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, reticular pattern, and ground-glass mimic nodules in each patient's chest CT image were recorded. RESULTS: We enrolled 14 patients, of which nine patients had the infection confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Five patients were highly suspected of infection. All cases had epidemiological evidence. GGO was a dominant imaging manifestation in the initial days of infection. GGO performance accounts for 40% in 1- 2 days, 90% in 3- 6 days, and 85% in 7- 10 days. With disease progression, consolidation appeared on follow-up CT. Consolidation performance accounts for 0% in 1- 2 days, 40% in 3- 6 days, and 71% in 7- 10 days. The lesions are mostly near the pleura. The number of lesions and the extent of the lesions increased as the disease progressed. CONCLUSION: Patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia have characteristic CT features in the initial stage of infection, which can be used as an essential supplement for nucleic acid examination.","Hu, Shan; Li, Zhen; Chen, Xu; Liang, Chang-Hong",Acta Radiol,,585

The characteristics of this virus, as well as its short- and long-term implications, are not yet well understood. The objective of the current paper was to provide a critical review of the emerging literature on COVID-19 and its implications for neurological, neuropsychiatric, and cognitive functioning. METHOD: A critical review of recently published empirical research, case studies, and reviews pertaining to central nervous system (CNS) complications of COVID-19 was conducted by searching PubMed, PubMed Central, Google Scholar, and bioRxiv. RESULTS: After considering the available literature, areas thought to be most pertinent to clinical and research neuropsychologists, including CNS manifestations, neurologic symptoms/syndromes, neuroimaging, and potential long-term implications of COVID-19 infection, were reviewed. CONCLUSION: Once thought to be merely a respiratory virus, the scientific and medical communities have realized COVID-19 to have broader effects on renal, vascular, and neurological body systems. The question of cognitive deficits is not yet well studied, but neuropsychologists will undoubtedly play an important role in the years to come.","Hewitt, Kelsey C; Marra, David E; Block, Cady; Cysique, Lucette A; Drane, Daniel L; Haddad, Michelle M; Lojek, Emilia; McDonald, Carrie R; Reyes, Anny; Eversole, Kara; Bowers, Dawn",J Int Neuropsychol Soc,,585

361986,Academic Leadership in the Time of COVID-19-Experiences and Perspectives,2021,"How has the informality of urban slums exposed a gap in policy formulation and research questions in the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic? This paper seeks to identify the appropriate questions and policy frame that would assist future researchers and policymakers on the subject of pandemics in densely populated urban settlements. The authors argue that the nexus between asking the appropriate questions and developing appropriate policy response measures during a pandemic can significantly impact the outcome of the response. The paper examines how the government of Kenya's response to the COVID-19 pandemic reveals a deep-rooted socio-economic and cultural inequality when ""blanket"" policies are adopted without taking into consideration the unique dynamics characterizing the society. The findings show that the effectiveness of implementing COVID-19 containment policies such as lockdowns, the cession of movement, working from home, distance learning, and social distancing are affected by other factors such as the nature of jobs, one's income levels, where someone lives, cultural beliefs, access to water, sanitation, internet, and medical facilities. This means that a significant number of people within the society experience a double tragedy from the pandemic and impact of government response measures. Yet most of the existing literature has focused on the causes, spread, and impact of the pandemic on health institutions, economies, and public health with little emphasis on the impact on policy measures especially on the vulnerable segments of the society. This paper, therefore, looks at the question of how the various public health intervention strategies disrupt or construct the livelihood of the already complex informal settlement. It provides policymakers and researchers with a number of questions that can frame policy and research during a pandemic with important consideration to urban informality.","Nyadera, Israel Nyaburi; Onditi, Francis; Obimbo, Moses Madadi; Muchina, Samson Kinyanjui",,,585

In the United States, the country with the highest confirmed COVID-19 infection cases, a nationwide social distancing protocol has been implemented by the President. For the first time in a hundred years since the 1918 flu pandemic, the US population is mandated to stay in their households and avoid public contact. As a result, the majority of public venues and services have ceased their operations. Following the closure of the University of Washington on March 7th, more than a thousand colleges and universities in the United States have cancelled in-person classes and campus activities, impacting millions of students. This paper aims to discover the social implications of this unprecedented disruption in our interactive society regarding both the general public and higher education populations by mining people's opinions on social media. We discover several topics embedded in a large number of COVID-19 tweets that represent the most central issues related to the pandemic, which are of great concerns for both college students and the general public. Moreover, we find significant differences between these two groups of Twitter users with respect to the sentiments they expressed towards the COVID-19 issues. To our best knowledge, this is the first social media-based study which focuses on the college student community's demographics and responses to prevalent social issues during a major crisis.","Duong, Viet; Pham, Phu; Yang, Tongyu; Wang, Yu; Luo, Jiebo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09968v1.pdf,585

In addition to molecular testing for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical laboratories have also needed to increase testing capacity to include serological evaluation of patients with suspected or known COVID-19. While regulatory approved serological immunoassays are now widely available from diagnostic manufacturers globally, there is significant debate regarding the clinical utility of these tests, as well as their clinical and analytical performance requirements prior to application. This document by the International Federation for Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) Taskforce on COVID-19 provides interim guidance on: (A) clinical indications and target populations, (B) assay selection, (C) assay evaluation, and (D) test interpretation and limitations for serological testing of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection. These evidence-based recommendations will provide practical guidance to clinical laboratories in the selection, verification, and implementation of serological assays and are of the utmost importance as we expand our pandemic response from initial case tracing and containment to mitigation strategies to minimize resurgence and further morbidity and mortality.","Bohn, Mary Kathryn; Loh, Tze Ping; Wang, Cheng-Bin; Mueller, Robert; Koch, David; Sethi, Sunil; Rawlinson, William D; Clementi, Massimo; Erasmus, Rajiv; Leportier, Marc; Grimmler, Matthias; Yuen, K Y; Mancini, Nicasio; Kwon, Gye Cheol; Menezes, María Elizabeth; Patru, Maria-Magdalena; Gramegna, Maurizio; Singh, Krishna; Najjar, Osama; Ferrari, Maurizio; Horvath, Andrea R; Lippi, Giuseppe; Adeli, Khosrow",Clin Chem Lab Med,,585

Its effect and impact are still evolving, with deaths estimated to reach 40 million if unchecked. One effective and complementary strategy to slow the spread and reduce the impact is to trace the primary and secondary contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases using contact tracing technology. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to survey strategies for digital contact tracing for the COVID-19 pandemic and to present how using mobile positioning data conforms with Nigeria's data privacy regulations. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory review of current measures for COVID-19 contact tracing implemented around the world. We then analyzed how countries are using mobile positioning data technology to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We made recommendations on how Nigeria can adopt this approach while adhering to the guidelines provided by the National Data Protection Regulation (NDPR). RESULTS: Despite the potential of digital contact tracing, it always conflicts with patient data privacy regulations. We found that Nigeria's response complies with the NDPR, and that it is possible to leverage call detail records to complement current strategies within the NDPR. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that mobile position data contact tracing is important for epidemic control as long as it conforms to relevant data privacy regulations. Implementation guidelines will limit data misuse.","Ekong, Iniobong; Chukwu, Emeka; Chukwu, Martha",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,585

METHOD: We selected two relevant processing steps, denoise and segmentation, implemented by two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) models based on autoencoder architecture (encoder-decoder and UNet) and trained for the two tasks. In order to limit the number of uncontrolled variables, we designed a phantom containing cylindrical inserts of different sizes, filled with iodinated contrast media. A large CT image dataset was collected at different acquisition settings and two reconstruction algorithms. We characterized the CNNs behavior using metrics from the signal detection theory, radiological and conventional image quality parameters, and finally unconventional radiomic features analysis. RESULTS: The UNet, due to the deeper architecture complexity, outperformed the shallower encoder-decoder in terms of conventional quality parameters and preserved spatial resolution. We also studied how the CNNs modify the noise texture by using radiomic analysis, identifying sensitive and insensitive features to the denoise processing. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed evaluation approach proved effective to accurately analyze and quantify the differences in CNNs behavior, in particular with regard to the alterations introduced in the processed images. Our results suggest that even a deeper and more complex network, which achieves good performances, is not necessarily a better network because it can modify texture features in an unwanted way.","Doria, Sandra; Valeri, Federico; Lasagni, Lorenzo; Sanguineti, Valentina; Ragonesi, Ruggero; Akbar, Muhammad Usman; Gnerucci, Alessio; Del Bue, Alessio; Marconi, Alessandro; Risaliti, Guido; Grigioni, Mauro; Miele, Vittorio; Sona, Diego; Cisbani, Evaristo; Gori, Cesare; Taddeucci, Adriana",Phys Med,,585
364213,Implications of the Covid-19 Pandemic: Canvassing Opinion from Planning Professionals,2021,"BACKGROUND: There appears to be large regional variation for susceptibility, severity, and mortality for COVID-19 infections. Numerous potential factors could explain the wide variability in the number of infections and death among the countries. We examined genetic differences in the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) gene, as its receptor serves as a cellular entry for SARS-CoV-2. At present, there is a paucity of data regarding the differences for ACE2 polymorphisms and expression levels between ethnicities. METHODS: We compared the allele frequency of mutations between European and East Asians. Molecular dynamic simulation were performed to investigate the influences of significant mutant on protein structure. The binding free energies were calculated between S protein and hACE2. We also examined hACE2 gene expression in eight global populations from HapMap3. RESULTS: Four missense mutations showed significant minor allele frequency difference between Asians and Caucasians. Molecular dynamic demonstrated that two of these variants (K26R and I468V) may affect binding characteristics between S protein of the virus and hACE2 receptor. We also noted marginal differences in gene expression for some populations in HapMap3 as compared to the Chinese population. CONCLUSION: Our studies reveal subtle changes in the genetics of hACE2 between human populations, but the magnitude of the difference was small and the significance is not clear in the absence of further in vitro and functional studies.","Li, Quan; Cao, Zanxia; Rahman, Proton",Mol Genet Genomic Med,,585
364214,Implications of the Covid-19 Pandemic: Canvassing Opinion from Planning Professionals,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Healthcare workers are particularly susceptible to developing COVID-19 owing to close and frequent contact with COVID-19 patients. This cross-sectional study aimed to describe prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among healthcare workers within a hospital trust and examine factors associated with increased prevalence of this antibody. METHODS: Data was obtained over a 4-week period in 2020 from a cross-sectional prospective survey of healthcare workers serving a multi-ethnic inner-city population who had immunoglobulin G SARS-CoV-2 antibody test. Anonymised socio-demographic data about staff were cross-referenced with these tests. RESULTS: Of 7,013 staff, 6,212 (89%) undertook the antibody test during this period. Overall detection rate was 26% (1,584/6,212). Univariate analyses revealed no differences in prevalence in terms of gender or age. Compared with white staff members (18%), rates were higher in black (38%) and Asian (27%) members (p<0.001). The rates in general wards (43%) were higher compared with other areas; in emergency medicine and intensive care, prevalence was 23% (p<0.001). Regarding professional groups, prevalence was highest among nursing and allied clinical services (28%), less in doctors (23%) and lower in non-clinical staff (19%). DISCUSSION: This large study has described prevalence of recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers and determined associations including ethnicity, professional groups and geographical areas within healthcare settings. This information will be useful in future COVID-19 studies examining the role of antibody testing both in general populations and in healthcare settings.","Patel, Mehool; Nair, Meera; Pirozzoli, Eric; Cienfuegos, Marta C; Aitken, Elizabeth",Clin Med (Lond),,585

However, its presence in certain populations, especially those with mild clinical symptoms, has not been clarified. The objective was to estimate the frequency of OD and TD, and its predictive validity in patients detected in Primary Care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in the Spanish National Health System. An epidemiological survey was administered to patients who were requested the PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. Odds ratio (OR) were estimated to measure the magnitude of the association between OD and TD and the existence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of these symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 infection were calculated. RESULTS: Of 1,038 patients screened, 20.1% had SARS-CoV-2 infection. OD and DG were present in 64.4% (95% CI 56.0-72.1) and 56.2% (95% CI 47.9-64.2) of the subjects with infection, respectively. The OR for OD was 12.2 (95% CI 8.26-18.06) and for TD was 7.95 (95% CI 5.48-11.53). TD presented a sensitivity of 41.1% (95% CI 34.4-46.1), a specificity of 91.9% (95% CI 89.8-93.7), a PPV of 56.2% (95% CI48.0-64.2) and a NPV of 86.1% (95% CI 83.6-88.3), while the OD showed a sensitivity of 45.0% (95% CI 37.6-51.5), a specificity of 93.7% (95% CI 91.8-95.0), a PPV of 64.4% (95% CI 56.0-72.1) and a NPV of 87.1% (95% CI 84.7-89.2). CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the subjects with SARS-CoV-2 infection have OD or TD. The presence of OD or TD could be of diagnostic utility due to its ability to predict infection in more than half of the cases.","Pérula de Torres, Luis Ángel; González-Lama, Jesús; Jiménez García, Celia; Sánchez Montero, Rosa; Rider Garrido, Faustino; Ortega López, Yolanda; Pajares Conde, Diego; Ramírez Baena, Miguel; Párraga Martínez, Ignacio; Romero-Rodríguez, Esperanza",Med Clin (Barc),,585

In this study, an interpretive multi-case research method was used to investigate how limited government-to-government resources in Ethiopia could enable the effective utilization of inter-government resources using the CC paradigm. Four government administrative districts (woredas) in the Amhara Region were purposively sampled. The findings revealed that Government officials could only identify intangible digital services and shared learning as shareable, but did not consider any tangible artifacts until prompted. Overall, the findings contribute to Information Systems discourse and digital government practice by providing insights into the role of CC models in maximizing limited government to government resources in low-income countries like Ethiopia. A creativity process to identify other shareable resources and prompt digital innovation is recommended. This is because there are few to no studies that investigate government to government resource sharing through a CC approach in such countries. The study also showed that in light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, there is a further reason for low-income countries to share whatever limited resources are available.","Gebeyehu, S.; Twinomurinzi, H.",Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries,,585
367776,Incidence and risk factors for moderate/severe COVID-19 in rheumatic diseases patients on hydroxychloroquine: a 24-week prospective cohort,2021,"OBJECTIVES: In Italy, the pandemic of COVID-19 resulted in congestion of hospitals and laboratories and probably determined an underestimation of the number of infected subjects, as the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was mainly performed on hospitalised patients. Therefore, limited data are available about the number of asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic subjects in the general population across time. To understand SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population, we have developed a cross-sectional study (the 'UNIversity against CORoNavirus study') to investigate infection trends in asymptomatic/paucisymptomatic subjects in Milan (Italy), between March and June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: The study population included 2023 subjects asymptomatic at the enrolment. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: A nasal mid-turbinate swab for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and blood specimen for testing serum antibodies (immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG) were collected. RESULTS: Subjects showing positivity for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and/or for anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig is 237 (11.7%). Only 1.2% (n=25) of the total population had a positive nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2 and the large majority (21/25) of them were observed in March. A total of 226 subjects (11%) had IgM (n=19; 0.9%), IgG (n=155; 7.7%) or both (n=52; 2.6%) against SARS-CoV-2. Subjects with a present or past SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ from other subjects as regards the number of cohabiting family members, travels, fever and upper and lower respiratory infection episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Results from the present study support the hypothesis that the actual spread of the virus in Lombardy was underestimated in the official records. However, as it is not known how long Ig persist, numbers should be taken cautiously.","Milani, Gregorio Paolo; Rota, Federica; Favero, Chiara; Dioni, Laura; Manenti, Alessandro; Hoxha, Mirjam; Pariani, Elena; Albetti, Benedetta; Pesatori, Angela Cecilia; Montomoli, Emanuele; Bollati, Valentina",BMJ Open,,585
367894,The Effect of COVID-19 on Medical Student Confidence,2021,"High education is an important and critical part of education all over the world. In last year, the world has been turned increasingly to online education due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic;therefore, improving this education system became an urgent matter. Online learning systems are a primal environment for acquiring educational data which can be from different sources, especially academic institutions. These data can be mainly used to analyze and extract utilizable information to help in understanding university students’ performance and identifying factors that affect it. To extract some meaningful information from these large volumes of data, academic organizations must mine the data with high accuracy. In this work, three different real datasets were selected, pre-processed, cleaned, and filtered for applying support vector machine (SVM) with multilayer perceptron kernel (MLP kernel) and optimize its parameters using simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to improve the objective function value. While examining the search space, SA has the advantage of escaping from local minima since it offers the chance for accepting the worse neighbor as a solution in a controlled manner. The results show that the designed system can determine the best SVM parameters using SA and therefore presents better model evaluation. © 2021, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

368324,Anticoagulation Practice Patterns in COVID-19: A Global Survey,2020,"The effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first trimester on the pregnant woman and the fetus remain unclear. We describe the complete follow-up of a pregnant woman with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first trimester. The woman tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs in her seventh week of gestation and was admitted to a local hospital for treatment. Although the woman had a BMI above 28 and a total gestational weight gain of 21 kg, no pregnancy complications or severe complications related to SARS-CoV-2 were reported. An ultrasound scan identified no fetal abnormalities at 22 weeks. The pregnancy ended at term (37 weeks), and the newborn's birth weight was 3100 g. Placental insufficiency was revealed by placental histology examination but this appeared not to be related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemical tests for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, spike protein 1, and nucleocapsid proteins were negative. However, ACE-2 was positive in samples of the placenta, umbilical cord and fetal membrane. The baby was followed up through to 10 days after birth and grew normally. Our results suggest that asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first trimester of pregnancy might not have significant harmful effects on the mother and the developing fetus. This finding may be of interest to the general public, midwives and general practitioners. However, large population studies are needed to confirm our findings.","He, Jian-Rong Xiao Yan-Hua Ding Wen Shi Ya-Ling He Xi Liu Xiao-Dan Zhang Guo-Zheng Li Sha-Sha Su Jin-Qing Liang Li Zeng Liang Li Fang Qiu Xiu",Case Reports in Women&#039;s Health,,585

Emphasis was placed on cytokines and vitamin D for determining susceptibility of illness. METHODS: A primary literature search of PubMed and Google Scholar for articles published between January 1, 2002 to May 31, 2020, was performed without language restrictions from May 8, 2020 to May 31, 2020. A focused second search was conducted from October 31, 2020 to November 2, 2020 for articles published between January 1, 2002 to October 31, 2020. Eligible articles were selected after evaluation of titles, abstracts, and references. A total of 45 were included in this review. RESULTS: Differing endotype classification schemes are used to determine cytokines present in chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, and allergies. While immunologic responses and biomarkers are primary methods of differentiation, recent literature has also implicated geographic distribution of chronic rhinosinusitis patients in accounting for cytokine variations. The cytokines of interest (IL-4, IL-13, and INF-Î³) present in the endotypes of these conditions may point towards protective mechanisms against COVID-19 through downregulation of the ACE2 receptor. These cytokines and Vitamin D highlight new areas of study for factors affecting SARS-CoV-2 virulence. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to understand the effects of Vitamin D and the various cytokines prevalent among endotypes of nasal/pharyngeal illnesses on COVID-19 pathogenesis. Findings may point towards epidemiologic trends of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and have future therapeutic indications.","Jain, Neil; Varman, Rahul; Tarbox, James A; Nguyen, Tam",Auris nasus larynx,,585

PROCESS: The first two patients worked at two hospitals but no staff from the two hospitals were infected. The suspected case and his two close contacts were confirmed to be infected within 12 h. The testing rate of individuals was low. The scope of screening was minimized to two related districts and the close contact tracing was completed within 12 h, which were precise and cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Active monitoring, precise epidemiological investigation and timely nucleic acid testing help discover new cases, minimize the scope of screening, and interrupt the transmission.","Shi, Ying; Jiang, Hong-Lin; Yang, Mei-Xia; Dong, Lin-Juan; Chen, Yue; Zhou, Yi-Biao; Jiang, Qing-Wu",Infect Dis Poverty,,585

Compared to other baselines, both automatic evaluation and human evaluation show better article-summary and cluster-summary entailment in generated summaries.

It is unknown to which extent presymptomatic residents and staff contribute to the spread of the virus. AIMS: To assess the contribution of asymptomatic and presymptomatic residents and staff in SARS-CoV-2 transmission during a large outbreak in a Dutch NH. METHODS: Observational study in a 185-bed NH with two consecutive testing strategies: testing of symptomatic cases only, followed by weekly facility-wide testing of staff and residents regardless of symptoms. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal testing with RT-PCR for SARs-CoV-2, including sequencing of positive samples, was conducted with a standardized symptom assessment. RESULTS: 185 residents and 244 staff participated. Sequencing identified one cluster. In the symptom-based test strategy period 3/39 residents were presymptomatic versus 38/74 residents in the period of weekly facility-wide testing (p-value<0.001). In total, 51/59 (91.1%) of SARS-CoV-2 positive staff was symptomatic, with no difference between both testing strategies (p-value 0.763). Loss of smell and taste, sore throat, headache or myalga was hardly reported in residents compared to staff (p-value <0.001). Median Ct-value of presymptomatic residents was 21.3, which did not differ from symptomatic (20.8) or asymptomatic (20.5) residents (p-value 0.624). CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms in residents and staff are insufficiently recognized, reported or attributed to a possible SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, residents without (recognized) symptoms showed the same potential for viral shedding as residents with symptoms. Weekly testing was an effective strategy for early identification of SARS-Cov-2 cases, resulting in fast mitigation of the outbreak.","van den Besselaar, Judith H; Sikkema, Reina S; Koene, Fleur M H P A; van Buul, Laura W; Oude Munnink, Bas B; Frénay, Ine; Te Witt, René; Koopmans, Marion P G; Hertogh, Cees M P M; Buurman, Bianca M",Age ageing,,585

Many studies have modeled the efficiency gains of specimen pooling, but few have systematically evaluated the dilution effect of pooling on the sensitivity of tests. Using the frequency distribution of cycle threshold (Ct ) values of our first 838 SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens, we modeled 100 specimens on the same frequency distribution. Given this distribution, we then tested dilutions of 1:5, 1:10, and 1:50 to find the percentage of specimens positive at each Ct value with each pool size. Using the frequency distribution and the percentage of specimens positive at each Ct value, we estimate that pools of 5 lead to 93% sensitivity, pools of 10 lead to 91% sensitivity, and pools of 50 lead to 81% sensitivity. Pools of 5 and 10 lead to some specimens with Ct values of &#8805;32 becoming negative, while pools of 50 lead to some specimens with Ct values of &#8805;28 becoming negative. These sensitivity estimates can inform laboratories seeking to implement pooling approaches as they seek to balance test efficiency with sensitivity.","Bateman, Allen C; Mueller, Shanna; Guenther, Kyley; Shult, Peter",J. med. virol,,585

Here, we identified candidate ammonia-tolerant syntrophic propionate-oxidising bacteria using propionate enrichment at high ammonia levels (0.7-0.8 g NH3 L-1 ) in continuously-fed reactors. We reconstructed 30 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the propionate-fed reactors, which revealed two novel species from the families Peptococcaceae and Desulfobulbaceae as syntrophic propionate-oxidising candidates. Both MAGs possess genomic potential for the propionate oxidation and electron transfer required for syntrophic energy conservation and, similar to ammonia-tolerant acetate degrading syntrophs, both MAGs contain genes predicted to link to ammonia and pH tolerance. Based on relative abundance, a Peptococcaceae sp. appeared to be the main propionate degrader and has been given the provisional name ""Candidatus Syntrophopropionicum ammoniitolerans"". This bacterium was also found in high-ammonia biogas digesters, using quantitative PCR. Acetate was degraded by syntrophic acetate-oxidising bacteria and the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic community consisted of Methanoculleus bourgensis and a yet to be characterised Methanoculleus sp. This work provides knowledge of cooperating syntrophic species in high-ammonia systems and reveals that ammonia-tolerant syntrophic propionate-degrading populations share common features, but diverge genomically and taxonomically from known species.","Singh, Abhijeet; Schnürer, Anna; Westerholm, Maria",Environ. microbiol,,585

Extraction of energy from the toxic MW with the latest gasification technology instead of conventional incineration is of utmost importance to promote sustainable development. This present study investigates the processing of MW for the generation of enriched hydrogen syngas using steam injected plasma gasifier. Modeling of Plasma gasifier was performed in Aspen Plus and Model validation was done with the experimental result and, a good agreement was attained. Sensitivity analysis was implemented on MW in which the influence of gasification temperature, equivalence ratio (ER), and Steam/Biomass (S/B) on the producer gas (PG) composition, gas yield, H2/CO ratio, cold gas efficiency (CGE), and the higher heating value (HHV) was calculated. Furthermore, Response surface methodology (RSM) has been incorporated for the multi-objective optimization of the variable gasification parameters. R2 values obtained from ANOVA for H2, CGE, and HHV are 98.62%, 99.10%, and 98.9% respectively. Using the response optimizer, the optimum values of H2, CGE, and HHV were found to be 0.43 (mole frac), 89.95%, and 7.49 MJ/Nm3 for temperature at 1560.600C, equivalence ratio 0.1, and S/B 0.99, respectively.

This has changed the way people live and are included socially.This paper focuses on the unexpected ways schools have altered and deepened social inclusion for children with learning disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.We interviewed six people: two people who work for a Local Authority, one Headteacher of a special school, one Special Educational Needs and Disability Consultant, one young person with a learning disability and her mother.The findings and conclusions show the ""new normal"" caused by COVID-19 can help to deepen social inclusion for children with learning disabilities. For example, it can help children communicate in alternative ways with their teachers and friends. It can help families to understand more about their son/daughter's educational abilities; this means they can advocate better for them. It can help professionals to meet the needs of children with learning disabilities more quickly.We do not enjoy living at a social distance from everyone else, but we do want to make sure that lessons can be learnt from this moment in time. Background: To slow the spread of COVID-19, on 20 March 2020, nurseries, schools and colleges across England were closed to all learners, apart from those who were children of key workers or were considered ""vulnerable."" As young people with learning disabilities, families, professionals and schools become acquainted with the Erfahrung of the new horizon brought about by COVID-19, the negativity of altered social inclusion is becoming the ""new normal."" Capturing this transitory moment in time, this paper reflexively analyses the curiously productive variables of altered ecological pathways to social inclusion for people with learning disabilities. Methods: Taking a hermeneutic stance, this paper draws on Gadamer's construction of the nature of new experiences. Focussed on the experience of social inclusion during the COVID-19 pandemic, semi-structured interviews were conducted with six key stakeholders. As the phenomenon in question was new, an inductive approach to thematic analysis was applied. Findings: The critical tenet of this paper is that the Erfahrung of COVID-19 has created the conditions for a ""new normal"" which have afforded children with learning disabilities altered opportunities for social inclusion, whether that be through increased power/agency for them and their families and/or new modes of connectedness leading to enhanced relationships. Conclusion: Whilst the impact of COVID-19 has been a negative one for many aspects of society, application of Simplican and Gadamer's theories on social inclusion and the nature of new experiences has permitted the surfacing of new possibilities for the social inclusion of children with learning disabilities.","Beaton, Mhairi C; Codina, Geraldene N; Wharton, Julie C",British journal of learning disabilities,,585

Aims were: (1) describe baseline patient characteristics and available unadjusted outcomes for episodes of care administered during COVID-19 using TR vs. traditional in-person care, (2) describe TR frequency levels by condition and telecommunication modes. METHODS: A descriptive retrospective observational design was used to report patient variables and outcomes including physical function, number of visits, and patient satisfaction, by TR frequency (few, most, or all visits) and telecommunication modes. Standardized differences were used to compare baseline characteristics between episodes with and without TR. RESULTS: Sample consisted of 222,680 patients [59% female; mean age (SD) = 55(18)]. Overall TR rate was 6% decreasing from 10% to 5% between 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2020. Outcome measures were available for 90% to 100% of episodes. Thirty-seven percent of clinicians administered care via TR. Patients treated using TR compared to in-person care were more likely to be younger, and live in large metropolitan areas. From those with TR, 55%, 20%, and 25% had TR during few, most, or all visits, respectively. TR care was administered equally across orthopedic body parts, with lower use for non-orthopedic conditions such as stroke, edema, and vestibular dysfunction. TR was primarily administered using synchronous (video or audio) modes. The rate of patients reported being very satisfied with their treatment results was 3% higher for no TR compared to TR. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide new knowledge about to whom and how TR is being administered during the pandemic in outpatient rehabilitation practices throughout the USA. The database assessed was found to be suitable for conducting studies on associations between TR and diverse outcome measures, controlling for a comprehensive set of patient characteristics, to advance best TR care models, and promote high quality care. IMPACT: This study provided detailed and robust descriptive information using an existing national patient database containing patient health and demographic characteristics, outcome measures, and TR administration data. Findings support the feasibility to conduct future studies on associations between TR care and patient outcomes, adjusting for a wide range of patient characteristics and clinical setting factors that may be associated with the probability of receiving TR. Finding of limited and decreasing use of TR over the study period calls for studies aimed to better understand facilitators and inhibitors of TR use by rehabilitation therapists during everyday practice to promote its use when clinically appropriate.","Werneke, Mark W; Deutscher, Daniel; Grigsby, David; Tucker, Carole A; Mioduski, Jerome E; Hayes, Deanna",Phys. ther,,585

372479,The corona chronicle-from history to hitherto-A perspective,2021,"Currently the entire human population is in the midst of a global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2). This highly pathogenic virus has to date caused >71 million infections and >1.6 million deaths in >180 countries. Several vaccines and drugs are being studied as possible treatments or prophylactics of this viral infection. M3CLpro (coronavirus main cysteine protease) is a promising drug target as it has a significant role in viral replication. Here we use the X-ray crystal structure of M3CLpro in complex with boceprevir to study the dynamic changes of the protease upon ligand binding. The binding free energy was calculated for water molecules at different locations of the binding site, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out for the M3CLpro/boceprevir complex, to thoroughly understand the chemical environment of the binding site. Several HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitors were tested in vitro against M3CLpro. Specifically, asunaprevir, narlaprevir, paritaprevir, simeprevir, and telaprevir all showed inhibitory effects on M3CLpro. Molecular docking and MD simulations were then performed to investigate the effects of these ligands on M3CLpro and to provide insights into the chemical environment of the ligand binding site. Our findings and observations are offered to help guide the design of possible potent protease inhibitors and aid in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Manandhar, Anjela; Blass, Benjamin E; Colussi, Dennis J; Almi, Imane; Abou-Gharbia, Magid; Klein, Michael L; Elokely, Khaled M",J Chem Inf Model,,585
372970,Virtual academic detailing (e-Detailing): A vital tool during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BackgroundWhile mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been exceedingly effective in preventing symptomatic viral infection, the features of immune response remain to be clarified. MethodsIn the present prospective observational study, 225 healthy individuals in Kumamoto General Hospital, Japan, who received two BNT162b2 doses in February 2021, were enrolled. Correlates of BNT162b2-elicited SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing activity (50% neutralization titer: NT50; assessed using infectious virions and live target cells) with SARS-CoV-2-S1-binding-IgG and -IgM levels, adverse effects (AEs), ages, and genders were examined. The average half-life of neutralizing activity and the average time length for the loss of detectable neutralizing activity were determined and the potency of serums against variants of concerns was also determined. FindingsSignificant rise in NT50s was seen in serums on day 28 post-1st dose. A moderate inverse correlation was seen between NT50s and ages, but no correlation was seen between NT50s and AEs. NT50s and IgG levels on day 28 post-1st dose and pain scores following the 2nd shot were greater in women than in men. The average half-life of neutralizing activity in the vaccinees was approximately 67.8 days and the average time length for their serums to lose the detectable neutralizing activity was 198.3 days. While serums from elite-responders (NT50s>1,500-fold: the top 4% among all participants NT50s) potently to moderately blocked the infectivity of variants of concerns, some serums with moderate NT50s failed to block the infectivity of a beta strain. InterpretationBNT162b2-elicited immune response has no significant association with AEs. BNT162b2-efficacy is likely diminished to under detection limit by 6-7 months post-1st shot. High-level neutralizing antibody-containing serums potently to moderately block the infection of SARS-CoV-2 variants; however, a few moderate-level neutralizing antibody-containing serums failed to do so. If BNT162b2-elicited immunity memory is short, an additional vaccine or other protective measures would be needed. Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWhile mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been exceedingly effective in preventing symptomatic viral infection, the salient features of immune response including the persistence of protection remain to be clarified. There is a report that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persist through 6 months after the second dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine (Doria-Rose et al. N Engl J Med. 2021;384:2259-2261); however, more definite immune kinetics following mRNA-vaccine-elicited protection have to be clarified. The mRNA-vaccine-elicited protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants are also to be determined. Added value of this studyIn the present prospective study, 225 twice-BNT162b2-dose-receiving individuals in Japan were enrolled. No significant correlation was seen between 50% neutralizing titers (NT50s), determined by using infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions and live target cells, and adverse effects. Largely, NT50s and IgG levels were greater in women than in men. Following 28 days post-2nd shot, significant reduction was seen in NT50s, IgG, and IgM levels. The average half-life of NT50s was [~]68 days and the average time-length for participants serums to lose the detectable activity was [~]198 days. Although serums from elite-responders potently to moderately blocked the infectivity of variants of concerns, some serums with moderate NT50s failed to block the infectivity of a beta strain. Implications of all the available evidenceBNT162b2 efficacy is likely to be diminished to under detection limit by 6-7 months post-1st shot on average. Individuals with moderate NT50s may fail to block beta variants. If BNT162b2-elicited immune memory is lost soon, additional vaccine(s) or other protective means would be needed.","Maeda, Kenji; Amano, Masayuki; Uemura, Yukari; Tsuchiya, Kiyoto; Matsushima, Tomoko; Noda, Kenta; Shimizu, Yosuke; Fujiwara, Asuka; Takamatsu, Yuki; Ichikawa, Yasuko; Nishimura, Hidehiro; Kinoshita, Mari; Matsumoto, Shota; Gatanaga, Hiroyuki; Yoshimura, Kazuhisa; Oka, Shinichi; Mikami, Ayako; Sugiura, Wataru; Sato, Toshiyuki; Yoshida, Tomokazu; Shimada, Shinya; Mitsuya, Hiroaki",,,585

Here, we report a highly reliable severity diagnostic biomarker, acetylated 676th lysine transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein (TGFBIp K676Ac). TGFBIp K676Ac was consistently elevated in the blood of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (n = 113), especially in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) compared to non-ICU patients. Patients' blood samples showed increased cytokines and lymphopenia, which are exemplary indicators of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Treatment with TGFBIp neutralizing antibodies suppressed the cytokine storm. The increased level of TGFBIp K676Ac in ICU patients suggests the promise of this protein as a reliable severity diagnostic biomarker for severe SARS-CoV-2 disease.","Park, Hee Ho; Kim, Hong Nam; Kim, Hyelim; Yoo, Youngbum; Shin, Hyosoo; Choi, Eun Young; Bae, Jong-Sup; Lee, Wonhwa",Sci.

373283,COVID-19: The Crossroads for Sinhala–Muslim Relations in Sri Lanka (preprint),2021,"The aim was to assess the ability of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load at first patient's hospital evaluation to predict unfavorable outcomes. We conducted a prospective cohort study including 321 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 through RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs. Quantitative Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA cycle threshold values were used to calculate the viral load in log10 copies/mL. Disease severity at the end of follow up was categorized into mild, moderate, and severe. Primary endpoint was a composite of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or death (n = 85, 26.4%). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load over the second quartile (&#8805; 7.35 log10 copies/mL, p = 0.003) and second tertile (&#8805; 8.27 log10 copies/mL, p = 0.01) were associated to unfavorable outcome in the unadjusted logistic regression analysis. However, in the final multivariable analysis, viral load was not independently associated with an unfavorable outcome. Five predictors were independently associated with increased odds of ICU admission and/or death: age &#8805; 70 years, SpO2, neutrophils > 7.5 × 103/µL, lactate dehydrogenase &#8805; 300 U/L, and C-reactive protein &#8805; 100 mg/L. In summary, nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load on admission is generally high in patients with COVID-19, regardless of illness severity, but it cannot be used as an independent predictor of unfavorable clinical outcome.","Salto-Alejandre, Sonsoles; Berastegui-Cabrera, Judith; Camacho-Martínez, Pedro; Infante-Domínguez, Carmen; Carretero-Ledesma, Marta; Crespo-Rivas, Juan Carlos; Márquez, Eduardo; Lomas, José Manuel; Bueno, Claudio; Amaya, Rosario; Lepe, José Antonio; Cisneros, José Miguel; Pachón, Jerónimo; Cordero, Elisa; Sánchez-Céspedes, Javier",Sci Rep,,585

In this setting, difficulties in aortic disease management were two-fold: new vascular complications related to COVID-19 infection and the need to guarantee prompt and correct treatment for the general ""non-COVID-19"" population. Furthermore, discomfort deriving from precautions to minimize the risk of virus transmission among patients and among health care professionals, the need to separate COVID-19-positive from COVID-19-negative patients, and the high incidence of postoperative complications in COVID-19 cases created a challenging scenario for cardiac operations. The aim of this review was to provide evidence derived from the published literature (case reports, case series, multicenter experience, and expert opinion) on the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on aortic vascular surgery services and interventions, describing COVID-19-related findings, intraoperative and postoperative outcomes, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on noninfectious aortic patients.","Bissacco, Daniele; Franchin, Marco; Piffaretti, Gabriele; Luzzani, Luca; D039,; Oria, Mario; Casana, Renato; Domanin, Maurizio; Bellosta, Raffaello; Trimarchi, Santi",Semin Vasc Surg,,585

374419,Mothers' and fathers' parenting attitudes during COVID-19,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an unprecedented need for rapid diagnostic testing to enable the efficient treatment and mitigation of COVID-19. The primary diagnostic tool currently employed is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which can have good sensitivity and excellent specificity. Unfortunately, implementation costs and logistical problems with reagents during the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have hindered its universal on demand adoption. Lateral flow assays (LFAs) represent a class of diagnostic that, if sufficiently clinically sensitive, may fill many of the gaps in the current RT-PCR testing regime, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To date, many serology LFAs have been developed, though none meet the performance requirements necessary for diagnostic use cases, primarily due to the relatively long delay between infection and seroconversion. However, on the basis of previously reported results from SARS-CoV-1, antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 assays may have significantly better clinical sensitivity than serology assays. To date, only a very small number of antigen-detecting LFAs have been developed. Development of a half-strip LFA is a useful first step in the development of any LFA format. In this work, we present a half-strip LFA using commercially available antibodies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. We have tested this LFA in buffer and measured an LOD of 0.65 ng/mL (95% CI of 0.53 to 0.77 ng/mL) ng/mL with recombinant antigen using an optical reader with sensitivity equivalent to a visual read. Further development, including evaluating the appropriate sample matrix, will be required for this assay approach to be made useful in a point of care setting, though this half-strip LFA may serve as a useful starting point for others developing similar tests.","Grant, Benjamin D; Anderson, Caitlin E; Williford, John R; Alonzo, Luis F; Glukhova, Veronika A; Boyle, David S; Weigl, Bernhard H; Nichols, Kevin P",Anal Chem,,585

While on the one hand, the government has to struggle with the strategies for control of COVID-19, on the other hand, other routine health services also need to be managed. Second, the infrastructure needs to be augmented to meet the potential epidemic surge of cases. Third, economic welfare and household income need to be guaranteed. All of these have complicated the routine ways in which the governments have dealt with various trade-offs to determine the health and public policies. In this paper, we outline key economic principles for the government to consider for policymaking, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic rightfully places long due attention of policymakers for investing in health sector.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Demographic, clinical, and treatment data were extracted from electronic records. Univariate and multivariable methods were performed to investigate the relationship between each variable and clinical outcome at 28 days of follow-up. Results: Between March 20 and June 30, 2020, 377 adults (56.8% male) were included in the study, of whom 85 (22.6%) died. Non-survivors were older on average than survivors (mean age, 56.7 years [SD 15.8] vs. 70.1 years [SD 13.9]) and more likely male (28 [32.9%] vs. 57 [67.1%]). Most patients had at least one underlying disease (333 [88.3%]), including arterial hypertension (149 [39.5%]), overweight (145 [38.5%]), obesity (114 [30.2%]) and diabetes mellitus (82 [21.8%]). Frequency of critical care admission (158 [41.9%]) and invasive mechanical ventilation (123 [32.6%]) was high. Age over 65 years (OR 9.26, 95% CI 3.29-26.01;p=0.00), ICU admission (OR 12.37, 95% CI 6.08-25.18;p=0.00), and arterial pH higher than 7.47 (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.08-0.74;p=0.01) were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. Model based on clinical characteristics on admission yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.869. Discussion and Conclusions: To december 2020, this single-center study is the first report of hospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Andean subregion. In this study of in-hospital patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia frequency of death was similar to what has been reported. ICU admission and use of invasive mechanical ventilation was high and most patients had a mild pneumonia at admission, according to CURB-65 and qSOFA scores.

In this manuscript, we investigated the primary symptoms and basic hematological presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the Bangladeshi patients. METHODOLOGY: This was a multicentre cross-sectional study done on COVID-19 patients tested positive by RT PCR in Bangladesh. Clinical features of mild to moderate degree of COVID-19 patients; hematological and biochemical admission day laboratory findings of moderate to severe degree hospitalized COVID-19 patients were analyzed. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients in Bangladesh commonly presented with fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and sore throat. But symptoms like myalgia, diarrhea, skin rash, headache, Abdominal pain/cramp, nausea, vomiting, restlessness, and a higher temperature of >100°F have a greater presentation rate and more frequent than other published studies. CRP and Prothrombin time was found to increase in all the patients. Serum ferritin, ESR, SGPT, and D-Dimer were increased among 53.85%, 80.43, 44%, and 25% patients. 17.39% of the patients had leucocytosis and neutrophilia, 28.26% presented with lymphocytopenia, and 62.52% had mild erythrocytopenia. The difference between the decrease hemoglobin count (higher in the male) and increased SGPT (higher in female) against gender was significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our study had evaluated a different expression in presenting symptoms of COVID-19 patients in Bangladesh. CRP, Prothrombin time, serum ferritin, ESR, SGPT, D-Dimer, erythrocytopenia, and lymphocytopenia can be assessments for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 disease. Decrease hemoglobin count (higher in the male) and increased SGPT (higher in female) establish these two markers as a good candidate for diagnostic value against gender.","Mohiuddin Chowdhury, Abu Taiub Mohammed; Karim, Md Rezaul; Mehedi, Hm Hamidullah; Shahbaz, Mohammad; Chowdhury, Md Wazed; Dan, Guo; He, Shuixiang",J Infect Dev Ctries,,585
376832,Replication analysis of the COVID-19 Worry Scale,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is no data regarding COVID-19 in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) patients in Latin America. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients included in RELACOEM, a LATAM registry of MS and NMOSD patients infected with COVID-19. METHODS: RELACOEM is a longitudinal, strictly observational registry of MS and NMOSD patients who suffer COVID-19 and Dengue in LATAM. Inclusion criteria to the registry were either: (1) a biologically confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis based on a positive result of a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on a nasopharyngeal swab; or (2) COVID-19-typical symptoms (triad of cough, fever, and asthenia) in an epidemic zone of COVID-19. Descriptive statistics were performed on demographic and clinical variables. The cohort was later stratified for MS and NMOSD and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify variables associated with hospitalizations/intensive critical units (ICU) admission. RESULTS: 145 patients were included in the registry from 15 countries and 51 treating physicians. A total of 129 (89%) were MS patients and 16 (11%) NMOSD. 81.4% patients had confirmed COVID-19 and 18.6% were suspected cases. 23 (15.8%) patients were hospitalized, 9 (6.2%) required ICU and 5 (3.4 %) died due to COVID-19. In MS patients, greater age (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05 - 1.25) and disease duration (OR 1.39, 95%CI 1.14-1.69) were associated with hospitalization/ICU. In NMOSD patients, a greater age (54.3 vs. 36 years, p=<0.001), increased EDSS (5.5 vs 2.9, p=0.0012) and disease duration (18.5 vs. 10.3 years, p=0.001) were significantly associated with hospitalization/ICU. CONCLUSION: we found that in MS patients, age and disease duration was associated with hospitalization and ICU admission requirement, while age, disease duration and EDSS was associated in NMOSD.","Alonso, Ricardo; Silva, Berenice; Garcea, Orlando; Diaz, Patricio E Correa; Dos Passos, Giordani Rodrigues; Navarro, Deyanira A Ramirez; Valle, Luis A Garcia; Salinas, Luis C Rodriguez; Negrotto, Laura; Luetic, Geraldine; Tkachuk, Verónica A; Míguez, Jimena; de Bedoya, Fernando Hamuy Diaz; Goiry, Lorna Galleguillos; Sánchez, Nicia E Ramírez; Burgos, Marcos; Steinberg, Judith; Balbuena, Maria E; Alvarez, Priscilla Monterrey; López, Pablo A; Ysrraelit, María C; León, Rosalba A; Cohen, Aron Benzadon; Gracia, Fernando; Molina, Omaira; Casas, Magdalena; Deri, Norma H; Pappolla, Agustín; Patrucco, Liliana; Cristiano, Edgardo; Tavolini, Dario; Nadur, Debora; Granda, Ana M Toral; Weiser, Roberto; Cassará, Fátima Pagani; Sinay, Vladimiro; Rodríguez, Claudia Cárcamo; Lazaro, Luciana G; Menichini, María L; Piedrabuena, Raúl; Escobar, Geraldine Orozco; Carrá, Adriana; Chertcoff, Anibal; Pujols, Biany Santos; Vrech, Carlos; Tarulla, Adriana; Carvajal, René; Mainella, Carolina; Becker, Jefferson; Peeters, Liesbet M",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,585

377224,Mathematical modelling of the COVID-19 pandemic with demographic effects,2021,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the longitudinal trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is crucial for diagnosis of prior infection and predicting future immunity. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal analysis of COVID19 convalescents, using neutralizing antibody assays and SARS-CoV-2 serologic assay platforms employing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) antigens. RESULTS: Sensitivities of serologic assays to diagnose prior SARS-CoV-2 infection changed with time. One widely used commercial platform that had an initial sensitivity of >95% declined to 71% at 81-100 days post diagnosis. The trajectories of median binding antibody titers measured over ~3 to 4 months were not dependent on the use of SARS-CoV-2 N or S proteins as antigen. The median neutralization titer decreased by ~45% per month. Each serological assay gave quantitative antibody titers that correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers, but S-based serological assay measurements better predicted neutralization potency. Correlation between S-binding and neutralization titers deteriorated with time and decreases in neutralization titers were not predicted by changes in S-binding antibody titers. CONCLUSIONS: Different SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays are more or less well suited for surveillance versus prediction of serum neutralization potency. Extended follow up should facilitate the establishment of appropriate serologic correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection.","Muecksch, Frauke; Wise, Helen; Batchelor, Becky; Squires, Maria; Semple, Elizabeth; Richardson, Claire; McGuire, Jacqueline; Clearly, Sarah; Furrie, Elizabeth; Greig, Neil; Hay, Gordon; Templeton, Kate; Lorenzi, Julio C C; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Jenks, Sara; Bieniasz, Paul D",J. infect. dis,,585
377343,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Thromboembolic Disease: A Report of Three Patients With Pulmonary Embolism,2020,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a worldwide rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients fed enterally and parenterally at home are exposed to the same risk of infection as the general population, but more prone to complications than others. Therefore the guidance for care-givers and care-takers of these patients is needed. METHODS: The literature search identified no relevant systematic reviews or studies on the subject. Therefore a panel of 21 experts from 13 home medical nutrition (HMN) centres in Poland was formed. Twenty-three key issues relevant to the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 in the HMN settings were identified and discussed. Some statements diverge from the available nutrition, surgical or ICU guidelines, some are based on the best available experience. Each topic was discussed and assessed during two Delphi rounds subsequently. Statements were graded strong or weak based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. RESULTS: the panel issued 23 statements, all of them were graded strong. Two scored 85.71% agreement, eleven 95.23%, and ten 100%. The topics were: infection control, enrolment to HMN, logistics and patient information. CONCLUSIONS: the position paper present pragmatic statements for HMN to be implemented in places without existing protocols for SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

379254,"Population models, mathematical epidemiology, and the COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"OBJECTIVE: The anxiety-related insomnia and other sleep disorders were mentioned as possible side effects of quarantine and stay-at-home conditions. The questions to be explored were: Are there discernable differences in hours of sleep and sleep habits between the normal operational environment and the stay-at-home condition? and How seriously anxiety-induced insomnia or other sleep disorders may affect individuals during the stay-at-home? METHODS: This international prospective study analyzed results from the sleep-wake patterns questionnaire, daily logs, and interviews. During COVID-19 pandemic, surveys were administered to the healthy volunteers with stay-at-home for 14 days or more, without previous sleep disorders; volunteers were not involved in online education/work daily timetable-related activities. RESULTS: We analyzed 14,000 subjects from 11 countries with average stay-at-home of 62 days. The most significant changes in sleep occurred during the first 14 days of stay-at-home. The difference in the sleep duration between weekdays and weekends disappeared. Most of the participants discontinued using alarm clocks. The total sleep time increased in duration up to 9:10 ± 1:16 to the end of the quarantine/stay-at-home (+1:34, p = 0.02). The age-dependent changes in napping habits occurred. Only 1.8% of participants indicated insomnia during the first 14-day period with a decline to 0.5% after two months of stay-at-home. CONCLUSION: During the stay-at-home situation, both duration and timing of sleep significantly differ from those of daily routine and most humans sleep longer than in a schedule-dependent operational environment. An appearance of anxiety-induced insomnia is extremely rare if a healthy individual is already in the stay-at-home situation.","Roitblat, Yulia; Burger, Jacob; Leit, Aidan; Nehuliaieva, Liliia; Umarova, Gulrukh Sh; Kaliberdenko, Vitalii; Kulanthaivel, Shanmugaraj; Buchris, Noa; Shterenshis, Michael",J Psychosom Res,,585

We expect a slowdown in new financial regulation, continued firm-level consolidation, and a continued rise of business services related to finance. The application of new financial technologies is likely to accelerate, affecting retail banking in particular, but will not necessarily be led by FinTech firms. Local and regional financial centres are likely to face larger challenges than leading international centres. As the panic and partial recovery in financial markets in March and April 2020 highlighted the significance of the international monetary hierarchy, with the US$ in the lead, a radical shift of financial power to Asia seems unlikely.","Wójcik, Dariusz; Ioannou, Stefanos",Tijdschrift voor economische en sociale geografie,,585

However, there is a growing body of evidence pointing to a broad and more complex disorder of pro-inflammatory and anti-viral responses with disturbed interferon signaling in COVID-19. METHODS: In this prospective single-center registry, we included SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and patients with similar symptoms and severity of disease but negative for SARS-CoV-2 admitted to the emergency department and compared their serum protein expression profiles. RESULTS: Interleukin-6 abundance was similar in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n = 24) compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative control (n = 61). In contrast, we observed a specific upregulation of the immunomodulatory protein progranulin (GRN). High GRN abundance was associated with adverse outcomes and increased expression of interleukin-6 in COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The data from this registry reveals that GRN is specifically upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients while interleukin-6 may serve as marker for disease severity. The potential of GRN as a biomarker and a possible impact of increased GRN expression on interferon signaling, virus elimination, and virus-induced lung tissue damage in COVID-19 should be further explored.","Rieder, Marina; Wirth, Luisa; Pollmeier, Luisa; Jeserich, Maren; Goller, Isabella; Baldus, Niklas; Schmid, Bonaventura; Busch, Hans-Joerg; Hofmann, Maike; Thimme, Robert; Rieg, Siegbert; Kern, Winfried; Bode, Christoph; Duerschmied, Daniel; Lother, Achim",J. infect. dis,,585

This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients. METHODS: One hundred sixteen COVID-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020. The recorded information includes demographic data, medical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography scans, and treatment measures. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was detected by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Twelve (10.8%) patients showed mild increase of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine (<26 µmol/L within 48 h), and 8 (7.2%) patients showed trace or 1+ albuminuria in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD). All these patients did not meet the diagnostic criteria of AKI. In addition, 5 patients with CKD who were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) before admission were confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed as COVID-19. In addition to therapy for COVID-19, CRRT was also applied 3 times weekly during hospitalization for these 5 patients with CKD. In the course of treatment, the renal function indicators showed stable state in all 5 patients with CKD, without exacerbation of CKD, and pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed. All 5 patients with CKD were survived. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without CKD, and 1 patient had a positive for SARS-CoV-2 open reading frame 1ab from 5 cases with CKD. CONCLUSION: AKI was uncommon in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection does not result in AKI, or aggravate CKD in the COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Luwen; Li, Xun; Chen, Hui; Yan, Shaonan; Li, Dong; Li, Yan; Gong, Zuojiong",Am J Nephrol,,585

The presence of viral RNA in samples by nucleic acid (NA) molecular analysis is the only method available to diagnose COVID-19 disease and to assess patients' viral load. Since the demand for laboratory reagents has increased, there has been a worldwide shortage of RNA extraction kits. We, therefore, developed a fast and cost-effective viral genome isolation method that, combined with quantitative RT-PCR assay, detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patient samples. The method relies on the addition of Proteinase K followed by a controlled heat-shock incubation and, then, E gene evaluation by RT-qPCR. It was validated for sensitivity, specificity, linearity, reproducibility, and precision. It detects as low as 10 viral copies/sample, is rapid, and has been characterized in 60 COVID-19-infected patients. Compared to automated extraction methods, our pretreatment guarantees the same positivity rate with the advantage of shortening the time of the analysis and reducing its cost. This is a rapid workflow meant to aid the healthcare system in the rapid identification of infected patients, such as during a pathogen-related outbreak. For its intrinsic characteristics, this workflow is suitable for large-scale screenings.","Mio, Catia; Cifù, Adriana; Marzinotto, Stefania; Bergamin, Natascha; Caldana, Chiara; Cattarossi, Silvia; Cmet, Sara; Cussigh, Annarosa; Martinella, Romina; Zucco, Jessica; Verardo, Roberto; Schneider, Claudio; Marcon, Barbara; Zampieri, Stefania; Pipan, Corrado; Curcio, Francesco",Dis Markers,,585

The two most important diagnostic procedures used to evaluate tubal patency are hysterosalpingography and laparoscopy. Objectives: To asses the hysterosalpingography and laparoscopy results of patients diagnosed with infertility and investigate the diagnostic value of hysterosalpingography in patients with tubal factor infertility. Methods: The hysterosalpingography and laparoscopy results of 208 patients who presented to the Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic at Dicle University, Faculty of Medicine between January 2014- January 2018 were retrospectively evaluated. Hysterosalpingography and laparoscopy results were compared with regard to the investigation of the presence of tubal obstruction and of the pelvic structures that could cause tubal obstruction. The specificity, sensitivity, positive, and negative predictive values of hysterosalpingography were computed. Results: The number of patients evaluated was 208. The ratio of primary infertile patients was 57.2% and 42.8% was secondary infertile. Hysterosalpingography was found to have a specificity of 64.6%, the sensitivity of 81.3%, the positive predictive value of 56.4%, and a negative predictive value of 86% in the determination of tubal obstruction. Conclusion: Patients with suspected tubal infertility can primarily be examined using hysterosalpingography in consideration of the invasive nature and the higher complication rate of laparoscopy.","Gündüz, Reyhan; Agaçayak, Elif; Okutucu, Gülcan; Karuserci, Özge Kömürcü; Peker, Nurullah; Çetinçakmak, Mehmet Güli; Gül, Talip",Afr Health Sci,,585

There are both biological (sex) and socio-cultural (gender) factors, compounded by socio-economic factors and ethnicity, that impact on the aftermath of what has occurred over the short time that this novel coronavirus has been circulating the world. The potential life-long morbidity as a result of the infection and as a consequence of highly invasive critical care treatment needs to be factored into the rehabilitation of survivors. There are also many men whose lives will have been severely affected both physically and emotionally by the pandemic without ever contracting the disease, with the widespread disruption to normal existence and its impact on their social world and the economy. The implications of the closure of many healthcare services over the initial lockdown will also have both a shorter- and longer-term impact on other diseases due to missed early diagnosis and disrupted treatment regimes. Getting effective public health messages out to the population is critical and this current pandemic is demonstrating that there needs to be a more focused view on men's health behavior. Without effective public support for preventative action, the more likely the disease will continue its path unabated. This review explores the wider ramifications of the disease both for those men who have survived the disease and those that have been affected by the wider social effects of the pandemic. The pandemic should be a wake-up call for all involved in the planning and delivery of health and social care for the greater attention to the central role of sex and gender.","White, Alan",Postgrad Med,,585

386834,Servant Leadership towards the 21st Rich Media Technologies amidst Covid-19,2020,"Conjugation of antibiotics with polymers is an emerging strategy to improve the performance of these important drugs. Here, the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) was conjugated with amphiphilic poly(2-oxazoline) (POx) block copolymers to investigate whether the activity of the antibiotic was enhanced due to additionally induced membrane activity. The resulting polymer-antibiotic conjugates (PACs) are an order of magnitude more active against the bacterial strain Staphylococcus aureus than CIP and show high activities against numerous pathogenic bacterial strains. Their high activity depends on an optimal hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance (HHB) of the POx tail. Mechanistic studies revealed that the derivatization of CIP required for the polymer conjugation lowers the affinity of the antibiotic to its target topoisomerase IV. However, the amphiphilic PACs are most likely concentrated within the bacterial cytoplasm, which overcompensates the loss of affinity and results in high antibacterial activity. In addition, the development of resistance in S. aureus and Escherichia coli is slowed down. More importantly, the amphiphilic PACs are active against CIP-resistant S. aureus and E. coli. The PACs with the highest activity are not cytotoxic toward human stem cells and do not lyse blood cells in saturated solution.","Romanovska, Alina; Keil, Johanna; Tophoven, Jonas; Oruc, Murat Furkan; Schmidt, Martin; Breisch, Marina; Sengstock, Christina; Weidlich, Daniela; Klostermeier, Dagmar; Tiller, Joerg C",Mol. pharm,,585

COVID 19 tends to have poorer prognosis in cancer patients. Additionally, we have no well-established guidelines for management of these patients during pandemic, in terms of treatment of 'cancer' and treatment of 'COVID 19'. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are given without any break in cancer patients to have better survival outcomes in daily routine. However, there is no well-established data to continue or delay ALK inhibitors in lung cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV2. Concomittant use of ALK inhibitors and COVID 19 antiviral treatment is a dilemma because of the lack of data in this area. CASE REPORT: A 47-year old female metastatic ALK positive nonsquamous cell lung cancer patient on alectinib, a second generation ALK inhibitor was diagnosed with symptomatic COVID 19. She was given favipiravir for COVID 19 while continuing alectinib.Management and outcome: The patient continued alectinib during COVID 19 antiviral treatment without any break. She tolerated 'concomittant' alectinib & favipiravir. She had partial remission after three months of alectinib without any dose adjustment despite active COVID 19 medication. DISCUSSION: To best of our knowledge, this is the first case who continued alectinib without dose adjustment during antiviral COVID-19 medication without clinically worsening. There is limited data about 'concomittant' use of TKIs and antiviral COVID 19 medication in the literature. There are some case reports, but they generally tended to delay or suspend TKIs during COVID 19 antiviral medication. Our case differs from them in terms of continuation of alectinib without any break or additional side effects during favipiravir for symptomatic COVID 19. We consider that our case might contribute to the literature in terms of management of cancer patients on targeted therapy during COVID 19 antiviral treatment. However, clinical trials are needed in this area.","Akkus, Mehmet Hadi; Kaman, Omur; Dogan, Mutlu",J Oncol Pharm Pract,,585

However, the scarcity of donor availability remains a major hurdle for receiving this novel therapy, especially in the context of the rapidly spreading severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) pandemic. We report the case of a patient in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with advanced HF who was glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient and had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy, chronic kidney disease stage II, and hyperlipidemia. He was referred for HT abroad and was subsequently caught in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York, the US state most affected by the crisis at the time. Despite limited experience with favipiravir, we judged it to be the most appropriate agent with this patient's complex history given the lower risk for QT prolongation, no need for renal-dose adjustment, and no reported drug-drug interactions. Given the limited clinical experience with this agent, particularly for our patient, we decided to adopt strategies to mitigate and monitor the potential for QT prolongation. We outline the logistical, clinical, and pharmacological challenges that the poly-morbid patient and our HT program in the Middle-East faced under those novel circumstances.","Atallah, Bassam; Hamour, Iman; Mallah, Saad I; Bonilla, Maria-Fernanda; Bader, Feras",Drugs Ther Perspect,,585

One of the most important applications that has been proposed is utilizing information generated from social networks as a supplemental health surveillance system to monitor disease epidemics. At the time this research was conducted in 2020, the COVID-19 virus had evolved into a global pandemic, forcing many countries to implement preventative measures to halt its expanse. Health surveillance has been a powerful tool in placing further preventative measures, however it is not a perfect system, and slowly collected, misidentified information can prove detrimental to these efforts. This research proposes a new potential surveillance avenue through unsupervised machine learning using dynamic, evolutionary variants of clustering algorithms DBSCAN and the Louvain method to allow for community detection in temporal networks. This technique is paired with geographical data collected directly from the social media Twitter, to create an effective and accurate health surveillance system that grows as time passes. The experimental results show that the proposed system is promising and has the potential to be an advancement on current machine learning health surveillance techniques.","Elgazzar, Heba Spurlock Kyle Bogart Tanner",Machine Learning with Applications,,585

Consequently, a search is on for a treatment that can bring the pandemic to an end. However, treatments (vaccine, antiviral, plasma) that are directed at specific viral proteins (RNA polymerase, spike proteins) may not work well against all strains of the virus. Therefore, it is hypothesized that a therapy based on multiple treatments is needed for COVID-19 patients and to bring the pandemic to an end. Here, it is proposed that a combination of cool air therapy (CAT) and purified air technology (PAT) in an oxygen species cool air respirator (OSCAR) could be used to reduce viral (SARS-CoV-2) load and severity of illness in COVID-19 patients through the individual dose-response relationship. In addition, the proposed therapy (CAT + PAT in OSCAR), which works by a more general physical and chemical mechanism, should work well with other treatments (vaccine, antiviral, plasma) that target specific viral proteins (RNA polymerase, spike proteins) to provide a safe and effective multiple therapy approach for ending the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2.","Oscar, Thomas P",Med Hypotheses,,585
393600,Beyond PPE: Emotional Protection for Frontline Medical Professionals Amid COVID-19,2020,"The coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus, has provoked a global healthcare and economic crisis. The control over the spread of the disease requires an efficient and scalable laboratory-based strategy for testing the population based on multiple platforms to provide rapid and accurate diagnosis. With the onset of the pandemic, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method has become a standard diagnostic tool, which has received wide clinical use. In large-scale and repeated examinations, these tests can identify infected patients with COVID-19, with their accuracy, however, dependent on many factors, while the entire process takes up to 6-8 h. Here we also describe a number of serological systems for detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. These are used to assess the level of population immunity in various categories of people, as well as for retrospective diagnosis of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 in patients. However, the widespread use of traditional diagnostic tools in the context of the rapid spread of COVID-19 is hampered by a number of limitations. Therefore, the sharp increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 necessitates creation of new rapid, inexpensive, sensitive, and specific tests. In this regard, we focus on new laboratory technologies such as loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), which have proven to work well in the COVID-19 diagnostics and can become a worthy alternative to traditional laboratory-based diagnostics resources. To cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, the healthcare system requires a combination of various types of laboratory diagnostic testing techniques, whodse sensitivity and specificity increases with the progress in the SARS-CoV-2 research. The testing strategy should be designed in such a way to provide, depending on the timing of examination and the severity of the infection in patients, large-scale and repeated examinations based on the principle: screening-monitoring-control. The search and development of new methods for rapid diagnostics of COVID-19 in laboratory, based on new analytical platforms, is still a highly important and urgent healthcare issue. In the final part of the review, special emphasis is made on the relevance of the concept of personalized medicine to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in the light of the recent studies carried out to identify the causes of variation in individual susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of treatment.","Andryukov, Boris G; Besednova, Natalya N; Kuznetsova, Tatyana A; Fedyanina, Ludmila N",,,585

However, it remained to be addressed why this was the case. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To find the factors that potentially protect females from COVID-19, we recruited all confirmed patients hospitalized at three branches of Tongji Hospital (n=1902) from January 28 to March 8, 2020, and analyzed the correlation between menstrual status (n=509ï¼including 68 from Mobile Cabin Hospital)/female hormones (n=78)/ cytokines related to immunity and inflammation(n=263), and the severity/clinical outcomes in female patients under 60 years of age.Non-menopausal female patients had milder severity and better outcome compared with age-matched men (p<0.01/p<0.01). Menopausal patients had longer hospitalization times than non-menopausal patients ( hazard ratio [HR], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-3.46ï¼p= 0.033). Both anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) and estradiol (E2) showed a negative correlation with severity of infection (AHR=0.146/0.304, 95%CI = [0.026-0.824]/[0.092-1.001], p=0.029/0.05). E2 levels were negatively correlated with IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF&#945; in luteal phase (Pearson Correlation=-0.592, -0.558, -0.545, -0.623; p=0.033, 0.048, 0.054, 0.023), and with C3 in follicular phase (Pearson Correlation=-0.651; p=0.030). CONCLUSION: Menopause is an independent risk factor for female COVID-19 patients. AMH and E2 are potential protective factors, negatively correlated with COVID-19's severity, among which E2 is attributed to its regulation of cytokines related to immunity and inflammation. Hormone supplement might be a potential therapy for COVID-19 patients.","Ding, Ting; Zhang, Jinjin; Wang, Tian; Cui, Pengfei; Chen, Zhe; Jiang, Jingjing; Zhou, Su; Dai, Jun; Wang, Bo; Yuan, Suzhen; Ma, Wenqing; Ma, Lingwei; Rong, Yueguang; Chang, Jiang; Miao, Xiaoping; Ma, Xiangyi; Wang, Shixuan",Clin Infect Dis,,585

To this end, we proposed a new method based on the minimization of the Sobolev norm in graph signal processing. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in two COVID-19 databases provided by Johns Hopkins University. In the same way, we prove the benefits of the convergence rate of the Sobolev reconstruction method by relying on the condition number of the Hessian associated with the underlying optimization problem of our method.","Giraldo, Jhony H.; Bouwmans, Thierry",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.00336v1.pdf,585

The secondary aim was to identify factors that were associated with developing COVID-19 during the postoperative period. METHODS: A multicentre retrospective study was conducted of all patients presenting to nine centres over a 50-day period during the COVID-19 pandemic (1 March 2020 to 19 April 2020) with a minimum of 50 days follow-up. Patient demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, priority (urgent or elective), procedure type, COVID-19 status, and postoperative mortality were recorded. RESULTS: During the study period, 1,659 procedures were performed in 1,569 patients. There were 68 (4.3%) patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19. There were 85 (5.4%) deaths postoperatively. Patients who had COVID-19 had a significantly lower survival rate when compared with those without a proven SARS-CoV-2 infection (67.6% vs 95.8%, p < 0.001). When adjusting for confounding variables (older age (p < 0.001), female sex (p = 0.004), hip fracture (p = 0.003), and increasing ASA grade (p < 0.001)) a diagnosis of COVID-19 was associated with an increased mortality risk (hazard ratio 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 3.12; p = 0.014). A total of 62 patients developed COVID-19 postoperatively, of which two were in the elective and 60 were in the urgent group. Patients aged > 77 years (odds ratio (OR) 3.16; p = 0.001), with increasing ASA grade (OR 2.74; p < 0.001), sustaining a hip (OR 4.56; p = 0.008) or periprosthetic fracture (OR 14.70; p < 0.001) were more likely to develop COVID-19 postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Perioperative COVID-19 nearly doubled the background postoperative mortality risk following surgery. Patients at risk of developing COVID-19 postoperatively (patients > 77 years, increasing morbidity, sustaining a hip or periprosthetic fracture) may benefit from perioperative shielding.

During the time of the global coronavirus pandemic, maintenance of social distancing and self-isolation might complicate regular multidisciplinary care of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy but on the other hand may lead to new medical care telehealth solutions. The aim of the study was to investigate patients' situation regarding rehabilitation in the pandemic, to establish an online rehabilitation program and motor assessment and to determine the needs of telerehabilitation in this group. METHODS: The project involved 69 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The rehabilitation program was presented during online workshops for patients and caregivers. The same program was recorded on video and published in the internet. The online motor assessment tool consisted of six motor tests, caregivers were asked to perform the tasks and share a photograph of the patient's posture using a designed app. RESULTS: In the nonambulant group the emphasis was placed on chest physiotherapy, stretching of upper extremities, positioning and wheelchair ergonomics. The program for the ambulant group focused on lower extremities stretching and full body exercises. Response rate for the workshops for ambulant patients was 29.7%, and only 9.0% for nonambulant patients. Videos showing exercises were displayed 132 times within a month. CONCLUSION: With the physiotherapist guidance (online communication or video) patients with caregivers' help can continue home based rehabilitation. Online videos/instructions/video guidelines are more acceptable by parents/caregivers of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy than live workshops.","Sobierajska-Rek, Agnieszka; Manski, Lukasz; Jablonska-Brudlo, Joanna; Sledzinska, Karolina; Ucinska, Aleksandra; Wierzba, Jolanta",Wien. klin.

So far, sewage testing has been increasingly employed as an alternative surveillance tool for this disease. However, sampling site characteristics impact the testing results and should be addressed in the early use stage of this emerging tool. In this study, we implemented the sewage testing for SARS-CoV-2 virus across sampling sites with different sewage system characteristics. We first validated a testing method using ""positive"" samples from a hospital treating COVID-19 patients. This method was used to test 107 sewage samples collected during the third wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong (from June 8 to September 29, 2020), covering sampling sites associated with a COVID-19 hospital, public housing estates, and conventional sewage treatment facilities. The highest viral titer of 1975 copy/mL in sewage was observed in a sample collected from the isolation ward of the COVID-19 hospital. Sewage sampling at individual buildings detected the virus 2 days before the first cases were identified. Sequencing of the detected viral fragment confirmed an identical nucleotide sequence to that of the SARS-CoV-2 isolated from human samples. The virus was also detected in sewage treatment facilities, which serve populations of approximately 40,000 to more than one million people.","Xu, Xiaoqing; Zheng, Xiawan; Li, Shuxian; Lam, Nga Sze; Wang, Yulin; Chu, Daniel K W; Poon, Leo L M; Tun, Hein Min; Peiris, Malik; Deng, Yu; Leung, Gabriel M; Zhang, Tong",Sci Total Environ,,585

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: UK Biobank. PARTICIPANTS: 49-83 year olds (in 2020) from a general population study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Confirmed COVID-19 infection (positive SARS-CoV-2 test). Incident influenza and pneumonia were obtained from primary care data. Poisson regression was used to study the association of exposure variables with outcomes. RESULTS: Among 235 928 participants, 397 had confirmed COVID-19. After multivariable adjustment, modifiable risk factors were higher body mass index and higher glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) (RR 1.28 and RR 1.14 per SD increase, respectively), smoking (RR 1.39), slow walking pace as a proxy for physical fitness (RR 1.53), and use of blood pressure medications as a proxy for hypertension (RR 1.33). Higher forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were both associated with lower risk (RR 0.84 and RR 0.83 per SD increase, respectively). Non-modifiable risk factors included male sex (RR 1.72), black ethnicity (RR 2.00), socioeconomic deprivation (RR 1.17 per SD increase in Townsend Index), and high cystatin C (RR 1.13 per SD increase). The risk factors overlapped with pneumonia somewhat, less so for influenza. The associations with modifiable risk factors were generally stronger for COVID-19, than pneumonia or influenza. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that modification of lifestyle may help to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and could be a useful adjunct to other interventions, such as social distancing and shielding of high risk.","Ho, Frederick K; Celis-Morales, Carlos A; Gray, Stuart R; Katikireddi, S Vittal; Niedzwiedz, Claire L; Hastie, Claire; Ferguson, Lyn D; Berry, Colin; Mackay, Daniel F; Gill, Jason Mr; Pell, Jill P; Sattar, Naveed; Welsh, Paul",BMJ Open,,585

401794,Self-management for elderly during the covid-19 pandemic,2021,"Rapid detection and identification of novel viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, is critical to treat, isolate, or hospitalize those infected, ultimately, to curb the spread of the virus. Diagnostic assays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are considered the gold standard for testing, but are labor-intensive and/or involve creating probe molecules specific to the virus. We propose Raman spectroscopy as an alternative method of detection because it can be label-free and can offer identifying information on many analytes within a sample. Specifically, we are developing a vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) Raman spectrometer using an incoherent excitation source that emits the hydrogen Lyman-α line radiation at 121.57 nm. The main benefit of using a VUV source is that the Raman scattering cross-section is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength, which means that VUV photons would yield several orders of magnitude higher scattering cross-sections than excitation in the visible or near-infrared. In addition, the 121.57 nm wavelength transmits up to 2 cm in dry air, so the analyte can be oriented in standard testing formats. We have been successful in producing strong and consistent HLA emission using both a dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) plasma source and a commercial source. In the near future, we expect to produce consistent Raman signatures in solid and liquid media. HLAS will transform diagnostic medicine and several other industries through its powerful capabilities of detecting real-time infections and important health markers. © 2021 SPIE.","Dmitrovic, S.; Molnar, B.; Kim, Y.

The study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a community-based population with acute loss of smell and/or taste and to compare the frequency of COVID-19 associated symptoms in participants with and without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. It also evaluated whether smell or taste loss are indicative of COVID-19 infection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Text messages, sent via primary care centers in London, United Kingdom, invited people with loss of smell and/or taste in the preceding month, to participate. Recruitment took place between 23 April 2020 and 14 May 2020. A total of 590 participants enrolled via a web-based platform and responded to questions about loss of smell and taste and other COVID-19-related symptoms. Mean age was 39.4 years (SD ± 12.0) and 69.1% (n = 392) of participants were female. A total of 567 (96.1%) had a telemedicine consultation during which their COVID-19-related symptoms were verified and a lateral flow immunoassay test that detected SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies was undertaken under medical supervision. A total of 77.6% of 567 participants with acute smell and/or taste loss had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; of these, 39.8% (n = 175) had neither cough nor fever. New loss of smell was more prevalent in participants with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, compared with those without antibodies (93.4% versus 78.7%, p < 0.001), whereas taste loss was equally prevalent (90.2% versus 89.0%, p = 0.738). Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was 3 times more likely in participants with smell loss (OR 2.86; 95% CI 1.27-6.36; p < 0.001) compared with those with taste loss. The limitations of this study are the lack of a general population control group, the self-reported nature of the smell and taste changes, and the fact our methodology does not take into account the possibility that a population subset may not seroconvert to develop SARS-CoV-2 antibodies post-COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that recent loss of smell is a highly specific COVID-19 symptom and should be considered more generally in guiding case isolation, testing, and treatment of COVID-19.

402690,COVID-19 and coinfection with Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile in an infant with gastrointestinal manifestation,2020,"BACKGROUND: Epilepsy, a chronic seizure disorder, can cause elevated fatigue and reduced quality of life (QOL) of the sufferers. Hence, improving QOL, seizure severity (SS) and fatigue are important areas of therapeutic interventions for people living with epilepsy (PLWE). Therefore, there is need to ascertain the levels and interrelationships among these constructs in PLWE. OBJECTIVE: This study compared fatigue and QOL of PLWE with those of apparently healthy individuals (AHIs) and also determined the interrelationships between fatigue, QOL and SS in PLWE. METHOD: This cross-sectional survey involved 91 PLWE and 101 AHIs consecutively recruited from purposively selected hospitals and hosting communities. The Short-form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire, the Fatigue Severity Scale, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale and the Seizure Severity Questionnaire were used to evaluate QOL, fatigue severity (FS), fatigue impact (FI) and SS respectively. Data was analyzed using frequency count, proportions, mean and standard deviation, range, Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman-rank order correlation. Alpha level was set at 0.05. RESULTS: PLWE had significantly lower QOL compared to AHIs (Uâ¯=â¯3057.00;pâ¯<â¯0.01). The two groups however experienced similar fatigue severity, but PWE suffered greater fatigue impact (Uâ¯=â¯2798.00;pâ¯<â¯0.01). Significant relationships existed among FI, FS, SS and QOL in PLWE (pâ¯<â¯0.01). CONCLUSION: Compared with AHIs, PLWE had poorer QOL, similar FS, and higher FI. QOL of PLWE was negatively associated with SS, FI and FS. Clinical interventions geared towards minimizing seizure, severity and impact of fatigue may improve the QOL of PLWE.","Akosile, Christopher Olusanjo; Anomneze, John Uche; Okoye, Emmanuel Chiebuka; Adegoke, Babatunde Olusola Adeleke; Uwakwe, Richard; Okeke, Emeka",Seizure,,585
402775,Interpretation of leisure sports in the pandemic situation of COVID 19,2020,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in increasing needs for mental health treatments and yet simultaneously posed great challenges to the delivery of in-person psychological services. The standard clinical practice suddenly shifted to the use of telepsychology. This study aimed to identify how therapists have been responding to the public health crisis and the rapid transition to telepsychology. We distributed a survey to 502 mental health providers to investigate the challenges and concerns of the delivery of clinical work during the pandemic. Our study found that most therapists (75.9%) transitioned to telepsychology without suspension of services. Therapists reported varied concerns regarding telepsychology, clinical practice, and their personal lives. The most common concerns identified were the use of therapeutic techniques in telepsychology, provision of remote services, and the practitioner's own health. Our findings also indicated that therapists who are students, female, sexual minorities, unpartnered, and working in public settings experienced relatively greater concerns. It may imperative to allocate more resources to those subgroups of therapists to facilitate their clinical work in telepsychology. This study contributed to our understanding of how the pandemic has impacted clinical work and may inform practitioners in coping with the current and any future public crises.","Lin, Tao; Stone, Suzannah J; Anderson, Timothy",Behav Med,,585

Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of mental health symptoms (anxiety, depression, and stress) in Bangladesh and the factors associated with these symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: From 1 to 30 April 2020, we used a validated self-administered questionnaire to conduct a cross-sectional study on 10,609 participants through an online survey platform. We assessed mental health status using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The total depression, anxiety, and stress subscale scores were divided into normal, mild, moderate, severe, and multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associated factors. Findings: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 15%, 34%, and 15% for mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms, respectively. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 59% for severe anxiety symptoms, 14% for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 14% for mild anxiety symptoms, while the prevalence for stress levels were 16% for severe stress level, 22% for moderate stress level, and 13% for mild stress level. Multivariate analyses revealed that the most consistent factors associated with mild, moderate, and severe of the three mental health subscales (depression, anxiety, and stress) were respondents who lived in Dhaka and Rangpur division, females, those who self-quarantined in the previous seven days before the survey, and those respondents who experienced chills, breathing difficulty, dizziness, and sore throat. Conclusion: Our results showed that about 64%, 87%, and 61% of the respondents in Bangladesh reported high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively.

The sample consisted of 4661 adults aged 30 years or above, and was chosen from the 2017 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data. Of all the subjects, 14.6% engaged in high-intensity DWPA and 6.25% in moderate-intensity DWPA; while 11.68% and 24.80% engaged in high- and moderate-intensity LTPA, respectively. The effects of both types of physical activities on the risk of diabetes were analyzed using a Bayesian ordered probit model. For those with high-intensity DWPA, the probability of the FBG level being normal was 5.10% (SE = 0.25) lower than for those with non-high-intensity DWPA, and the probabilities of IFG and diabetes were 3.30% (SE = 0.15) and 1.79% (SE = 0.09) higher, respectively. However, for those with high-intensity LTPA, the probability of the FBG level being normal was 2.54% (SE = 0.09) higher, and the probabilities of IFG and diabetes were 1.74% (SE = 0.07) and 0.80% (SE = 0.03) lower, respectively, than those with non-high-intensity LTPA. Likewise, for moderate-intensity DWPA and LTPA, the results were the same compared to low-intensity physical activities though the magnitude of the effects were smaller than for high-intensity. Thus, the activities related to work have a negative effect and those related to leisure have a positive effect. The criteria for physical activities to reduce the risk of diabetes should be set by separating these domains of physical activity, and new management strategies for diabetes are needed for people with moderate- or high-intensity DWPA.","Oh, Hyun Sook",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,585

405174,The great pause: a minor theory exploration of COVID-19 response in Switzerland,2020,"AIM: The aim of the study was to determine levels of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms and factors associated with psychological burden amongst critical care healthcare workers in the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS: An anonymous Web-based survey distributed in April 2020. All healthcare workers employed in a critical care setting were eligible to participate. Invitations to the survey were distributed through Australian and New Zealand critical care societies and social media platforms. The primary outcome was the proportion of healthcare workers who reported moderate to extremely severe scores on the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). RESULTS: Of the 3770 complete responses, 3039 (80.6%) were from Australia. A total of 2871 respondents (76.2%) were women; the median age was 41 years. Nurses made up 2269 (60.2%) of respondents, with most (2029 [53.8%]) working in intensive care units. Overall, 813 (21.6%) respondents reported moderate to extremely severe depression, 1078 (28.6%) reported moderate to extremely severe anxiety, and 1057 (28.0%) reported moderate to extremely severe stress scores. Mean ± standard deviation values of DASS-21 depression, anxiety, and stress scores amongst woman vs men was as follows: 8.0 ± 8.2 vs 7.1 ± 8.2 (p = 0.003), 7.2 ± 7.5 vs 5.0 ± 6.7 (p < 0.001), and 14.4 ± 9.6 vs 12.5 ± 9.4 (p < 0.001), respectively. After adjusting for significant confounders, clinical concerns associated with higher DASS-21 scores included not being clinically prepared (ß = 4.2, p < 0.001), an inadequate workforce (ß = 2.4, p = 0.001), having to triage patients owing to lack of beds and/or equipment (ß = 2.6, p = 0.001), virus transmission to friends and family (ß = 2.1, p = 0.009), contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (ß = 2.8, p = 0.011), being responsible for other staff members (ß = 3.1, p < 0.001), and being asked to work in an area that was not in the respondents' expertise (ß = 5.7, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this survey of critical care healthcare workers, between 22 and 29% of respondents reported moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, with women reporting higher scores than men. Although female gender appears to play a role, modifiable factors also contribute to psychological burden and should be studied further.","Hammond, Naomi E; Crowe, Liz; Abbenbroek, Brett; Elliott, Rosalind; Tian, David H; Donaldson, Lachlan H; Fitzgerald, Emily; Flower, Oliver; Grattan, Sarah; Harris, Roger; Sayers, Louise; Delaney, Anthony",Aust Crit Care,,585

405191,Adapting the al rajhi waqf model to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the ummah: A lesson to muslim philanthropists,2021,"BackgroundAttenuated immune responses to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been reported in solid organ transplant recipients. Most studies have assessed serological responses alone, and there is limited immunological data on vector-based vaccines in this population. This study compares the immunogenicity of BNT162b2 with ChAdOx1 in a cohort of kidney transplant patients, assessing both serological and cellular responses. Methods920 patients were screened for spike protein antibodies (anti-S) following 2 doses of either BNT162b2 (n=490) or ChAdOx1 (n=430). 106 patients underwent assessment with T-cell ELISpot assays. 65 health care workers were used as a control group. ResultsAnti-S was detected in 569 (61.8%) patients. Seroconversion rates in infection-naive patients who received BNT162b2 were higher compared with ChAdOx1, at 269/410 (65.6%) and 156/358 (43.6%) respectively, p<0.0001. Anti-S concentrations were higher following BNT162b, 58(7.1-722) BAU/ml, compared with ChAdOx1, 7.1(7.1-39) BAU/ml, p<0.0001. Calcineurin inhibitor monotherapy, vaccination occurring >1st year post-transplant and receiving BNT162b2 was associated with seroconversion. Only 28/106 (26.4%) of patients had detectable T-cell responses. There was no difference in detection between infection-naive patients who received BNT162b2, 7/40 (17.5%), versus ChAdOx1, 2/39 (5.1%), p=0.15. There was also no difference in patients with prior infection who received BNT162b2, 8/11 (72.7%), compared with ChAdOx1, 11/16 (68.8%), p=0.83. ConclusionsEnhanced humoral responses were seen with BNT162b2 compared with ChAdOx1 in kidney transplant patients. T-cell responses to both vaccines were markedly attenuated. Clinical efficacy data is still required but immunogenicity data suggests weakened responses to both vaccines in transplant patients, with ChAdOx1 less immunogenic compared with BNT162b2.","Prendecki, Maria; Thomson, Tina; Clarke, Candice L; Martin, Paul; Gleeson, Sarah; aguiar, Rute c De; Edwards, Helena; Mortimer, Paige; McIntyre, Stacey; Lewis, Shanice; Deborah, Jaid; Cox, Alison; Pickard, Graham; Lightstone, Liz; McAdoo, Stephen P; Kelleher, Peter; Willicombe, Michelle; Consortium, - OCTAVE Study",,,585

405921,Reallocating and Sharing Health Equipments in Sanitary Emergency Situations: The COVID-19 Case in Spain,2020-12-03,"BACKGROUND: Spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy forced health facilities to drastically change their organization to face the overwhelming number of infected patients needing hospitalization. The aim of this paper is to share with all the vascular community the protocol developed by the USL (Unità Sanitaria Locale) Toscana Centro for the reorganization of the Vascular Surgery Unit during the COVID-19 emergency, hoping to help other institutions to face the emergency during the hard weeks coming. METHODS: The USL Toscana Centro is a public Italian health care institution including four districts (Empoli, Florence, Pistoia, Prato) with 13 different hospitals, serving more than 1,500,000 people in a 5000 km2 area. The USL adopted a protocol of reorganization of the Vascular Surgery Unit during the first difficult weeks of the epidemic, consisting in the creation of a Vascular Hub for urgent cases, with a profound reorganization of activities, wards, surgical operators, operating blocks, and intensive care unit (ICU) beds. RESULTS: All 13 hospitals are now COVID-19 as the first days of April passed. The San Giovanni di Dio Hospital (Florence) has more than 80 COVID-19 patients in different settings (ICU, medical and surgical ward), which at the time of writing is almost one-third of the total hospital capacity (80/260 beds). It has been identified as the Surgical Hub for urgent vascular COVID-19 cases. Therefore, the elective surgical and office activities were reduced by 30% and 80%, respectively, and reserved to priority cases. A corner of the whole operating block, well separate from the remaining operating rooms, was rapidly converted into one operating room and six ICU beds dedicated to COVID patients. The COVID-19 surgical path now includes an emergency room for suspected COVID-19 patients directly connected to an elevator for the transfer of COVID patients in the COVID operating block and dedicated COVID-19 ward and ICU beds. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid modification of hospital settings, a certain ""flexibility"" of the medical personnel, a stepwise shutdown of vascular surgical and office activity, and the necessity of a strong leadership are mandatory to cope with the tsunami of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Chisci, Emiliano; Masciello, Fabrizio; Michelagnoli, Stefano",J Vasc Surg,,585

406118,Five Tips for Teaching and Learning During the COVID-19 Movement Control Order Era: A Family Medicine Perspective,2020,"These days, cyber-criminals target humans rather than machines since they try to accomplish their malicious intentions by exploiting the weaknesses of end users. Thus, human vulnerabilities pose a serious threat to the security and integrity of computer systems and data. The human tendency to trust and help others, as well as personal, social, and cultural characteristics, are indicative of the level of susceptibility that one may exhibit towards certain attack types and deception strategies. This work aims to investigate the factors that affect human susceptibility by studying the existing literature related to this subject. The objective is also to explore and describe state of the art human vulnerability assessment models, current prevention, and mitigation approaches regarding user susceptibility, as well as educational and awareness raising training strategies. Following the review of the literature, several conclusions are reached. Among them, Human Vulnerability Assessment has been included in various frameworks aiming to assess the cyber security capacity of organizations, but it concerns a one time assessment rather than a continuous practice. Moreover, human maliciousness is still neglected from current Human Vulnerability Assessment frameworks; thus, insider threat actors evade identification, which may lead to an increased cyber security risk. Finally, this work proposes a user susceptibility profile according to the factors stemming from our research.","Papatsaroucha, Dimitra; Nikoloudakis, Yannis; Kefaloukos, Ioannis; Pallis, Evangelos; Markakis, Evangelos K.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09986v2.pdf,585

407665,Life satisfaction during COVID-19,2020,"A pandemic poses particular challenges to decision-making with regard to the types of decisions and geographic levels ranging from regional and national to international. As decisions should be underpinned by evidence, several steps are necessary: First, data collection in terms of time dimension as well as representativity with respect to all necessary geographical levels is of particular importance. Aspects such as data quality, data availability and data relevance must be considered. These data can be used to develop statistical, mathematical and decision-analytical models enabling prediction and simulation of the consequences of interventions. We especially discuss the role of data in the different models. With respect to reporting, transparent communication to different stakeholders is crucial. This includes methodological aspects (e.g. the choice of model type and input parameters), the availability, quality and role of the data, the definition of relevant outcomes and tradeoffs and dealing with uncertainty. In order to understand the results, statistical literacy should be better considered. Especially the understanding of risks is necessary for the general public and health policy decision makers. Finally, the results of these predictions and decision analyses can be used to reach decisions about interventions, which in turn have an immediate influence on the further course of the pandemic. A central aim of this paper is to incorporate aspects from different research backgrounds and review the relevant literature in order to improve and foster interdisciplinary cooperation.","Jahn, Beate; Friedrich, Sarah; Behnke, Joachim; Engel, Joachim; Garczarek, Ursula; Munnich, Ralf; Pauly, Markus; Wilhelm, Adalbert; Wolkenhauer, Olaf; Zwick, Markus; Siebert, Uwe; Friede, Tim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.04068v1.pdf,585
407775,Evolving social contact patterns during the COVID-19 crisis in Luxembourg,2020,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that broke out in China in December 2019 rapidly became a worldwide pandemic. In Mexico, the conditions requiring the declaration of a sanitary emergency were reached by the last week of March 2020, and health authorities' limited mobility and imposed social isolation were the main strategies to keep the virus from spreading. Thus, daily living conditions changed drastically in a few days, generating a stressful situation characterized by an almost complete lack of mobility, social isolation, and forced full-time interactions with family members. Soon, complaints of sleep disturbances, anxiety, and symptoms of depression were reported. The present study reports the results of an online survey performed during the first two months of isolation. Questionnaires exploring sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression were sent to people who responded to an open invitation. A total of 1230 participants filled out the sleep questionnaire, 812 responded to the anxiety questionnaire, and 814 responded to the depression questionnaire. Both men and women reported poor sleep quality, but women showed a higher proportion (79%) than men (60%); young women were more likely to be affected by social isolation. Concerning anxiety and depression, both sexes reported high similar symptoms. These data suggest that stressful conditions related to social isolation and the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic may induce mental health disturbances, which may become worse with sleep restriction.","Terán-Pérez, Guadalupe; Portillo-Vásquez, Angelica; Arana-Lechuga, Yoaly; Sánchez-Escandón, Oscar; Mercadillo-Caballero, Roberto; González-Robles, Rosa Obdulia; Velázquez-Moctezuma, Javier",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,585

The literature is classified based on (i) type of population modelling (classical or network-based), (ii) frequency of the game (non-repeated or repeated), and (iii) type of strategy adoption (self-learning or imitation). The choice of model is shown to depend on many factors such as the immunity to the disease, the strength of immunity conferred by the vaccine, the size of population and the level of mixing therein. We highlight that while early studies used classical compartmental modelling with self-learning games, in recent years, there is a substantial growth of network-based modelling with imitation games. The review indicates that game theory continues to be an effective tool to model decision-making by individuals with respect to intervention (vaccination or social distancing).","Chang, Sheryl L; Piraveenan, Mahendra; Pattison, Philippa; Prokopenko, Mikhail",J Biol Dyn,,585

While the influx of energy-related infrastructure development investments to the region has improved the livelihoods of millions of people on the one hand, it has brought about a myriad of challenges to the wider region in guiding investments for quality infrastructure and for promoting a low-carbon economy, and energy access and affordability, on the other hand. Besides reviewing key regional initiatives for infrastructure investment and development, this paper examines energy demand and supply, and forecasts energy consumption in the subregion during 2017–2050 using energy modeling scenario analysis. The study found that to satisfy growing energy demand in the subregion, huge power generation infrastructure investment, estimated at around USD 190 billion–220 billion, is necessary between 2017 and 2050 and that such an investment will need to be guided by appropriate policy. We argue that without redesigning energy policy towards high-quality energy infrastructure, it is very likely that the increasing use of coal upon which the region greatly depends will lead to the widespread construction of coal-fired power plants, which could result in increased greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide emissions.","Han, Phoumin Meas Sopheak Hatda Pich An",Sustainability,,585

Individuals with minoritized sexual and gender identities are at a higher risk of experiencing such negative changes in their well-being. The objective of this study was to compare levels of well-being among cis-heterosexual individuals and individuals with minoritized sexual and gender identities during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using data obtained in a cross-sectional online survey between April 20 to July 20, 2020 (N = 2332), we compared levels of well-being (WHO-5) across subgroups (cis-individuals with minoritized sexual identities, individuals with minoritized gender identities and cis-heterosexual individuals) applying univariate (two-sample t-test) and multivariate analysis (multivariate linear regression). RESULTS: Results indicate overall lower levels of well-being as well as lower levels of well-being in minoritized sexual or gender identities compared to cis-heterosexual individuals. Further, multivariate analyses revealed that living in urban communities as well as being in a relationship were positively associated with higher levels of well-being. Furthermore, a moderation analysis showed that being in a relationship reduces the difference between groups in terms of well-being. CONCLUSION: Access to mental healthcare for individuals with minoritized sexual and gender identities as well as access to gender-affirming resources should be strengthened during COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare services with low barriers of access such as telehealth and online peer support groups should be made available, especially for vulnerable groups.","Buspavanich, Pichit; Lech, Sonia; Lermer, Eva; Fischer, Mirjam; Berger, Maximilian; Vilsmaier, Theresa; Kaltofen, Till; Keckstein, Simon; Mahner, Sven; Behr, Joachim; Thaler, Christian J; Batz, Falk",PLoS One,,585

409624,Changes to Training Practices during a Pandemic - The Experience of the Irish National Trauma & Orthopaedic Training Scheme,2020,"Background: This work aimed to identify the mathematical model and ecological pattern of COVID-19 infection and mortality across different countries during the first six months of the pandemic. Methodology: In this pilot study, authors used the online available data sources of randomly selected 18 countries to collect ecological predictors of COVID-19 transmissibility and mortality. The studied determinants were environmental factors (daily average temperature, daily humidity) and socioeconomic attributes (population age structure, count and density, human development index, per capita income (PCI), gross domestic product, internet coverage, mobility trends, chronic diseases). Researchers used the linear and exponential time series analysis, and further utilize multivariate techniques to explain the variance in the monthly exponential growth rates of new cases and deaths. Result: In the first two months, the R2 of linear models for the cases and deaths were higher than that of the corresponding R2 of the exponential model. Later one, R2 of the exponential model was occasionally relatively higher than that of the linear models. The exponential growth rate of new cases was significantly associated with mobility trends (ß=0.00398, P=0.002), temperature (ß=0.000679, P=0.011), humidity (ß=0.000249, P=0.000), and the proportion of patients aged above 65 years (ß=-0.000959, P=0.012). Similarly, the exponential growth rate of deaths was significantly associated with mobility trends (ß=0.0027, P=0.049), temperature (ß=0.0014, P<0.001), humidity (ß=-0.0026, P=0.000), and PCI of countries. During this period, COVID-19 transmissibility was evident to be controlled as soon as social mobility is decreased by about 40% of the baseline over 3 months controlling for the other predictors. Conclusion: Controlling of COVID-19 pandemic is based mainly on controlling social mobility. Role of environmental determinants like temperature and humidity was well noticed on disease fatality and transmissibility. COVID-19 contagiousness and fatality were additionally affected by human modifiable risk factors like income and non-modifiable risk factors (ageing) affected.","Asem, Noha; Ramadan, Ahmed; Hassany, Mohamed; Ghazy, Ramy Mohamed; Abdallah, Mohamed; Gamal, Eman M; Hassan, Shaimaa; Kamal, Nehal; Ibrahim, Mohamed; Zaid, Hala",Heliyon,,585

Although several drugs have been announced to be partially effective treatments for this disease, no approved vaccine is available. Here, we described the construction of a recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum strain expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The results showed that the spike gene with optimized codons could be efficiently expressed on the surface of recombinant L. plantarum and exhibited high antigenicity. The highest protein yield was obtained under the following conditions: cells were induced with 50 ng/mL SppIP at 37 °C for 6-10 h. The recombinant spike (S) protein was stable under normal conditions and at 50 °C, pH = 1.5, or a high salt concentration. Recombinant L. plantarum may provide a promising food-grade oral vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Wang, Maopeng; Fu, Tingting; Hao, Jiayi; Li, Letian; Tian, Mingyao; Jin, Ningyi; Ren, Linzhu; Li, Chang",Int J Biol Macromol,,585

The optimal type and duration of prophylactic antithrombotic therapy in these patients remain unknown. METHODS: This manuscript reports the final (90-day) results of the Intermediate versus Standard-dose Prophylactic anticoagulation In cRitically-ill pATIents with COVID-19: An opeN label randomized controlled trial (INSPIRATION) study. Patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care were randomized to intermediate-dose versus standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation for 30 days, irrespective of hospital discharge status. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of adjudicated venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or all-cause death. The main safety outcome was major bleeding. RESULTS: Of 600 randomized patients, 562 entered the modified intention-to-treat analysis (median age [Q1, Q3]; 62 (50, 71) years; 237 (42.2%) women), of whom 336 (59.8%) survived to hospital discharge. The primary outcome occurred in 132 (47.8%) of patients assigned to intermediate-dose and 130 (45.4%) patients assigned to standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.95-1.55, P=0.11). No significant differences were observed between the two groups for other efficacy outcomes, or in the landmark analysis from days 31-90. Overall, there were 7 (2.5%) major bleeding events in the intermediate-dose group (including 3 fatal events) and 4 (1.4%) major bleeding events in the standard-dose group (none fatal) (HR: 1.82, 95% CI: 0.53-6.24, P=0.33). CONCLUSION: Intermediate-dose compared with standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation did not reduce a composite of death, treatment with ECMO, or venous or arterial thrombosis at 90-day follow-up.","Bikdeli, Behnood; Talasaz, Azita H; Rashidi, Farid; Bakhshandeh, Hooman; Rafiee, Farnaz; Matin, Samira; Baghizadeh, Elahe; Rezaeifar, Parisa; Jamalkhani, Sepehr; Tahamtan, Ooria; Sharif-Kashani, Babak; Beigmohammadi, Mohammad Taghi; Farrokhpour, Mohsen; Sezavar, Seyed Hashem; Payandemehr, Pooya; Dabbagh, Ali; Gohari Moghadam, Keivan; Khalili, Hossein; Yadollahzadeh, Mahdi; Riahi, Taghi; Abedini, Atefeh; Lookzadeh, Somayeh; Rahmani, Hamid; Zoghi, Elnaz; Mohammadi, Keyhan; Sadeghipour, Pardis; Abri, Homa; Tabrizi, Sanaz; Mousavian, Seyed Masoud; Shahmirzaei, Shaghayegh; Amin, Ahmad; Mohebbi, Bahram; Parhizgar, Seyed Ehsan; Aliannejad, Rasoul; Eslami, Vahid; Kashefizadeh, Alireza; Dobesh, Paul; Kakavand, Hessam; Hosseini, Seyed Hossein; Shafaghi, Shadi; Fattah Ghazi, Samrand; Najafi, Atabak; Jiménez, David; Gupta, Aakriti; Madhavan, Mahesh V; Sethi, Sanjum; Parikh, Sahil A; Monreal, Manuel; Hadavand, Naser; Hajighasemi, Alireza",Thromb. haemost,,585
410784,Immunizing Markets against the Pandemic: COVID–19 Vaccinations and Stock Volatility around the World (preprint),2021,"BACKGROUND: As of April 18, 2020, over 2,000,000 patients had been diagnosed with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) globally, and more than 140,000 deaths had been reported. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult patients have been documented recently. However, information on pediatric patients is limited. We describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of pediatric patients to provide valuable insight into the early diagnosis and assessment of COVID-19 in children. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This retrospective, observational study involves a case series performed at 4 hospitals in West China. Thirty-four pediatric patients with COVID-19 were included from January 27 to February 23, 2020. The final follow-up visit was completed by March 16, 2020. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were analyzed on the basis of demographic data, medical history, laboratory tests, radiological findings, and treatment information. Data analysis was performed for 34 pediatrics patients with COVID-19 aged from 1 to 144 months (median 33.00, interquartile range 10.00-94.25), among whom 14 males (41%) were included. All the patients in the current study presented mild (18%) or moderate (82%) forms of COVID-19. A total of 48% of patients were noted to be without a history of exposure to an identified source. Mixed infections of other respiratory pathogens were reported in 16 patients (47%). Comorbidities were reported in 6 patients (18%). The most common initial symptoms were fever (76%) and cough (62%). Expectoration (21%), vomiting (12%), and diarrhea (12%) were also reported in a considerable portion of cases. A substantial increase was detected in serum amyloid A for 17 patients (among 20 patients with available data; 85%) and in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein for 17 patients (among 29 patients with available data; 59%), whereas a decrease in prealbumin was noticed in 25 patients (among 32 patients with available data; 78%). In addition, significant increases in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase and &#945;-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase were detected in 28 patients (among 34 patients with available data; 82%) and 25 patients (among 34 patients with available data; 74%), respectively. Patchy lesions in lobules were detected by chest computed tomographic scans in 28 patients (82%). Ground-glass opacities, which were a typical feature in adults, were rare in pediatric patients (3%). Rapid radiologic progression and a late-onset pattern of lesions in the lobules were also noticed. Lesions in lobules still existed in 24 (among 32 patients with lesions; 75%) patients that were discharged, although the main symptoms disappeared a few days after treatment. All patients were discharged, and the median duration of hospitalization was 10.00 (8.00-14.25) days. The current study was limited by the small sample size and a lack of dynamic detection of inflammatory markers. CONCLUSIONS: Our data systemically presented the clinical and epidemiological features, as well as the outcomes, of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Stratified analysis was performed between mild and moderate cases. The findings offer new insight into early identification and intervention in pediatric patients with COVID-19.","Zhang, Che; Gu, Jiaowei; Chen, Quanjing; Deng, Na; Li, Jingfeng; Huang, Li; Zhou, Xihui",PLoS Med,,585

These policies should be inclusive in terms of financial gains. Using the panel data of 30 regions in China from 2006 to 2016, this paper uses the Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimator to analyze the impact of inclusive finance on public health. The results show that inclusive finance has a significant positive effect on public health. The performance of the eastern region is significantly better than that of the central and western regions. When we consider the combined effect of environmental regulation, the improvement effect of inclusive finance on public health is still significant, and the coefficient increases in the eastern region. Similarly, there is also a significant improvement effect in the central and western regions. Our findings reveal that environmental regulation promotes the beneficial effect of inclusive finance. Therefore, it is important to improve the inclusive financial development mechanism and enhance environmental regulation intensity for solving public health issues.

Here, we predict structure and dynamics of five RNA stem loops in the 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 by extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, more than 0.5 ms of aggregate simulation time, in combination with enhanced sampling techniques. We compare simulations with available experimental data, describe the resulting conformational ensembles, and identify the presence of specific structural rearrangements in apical and internal loops that may be functionally relevant. Our atomic-detailed structural predictions reveal a rich dynamics in these RNA molecules, could help the experimental characterization of these systems, and provide putative three-dimensional models for structure-based drug design studies.","Bottaro, Sandro; Bussi, Giovanni; Lindorff-Larsen, Kresten",j. am. chem. soc,,585

411594,COVID-19 Stigma Induced by Local Government and Media Reporting in Japan: It's Time to Reconsider Risk Communication Lessons From the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster,2020,"Wake-related ketamine-dependent high frequency oscillations (HFO) can be recorded in local field potentials (LFP) from cortical and subcortical regions in rodents. The mechanisms underlying their generation and occurrence in higher mammals are unclear. Unfortunately, anesthetic doses of pure ketamine attenuate HFO, which has precluded their investigation under anesthesia. Here, we show ketamine-xylazine (KX) anesthesia is associated with a prominent 80-130 Hz rhythm in the olfactory bulb (OB) of rats, whereas 30-65 Hz gamma power is diminished. Simultaneous LFP and thermocouple recordings revealed the 80-130 Hz rhythm was dependent on nasal respiration. This rhythm persisted despite surgical excision of the piriform cortex. Silicon probes spanning the dorsoventral aspect of the OB revealed this rhythm was strongest in ventral areas and associated with microcurrent sources about the mitral layer. Pharmacological microinfusion studies revealed dependency on excitatory-inhibitory synaptic activity, but not gap junctions. Finally, a similar rhythm occurred in the OB of KX-anesthetized cats, which shared key features with our rodent studies. We conclude that the activity we report here is driven by nasal airflow, local excitatory-inhibitory interactions, and conserved in higher mammals. Additionally, KX anesthesia is a convenient model to investigate further the mechanisms underlying wake-related ketamine-dependent HFO.","Sredniawa, Wladyslaw; Wróbel, Jacek; Kublik, Ewa; Wójcik, Daniel Krzysztof; Whittington, Miles Adrian; Hunt, Mark Jeremy",Sci Rep,,585

Because of its generalizability, the MV design has been widely adopted by the visualization community to help users examine and interact with large, complex, and high-dimensional data. However, although ubiquitous, there has been little work to categorize and analyze MVs in order to better understand its design space. As a result, there has been little to no guideline in how to use the MV design effectively. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of how MVs are designed in practice. We focus on two fundamental measures of multiple-view patterns: composition, which quantifies what view types and how many are there; and configuration, which characterizes spatial arrangement of view layouts in the display space. We build a new dataset containing 360 images of MVs collected from IEEE VIS, EuroVis, and PacificVis publications 2011 to 2019, and make fine-grained annotations of view types and layouts for these visualization images. From this data we conduct composition and configuration analyses using quantitative metrics of term frequency and layout topology. We identify common practices around MVs, including relationship of view types, popular view layouts, and correlation between view types and layouts. We combine the findings into a MV recommendation system, providing interactive tools to explore the design space, and support example-based design.","Chen, Xi; Zeng, Wei; Lin, Yanna; Al-maneea, Hayder Mahdi; Roberts, Jonathan; Chang, Remco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15407v2.pdf,585

The Zn porphyrin dyad showed a high turnover number for CO production compared with the free-base porphyrin dyad, suggesting that the central Zn ion of porphyrin plays an important role in suppressing electron accumulation on the porphyrin part and achieving high durability of the photocatalytic CO 2 reduction using both TEA and BIH. The effect of acids on the CO 2 reduction was investigated using the Zn porphyrin-Re dyad and BIH.

Lockdown restrictions, compromised access to medical care and fear of potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 have forced patients with non-COVID-19 illnesses such as type 1 diabetes (T1D) to stay home. Thisâ¯situation can lead to delay in T1D diagnosis and insulin treatmentâ¯resultingâ¯in rapid progression to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and therefore increased risk of complications and death.â¯â¯. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency and severity of DKA at the onset of T1D in children diagnosed in our department during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown from March 2020 till May 2020 in comparison to corresponding period of the previous year.â¯. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We collected data ofâ¯children with newly diagnosed T1D. DKA was defined according to ISPAD guidelines.â¯. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 34 childrenâ¯in groupâ¯2020â¯and 52 in groupâ¯2019 with an average age 9.90 ±4.9 vs. 9.59±4.7 years with mean HbA1c 12.9 ±2.4â¯vs.â¯11.5 ±2.2%,â¯respectively. The incidence of DKA was higher by 12% inâ¯groupâ¯2020 vs.â¯2019 (52.94% vs 40.38%; p = 0.276).â¯ Regarding the DKA severity (2020 vs. 2019)â¯32.35% vs. 11.54% wereâ¯severe (p = 0.026), 17.65 vs. 13% were moderate (p = 0.759), and 2.94 vs. 15.38%â¯wereâ¯mild (p = 0.081).â¯None of the analyzed patients were COVID-19 positive. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown changes in society and health care system, the DKA rate has increased by 12 percentage points with more severe cases noted in children with newly diagnosedâ¯T1D. Regular education of the whole society about the symptoms of diabetes could contribute to faster diagnosis of T1D and reduction of DKA prevalence.â¯.","Dzygalo, Katarzyna; Nowaczyk, Jedrzej; Szwilling, Alicja; Kowalska, Agnieszka",Pediatr Endocrinol Diabetes Metab,,585
413457,Assessing teachers’ perspectives on giving music lessons remotely during the COVID-19 lockdown period,2021,"The effect of HIV infection on COVID-19 outcomes remains an urgent question in sub-Saharan Africa, where many countries are experiencing dual HIV and COVID-19 epidemics, and capacity to treat severe COVID-19 is limited. Using data from patients with probable or confirmed COVID-19 admitted to specialized treatment centers during March-December 2020 in Zambia, the Zambian Ministry of Health and CDC assessed the relationship between HIV infection and severe COVID-19 and COVID-19-associated death. Among 443 patients included in the study, 122 (28%) were HIV-positive, and of these, 91 (89%) were receiving ART at the time of hospitalization. HIV status alone was not significantly associated with severe COVID-19 at admission or during hospitalization or with COVID-19-associated death. However, among HIV-positive persons, those with severe HIV disease were more likely to develop severe COVID-19 and were at increased risk for COVID-19-associated death. Ensuring that persons maintain HIV disease control, including maintaining ART continuity and adherence, achieving viral suppression, and addressing and managing underlying medical conditions, could help reduce COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.","Chanda, D.; Minchella, P.

The effect of facecovers on the gaze when looking at faces has not been assessed yet. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to investigate a potential difference in eye movement pattern in observes which are exposed to images showing a face without and with facecover to identify if there is truly a change of gaze when identifying (masked) facial features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The eye movement of a total of 64 study participants (28 males and 36 females) with a mean age of 31.84±9.0 years was analyzed in this cross-sectional observational study. Eye movement analysis was conducted based on positional changes of eye features within an x- and y- coordinate system while two images (face without/with facecover) were displayed for 8 seconds. RESULTS: The results of this study revealed that the sequence of focussing on facial regions was not altered when wearing a facecover and followed the sequence: perioral, nose, periorbital. Wearing a facecover significantly increased the time of focussing on the periorbital region and increased also the number of repeated eye fixations during the interval of visual stimulus presentation. No statistically significant differences were observed between male and female participants in their eye movement pattern across all investigated variables with p > 0.433. CONCLUSION: Aesthetic practitioners could utilized the presented data and develop marketing and treatment strategies which majorly target the periorbital area understanding the altered eye movement pattern in times of COVID-19.","Frank, Konstantin; Schuster, Luca; Alfertshofer, Michael; Baumbach, Sebastian Felix; Herterich, Viktoria; Giunta, Riccardo E; Moellhoff, Nicholas; Braig, David; Ehrl, Denis; Cotofana, Sebastian",Aesthet. surg. j,,585

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of addition of TOC to standard of care (SOC) versus SOC in patients with COVID-19. We performed a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, WHO COVID, LitCOVID, and Cochrane databases. Pooled outcomes (overall mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, and secondary infections) were compared using DerSimonian-Laird/Random-effects approach. Risk difference (RD), confidence interval (CI), and p values were generated. A total of 23 studies with 6279 patients (1897 in TOC and 4382 in SOC group, respectively) were included. The overall mortality was lower in TOC group compared to SOC group (RD: -0.06; CI: -0.12 to -0.01; p = .03). Subgroup analysis including studies with only severe cases revealed lower mortality (RD: -0.12; CI: -0.18 to -0.06; p < .01) and need for mechanical ventilation (RD: -0.11; CI: -0.19 to -0.02; p = .01) in TOC group compared to SOC group. The addition of TOC to SOC has the potential to reduce mortality and need for mechanical ventilation in patients with severe COVID-19. Randomized controlled trials are needed to validate this.","Aziz, Muhammad; Haghbin, Hossein; Abu Sitta, Emad; Nawras, Yusuf; Fatima, Rawish; Sharma, Sachit; Lee-Smith, Wade; Duggan, Joan; Kammeyer, Joel A; Hanrahan, Jennifer; Assaly, Ragheb",J. med. virol,,585

At these temperatures, RA of NaCl through non-adiabatic dynamics is important. A scattering program has been implemented to carry out calculations of RA cross sections, accounting for coupled dynamics on the lowest ionic and the lowest neutral diabatic 1&#931;+ states. The study shows that the non-adiabatic treatment gives a cross section that exceeds that of conventional adiabatic dynamics by one to four orders of magnitude. The contribution to the RA rate constant from Na and Cl approaching each other in the A1&#928; state has also been computed using an established quantum mechanical method.

414611,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Urology Residency Program in Singapore",2020,"In the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic, medical experts (virologists, epidemiologists, public health scholars, and statisticians alike) have become instrumental in suggesting policies to counteract the spread of coronavirus. Given the dangerousness and the extent of the contagion, almost no one has questioned the suggestions that these experts have advised policymakers to implement. Quite often the latter explicitly sought experts' advice and justified unpopular measures (e.g., restricting people's freedom of movement) by referring to the epistemic authority attributed to experts. The main goal of this paper is to analyze the basis of this epistemic authority and the reasons why in this case it has not been challenged, contrary to the widespread tendency to devalue expertise that has been observed in recent years. In addition, in relation to the fact that experts' recommendations are generally technical and supposedly neutral, we note that in the COVID-19 crisis different experts have suggested different public health policies. We consider the British case of herd immunity and the US case of the exclusion of disabled people from medical care. These decisions have strong axiological implications and affect people profoundly in very sensitive domains. Another goal is, therefore, to argue that in such cases experts should justify their recommendations-which effectively become obligations-by the canons of public reason within the political process because when values are involved it is no longer just a matter of finding the “best technical solution,” but also of making discretionary choices that affect citizens and that cannot be imposed solely on the basis of epistemic authority.","Lavazza, Andrea; Farina, Mirko",Front.

Methods: Forty-five COVID-19 patients positive for real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab with or without ocular manifestations were included in the study. The conjunctival swab of each patient was collected by an ophthalmologist posted for COVID duty. Results: Out of 45 patients, 35 (77.77%) were males and the rest were females. The mean age was 31.26 ± 12.81 years. None of the patients had any ocular manifestations. One (2.23%) out of 45 patients was positive for RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctival swab. Conclusion: This study shows that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in conjunctival swabs of confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients.

The principle working enzymes of SARS CoV-2 have been identified as main proteases 3Cl pro which act as main regulators for SARS infection. The need for therapy is required immediately pertaining to the vulnerable conditions. Protein-ligand studies are imperative for understanding the functioning of biological interactions as they are crucial in providing a hypothetical origin for the design and unearthing of novel drug targets. Phytoconstituents from Glycyrrhiza glabra, earlier reported to be anticancerous in nature were used as repurposed drugs against SARS CoV-2 main protease 3Clpro. We analyzed the molecular interactions of protein-phytocompounds, by AutoDock Vina 4.2 tools. The best interactions of each algorithm were subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to have an insight of the molecular dynamic mechanisms involved. Selected phytoconstituents gave a good score for binding affinity with the main protease 6LU7 of SARS CoV-2 as compared to the antiviral drugs already being used in the disease therapy.

Neste contexto, o diagnóstico de bem-estar de cabras de corte e de leite é importante para a identificação dos problemas de saúde e comportamentais que afetam os animais, juntamente com as deficiências presentes nas instalações. O objetivo deste estudo foi diagnosticar o bem-estar de cabras de corte e de leite no Ceará, Brasil. Este estudo foi dividido em cinco capítulos: (1) Apresentação; (2) Proposta de indicadores para avaliação do bem-estar em cabras de corte em fazendas na região do semiárido do Nordeste Brasileiro: uma revisão; (3) Avaliação de bem-estar na fazenda em cabras de corte criadas em sistema semi-intensivo e extensivo no Ceará, Brasil; (4) Avaliação de bem-estar na fazenda em cabras de leite no Ceará, Brasil; (5) Considerações finais. O capítulo 2 teve como objetivo selecionar indicadores baseados no animal e nos recursos para diagnosticar o bem-estar de cabras de corte, além de utilizar esses parâmetros de acordo com o sistema de produção: extensivo, semi-intensivo ou intensivo. Dezoito indicadores foram selecionados para serem aplicados em cabras de corte. O capítulo 3 teve como objetivo desenvolver um protocolo de bem-estar para ser aplicado em cabras de corte, criadas para corte ou genética, em fazendas de sistema extensivo (E) ou semi-intensivo (S). Quinze fazendas foram avaliadas na região Metropolitana de Fortaleza e de Quixadá, no Ceará, Brasil. A nível de grupos, os indicadores abscessos e estresse térmico, baseados nos animais, e os indicadores tipo de bebedouros e acesso a abrigos diferiram significativamente (p<0,05) em ambos os sistemas de produção. A nível individual, os indicadores abscessos, corrimento ocular e lesões na orelha diferiram significativamente (p<0,05) entre os sistemas. Os resultados mostraram que ambos os sistemas enfrentam problemas similares devido ao estresse térmico, falta de forragem, e problemas de saúde, embora os animais das fazendas S estavam em melhores condições. O capítulo 4 teve como objetivo aplicar o protocolo AWIN Goats para avaliar e comparar o bem-estar de cabras adultas em fazendas com cabras em lactação (L) e não-lactação (NL) no Ceará, Brasil. Treze fazendas foram avaliadas na região Metropolitana de Fortaleza e de Quixadá, e na região leste do Ceará. No primeiro nível de bem-estar, apenas o estresse térmico mostrou diferença significativa (p<0,05) entre L e NL. No segundo nível de bem-estar, a nível individual, houve diferença significava (p<0,05) quanto aos indicadores abscessos e sobrecrescimento das unhas entre L e NL. Os resultados mostraram que ambos os grupos estavam submetidos aos mesmos problemas de bem-estar, sendo importante implementar medidas para melhorar a qualidade de vida das cabras de leite em fazendas no Ceará. Espera-se que os resultados encontrados esclareçam os produtores e tratadores quanto a importância do bem-estar animal, e os estimulem a promover mudanças de manejo e nas instalações, visando melhorar a qualidade de vida destes animais.","LEITE, LUANA OLIVEIRA",,,585

The UK government reacted to this with a three-pronged approach of importing, up-scaling existing production and supporting new design projects. The latter two parts ? labelled the UK Ventilator Challenge ? included over 50 companies from various sectors including the automotive and aerospace industries. Nine multi-partner consortia and five single-company projects were initiated with varying approaches. This study explores lessons learned during the setup and management of these medical device designs and manufacturing consortia. A qualitative survey methodology was employed, and 32 semi-structured stakeholder interviews were conducted. The primary data was triangulated through the collection of 42 secondary data sources such as webinars and radio interviews. Transcription and a three-step data analysis process of thematic coding identified six lessons learned. The analysis of the data showed that a strong, appealing common goal can enable employee motivation and trust as well as align priorities across all companies involved. This facilitates the involvement and fruitful collaboration of companies with varying sizes and fields of expertise. Furthermore, selecting the most suitable employees with specialist knowledge for high-priority projects and empowering them to make decisions can have a positive effect on project performance. The findings from the study complement existing literature on new product development and crisis management processes. In addition, the results uncover potential long-term effects such as more openness for cross-sector collaborations, which can serve as interesting sources for further research.","von Behr, Carl-Magnus Semple Georgia Anne Minshall Tim",R&amp;D Management,,585

Committees were formed to support healthcare professionals and to operationalise, interpret and compensate for gaps in national and professional guidance. But as the role of clinical ethics support becomes more prominent and visible, it becomes ever more important to address gaps in the support structure and misconceptions as to role and remit. The recent case of Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust v MX, FX and X ([2020] EWHC 1958 (Fam), [21]-[23] and [58]) has highlighted the importance of patient/family representation at clinical ethics committee meetings. The court viewed these meetings as making decisions about such treatment. We argue that this misunderstands the role of ethics support, with treatment decisions remaining with the clinical team and those providing their consent. The considered review by clinical ethics committees of the moral issues surrounding complex treatment decisions is not a matter of determining a single ethical course of action. In this article, we consider current legal understandings of clinical ethics committees, explore current concepts of ethics support and suggest how they may evolve, considering the various mechanisms of the inclusion of patients and their representatives in ethics meetings which is not standard in the UK.","Brierley, Joe; Archard, David; Cave, Emma",J Med Ethics,,585

416185,COVID-19 Public Sentiment Evaluation Through Twitter (preprint),2021,"Low-frequency sound from large vessels is a major, global source of ocean noise that can interfere with acoustic communication in a variety of marine animals. Changes in vessel activity provide opportunities to quantify relationships between vessel traffic levels and soundscape conditions in biologically important habitats. Using continuous deep-sea (890 m) recordings acquired ~20 km from offshore shipping lanes, we observed a quieting of low-frequency noise within Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (California, USA) associated with changes in vessel traffic during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The frequency band 31–100 Hz effectively captured large-vessel noise while minimizing potential biases from geological and biological sources. Monthly median spectrum levels (MSL) in this band decreased during January–June 2020, as much as 2.7 dB re 1 uPa2 Hz-1 below levels in the prior two years, and they began returning to those levels by July 2020. During 2020 MSL were strongly correlated with large-vessel total gross tonnage derived from economic data, summed across all California ports (r = 0.89, p &lt; 0.01). They were also highly correlated with regional presence of large vessels, quantified from Automatic Identification System (AIS) line-of-sight vessel tracking data and weighted by vessel speed and inverse distance from the recorder (r = 0.94, p &lt; 0.01). Within the three-year study period, February–June 2020 exhibited anomalously quiet low-frequency noise and anomalously low statewide port activity and regional large-vessel presence. While likely a short-term change, the maximum 2020 quieting represented nearly a halving of acoustic intensity in a frequency band used by baleen whales to communicate. This illustrates the influence of offshore large-vessel traffic on sound and protected species in marine sanctuary habitats.","Ryan, John P.; Joseph, John E.; Margolina, Tetyana Hatch Leila T.; Azzara, Alyson Reyes Alexis Southall Brandon L.; DeVogelaere, Andrew Peavey Reeves Lindsey E.; Zhang, Yanwu Cline Danelle E.; Jones, Brent McGill Paul Baumann-Pickering Simone Stimpert Alison K.",Frontiers in Marine Science,,585

The factor associated with mortality in patients with RID was advanced age (OR [95% CI], 1.1 [1.0-1.2]; p = 0.025), while the factors associated with hospitalization were advanced age (OR [95% CI], 1.1 [1.0-1.1]; p = 0.007) and hypertension (OR [95% CI], 3.9 [1.5-6.7]; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Mortality and hospital admission due to COVID-19 do not seem to increase in RID. Advanced age was associated with mortality in RID and, in addition, HTN was associated with hospital admission.","Mena-Vázquez, Natalia; Manrique Arija, Sara; Rojas-Giménez, Marta; Raya-Álvarez, Enrique; Velloso-Feijoó, María Luisa; López-Medina, C; Ramos-Giraldez, Consuelo; Godoy-Navarrete, Francisco Javier; Redondo-Rodríguez, Rocío; Cabezas-Lucena, Alba María; Morales-Águila, M; Romero-Barco, C M; Fernández-Nebro, Antonio",Reumatol. clin.

418252,COVID-19: A Review of the Available Evidence Regarding Pediatric Population/ COVID-19: una revisión de la evidencia en el ámbito pediátrico,2020,"The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 remains poorly understood. Theory predicts a group-structured population with selection acting principally at two levels: the pathogen individuals and the group of pathogens within a single host individual. Rapid replication of individual viruses is selected for, but if this replication debilitates the host before transmission occurs, the entire group of viruses in that host may perish. Thus, rapid transmission can favor more pathogenic strains, while slower transmission can favor less pathogenic strains. Available data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may follow this pattern. Indeed, high population density and other circumstances that favor rapid transmission may also favor more deadly strains. Health care workers, exposed to pathogenic strains of hospitalized patients, may be at greater risk. The low case fatality rate on the Diamond Princess cruise ship may reflect the founder effect-an initial infection with a mild strain. A vaccine made with one strain may confer limited immunity to other strains. Variation among strains may lead to the rapid evolution of resistance to therapeutics. Finally, if less pathogenic strains are largely associated with mild disease, rather than treating all SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals equally, priority could be focused on testing and contact tracing the most seriously symptomatic patients.","Blackstone, Neil W; Blackstone, Sarah R; Berg, Anne T",,,585
418426,When pandemics clash: Gendered violence-related traumatic brain injuries in women since COVID-19,2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to unprecedented changes in the way we live, particularly for people at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. People with pre-existing health conditions have been markedly impacted and, in some instances, left unsupported due to reduced provision of routine healthcare services. People living with obesity (PLWO) are identified as at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 infection. Currently, there is a paucity of evidence about the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown on PLWO, including those accessing weight management and bariatric surgery services (WMS). Methods: 543 adults (16-80 years) with obesity (BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2) were recruited between 14th May and 9th July 2020 through social media advertisements, professional and patient obesity organisations and WMS. Participants completed an online survey regarding the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown upon, mental health, well-being, health-related behaviours, risk mitigating behaviours, access to WMS and weight stigma. Findings: During the first COVID-19 lockdown, the majority of PLWO reported deterioration of their mental health and health-related behaviours such as diet, physical activity (PA) and sleep. With 55% reporting an unhealthier diet, 61% reduced PA and 80% worsening of their sleep. Higher depression and lower wellbeing scores were found to associate with the greatest adverse impact upon health-related behaviours. PLWO who were attending WMS prior to the first lockdown reported a greater deterioration of their diet, with nearly 50% reporting worsening of their diet and PA worsening compared to PLWO who were not attending WMS. Most participants took two or more risk mitigating actions (73%). PLWO attending WMS reported reduced access (44%) with insufficient information (49%) from their clinical service providers. The majority of participants reported no change in perceived weight stigma. Interpretation: This study shows the detrimental impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown on PLWO in relation to health-related behaviours, mental health and access to WMS. Our findings show that PLWO with poor mental health and those attending WMS were most adversely impacted and highlights the need for greater mental health support and continued provision of support from WMS for PLWO during future lockdowns. Funding: This research was funded through National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre funding.","Brown, Adrian; Flint, Stuart W; Kalea, Anastasia Z; O039,; Kane, Mary; Williams, Simon; Batterham, Rachel L",EClinicalMedicine,,585

A life-saving vaccine is available, but sensitivity to vaccines is generally lower in dialysis patients. Little is yet known about antibody responses after COVID-19 vaccination in this vulnerable group. Design, setting, participants, and measurements In this prospective single-center study, we included 22 dialysis patients and 46 healthy controls from Heidelberg University Hospital between December 2020 and February 2021. We measured anti-S1 IgG with a threshold index for detection >1, neutralizing antibodies with a threshold for viral neutralization of &#8805;30% and antibodies against different SARS-CoV-2 fragments 17-22 days after the first and 18-22 days after the second dose of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2. Results After the first vaccine dose, 4/22 (18%) dialysis patients compared with 43/46 (93%) healthy controls developed positive anti-S1 IgG, with a median (IQR) anti-S1 IgG index of 0.2 (0.1-0.7) compared with 9 (4-16), respectively. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies exceeded the threshold for neutralization in 4/22 (18%) dialysis patients compared with 43/46 (93%) in healthy controls, with a median (IQR) percent inhibition of 11 (3-24) compared with 65 (49-75), respectively. After the second dose, 14/17 (82%) of dialysis patients developed neutralizing antibodies exceeding the threshold for viral neutralization and antibodies against the receptor-binding S1-domain of the spike protein, compared to 46/46 (100%) of healthy controls, respectively.

Public health efforts to control the pandemic may alter health behaviors related to weight gain, inflammation, and poor cardiometabolic health, exacerbating the prevalence of obesity, poor immune health, and chronic diseases. DESIGN: We reviewed how the pandemic adversely influences many of these behaviors, specifically physical activity, sedentary behaviors, sleep, and dietary intakes, and provided individual level strategies that may be used to mitigate them. RESULTS: At the community level and higher, public health and health care professionals need to advocate for intervention strategies and policy changes that address these behaviors, such as increasing nutrition assistance programs and creating designated areas for recreation and active transportation, to reduce disparities among vulnerable populations. CONCLUSIONS: The long-lasting impact of the pandemic on health behaviors, and the possibility of a second COVID-19 wave, emphasize the need for creative and evolving, multi-level approaches to assist individuals in adapting their health behaviors to prevent both chronic and infectious diseases.","Parekh, Niyati; Deierlein, Andrea L",Public Health Nutr,,585

This study aims to determine the underlying mechanisms of corticosteroid treatment for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation and ALI. We used corticosteroid treatment for LPS-induced murine ALI model to investigate the effect of corticosteroid on ALI in vivo. Moreover, LPS-stimulated macrophages were used to explore the specific anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids on NLRP3-inflammasome in vitro. We found corticosteroids attenuated LPS-induced ALI, which manifested in reduction of the alveolar structure destruction, the infiltration of neutrophils and the inflammatory cytokines release of interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) in Lung. In vitro, when NLRP3-inflammasome was knocked out, inflammatory response of caspase-1 activation and IL-1ß secretion was obviously declined. Further exploration, our results showed that when corticosteroid preprocessed macrophages before LPS primed, it obviously inhibited the activation of caspase-1 and the maturation of IL-1ß, which depended on inhibiting the nuclear factor-&#954;B (NF-&#954;B) signal pathway activation. However, when corticosteroids intervened the LPS-primed macrophages, it also negatively regulated NLRP3-inflammasome activation through suppressing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production. Our results revealed that corticosteroids played a protection role in LPS-induced inflammation and ALI by suppressing both NF-&#954;B signal pathway and mtROS-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome activation.","Yang, Jia-Wei; Mao, Bei; Tao, Ru-Jia; Fan, Li-Chao; Lu, Hai-Wen; Ge, Bao-Xue; Xu, Jin-Fu",J. cell. mol. med,,585

METHODS: We closely tracked the epidemiological history, diagnosis and treatment process, as well as dynamic changes in routine blood indicators, of a severe COVID-19 patient who was hospitalized for 26 days. RESULTS: Our study found that the patient's condition worsened in the first week after admission, white blood cells (WBCs), neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelets (PLT) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) decreased. On the 7th day of admission, the levels of these cells decreased to their lowest values, though the red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level remained at high values. From 8 to 14 days of admission, the patient's condition improved, hypoxemia was corrected, and mechanical ventilation was discontinued. The number of WBCs, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and lymphocytes increased gradually, and the erythrocyte parameters stopped declining and stabilized in a certain range; CRP decreased rapidly. On the 20th day of admission, the nucleic acid test was negative, WBC, neutrophil, CRP, NLR and PLR decreased gradually, and monocyte, lymphocyte, and eosinophil counts increased. Although RBCs and hemoglobin (Hb) levels continued to decrease, RDW gradually increased, indicating the recovery of hematopoiesis. In addition, it should be noted that monocytes and eosinophils were at extremely low levels within 10 days after admission; the recovery time of eosinophils was approximately 12 days after admission, which was earlier than other parameters, which might be of great value in judging the progress of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic changes in routine blood parameters might be helpful for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and evaluation of the treatment effect.","Lu, Guoguang; Wang, Jing",Clin Chim Acta,,585

425063,SIRSi-Vaccine dynamical model for Covid-19 pandemic,2021-04-15,"OBJECTIVE: Herein we used near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging in a pilot study to assess lymphatics in pre-ulcerative (C2-C4) venous insufficiency and determine whether involvement and/or degradation of lymphatic anatomy or function could play a role in the progression of chronic venous insufficiency. We also explored the role of lymphatics in early peripheral arterial disease. METHODS: After informed consent and following intradermal injections of indocyanine green for rapid lymphatic uptake, near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging was employed to assess lymphatic anatomical structure and quantify lymphatic propulsion rates in subjects with early venous insufficiency. Anatomical observations included interstitial backflow, characterized by the abnormal spreading of indocyanine green from the injection site primarily into the surrounding interstitial tissues; dermal backflow, characterized by the retrograde movement of dye-laden lymph from collecting lymphatics into the lymphatic capillaries; and lymphatic vessel segmentation and dilation. RESULTS: Ten venous insufficiency subjects were enrolled, resulting in three legs with C2 disease, eight legs with C3, eight legs with C4 disease, and one leg with C5 disease. Interstitial and/or dermal backflow were observed in 25%, 33%, and 41% of injection sites in each limb with C2, C3, and C4 disease, respectively. Distinct vessel segmentation and dilation was observed in limbs with C3 and higher classification, and dermal backflow proximal to the injection sites was observed in two legs with C4 disease and in the inguinal region of the C5 study subject. Overall average lymph propulsion rates were 1.3±0.4 contractile events/min, 1.2±0.7 events/min, and 0.8±0.5 events/min for limbs with C2, C3, and C4 disease respectively. One subject with peripheral arterial disease, who had previously undergone bypass surgery, presented with extensive dermal backflow and lymphatic reflux. CONCLUSIONS: Near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging demonstrate that, compared to normal health subjects, lymphatic anatomy and contractile function generally degrade with severity of venous insufficiency. Lymphatic abnormalities mimic those in early cancer-acquired lymphedema subjects, as previously observed by us and others. Additional studies are needed to decipher the relationship, including any causality, between lymphatic dysfunction and peripheral vascular disease and venous insufficiency.","Rasmussen, John C; Zhu, Banghe; Morrow, John R; Aldrich, Melissa B; Sahihi, Aaron; Harlin, Stuart A; Fife, Caroline E; O039,; Donnell, Thomas F; Sevick-Muraca, Eva M",J.

ObjectiveTo explore use of electronic health record (EHR) data to inform an administrative data algorithm for classification of supplemental oxygen or noninvasive ventilation (O2/NIV) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) to assess disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, we developed an initial procedure-based algorithm to identify O2/NIV, IMV, and NEITHER O2/NIV nor IMV in two inpatient RWD sources. We then expanded the algorithm to explore the impact of adding diagnoses indicative of clinical need for O2/NIV (hypoxia, hypoxemia) or IMV (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and O2-related patient vitals available in the EHR. Observed changes in severity categorization were used to augment the administrative algorithm. SettingOptum de-identified COVID-19 EHR data and HealthVerity claims and chargemaster data (March - August 2020). ParticipantsAmong patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in each RWD source, our motivating example selected dexamethasone (DEX+) initiators and a random selection of patients who were non-initiators of a corticosteroid of interest (CSI-) matched on date of DEX initiation, age, sex, baseline comorbidity score, days since admission, and COVID-19 severity level (NEITHER, O2/NIV, IMV) on treatment index. Main Outcome and MeasuresInpatient COVID-19 severity was defined using the algorithms developed to classify respiratory support requirements among hospitalized COVID-19 patients (NEITHER, O2/NIV, IMV). Measures were reported as the treatment-specific distributions of patients in each severity level, and as observed changes in severity categorization between the initial procedure-based and expanded algorithms. ResultsIn the administrative data cohort with 5,524 DEX+ and CSI- patient pairs matched using the initial procedure-based algorithm, 30% were categorized as O2/NIV, 5% as IMV, and 65% as NEITHER. Among patients assigned NEITHER via the initial algorithm, use of an expanded algorithm informed by the EHR-based algorithm shifted 54% DEX+ and 28% CSI- to O2/NIV, and 2% DEX+ and 1% CSI- to IMV. Among patients initially assigned O2/NIV, 7% DEX+ and 3% CSI- shifted to IMV. Conclusions and RelevanceApplication of learnings from an EHR-based exploration to our administrative algorithm minimized treatment-differential misclassification of COVID-19 severity.","Garry, Elizabeth M; Weckstein, Andrew R; Quinto, Kenneth; Lasky, Tamar; Chakravarty, Aloka; Leonard, Sandy; Vititoe, Sarah E; Easthausen, Imaani J; Rassen, Jeremy A; Gatto, Nicolle M",,,585
426306,Concerns and strategies for wastewater treatment during COVID-19 pandemic to stop plausible transmission,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread around the globe, infecting more than ten million individuals, with more than 500,000 dead; about one half of the infected people have recovered. Despite this fact, a subgroup of individuals affected by COVID-19 is at greater risk of developing worse outcomes and experience a high rate of mortality. Data on the association between obesity and COVID-19 are growing; the available studies, have reported a high prevalence of overweight and obesity in patients experiencing a severe COVID-19 course, with serious complications requiring hospitalization and admission to intensive care units. This paper attempts to highlight potential mechanisms behind the greater vulnerability to COVID-19 of individuals with obesity. The presence of uncontrolled chronic obesity-related comorbidities, particularly pulmonary diseases, can present a primary fertile soil for respiratory tract infection. Combined with immune system impairments, such as alteration in the T-cell proliferation and macrophage differentiation, and the high pro-inflammatory cytokine production by the adipose organ, this may worsen the general condition toward a systemic diffusion of infection. Prevention remains the first line of intervention in these patients that can be achieved by adhering to social distancing and adopting hygiene precautions, combined with a healthy lifestyle. Patients with obesity require preferential access dedicated to primary care services to ensure they are regularly taking their medications for the treatment of any concurrent chronic diseases. Finally, their physicians must promptly manage any medical signs or symptoms in the case of suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) infection to prevent the risk of severe outcomes.","Valerio, Alessandra; Nisoli, Enzo; Rossi, Andrea P; Pellegrini, Massimo; Todesco, Tiziana; El Ghoch, Marwan",J Popul Ther Clin Pharmacol,,585

Gaining insights into the inflammatory dysregulation that causes sepsis would help develop new therapeutic strategies against severe sepsis. In this study, we identified the crucial role of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the regulation of the Toll-like receptor 9-mediated proinflammatory pathway in severe sepsis progression. Hypothesizing that removing cfDNA would be beneficial for sepsis treatment, we used polyethylenimine (PEI) and synthesized PEI-functionalized, biodegradable mesoporous silica nanoparticles with different charge densities as cfDNA scavengers. These nucleic acid-binding nanoparticles (NABNs) showed superior performance compared with their nucleic acid-binding polymer counterparts on inhibition of cfDNA-induced inflammation and subsequent multiple organ injury caused by severe sepsis. Furthermore, NABNs exhibited enhanced accumulation and retention in the inflamed cecum, along with a more desirable in vivo safety profile. Together, our results revealed a key contribution of cfDNA in severe sepsis and shed a light on the development of NABN-based therapeutics for sepsis therapy, which currently remains intractable.","Dawulieti, Jianati; Sun, Madi; Zhao, Yawei; Shao, Dan; Yan, Huize; Lao, Yeh-Hsing; Hu, Hanze; Cui, Lianzhi; Lv, Xiaoyan; Liu, Feng; Chi, Chun-Wei; Zhang, Yue; Li, Mingqiang; Zhang, Ming; Tian, Huayu; Chen, Xuesi; Leong, Kam W; Chen, Li",Sci.

428057,Impact of COVID-19 on Migrant Labourers of India and China,2020,"Phospholipid monolayers at oil-water interfaces are used for various biological applications and often formed by vesicle adsorption. However, the adsorbed structures are not well characterized; therefore, fundamental investigation on vesicle adsorption behavior is necessary for correct understanding of the monolayer systems. Herein, we investigated the adsorption of phosphatidylcholine vesicles onto silicone oil-water interfaces using fluorescence microscopy and pendant drop tensiometry. The interfacial monolayer coverage, S, was determined by assuming S = 1 for tightly packed monolayers. Adsorption for 10 min with a lipid concentration of 0.2 mM resulted in S &#8776; 0.4. An increase in lipid concentration (0.5-2 mM) and adsorption time (1 h) moderately increased monolayer coverage (S &#8776; 0.6). However, extended adsorption for 24 h only slightly increased coverage (S &#8776; 0.7). Monolayers with an S < 0.6 were homogeneous, while those with an S > 0.6 were associated with several vesicular structures. The surface density of these bound vesicles increased with increasing S. We conclude that vesicles readily fused with the interface to form monolayers at S < 0.6 and that their fusogenicity considerably decreased at S > 0.6. These results demonstrate that the ability of vesicles to form monolayers is determined by the interfacial coverage.","Kataoka-Hamai, Chiho; Kawakami, Kohsaku",J Phys Chem B,,585

428677,The Systemic Crisis Caused by Covid-19 and Its Impact on the University,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to shortage of intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. We developed a triage strategy including noninvasive respiratory support and admission to the intermediate care unit (IMCU). ICU admission was restricted to patients requiring invasive ventilation. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to the IMCU. METHOD: Retrospective cohort including consecutive patients admitted between March 28 and April 27, 2020. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure avoiding ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included the rate of emergency intubation, 28-day mortality, and predictors of ICU admission. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-seven patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia were admitted to the IMCU. Among the 85 patients admitted for worsening respiratory failure, 52/85 (61%) avoided ICU admission. In multivariate analysis, PaO2/FiO2 (OR 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96-0.99) and BMI (OR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.78-0.98) were significantly associated with ICU admission. No death or emergency intubation occurred in the IMCU. CONCLUSIONS: IMCU admission including standardized triage criteria, self-proning, and noninvasive respiratory support prevents ICU admission for a large proportion of patients with COVID-19 hypoxemic respiratory failure. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, IMCUs may play an important role in preserving ICU capacity by avoiding ICU admission for patients with worsening respiratory failure and allowing early discharge of ICU patients.","Grosgurin, Olivier; Leidi, Antonio; Farhoumand, Pauline Darbellay; Carballo, Sebastian; Adler, Dan; Reny, Jean-Luc; Bollen Pinto, Bernardo; Rossel, Anne; Serratrice, Jacques; Agoritsas, Thomas; Stirnemann, Jérôme; Marti, Christophe",Respiration,,585

The most feared complication of COVID-19 is the combination of coagulopathy and thromboembolism, which is consequent to thrombo-inflammation and a heightened prothrombotic state. It is exaggerated in severe COVID associated with sepsis and skin manifestations that correlate with severity are more useful to clinicians. We had a case of COVID-positive 65-year-old man with features of thromboembolism followed by general symptoms of cough and fever. D-dimer test was positive, and the Ultrasound Doppler showed thrombosis in the right lower limb arteries and deep vein thrombosis in right lower limb veins.","Shubhra, Shubhra; Yadav, Amlendu; Sardana, Kabir; Goila, Ajay Kumar",J. cosmet. dermatol,,585

There is concern regarding whether an individual exposed to one variant of a virus will have cross-reactive memory to the second. Accordingly, we analyzed the serologic reactivity of both variants, and found that antibodies from 88 donors from a high-incidence population reacted toward both the original spike and the D614 spike variant. These data suggest patients who are exposed to either variant have cross-responsive humoral immunity.

430924,COVID-19 in Africa: the little we know and the lot we ignore,2020,"Mathematical models can provide insights into the control of pandemic COVID-19, which remains a global priority. The dynamics of directly-transmitted infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, are usually described by compartmental models where individuals are classified as susceptible, infected and removed. These SIR models typically assume homogenous transmission of infection, even in large populations, a simplification that is convenient but inconsistent with observations. Here we use original data on the dynamics of COVID-19 spread in a Brazilian city to investigate the structure of the transmission network. We find that transmission can be described by a network in which each infectious individual has a small number of susceptible contacts, of the order of 2-5, which is independent of total population size. Compared with standard models of homogenous mixing, this scale-free, fractal infection process gives a better description of COVID-19 dynamics through time. In addition, the contact process explains the geographically localized clusters of disease seen in this Brazilian city. Our scale-free model can help refine criteria for physical and social distancing in order to more effectively mitigate the spread of COVID-19. We propose that scale-free COVID-19 dynamics could be a widespread phenomenon, a topic for further investigation.","Policarpo, Josue M. P.; Ramos, Arthur A. G.

This study aims to systematically review the hematologic autoimmune complications in these patients. METHOD: Data from three online databases including Medline (via PubMed), Scopus and Web of Science were searched on 19 December 2020, and after excluding duplicate, irrelevant and inappropriate records, eligible documents were identified. Afterwards, information such as patients' history, presentations, paraclinical data, treatment course and outcome were extracted from the records. RESULTS: A total of 58 documents were considered to be eligible for data extraction which described 94 patients with COVID-19 who developed hematologic autoimmune disorder in their course of infection. Of these patients with COVID-19, the most common hematologic autoimmune disorder was immune thrombocytopenic purpura (55 cases) followed by autoimmune hemolytic anemia (22 cases). Other hematologic autoimmune disorders include antiphospholipid syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, Evans syndrome and autoimmune neutropenia. CONCLUSION: The current study would help us to always consider an autoimmune etiology for cases with abnormal hematologic finding which further lead to an appropriate treatment of the patients, especially when the symptoms present in about 1-2 weeks after the first manifestation of the infection symptoms. Maybe, at least in this pandemic, it should be recommended to evaluate patients with unexpected and unexplained decrease in their hemoglobulin or platelet count for COVID-19. Another challenging issue is the treatment options. Given the multiorgan involvement and multifaceted nature of the infection, an individualized approach should be taken for each patient.","Taherifard, Erfan; Taherifard, Ehsan; Movahed, Hamed; Mousavi, Mohammad Reza",Hematology,,585

431860,Assessing the Online Objective Structured Clinical Examinations in Urology Qualifying Exam for Urology Residents in Indonesia during Covid-19 Time,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears to be an independent risk factor for stroke. We hypothesize that patients who develop stroke while hospitalized for severe COVID-19 will have higher inflammatory markers and distinct stroke imaging patterns compared with patients positive for COVID-19 with out-of-hospital stroke onset and milder or no COVID-19 symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective case series of patients positive for COVID-19 on polymerase chain reaction testing with imaging-confirmed stroke treated within a large health care network in New York City and Long Island between March 14 and April 26, 2020. Clinical and laboratory data collected retrospectively included complete blood counts and creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer levels. All CT and MR imaging studies were independently reviewed by 2 neuroradiologists who recorded stroke subtype and patterns of infarction and intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS: Compared with patients with COVID-19 with outside-of-hospital stroke onset and milder or no COVID-19 symptoms (n = 45, 52.3%), patients with stroke already hospitalized for severe COVID-19 (n = 41, 47.7%) had significantly more frequent infarctions (95.1% versus 73.3%, P = .006), with multivascular distributions (56.4% versus 33.3%, P = .022) and associated hemorrhage (31.7% versus 4.4%, P = .001). Patients with stroke admitted with more severe COVID-19 had significantly higher C-reactive protein and ferritin levels, elevated D-dimer levels, and more frequent lymphopenia and renal and hepatic injury (all, P < .003). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stroke hospitalized with severe COVID-19 are characterized by higher inflammatory, coagulopathy, and tissue-damage biomarkers, supporting proposed pathogenic mechanisms of hyperinflammation activating a prothrombotic state. Cautious balancing of thrombosis and the risk of hemorrhagic transformation is warranted when considering anticoagulation.","Katz, J M; Libman, R B; Wang, J J; Filippi, C G; Sanelli, P; Zlochower, A; Gribko, M; Pacia, S V; Kuzniecky, R I; Najjar, S; Azhar, S",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,,585

Longitudinal observational study including veterans receiving mental health treatment at a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facility from January 1, 2017 to June 16, 2020. Observed and expected patient care for on-going and new treatment of depression, posttraumatic stress, substance use disorder, severe mental illness diagnoses, overdose, and suicide attempts, and psychotropic prescriptions for antidepressant, antipsychotic, benzodiazepine, opioid, and mood stabilizing medications are depicted. Percent change between actual and expected counts in the early months of the COVID pandemic (March 18-May 5, 2020) are computed. Decreases in counts of patients receiving mental health treatment early in the pandemic ranged from 7% to 20% for on-going treatment, and 28% to 37% for new treatment. TMH rapidly expanded across VHA, becoming the primary means by which encounters were delivered. Counts of patients receiving on-going care for suicide attempts were stable, and for overdoses, decreased by 17%. Counts of patients initiating care for suicide attempts and overdoses decreased by 30% and 38%, respectively. Weekly prescriptions and medication on-hand for psychotropics ranged from a 2% decrease to a 4% increase. New patient prescribing decreased 21%-50%. VHA and other large healthcare systems will need to expand outreach and continue to develop TMH services to maintain care continuity and initiate care for existing and new patients during COVID-19 and future large-scale outbreaks, epidemics, and disasters.

433071,COVID-19: Effectiveness of Socioeconomic Factors in Containing the Spread and Mortality (preprint),2020,"The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and has since spread quickly around the world. To date, the virus has infected tens of millions of people worldwide, compelling governments to implement strict policies to counteract community spread. Federal, provincial, and municipal governments have employed various public health policies, including social distancing, mandatory mask wearing, and the closure of schools and businesses. However, the implementation of these policies can be difficult and costly, making it imperative that both policy makers and the citizenry understand their potential benefits and the risks of non-compliance. In this work, a mathematical model is developed to study the impact of social behaviour on the course of the pandemic in the province of Ontario. The approach is based upon a standard SEIRD model with a variable transmission rate that depends on the behaviour of the population. The model parameters, which characterize the disease dynamics, are estimated from Ontario COVID-19 epidemiological data using machine learning techniques. A key result of the model, following from the variable transmission rate, is the prediction of the occurrence of a second wave using the most current infection data and disease-specific traits. The qualitative behaviour of different future transmission-reduction strategies is examined, and the time-varying reproduction number is analyzed using existing epidemiological data and future projections. Importantly, the effective reproduction number, and thus the course of the pandemic, is found to be sensitive to the adherence to public health policies, illustrating the need for vigilance as the economy continues to reopen.","Eastman, Brydon; Meaney, Cameron; Przedborski, Michelle; Kohandel, Mohammad",PLoS One,,585

Compared to PCR and serology tests, SARS-CoV-2 antigen assays are underdeveloped, despite their potential to identify active infection and monitor disease progression. METHODS: We used Single Molecule Array (Simoa) assays to quantitatively detect SARS-CoV-2 spike, S1 subunit, and nucleocapsid antigens in the plasma of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. We studied plasma from 64 COVID-19 positive patients, 17 COVID-19 negative patients, and 34 pre-pandemic patients. Combined with Simoa anti-SARS-CoV-2 serological assays, we quantified changes in 31 SARS-CoV-2 biomarkers in 272 longitudinal plasma samples obtained for 39 COVID-19 patients. Data were analyzed by hierarchical clustering and were compared to longitudinal RT-PCR test results and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 S1 and N antigens were detectable in 41 out of 64 COVID-19 positive patients. In these patients, full antigen clearance in plasma was observed a mean ± 95%CI of 5 ± 1 days after seroconversion and nasopharyngeal RT-PCR tests reported positive results for 15 ± 5 days after viral antigen clearance. Correlation between patients with high concentrations of S1 antigen and ICU admission (77%) and time to intubation (within one day) was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The reported SARS-CoV-2 Simoa antigen assay is the first to detect viral antigens in the plasma of COVID-19 positive patients to date. These data show that SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens in the blood are associated with disease progression, such as respiratory failure, in COVID-19 cases with severe disease.","Ogata, Alana F; Maley, Adam M; Wu, Connie; Gilboa, Tal; Norman, Maia; Lazarovits, Roey; Mao, Chih-Ping; Newton, Gail; Chang, Matthew; Nguyen, Katrina; Kamkaew, Maliwan; Zhu, Quan; Gibson, Travis E; Ryan, Edward T; Charles, Richelle C; Marasco, Wayne A; Walt, David R",Clin. chem,,585

The population characteristics, symptoms, and laboratory examination results between the patients in the ICU and those in the general wards were compared. Furthermore, the differences between the deceased patients in the ICU and those discharged from the ICU were compared. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the two groups in terms of symptoms, including fever, shortness of breath, no presence of complications, presence of 1 complication, and presence of 3 or more complications (P<0.05). There were also significant differences between the patients in terms of the laboratory examination results including elevated urea nitrogen, creatinine, direct bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, total protein, albumin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cells, C-reactive protein, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, D-dimer, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, interleukin 2 receptor, tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, troponin I, phosphokinase isoenzyme-MB, and B-type natriuretic peptide; and decreased platelets, lymphocyte absolute value, and eosinophil absolute value (<0.05). There were 45 patients who died in ICU and 57 improved and discharged patients. There were significant differences between the two groups in the number of patients that had 1 complication and 3 or more complications (P<0.05). There were also significant differences in the laboratory examination results between the patients including elevated urea nitrogen, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, procalcitonin, white blood cells, interleukin 8, interleukin 10, phosphokinase isoenzyme-MB, and B-type natriuretic peptide; and decreased platelets and eosinophil absolute value (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that the identified determinants may help to improve treatment of COVID-19 patients, to predict the risk of developing severe illness and to optimizing arrangement of health resources.","Chen, Yuan; Geng, Yue; Xu, Xinhui; Chen, Xiaohua; Gao, Jie; Li, Jian; Zhang, Xuemin",Ann Palliat Med,,585

But its role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still unclear. In this study, frequencies of total and multiple subsets of lymphocytes in peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients and discharged individuals were analyzed using a multicolor flow cytometry assay. Plasma concentration of IL-10 was measured using a microsphere-based immunoassay kit. Comparing to healthy controls, the frequencies of total lymphocytes and T cells decreased significantly in both acutely infected COVID-19 patients and discharged individuals. The frequencies of total lymphocytes correlated negatively with the frequencies of CD3- CD56+ NK cells. The frequencies of regulatory CD8+ CD25+ T cells correlated with CD4+ /CD8+ T cell ratios positively, while the frequencies of regulatory CD4+ CD25+ CD127- T cells correlated negatively with CD4+ /CD8+ T cell ratios. Ratios of CD4+ /CD8+ T cells increased significantly in patients beyond age of 45 years. And accordingly, the frequencies of regulatory CD8+ CD25+ T cells were also found significantly increased in these patients. Collectively, the results suggest that regulatory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells may play distinct roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Moreover, the data indicate that NK cells might contribute to the COVID-19 associated lymphopenia.","Gao, Menglu; Liu, Yili; Guo, Mingquan; Wang, Qianying; Wang, Yan; Fan, Jian; Shen, Yinzhong; Hou, Junjie; Wan, Yanmin; Zhu, Zhaoqin",J. leukoc. biol,,585

University Hospital Institute-Méditerranée Infection performs real-time surveillance of all diagnoses of infections and associated deaths in public hospitals in Marseille, Southeastern France. This study compared mortality associated with diagnoses of respiratory viruses during the colder months of 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 (week 47-week 14). In 2018-2019, 73 patients (0.17% of 42,851 hospitalized patients) died after being diagnosed with a respiratory virus; 40 and 13 deaths occurred in patients diagnosed with influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), respectively. In 2019-2020, 50 patients (0.10% of 49,043 patients hospitalized) died after being diagnosed with a common respiratory virus; seven and seven deaths occurred in patients diagnosed with influenza A virus and RSV, respectively. Additionally, 55 patients died after being diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of respiratory virus-associated deaths among hospitalized patients was thus significantly lower for common respiratory viruses in 2019-2020 than in 2018-2019 (102 versus 170 per 100,000 hospitalized patients; p = 0.003), primarily as a consequence of a decrease in influenza A virus (-83%) and RSV (-46%)-associated deaths. Overall, the proportion of respiratory virus-associated deaths among hospitalized patients was higher, but not significantly, in 2019-2020 than in 2018-2019 (214 versus 170 per 100,000 hospitalized patients; p = 0.08, Yates-corrected Chi-square test).

Beyond economic recovery in a post COVID-19 paradigm, the blue economy, blue growth, and associated activities offer pathways for a more resilient economy and is well-suited for The Bahamas. This paper suggests conduits for economic development using a traditional strength, coastal and marine tourism, in conjunction with the emerging fields of ocean renewable energy, offshore aquaculture, marine biotechnology, and bioprospecting. The interlinkages between each activity are discussed. Knowledge gaps in offshore aquaculture, ocean renewable energy, marine biotechnology, and marine environment monitoring are identified. In each sector case, strategic and tactical decision-making can be achieved through the exploitation of ocean numerical modeling and observations, and consequently should be invested in and developed alongside the requisite computational resources. Blue growth is encouraged, but instances of blue injustice are also highlighted. Crucially, pursuing blue economy activities should be given top national priority for economic recovery and prosperity.","Bethel, Brandon J.; Buravleva, Yana Tang Decai",Water,,585
439370,COVID-19 and cyber fraud: emerging threats during the pandemic,2021,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion for hydrocephalus via ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting is one of the most commonly performed neurosurgical procedures. Unfortunately, VP shunting also carries a high complication rate. While long-term complications of VP shunting are generally well-described, the literature on more acute, iatrogenic injury during shunt placement is essentially limited to easily identifiable intracranial bleeds. Herein is presented the first reported case of iatrogenic abdominal wall vessel injury as a consequence of blind distal VP shunt catheter placement causing a critical haemoperitoneum that necessitated multiple transfusions. Presentation and recognition of this bleed was delayed as it occurred over a number of days. Injury to the inferior epigastric artery, or potentially a distal branch of the superficial epigastric artery, is suspected to have occurred during either blind subcutaneous tunnelling of the shunt catheter passage or during penetration of the peritoneum. Haemoperitoneum as a potential complication of procedures involving manipulation or penetration of the abdominal wall (i.e. paracentesis) is well-described in the medical and general surgical literature, and ultrasound-guidance has been widely adopted to mitigate bleeding in these cases. Familiarity with intra-abdominal haemorrhage as a potential complication of VP shunting and an understanding of its presentation is critical for timely identification of this phenomenon. Furthermore, the use of real-time ultrasound-guidance for tunnelling and distal shunt catheter placement may decrease the incidence of intrabdominal complications after shunt placement more generally and should be considered an area of future study.","Patel, Aneek; Golub, Danielle; Guerrero Zuniga, Adler; Kaufman, Brian",Br J Neurosurg,,585

The French National Health Agency (Haute Autorité de Santé) has urgently recommended the use of medical abortion at home between 7 and 9 weeks of gestation and telemedicine for medical abortion consultations. The main objective of this study was to assess whether the emergency measures undertaken for the management of abortions during the COVID-19 pandemic led to practice changes, and to obtain practitioners' opinions regarding the continuation of these measures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, quantitative, online self-administered survey from August 6, 2020 to October 2, 2020, aimed at health workers performing abortions (midwives, general practitioners, gynecologists obstetricians and medical gynecologists) in the South and Corse regions in France. RESULTS: Among the 124 practitioners included, 59/77 (76.6%) offered medical abortion at home between 7 and 9 weeks of gestation and 61/89 (68.5%) of them wished to carry on this practice. 55/123 (44.7%) practitioners offered telemedicine for medical abortion at home and 71/115 (61.7%) of them wished to carry on this practice. DISCUSSION: The emergency measures implemented by the the French National Health Agency (Haute Autorité de Santé) for medical abortion are approved and followed by the majority of health workers performing abortions in the South and Corse regions.

Experimental studies suggest that vitamin D and calcium may inhibit these pathways, but their effects on colorectal tissue COX-2 and 15-HPGD expression in humans are unknown. We tested the effects of supplemental vitamin D (1,000 I.U./day) and/or calcium (1,200 mg/day) on COX-2 and 15-HPGD expression in the morphologically-normal rectal mucosa from 62 colorectal adenoma patients in a placebo-controlled chemoprevention trial. We measured biomarker expression using automated immunohistochemistry and quantitative image analysis at baseline and 1-year follow-up, and assessed treatment effects using mixed linear models. The primary outcome was the COX-2/15-HPGD expression ratio, since these enzymes function as physiologic antagonists. After 1 year of treatment, the mean COX-2/15-HPGD expression ratio in full-length crypts proportionately decreased 47% in the vitamin D group (P = 0.001), 46% in the calcium group (P = 0.002), and 34% in the calcium + vitamin D group (P = 0.03), relative to the placebo group. Among individuals with the functional vitamin D-binding protein isoform DBP2 (GC rs4588*A), the COX-2/15-HPDG ratio decreased 70% (P = 0.0006), 75% (P = 0.0002), and 60% (P = 0.006) in the vitamin D, calcium, and combined supplementation groups, respectively, relative to placebo. These results show that vitamin D and calcium favorably modulate the balance of expression of COX-2 and 15-HPGD-biomarkers of inflammation that are strongly linked to colorectal carcinogenesis-in the normal-appearing colorectal mucosa of colorectal adenoma patients (perhaps especially those with the DBP2 isoform).","Gibbs, David Corley; Fedirko, Veronika; Baron, John A; Barry, Elizabeth L; Flanders, W Dana; McCullough, Marjorie L; Yacoub, Rami; Raavi, Tapasya; Rutherford, Robin E; Seabrook, March E; Bostick, Roberd M",Cancer prev. res.

443077,"Functionality of Nanomaterials and its Technological Aspects - Used in Preventing, Diagnosing and Treating COVID-19",2021,"A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) has been confirmed as having the capacity to transmit from humans to humans, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury. Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is known to be expressed on type II pneumocytes. As a counter-regulatory arm of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of ARDS and acute lung injury. The affinity of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 for human ACE2 (hACE2) largely determines the degree of clinical symptoms after infection by SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies have shown that regulating the ACE2/RAS system is effective in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-induced ARDS and acute lung injury. Since ACE2 is the host cell receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, regulating the ACE2/RAS system may alleviate ARDS and acute lung injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV. Vitamin D was found to affect ACE2, the target of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, we propose that vitamin D might alleviate ARDS and acute lung injury induced by SARS-CoV-2 by modulating ACE2.","Xiao, Dongqiong; Li, Xihong; Su, Xiaojuan; Mu, Dezhi; Qu, Yi",Int J Infect Dis,,585

Rapidly increasing infections has raised intense worldwide attention. How to model the evolution of COVID-19 effectively and efficiently is of great significance for prevention and control. Methods: We propose the multi-chain Fudan-CCDC model based on the original single-chain model in [Shao et al. 2020] to describe the evolution of COVID-19 in Singapore. Multi-chains can be considered as the superposition of several single chains with different characteristics. We identify the parameters of models by minimizing the penalty function. Results: The numerical simulation results exhibit the multi-chain model performs well on data fitting. Though unsteady the increments are, they could still fall within the range of _30% fluctuation from simulation results.

445179,"Rapid Antibody-Based COVID-19 Mass Surveillance: Relevance, Challenges, and Prospects in a Pandemic and Post-Pandemic World",2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to dramatic social and economic changes in daily life. First studies report an impact on mental health of the general population showing increased levels of anxiety, stress and depression. In this study, we compared the impact of the pandemic on two culturally and economically similar European countries: the UK and Germany. METHODS: Participants (UK = 241, German = 541) completed an online-survey assessing COVID-19 exposure, impact on financial situation and work, substance and media consumption, mental health using the Symptom-Check-List-27 (SCL-27) and the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. RESULTS: We found distinct differences between the two countries. UK responders reported a stronger direct impact on health, financial situation and families. UK responders had higher clinical scores on the SCL-27, and higher prevalence. Interestingly, German responders were less hopeful for an end of the pandemic and more concerned about their life-stability. CONCLUSION: As 25% of both German and UK responders reported a subjective worsening of the general psychological symptoms and 20-50% of German and UK responders reached the clinical cut-off for depressive and dysthymic symptoms as well as anxieties, it specifically shows the need for tailored intervention systems to support large proportions of the general public.","Knolle, Franziska; Ronan, Lisa; Murray, Graham K",BMC Psychol,,585

This study is based on designing of polypeptide vaccines (PVs) against human malaria that cover almost all stages of life-cycle of Plasmodium and for the same 5 genome derived predicted antigenic proteins (GDPAP) have been used. For the development of a multi-immune inducer, 15 PVs were initially designed using T-cell epitope ensemble, which covered >99% human population as well as linear B-cell epitopes with or without adjuvants. The immune simulation of PVs showed higher levels of T-cell and B-cell activities compared to positive and negative vaccine controls. Furthermore, in silico cloning of PVs and codon optimization followed by enhanced expression within Lactococcus lactis host system was also explored.

This paper helps explain Korea's pre-existing capabilities which enabled the rapid and effective implementation of its COVID-19 control strategies. A systematic assessment across multiple domains demonstrates that South Korea's advantages in controlling its epidemic are owed tremendously to legal and organizational reforms enacted after the MERS outbreak in 2015. Successful implementation of the Korean strategy required more than just a set of actions, measures and policies.

They lack explicit dynamics and have multiple sources of cost, both of which are beyond the current scope of traditional control theory. We construct the global economy risk network by combining the consensus of experts from the World Economic Forum with risk activation data to define its topology and interactions. Many of these risks, including extreme weather and drastic inflation, pose significant economic costs when active. We introduce a method for converting network interaction data into continuous dynamics to which we apply optimal control. We contribute the first method for constructing and controlling risk network dynamics based on empirically collected data. We simulate applying this method to control the spread of COVID-19 and show that the choice of risks through which the network is controlled has significant influence on both the cost of control and the total cost of keeping network stable. We additionally describe a heuristic for choosing the risks trough which the network is controlled, given a general risk network.","Brissette, Christopher; Niu, Xiang; Jiang, Chunheng; Gao, Jianxi; Korniss, Gyorgy; Szymanski, Boleslaw K",Sci Rep,,585
449226,Trainee perspectives of COVID-19 impact on medical genetics education,2021,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been highlighted for its role as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. This review summarizes current knowledge about ACE2 as a multifunctional protein, focusing on its relevance in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). As an enzyme, ACE2 may be protective in IBD because it favors the counter-regulatory arm of the renin-angiotensin system or deleterious because it metabolizes other anti-inflammatory/repairing elements. Meanwhile, as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the impact of ACE2 expression/activity on infection is still under debate because no direct evidence has been reported and, again, both protective and deleterious pathways are possible. Research has shown that ACE2 regulates the expression of the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1, controlling tryptophan-associated intestinal inflammation and nutritional status. Finally, intact membrane-bound or shed soluble ACE2 can also trigger integrin signaling, modulating the response to anti-integrin biologic drugs used to treat IBD (such as vedolizumab) and fibrosis, a long-term complication of IBD. As such, future studies on ACE2 expression/activity in IBD can improve monitoring of the disease and explore an alternative pharmacological target.","Ferreira-Duarte, Mariana; Estevinho, Maria Manuela; Duarte-Araújo, Margarida; Magro, Fernando; Morato, Manuela",Inflamm Bowel Dis,,585

Untreated depression during pregnancy may have long-term effects on the mother and offspring. Therefore, delineating the effects of pregnancy on the mental health of reproductive-age women is crucial. This study aims to determine the risk for depressive symptoms in pregnant and non-pregnant women during COVID-19, and to identify its bio-psycho-social contributors. A total of 1114 pregnant and 256 non-pregnant women were recruited via social media in May 2020 to complete an online survey that included depression and anxiety questionnaires, as well as demographic, obstetric and COVID-19-related questionnaires. Pregnant women also completed the Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS). Pregnant women reported fewer depressive symptoms and were less concerned that they had COVID-19 than non-pregnant women. Among pregnant women, risk factors for depression included lower income, fewer children, unemployment, thinking that one has COVID-19, high-risk pregnancy, earlier gestational age, and increased pregnancy-related stress. Protective factors included increased partner support, healthy behaviors, and positive appraisal of the pregnancy. Thus, being pregnant is associated with reduced risk for depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Increased social support, engaging in health behaviors and positive appraisal may enhance resilience. Future studies of pregnant versus non-pregnant women could clarify the role of pregnancy during stressful events, and clarify aspects of susceptibility and resilience during pregnancy.","Yirmiya, K.; Yakirevich-Amir, N.; Preis, H.; Lotan, A.; Atzil, S.; Reuveni, I.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],,585

451105,IOTECH in times of COVID-19,2020,"Background and aimsTLR4 is an important innate immune receptor that recognizes bacterial LPS, viral proteins and other pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). It is expressed on tissue-resident and immune cells. We previously proposed a model whereby SARS-CoV-2 activation of TLR4 via its spike glycoprotein S1 domain increases ACE2 expression, viral loads and hyperinflammation with COVID-19 disease [1]. Here we test this hypothesis in vitro and demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 domain is a TLR4 agonist in rat and human cells and induces a pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage phenotype in human THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages. MethodsAdult rat cardiac tissue resident macrophage-derived fibrocytes (rcTMFs) were treated with either bacterial LPS or recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoprotein. The expression of ACE2 and other inflammatory and fibrosis markers were assessed by immunoblotting. S1/TLR4 co-localisation/binding was assessed by immunocytochemistry and proximity ligation assays on rcTMFs and human HEK-293 HA-TLR4-expressing cells. THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into M1 or M2 macrophages with LPS/IFN{gamma}, S1/IFN{gamma} or IL-4 and RNA was extracted for RT-qPCR of M1/M2 markers and ACE2. ResultsTLR4 activation by spike S1 or LPS resulted in the upregulation of ACE2 in rcTMFs as shown by immunoblotting. Likewise, spike S1 caused TLR4-mediated induction of the inflammatory/wound healing marker COX-2 and concomitant downregulation of the fibrosis markers CTGF and Col3a1, similar to LPS. The specific TLR4 TIR domain signalling inhibitor CLI-095 (Resatorvid(R)), blocked the effects of spike S1 and LPS, confirming that spike S1 is a TLR4 agonist and viral PAMP (VAMP). ACE2 expression was also inhibited by the dynamin inhibitor Dynasore(R), suggesting ACE2 expression is mediated by the alternative endosomal/{beta}-interferon pathway. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed 1:1 stoichiometric spike S1 co-localisation with TLR4 in rat and human cells. Furthermore, proximity ligation assays confirmed spike S1 and TLR4 binding in human and rat cells. Spike S1/IFN-{gamma} treatment of THP-1-derived macrophages induced pro-inflammatory M1 polarisation as shown by an increase in IL-1{beta} and IL-6 mRNA. ConclusionsThese results confirm that TLR4 is activated by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain and therefore TLR4 may be a receptor/accessory factor for the virus. By binding to and activating TLR4, spike S1 caused upregulation of ACE2, which may facilitate viral entry into cells. In addition, pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage polarisation via TLR4 activation, links TLR4 activation by spike S1 to inflammation. The clinical trial testing of CLI-095 (Resatorvid(R)) and other TLR4 antagonists in severe COVID-19, to reduce both viral entry into cells and hyperinflammation, is warranted. Our findings likely represent an important development in COVID-19 pathophysiology and treatment, particularly regarding cardiac complications and the role of macrophages.",,,,585
451243,Evolution of Smart Healthcare: Telemedicine During COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Water is essential for a sustainable economic prosperity, but rapid economic growth and intensive agricultural activities usually cause water pollution. The middle and lower reaches of China’s Yangtze River Basin were urbanized and industrialized much earlier than the upper reach and have been suffering from water pollution. In the past two decades, economic growth accelerated in the upper reach due to several national economic initiatives. Based on analyzing water quality changes from 2000 to 2019 and during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 for Chengdu in the upper reach, we hope to provide some water governance suggestions. In 2019, water at 66% of 93 sites in Chengdu did not achieve the national III standards using measurements of 23 water quality parameters. The top two pollutants were total nitrogen (TN) and fecal coliform (FC). From 2000 to 2019, water quality was not significantly improved at the non-background sites of Chengdu's Min Basin, and the pollution in this basin was mainly from local pollutants release. During the same period, water quality deteriorated in Chengdu’s Tuo Basin, where pollution was the result of pollutant discharges in Chengdu in addition to inter-city pollutant transport.

451244,Evolution of Smart Healthcare: Telemedicine During COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BackgroundIn coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), finding sensitive biomarkers is critical for detecting severe cases early and intervening effectively. ObjectivesTo compare and evaluate the predictive value of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and their derived immune-inflammatory indices (CRP/albumin (CRP/alb), lymphocyte/CRP (L/CRP), and lymphocyte/IL-6 (L/IL-6)) in COVID-19 patients. MethodsOn admission, 85 confirmed COVID-19 patients measured and collected laboratory data were obtained and compared. ResultsLevels of CRP, IL-6, and CRP/alb were significantly higher (P=0.001) in severe patients and non-survivors, but L/CRP and L/IL-6 were significantly lower (P=0.001). The best predictive performance for COVID-19 severity was observed at 1.65 for CRP/alb and 260.86 for L/CRP with 84.7% diagnostic accuracy for both. The best diagnostic accuracy for COVID-19 in-hospital mortality was 87.1% by IL-6 at 120 pg/ml and 85.9% by L/IL-6 at 5.40. The performance of the combined prediction was better than the single prediction by one biomarker. IL-6 was an independent risk factor associated with severe disease development (odds ratio: 1.033; 95% confidence interval: 1.002-1.066). ConclusionsPretreatment values of CRP, IL-6, and their derived indices could be included in the diagnostic work-up of COVID-19 to stratify disease severity and predict outcomes.","Taha, Sara I.; Shata, Aalaa K.; Baioumy, Shereen A.; Fouad, Shaimaa H.; Moussa, Aya H.; Abdalgeleel, Shaimaa A.; Youssef, Mariam K.",,,585

454377,COVID-19 medical management including World Health Organization (WHO) suggested management strategies,2020,"BACKGROUND: In an effort to contain the effects of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, health care systems worldwide implemented telemedical solutions to overcome staffing, technical, and infrastructural limitations. In Germany, a multitude of telemedical systems are already being used, while new approaches are rapidly being developed in response to the crisis. However, the extent of the current implementation within different health care settings, the user's acceptance and perception, as well as the hindering technical and regulatory obstacles remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to assess the current status quo of the availability and routine use of telemedical solutions, user acceptance, and the subjectively perceived burdens on telemedical approaches. Furthermore, we seek to assess the perception of public information quality among professional groups and their preferred communication channels. METHODS: A national online survey was conducted on 14 consecutive days in March and April 2020, and distributed to doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals in the German language. RESULTS: A total of 2827 medical professionals participated in the study. Doctors accounted for 65.6% (n=1855) of the professionals, 29.5% (n=833) were nursing staff, and 4.9% (n=139) were identified as others such as therapeutic staff. A majority of participants rated the significance of telemedicine within the crisis as high (1065/2730, 39%) or neutral (n=720, 26.4%); however, there were significant differences between doctors and nurses (P=.01) as well as between the stationary sector compared to the ambulatory sector (P<.001). Telemedicine was already in routine use for 19.6% (532/2711) of German health care providers and in partial use for 40.2% (n=1090). Participants working in private practices (239/594, 40.2%) or private clinics (23/59, 39.0%) experienced less regulatory or technical obstacles compared to university hospitals (586/1190, 49.2%). A majority of doctors rated the public information quality on COVID-19 as good (942/1855, 50.8%) or very good (213/1855, 11.5%); nurses rated the quality of public information significantly lower (P<.001). Participant's age negatively correlated with the perception of telemedicine's significance (&#961;=-0.23; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine has a broad acceptance among German medical professionals. However, to establish telemedical structures within routine care, technical and regulatory burdens must be overcome.","Peine, Arne; Paffenholz, Pia; Martin, Lukas; Dohmen, Sandra; Marx, Gernot; Loosen, Sven H",J Med Internet Res,,585

BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulated with a toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG) or alum (Algel). METHODS: We did a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 1 trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of BBV152 at 11 hospitals across India. Healthy adults aged 18-55 years who were deemed healthy by the investigator were eligible. Individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and/or serology tests were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either one of three vaccine formulations (3 µg with Algel-IMDG, 6 µg with Algel-IMDG, or 6 µg with Algel) or an Algel only control vaccine group. Block randomisation was done with a web response platform. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment group allocation. Two intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered on day 0 (the day of randomisation) and day 14. Primary outcomes were solicited local and systemic reactogenicity events at 2 h and 7 days after vaccination and throughout the full study duration, including serious adverse events. Secondary outcome was seroconversion (at least four-fold increase from baseline) based on wild-type virus neutralisation. Cell-mediated responses were evaluated by intracellular staining and ELISpot. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04471519). FINDINGS: Between July 13 and 30, 2020, 827 participants were screened, of whom 375 were enrolled. Among the enrolled participants, 100 each were randomly assigned to the three vaccine groups, and 75 were randomly assigned to the control group (Algel only). After both doses, solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were reported by 17 (17%; 95% CI 10·5-26·1) participants in the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG group, 21 (21%; 13·8-30·5) in the 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group, 14 (14%; 8·1-22·7) in the 6 µg with Algel group, and ten (10%; 6·9-23·6) in the Algel-only group. The most common solicited adverse events were injection site pain (17 [5%] of 375 participants), headache (13 [3%]), fatigue (11 [3%]), fever (nine [2%]), and nausea or vomiting (seven [2%]). All solicited adverse events were mild (43 [69%] of 62) or moderate (19 [31%]) and were more frequent after the first dose. One serious adverse event of viral pneumonitis was reported in the 6 µg with Algel group, unrelated to the vaccine. Seroconversion rates (%) were 87·9, 91·9, and 82·8 in the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG, 6 µg with Algel-IMDG, and 6 µg with Algel groups, respectively. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were detected in a subset of 16 participants from both Algel-IMDG groups. INTERPRETATION: BBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced immune responses. Both Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for phase 2 immunogenicity trials. Further efficacy trials are warranted.

Since January 2020, Taiwan has introduced both NPIs but their effectiveness on non-COVID-19 respiratory viruses (NCRVs) remain underexplored. METHODS: This retrospective observational study examined electronic records at a tertiary hospital in northern Taiwan from pre-COVID (January-December 2019) to post-COVID period (January-May 2020). Patients with respiratory syndromes were tested for both enveloped (eg, influenza virus and seasonal coronavirus) and non-enveloped RVs (eg, enterovirus and rhinovirus) using multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. Monthly positivity rates of NCRVs among adult and pediatric patients were analyzed with comparison between pre- and post-COVID periods. RESULTS: A total of 9693 patients underwent 12 127 multiplex RT-PCR tests. The average positivity rate of NCRVs reduced by 11.2% (25.6% to 14.4%) after nationwide PHIs. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the most commonly identified enveloped and non-enveloped viruses were influenza virus and enterovirus/rhinovirus, respectively. Observed reduction in NCRV incidence was predominantly contributed by enveloped NCRVs including influenza viruses. We did not observe epidemiological impacts of NPIs on non-enveloped viruses but an increasing trend in enterovirus/rhinovirus test positivity rate among pediatric patients. Our data were validated using Taiwan's national notification database. CONCLUSIONS: Our frontline investigation suggests that the current NPIs in Taiwan might not effectively control the transmission of non-enveloped respiratory viruses, despite their protective effects against influenza and seasonal coronavirus. Health authorities may consider using hydrogen peroxide or chloride-based disinfectants as additional preventative strategies against non-enveloped respiratory viruses in the post-COVID-19 era.","Chen, Andrew Po-Liang; Chu, Isaac Yen-Hao; Yeh, Mei-Lin; Chen, Yin-Yin; Lee, Chia-Lin; Lin, Hsiao-Hsuan; Chan, Yu-Jiun; Chen, Hsin-Pai",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,,585

But the statistical uncertainty attached to these forecasts, which is critical to their interpretation, is only improved marginally when new data on related series become available. That is particularly problematic in times of high economic uncertainty. As a solution this paper proposes to model common factors in scale and shape parameters alongside the mixed-frequency dynamic factor model typically used for location parameters in nowcasting frameworks. Scale and shape parameters control the time-varying dispersion and asymmetry round point forecasts which are necessary to capture the increase in variance and negative skewness found in times of recessions. It is shown how cross-sectional dependencies in scale and shape parameters may be modelled in mixed-frequency settings, with a particularly convenient approximation for scale parameters in Gaussian models. The benefit of this methodology is explored using vintages of U.S. economic growth data with a focus on the economic depression resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. The results show that modelling common factors in scale and shape parameters improves nowcasting performance towards the end of the nowcasting window in recessionary episodes.","Labonne, Paul",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02601v2.pdf,585

We aimed to establish an effective screening strategy in Shanghai, China, to aid early identification of patients with COVID-19. Methods: We did a multicentre, observational cohort study in fever clinics of 25 hospitals in 16 districts of Shanghai. All patients visiting the clinics within the study period were included. A strategy for COVID-19 screening was presented and then suspected cases were monitored and analysed until they were confirmed as cases or excluded. Logistic regression was used to determine the risk factors of COVID-19. Findings: We enrolled patients visiting fever clinics from Jan 17 to Feb 16, 2020. Among 53â617 patients visiting fever clinics, 1004 (1·9%) were considered as suspected cases, with 188 (0·4% of all patients, 18·7% of suspected cases) eventually diagnosed as confirmed cases. 154 patients with missing data were excluded from the analysis. Exposure history (odds ratio [OR] 4·16, 95% CI 2·74-6·33; p<0·0001), fatigue (OR 1·56, 1·01-2·41; p=0·043), white blood cell count less than 4â×â109 per L (OR 2·44, 1·28-4·64; p=0·0066), lymphocyte count less than 0·8â×â109 per L (OR 1·82, 1·00-3·31; p=0·049), ground glass opacity (OR 1·95, 1·32-2·89; p=0·0009), and having both lungs affected (OR 1·54, 1·04-2·28; p=0·032) were independent risk factors for confirmed COVID-19.

456084,Antithrombotic drugs with adjuvant action against COVID-19,2020,"Bacterial coinfection is associated with poor outcomes in patients with viral pneumonia, but data on its role in the mortality of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited. This is a single-center retrospective analysis of 242 patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to both intensive care and non-intensive care settings. Bacterial coinfection was determined by the presence of characteristic clinical features and positive culture results. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the association of concomitant bacterial infection with inpatient death after adjusting for demographic factors and comorbidities. Antibiotic use pattern was also determined. Bacterial coinfection was detected in 46 (19%) patients. Genitourinary source was the most frequent, representing 57% of all coinfections. The overall mortality rate was 21%. Concomitant bacterial infections were independently associated with increased inpatient mortality (OR, 5.838; 95% CI, 2.647-12.876). Patients with bacterial coinfection were relatively older (71.35 ± 11.20 vs 64.78 ± 15.23; P = .006). A total of 67% of patients received antibiotic therapy, yet 72% did not have an obvious source of bacterial infection. There was a significantly higher rate of inpatient mortality in patients who received antibiotics compared to those who did not (30% vs 5%; P < .0001). Bacterial coinfection in COVID-19 is associated with increased mortality.","Goncalves Mendes Neto, Alvaro; Lo, Kevin Bryan; Wattoo, Ammaar; Salacup, Grace; Pelayo, Jerald; DeJoy, Robert; Bhargav, Ruchika; Gul, Fahad; Peterson, Eric; Albano, Jeri; Patarroyo-Aponte, Gabriel; Rangaswami, Janani; Azmaiparashvili, Zurab",J. med. virol,,585
456253,A coming wave: suicide and gender after COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess anxiety and burnout levels, home life changes, and measures to relieve stress of U.S. academic emergency medicine (EM) physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic acceleration phase. METHODS: We sent a cross-sectional e-mail survey to all EM physicians at seven academic emergency departments. The survey incorporated items from validated stress scales and assessed perceptions and key elements in the following domains: numbers of suspected COVID-19 patients, availability of diagnostic testing, levels of home and workplace anxiety, severity of work burnout, identification of stressors, changes in home behaviors, and measures to decrease provider anxiety. RESULTS: A total of 426 (56.7%) EM physicians responded. On a scale of 1 to 7 (1 = not at all, 4 = somewhat, and 7 = extremely), the median (interquartile range) reported effect of the pandemic on both work and home stress levels was 5 (4-6). Reported levels of emotional exhaustion/burnout increased from a prepandemic median (IQR) of 3 (2-4) to since the pandemic started a median of 4 (3-6), with a difference in medians of 1.8 (95% confidence interval = 1.7 to 1.9). Most physicians (90.8%) reported changing their behavior toward family and friends, especially by decreasing signs of affection (76.8%). The most commonly cited measures cited to alleviate stress/anxiety were increasing personal protective equipment (PPE) availability, offering rapid COVID-19 testing at physician discretion, providing clearer communication about COVID-19 protocol changes, and assuring that physicians can take leave for care of family and self. CONCLUSIONS: During the acceleration phase, the COVID-19 pandemic has induced substantial workplace and home anxiety in academic EM physicians, and their exposure during work has had a major impact on their home lives. Measures cited to decrease stress include enhanced availability of PPE, rapid turnaround testing at provider discretion, and clear communication about COVID-19 protocol changes.","Rodriguez, Robert M; Medak, Anthony J; Baumann, Brigitte M; Lim, Stephen; Chinnock, Brian; Frazier, Remi; Cooper, Richelle J",Acad. emerg. med,,585

457496,Disease and healthcare burden of COVID-19 in the United States,2020,"Background: In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by a novel corona virus, health care personnel are at increased risk of acquiring the infection. In preparation for the management of health care personnel that are likely to be infected, we looked in to the data collected during the Influenza pandemic in 2009, caused by a novel strain of H1N1 influenza called swine flu. The care of healthcare personnel in our institution, who had an acute febrile respiratory illness (AFRI) during that period was routed through a single channel using a uniform protocol. We retrospectively analysed the available data, during the initial four months of the pandemic, to draw lessons from it. Objective: To study the prevalence, clinical profile and risk factors of swine flu among health care personnel during the pandemic of 2009 in a tertiary care hospital in South India. Methodology: This retrospective study enrolled all the health care personnel including students of a tertiary care institution in South India, who presented with an AFRI between June to August, the initial four months of the swine flu pandemic of 2009. The clinical profile and risk factors were extracted. The results of the RT PCR for swine flu was obtained. Prevalence in each demographic group was calculated and compared. Characteristics of those with swine flu were compared with those who turned negative for the swine flu. Results: The prevalence of all AFRI and only swine flu among health care personnel during the study period was 18 per thousand and 8.7 per thousand respectively. Highest prevalence of swine flu was found among students and office staff. After adjusting for confounding factors, hyperthermia at presentation was significantly higher {OR = 1.97; 95% CI (1.01–3.76)} among those who tested positive for swine flu as compared with those with other AFRI's. Only 2.5% of the entire AFRI group required admission and there was no mortality. Conclusion: Health care personnel are at increased risk of acquiring infection. Our study demonstrated that students and office staff were the most susceptible. Unprotected exposure to unknown infectious patients and relatives is likely to have been an important factor. Though the mode of transmission is similar, compared to H1N1, COVID-19 is associated with different comorbidities and has significantly higher mortality. Therefore, in preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic, the personal protective equipment of the healthcare personnel need to be escalated.","Isaac, Barney T.J.; Kirupakaran, Henry; Barney, Anitha M.; Christopher, Devasahayam J.",Indian J.

In this study, COVID-19 cases in India were critically analyzed during the pre-lockdown (PLD), lockdown (LD), and unlock (UL) phases. METHOD: Analyses were conducted using geospatial technology at district, state, and country levels, and comparisons were also made with other countries throughout the world that had the highest infection rates. India had the third highest infection rate in the world after the USA and Brazil during UL2.0-UL3.0 phases, the second highest after the USA during UL4.0-UL5.0 phases, and the highest among South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries in PLD-UL5.0 period. RESULTS: The trend in the number of COVID-19 cases was associated with the population density where higher numbers tended to be record in the eastern, southern, and west-central parts of India. The death rate in India throughout the pandemic period under study was lower than the global average. Kerala reported the maximum number of infections during PLD whereas Maharashtra had the highest numbers during all LD and UL phases. Eighty percent of the cases in India were concentrated mainly in highly populous districts. CONCLUSION: The top 25 districts accounted for 70.99%, 69.38%, 54.87%, 44.23%, 40.48%, and 38.96% of the infections from the start of UL1.0 until the end of UL phases, respectively, and the top 26-50 districts accounted for 6.38%, 6.76%, 11.23%, 12.98%, 13.40%, and 13.61% of cases in these phase, thereby indicating that COVID-19 cases spread during the UL period. By October 31, 2020, Delhi had the highest number of infections, followed by Bengaluru Urban, Pune, Mumbai, Thane, and Chennai. No decline in the infection rate occurred, even in UL5.0, thereby indicating a highly alarming situation in India.","Gangwar, Hari Shankar; Ray, P K Champati",Int J Infect Dis,,585

We aimed to assess an intervention to deal with the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on the operations of a rapid response team (RRT). INITIAL ASSESSMENT: An observational study with medical record review, was carried out at a large tertiary care hospital in Fortaleza, a 400-bed quaternary hospital, 96 of which are ICU beds. All adult patients admitted to hospital wards, treated by the RRTs during the study period, were included, and a total of 15,461 RRT calls were analyzed. CHOICE OF SOLUTION: Adequacy of workforce sizing. IMPLEMENTATION: The hospital adjusted the size of its RRTs during the period, going from 2 to 4 simultaneous on-duty medical professionals. EVALUATION: After the beginning of the pandemic, the number of treated cases in general went from an average of 30.6 daily calls to 79.2, whereas the extremely critical cases went from 3.5 to 22 on average. In percentages, the extremely critical care cases went from 10.47 to 20%, with p <0.001. Patient mortality remained unchanged. The number of critically-ill cases and the number of treated patients increased two-fold in relation to the pre-pandemic period, but the effectiveness of the RRT in relation to mortality was not affected. LESSONS LEARNED: The observation of these data is important for hospital managers to adjust the size of their RRTs according to the new scenario, aiming to maintain the intervention effectiveness.","Rocha, Hermano Alexandre Lima; Alcântara, Antonia Célia de Castro; Netto, Fernanda Colares de Borba; Ibiapina, Flavio Lucio Pontes; Lopes, Livia Amaral; Rocha, Sabrina Gabriele Maia Oliveira; Leite, Elias Bezerra",Int. j. qual. health care,,585

460923,COVID-19: How nurse managers are dealing with the psychological toll of the pandemic,2020,"IntroductionAntiandrogen are good candidates against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) due to the inhibition of its entry into host cells by the suppression of TMPRSS2, an enzyme that primes the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and is key for its cell entry. Proxalutamide is a second-generation nonsteroidal anti-androgen (NSAA) with strong activities on androgen receptor (AR) antagonism, suppression of AR nuclear expression, and downregulation of the membrane-attached angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). The efficacy of proxalutamide was previously demonstrated for early COVID-19 patients, and has now demonstrated efficacy to reduce deaths in hospitalized COVID-19 patient in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT). Whether radiological changes would follow the improvement in clinical outcomes with proxalutamide is not established. The present post-hoc analysis aims to evaluate whether proxalutamide improves lung injury observed through chest computerized tomography (CT) scans, in addition to the clinical improvement, thus providing further objective evidence of the drug response in COVID-19. MethodsThis is a post-hoc analysis of the radiological findings of a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective, two-arm RCT (The Proxa-Rescue AndroCoV Trial) with all enrolled patients from the three participating institutions of the city of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil, that had at least two chest CT scans during hospitalization. The quantification of lung parenchyma involvement was performed by independent board-certified radiologists with expertise in analysis of COVID-19 images, that were blind to the assigned intervention in the RCT. A first chest CT scan was performed upon randomization and a second CT scan was performed approximately five days later, whenever patient transportation was feasible. ResultsOf the 395 patients initially evaluated, 72 and 179 patients from the proxalutamide and placebo arms, respectively, were included (n=251). Baseline and clinical characteristics, interval between first and second chest CT scans, and percentage of lung parenchyma affected in the baseline chest CT scan were similar between groups. In the second chest CT scan, the percentage of lungs affected (Median - IQR) was 35.0% (25.0-57.5%) in the proxalutamide group versus 67.5% (50.0-80.0%) in the placebo group (p < 0.001). The absolute and relative change between the second and first chest CT scans (Median - IQR) were -15.0 percent points (p.p.) (-30.0 - 0.0p.p.) and -25.0% (-50.0 - 0.0%) in the proxalutamide group, respectively, and +15.0p.p. (0.0 - +30.0p.p.) and +32.7% (0.0 - +80.0%) in the placebo group, respectively (p < 0.001 for both absolute and relative changes). ConclusionProxalutamide improves lung opacities in hospitalized COVID-19 patients when compared to placebo.

As this method of education continues to be widely used, understanding the current trend of its usage is critical. In this study, we performed a survey study of virtual lecture attendees and presenters to determine current usage and general consensus on virtual lectures in plastic surgery education. METHODS: An electronic survey was sent to attendees and presenters of virtual lectures using Google Forms. Demographic data, webinar usage patterns, and views on virtual lectures were collected. RESULTS: A total of 417 surveys were received. Prior to the COVID-19 era, 39.1percent of attendees did not use virtual lectures and 45.6percent of presenters did not give webinars at all. Both groups reported that the lack of opportunities and need were the most common cause of no use of lectures or webinars. After the outbreak, 35.4percent of attendees now use virtual lectures daily and 51.4percent of presenters give lectures weekly. Over 90percent of the study population reported a positive experience with the virtual lectures due to increased interaction, convenience, outreach, and usability. Finally, over 75percent stated that virtual lectures might replace classroom lectures in the future. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that a majority of plastic surgeons have begun to use and give virtual lectures daily after the COVID-19 outbreak. Virtual education is a powerful and versatile tool that has great potentials, and it may continue to serve as a part of surgical training in the future.","Cho, Min-Jeong; Hong, Joon Pio",J. plast. reconstr. aesthet. surg,,585

461292,COVID-19 and dental practice_ Overview and protocols during pandemic/ COVID-19 e odontoiatria: Generalità e protocolli durante la pandemia,2020,"Background Scalp hair loss (alopecia) in women is a common ageing and senescing condition. It usually presents as androgenetic alopecia (AGA) or telogen effluvium (TE) and often has pronounced psychological consequences. ALRV5XR is a novel treatment aiming to regenerate a normal hair phenotype by targeting multiple molecular pathways linked to hair growth promotion and hair follicle stem cell activation. The primary objectives of this 24-week trial were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ALRV5XR in terminal hair (TH) regrowth in women with AGA or TE. Methods This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed in a USA community clinic. Healthy women 18-65 years of age with AGA or TE of Ludwig classification I-II and Fitzpatrick skin type I-VI were enrolled. They were allocated in a 1:1 ratio into ALRV5XR or placebo treatment groups using a random number table. Masked dermatologist assessments, phototrichograms and blood samples were obtained at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks. Subjects were given a masked treatment regimen of oral capsules, shampoo, conditioner and follicle serum for daily administration. Main outcomes were absolute and per cent changes in TH density and response rates. The trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04450602) and is completed. Findings 46 subjects (23 ALRV5XR, 23 placebo) were enrolled between April 3 and October 20, 2018. Five subjects dropped out and two were non-compliant. Thirty-nine subjects completed the trial (18 ALRV5XR, 21 placebo). At 24 weeks, the absolute change in TH density improved by 30·1THs/cm2 (95% CI: 15·1–45·1;p=0·0002), and the relative density increased by 19·7% (95% CI: 8·0%–31·4%;p=0·0016). The odds ratio for being a responder (≥0 change) was 2·7. Efficacy increased 133% from week 12 to 24. Efficacy outcomes were similar in AGA and TE subjects. 66·7% of the ALRV5XR group responded by regrowing 40THs/cm2 or more hair. No adverse events were reported. Interpretation In women with AGA or TE, ALRV5XR treatment significantly increased hair regrowth without adverse events. ALRV5XR displayed a multi-fold improved efficacy and response rate when compared to published trials of standard therapy. Progressive acceleration of TH regrowth suggests regeneration of the structure and function of non-productive telogen follicles and prolonged treatment may restore a normal hair phenotype.","Feldman, Peter R.; Fiebig, Klaus M.; Piwko, Charles Mints Boris M.; Brown, Dennis Cahan Deborah J.; Guevara-Aguirre, Jaime",EClinicalMedicine,,585

METHODS AND MATERIAL: COVID-19 patients were prospectively followed up with pulmonary function tests and clinical characteristics for 3â months following discharge from a hospital in Wuhan, China between January and February 2020. RESULTS: 647 patients were included. 87 (13%) patients presented with weakness, 63 (10%) with palpitation and 56 (9%) with dyspnea. Prevalences of the three symptoms were markedly higher in severe patients than non-severe patients (19% versus 10% for weakness, p=0.003; 14% versus 7% for palpitation, p=0.007; 12% versus 7% for dyspnea, p=0.014). Results of multivariable regression showed an increased odd in the ongoing symptoms among severe patients (OR: 1.7, 95%CI: 1.1-2.6, p=0.026) or patients with longer hospital stay (OR: 1.03, 95%CI: 1.00-1.05, p=0.041). Pulmonary function test results were available for 81 patients, including 41 non-severe and 40 severe patients. In this subgroup, 44 (54%) patients manifested abnormal diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (68% severe versus 42% non-severe patients, p=0.019). Chest CT total severity score (TSS)>10.5 (OR: 10.4; 95%CI: 2.5-44.1; p=0.001) on admission and ARDS (OR: 4.6; 95%CI: 1.4-15.5; p=0.014) were significantly associated with impaired DLCO. Pulmonary interstitial damage may be associated with abnormal DLCO. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary function, particularly DLCO, declined in COVID-19 survivors. This decrease was associated with TSS of chest CT >10.5 and ARDS occurrence. Pulmonary interstitial damage might contribute to the imparied DLCO.","Qin, Wei; Chen, Shi; Zhang, Yunxia; Dong, Fen; Zhang, Zhu; Hu, Bingzhu; Zhu, Ziyang; Li, Fajiu; Wang, Xiaojiang; Wang, Yimin; Zhen, Kaiyuan; Wang, Jing; Wan, YuLei; Li, Hongbo; Elalamy, Ismaïl; Li, Chenghong; Zhai, Zhenguo; Wang, Chen",Eur. respir. j,,585

Consequently, being able to accurately predict appropriate linear B-cell epitope regions would pave the way for the development of new protein-based vaccines. Knowing how much confidence there is in a prediction is also essential for gaining clinicians' trust in the technology. In this article, we propose a calibrated uncertainty estimation in deep learning to approximate variational Bayesian inference using MC-DropWeights to predict epitope regions using the data from the immune epitope database. Having applied this onto SARS-CoV-2, it can more reliably predict B-cell epitopes than standard methods. This will be able to identify safe and effective vaccine candidates against Covid-19.","Ghoshal, Bhargab; Ghoshal, Biraja; Swift, Stephen; Tucker, Allan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.11214v1.pdf,585

Increasing evidence suggests that COVID-19 associated adverse outcomes mainly rely on dysregulated immunity. Here, we compared transcriptomic profiles of blood cells from 103 patients with different severity levels of COVID-19 with that of 27 healthy and 22 influenza-infected individuals. Data provided a complete overview of SARS-CoV-2-induced immune signature, including a dramatic defect in IFN responses, a reduction of toxicity-related molecules in NK cells, an increased degranulation of neutrophils, a dysregulation of T cells, a dramatic increase in B cell function and immunoglobulin production, as well as an important over-expression of genes involved in metabolism and cell cycle in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to those infected with influenza viruses. These features also differed according to COVID-19 severity. Overall and specific gene expression patterns across groups can be visualized on an interactive website (https://bix.unil.ch/covid/).

The total number of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rising daily and no vaccine has yet been approved. While the pathophysiology behind the virus is still being studied, many possible several risk factors using small sample sizes have been found. Material and methods: We conducted a pooled analysis using several databases such as Medline, Scopus, Wangfang, Web of Science, Research Square, medrxiv, and Google Scholar to identify studies reporting severe and non-severe groups of COVID-19 patients. The odds ratios as well as the 95% confidence intervals for hypertension, diabetes, and cerebrovascular disease leading to severe COVID-19 were calculated using R-software. Results: Fifty-three articles were used for our analysis and they involved 30,935 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from several countries across the world. The odds ratio for severe COVID-19 in hypertensive patients, diabetics, and patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease was 2.58 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.16-3.08, from 53 studies), 2.17 (95% CI: 1.72-2.74, from 44 studies), and 2.63 (95% CI: 1.80-3.85, from 25 studies), respectively. Conclusions: Our analysis confirms that patients with hypertension, diabetes, or cerebrovascular disease are at a higher risk of a severe outcome of COVID-19. It is thus vital for physicians to identify the main risk factors for a severe outcome of this disease.","Ramphul, K.; Lohana, P.; Ramphul, Y.; Park, Y.; Mejias, S.; Dhillon, B.

The standard assessment of such a pathology happens via tests that are usually performed on paper. However, a great interest toward digital solutions for USN is arising, in order to facilitate the activities of medical specialists. Furthermore, the recent outbreak of COVID-19 is stressing the importance of remote assistive tools which enable the continuity of care at patient's home. Indeed, connected technology allows for remote monitoring of patients by the clinical staff, hence enabling the definition of a personalized plan of care even after the de-hospitalization and in safe conditions. In addition, USN patients are among the so-called fragile subjects who, due to their condition, require continuous monitoring and rehabilitative therapeutic intervention, which can be granted by some ICT solution. The present work introduces the battery of tests for the assessment of USN which are included in the ReMoVES system. They are digital versions of standard tests that can be practiced via a touchscreen. The informative content that such activities deliver is wider and more comprehensive than the paper based versions. The experimental phase is described with respect to the well-known Albert's test, in a real-life scenario.

The novel member of Coronaviridae causing COVID-19 disease is named as SARS-Cov-2. Its first case was reported in China by the end of 2019, but its exponential spread has wrapped entire globe, suspended and is penalizing mankind. A retrospective meta-analysis study showed that outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and SARS-Cov-1 (Coronaviridae), influenza infection H1N1 and West-African Ebola caused lower mortality than this new pandemic COVID-19. Virus has appeared as a new human pathogen so to counter COVID-19 no specific vaccine, monoclonal antibodies have been manufactured till day. The outbreak of novel Coronavirus is treated with antimicrobial drugs but they have their own mild side effects. But the drastic spread of COVID-19 compels us also to use other ways to counter pandemic. Thus, passive immunization can be opted to hold back this mysterious virus. Passive immunization has been in use since early 20th century and showed its effectiveness against all previous infectious outbreaks including MERS and SARS-Cov-1 members of Coronaviridae.

For example, pneumonia is a clinical diagnosis of lung infection that may be caused by viral, bacterial, fungal, or other pathogens. The study of pneumonia etiology is challenging because directly sampling from the lung to identify the etiologic pathogen is not standard clinical practice in most settings. Instead, measurements from multiple peripheral specimens are made. This paper introduces the statistical methodology designed for estimating the population etiology distribution and the individual etiology probabilities in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study of 9; 500 children for 7 sites around the world. We formulate the scientific problem in statistical terms as estimating the mixing weights and latent class indicators under a partially-latent class model (pLCM) that combines heterogeneous measurements with different error rates obtained from a case-control study. We introduce the pLCM as an extension of the latent class model. We also introduce graphical displays of the population data and inferred latent-class frequencies. The methods are tested with simulated data, and then applied to PERCH data. The paper closes with a brief description of extensions of the pLCM to the regression setting and to the case where conditional independence among the measures is relaxed.","Wu, Zhenke; Deloria-Knoll, Maria; Hammitt, Laura L.; Zeger, Scott L.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.5774v1.pdf,585

This is a novel coronavirus; much is unknown as to how it will affect people with IBD. We also lack information about the impact of different immunosuppressive medications. To address this uncertainty, the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) COVID-19 IBD Working Group has used the best available data and expert opinion to generate a risk grid that groups patients into highest, moderate and lowest risk categories. This grid allows patients to be instructed to follow the UK government's advice for shielding, stringent and standard advice regarding social distancing, respectively.

464874,Covid-19 and social stigma: Role of scientific community,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic infection with profound effects on human society, has been emerged recently and rigorously challenged our ability to control viral infections. Although at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, the epidemic seems controllable in Southern Iran, the disease presents a critical pattern as of May 2020. After a few months of COVID-19 emergence, in a twisted turn of events, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 increased dramatically. It has been proposed that the antibodies obtained from previous exposure to local circulating human coronaviruses or possibly SARS-CoV-2 might contribute to the development of more severe and lethal presentations of COVID-19 possibly by triggering antibody-dependent enhancement. The binding of virions complexed with antibodies to FcÎ³ receptors on the target cells initiates receptor-mediated signaling events leading to enhanced expression of inflammatory cytokines and suppression of intracellular antiviral responses at the transcriptomic level, followed by endocytosis of the virus and subsequent activation of immune cells. The activated immune cells might accumulate in the lung and promote cytokine storm and lymphopenia. Furthermore, the formation of immune complexes can promote complement activation and subsequent tissue damage. Although there are currently no clinical data to support this hypothesis, a better understanding of these immunopathologic phenomena and their relation to disease course and severity might give insight into the development of the most efficient prophylactic and therapeutic approaches. This review demonstrates the critical pattern of COVID-19 in Southern Iran and highlights the possible interplaying factors leading to this condition.","Farshadpour, Fatemeh; Taherkhani, Reza",,,585

466532,Imagining extinction inside viral body without organs,2021,"There is broad empirical evidence of regime switching in financial markets. The transition between different market regimes is mirrored in correlation matrices, whose time-varying coefficients usually jump higher in highly volatile regimes, leading to the failure of common diversification methods. In this article, we aim to identify market regimes from covariance matrices and detect transitions towards highly volatile regimes, hence improving tail-risk hedging. Starting from the time series of fractionally differentiated sentiment-like future values, two models are applied on monthly realized covariance matrices to detect market regimes. Specifically, the regime detection is implemented via vector logistic smooth transition autoregressive model (VLSTAR) and through an unsupervised learning methodology, the agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Since market regime switches are unobservable processes that describe the latent change of market behaviour, the ability of correctly detecting market regimes is validated in two ways: firstly, randomly generated data are used to assess a correct classification when regimes are known; secondly, a na\""{i}ve trading strategy filtered with the detected regime switches is used to understand whether an improvement is showed when accounting for regime switches. The results point to the VLSTAR as the best performing model for labelling market regimes.","Bucci, Andrea; Ciciretti, Vito",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03667v1.pdf,585

467302,Redefining proximity framework in non specialized open markets using buyers location coordinates for nearest seller identification: An immediate open market response to covid 19 realities,2020,"Coronaviruses are dangerous human and animal pathogens. The newly identified coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19 outbreak, which is a real threat to human health and life. The world has been struggling with this epidemic for about a year, yet there are still no targeted drugs and effective treatments are very limited. Due to the long process of developing new drugs, reposition of existing ones is one of the best ways to deal with an epidemic of emergency infectious diseases. Among the existing drugs there are candidates which are potentially able to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 replication, and thus infection with the virus. Some therapeutics target several proteins, and many diseases share molecular paths. In such cases, the use of existing pharmaceuticals for more than one purposes can reduce the time needed to design new drugs. The aim of this review was to analyse the key targets of viral infection and potential drugs acting on them, as well as to discuss various strategies and therapeutic approaches, including the possible use of natural products. We highlight the approach based on increasing the involvement of human deaminases, particularly APOBEC deaminases in editing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This can reduce the cytosine content in the viral genome leading to the loss of its integrity. We also indicate the nucleic acid technologies as potential approaches for COVID-19 treatment. Among numerous promising natural products, we point out curcumin and cannabidiol as good candidates for being anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents.","Pluskota-Karwatka, Donata; Hoffmann, Marcin; Barciszewski, Jan",,,585

We therefore conducted a survey to explore these issues. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we interviewed 226 PWUD from three Norwegian cities in May/June 2020. Participants completed an interview-administrated questionnaire. Three separate multiple binary logistic regression models were estimated with the outcomes (no/yes): 1. Familiarity with COVID-19 symptoms, 2. Awareness of COVID-19 services tailored towards PWUD and, 3. Willingness to take a COVID-19 test. RESULTS: The mean age was 44.1 years and 73 % were males. Fifty-four percent were injectors, and heroin/other opioids (35.8 %) and cocaine/amphetamine (25.2 %) were the most common main drugs used. Overall, 54.9 % were in opioid maintenance treatment (OMT). The majority (65.9 %) stated they knew the COVID-19 symptoms. Almost all the participants (91.2 %) reported they would take a COVID-19 test if experiencing relevant symptoms. The majority (63.7 %) were not aware of COVID-19 services available to PWUD. OMT patients were more likely to be familiar with COVID-19 symptoms (aOR = 3.4, 95 % CI 1.7; 6.8), and to be aware of COVID-19 services (aOR = 2.7, 95 % CI 1.1; 6.3). Overall, 35.4 % reported reduced drug availability, mainly for tranquilizers, while 61.5 % reported increased drug prices, mainly for cannabis. CONCLUSION: Drug treatment may play an important role in COVID-19 prevention, as those in OMT were more likely to be aware of symptoms and of availability of services.","Welle-Strand, Gabrielle K; Skurtveit, Svetlana; Clausen, Thomas; Sundal, Christine; Gjersing, Linn",Drug Alcohol Depend,,585

The rate constant of CoO+ + CO is (1.5 ± 0.4) × 10-10 × (T/300 K)-0.7±0.2 cm3 s-1 is in disagreement with a previously reported upper limit of 10-13 cm3 s-1, with the discrepancy likely due to the earlier report having studied the reactions in tandem. The reaction of Co+ + N2O produces CoO+ with a much smaller rate constant of 1.4 ± 0.4 × 10-12 cm3 s-1 at 300 K. The association product, Co(N2O)+, was also produced with a rate constant of 1.6 × 10-28 cm6 s-1. While the rate constant for termolecular association decreased with temperature in accordance with a decreasing time scale for stabilization, the production of CoO+ increased with temperature in a manner that is not well described by simple functional forms.

This was accompanied by an increase in hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin prescriptions until the end of March, followed by a decrease leading to the disappearance of these two medications in April. The pharmaceutical analysis of the prescriptions resulted in 59 PIs of which 21 were associated with lopinavir/ritonavir, 32 with hydroxychloroquine and 6 with azithromycin. Regarding the medication-related problems, the most frequent ones were incorrect treatment durations (n=32 (54.2%)), drug interactions with potential torsadogenic reactions (n=14 (23.7%)) and incorrect dosing (n=6 (10.2%)). From the 59 PIs, 48 (81.4%) were accepted and physicians adjusted the medication regimens in a timely manner. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the value-even more meaningful in a crisis situation-of a strong synergy between physicians and pharmacists for patient-safety focused practices.","Gourieux, Benedicte; Reisz, Fanny; Belmas, Anne Sophie; Danion, François; Fourtage, Marion; Nai, Thierry; Reiter-Schatz, Aurélie; Ruch, Yvon; Walther, Julia; Nivoix, Yasmine; Michel, Bruno",,,585

METHODS: Prospective analysis of data obtained from 60 diabetic patients in 2020 was performed at Cantonal Hospital Zenica, Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Personal protection equipment included double surgical mask, glasses, disposable surgical coats, and surgical masks for patients. Swabs were used to take samples from wounds. We randomly divided patients in 2 groups of 30 patients each. In pre-operative treatment, we used local anesthesia lidocaine hydrochloride 2% (Belupo, Koprivnica, Croatia) in group A and systemic analgesia intravenous tramadol chloride 100 mg intravenous (Krka, Novo Mesto, Slovenia) in group B. Wounds were surgically treated each day and heal spontaneously. Periodical control exams were performed. RESULTS: Wound healing did not present any statistically significant differences between groups (group A: 69±21.97 and B: 61±22.13 days, t=-1.22; p=0.11). No statistically significant differences (p<0.05) between groups A and B in wound healing regarding to gender or cigarette use was noted.

470510,The distributional impact of Covid-19: Geographic variation in mortality in England,2021,"Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is becoming popular for treating phobia and anxiety disorder. The recent pandemic of COVID-19 not only causes infection per se but also has an impact on mental health. This case series aimed to explore the role of VRET in the intervention of psychiatric illnesses with chief complaints of fear of COVID-19 infection. In vivo exposure therapy for fear of COVID-19 infection is not possible due to the risk of virus infection; in this scenario, the VRET provides an immersive experience and can act as adjunctive therapy for treating phobias and anxiety disorders arising due to novel coronavirus pandemic. Clinical presentation and findings as well as management and procedures of VRET are discussed. Medical record of three patients (two male and one female) at the Shenzhen Mental Health Center (Shenzhen Kangning Hospital), China, was included in the present case series. Patients were assessed with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and Fear of COVID-19 Scale to measure anxiety and fear, respectively. Throughout VRET sessions, we gradually and systematically exposed the patient to virtual COVID-19 scenarios (for example, touching stained door handle which may have viruses, watching pandemic news, watching frontline health care workers, etc.). In our study, VRET intervention significantly reduced the related symptoms caused by fear of COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, virtual reality can provide relevant theoretical and practical support for exploring the remote psychological counseling of patients in isolation wards.","Zhang, Wanling; Paudel, Dhirendra; Shi, Rui; Liang, Jie; Liu, Jingwen; Zeng, Xiansheng; Zhou, Yunfei; Zhang, Bin",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,,585
470647,Economic Value of Treatment and Vaccine to Address the COVID-19 Pandemic: A US Cost-Effectiveness and Budget Impact Analysis,2020,"COVID-19 has intensified into a global pandemic with over a million deaths worldwide. Experimental research analyses have been implemented and executed with the sole rationale to counteract SARS-CoV-2, which has initiated potent therapeutic strategy development in coherence with computational biology validation focusing on the characterized viral drug targets signified by proteomic and genomic data. Spike glycoprotein is one of such potential drug target that promotes viral attachment to the host cellular membrane by binding to its receptor ACE-2 via its Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD). Multiple Sequence alignment and relative phylogenetic analysis revealed significant sequential disparities of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to previously encountered SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV strains. We implemented a drug re-purposing approach wherein the inhibitory efficacy of a cluster of thirty known drug candidates comprising of antivirals, antibiotics and phytochemicals (selection contingent on their present developmental status in underway clinical trials) was elucidated by subjecting them to molecular docking analyses against the spike protein RBD model (developed using homology modelling and validated using SAVES server 5.0) and the composite trimeric structures of spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Our results indicated that Camostat, Favipiravir, Tenofovir, Raltegravir and Stavudine showed significant interactions with spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Proficient bioavailability coupled with no predicted in silico toxicity rendered them as prospective alternatives for designing and development of novel combinatorial therapy formulations for improving existing treatment regimes to combat COVID-19.","Toor, Himanshu G; Banerjee, Devjani I; Lipsa Rath, Soumya; Darji, Siddhi A",Eur J Pharmacol,,585

I find that only a tenth of the transients were spectrally classified. This severe""bottleneck""problem should concern astronomers and also funding agencies. The bottleneck will get worse by a factor of 20 (or more) once LSST comes on line. We need to fundamentally rethink the purpose of surveys for transients. Here, after undertaking a detailed investigation of this issue I offer some solutions. Going forward, astronomers will employ two different methodologies: (1) multi-band photometric method which is well suited to the study of very large, many tens of thousands, samples of faint transients; (2) spectral classifications of thousands of bright transients found in shallow and nightly cadenced wide-field photometry surveys and transients associated with galaxies in the local Universe. The latter program, in addition to unearthing new types of transients and offering astronomers opportunities to undertake extensive follow up of interesting transients, is needed to set the stage for the former. Specifically, I suggest a globally coordinated effort to spectrally classify a complete sample of bright supernovae (<~19.5 mag) and transients within the local Universe (<200 Mpc) The proposed program is within reach -- thanks to the on-going wide-field surveys, the development of novel spectrographs tuned for classification, great improvements in throughput of spectrographs and the increasing availability of robotic telescopes.","Kulkarni, S.

The underrepresented minorities, where the prevalence of obesity is higher, appear to be affected disproportionately. Our objectives were to assess the characteristics and early outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Bronx and investigate whether obesity is associated with worse outcomes independently from age, gender and other comorbidities. METHODS: This retrospective study included the first 200 patients admitted to a tertiary medical center with COVID-19. The electronic medical records were reviewed at least three weeks after admission. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: 200 patients were included (female sex: 102, African American: 102). The median BMI was 30â¯kg/m2. The median age was 64â¯years. Hypertension (76%), hyperlipidemia (46.2%), and diabetes (39.5%) were the three most common comorbidities. Fever (86%), cough (76.5%), and dyspnea (68%) were the three most common symptoms. 24% died during hospitalization (BMIâ¯<â¯25â¯kg/m2: 31.6%, BMI 25-34â¯kg/m2: 17.2%, BMIâ¯&#8805;â¯35â¯kg/m2: 34.8%, pâ¯=â¯0.03). Increasing age (analyzed in quartiles), male sex, BMIâ¯&#8805;â¯35â¯kg/m2 (reference: BMI 25-34â¯kg/m2), heart failure, CAD, and CKD or ESRD were found to have a significant univariate association with mortality. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that BMIâ¯&#8805;â¯35â¯kg/m2 (reference: BMI 25-34â¯kg/m2, OR: 3.78; 95% CI: 1.45-9.83; pâ¯=â¯0.006), male sex (OR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.25-5.98; pâ¯=â¯0.011) and increasing age (analyzed in quartiles, OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.13-2.63; pâ¯=â¯0.011) were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality. Similarly, age, male sex, BMIâ¯&#8805;â¯35â¯kg/m2 and current or prior smoking were significant predictors for increasing oxygenation requirements in the multivariate analysis, while male sex, age and BMIâ¯&#8805;â¯35â¯kg/m2 were significant predictors in the multivariate analysis for the outcome of intubation. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a minority-predominant population, severe obesity, increasing age, and male sex were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality and in general worse in-hospital outcomes.","Palaiodimos, Leonidas; Kokkinidis, Damianos G; Li, Weijia; Karamanis, Dimitrios; Ognibene, Jennifer; Arora, Shitij; Southern, William N; Mantzoros, Christos S",Metabolism,,585

The responses to this challenge when it comes to celebrating the Eucharist have been multiple. Frequent pastoral responses have included the shipping of consecrated elements to folk for their use during live-stream worship and virtual communion, in which worshippers employ elements from their own households as communion elements during the digitized worship. These options are not permitted for Roman Catholics. Instead, it is most common for Roman Catholics to be invited into spiritual communion. This is often considered a diminished, even ternary form of communing, quickly dispensed when quarantines are lifted and herd immunity achieved. On the other hand, there is a rich and thoughtful tradition about spiritual communion that recognizes it as an essential element in communion even when such is experienced face-to-face. This article intends to affirm the values of spiritual communion as a real, mystical and fruitful action that not only sustains people worshipping from afar, but enhances an authentic eucharistic spirituality.","Foley, Edward",Religions,,585

In Spain, the tourism sector is of major economic importance, becoming one of the most vulnerable countries when crisis affects this industry. The negative image of the country due to the high infection rates has had a negative impact on travel and tourism. The Balearic Islands have been the most affected region with an 87% decrease in tourist visitors. The trips made by Spanish residents inside the Spanish territory shows the first increase found in the series analyzed. Domestic tourism not only represents an opportunity for all regions in this critical situation, but the types of accommodation also play a key role.","Moreno-Luna, Libertad; Robina-Ramírez, Rafael; Sánchez, Marcelo Sánchez-Oro; Castro-Serrano, José",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,585

Retrospective clinical studies show a correlation between exposure to anaesthesia during infancy and the occurrence of learning disorders (LD). Prospective studies failed to detect any influence of a single exposure to anaesthesia on neurodevelopment. We hypothesised that some specific populations of children were electively sensitive to anaesthesia-related neurotoxicity. METHODS: Using a case-control design, we analysed the medical histories of children with LD, compared to those of their normally reading siblings. Interviews were conducted and medical records were reviewed. The numbers of hospitalisations and anaesthesia exposures before the age of five years were determined. RESULTS: Four hundred fourteen dyslexic children were screened over a one-year period. Two hundred and seventy patients were excluded due to confounding variables (single child, all siblings showing LD or any condition placing the neurological prognosis at risk (N = 107/414 for the latter)) or inability to accurately collect evaluation criteria. In the 144 case-control pairs studied, the mean number of hospitalisations was significantly different (N = 1.097 ± 0 .135/case versus 0.667 ± 0.097/control, p = 0.0052), as was the proportion of hospitalised patients (54.2% versus 38.9%, p = 0.0031). The mean number of anaesthesia exposures per individual was not statistically different (N = 0.958 ± 0.183/case versus 0.569 ± 0.107/control, p = 0.0732), but the proportion of children anaesthetised at least once was (43.8% (cases) versus 33.3% (controls), p = 0.0301). DISCUSSION: One or more hospitalisation(s) may reflect a health status and/or have an iatrogenic effect disrupting the normal setting up of learning abilities. Anaesthesia may play a role, but a correlation between LD and anaesthesia is of a lower magnitude than between LD and hospitalisation.","Laudenbach, Vincent; Charollais, Aude; Radi, Sophie; Stumpf, Marie-Hélène; Vincent, Anne; Kaltwasser, Ingrid; Tomczyk, Tiphaine; Benichou, Jacques; Leroux, Philippe; Marret, Stéphane",Anaesth.

We derive here an analytical expression for the effectiveness of contact-tracing app installation strategies in a SIR model on a given contact graph. We propose a decentralised heuristic to improve the effectiveness of contact tracing under fixed adoption rates, which targets a set of individuals to install contact-tracing apps, and can be easily implemented. Simulations on a large number of real-world contact networks confirm that this heuristic represents a feasible alternative to the current state of the art.","Bassolas, Aleix; Santoro, Andrea; Sousa, Sandro; Rognone, Silvia; Nicosia, Vincenzo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.13013v1.pdf,585
475048,Re: COVID-19: Lessons from the Italian Reproductive Medical Experience,2020,"Most bacteria naturally release spherical lipid-bilayered extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing proteins, nucleic acids, and virulence-related molecules, thus contributing to diverse biological functions including transport of virulence factors. The group A streptococcus, Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS), a major human pathogen, also releases EVs; however, it remains unclear how GAS EVs interact physiologically and pathologically with host cells, and what the differences are between invasive and non-invasive strains. The proteome profile in this study revealed that GAS EVs enclosed many virulence-related proteins such as streptolysin O and NAD-glycohydrolase, facilitating their pathogenicity, and invasive GAS EVs were more abundant than non-invasive counterparts. In terms of biological effects, invasive GAS EVs showed slo-dependent cytotoxic activity and the induction of cytokine expression, contributing to GAS pathogenicity directly. Although non-invasive GAS EVs did not show cytotoxic activity, they may be utilized as a means to prevent antibacterial mechanisms such as autophagy, leading to enhancement of their own survival in the intracellular environment after the infection. These results suggest that invasive and non-invasive GAS EVs play different roles in GAS infection strategy and pathogenicity. Our findings also indicate that EVs could be a key factor for GAS pathogenicity in GAS-host interactions.","Murase, Kazunori; Aikawa, Chihiro; Nozawa, Takashi; Nakatake, Ayako; Sakamoto, Kuniyo; Kikuchi, Taisei; Nakagawa, Ichiro",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,585

Patients who received propofol for <12 hours, were transferred from an outside hospital while on mechanical ventilation, or did not have a triglyceride concentration obtained during the infusion were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 252 patients were included. Hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglyceride concentration &#8805; 400 mg/dL) occurred in 38.9% of patients after a median cumulative dose of 4307 mg (interquartile range [IQR], 2448-9431 mg). The median time to triglyceride elevation was 3.8 days (IQR, 1.9-9.1 days). In the multivariable regression analysis, obese patients had a significantly greater odds of hypertriglyceridemia (odds ratio = 1.87; 95% CI = 1.10, 3.21). There was no occurrence of acute pancreatitis. The incidence of possible propofol-related infusion syndrome was 3.2%. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Hypertriglyceridemia occurred frequently in patients with COVID-19 who received propofol but did not lead to acute pancreatitis. Elevated triglyceride concentrations occurred more often and at lower cumulative doses than previously reported in patients without COVID-19. Application of these data may aid in optimal monitoring for serious adverse effects of propofol in patients with COVID-19.","Witenko, Corey J; Littlefield, Audrey J; Abedian, Sajjad; An, Anjile; Barie, Philip S; Berger, Karen",Ann Pharmacother,,585

476252,Blocking information on COVID-19 can fuel the spread of misinformation,2020,"Activation of TLR7 by small imidazoquinoline molecules such as R848 or R837 initiates signaling cascades leading to the activation of transcription factors, such as AP-1, NF-&#954;B, and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and afterward to the induction of cytokines and anti-viral Type I IFNs. In general, TLRs mediate these effects by utilizing different intracellular signaling molecules, one of them is Mal. Mal is a protein closely related to the antibacterial response, and its role in the TLR7 pathways remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that Mal determines the expression and secretion of IFNß following activation of TLR7, a receptor that recognizes ssRNA and imidazoquinolines. Moreover, we observed that R848 induces Mal-dependent IFNß production via ERK1/2 activation as well as the transcription factor IRF7 activation. Although activation of TLR7 leads to NF-&#954;B-dependent expression of IRF7, this process is independent of Mal. We also demonstrate that secretion of IFNß regulated by TLR7 and Mal in macrophages and dendritic cells leads to the IP-10 chemokine expression. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that Mal is a critical regulator of the imidazoquinolinones-dependent IFNß production via ERK1/2/IRF7 signaling cascade which brings us closer to understanding the molecular mechanism's regulation of innate immune response.","Leszczynska, Ewa; Makuch, Edyta; Mitkiewicz, Malgorzata; Jasyk, Izabella; Narita, Miwako; Górska, Sabina; Lipinski, Tomasz; Siednienko, Jakub",Int. j. mol. sci.

However, information on early risk factors for the duration of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral positivity is not yet available. METHODS: In this prospective study, a cohort of 137 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled. Clinical information and laboratory data were retrieved from electronic medical records. Viral positivity duration was calculated by the interval from the day of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive results to the day SARS-CoV-2 testing showed negative results in these 137 patients with COVID-19. Early risk factors for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity were evaluated. RESULTS: The median SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity duration is 12 days (range, 4 to ~45) for this cohort. Cox regression results showed a significantly shorter viral positivity duration was related to younger age (hazard ratio [HR], .658; P = .017); disease not being severe (HR, .653; P = .076); higher lymphocyte (HR, 1.464; P = .033), eosinophil (HR, 1.514; P = .020), and CD8+â T-cell (HR, 1.745; P = .033) counts; and lower IL-6 (HR, .664; P = .036) and IL-10 (HR, .631; P = .021). Multivariate analysis with covariable-adjusted results showed that the CD8+â T-cell count (HR, 2.376; P= .114) was a predominant risk factor for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show early laboratory parameters such as CD8+â T-cell count to be risk factors for the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral positivity, which has significance in the control and prevention of the disease.","Lin, Aifen; He, Ze-Bao; Zhang, Sheng; Zhang, Jian-Gang; Zhang, Xia; Yan, Wei-Hua",Clin Infect Dis,,585

477993,Reflecting on the impact of COVID-19 on nurses,2020,"BACKGROUND: An ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading globally. Recently, several articles have mentioned that the early acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19 significantly differ from those of ARDS due to other causes. Actually, we newly observed that some mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients recovering from severe ARDS (more than 14 days after invasive ventilation) often experienced evidently gradual increases in CO2 retention and minute ventilation. However, the underlying mechanics remain unclear. CASE PRESENTATION: To explain these pathophysiological features and discuss the ventilatory strategy during the late phase of severe ARDS in COVID-19 patients, we first used a metabolic module on a General Electric R860 ventilator (Engstrom Carestation; GE Healthcare, USA) to monitor parameters related to gas metabolism, lung mechanics and physiological dead space in two COVID-19 patients. We found that remarkably decreased ventilatory efficiency (e.g., the ratio of dead space to tidal volume 70-80%, arterial to end-tidal CO2 difference 18-23 mmHg and ventilatory ratio 3-4) and hypermetabolism (oxygen consumption 300-400 ml/min, CO2 elimination 200-300 ml/min) may explain why these patients experienced more severe respiratory distress and CO2 retention in the late phase of ARDS caused by COVID-19. CONCLUSION: During the recovery period of ARDS among mechanically-ventilated COVID-19 patients, attention should be paid to the monitoring of physiological dead space and metabolism. Tidal volume (8-9 ml/kg) could be increased appropriately under the limited plateau pressure; however, barotrauma should still be kept in mind.","Xia, Jingen; Feng, Yingying; Li, Min; Yu, Xin; Zhang, Yi; Duan, Jun; Zhan, Qingyuan",BMC Infect Dis,,585
478892,Preventing a Rebound in Carbon Intensity Post-COVID-19 at the Global Level – Lessons Learned from the Change in Carbon Intensity before and after the 2008 Financial Crisis,2021,"BACKGROUND: We investigated the dynamic changes in lipid profiles and their correlations with disease severity and clinical outcome in patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 519 severe COVID-19 patients with confirmed outcomes (discharged or deceased), admitted to the West Court of Union Hospital in Wuhan, China, between 29 January and 8 April 2020. RESULTS: Altogether, 424 severe COVID-19 patients, including 34 non-survivors and 390 survivors, were included in the final analyses. During hospitalization, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) showed an increasing trend in survivors, but showed a downward trend in non-survivors. The serum concentrations of HDL-C and apoA-I were inversely correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP), length of hospital stay of survivors, and disease severity scores. For in-hospital deaths, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of the ratios of CRP/HDL-C and CRP/apoA-I at admission were 0.84 and 0.83, respectively. Moreover, patients with high ratios of CRP/HDL-C (ï¼77.39) or CRP/apoA-I (ï¼72.37) had higher mortality rates during hospitalization (log-rank p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that hypertension, lactate dehydrogenase, SOFA score, and High CRP/HDL-C ratio were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: During severe COVID-19, HDL-C and apoA-I concentrations are dramatically decreased in non-survivors. Moreover, High CRP/HDL-C ratio is significantly associated with an increase in mortality and a poor prognosis.","Li, Yi; Zhang, Yan; Lu, Rongli; Dai, Minhui; Shen, Minxue; Zhang, Jianchu; Cui, Yanhui; Liu, Ben; Lin, Fengyu; Chen, Lingli; Han, Duoduo; Fan, Yifei; Zeng, Yanjun; Li, Wen; Li, Sha; Chen, Xiang; Li, Haitao; Pan, Pinhua",Clin Chim Acta,,585

The Chinese government limited the migration of people almost from all walks of life. Medical workers have rushed into Hubei province to fight against the epidemic. Any activity that can increase infection is prohibited. The aim of this study was to confirm that timely lockdown, large-scale case-screening and other control measures proposed by the Chinese government were effective to contain the spread of the virus in the mainland of China. METHODS: Based on disease transmission-related parameters, this study was designed to predict the trend of COVID-19 epidemic in the mainland of China and provide theoretical basis for current prevention and control. An SEIQR epidemiological model incorporating asymptomatic transmission, short term immunity and imperfect isolation was constructed to evaluate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 inside and outside of Hubei province. With COVID-19 cases confirmed by the National Health Commission (NHC), the optimal parameters of the model were set by calculating the minimum Chi-square value. RESULTS: Before the migration to and from Wuhan was cut off, the basic reproduction number in China was 5.6015. From 23 January to 26 January 2020, the basic reproduction number in China was 6.6037. From 27 January to 11 February 2020, the basic reproduction number outside Hubei province dropped below 1, but that in Hubei province remained 3.7732. Because of stricter controlling measures, especially after the initiation of the large-scale case-screening, the epidemic rampancy in Hubei has also been contained. The average basic reproduction number in Hubei province was 3.4094 as of 25 February 2020. We estimated the cumulative number of confirmed cases nationwide was 82 186, and 69 230 in Hubei province on 9 April 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown of Hubei province significantly reduced the basic reproduction number. The large-scale case-screening also showed the effectiveness in the epidemic control. This study provided experiences that could be replicated in other countries suffering from the epidemic. Although the epidemic is subsiding in China, the controlling efforts should not be terminated before May.","Li, Yong; Wang, Lian-Wen; Peng, Zhi-Hang; Shen, Hong-Bing",Infect Dis Poverty,,585

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all the orthopedics surgical procedures performed at Guglielmo da Saliceto Hospital (Piacenza, Emilia Romagna, Northern Italy)between 1/1/20 and 30/06/20. 2019 semesters (1/01/20-30/6/20 and 1/07/20-31/12/20) have been used as control group to evaluate the activity trend of the first six months of 2020, compared to the two semesters of 2019. RESULTS: We noticed a significant increase of domestic and retirement houses accidents, a consistent increase in one-month mortality rate of 2020 first semester and a decrease of mean hospitalization time.About surgical procedures, we detect a drop in the total number: in the first semester of 2020 we performed 499 (-39.9%) surgeries less than the first semester of 2019 and 337 (-30.9%) then the second one. Traumatology recorded a decrease of 27.6% than the first semester of 2019 (-204 surgeries) and of 26.3% than the second one (-191 surgeries).Concerning orthopedic procedures, in comparison to the first semester of 2019 we registered a reduction of 57.6% (-295 surgeries) and of 40.2% to the second semester (-146 surgeries). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Covid-19 forced a reorganization of the Italian Health System that led to a clear reduction of surgical procedures performed in the orthopedic and traumatology department.The ""Phase 2"" can't be consider the last step of the emergency.We surely will have to get used to live with this enemy, at least until we will find an effective cure or a vaccine.","Maniscalco, Pietro; Quattrini, Fabrizio; Ciatti, Corrado; Gattoni, Serena; Puma Pagliarello, Calogero; Burgio, Valeria; Di Stefano, Giovanni; Cauteruccio, Michele; Giovanelli, Matteo; Magro, Alessandra; Capelli, Patrizio",Acta Biomed,,585

BACKGROUND: Health service research and the nursing management research debate have received little attention to date, despite their relevance in responding to the increased demand of care during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A critical analysis on experiences was performed while leading international-funded studies at different degrees of complexity and targets, involving nurse managers, nurses, care processes and health care services in the last year. RESULTS: Ongoing research projects have been profoundly affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in their aims, methods, management processes, feasibility and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak is an unprecedented stress test for the health care sector and for the nursing services. Its onset and persistence have rendered more easily to see what prevails in terms of effectiveness and what fails in our health care services. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nurse managers have lived and are still living through this crisis, given their omnipresence in the health care systems. Therefore, setting NMR priorities and working together to imagine and design the post-COVID-19 era is essential.","Palese, Alvisa; Papastavrou, Evridiki; Sermeus, Walter",J. nurs. manag,,585

The findings are based on ethnographic data collected from Makeni city and three rural communities in Bombali District, north Sierra Leone during the outbreak of COVID-19, between 23rd March and 6th May 2020. The findings show how state-led measures-indefinite district lockdown, three-day total lockdowns and mask wearing-were experienced and responded to in myriad ways, including adapting, not complying and resisting. The diverse ways members of society experience, react and shape the effects of internationally and nationally informed health policies during a global pandemic in Sierra Leone highlight the nuances of individual experience and agency in specific socio-political contexts.

Respondents were recontacted after four months. Information sources included mainstream media, state health departments, the CDC, the White House, and a well-known university. We also examined how demographics, political partisanship, and skepticism about COVID-19 were associated with the perceived trustworthiness of information sources and decreased trustworthiness over time. At baseline, the majority of respondants reported high trust in COVID-19 information from state health departments (75.6%), the CDC (80.9%), and a university (Johns Hopkins, 81.1%). Mainstream media was trusted by less than half the respondents (41.2%), and the White House was the least trusted source (30.9%). At the 4-month follow-up, a significant decrease in trustworthiness in all five sources of COVID-19 information was observed. The most pronounced reductions were from the CDC and the White House. In multivariate analyses, factors associated with rating the CDC, state health department, and a university as trustworthy sources of COVID-19 information were political party affiliation, level of education, and skepticism about COVID-19. The most consistent predictor of decreased trust was political party affiliation, with Democrats as compared to Republicans less likely to report decreased trust across all sources.","Latkin, Carl A; Dayton, Lauren; Strickland, Justin C; Colon, Brian; Rimal, Rajiv; Boodram, Basmattee",J Health Commun,,585

482142,The Benefit of Distraction: Denoising Remote Vitals Measurements using Inverse Attention,2020-10-14,"Information is key during a crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic as it greatly shapes people opinion, behaviour and even their psychological state. It has been acknowledged from the Secretary-General of the United Nations that the infodemic of misinformation is an important secondary crisis produced by the pandemic. Infodemics can amplify the real negative consequences of the pandemic in different dimensions: social, economic and even sanitary. For instance, infodemics can lead to hatred between population groups that fragment the society influencing its response or result in negative habits that help the pandemic propagate. On the contrary, reliable and trustful information along with messages of hope and solidarity can be used to control the pandemic, build safety nets and help promote resilience and antifragility. We propose a framework to characterize leaders in Twitter based on the analysis of the social graph derived from the activity in this social network. Centrality metrics are used to identify relevant nodes that are further characterized in terms of users parameters managed by Twitter. We then assess the resulting topology of clusters of leaders. Although this tool may be used for surveillance of individuals, we propose it as the basis for a constructive application to empower users with a positive influence in the collective behaviour of the network and the propagation of information.","Pastor-Escuredo, David; Tarazona, Carlota",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07266v1.pdf,585

482851,"Behavioral intention of receiving COVID-19 vaccination, social media exposures, and peer discussions in China",2021,"BACKGROUND: Numerous studies conducted in the United States found associations between prenatal exposure to particulate matter (PM) and adverse birth outcomes, and some studies identified vulnerable populations, including certain racial/ethnic groups and people with low-socioeconomic status. However, their findings are not always consistent. In this review, we compared the risk of adverse birth outcomes due to PM exposures among subpopulations and investigated whether any particular population is more vulnerable. METHODS: We selected U.S. studies examining associations between PM exposure during pregnancy and birth outcomes that included results for effect modification by race/ethnicity and/or maternal education. We summarized the findings for various sizes of PM and birth outcomes. Meta-analysis was conducted to quantify vulnerable race/ethnicity for the association between fine PM (PM2.5) and birthweight. RESULTS: In total, 19 studies were assessed, and PM-related risks of adverse birth outcomes, particularly those related to fetal growth, likely differ across subpopulations. A meta-analysis from five studies showed that a 10 µg/m3 increase of PM2.5 during the full-gestation reduced birthweight by 21.9 g (95% confidence interval 11.7, 32.0), 15.7 g (10.1, 21.4), 9.3 g (2.7, 15.8), and 5.8 g (- 9.0, 20.7) for Black, White, Hispanic, and Asian mothers, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our review indicated that Black mothers and mothers with low educational attainment are more vulnerable subpopulations. More investigation is needed for effect modification by other maternal factors, such as household income. Characterizing and quantifying vulnerable subpopulations are essential for addressing environmental justice since it can help regulatory agencies allocate resources and design policy interventions.","Thayamballi, Neil; Habiba, Sara; Laribi, Ouahiba; Ebisu, Keita",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,585

It is different from medical isolation, which is for people who have been infected with the disease. The word “quarantine” comes from quarantine, Italian language meaning “40 days”. This is because of the 40-day isolation of ships and people practiced as a measure of disease prevention related to the plague. This practice was named “Quaranta” in the Republic of Venice, whose economy is based on trade, by keeping the ships coming to the city in the sea for 40 days off the city, so that the capital Venice will not be infected with epidemics.People’s efforts to take precautions against a possible pandemic risk are a practice that has been going on for ages. Quarantine, which is among the measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, includes measures taken by avoiding contact with humans and animals in suspected cases exposed to infectious diseases for a period equal to the longest incubation period of the disease.

The woke era's partisan identity politics asymmetrically curtail acceptable expressions of religious authority on issues of race, religion, and politics. Hence, scholars spend their social capital as political actors in these ultracrepidarian environments to different ends. This multi-year study conducted across global sites analyzes scholars with dissimilar approaches to media and political engagement amidst an environment characterized by weaponized media, polarization, and shifting goal posts. Participant observation and textual analysis impart scenes of scholars with fraught associations to administrations, funding sources, and feuding authoritarian Arab regimes getting embroiled in geopolitical hostilities. With mainstream American Muslim narratives aligned with mainstream media's liberal filter bubbles, scholars impact consensus building with varying levels of success; those negotiating compromise within spheres of legitimate contestation and consensus ad interim maintain subsisting influence. However, those that do not are expurgated and thereby cede influence.","Latif, Jibril",Int J Polit Cult Soc,,585

At low temperatures, both lower density systems show stable gas-supercooled-liquid coexistence whereas the higher density system is homogeneous. We show that monomer density relaxation exhibits SE violation for all three densities, whereas molecular density relaxation shows a weak violation of the SE relation near $T_c$ in both lower density systems. This study identifies disparity in monomer mobility and observation of jumplike motion in the typical monomer trajectories resulting in the SE violations. In addition to the SE violation, a weak SED violation is observed in the gas-supercooled-liquid coexisting domains of the lower densities. Both lower density systems also show a decoupling of translational and rotational dynamics in this polymer system.","Singh, Jalim; Jose, Prasanth P",J. phys. condens. matter,,585

Despite the urgent need to find effective therapeutics, research on SARS-CoV-2 has been affected by a lack of suitable animal models. To facilitate the development of medical approaches and novel treatments, we compared the ACE2 receptor, and TMPRSS2 and Furin proteases usage of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein in human and in a panel of animal models, i.e. guinea pig, dog, cat, rat, rabbit, ferret, mouse, hamster and macaque. Here we showed that ACE2, but not TMPRSS2 or Furin, has a higher level of sequence variability in the Spike protein interaction surface, which greatly influences Spike protein binding mode. Using molecular docking simulations we compared the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins in complex with the ACE2 receptor and showed that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein is compatible to bind the human ACE2 with high specificity. In contrast, TMPRSS2 and Furin are sufficiently similar in the considered hosts not to drive susceptibility differences. Computational analysis of binding modes and protein contacts indicates that macaque, ferrets and hamster are the most suitable models for the study of inhibitory antibodies and small molecules targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein interaction with ACE2. Since TMPRSS2 and Furin are similar across species, our data also suggest that transgenic animal models expressing human ACE2, such as the hACE2 transgenic mouse, are also likely to be useful models for studies investigating viral entry.","Brooke, Greg N; Prischi, Filippo",Sci Rep,,585

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have led to a significant change in the pattern and the number of medical visits. We assessed changing patterns of medical visits and no-show, and identified factors associated with no-show in patients with RA during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: RA patients treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs at least 6 months who had been in remission or those with mild disease activity were observed for 6 months from February to July 2020. No-show was defined as a missed appointment that was not previously cancelled by the patient and several variables that might affect no-show were examined. RESULTS: A total of 376 patients and 1,189 appointments were evaluated. Among 376 patients, 164 patients (43.6%) missed appointment more than one time and no-show rate was 17.2% during COVID-19 pandemic. During the observation, face-to-face visits gradually increased and no-show gradually decreased.

While attenuated mortality was observed with aggressive glucose control, it was unclear whether therapeutic regimens including insulin treatment were beneficial for patients with COVID-19 and T2D. This retrospective study investigated 689 patients with COVID-19 and T2D from a cohort of 3,305 cases from Wuhan, China. Unexpectedly, we found that insulin treatment for patients with COVID-19 and T2D was associated with a significant increase in mortality (27.2% versus 3.5%; adjusted HR, 5.38 [2.75-10.54]). Further analysis showed that insulin treatment was associated with enhanced systemic inflammation and aggravated injuries of vital organs. Therefore, insulin treatment for patients with COVID-19 and T2D should be used with caution.","Yu, Bo; Li, Chenze; Sun, Yang; Wang, Dao Wen",Cell metab,,585

In December 2019, the world awoke to a new zoonotic strain of CoV that was named SARS-CoV-2 (standing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), which has been classified as a high-consequence infectious disease. In addition, serious complications related to COVID-19 have been reported in some patients. These include acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, septic shock and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

While the common cold symptoms are observed in mild cases, COVID-19 is accompanied by multiorgan failure in severe patients. The involvement of different organs in severe patients results in lengthening the hospitalization duration and increasing the mortality rate. In this review, we aimed to investigate the involvement of different organs in COVID-19 patients, particularly in severe cases. Also, we tried to define the potential underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV2 induced multiorgan failure. The multi-organ dysfunction is characterized by acute lung failure, acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, cardiovascular disease, and as well as a wide spectrum of hematological abnormalities and neurological disorders. The most important mechanisms are related to the direct and indirect pathogenic features of SARS-CoV2. Although the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a receptor of SARS-CoV2 in the lung, heart, kidney, testis, liver, lymphocytes, and nervous system was confirmed, there are controversial findings to about the observation of SARS-CoV2 RNA in these organs. Moreover, the organ failure may be induced by the cytokine storm, a result of increased levels of inflammatory mediators, endothelial dysfunction, coagulation abnormalities, and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the organs. Therefore, further investigations are needed to detect the exact mechanisms of pathogenesis. Since the involvement of several organs in COVID-19 patients is important for clinicians, increasing their knowledge may help to improve the outcomes and decrease the rate of mortality and morbidity.","Mokhtari, Tahmineh; Hassani, Fatemeh; Ghaffari, Neda; Ebrahimi, Babak; Yarahmadi, Atousa; Hassanzadeh, Ghomareza",J Mol Histol,,585

Niger, a landlocked country, is tasked with controlling the pandemic. However, of the big challenges the country faced is the fragility of healthcare system which posed limitations to the fight against the virus. The virus overwhelmed the fragile healthcare system which led to inaccessibility of quality healthcare to the citizens coupled with issues of flooding and economic recession that happened during the pandemic. The healthcare sectored has further been crippled by exposure and infection of the already insufficient healthcare workers. In addition to this, there was the burden of NTDs and other communicable and non-communicable diseases that subverted the country in the depths of difficulties. As per the predictions of World Bank, the poverty curve is likely to escalate due to the outrageous impacts of COVID-19. Adding on to this, the occurrence of natural disasters such as flooding has further stretched the country. It's no coincidence that the country would confront plethora of challenges amidst the second wave. Therefore, timely decision and necessary interventions are needed to strengthen the country's fight against the pandemic. However, this is only feasible when Nigerien government, international allies and other wealthy nations work closely to ensure that the challenges faced by the healthcare system are tackled.","Emmanuella, Nzeribe; Michael, Udofa Edidiong; Musa, Shuaibu Saidu; Marc, Mirindi Batumike; David, Success; Edet, Bassey Esther; Essar, Mohammad Yasir; Adebisi, Yusuff Adebayo; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,,585
487016,Risk factors and outcomes for acute-on-chronic liver failure in COVID-19: a large multi-center observational cohort study,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 remains a significant burden on human health. Several lines of evidence suggest that surveillance of sewage and waste can provide an early warning sign for COVID-19 recurrence in a community. In support, SARS-CoV-2 traces were found in sewage in several countries. With this in mind, it is notable that pests, such as cockroaches, are exposed to pathogenic microbes routinely, yet thrive in polluted environments. Such species have likely developed mechanisms to protect themselves against pathogens. In support, recent studies showed that cockroaches possess potent antibacterial molecules to shield themselves from pathogenic bacteria. Among hundreds of molecules, some contained thiazine groups, imidazoles, chromene derivatives, isoquinoline group, sulfonamides, pyrrole-containing analogs, flavanones, and furanones. Here, we propose that cockroaches are a potential source of antiviral molecules to thwart infections. Because this is an unexploited resource for potential antivirals, we believe that cockroaches offer a unique source for novel bioactive molecule(s) to counter COVID-19 with huge clinical impact worldwide.","Siddiqui, Ruqaiyyah; Khan, Naveed Ahmed",ACS Chem Neurosci,,585

METHODS: This was a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients who underwent an HbA1c test. Their demographic data, medical history, signs and symptoms of COVID-19, laboratory test results, and final outcomes of COVID-19 treatment were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients were included and divided into three groups based on their blood glucose status. There were significant differences in SaO2, serum ferritin level, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen (Fbg) level, and IL6 level among the three groups. A pairwise comparison of the groups showed that groups B and C were significantly different from group A in terms of CRP, ESR, and Fbg, IL6, and serum ferritin levels (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that there was a linear negative correlation between SaO2 and HbA1c (r = -0.22, P = 0.01), while there was a linear positive correlation between serum ferritin, CRP, Fbg, and ESR levels and HbA1c (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: High HbA1c level is associated with inflammation, hypercoagulability, and low SaO2 in COVID-19 patients, and the mortality rate (27.7%) is higher in patients with diabetes. Determining HbA1c level after hospital admission is thus helpful assessing inflammation, hypercoagulability, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Zhenzhou; Du, Zhe; Zhu, Fengxue",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,585
487294,Culture in the context of COVID-19: Impact assessment and support measures,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) environmental contamination occurs through droplets and biological fluids released in the surroundings from patients or asymptomatic carriers. Surfaces and objects contaminated by saliva or nose secretions represent a risk for indirect transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We assayed surfaces from hospital and living spaces to identify the presence of viral RNA and the spread of fomites in the environment. Anthropic contamination by droplets and biological fluids was monitored by detecting the microbiota signature using multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) on selected species and massive sequencing on 16S amplicons. A total of 92 samples (flocked swabs) were collected from critical areas during the pandemic, including indoor (three hospitals and three public buildings) and outdoor surfaces exposed to anthropic contamination (handles and handrails, playgrounds). Traces of biological fluids were frequently detected in spaces open to the public and on objects that are touched with the hands (>80%). However, viral RNA was not detected in hospital wards or other indoor and outdoor surfaces either in the air system of a COVID hospital but only in the surroundings of an infected patient, in consistent association with droplet traces and fomites. Handled objects accumulated the highest level of multiple contaminations by saliva, nose secretions, and fecal traces, further supporting the priority role of handwashing in prevention. In conclusion, anthropic contamination by droplets and biological fluids is widespread in spaces open to the public and can be traced by qPCR. Monitoring fomites can support evaluation of indirect transmission risks for coronavirus or other flu-like viruses in the environment.IMPORTANCE Several studies have evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. Saliva and nasopharyngeal droplets can land on objects and surfaces, creating fomites. A suitable indicator would allow the detection of droplets or biofluids carrying the virus. Therefore, we searched for viral RNA and droplets and fomites on at risk surfaces. We monitored by qPCR or next generation sequencing (NGS) droplets through their microbiota. Although the study was performed during the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 was not significantly found on surfaces, with the only exception of environmental areas near infectious patients. Conversely, anthropic contamination was frequent, suggesting a role for biofluids as putative markers of indirect transmission and risk assessment. Moreover, all SARS-CoV-2-contaminated surfaces showed droplets' microbiota. Fomite monitoring by qPCR may have an impact on public health strategies, supporting prevention of indirect transmission similarly to what is done for other communicable diseases (e.g., influenza and influenza-like infections).","Piana, Andrea; Colucci, Maria Eugenia; Valeriani, Federica; Marcolongo, Adriano; Sotgiu, Giovanni; Pasquarella, Cesira; Margarucci, Lory Marika; Petrucca, Andrea; Gianfranceschi, Gianluca; Babudieri, Sergio; Vitali, Pietro; D039,; Ermo, Giuseppe; Bizzarro, Assunta; De Maio, Flavio; Vitali, Matteo; Azara, Antonio; Romano, Ferdinando; Simmaco, Maurizio; Romano Spica, Vincenzo",MSphere,,585

METHOD: We deployed a survey of approximately 2,000 American adults to measure support for nine COVID-19 surveillance measures. We assessed attitudes toward contact tracing apps by manipulating six different attributes of a hypothetical app through a conjoint analysis experiment. RESULTS: A smaller percentage of respondents support the government encouraging everyone to download and use contact tracing apps (42%) compared with other surveillance measures such as enforcing temperature checks (62%), expanding traditional contact tracing (57%), carrying out centralized quarantine (49%), deploying electronic device monitoring (44%), or implementing immunity passes (44%). Despite partisan differences on a range of surveillance measures, support for the government encouraging digital contact tracing is indistinguishable between Democrats (47%) and Republicans (46%), although more Republicans oppose the policy (39%) compared to Democrats (27%). Of the app features we tested in our conjoint analysis experiment, only one had statistically significant effects on the self-reported likelihood of downloading the app: decentralized data architecture increased the likelihood by 5.4 percentage points. CONCLUSION: Support for public health surveillance policies to curb the spread of COVID-19 is relatively low in the U.S. Contact tracing apps that use decentralized data storage, compared with those that use centralized data storage, are more accepted by the public. While respondents' support for expanding traditional contact tracing is greater than their support for the government encouraging the public to download and use contact tracing apps, there are smaller partisan differences in support for the latter policy.","Zhang, Baobao; Kreps, Sarah; McMurry, Nina; McCain, R Miles",PLoS One,,585

METHODS: Five frontline echocardiographers performed and interpreted B-TTE for 30 patients with COVID-19 in the isolation wards, and the on-site B-TTE reports (OSR) were generated. Then remote consultation over the 30 B-TTE studies was conducted by two experienced echocardiographic consultants while blinded to the OSR, and the corresponding remote consultation reports (RCR) were generated. Subsequently, the five frontline echocardiographers were convened together to discuss the difference between the OSR and RCR, and to confirm the correct interpretation and the misdiagnosis using a ""majority-vote"" consensus as the diagnostic ""gold standard"". Afterwards the reasons for the misdiagnosis were given by the frontline echocardiographers themselves. The inter-rater agreement between the OSR and the ""gold standard"" was assessed using Kappa coefficient and percent agreement. RESULTS: Complete correctness of the 30 copies of the RCR were determined by the 5 frontline echocardiographers. The reliability of the OSR in the findings of cardiac chamber dilation, left ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary hypertension were weak (Kappa <0.6). The reliability of the OSR in the recognition of major cardiac abnormalities was very weak (Kappa =0.304, percent agreement =63.3%). Misdiagnosis of major abnormalities was found in 11 copies of OSR (11/30, 36.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The protocol of RC-B-TTE has shown noticeable superiority in ameliorating diagnostic accuracy of echocardiography, which should be generalized to clinical practice during the COVID-19 or similar pandemic.","Lu, Jing; Lin, Jun; Yin, Lixue; Shi, Rui; Li, Huanxing; Ge, Yang; Luo, Jing",Echocardiography,,585

RECENT FINDINGS: Critical illness demands objective, targeted nutritional therapy to prevent adverse effects of underfeeding/over feeding. Thus, all recent societal guidelines recommend indirect calorimetry use to determine energy needs. Very recently, indirect calorimetry technology has finally evolved to allow for accurate, simple, and routine utilization in a wider range of ICU patients. Recent data continues to confirm poor correlation between measured and equation-predicted energy expenditure emphasizing need for indirect calorimetry to be standard of care. This may be particularly true in COVID-19, where significant progressive hypermetabolism and variability in energy expenditure has been shown. Metabolic physiology can change frequently during ICU stay in response to changes in clinical condition or care. Thus, repeated longitudinal indirect calorimetry measures are needed throughout ICU stay to optimize care, with initial data showing improved clinical outcomes when indirect calorimetry targets are utilized. SUMMARY: Personalized ICU care demands objective data to guide therapy. This includes use of indirect calorimetry to determine energy expenditure and guide ICU nutrition therapy. Long-awaited new innovations in indirect calorimetry technology should finally lead to indirect calorimetry to becoming a fundamental component of modern ICU standard of care and clinical research moving forward.","De Waele, Elisabeth; Jonckheer, Joop; Wischmeyer, Paul E",Curr Opin Crit Care,,585

In addition, we assessed the kinetics of antibody appearance using these assays in 22 patients after they were tested positive by RT-PCR. We observed great heterogeneity in antibody detection post-symptom onset. The median antibody detection time was between 8 and 10 days according to the manufacturers. All the tests showed a sensitivity of 60 to 80% on day 10 and 100% on day 15. In addition, a single cross-reaction was observed with other human coronavirus infections.

We study the COMP and NCOMP decoding algorithms for non-adaptive pooling strategies based on maximally disjunct pooling matrices with constant row and column sums in the linear prevalence regime and in the presence of noisy measurements motivated by PCR tests. We calculate sensitivity, specificity, the probabilities of Type I and II errors, and the expected number of items with a positive result as well as the expected number of false positives and false negatives. We further provide estimates on the variance of the number of positive and false positive results. We conduct a thorough discussion of the calculations and bounds derived.

COVID-19 mitigation strategies have unintended consequences on managing chronic conditions such as hypertension, a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and health disparities in the United States. During the first wave of the pandemic in the United States, the combination of observed racial/ethnic inequities in COVID-19 deaths and social unrest reinvigorated a national conversation about systemic racism in health care and society. The 4th Annual University of Utah Translational Hypertension Symposium gathered frontline clinicians, researchers, and leaders from diverse backgrounds to discuss the intersection of these 2 critical social and public health phenomena and to highlight preexisting disparities in hypertension treatment and control exacerbated by COVID-19. The discussion underscored environmental and socioeconomic factors that are deeply embedded in US health care and research that impact inequities in hypertension. Structural racism plays a central role at both the health system and individual levels. At the same time, virtual healthcare platforms are being accelerated into widespread use by COVID-19, which may widen the divide in healthcare access across levels of wealth, geography, and education. Blood pressure control rates are declining, especially among communities of color and those without health insurance or access to health care.

However, there is a lack of data on the full clinical course of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Europe, especially in the population that developed acute respiratory failure (ARF). OBJECTIVES: To identify risk factors associated with developing ARF during SARS-CoV-2 infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was an observational study of 60 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data were collected from March 26, 2020 to May 26, 2020 in a tertiary academic hospital in Poland. All patients reached final outcome (discharge from the hospital or death). We divided patients into 2 groups based on whether they developed ARF, compared their clinical data, and performed multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (36%) from the observed cohort developed ARF. Logistic regression identified that a high sequential organ failure assessment score at admission (odds ratio (OR) = 6.97 (1.57-30.90, p = 0.011)), and a long time from admission until pneumonia (OR = 1.41 (1.06-1.87, p = 0.016)), correlated with ARF development. D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) differed both statistically and clinically between ARF and non-ARF groups. The mortality rate in the observed cohort of patients was 13.3%, and it was 32% in the group that developed ARF. CONCLUSIONS: Routine vigilant examination of the above markers may identify patients at the highest risk of ARF early on during COVID-19 infection.","Piwowarczyk, Pawel; Szczukocka, Marta; Kutnik, Pawel; Borys, Michal; Miklaszewska, Anna; Kiciak, Slawomir; Czuczwar, Miroslaw",Adv. clin. exp. med,,585

Using district level data from India, we examine the effects of caste and religious fragmentation along with economic inequality on the growth rate of reported cases. The findings indicate positive effects of caste homogeneity while observing limited impact of economic inequality and religious homogeneity. However, the gains from higher caste homogeneity are seen to erode with the unlocking procedure after the nationwide lockdown. We find that community cohesion through caste effect is relatively dominant in rural areas even when mobility restrictions are withdrawn. Our findings indicate planners should prioritize public health interventions in caste-wise heterogeneous areas to compensate for the absence of community cohesion. The importance of our study lies in empirically validating the causal pathway between homogeneity and infection and providing a basis for zoning infection prone areas.","Rathore, Udayan; Das, Upasak; Sarkhel, Prasenjit",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05839v1.pdf,585
490993,Covid-19 and Islamic Education in School: Searching for Alternative Learning Media,2021,"By late April 2020, public discourse in the U.S. had shifted toward the idea of using more targeted case-based mitigation tactics (e.g., contact tracing) to combat COVID-19 transmission while allowing for the safe ""re-opening"" of society, in an effort to reduce the social, economic, and political ramifications associated with stricter approaches. Expanded tracing-testing efforts were touted as a key solution that would allow for a precision approach, thus preventing economies from having to shut down again. However, it is now clear that many regions of the U.S. were unable to mount robust enough testing-tracing programs to prevent major resurgences of disease. This viewpoint offers a discussion of why testing-tracing efforts failed to sufficiently mitigate COVID-19 across much of the nation, with the hope that such deliberation will help the U.S. public health community better plan for the future.","Clark, Eva; Chiao, Elizabeth Y; Amirian, E Susan",Clin Infect Dis,,585

This retrospective cohort study included COVID-19 patients with oxygen saturation (SatO2 ) in room air <92% admitted between March 3 and April 30, 2020. Following the interim protocol, patients could receive dexamethasone or methylprednisolone, and were classified according to oxygen requirements. The primary endpoint was admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or mortality. Kaplan-Meier and Cox hazards analyses were used. Of the 115 patients included, 38 received corticosteroids. Among requiring high-flow, noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2 ) > 0.40, the hazard ratio (HR) for death or ICU admission, between the corticosteroids and non-corticosteroids group, was 0.07 (95% CI 0.01-0.4), p = .002, and for patients requiring low-flow oxygen, the HR was 0.70 (95% CI 0.13-3.8), p = .68. Significant differences were also observed when all patients were analyzed together. A significant reduction in mortality and ICU admission frequency was observed among patients requiring high-flow oxygen or NIV, but not among those requiring low-flow oxygen.

This study aims to investigate the clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with viral shedding in children with mild COVID-19. METHODS: The clinical and laboratory information of 110 children with COVID-19 at Wuhan Children's Hospital, Wuhan, China, from January 30 to March 10, 2020, were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The median age was 6 years old. The median period of viral shedding of COVID-19 was 15 days (interquartile range [IQR], 11-20 days) as measured from illness onset to discharge. This period was shorter in asymptomatic patients (26.4%) compared with symptomatic patients (73.6%) (11 days vs. 17 days). Multivariable regression analysis showed increased odds of symptomatic infection was associated with age <6 years (odds ratio [OR] 8.94, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.55-31.35; P = 0.001), hypersensitive C-reactive protein >3.0 mg/L (OR 4.89; 95% CI: 1.10-21.75; P = 0.037) and presenting pneumonia in chest radiologic findings (OR 8.45; 95% CI: 2.69-26.61; P < 0.001).

Objective: To assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among health care workers treating patients exposed to COVID-19 in China. Design, Settings, and Participants: This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 1257 health care workers in 34 hospitals from January 29, 2020, to February 3, 2020, in China. Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. Main Outcomes and Measures: The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. Results: A total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%. A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women. Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; P = .007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; P < .001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale-Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; P < .001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; P = .008). Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = .01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; P < .001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; P < .001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; P < .001).

The study involved both medical staff and patients.Data analysis A retrospective analysis of an eight-week period (February-April 2020) collated 1,471 patient records and examined diagnoses, procedures performed and COVID-19 status of patients and staff. Any attempts made to access routine dental care before presentation in secondary care were recorded.Results In the study period, one member of staff was confirmed as COVID-19-positive. Sixty-three patients had formal COVID-19 tests; all were negative. Forty-three patients were admitted for drainage of odontogenic fascial space infections; 53% reported delayed or failed attempts to access dental care before their infection. Additionally, the authors describe a screening process, personal protective equipment (PPE) allocation and staff/patient testing protocols employed in their surgical unit throughout this period.Conclusions The authors suggest a series of triage and screening measures to limit the risk of unknowingly exposing clinical staff to the COVID-19 virus and offer advice on safely delaying non-emergency treatment where necessary. Recommendations for use of PPE for aerosol and non-aerosol generating procedures are made, but it is important to recognise that the efficacy of these measures cannot be determined by the methodology employed. This paper demonstrates an early example of complications developing from absent or delayed routine dental services resulting from lockdowns. This 'excess morbidity' is likely to have an impact on healthcare services as the pandemic recovery unfolds and services begin to return to normal.","Jones, Adam; Wilson, Gavin",Evid Based Dent,,585

The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) gene complex plays a critical role in host immunity. Here we analyse data from eight patient samples from the initial COVID-19 outbreak, and report on their HLA profiles. Our analysis paradigm may help provide future insights on disease susceptibility. RESULTS: We predicted HLA class I and II alleles from the transcriptome sequencing data prepared from the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples of five patients and from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of three patients at the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. We observe certain HLA allele overlap between the patients of those small cohorts, including the HLA-I A*24:02 allele predicted in four out of the five patients of the first cohort and HLA-II haplotype DPA1*02:02-DPB1*05:01 predicted in seven out of the eight patient samples analysed. Our analysis demonstrates the technical feasibility of HLA typing from BAL and PMBC metatranscriptomic samples. We stress that these are small cohorts, and although informative with respect to uncovering possible host defence genes shared between patients, additional work on larger cohorts is warranted to yield new and actionable knowledge on host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.

Gone were Monday through Friday routines of school day, extracurricular activities, and evening homework; schools scrambled to launch alternative delivery systems, expecting parents to step in and spend significant amounts of time helping children continue to learn. This study examines the sudden shift to distance learning using data from U.S. Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey. Conducted weekly from April through July 2020, the survey tracked COVID-related shocks to employment, health, food and housing security, and education in the U.S. population. We use Pulse data on 200,000 households with K-12 children to examine how school systems shifted, how parents stepped up and spent time helping children learn, how parental time inputs varied with parent education, and how education changes intersected with other pandemic shocks, including job loss and food insecurity. We find that parents and children spent significantly more time in learning activities when their schools provided diversified educational inputs, especially live contact time with teachers; live contact hours also facilitated children learning on their own. Given the type of alternative schooling, less educated parents spent no less time helping children than better educated parents, although they faced significantly more problems with computer and internet access. Thus, parents generally tried to help children continue learning in the pandemic, albeit with potentially wide variation in the resources they could supply to mitigate the drop in learning.","Bansak, Cynthia; Starr, Martha",Rev Econ Househ,,585

Indole is widely used as a medical material owing to its astounding biological activities. Indole and its derivatives belong to a significant category of heterocyclic compounds that have been used as a crucial component for several syntheses of medicine. A straightforward one-pot three-component synthesis of indole, coupled with Mannich base derivatives 1a-1j, was synthesized without a catalyst. The products were confirmed by IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, mass spectra, and elemental analysis. The indole derivatives were tested for cytotoxic activity, using three cancer cell lines and normal cell lines of Human embryonic kidney cell (HEK293), liver cell (LO2), and lung cell (MRC5) by MTT assay using doxorubicin as the standard drug. The result of cytotoxicity indole compound 1c (HepG2, LC50-0.9 mum, MCF-7, LC50-0.55 mum, HeLa, LC50-0.50 mum) was found to have high activity compared with other compounds used for the same purpose.

This study focused on investigating the early impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. construction industry since the declaration of the national emergency on 13 March 2020. The study objectives were achieved through 34 telephone interviews with project managers, engineers, designers, and superintendents that represented different states and distinct industry sectors in the United States (U.S.). The interviewees offered information on their experience with the pandemic, including the general and adverse effects experienced, new opportunities created, and risk management efforts being undertaken. The reported adverse effects included significant delays on projects, inability to secure materials on time, reduction in productivity rates, material price escalations, and others. The new opportunities that were created included projects involving the fast-track construction of medical facilities, construction of residential buildings, transportation-related work, and opportunities to recruit skilled workers. The risk management measures that were widely adopted included measures to enhance safety and reduce other project risks. The safety measures adopted included requiring employees to wear cloth face masks, adoption of social distancing protocols, staggering of construction operations, offering COVID-19-related training, administering temperature checks prior to entry into the workplace, and others. Measures to manage other project risks included the formation of a task force team to review the evolving pandemic and offer recommendations, advocating that construction businesses be deemed essential to combat delays and taking advantage of government relief programs. The study findings will be useful to industry stakeholders interested in understanding the early impacts of the pandemic on the construction industry. Industry stakeholders may also build upon the reported findings and establish best practices for continued safe and productive operations.","Alsharef, Abdullah; Banerjee, Siddharth; Uddin, S M Jamil; Albert, Alex; Jaselskis, Edward",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,585

Endomyocardial biopsies were the most common procedure (n = 27; 52%). Interventional and diagnostic procedures represented 27% (n = 14) and 21% (n = 11) of cases, respectively. Two emergent procedures (3.8%) were performed on patients with positive COVID-19 testing. Most cases were performed on patients with negative COVID-19 testing (n = 33; 94%). CONCLUSIONS: Adjusting to the COVID-19 pandemic in a high-volume pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratory can be safely and effectively managed by prioritizing emergent and urgent cases and modifying workflow operations. The experience of this center may assist other pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratories in adapting to similar practice changes as the pandemic continues to evolve.","Oshiro, Kristin T; Turner, Mariel E; Torres, Alejandro J; Crystal, Matthew A; Vincent, Julie A; Barry, Oliver M",J Invasive Cardiol,,585

496485,Massive use of disinfectants against COVID-19 poses potential risks to urban wildlife,2020,"PURPOSE: The worldwide outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has posed challenges for nurses. The aim of this study was to examine the managerial and clinical challenges of nurse managers in mental health centers during the current COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: A mixed-methods study based on an analysis of data obtained in focus groups with 25 nurse managers from two mental health centers in Israel. METHODS: The quantitative phase was conducted prior to the group sessions using a structured self-administered questionnaire that examined the nurse managers' (a) background data, (b) communication with the staff nurses, (c) perceptions of nurses' functioning, (d) perceptions of their own functioning, and (e) management as impacted by the pandemic. The qualitative phase included three sessions of focus groups in which the nurse managers discussed both their challenging and positive issues during the pandemic. FINDINGS: The most important challenges were related to the need to protect patients from infection and communicating with families and primary caregivers. Work policies and procedures were less well adapted to pandemic conditions; nevertheless, nurse managers felt a sense of purpose, duty, and pride in their work. Three themes emerged: (a) ""management complexity"" included the change from a familiar routine to a new reality, working in capsules, protecting against infection, functional confusion, and insights into future epidemics; (b) ""challenging communication"" included communication with patients through glass walls and communication with staff through screens and (c) ""bright spots"" referred to staff cohesion and the provision of respectful care. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health nurse managers have experienced during the pandemic a change in their roles from being less managerial to focusing more on clinical work. Communication between nurse managers and staff nurses and between mental health patients and staff were the main challenges. Nurse managers favorably noted the uniformity and humanity of the staff, sense of cohesion, and shared responsibility. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the first wave of the pandemic, there was confusion as to the functional role of ward nurse managers, as the focus of their activities became more clinical and less managerial. During and after the pandemic, preventive interventions should be carried out in order to assist patients, staff nurses, and nurse managers in mental health centers.","Kagan, Ilya; Shor, Razya; Ben Aharon, Iris; Yerushalmi, Sarit; Kigli-Shemesh, Ronit; Gelman, Sophi; Itzhaki, Michal",J. nurs. scholarsh,,585

496703,COVID-19 and Motivated Reasoning: The Influence of Knowledge on COVID-Related Policy and Health Behavior,2021,"Supplying SARS-COVID-19 vaccines in quantities to meet global demand has a bottleneck in manufacturing capacity. Assessment of existing mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) vaccine processing shows the need for digital twins enabled by process analytical technology approaches to improve process transfers for manufacturing capacity multiplication, reduction of out-of-specification batch failures, qualified personnel training for faster validation and efficient operation, optimal utilization of scarce buffers and chemicals, and faster product release. A digital twin of the total pDNA (plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid) to mRNA process is proposed. In addition, a first feasibility of multisensory process analytical technology (PAT) is shown. Process performance characteristics are derived as results and evaluated regarding manufacturing technology bottlenecks. Potential improvements could be pointed out such as dilution reduction in lysis, and potential reduction of necessary chromatography steps. 1 g pDNA may lead to about 30 g mRNA. This shifts the bottleneck towards the mRNA processing step, which points out co-transcriptional capping as a preferred option to reduce the number of purification steps. Purity demands are fulfilled by a combination of mixed-mode and reversed-phase chromatography as established unit operations on a higher industrial readiness level than e.g., precipitation and ethanol-chloroform extraction. As a final step, lyophilization was chosen for stability, storage and transportation logistics. Alternative process units like UF/DF (ultra-/diafiltration) integration would allow the adjustment of final concentration and buffer composition before lipid-nano particle (LNP) formulation. The complete digital twin is proposed for further validation in manufacturing scale and utilization in process optimization and manufacturing operations. The first PAT results should be followed by detailed investigation of different batches and processing steps in order to implement this strategy for process control and reliable, efficient operation.","Schmidt, Axel Helgers Heribert Vetter Florian Lukas Juckers Alex Strube Jochen",Processes,,585
496730,The potential public health and economic value of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine in the United States: Use of cost-effectiveness modeling to inform vaccination prioritization,2021,"Importance: Understanding youth well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic can help appropriately allocate resources and inform policies to support youth. Objective: To examine caregiver-reported changes in the psychological well-being of their children 3 to 4 months after the start of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, and to examine the association of caregiver-reported COVID-19 exposure and family stressors with caregiver perceptions of child psychological well-being. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study used an anonymous survey distributed via email from June 24 to July 15, 2020, to 350â¯000 families of students attending public schools in Chicago, Illinois. The a priori hypotheses were that caregivers would report worsening in child psychological well-being during the closure period compared with preclosure and that exposure to COVID-19-related stressors would be associated with a higher probability of worsening child psychological well-being. Data were analyzed from September 10, 2020, to March 15, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes were 7 mental health concerns and 5 positive adjustment characteristics reported by caregivers using a retrospective pre-post design. COVID-19 exposure and family stressors were also reported by caregivers. Results: Among 350â¯000 families invited to participate, 32â¯217 caregivers (10â¯827 [39.3%] White, 8320 [30.2%] Latinx, 6168 [22.4%] Black; 2223 [8.1%] with multiple or other races/ethnicities) completed the survey on behalf of 49â¯397 children in prekindergarten through 12th grade. Child-specific outcomes were reported for 40â¯723 to 40â¯852 children depending on the specific question. The frequency of caregiver endorsement of youth mental health concerns ranged from 0.1 percentage point (suicidal ideation or self-harm, reported by 191 caregivers [0.5%] preclosure vs 246 caregivers [0.6%] during closure; P < .001) to 28.3 percentage points (loneliness, reported by 1452 caregivers [3.6%] preclosure vs 13â¯019 caregivers [31.9%] during closure; P < .001) higher after the end of in-person instruction compared with preclosure. Frequency of caregiver endorsement of youth positive adjustment characteristics ranged from -13.4 percentage points (plans for the future, reported by 18â¯114 caregivers [44.3%] preclosure vs 12â¯601 caregivers [30.9%] during closure; P < .001) to -30.9 percentage points (positive peer relationships, reported by 24â¯666 caregivers [60.4%] preclosure vs 19â¯130 caregivers [46.8%] during closure; P < .001) lower after the end of in-person instruction. Significant differences in COVID-19 exposure were observed across racial/ethnic (F3,27â¯534 = 614.8; P < .001) and household income strata (F5,27â¯506 = 842.0; P < .001). After accounting for covariates, all mental health concerns increased in probability (eg, angry: odds ratio, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.48-1.62]; P < .001) and all the positive adjustment characteristics decreased in probability (eg, hopeful or positive: odds ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.84-0.92]; P < .001) as COVID-19 exposure and family stressors increased. Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study of caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 and resulting exposure to stress were associated with worse youth psychological well-being, demonstrating the need for a comprehensive public health approach that prioritizes children's well-being and draws broad public attention to the mental health needs of youth.","Raviv, Tali; Warren, Christopher M; Washburn, Jason J; Kanaley, Madeleine K; Eihentale, Liga; Goldenthal, Hayley Jane; Russo, Jaclyn; Martin, Caroline P; Lombard, Lisa S; Tully, Jamie; Fox, Kenneth; Gupta, Ruchi",JAMA Netw Open,,585

497105,The impact of Covid-19 on Turkey’s non-recoverable economic sectors compensating with falling crude oil prices: A computable general equilibrium analysis,2020,"Arachnids are the second most successful terrestrial animal group after insects [1] and were one of the first arthropod clades to successfully invade land [2]. Fossil evidence for this transition is limited, with the majority of arachnid clades first appearing in the terrestrial fossil record. Furthermore, molecular clock dating has suggested a Cambrian-Ordovician terrestrialization event for arachnids [3], some 60 Ma before their first fossils in the Silurian, although these estimates assume that arachnids evolved from a fully aquatic ancestor. Eurypterids, the sister clade to terrestrial arachnids [4-6], are known to have undergone major macroecological shifts in transitioning from marine to freshwater environments during the Devonian [7, 8]. Discoveries of apparently subaerial eurypterid trackways [9, 10] have led to the suggestion that eurypterids were even able to venture on land and possibly breathe air [11]. However, modern horseshoe crabs undertake amphibious excursions onto land to reproduce [12], rendering trace fossil evidence alone inconclusive. Here, we present details of the respiratory organs of Adelophthalmus pyrrhae sp. nov. from the Carboniferous of Montagne Noire, France [13], revealed through micro computed tomography (µ-CT) imaging. Pillar-like trabeculae on the dorsal surface of each gill lamella indicate eurypterids were capable of subaerial breathing, suggesting that book gills are the direct precursors to book lungs while vascular ancillary respiratory structures known as Kiemenplatten represent novel air-breathing structures. The discovery of air-breathing structures in eurypterids indicates that characters permitting terrestrialization accrued in the arachnid stem lineage and suggests the Cambrian-Ordovician ancestor of arachnids would also have been semi-terrestrial.","Lamsdell, James C; McCoy, Victoria E; Perron-Feller, Opal A; Hopkins, Melanie J",Curr. biol,,585

In this paper, we establish a novel fractional time delay dynamic system (FTDD) to describe the local outbreak of COVID-19. The fractional derivative is introduced to account for the sub-diffusion process of the confirmed and cured peoples growth. Based on the public health data by the government, we propose a stable reconstruction algorithm of the coefficients. The reconstructed coefficients are used to predict the trend of the Corona-Virus.

Using a national prospective cohort, we estimated associations between exposure to first-dose ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccination and hematological and vascular adverse events using a nested incident-matched case-control study and a confirmatory self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis. An association was found between ChAdOx1 vaccination and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) (0-27 d after vaccination; adjusted rate ratio (aRR) = 5.77, 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.41-13.83), with an estimated incidence of 1.13 (0.62-1.63) cases per 100,000 doses. An SCCS analysis confirmed that this was unlikely due to bias (RR = 1.98 (1.29-3.02)). There was also an increased risk for arterial thromboembolic events (aRR = 1.22, 1.12-1.34) 0-27 d after vaccination, with an SCCS RR of 0.97 (0.93-1.02). For hemorrhagic events 0-27 d after vaccination, the aRR was 1.48 (1.12-1.96), with an SCCS RR of 0.95 (0.82-1.11). A first dose of ChAdOx1 was found to be associated with small increased risks of ITP, with suggestive evidence of an increased risk of arterial thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events. The attenuation of effect found in the SCCS analysis means that there is the potential for overestimation of the reported results, which might indicate the presence of some residual confounding or confounding by indication. Public health authorities should inform their jurisdictions of these relatively small increased risks associated with ChAdOx1. No positive associations were seen between BNT162b2 and thrombocytopenic, thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events.","Simpson, C R; Shi, T; Vasileiou, E; Katikireddi, S V; Kerr, S; Moore, E; McCowan, C; Agrawal, U; Shah, S A; Ritchie, L D; Murray, J; Pan, J; Bradley, D T; Stock, S J; Wood, R; Chuter, A; Beggs, J; Stagg, H R; Joy, M; Tsang, R S M; de Lusignan, S; Hobbs, R; Lyons, R A; Torabi, F; Bedston, S; O039,; Leary, M; Akbari, A; McMenamin, J; Robertson, C; Sheikh, A",Nat Med,,585

As functional activity of immune cells is determined by coordinated activity of signaling pathways, we developed mRNA-based JAK-STAT signaling pathway activity assays to quantitatively measure the cellular immune response on Affymetrix expression microarray data of various types of blood samples from virally infected patients (influenza, RSV, dengue, yellow fever, rotavirus) or vaccinated individuals, and to determine vaccine immunogenicity. JAK-STAT1/2 pathway activity was increased in blood samples of patients with viral, but not bacterial, infection and was higher in influenza compared to RSV-infected patients, reflecting known differences in immunogenicity. High JAK-STAT3 pathway activity was associated with more severe RSV infection. In contrast to inactivated influenza virus vaccine, live yellow fever vaccine did induce JAK-STAT1/2 pathway activity in blood samples, indicating superior immunogenicity. Normal (healthy) JAK-STAT1/2 pathway activity was established, enabling assay interpretation without the need for a reference sample. The JAK-STAT pathway assays enable measurement of cellular immune response for prognosis, therapy stratification, vaccine development, and clinical testing.","Bouwman, Wilbert; Verhaegh, Wim; Holtzer, Laurent; van de Stolpe, Anja",Front Immunol,,585

However, a number of studies have reported that adolescents are significantly less susceptible than older adults. Summer 2020 provided an opportunity to examine data on prevalence since after months of lockdowns, with the easing of restrictions, people were mingling, leading to surges in cases. METHODS: We examined data from Departments of Health websites in six U.S. states experiencing surges in cases to determine prevalence of COVID-19, and two prevalence-related measures, in adolescents and youth as compared to older adults. The two other measures related to prevalence were: (Percentage of cases observed in a given age group) ÷ (percentage of cases expected based on population demographics); and percentage deviation, or [(% observed-% expected)/ % expected] x 100. RESULTS: Prevalence of COVID-19 for adolescents and for youth was significantly greater than for older adults (p < .00001), as was percentage observed ÷ percentage expected (p < .005). The percentage deviation was significantly greater in adolescents/youth than in older adults (p < 0.00001) when there was an excess of observed cases over what was expected, and significantly less when observed cases were fewer than expected (p< 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results are contrary to previous findings that adolescents are less susceptible than older adults. Possible reasons for the findings are suggested, and we note that public health messaging targeting adolescents and youth might be helpful in curbing the pandemic. Also, the findings of the potential for high transmission among adolescents and youth, should be factored into decisions regarding school reopening.","Rumain, Barbara; Schneiderman, Moshe; Geliebter, Allan",PLoS One,,585

(Special Issue: Safety & CoVid-19.),2021,"Purpose: To evaluate the results of operating an in-hospital coronavirus disease 2019 screening station on an outpatient basis and to identify the effectiveness and necessity of such a screening station. Patients and Methods: This cross-sectional study included 1345 individuals who were tested for COVID-19 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at an in-hospital screening station on an outpatient basis. The subjects were healthcare workers (HCWs) with suspected COVID-19 symptoms or exposure to patients with confirmed COVID-19, caregivers at the hospital for complete enumeration, and patients who were scheduled to be admitted to a nonrestricted area in the hospital or to visit for outpatient treatment, but had suspected COVID-19 symptoms. The subjects were divided and compared as follows: HCW versus non-HCW groups and RT-PCR positive versus negative groups. Results: A total of 140 had symptoms, 291 wanted to be tested, and 664 were asymptomatic but were screened. Seven subjects had positive results for COVID-19. Compared with the non-HCWs, the HCWs were younger and had a lower rate of underlying medical conditions. In addition, there were more women, individuals with exposure to confirmed cases, and individuals with symptoms or those who just wanted to be tested. The frequency of all symptoms was high among the HCWs. The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that the HCWs were significantly associated with the presence of symptoms, having an odds ratio of 23.317 (confidence interval, 15.142-35.907L;P &lt; 0.001). The positive group had a high rate of exposure to patients with confirmed COVID-19 and had more subjects with symptoms or those who wanted to be tested. Conclusion: In-hospital screening stations are a relatively safe way to protect and support HCWs and to reduce and manage the spread of infection within the hospital effectively during an outbreak in the community.","Choi, H.

However, moving from face-to-face to online learning for many of us academics is intimidating, and appears even more difficult without the help of a team of technologists. In this paper, we describe our approach, our experiences and the lessons we learnt from converting a Primer in Systematic Reviews face-to-face workshop to a 6-week online course designed for healthcare professionals in Africa. We learnt that the team needs a balance of skills and experience, including technical know-how and content knowledge; that the learning strategies needed to achieve the learning objectives must match the content delivery. The online approach should result in both building knowledge and developing skills, and include interactive and participatory approaches. Finally, the design and delivery needs to keep in mind the limited and expensive internet access in some resource-poor settings in Africa.","McCaul, Michael; Durao, Solange; Kredo, Tamara; Garner, Paul; Young, Taryn; Rohwer, Anke",BMJ Evid.

499524,[Development of the risk assessment system for preventive measures against COVID-19 at the workplace],2021,"Contrary to real-life conditions, previous assessment methods used for mobile air purifiers (MAP) were based on the instant removal of high particle concentrations from a homogeneous distribution. Furthermore, the reduction of parameters as well as the balancing of additional virus loads in the room were not taken into account, which are the result of continuous MAP noise levels and consequently forced louder speech. In the simulation model of a typical classroom, the MAP distance to the (unknown) virus source proved to be a significant determining factor of the purifier function. A concentration gradient built up, which at a distance of 8 m caused a retention time of 10 min, after which virus particles first reached the MAP in a strongly diluted form. By balancing the continuous noise being emitted from the MAP in operation, the virus load in the classroom increased and could only be completely removed again in a few conformations (small distance to the source, high volume flow) or reached a minimal reduction compared to the load without an MAP operating.","Seipp, H.

499958,Differentially Private Health Tokens for Estimating COVID-19 Risk,2020-06-25,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious viral infection. Hospitals worldwide have decreased face-to-face visits to reduce the exposure to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Prenatal and postpartum care are essential for the health of women and their fetuses. Therefore, many hospitals have incorporated telehealth into their protocols. Objectives: The aim of this review was to determine how health care organizations are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic by incorporating telehealth visits into their protocols for obstetrics care, what services were converted to telehealth, and its benefits and barriers. Method: A computerized literature search was performed using PubMed and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases using terms, including ""telehealth,"" ""virtual visits,"" ""obstetric,"" ""pregnancy,"" ""postpartum,"" and ""COVID-19"" for articles published before October 2020. Peer reviewed articles and guidelines were included in this review. Results: A total of 25 articles were identified. Fifteen articles reported protocols. During this pandemic, protocols developed replaced some in-person visits with telehealth visits, when no testing or vaccinations are required. The main reported benefits were minimizing exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and the continuity to provide high-quality and safe care. Lack of access to high-speed internet and hardware and inaccessibility to patients were the most reported barriers. Conclusion: Telehealth provided the opportunity for reducing in-person visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some prenatal services could be completely provided through telehealth and others require medical equipment to be delivered. Health care organizations recognized that using telehealth could be continued beyond this pandemic, as they provided many benefits for patients, medical staff, and the organizations themselves.","Almuslim, Hameeda; AlDossary, Sharifah",Telemed. j. e. health,,585

500277,COVID-19 and the Precarity of Low-income Migrant Workers in Indian Cities,2021,"This report provides perspectives concerning dual roles of serum ferritin as a measure of both iron status and inflammation. We suggest benefits of a lower range of serum ferritin as has occurred for total serum cholesterol and fasting blood glucose levels. Observations during a prospective randomized study using phlebotomy in patients with peripheral arterial disease offered unique insights into dual roles of serum ferritin both as an iron status marker and acute phase reactant. Robust positive associations between serum ferritin, interleukin 6 [IL-6], tissue necrosis factor-alpha, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein were discovered. Elevated serum ferritin and IL-6 levels associated with increased mortality and with reduced mortality at ferritin levels <100 ng mL-1. Epidemiologic studies demonstrate similar outcomes. Extremely elevated ferritin and IL-6 levels also occur in individuals with high mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Disordered iron metabolism reflected by a high range of serum ferritin level signals disease severity and outcomes. Based upon experimental and epidemiologic data, we suggest testing the hypotheses that optimal ferritin levels for cardiovascular mortality reduction range from 20 to 100 ng mL-1 with % transferrin levels from 20 to 50%, to ensure adequate iron status and that ferritin levels above 194 ng mL-1 associate with all-cause mortality in population cohorts.","DePalma, Ralph G; Hayes, Virginia W; O039,; Leary, Timothy J",Metallomics (Print),,585
500413,Covid-19 prevalence and empty college seats,2021,"Overdiagnosis of anaphylaxis risk is an underappreciated aspect of anaphylaxis prevention. Whereas the benefits of anaphylaxis-risk prevention are well known, potential harms resulting from preemptive approaches to mitigate anaphylaxis-risk are not insignificant. Still, great progress has been made in recent years to avoid the unintended consequences of anaphylaxis-risk overdiagnosis. Reflection on recent advances in the use of diagnostic testing, as well as the application of diagnostic labels, provides an important perspective to understand how far the specialty of allergy and immunology has come in improving the lives of patients and families. Examples of recent paradigm shifts in anaphylaxis-risk management include approaches to peanut allergy prevention without screening, deferral of corticosteroids to prevent biphasic anaphylaxis reactions, reevaluation of reflex use of emergency medical services for resolved community anaphylaxis, and an approach to penicillin allergy delabeling with direct oral challenge. Routine medical practices to decrease anaphylaxis risk can have lifelong impacts for patients-beyond just preventing anaphylaxis. As our understanding of these trade-offs evolves, it becomes necessary to weigh both the benefits and the harms of past management approaches. Because medicine remains a science of uncertainty and an art of probability, a critical approach to risk mitigation remains necessary to find the often-elusive balance in anaphylaxis prevention.","Abrams, Elissa M; Greenhawt, Matthew; Alqurashi, Waleed; Singer, Alexander G; Shaker, Marcus",J.

500474,Resident Leadership in the Era of COVID-19: Harnessing Emotional Intelligence,2020,"Mask wearing has been advocated by public health officials as a way to reduce the spread of COVID-19. In the United States, policies on mask wearing have varied from state to state over the course of the pandemic. Even as more and more states encourage or even mandate mask wearing, many citizens still resist the notion. Our research examines mask wearing policy and adherence in association with COVID-19 case rates. We used state-level data on mask wearing policy for the general public and on proportion of residents who stated they always wear masks in public. For all 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC), these data were abstracted by month for April â September 2020 to measure their impact on COVID-19 rates in the subsequent month (May â October 2020). Monthly COVID-19 case rates (number of cases per capita over two weeks) >200 per 100,000 residents were considered high. Fourteen of the 15 states with no mask wearing policy for the general public through September reported a high COVID-19 rate. Of the 8 states with at least 75% mask adherence, none reported a high COVID-19 rate. States with the lowest levels of mask adherence were most likely to have high COVID-19 rates in the subsequent month, independent of mask policy or demographic factors. Mean COVID-19 rates for states with at least 75% mask adherence in the preceding month was 109.26 per 100,000 compared to 249.99 per 100,000 for those with less adherence. Our analysis suggests high adherence to mask wearing could be a key factor in reducing the spread of COVID-19. This association between high mask adherence and reduced COVID-19 rates should influence policy makers and public health officials to focus on ways to improve mask adherence across the population in order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.","Fischer, Charlie B; Adrien, Nedghie; Silguero, Jeremiah J; Hopper, Julianne J; Chowdhury, Abir I; Werler, Martha M",PLoS One,,585
500548,"COVID-19: high-resolution computed tomography findings in the first 64 patients admitted to the Hospital of Cremona, the epicentre of the pandemic in Europe",2021,"OBJECTIVES: We apply a general case replacement framework for quantifying the robustness of causal inferences to characterize the uncertainty of findings from clinical trials. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We express the robustness of inferences as the amount of data that must be replaced to change the conclusion and relate this to the fragility of trial results used for dichotomous outcomes. We illustrate our approach in the context of an RCT of hydroxychloroquine on pneumonia in COVID-19 patients and a cumulative meta-analysis of the effect of antihypertensive treatments on stroke. RESULTS: We developed the Robustness of an Inference to Replacement (RIR), which quantifies how many treatment cases with positive outcomes would have to be replaced with hypothetical patients who did not receive a treatment to change an inference. The RIR addresses known limitations of the Fragility Index by accounting for the observed rates of outcomes. It can be used for varying thresholds for inference, including clinical importance. CONCLUSION: Because the RIR expresses uncertainty in terms of patient experiences, it is more relatable to stakeholders than P-values alone. It helps identify when results are statistically significant, but conclusions are not robust, while considering the rareness of events in the underlying data.","Frank, Kenneth A; Lin, Qinyun; Maroulis, Spiro; Mueller, Anna S; Xu, Ran; Rosenberg, Joshua M; Hayter, Christopher S; Mahmoud, Ramy A; Kolak, Marynia; Dietz, Thomas; Zhang, Lixin",J Clin Epidemiol,,585

500822,Responding to COVID-19 Among U.S. Military Units in South Korea: The U.S. Forces Korea's Operation Kill the Virus,2021,"ABSTRACT: We describe the case of a patient, hospitalized in a California community medical ICU for over a month, with severe neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), unresponsive to medical management, but responsive to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). We discuss the medical, logistical, and legal challenges in providing ECT in this setting. We also describe a previously unpublished use of dexmedetomidine, which aided in the safe and rapid reduction of benzodiazepines and permitted a successful ECT course. The rapid delivery and efficacy of ECT were essential because of the burgeoning coronavirus pandemic. The patient's treatment required exemplary efforts by providers across multiple disciplines, ongoing medicolegal consultation with the county mental health medical director, as well as consultation with expert members of the International Society for ECT and Neurostimulation. We conclude with a discussion of the unique challenges of providing emergency ECT to patients in California, including during a serious pandemic, when courts are closed. This case illustrates the importance of cultivating and maintaining high-quality ECT expertise in community hospitals and keeping ECT services available even during pandemics. Also, this case demonstrates that ECT is not ""merely an elective procedure"" but a vital, life-saving treatment, even during the era of COVID-19. To our knowledge, this is the first such published case of emergency ECT performed in California.","Rajan, Rajani; Sage, Mary",J ECT,,585

Solid organ transplants (SOTs) are life-saving interventions, recently challenged by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SOTs require a multistep process, which can be affected by COVID-19 at several phases. Methods. SOT-specialists, COVID-19-specialists, and medical ethicists designed an international survey according to CHERRIES guidelines. Personal opinions about continuing SOTs, safe managing of donors and recipients, as well as equity of resources' allocation were investigated. The survey was sent by e-mail. Multiple approaches were used (corresponding authors from Scopus, websites of scientific societies, COVID-19 webinars). After the descriptive analysis, univariate and multivariate ordinal regression analysis was performed. Results. There were 1819 complete answers from 71 countries. The response rate was 49%. Data were stratified according to region, macrospecialty, and organ of interest. Answers were analyzed using univariate-multivariate ordinal regression analysis and thematic analysis. Overall, 20% of the responders thought SOTs should not stop (continue transplant without restriction);over 70% suggested SOTs should selectively stop, and almost 10% indicated they should completely stop. Furthermore, 82% agreed to shift resources from transplant to COVID-19 temporarily. Briefly, main reason for not stopping was that if the transplant will not proceed, the organ will be wasted. Focusing on SOT from living donors, 61% stated that activity should be restricted only to ""urgent"" cases. At the multivariate analysis, factors identified in favor of continuing transplant were Italy, ethicist, partially disagreeing on the equity question, a high number of COVID-19-related deaths on the day of the answer, a high IHDI country. Factors predicting to stop SOTs were Europe except-Italy, public university hospital, and strongly agreeing on the equity question. Conclusions. In conclusion, the majority of responders suggested that transplant activity should be continued through the implementation of isolation measures and the adoption of the COVID-19-free pathways.

Unfortunately, isolation of plants undergoing potent gene silencing requires laborious design, visual screening, and physical separation for downstream characterization. Here, we developed an adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APT)-based RNA interference (RNAi) technology (APTi) in Physcomitrella patens that improves upon the multiple limitations of current RNAi techniques. APTi exploits the pro-survival output of transiently silencing APT in the presence of 2-fluoradenine, thereby establishing survival itself as a reporter of RNAi. To maximize the silencing efficacy of gene targets, we created vectors that facilitate insertion of any gene target sequence in tandem with the APT silencing motif. We tested the efficacy of APTi with two gene families, the actin-dependent motor, myosin XI (a,b), and the putative chitin receptor Lyk5 (a,b,c). The APTi approach resulted in a homogenous population of transient P. patens mutants specific for our gene targets with zero surviving background plants within 8 days. The observed mutants directly corresponded to a maximal 93% reduction of myosin XI protein and complete loss of chitin-induced calcium spiking in the Lyk5-RNAi background. The positive selection nature of APTi represents a fundamental improvement in RNAi technology and will contribute to the growing demand for technologies amenable to high-throughput phenotyping.","Orr, Robert G; Foley, Stephen J; Sherman, Catherine A; Abreu, Isidro; Galotto, Giulia; Liu, Boyuan; Gonzalez-Guerrero, Manuel; Vidali, Luis",Plant physiol,,585

An Egyptian experience,2020,"Introduction - In the context of the Covid-19 outbreak, as soon as the government announced a general lockdown on 17 March, the French national public health agency set up a surveillance system to monitor the adoption of preventive behaviors by the population The objective was to estimate the level of systematic adoption of the prevention measures recommended by the public authorities according to the characteristics of the population (socio-demographic, living conditions related to the Covid-19 epidemic and lockdown), identify the associated cognitive and affective factors (perceptions and knowledge) and monitor their trends during the lockdown period Methods - Independent samples of 2,000 people aged 18 and over living in metropolitan France were interviewed via the Internet The data presented are from five waves of surveys A total of 10,013 participants were interviewed between 30 March and 6 May 2020 The main variable of interest was the number of measures systematically adopted out of the 7 recommended by the public authorities The explanatory variables were grouped into three distinct blocks of variables: 1/sociodemographic variables;2/living conditions related to the Covid-19 outbreak and lockdown variables;3/cognitive and affective variables In order to quantify the strength of the association between the number of measures systematically adopted and the explanatory variables, multiple linear regressions, adjusted for sex, age, SPC, and waves of survey were performed Results - Our results showed that the French adopted, during the lockdown period, a high number of preventive measures, whatever the population profiles, with on average over the 5 waves of survey, more than 5 measures systematically adopted out of the 7 recommended by the public authorities Some differences according to the population profiles were observed Men, younger people, SPC- and inactive people, people with lower health literacy, people who reported continuing to work outside their home, people who did not have a relative with Covid-19 symptoms took fewer preventive measures During the lockdown period, the number of systematically adopted measures decreased The systematic adoption of these measures was mainly explained by cognitive and affective determinants The three main ones were the subjective norms (approval and adoption of measures by relatives), the perceived ability to adopt the preventive measures and, to a lesser extent, the perceived severity of the disease Conclusions - In order to promote the adoption of preventive behaviors in the population, our data suggest that priority should be given to strengthening the social norms of adoption of these behaviors and the capacities of individuals to implement them To this end, it will be important to communicate clearly and simply on the modes of transmission of the virus, on preventive measures to be adopted, and to create opportunities in the physical and social environment to facilitate their implementation (access to protective equipment, organization of physical distancing) According to a social marketing approach, the communication strategy would benefit from valuing a social norm for adopting prevention measures for oneself and for others, targeting in particular young adults and men","Lasbeur, L.; Lecrique, J.

502781,COVID-19 epidemic prediction and the impact of public health interventions: A review of COVID-19 epidemic models,2021,"Recurrent mentions of a forensic science crisis are reported in the literature. Some 15 years ago, the discussion was focused on the backlog problem. Other issues have been regularly debated since then, including the risk of error, need for independence, importance and risk of contextualisation, increasing fragmentation into separate processes and specialisations. Proposed solutions to solve one problem often led to other issues in other parts of the process. This paper attempts to address the apparent crisis using a different perspective, through a comparison with established disciplines, namely material science, medicine and historical science. The comparison with material science shows that, despite the varied organisational and legal models and the interdisciplinary nature of the field, a common element to all forensic science endeavours exists: the trace. A greater focus on the trace might thus help the development of a holistic approach in forensic science. The comparison with medicine demonstrates that, through the overall process, the main risk shifts from the risk to overlook important hypotheses or traces at the beginning of the process (e.g. problems in the detection of traces/symptoms and formulation of hypotheses) to the risk of supporting the wrong hypothesis at the end of the process (e.g. erroneous test of the hypotheses/diagnostic). Further, in medicine, symptoms are rarely evaluated in isolation, while traces are often evaluated separately. By analogy, epidemiology illustrates forensic science's critical role in preventing crime through forensic intelligence, supporting a more extensive and more collaborative application of forensic science in security issues. The comparison with historical science also indicates that a single trace (i.e. the observed effect) is rarely sufficient to reason on its cause. Retrodiction (abduction) is proposed as an alternative reasoning approach to reconstruct events from the past based on signs uncovered in the present. Finally, the impact of science in investigating crimes is presented as an evolving process. A new trace or information can bring an entirely different light on the reconstruction of past events or prevention of future issues. Thus, issues or challenges in the first stages of the process (i.e., crime scene investigation) should be addressed in priority for subsequent stages to function correctly.","Weyermann, Céline; Roux, Claude",Forensic Sci Int,,585
502816,Global to local impacts on atmospheric CO2 caused by COVID-19 lockdown,2020-10-25,"We reviewed the electronic medical records (EMR) of patients hospitalized during the peak of the pandemic, March 1st through March 31st, to document the type and frequency of neurological problems seen in patients with COVID-19 at presentation to the emergency room. Secondary aims were to determine: 1) the frequency of neurological complaints during the hospital stay; 2) whether the presence of any neurological complaint at presentation or any of the individual types of neurological complaints at admission predicted three separate outcomes: death, length of hospital stay, or the need for intubation; and 3) if the presence of any neurological complaint or any of the individual types of neurological complaints developed during hospital stay predicted the previous three outcomes. Setting: The Louisiana Health Sciences Center - New Orleans Institutional Review Board and the University Medical Center Clinical Research Review Committee approved the study protocol. Data acquisition: We reviewed the electronic medical records (EMR) of patients hospitalized during March (March 1st through March 31st) 2020 at the University Medical Center New Orleans (UMCNO), who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the same hospitalization. The EMR team generated a list of 257 patients admitted for COVID-19. We excluded seven patients because of a negative COVID-19 test result or incomplete medical record documentation. Three neurology residents (DC, MS, DB) reviewed the EMR in detail to capture the relevant medical history, clinical course, and laboratory test results and abstracted data into an electronic data collection spreadsheet.We recorded the presentation or development of the following neurological complaints: headache, syncope, altered mental status, seizure, status epilepticus, and ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Statistical analysis: We used ""R"" (statistics software) and Microsoft Excel to generate summary tables. To analyse hospital length of stay or death, we fitted a competing risks proportional hazards model for time to discharge or death using the crr() function in R version 4.0.0. The competing risks model allowed the analysis of hospital stay, taking into account that the censoring of cases due to death was not random. To predict the likelihood of intubation, we used the glm() function in R to fit a logistic regression model. For each model, we determined baseline demographic variables predictive of the outcomes and generated adjusted models. For variables with less than five cases per cell, we reported the p-values for Fisher's Exact Test.The analyses and results are published in:Chachkhiani, David et al.

However, clinical trials have revealed that the co-administration of CQ and AZM resulted in severe side effects, including cardiac arrhythmia, in patients with COVID-19. To elucidate the cardiotoxicity induced by CQ and AZM, we examined the effects of these drugs based on the electrophysiological properties of human embryonic stem cellderived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) using multi-electrode arrays. CQ treatment significantly increased the field potential duration, which corresponds to prolongation of the QT interval, and decreased the spike amplitude, spike slope, and conduction velocity of hESC-CMs. AZM had no significant effect on the field potentials of hESC-CMs. However, CQ in combination with AZM greatly increased the field potential duration and decreased the beat period and spike slope of hESC-CMs when compared with CQ monotherapy.

Currently, reverse transcription quantitative qPCR (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. However, the sensitivity of RT-qPCR assays of pharyngeal swab samples are reported to vary from 30% to 60%. More accurate and sensitive methods are urgently needed to support the quality assurance of the RT-qPCR or as an alternative diagnostic approach. A reverse transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) method was established and evaluated. To explore the feasibility of RT-dPCR in diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2, a total of 196 clinical pharyngeal swab samples from 103 suspected patients, 77 close contacts and 16 supposed convalescents were analyzed by RT-qPCR and then measured by the proposed RT-dPCR. For the 103 fever suspected patients, 19 (19/25) negative and 42 (42/49) equivocal tested by RT-qPCR were positive according to RT-dPCR. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection was significantly improved from 28.2% by RT-qPCR to 87.4% by RT-dPCR. For 29 close contacts (confirmed by additional sample and clinical follow up), 16 (16/17) equivocal and 1 negative tested by RT-qPCR were positive according to RT-dPCR, which is implying that the RT-qPCR is missing a lot of asymptomatic patients. The overall sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-dPCR were 91%, 100% and 93%, respectively. RT-dPCR is highly accurate method and suitable for detection of pharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 suspected patients and patients under isolation and observation who may not be exhibiting clinical symptoms.","Dong, Lianhua; Zhou, Junbo; Niu, Chunyan; Wang, Quanyi; Pan, Yang; Sheng, Sitong; Wang, Xia; Zhang, Yongzhuo; Yang, Jiayi; Liu, Manqing; Zhao, Yang; Zhang, Xiaoying; Zhu, Tao; Peng, Tao; Xie, Jie; Gao, Yunhua; Wang, Di; Dai, Xinhua; Fang, Xiang",Talanta,,585

Hopefully, a new vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be developed in the near future, and perhaps even one for human immunodeficiency virus. Although the effectiveness of vaccinations has been proven over the years and adverse effects to currently available vaccinations are extremely rare, many people continue to defer immunizations for themselves and their families. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this phenomenon, known as ""vaccine hesitancy,"" is a major public health problem globally. This review summarizes the unproven adverse effects of various vaccines and stresses the importance of enforcing vaccination policies to minimize vaccine hesitancy. Every effort should be made to improve existing vaccines and to produce new ones, according to carefully designed scientific preclinical and clinical trials. This is particularly important in today's era, in light of the global transparency regarding vaccination development, and the potential for future pandemics such as COVID-19.","Etzioni-Friedman, Tamar; Etzioni, Amos",Acta Haematol,,585

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend that patients should be risk-assessed for pressure ulcers and measures instated to prevent such complication. In this study, we report case series of perioral pressure ulcers developed following the use of two devices to secure endotracheal tubes in COVID-19 positive patients managed in the intensive care setting. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on sixteen patients identified to have perioral pressure ulcers by using the institutional risk management system. Data parameters included patient demographics (age, gender, comorbidities, smoking history and body mass index (BMI)). Data collection included the indication of admission to ITU, duration of intubation, types of medical devices utilised to secure the endotracheal tube, requirement of vasopressor agents and renal replacement therapy, presence of other associated ulcers, duration of proning and mortality. Results: Sixteen patients developed different patterns of perioral pressure ulcers related to the use of two medical devices (Insight, AnchorFast). The mean age was 58.6 years. The average length of intubation was 18.8 days. Fourteen patients required proning, with an average duration of 5.2 days. Conclusions: The two devices utilised to secure endotracheal tubes are associated with unique patterns of facial pressure ulcers. Measures should be taken to assess the skin regularly and avoid utilising devices that are associated with a high risk of facial pressure ulcers.

504515,A narrative review on characterization of acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19-infected lungs using artificial intelligence,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Older adults might be less information-seeking in comparison to younger adults. Yet, when a crisis hits, rather than relying on only a few information sources, it is important for people to gather information from a variety of different sources. With more information sources, people are more likely to obtain a more realistic perception of the situation and engagement of health behaviors. This study examined the association between age and information-seeking patterns, and how information-seeking patterns influenced worry about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and protective measures taken during the pandemic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was conducted from March to May 2020. Ninety younger adults and 105 older adults were recruited in a 21-day daily diary study. Participants reported the types of sources where they received COVID-19-related information, worry from these information sources and protective health behaviors performed each day. Multilevel serial mediation analysis was performed. RESULTS: Concurrent and time-lagged analyses both revealed that older adults received information from more sources, and more frequently from traditional (e.g., newspaper and TV) and interpersonal sources (e.g., information shared by friends and families), than did younger adults. When receiving information from more sources, older adults were more worried about COVID-19 and performed more protective health behaviors. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These results demonstrated the utility of having more information sources in the context of a public health crisis and offered suggestions for future public communication and community engagement.","Chu, Li; Fung, Helene H; Tse, Dwight C K; Tsang, Vivian H L; Zhang, Hanyu; Mai, Chunyan",Gerontologist,,585

A Mobile Serious Game about the Pandemic: Design and Evaluation Study,2020,"AIMS: To explore the impact of the coronavirus disease lockdown on diabetes patients living in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in terms of their compliance with medication intake and lifestyle habits, and quality of life. METHODS: In this cross-sectional, qualitative prospective study, a questionnaire was administered over the telephone to diabetes patients who had attended National Guard primary care centers in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The survey included questions on demographic data, type of diabetes, medications used, comorbidities, medication compliance, and daily habits before and after the lockdown, and those assessing patients' psychological parameters during the past month by using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Data analysis was performed using SPSS program version 26. RESULTS: Totally, 394 patients participated. All of them had type 2 diabetes, and 37.6% had only one comorbidity. Antidiabetic monotherapy was used in 76.4% of the patients, while combination therapy was used in 23.6%. The compliance score before the lockdown was significantly higher (18.49 ± 3.05) than that after it (17.40 ± 3.25) (p-value <0.001). The average psychological assessment score was 9.78 ± 4.14 (range 8-35). Male participants and smokers had a significantly better psychological status than female participants (p-value = 0.002) and non-smokers (p value < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The patients' levels of compliance with medications and healthy lifestyle habits were significantly reduced after the lockdown. These findings highlight the need for healthcare professionals to encourage diabetes patients to adhere to healthy lifestyle habits and use telemedicine during lockdowns to ensure optimal blood glucose control and reduce the incidence of complications.","Alshareef, Reem; Al Zahrani, Abdullah; Alzahrani, Alhussain; Ghandoura, Lama",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,585

505237,A conversation on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on junior researchers' careers with funders and university leaders,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has led to one of the world's largest infectious disease outbreaks. COVID-19 first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and the emergence was especially concerning to the U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) stationed in the Republic of Korea (ROK, South Korea), which remains vital to peace and security of the East Asian region. The first wave of cases emerged in South Korea from China before a globally established response, which forced USFK into a challenging position to combat a novel virus with countless unknowns regarding effective control and portended impact. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As cases began to emerge in South Korea, USFK in early February began to proactively formulate peninsula-wide preventative health measures to protect the force. Eventually, USFK spearheaded a uniquely proactive Operation Kill the Virus that targeted COVID-19 as an enemy that must be rigorously defended against. Through the operation, USFK systematically employed eight key principles to successfully combat the pandemic, which are documented in this article. RESULTS: The operation's eight principles focused on (1) Treat it like a combat operation, (2) Protect the force to protect the mission, (3) Stay one step ahead of the curve by exercising an abundance of caution, (4) Use predictive analysis, (5) Maintain open and transparent dialog with the community every day, (6) Be empathetic but prepare the community for lifestyle and culture changes, (7) Follow and enforce rules, and finally (8) Keep your foot on the gas and fight complacency. By closely collaborating with the ROK government, especially the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USFK effectively limited the number of locally acquired cases, including service members, families, and civilians, to 24 by April 2020. Vital to that success was ensuring a sufficient capability and capacity to test, trace, treat, and logistically support with personal protective equipment and sufficient infrastructure for quarantine and isolation. As the pandemic shifted to the USA and Europe, new cases in the ROK shifted from locally acquired to imported from international travelers. Fundamental to USFK's sustained preservation of readiness and training included aggressive quarantine and testing of all arrivals from the United States of America (USA), identification of hotspots in all installations, and perpetual fine-tuning of the operation's principles in collaboration with the ROK's aggressive approach to eradicate COVID-19 from the peninsula. CONCLUSIONS: In successfully executing the operation, USFK imparts three main lessons for future outbreaks. First, a military command should execute a health response similar to how it executes combat operations against a battlefield enemy. Second, the command should maintain flexibility to new changes or risks that alter courses of action. And finally, engagement with the local community, host nation, and international partners should not be compromised when formulating strategies. The USFK's immediate recognition of the public health threat by all levels of leadership and medical personnel enabled a unique and highly effective Operation Kill the Virus that engaged all members of the community, both local and international.","Kim, Sharon Y; Lee, Kenny; Tussey, Jason B; Dougherty, Eric J; Williams, Stephen C; Abrams, Robert B; Murray, Clinton K",Mil. med,,585
505601,Nursing Faculty Experience with Online Distance Education during COVID -19 Crisis: A Qualitative Study,2021,"INTRODUCTION: A reduction in the number of interventional cardiology procedures has emerged as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey was performed to quantify this decrease and the impact on the management of myocardial infarction in Latin America. METHODS: A telematic survey was conducted for all countries in Latin America. Diagnostic catheterisations, coronary and structural interventions, as well as the incidence and delay to reperfusion therapy of myocardial infarction (STEMI), were recorded. Two periods were compared: from 24 February to 8 March 2020 (pre-COVID-19) and another 2­week period that varied according to country (COVID-19). RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 79 centres in 20 countries. There was a significant decrease in the number of diagnostic procedures (-65.2%), coronary interventions (-59.4%), structural therapeutics (-86.1%) and STEMI care (-51.2%). A decrease was noted in the incidence of STEMI, but also a delay in the time to STEMI reperfusion. While there was a variation in activity in interventional cardiology between countries, patient behaviour was rather homogeneous. CONCLUSIONS: A significant reduction in healthcare activity has been noted during the COVID-19 pandemic, including STEMI care, with the risk of increased mortality and/or morbidity following STEMI. Healthcare providers should encourage patients with suspected symptoms of STEMI to call for emergency care to ensure rapid diagnosis and timely reperfusion treatment.","Mayol, J; Artucio, C; Batista, I; Puentes, A; Villegas, J; Quizpe, R; Rojas, V; Mangione, J; Belardi, J",Neth Heart J,,585

This study examines the psychometric properties of an app-based 6-minute walking test (6WT) and determines OFI in patients with lumbar DDD. METHODS: The maximum 6-minute walking distance (6WD) was determined in patients with lumbar DDD. The results were expressed as raw 6WDs (in meters), as well as in standardized z-scores referenced to age- and sex-specific values of spine-healthy volunteers. The 6WT results were assessed for reliability and content validity using established disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures. RESULTS: Seventy consecutive patients and 330 volunteers were enrolled. The mean 6WD was 370 m (SD 137 m) in patients with lumbar DDD. Significant correlations between 6WD and the Core Outcome Measures Index for the back (r = -0.31), Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) symptom severity (r = -0.32), ZCQ physical function (r = -0.33), visual analog scale (VAS) for back pain (r = -0.42), and VAS for leg pain (r = -0.32) were observed (all p < 0.05). The 6WT revealed good test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.82), and the standard error of measurement was 58.3 m. A 4-tier severity stratification classified patients with z-scores > -1 (no OFI), -1 to -1.9 (mild OFI), -2 to -2.9 (moderate OFI), and &#8804; -3 (severe OFI). CONCLUSIONS: The smartphone app-based self-measurement of the 6WT is a convenient, reliable, and valid way to determine OFI in patients with lumbar DDD. The 6WT app facilitates the digital evaluation and monitoring of patients with lumbar DDD.","Maldaner, Nicolai; Sosnova, Marketa; Zeitlberger, Anna M; Ziga, Michal; Gautschi, Oliver P; Regli, Luca; Weyerbrock, Astrid; Stienen, Martin N",J Neurosurg Spine,,585
506147,The systemic inflammatory response and clinicopathological characteristics in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection: Comparison of 2 consecutive cohorts,2021,"BACKGROUND: Kawasaki disease is an acute febrile systemic childhood vasculitis, which is suspected to be triggered by respiratory viral infections. We aimed to examine whether the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with an increase in the incidence of Kawasaki disease. METHODS: We did a quasi-experimental interrupted time series analysis over the past 15 years in a tertiary paediatric centre in the Paris region, a French epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak. The main outcome was the number of Kawasaki disease cases over time, estimated by quasi-Poisson regression. In the same centre, we recorded the number of hospital admissions from the emergency department (2005-2020) and the results of nasopharyngeal multiplex PCR to identify respiratory pathogens (2017-2020). These data were compared with daily hospital admissions due to confirmed COVID-19 in the same region, recorded by Public Health France. FINDINGS: Between Dec 1, 2005, and May 20, 2020, we included 230 patients with Kawasaki disease. The median number of Kawasaki disease hospitalisations estimated by the quasi-Poisson model was 1·2 per month (IQR 1·1-1·3). In April, 2020, we identified a rapid increase of Kawasaki disease that was related to SARS-CoV-2 (six cases per month; 497% increase [95% CI 72-1082]; p=0·0011), starting 2 weeks after the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic. SARS-CoV-2 was the only virus circulating intensely during this period, and was found in eight (80%) of ten patients with Kawasaki disease since April 15 (SARS-CoV-2-positive PCR or serology). A second peak of hospital admissions due to Kawasaki disease was observed in December, 2009 (six cases per month; 365% increase ([31-719]; p=0.0053), concomitant with the influenza A H1N1 pandemic. INTERPRETATION: Our study further suggests that viral respiratory infections, including SAR-CoV-2, could be triggers for Kawasaki disease and indicates the potential timing of an increase in incidence of the disease in COVID-19 epidemics. Health-care providers should be prepared to manage an influx of patients with severe Kawasaki disease, particularly in countries where the peak of COVID-19 has recently been reached.

The goal is to help inform the many healthcare professionals working with COVID-19 patients. A literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE databases. Hand searches were also undertaken using Google and reference lists to identify recent evidence. Studies were critically appraised, and the findings were analyzed by narrative synthesis. Nutritional status can impact immunity in several ways, including affecting susceptibility to infection, severity of disease, and recovery time, and is therefore a significant consideration in the management of COVID-19. COVID-19 can also impact digestive function, which can further impact nutritional status. The role of Vitamin D deficiency in vulnerability to severe respiratory infections, including COVID-19, has been recognized, and it may have a role in treatment where deficiency is indicated. Healthcare professionals should be aware that obesity may be accompanied by micronutrient malnutrition including vitamin D deficiency and alterations in the microbiome and inflammatory responses, which can further impact immunity and disease severity. Multidisciplinary team-work is recommended in the management of patients with COVID-19, and approaches should include a consideration of nutritional status (both macronutrients and micronutrients), body weight, and gastrointestinal signs and symptom.","Bold, Justine; Harris, Miranda; Fellows, Lindsey; Chouchane, Manal",Gastroenterol Hepatol Bed Bench,,585

508684,Role of digital technology in freshwater biodiversity monitoring through citizen science during COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Background: Recent studies have shown that patients diagnosed with coronarivus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and also with previous cardiovascular diseases have a higher mortality due to worsening heart disease. At the same time, patients without previous cardiovascular disease may also have cardiac complications due to episodes of myocarditis. The aim of this multicenter study was to assess high sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) in patients with COVID-19 and to evaluate the incidence of myocardial injury. Methods: In this multicenter study we enrolled 543 patients, 57.8% males, median age 63 years (range 18-99) from three selected hospitals: University Hospital Tor Vergata in Rome, Fondazione IRCCS Ca 'Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, in Milan, S Chiara Hospital in Trento. We measured hs-cTnT in all patients to assess myocardial injury and correlations with patient's age, symptoms and disease course. Results: The data showed that, among the 543 patients studied, 257 patients (47.3%) had hs-cTnT values higher than the upper reference limit (URL) of 14 ng/L. Patients with high hs-cTnT had more frequently fever (p <0.01) and respiratory symptoms (p <0.01), compared to the group with hs-cTnT values below URL. The results showed also that patients with hs-cTnT above URL had a higher frequency of previous cardiovascular disease (p <0.01) as well as of hypertension (p<0.01). Instead, among 231 patients with no previous cardiovascular disease, 81 (31.5%) had hs-cTnT values above the URL. Finally. the majority of the patients with high hs-cTnT were admitted to the intensive care unit (p< 0.01). Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the first multicenter study evaluating hs-cTnT in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Italy. Our data recommend the dosage of cardiac troponin in COVID-19 patients for an early diagnosis of myocardial injury.","Alfonso Perrone, Marco; Spolaore, Federica; Ammirabile, Massimiliano; Romeo, Francesco; Caciagli, Patrizio; Ceriotti, Ferruccio; Bernardini, Sergio",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,,585

Narrative Review,2020,"In Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, clinical examination and invasive procedures on the respiratory tract and on airway-connected cavities, such as paranasal sinuses and the middle ear, expose people to direct transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by inhalation or ocular projection of contaminated droplets, and to indirect transmission by contact with contaminated hands, objects or surfaces. Estimating an R0 of COVID-19 at around 3 justified postponing non-urgent face-to-face consultations and expanding the use of teleconsultation in order to limit the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection of patients or health workers and comply with the lockdown. The health authority recommends cancellation of all medical or surgical activities, which are not urgent as long as this does not involve a loss of chance for the patient. The purpose of this cancellation is to significantly increase critical care capacity, prioritise the reception of patients with COVID-19, prioritise the allocation of staff and provision of the equipment necessary for their medical or surgical management, and contribute to the smooth running of downstream critical care within their establishment. Another goal is to reduce the risks of patient contamination within healthcare facilities. This document provides guidance on how to proceed with and adapt ENT surgery in the current pandemic context, as well as on the management of postponed operations. This best practice advice must of course be adapted in each region according to the development of the epidemic and pre-existing arrangements. Their local application can only be decided within the framework of collaboration between the ENT teams, the operational hygiene units and all the other specialties concerned.","Couloigner, V; Schmerber, S; Nicollas, R; Coste, A; Barry, B; Makeieff, M; Boudard, P; Bequignon, E; Morel, N; Lescanne, E",Eur Ann Otorhinolaryngol Head Neck Dis,,585

Widespread public use of these items has imposed pressure on municipalities to properly collect and dispose of potentially infectious PPE. There has been a lack of structured monitoring efforts to quantify the emerging trend of improperly disposed of PPE debris. In this study, we present a baseline monitoring survey to describe the spatial distribution of PPE debris during the COVID-19 pandemic from the metropolitan city of Toronto, Canada. Our objectives were to: (1) quantify PPE debris types among surveyed areas and; (2) identify PPE debris densities and accumulation of surveyed areas. A total of 1306 PPE debris items were documented, with the majority being disposable gloves (44%), followed by face masks (31%), and disinfecting wipes (25%). Of the face masks, 97% were designed for single use while only 3% were reusable. Of the surveyed locations, the highest daily average densities of PPE debris were recorded in the large and medium-sized grocery store parking lots and the hospital district (0.00475 items/m2, 0.00160 items/m2, and 0.00133 items/m2 respectively). The two surveyed residential areas had the following highest PPE densities (0.00029 items/m2 and 0.00027 items/m2), while the recreational trail had the lowest densities (0.00020 items/m2). Assuming a business-as-usual accumulation, an estimated 14,298 PPE items will be leaked as debris in just the surveyed areas annually. To facilitate proper disposal of PPE debris by the public we recommend development of municipal efforts to improve PPE collection methods that are informed by the described PPE waste pathways.","Ammendolia, Justine; Saturno, Jacquelyn; Brooks, Amy L; Jacobs, Shoshanah; Jambeck, Jenna R",Environ Pollut,,585

This condition requires materials that can break the chain of transmission from human to human and from the environment to human. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of alcohol-based hand antiseptic using WHO-recommended formulation based on the stability of the formulation, the risk of irritation, and the ability to kill bacteria. Assessments on the presence of rancidity, clarity, discoloration, final alcohol content, and skin irritation risk were done to know the quality of the product. Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was used to assess the percentage of bacterial killing power. The selected bacteria were bacteria that are commonly found in the hospital environment. The results showed that from four variants tested, MK.IV had good stability compared to other formulations. In terms of irritation risk, twenty-three selected subjects could well tolerate the formula. The results of the killing efficacy against MRSA showed that the antiseptic could kill 99.90% of the bacteria at the 1st, 2nd, and 5th minute. A selected manufacturer's product also showed the same killing efficacy at the 1st, 2nd, and 5th minute.

512067,Supply and demand shocks in the COVID-19 pandemic: An industry and occupation perspective,2020-04-14,"BACKGROUND: The progressive SARS-CoV2 outbreaks worldwide have evoked global investigation. Despite the numerousin-silico approaches, the virus-host relationship remains a serious concern. MicroRNAs are the small non-coding RNAs that help in regulating gene profiling. The current study utilized miRNA prediction tools along with the PANTHER classification system to demonstrate association and sequence similarities shared between miRNAs of SARS-CoV2 and human host. METHOD: An in-silico approach was carried out using Vmir analyzer to predict miRNAs from SARS-CoV2 viral genomes. Predicted miRNAs from SARS-CoV2 viral genomes were used for effective hybridization sequence identification along the nucleotide similarities with human miRNAs from miRbase database. Further, it was proceeded to analyze the gene ontology using miRDB with PANTHER classification. RESULT: Based on the prediction and analysis, we have identified 22 potential miRNAs from five genomes of SARS-CoV2 linked with 12 human miRNAs. Analysis of human miRNAs hsa-mir-1267, hsa-mir-1-3p, hsa-mir-5683 were found shared between all the five viral SARS-CoV2 miRNAs. Further, PANTHER classification analyzed the gene-ontology being carried by these associations showed that 44 genes were involved in biological functions that includes genes specific for signaling pathway, immune complex generation, enzyme binding with effective role in the virus-host relationship. CONCLUSION: Our analysis concludes that the genes identified in this study can be effective in analyzing the virus-host interaction. It also provides a new direction to understand viral pathogenesis with a probable new way to link, that can be used to understand and relate the miRNAs of the virus to the host conditions.","Sarma, Abhijit; Phukan, Homen; Halder, Neha; Madanan, Madathiparambil Gopalakrishnan",Comput Biol Chem,,585
512095,COVID-19 - Insights and Impacts,2020,"BACKGROUND: Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disease primarily occurring in children, and commonly involves the bone and skin; gastrointestinal tract involvement is notably rare. The incidence and significance of gastrointestinal lesions in adult LCH are unclear; thus, we aimed to investigate adult Japanese cases of LCH and clarify the features of gastrointestinal involvement. METHODS: We gathered clinical information on 43 Japanese cases of adult LCH and analyzed patient backgrounds, affected organs, features of the gastrointestinal lesions, and the clinical courses. RESULTS: Thirteen patients underwent endoscopic examinations: an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy alone in 5, lower gastrointestinal endoscopy alone in 3, and both in 5 patients. A gastric lesion (one case), colonic lesion (one case), and both gastric and rectal lesions (one case) were detected. The three cases of gastrointestinal involvement also exhibited nongastrointestinal multisystem LCH lesions and showed no gastrointestinal symptoms or increased uptake on positron emission tomography. Endoscopy revealed small erosions without specific features; histological examinations were required for diagnosis. These three cases were treated with chemotherapy, comprising vinblastine/prednisolone, methotrexate, and daily 6-mercaptopurine, for 36 weeks; in two cases, the clinical condition remained stable for several years post-treatment. One case showed recurrence 1 year 7 months after treatment, and chemotherapy was re-administered. No case with single-system disease exhibited gastrointestinal involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Although gastrointestinal LCH lesions are rare, they were more common than expected in our cases of multisystem LCH. However, these lesions were relatively small and did not affect the patients' clinical courses.","Matsubara, Yasuo; Kobayashi, Masayuki; Hijikata, Yasuki; Ota, Yasunori; Hirata, Yoshihiro; Lim, Lay Ahyoung; Yotsuyanagi, Hiroshi; Tojo, Arinobu",Int. j. clin. oncol,,585

In this contribution, based on an online survey involving participants from 91 countries, we offer a perspective bridging the two groups, by investigating the role of teachers' demographics and professional adaptation to emergency remote teaching in their perception of how their students were coping with the novel situation. The resultant model explains 51% of variance, and highlights the relative weights of the predictor variables. Given the importance of teacher perceptions in the effectiveness of their instruction, the findings may offer valuable guidelines for future training and intervention programs.","Jelinska, M.; Paradowski, M.

514411,COVID-19: The first documented coronavirus pandemic in history,2020,"This retrospective study compares four different strategies for managing poor ovarian response (POR), namely, conventional stimulation (300 IUs) IVF-fresh embryo transfer (CONVF), mild stimulation (150 IUs) IVF-fresh embryo transfer (MILDF), mild stimulation embryo banking (MILDB), and embryo banking in natural cycles (NATB). In total, 796 POR patients were considered eligible. Statistical analysis revealed a shorter duration of stimulation and a lower required amount of gonadotropins in MILDF compared with CONVF (9.34 ± 1.17 versus 10.37 ± 1.14; 1402 ± 176 versus 3110 ± 343, P < 0.001). Comparing MILDF and MILDB, a higher number of available oocytes and embryos was observed in MILDB (2.36 ± 1.15 versus 6.58 ± 1.11; 1.72 ± 1.02 versus 3.51 ± 0.61, P < 0.001). Moreover, the MILDB presented with a lower number of required oocyte retrievals and a higher number of oocytes per oocyte retrieval compared with NATB (3.90 ± 1.56 versus 7.15 ± 1.80; 1.95 ± 0.74 versus 0.89 ± 0.20, P < 0.001). Data indicate that MILDF is equally efficient and associated with a shorter duration of stimulation and a lower required amount of gonadotropins compared with CONVF. Embryo accumulation may be more efficient compared with a fresh embryo transfer. MILDB may be a more efficient approach compared with NATB. To conclude, embryo accumulation following mild stimulation appears to form the optimal strategy for POR management. More studies are needed to verify these conclusions.","Pantou, Agni; Giannelou, Polina; Grigoriadis, Sokratis; Maziotis, Evangelos; Tzonis, Panagiotis; Koutsouni, Anastasia; Pappa, Charikleia; Philippou, Anastassios; Koutsilieris, Michael; Pantos, Konstantinos; Simopoulou, Mara; Sfakianoudis, Konstantinos",Ann.

This paper reviews the origin, characteristics and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus and the preventive measures adopted by the world's nations to curb the effects of the pandemic. Subjects and methods: The temporal and spatial profile of the COVID-19 spread is highly dynamic and is progressively changing at a rapid pace. This article is an attempt to mitigate the pandemic threat by sharing the review outcome from an extensive literature survey on recent articles on COVID-19 and its impact. Results: Statistical analysis presented by the World Health Organization and other health organizations explicitly indicates that optimized support and care extended to infected persons is the key to therapy, and the clinical effectiveness of alternative techniques is still under study. Though there have been announcements on the discovery of drugs for the virus, the authenticity of these reports are yet to be verified. Conclusion: Based on the review, it can be inferred that it is important to boost one's immune system and to stay healthy by developing healthy habits of food intake, sleep, exercise, personal hygiene and so on. Practicing social distancing with a self-motivated attitude will help to control the virus to a large extent. The current situation also demands a great sense of responsibility of people towards society by protecting oneself from the virus in order to protect the society one lives in.","Jegan, R; Rajalakshmy, P; Subha Hency Jose, P; Nimi, W S",Z Gesundh Wiss,,585

516545,Disruptions during a pandemic: Gaps identified and lessons learned,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes infectious symptoms including fever, cough, respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, and even loss of smell/taste and to date had caused 489 000 people to be infected with 32 000 deaths. This article aims to develop some strategies in dealing with the COVID-19 epidemic to prevent nosocomial infection and ensure the safety of healthcare workforce and employees. METHODS: This is a prospectively registered and retrospective descriptive study investigating the clinical characteristics, results of diagnostic tests, and patients' disposition from February 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020, at a tertiary medical center in Northern Taiwan. RESULTS: There is no nosocomial spreading of SARS-CoV-2 in our facility. The following strategies were followed: information transparency; epidemic prevention resources planning by authorities; multidisciplinary cooperation; informative technologies; immigration quarantine policies; travel restrictions; management of diversion/subdivision; self-health monitoring; social distancing; screening of travel, occupation, contact, and cluster (TOCC) history; traffic control bundling (TCB); training of using personal protective equipment; real-name visiting management; and employee care. The patients' basic characteristics and diagnostic results were gathered. Of the 3832 cases, about 25.9% had travel history. Most of them were traveling to Asia (419 people/time, 10.9%) and from China (256 people/time, 6.7%). Meanwhile, healthcare personnel accounted for 316 people/time (8.3%) and cleaning personnel, 6 people/time (0.16%). The 36 cases who care or have contact with confirmed cases have negative results from the COVID-19 test. The most frequent symptoms were fever and upper respiratory infection followed by gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSION: The above strategies were followed. Patients were stratified based on the risk of TOCC history assessment to ensure the safety of healthcare personnel and patients' appropriate and timely medical services.","Lan, Kai-Ping; Hsu, Yueh-Shuang; Chang, Ching-I; Wei, Pi-Ching; Guo, Ti-Gen; Yen, David Hung-Tsang; Hsu, Teh-Fu; Tzeng, Yuann-Meei; Ming, Jin-Lain",J Chin Med Assoc,,585

The use of personal protective equipment (PPE), necessary to keep safe from COVID-19 increases the chances of overheating, especially during the summer seasons which, due to climate change, are becoming increasingly warm and prolonged. A web survey was carried out in Italy within the WORKLIMATE project during the summer and early autumn 2020. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate differences between groups. 191 questionnaires were collected (hospital doctor 38.2%, nurses 33.5%, other healthcare professionals 28.3%). The impact of PPE on the thermal stress perception declared by the interviewees was very high on the body areas directly covered by these devices (78% of workers). Workers who used masks for more than 4 h per day perceived PPE as more uncomfortable (p &lt; 0.001) compared to the others and reported a greater productivity loss (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the study highlighted a high perception of thermal stress among healthcare workers that worn COVID-19-PPE and this enhances the need for appropriate heat health warning systems and response measures addressed to the occupational sector.","Messeri, A.; Bonafede, M.; Pietrafesa, E.; Pinto, I.; de039,; Donato, F.; Crisci, A.; Lee, J.

The longitudinal change in EAT volume (EATv) and density (EATd), and potential modulators of these parameters, has not been described. We prospectively recruited 90 patients with non-obstructive coronary atherosclerosis on baseline computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) performed for suspected coronary artery disease to undergo a repeat research CTCA. EATv in millilitres (mL) and EATd in Hounsfield units (HU) were analysed and multivariable regression analysis controlling for traditional cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) performed to assess for any predictors of change. Secondary analysis was performed based on statin therapy. The median duration between CTCA was 4.3years. Mean EATv increased at follow-up (72 ± 33 mL to 89 ± 43 mL, p < 0.001) and mean EATd decreased (baseline -76 ± 6 HU vs. -86 ± 5 HU, p < 0.001). There were no associations between baseline variables of body mass index, age, sex, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes or smoking on change in EATv or EATd. No difference in baseline, follow-up or delta EATv or EATd was seen in patients with (60%) or without baseline statin therapy. In this select group of patients, EATv consistently increased and EATd consistently decreased at long-term follow-up and these changes were independent of CVRF, age and statin use. Together with the knowledge of strong associations between EAT and cardiac disease, these findings may suggest that EAT is an independent parameter rather than a surrogate for cardiovascular risk.","Nerlekar, Nitesh; Thakur, Udit; Lin, Andrew; Koh, Ji Quan Samuel; Potter, Elizabeth; Liu, David; Muthalaly, Rahul G; Rashid, Hashrul N; Cameron, James D; Dey, Damini; Wong, Dennis T L",Sci Rep,,585

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this work is to describe the isolation and propagation properties of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the first confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Brazil. METHODS: After diagnosis in patients that returned from Italy to the São Paulo city in late February by RT-PCR, SARS-CoV-2 isolates were obtained in cell cultures and characterised by full genome sequencing, electron microscopy and in vitro replication properties. FINDINGS: The virus isolate was recovered from nasopharyngeal specimen, propagated in Vero cells (E6, CCL-81 and hSLAM), with clear cytopathic effects, and characterised by full genome sequencing, electron microscopy and in vitro replication properties. Virus stocks - viable (titre 2.11 × 106 TCID50/mL, titre 1.5 × 106 PFUs/mL) and inactivated from isolate SARS.CoV2/SP02.2020.HIAE.Br were prepared and set available to the public health authorities and the scientific community in Brazil and abroad. MAIN CONCLUSION: We believe that the protocols for virus growth and studies here described and the distribution initiative may constitute a viable model for other developing countries, not only to help a rapid effective pandemic response, but also to facilitate and support basic scientific research.","Araujo, Danielle Bastos; Machado, Rafael Rahal Guaragna; Amgarten, Deyvid Emanuel; Malta, Fernanda de Mello; de Araujo, Gabriel Guarany; Monteiro, Cairo Oliveira; Candido, Erika Donizetti; Soares, Camila Pereira; de Menezes, Fernando Gatti; Pires, Ana Carolina Cornachioni; Santana, Rúbia Anita Ferraz; Viana, Amanda de Oliveira; Dorlass, Erick; Thomazelli, Luciano; Ferreira, Luis Carlos de Sousa; Botosso, Viviane Fongaro; Carvalho, Cristiane Rodrigues Guzzo; Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal; Pinho, João Renato Rebello; Durigon, Edison Luiz",Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,,585

METHODS: An anonymous web-based survey consisting of 24 questions was sent to all fellowship directors. The survey questions were designed to gain a better understanding of the effects of the current COVID-19 pandemic on the surgical and clinical experience of current, to characterize the types of supplemental educational experiences that fellowship directors had incorporated into the curriculum to compensate for the decreased surgical and clinical workload, and highlight differences based on geographic location. RESULTS: Overall, 22 of 36 fellowship directors responded to our survey, for a total response rate of 61%. The Midwest had the highest response rate at 72.7%, followed by the Northeast (71.4%), the West (50%), and the South (50%). The vast majority of fellowship directors (77.2%) reported the COVID-19 pandemic had a ""significant impact"" on overall pediatric otolaryngology fellowship training. 86.3% of fellowship directors reported that their programs were still performing some surgical operations, but with decreased overall volume. Interestingly, 13.6% of fellowship directors reported that their fellows had been pulled to medicine or ICU services to assist with the COVID-19 pandemic. Of these programs that had a fellow pulled to the ICU or medicine service, 2 out of 3 were located in the Northeast, with the remaining fellow being from a program in the South. CONCLUSION: Overall, pediatric otolaryngology fellowship directors reported the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the overall fellowship experience within the field of pediatric otolaryngology, with the majority feeling that both their fellows surgical and clinical experience have been significantly impacted.","Johnson, Jared; Chung, Michael T; Stathakios, James; Gonik, Nathan; Siegel, Bianca",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,,585

METHODS: Post-hoc analysis of the international, multicentre, ""real-world"" HOPE COVID-19 registry. All patients aged &#8805;65 years hospitalised for COVID-19 were selected. Epidemiological, clinical, analytical and outcome data were obtained. A comparative study between two age subgroups, 65-74 and &#8805;75 years, was performed. The primary endpoint was all cause in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: 1,520 patients aged &#8805;65 years (60.3% male, median age of 76 [IQR 71-83] years) were included. Comorbidities such as hypertension (69.2%), dyslipidemia (48.6%), cardiovascular diseases (any chronic heart disease in 38.4% and cerebrovascular disease in 12.5%), and chronic lung disease (25.3%) were prevalent, and 49.6% were on ACEI/ARBs. Patients aged 75 years and older suffered more in-hospital complications (respiratory failure, heart failure, renal failure, sepsis) and a significantly higher mortality (18.4 vs. 48.2%, P < 0.001), but fewer admissions to intensive care units (11.2 vs. 4.8%).

523517,How Africa Is Promoting Agricultural Innovations and Technologies amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this commentary is to describe the Johns Hopkins Home Care Group's (JHHCG) Community-based Pharmacy Residency Medication Therapy Management (MTM) rotation, summarize adjustments made to the rotation after the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, describe key learnings from the adjustments, and provide a call to action for other residency programs seeking to improve their rotations amidst pandemic restrictions. SUMMARY: MTM clinical pharmacists at JHHCG collaborate with patients to identify barriers to adherence, review medications, and develop plans for improvement. Through improved medication adherence, the goals for this program are to reduce adverse effects, patient cost, and medical visits or hospital admissions. Central to this practice is the belief that strong patient relationships are necessary to uncover the root cause of medication nonadherence. In Postgraduate Year-1 (PGY-1) community-based pharmacy residency training, new pharmacists learn the value of building relationships with patients and working through complex problems during this clinical experience. By assisting patients with complex medical conditions and social situations, new pharmacists gain skills in patient care, pharmacy operations, and medication access challenges. As the COVID-19 pandemic forced the discontinuation of face-to-face interactions in this setting, rotation experiences for residents were adapted with the goal of continuing high-impact patient interactions and keeping everyone involved safe. CONCLUSION: Although considerable changes were made to the MTM rotation because of the COVID-19 pandemic, residents were still able to provide meaningful clinical care telephonically and continued to learn valuable patient care skills. Most importantly, high quality care was still delivered to the patients despite considerable challenges. The major challenge for the residents' clinical experiences as a result of the adjustments has been finding an impactful volume of complex patients to enhance their skills. Other residency programs are encouraged to consider three recommendations to improve their rotations moving forward.","Pennock, Danielle; Barbour, Lauren; Green, Robert; Fu, Denise",,,585

In many patients, it has been found to cause severe hypercoagulability. We present a case of COVID-19 positive patient who developed myocardial infarction (MI) despite being on multiple anticoagulants. A 51-year-old, Middle-Eastern male diabetic patient presented to the emergency room with complaints of sudden onset left leg pain, paresthesias, and swelling for one day. On physical examination, the left leg was cool to touch from forefoot to mid-calf, with noticeable mottling over the forefoot and a nonpalpable dorsalis pedis. The patient was started on therapeutic enoxaparin and diltiazem in ED. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates beginning peripherally and COVID-19 pneumonitis. The patient underwent a mechanical thrombectomy and was loaded with aspirin/clopidogrel, heparin drip, and enoxaparin. Despite being on triple anticoagulation, the patient had new-onset STEMI and elevated troponin levels. On angiography, the patient was found to have occluded mid-left anterior descending, most likely from acute on chronic thrombosis related to the patient’s COVID-19 status. As flow could not be re-established, the patient was kept on long-term protective anticoagulation-triple therapy (an oral anticoagulant and dual antiplatelet therapy) and received pulmonary care for COVID-19 infection. The patient was discharged on long-term triple anticoagulation and COVID-19 precautions with scheduled retesting and follow-up.","Inam, Fatima; Singh, Priyanka R; Khalid, Farhan; Javed, Aqib; Shah, Anuj R",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33824826/,585

To our knowledge, this is the first study in Saudi Arabia to screen blood donors who were not known to be previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional study to assess individuals who donated blood to the central blood bank in Al-Madinah between mid-May and mid-July 2020. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was designed and established to detect antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in serum samples. A total of 1,212 healthy blood donors participated in this study. The donors were males and met the requirements for blood donation during the COVID-19 pandemic period in Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among blood donors in Al-Madinah was 19.31% (n = 234/1212; 95% confidence interval: 17.12%–21.64%). No statistically significant difference was identified in seropositivity according to age. However, significant differences (p < 0.001) were identified according to ABO blood groups, with those with type A blood presenting the highest rate of seropositivity (29.18%) compared with the other blood groups (12.65% for type B, 16.36% for type AB, and 15.11% for type O). CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was detected among blood donors in Al-Madinah, which indicated a high level of exposure to the virus within the population. This further suggested that as high as one-fifth of the population may have acquired innate immunity against the virus.","Mahallawi, Waleed H.; Al-Zalabani, Abdulmohsen H.",Saudi J Biol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519277/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1319562X20306641; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319562X20306641; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.12.009,585

591503,Meteorological Conditions and Covid-19 in Large U.S. Cities,2020-05-22,"BACKGROUND: Headache attacks severely impaired life quality and increase the economic burden of migraineurs. Electroacupuncture (EA) has been used worldwidely to treat several pain-related diseases including migraines. However, whether EA with low or high frequency exerts a distinct analgesic effect remains unknown and needs further study. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a randomised, single-blinded, placebo-controlled trial with three parallel arms. A total of 144 migraine outpatients will be randomly allocated to the 2 Hz EA group, 100 Hz EA group and placebo control group. The duration of the trial is 20 weeks, including a 4-week-long baseline assessment period (weeks − 4–0), a 4-week-long treatment period (weeks 1–4) and a 12-week-long follow-up period (weeks 5–16). Twelve treatment sessions will be performed over a 4-week period (weeks 1–4). The primary outcome will be measured by the frequency of migraine attacks in the past 4 weeks at the end of week 4 post-randomisation. The secondary outcome will be measured by the frequency of migraine attacks in the past 4 weeks at the end of weeks 8, 12 and16 post-randomisation; number of days with migraine; dosage of ibuprofen; the scores of visual analogue scale (VAS); Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS); Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS); and Migraine Specific Quality of Life questionnaire (MSQ) in the past 4 weeks at the end of weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 post-randomisation. Safety assessment, compliance and blinding evaluation will be carried out at the end of week 16 post-randomisation. DISCUSSION: The recruitment will be started on 1 June 2021 and expected to finish on 31 May 2023. We aimed to clarify the dominant frequency of EA on headache attacks in a migraineur.

591776,Return to Work in the Pandemic – Considerations Beyond Infection,2020-11-30,"BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal varices (GOV) are a life-threatening complication in chronic liver disease. A method for non-invasively predicting GOV is crucial for management. This study aimed to determine whether a vein-viewing application can detect abdominal wall varices (AWV) and elucidate the relationship between AWV and GOV. METHODS: One-hundred patients with chronic liver diseases were prospectively enrolled. All the patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy within three months of the enrollment. Unmanipulated images (UI) and vein-weighted images (VWI) were taken for assessing AWV by a vein-viewing application on iPhone. Two doctors independently evaluated both image types. We defined the grading of both UI and AWV as grade 0 (non-detectable), grade 1 (slightly detectable), and grade 2 (distinct). RESULTS: The causes of liver diseases among the 71 men and 29 women (median age, 70.5 yr) included Hepatitis B (n = 19), Hepatitis C (n = 21), alcoholism (n = 33), primary biliary cholangitis (n = 3), autoimmune hepatitis (n = 4) and others (n = 20). GOV was indicated in ﻿60﻿ patients, and half of them had not been treated previously (non-treated). VWI could significantly visualize AWV than UI (72% vs. 24%, p = 0.0005). The presence of cirrhosis (chronic hepatitis vs. cirrhosis = 64.6% vs. 91.4%, p = 0.004) and GOV (52.3% vs. 74.3%, p = 0.032) were significantly higher in the VWI-AWV grade 2 group. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that VWI-AWV grade 2 was an independent factor related to the presence of non-treated GOV [OR = 3.05 (1.24–7.53), p = 0.016]. CONCLUSIONS: The vein-viewing application non-invasively detected AWV related to the presence of cirrhosis and GOV, and VWI-AWV grade 2 was an independent factor related to the presence of non-treated GOV.","Hoshino, Yoshiki; Sugihara, Takaaki; Ikeda, Suguru; Matsuki, Yukako; Nagahara, Takakazu; Okano, Jun-ichi; Isomoto, Hajime",BMC Med Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12880-021-00655-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34372801/,585

592277,Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadian Beekeeping: Survey Results and a Profitability Analysis,2021-09-21,"BACKGROUND: Suboptimal health status (SHS) is a reversible state between ideal health and illness and it can be effectively reversed by risk prediction, disease prevention, and personalized medicine under the global background of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM) concepts. More and more Chinese nurses have been troubled by psychological symptoms (PS). The correlation between PS and SHS is unclear in nurses. The purpose of current study is to investigate the prevalence of SHS and PS in Chinese nurses and the relationship between SHS and PS along with predisposing factors as well as to discuss the feasibility of improving health status and preventing diseases according to PPPM concepts in Chinese nurses. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with the cluster sampling method among 9793 registered nurses in Foshan city, China. SHS was evaluated with the Suboptimal Health Status Questionnaire-25 (SHSQ-25). Meanwhile, the PS of depression and anxiety were evaluated with Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) self-assessment questionnaires. The relationship between PS and SHS in Chinese nurses was subsequently analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 9793 participants, 6107 nurses were included in the final analysis. The prevalence of SHS in the participants was 74.21% (4532/6107) while the symptoms of depression and anxiety were 47.62% (2908/6107) and 24.59% (1502/6107) respectively. The prevalence of SHS in the participants with depression and anxiety was significantly higher than those without the symptoms of depression (83.3% vs 16.7%, P < 0.001) and anxiety (94.2% vs 5.8%, P < 0.0001). The ratio of exercise habit was significantly lower than that of non-exercise habit (68.8% vs 78.4%, P < 0.001) in SHS group. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of SHS and PS in Chinese nurses. PS in Chinese nurses are associated with SHS. Physical exercise is a protective factor for SHS and PS so that the exercise should be strongly recommended as a valuable preventive measure well in the agreement with PPPM philosophy. Along with SDS and SAS, SHSQ-25 should also be highly recommended and applied as a novel predictive/preventive tool for the health measures from the perspectives of PPPM in view of susceptible population and individual screening, the predisposition to chronic disease preventing, personalization of intervention, and the ideal health state restoring.","Zhu, Jinxiu; Ying, Wenjuan; Zhang, Li; Peng, Gangyi; Chen, Weiju; Anto, Enoch Odame; Wang, Xueqing; Lu, Nan; Gao, Shanshan; Wu, Guihai; Yan, Jingyi; Ye, Jianfeng; Wu, Shenglin; Yu, Chengzhi; Yue, Minghui; Huang, Xiru; Xu, Nuo; Ying, Pengxiang; Chen, Yanhong; Tan, Xuerui; Wang, Wei",EPMA J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33078069/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13167-020-00225-y,585

AIM OF THE STUDY: A selective and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry method (HPLC–MS) was developed and validated for simultaneous quantification of cycloastragenol, formononetin, calycosin, 4′-O-β-glucopyranosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol (GMV) and cimifugin in rat plasma after oral administration of Yu Ping Feng San decoction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasma samples were extracted via solid-phase extraction (SPE), separated on a Zorbax SB-C18 column, detected by single quadruple mass spectrometry with an electrospray ionization interface, and quantified using selected ion monitoring mode. The current SPE–HPLC–MS assay was validated for linearity, intra-day and inter-day precisions, accuracy, extraction recovery and stability. The method was applied to a comparative pharmacokinetic study after administration of Yu Ping Feng San to rats at different doses (10, 20 and 40 g/kg). RESULTS: The calibration curves were linear over the ranges 0.50–50 ng/mL and 17.36–1736 ng/mL. Intra- and inter-day precisions (relative standard deviations) were from 0.45% to 10.95%, and accuracy (relative recovery) from 95% to 115%. The extraction recoveries were greater than 88.42% for all analytes. Dose-dependence was shown for some constituents in the drug concentration–time profiles. Among all the active ingredients detected, cimifugin had the highest blood concentration (881–1510 ng/mL), and cycloastragenol had the longest retention time in the rat body (15.06–20.44 h). CONCLUSION: This analytical method is a selective, sensitive, precise, accurate, and reliable assay for simultaneous determination of cycloastragenol, calycosin, formononetin, GMV, and cimifugin in rat plasma.","Li, Tao; Wang, Yiwei; Wang, Yanli; Liang, Rixin; Zhang, Dong; Zhang, Huihui; Chen, Li; Yang, Weipeng",J Ethnopharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2012.12.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23261488/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378874112008446; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874112008446,585
593052,The impact of COVID-19 on the Australian outdoor recreation industry from the perspective of practitioners,2021-09-20,"IMPORTANCE: Solid estimates of the risk of developing symptoms and of progressing to critical disease in individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are key to interpreting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) dynamics, identifying the settings and the segments of the population where transmission is more likely to remain undetected, and defining effective control strategies. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association of age with the likelihood of developing symptoms and the association of age with the likelihood of progressing to critical illness after SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study analyzed quarantined case contacts, identified between February 20 and April 16, 2020, in the Lombardy region of Italy. Contacts were monitored daily for symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, by either real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction using nasopharyngeal swabs or retrospectively via IgG serological assays. Close contacts of individuals with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were selected as those belonging to clusters (ie, groups of contacts associated with an index case) where all individuals were followed up for symptoms and tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data were analyzed from February to June 2020. EXPOSURE: Close contact with individuals with confirmed COVID-19 cases as identified by contact tracing operations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age-specific estimates of the risk of developing respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 °C and of experiencing critical disease (defined as requiring intensive care or resulting in death) in SARS-CoV-2–infected case contacts. RESULTS: In total, 5484 case contacts (median [interquartile range] age, 50 [30-61] years; 3086 female contacts [56.3%]) were analyzed, 2824 of whom (51.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (median [interquartile range] age, 53 [34-64] years; 1604 female contacts [56.8%]). The proportion of infected persons who developed symptoms ranged from 18.1% (95% CI, 13.9%-22.9%) among participants younger than 20 years to 64.6% (95% CI, 56.6%-72.0%) for those aged 80 years or older. Most infected contacts (1948 of 2824 individuals [69.0%]) did not develop respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 °C. Only 26.1% (95% CI, 24.1%-28.2%) of infected individuals younger than 60 years developed respiratory symptoms or fever greater than or equal to 37.5 °C; among infected participants older than 60 years, 6.6% (95% CI, 5.1%-8.3%) developed critical disease. Female patients were 52.7% (95% CI, 24.4%-70.7%) less likely than male patients to develop critical disease after SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this Italian cohort study of close contacts of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, more than one-half of individuals tested positive for the virus. However, most infected individuals did not develop respiratory symptoms or fever. The low proportion of children and young adults who developed symptoms highlights the possible challenges in readily identifying SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Poletti, Piero; Tirani, Marcello; Cereda, Danilo; Trentini, Filippo; Guzzetta, Giorgio; Sabatino, Giuliana; Marziano, Valentina; Castrofino, Ambra; Grosso, Francesca; Del Castillo, Gabriele; Piccarreta, Raffaella; Andreassi, Aida; Melegaro, Alessia; Gramegna, Maria; Ajelli, Marco; Merler, Stefano",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33688964/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.1085,585

The aim of the study is to describe the organizational model and clinical outcomes of patients confirmed COVID-19 needing renal replacement therapy, admitted in a COVID Hospital in Southern Italy during the first and second pandemic wave. METHOD: All the consecutive patients requiring chronic HD, during the first and second wave were considered. Due to local resources, we have implemented an organizational model based on the HD bedside with Genius system. The machine was prepared in the Dialysis Unit and then transferred to the COVID Hospital. After treatment, the monitor was sterilized and carefully cleaned with chlorine wipes and re-transferred into the dialysis Unit to be prepared for the next dialysis. Demographic data, clinical symptoms at presentation, and laboratory results were extracted by the electronic medical record. Patients hospitalized during the first wave (FW) and second wave (SW) were compared. RESULTS: From March 10 through December 31 2020, we enrolled a cohort of 40 patients (37.5% F), with COVID-19 infection requiring HD; 11 (27.5%) during first and 29 (72.5%) during second wave. The phenotype and clinical symptoms at the admission were not different between two groups. Compared to FW, the SW patients were younger (70.1±9.5 vs 77.3±5.9 years; p<0.03) with lower dialysis vintage (35±18 vs 60±48 months; p<0.05), and lower Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (2.8 ± 1.8 vs 5.09 ± 2.0; p<0.05). No differences were observed between the first and second wave as far as inflammatory markers IL6 (51.9 ± 44.8 vs 55.45 ± 40.52 pg/mL; ns) and C-reactive protein (4.74 ± 3.8 vs 6.70 ± 5.44 mg/L; ns) as well as the hospital stay (21.1±10 vs 24.4.8±10 days; ns) and in-hospital mortality (28.1% vs 18.2%; ns). Overall, 354 bedside treatments were performed; mean session time and mean weekly sessions were 3.64 ± 0.40 hours, and 3.4 ± 0.45 HD/week, with no differences between FW and SW patients. CONCLUSION: Our data show that the higher spread of Sars-cov2 during the second wave has infected younger and less comorbid HD patients, with no significant differences in clinical and laboratory parameters.

594187,Did the COVID-19 pandemic help or hurt Donald Trump’s political fortunes?,2021-02-24,"INTRODUCTION: There is an urgent need to develop effective interventional treatments for people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD results from a complex multi‐decade interplay of multiple interacting dysfunctional biological systems that have not yet been fully elucidated. Epidemiological studies have linked several modifiable lifestyle factors with increased incidence for AD. Because monotherapies have failed to prevent or ameliorate AD, interventional studies should deploy multiple, targeted interventions that address the dysfunctional systems that give rise to AD. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will examine the efficacy of a 12‐month personalized, multimodal, lifestyle intervention in 60 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early stage AD patients (aged 50+, amyloid positivity). Both groups receive data‐driven, lifestyle recommendations designed to target multiple systemic pathways implicated in AD. One group receives these personalized recommendations without coaching. The other group receives personalized recommendations with health coaching, dietary counseling, exercise training, cognitive stimulation, and nutritional supplements. We collect clinical, proteomic, metabolomic, neuroimaging, and genetic data to fuel systems‐biology analyses. We will examine effects on cognition and hippocampal volume. The overarching goal of the study is to longitudinally track biological systems implicated in AD to reveal the dynamics between these systems during the intervention to understand differences in treatment response. RESULTS: We have developed and implemented a protocol for a personalized, multimodal intervention program for early AD patients. We began enrollment in September 2019; we have enrolled a third of our target (20 of 60) with a 95% retention and 86% compliance rate. DISCUSSION: This study presents a paradigm shift in designing multimodal, lifestyle interventions to reduce cognitive decline, and how to elucidate the biological systems being targeted. Analytical efforts to explain mechanistic or causal underpinnings of individual trajectories and the interplay between multi‐omic variables will inform the design of future hypotheses and development of effective precision medicine trials.","McEwen, Sarah C.; Merrill, David A.; Bramen, Jennifer; Porter, Verna; Panos, Stella; Kaiser, Scott; Hodes, John; Ganapathi, Aarthi; Bell, Lesley; Bookheimer, Tess; Glatt, Ryan; Rapozo, Molly; Ross, Mary Kay; Price, Nathan D.; Kelly, Daniel; Funk, Cory C.; Hood, Leroy; Roach, Jared C.",Alzheimers Dement (N Y),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34295960/; https://doi.org/10.1002/trc2.12191,585

Risk factors include pneumonia, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, high airway pressures and concomitant pulmonary disease. Current evidence suggests that ARDS-related ACP is amenable to multimodal treatments including ventilator adjustment (aiming for arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide < 60 mmHg, plateau pressure < 27 cmH(2)O, driving pressure < 17 cmH(2)O), prone positioning, fluid balance optimization and pharmacotherapy.

To mitigate viral escape, we developed a cocktail of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) targeting epitopes located on different domains of spike (S) protein. Screening of a library of monoclonal antibodies generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of COVID-19 convalescent patients yielded potent NAbs, targeting N-terminal domain (NTD) and RBD domain of S, effective at nM concentrations. Remarkably, combination of RBD-targeting NAbs and NTD-binding NAb, FC05, enhanced the neutralization potency in cell-based assays and animal model. Results of competitive SPR assays and cryo-EM structures of Fabs bound to S unveil determinants of immunogenicity. Combinations of immunogens, identified in NTD and RBD of S, when immunized in rabbits and macaques elicited potent protective immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, two immunizations of this combination of NTD and RBD immunogens provided complete protection in macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, without observable antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. These results provide a proof-of-concept for neutralization-based immunogen design targeting SARS-CoV-2 NTD and RBD.","Zhang, Li; Cao, Lei; Gao, Xing-Su; Zheng, Bin-Yang; Deng, Yong-Qiang; Li, Jing-Xin; Feng, Rui; Bian, Qian; Guo, Xi-Ling; Wang, Nan; Qiu, Hong-Ying; Wang, Lei; Cui, Zhen; Ye, Qing; Chen, Geng; Lu, Kui-Kui; Chen, Yin; Chen, Yu-Tao; Pan, Hong-Xing; Yu, Jiaping; Yao, Wenrong; Zhu, Bao-Li; Chen, Jianping; Liu, Yong; Qin, Cheng-Feng; Wang, Xiangxi; Zhu, Feng-Cai",Natl Sci Rev,https://doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwab053,585

Many of these drugs suffer from polymorphic transformations with changes in the drug’s safety and efficacy; many are poorly soluble, poorly bioavailable drugs. Current tools to reformulate antiviral APIs into safer and more bioavailable forms include pharmaceutical salts and cocrystals, even though it is difficult to classify solid forms into these regulatory-wise mutually exclusive categories. Pure liquid salt forms of APIs, ionic liquids that incorporate APIs into their structures (API-ILs) present all the advantages that salt forms provide from a pharmaceutical standpoint, without being subject to solid-state matter problems. In this perspective article, the myths and the most voiced concerns holding back implementation of API-ILs are examined, and two case studies of API-ILs antivirals (the amphoteric acyclovir and GSK2838232) are presented in detail, with a focus on drug property improvement.

598991,Impact of Covid-19 on field and office workforce in construction industry,2021-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Mental health disorders are viewed as a global concern requiring globally led approaches to address them. Since the publication of the 2007 Lancet series on global mental health (GMH), the term has become widespread. Over the last two decades, GMH has become increasingly affiliated with policy reform, academic courses, funding bodies and research. However, it is not always obvious how those working in the field of GMH are using the term, resulting in a lack of clarity. Therefore, work is needed to synthesise the current understanding(s) of GMH to help characterise its meaning. AIM: To synthesise the literature and identify the different ways GMH is understood. METHOD: A conceptual review, using a systematic search and a content analysis, was conducted to develop a conceptual framework of the different conceptual understandings of GMH. RESULTS: We developed a conceptual framework of four understandings of GMH. These understandings of GMH are as follows: an area of research generating findings to establish a GMH evidence-base; implementation of research into practice; improving the mental health environment; learning from and supporting low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). CONCLUSION: Our review proposes a simple framework, clarifying the key characteristics of the GMH landscape. The findings highlight the diversity of usage of the term in the literature, as well as present the wide scope that comprises the field of GMH. Referring to this framework may help those engaged with GMH to be more specific with which aspect of the field they are concerned with.","Rajabzadeh, Vian; Burn, Erin; Sajun, Sana Z.; Suzuki, Mimi; Bird, Victoria Jane; Priebe, Stefan",BMJ Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758013/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004631,585

602726,Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Are There Any Concerns?,2020-08-11,"Dental fear and anxiety is a significant issue that affects pediatric patients and creates challenges in oral health management. Considering that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, along with its associated sanitary regime, social distancing measures and nationwide quarantines, could itself induce public fears, including in children, it is of great interest to explore whether this situation and the necessity of reorganizing dental care could potentially affect the emotional state of pediatric patients facing a need for urgent dental intervention. The present study assessed the emotional state of children ≤ seven years old (n = 25) requiring dental healthcare during a nationwide quarantine in Poland, as well as the anxiety levels of their caregivers. The Faces Anxiety Scale was adopted, and the evaluation was independently performed by the dentist, caregivers and children themselves. The level of anxiety in caregivers was also measured. As demonstrated, children requiring dental intervention during the nationwide quarantine did not reveal a significantly higher anxiety level as compared to the age- and indication-matched pre-pandemic control group (n = 20), regardless of whether their emotional state was evaluated by the dentist, caregivers, or by themselves. However, the share of children scoring the lowest anxiety level in all assessments was smaller in the pandemic group. Boys in the pandemic group had a higher anxiety level, as indicated by a caregiver assessment, and displayed a negative correlation with age in all three types of evaluation. Moreover, caregiver anxiety levels were higher in the pandemic group as compared to the pre-pandemic subset and revealed stronger correlations with the dental anxiety in children. The results suggest that the reorganization of oral healthcare under the pandemic scenario did not have a profound effect on children’s dental anxiety. Nevertheless, findings in young boys highlight that they may be more vulnerable and require special care to mitigate their anxiety and decrease the risk of dentophobia in the future—these observations must be, however, treated with caution due to the small sample size and require further confirmation. Moreover, it is important to reassure caregivers of the safety of the dental visit during the pandemic to minimize the effect of their own anxiety on dental fears in children.","Olszewska, Aneta; Rzymski, Piotr",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9092751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854401/,585

Evidence suggests that severe outcomes in COVID19 infection are attributed to the excessive activation of the complement cascade leading to acute lung injury and associated is with an increased prothrombotic state. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 27-year-old Caucasian man with PNH presented to the Emergency Department of our hospital with acute onset shortness of breath, cough and blood in urine. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with acute hemolytic exacerbation of PNH complicated with moderate COVID19 pneumonia. OUTCOMES: The patient was initiated with an anticoagulant unfractionated heparin, dexamethasone, and cefuroxime injection. His symptoms quickly resolved, and he was discharged after 5 days. CONCLUSION: The complement system activation is a critical component in the sequalae of COVID19 infection. Evidence suggests that severe outcomes in COVID19 infection are attributed to the excessive activation of the complement cascade leading to acute lung injury and associated is with an increased prothrombotic state. Notably, C5a concentration was noted to be higher in patients with COVID19 infection. The use of complement inhibitors to attenuate immune mediated damage in COVID19 nevertheless represents a very interesting theoretical approach. However, careful consideration as to which patients may benefit will be required and the outcome of clinical trials needed.","Sokol, Juraj; Nehaj, Frantisek; Mokan, Michal; Lisa, Lenka; Stasko, Jan",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000025456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34011023/,585

Study design Retrospective observational study. Methods Data for all patients admitted to seven community hospitals in Michigan, United States with polymerase chain reaction confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 from March 10 to April 15, 2020 was analyzed. The primary outcomes of racial disparity in inpatient mortality and intubation were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate regression models. Results The study included 336 black and 408 white patients. Black patients were younger (62.9 +/- 15.0 years vs 71.8 +/- 16.4, P<.001), had a higher mean body mass index (32.4 +/- 8.6 vs 28.8 +/- 7.5, P<.001), had higher prevalence of diabetes (136/336 vs 130/408, P=.02) and presented later (6.6 +/-5.3 days after symptom onset vs. 5.4 +/- 5.4, P=.006) compared to white patients. Younger black patients had a higher prevalence of obesity (age< 65, 69.9%) than older black patients (age>65, 39.2%) and younger white patients (age<65, 55.1%). Intubation did not reach statistical significance for racial difference (black patients 61/335 vs. 54/406, P=.08). Mortality was not higher in black patients (65/335 vs. 142/406 in white patients, Odds ratio 0.61, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.99, 2 sided P=.05) in multivariate analysis, accounting for other risk factors associated with mortality. Conclusions Higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes in young black populations may be the critical factor driving disproportionate COVID-19 hospitalizations in black populations. Hospitalized black patients do not have worse outcomes compared to white patients.","Krishnamoorthy, Geetha; Arsene, Camelia; Jena, Nihar; Mogulla, Swathi Muthyam; Coakley, Robert; Khine, Justin; Khosrodad, Nadia; Klein, Alysson; Sule, Anupam Ashutosh",Public Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350620305096; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.11.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385640/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350620305096?v=s5,585

Surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein are two important proteins of this virus facilitating its entry into host cell and genome replication. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a prospective tool of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway for the control of human viral infections by suppressing viral gene expression through hybridization and neutralization of target complementary mRNA. So, in this study, the power of RNA interference technology was harnessed to develop siRNA molecules against specific target genes namely, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene and surface glycoprotein gene. Conserved sequence from 139 SARS-CoV-2 strains from around the globe was collected to construct 78 siRNA that can inactivate nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein genes. Finally, based on GC content, free energy of folding, free energy of binding, melting temperature and efficacy prediction process 8 siRNA molecules were selected which are proposed to exerts the best action.

It focused on the shortages of health goods and the experiences of hospitals during the first phase of the crisis. METHODS: A 17-question survey was conducted by EAHP, looking at the experiences of hospital pharmacists during the COVD-19 pandemic. The survey ran from 16 September to 23 December 2020. Statistical analysis included backward stepwise logistic regression (BSLR), Pearson’s χ(2) test, t-test and one-way ANOVA, as appropriate; p≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: 1466 hospital pharmacists answered the survey fully. 58%, 63% and 69% of them experienced shortages in medicines, disinfectants and personal protective equipment (PPE), respectively. BSLR showed that being a COVID-19 dedicated hospital increased the risk of medicine shortages (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.31) but the shortages of disinfectants and PPE were lower (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.88; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.85). Being a specialised hospital reduced the odds of medicine shortages (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.88), while countries with a greater percentage of the population infected had increased odds for all three types of shortages (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.23; OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.50; OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.35). The odds were also higher in answers submitted in September compared with December. The classes of medicines with highest reported shortages were anaesthetics, antibiotics and muscle relaxants. The main entities that provided support were the national competent authorities and manufacturers. CONCLUSION: Medicine shortages affected the work of hospital pharmacists during the early stages of the pandemic. The features of the crisis and the feedback described in this survey can provide interesting insights for a more resilient healthcare framework in the future.","Leonardi Vinci, Daniele; Polidori, Piera; Miljković, Nenad; Batista, Aida; Amann, Steffen; Makridaki, Despina; Kohl, Stephanie",Eur J Hosp Pharm,https://doi.org/10.1136/ejhpharm-2021-002944; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34497129/,585

They are a small, genetically modifiable animal forwhich a large arsenal of genetic and immunologic tools is available for evaluation of pathogenesis and potential vaccines and therapeutics. SARS-CoV-2, the betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, does not naturally replicate in wild-type mice, due to structural differences between human and mouse ACE2, the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. However, several mouse strains have been developed that allow for SARS-CoV-2 replication and clinical disease. Two broad strategies have primarily been deployed for developing mouse strains susceptible to COVID-19-like disease: adding in the human ACE2 gene and adapting the virus to the mouse ACE2 receptor. Both approaches result in mice that develop several of the clinical and pathologic hallmarks of COVID-19, including acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury. In this review, we describe key acute pulmonary and extrapulmonary pathologic changes seen in COVID-19 patients that mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection ideally replicate, the essential development of mouse models for the study of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and the basis of many of the models of COVID-19, and key clinical and pathologic features of currently available mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Knight, Audrey C; Montgomery, Stephanie A; Fletcher, Craig A; Baxter, Victoria K",Comp. med,https://doi.org/10.30802/aalas-cm-21-000031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34610856/,585
606096,In education we trust: on handling the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Swedish welfare state,2021-03-03,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nonstructural protein 13 (SCV nsP13), a superfamily 1 helicase, plays a central role in viral RNA replication through the unwinding of duplex RNA and DNA with a 5′ single-stranded tail in a 5′ to 3′ direction. Despite its putative role in viral RNA replication, nsP13 readily unwinds duplex DNA by cooperative translocation. Herein, nsP13 exhibited different characteristics in duplex RNA unwinding than that in duplex DNA. nsP13 showed very poor processivity on duplex RNA compared with that on duplex DNA. More importantly, nsP13 inefficiently unwinds duplex RNA by increasing the 5′-ss tail length. As the concentration of nsP13 increased, the amount of unwound duplex DNA increased and that of unwound duplex RNA decreased. The accumulation of duplex RNA/nsP13 complexes increased as the concentration of nsP13 increased. An increased ATP concentration in the unwinding of duplex RNA relieved the decrease in duplex RNA unwinding. Thus, nsP13 has a strong affinity for duplex RNA as a substrate for the unwinding reaction, which requires increased ATPs to processively unwind duplex RNA. Our results suggest that duplex RNA is a preferred substrate for the helicase activity of nsP13 than duplex DNA at high ATP concentrations.","Jang, Kyoung-Jin; Jeong, Seonghwan; Kang, Dong Young; Sp, Nipin; Yang, Young Mok; Kim, Dong-Eun",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32161317/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61432-1,585

When this probability crosses 0.95 an outbreak can be declared over with 95% confidence. Our method is easy to compute, only requires knowledge of the incidence curve and the serial interval distribution, and evaluates the statistical lifetime of the outbreak of interest. Using this approach, we show how the time-varying under-reporting of infected cases will artificially inflate the inferred probability of elimination, leading to premature (false-positive) end-of-epidemic declarations. Contrastingly, we prove that incorrectly identifying imported cases as local will deceptively decrease this probability, resulting in delayed (false-negative) declarations. Failing to sustain intensive surveillance during the later phases of an epidemic can therefore substantially mislead policymakers on when it is safe to remove travel bans or relax quarantine and social distancing advisories. World Health Organisation guidelines recommend fixed (though disease-specific) waiting times for end-of-epidemic declarations that cannot accommodate these variations. Consequently, there is an unequivocal need for more active and specialised metrics for reliably identifying the conclusion of an epidemic.","Parag, Kris V.; Donnelly, Christl A.; Jha, Rahul; Thompson, Robin N.",PLoS Comput Biol,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008478; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33253158/,585

We performed a large-scale survey to investigate vaccine-associated adverse events (VAAEs), including anaphylaxis, in Japan by distributing questionnaires on VAAEs to veterinary hospitals from April 1, 2006 through May 31, 2007. Valid responses were obtained for 57,300 vaccinated dogs at 573 animal hospitals; we obtained VAAEs information for last 100 vaccinated dogs in each veterinary hospital. We found that of the 57,300, 359 dogs showed VAAEs. Of the 359 dogs, death was observed in 1, anaphylaxis in 41, dermatological signs in 244, gastrointestinal signs in 160, and other signs in 106. Onset of VAAEs was mostly observed within 12 h after vaccination (n = 299, 83.3%). In this study, anaphylaxis events occurred within 60 min after vaccination, and about half of these events occurred within 5 min (n = 19, 46.3%). Furthermore, where anaphylaxis was reported, additional information to support the diagnosis was obtained by reinvestigation. Our resurvey of dogs with anaphylaxis yielded responses on 31 dogs; 27 of these demonstrated collapse (87.1%), 24 demonstrated cyanosis (77.4%), and both signs occurred in 22 (71.0%). Higher rates of animal VAAEs, anaphylaxis, and death were found in Japan than in other countries. Further investigations, including survey studies, will be necessary to elucidate the interaction between death and vaccination and the risk factors for VAAEs, and thus develop safer vaccines. Moreover, it may also be necessary to continually update the data of VAAEs.","Miyaji, Kazuki; Suzuki, Aki; Shimakura, Hidekatsu; Takase, Yukari; Kiuchi, Akio; Fujimura, Masato; Kurita, Goro; Tsujimoto, Hajime; Sakaguchi, Masahiro",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242712000037; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242712000037; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.12.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22264736/,585

METHODS: An electronic search of PubMed, Embase, Medline, MedRxiv, CNKI, and the Chinese Medical Journal Full Text Database following PRISMA guidelines was performed through April 18, 2020. Search terms included COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, pregnant women, infants, and vertical transmission. RESULTS: A total of 230 women with COVID-19 (154 deliveries, 66 ongoing pregnancies, and 10 abortions) and 156 newborns from 20 eligible studies were included in this systematic review. A total of 34.62% of the pregnant patients had obstetric complications, and 59.05% of patients displayed fever. Lymphopenia was observed in 40.71% of patients. A total of 5.19% of women received mechanical ventilation. Seven women were critically ill. One mother and two newborns died. A total of 24.74% of newborns were premature. Five newborns’ throat swab tests of SARS-CoV-2 were positive, all of which were delivered by cesarean section. For eight newborns with negative throat swab tests, three had both elevated IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Nucleic acid tests of vaginal secretions, breast milk, amniotic fluid, placental blood, and placental tissues were negative. CONCLUSION: Most pregnant patients were mildly ill.

The ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic has interrupted the healthcare system and end‐of‐life care tremendously. This review aimed to explore available articles on advance care planning amid the pandemic and analyze qualitatively. PubMed and Google Scholar were searched on February 2021 using the relevant keywords. Retrieved articles were screened applying inclusion criteria. Any article describing advance care planning during the COVID‐19 era was included. A qualitative content analysis was conducted. In total, 20 articles incorporating 5542 participants from five countries were included. Among the articles, eight were primary studies and the rest were perspective papers or secondary analysis. From the qualitative content analysis six major themes emerged namely palliative care, lack of coordination among acute care, hospital palliative care, and long‐term care, community‐based advance care planning, real‐time dissemination of scientific information on the regional pandemic situation, online system and legislation. The COVID‐19 pandemic had decreased the uptake of advance care planning. Findings of the review suggested simplification of the procedure regarding advance care planning, implementation of community‐based advance care planning and utilization of online resources to enhance the process.

608188,Chapter 25 COVID-19 pandemic: Case studies and perspectives,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented challenges to health systems worldwide, including the control of non-COVID-19 diseases. Malaria cases and deaths may increase due to the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic in malaria-endemic countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This scoping review aims to summarize information on public health-relevant effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the malaria situation in SSA. METHODS: Review of publications and manuscripts on preprint servers, in peer-reviewed journals and in grey literature documents from 1 December, 2019 to 9 June, 2021. A structured search was conducted on different databases using predefined eligibility criteria for the selection of articles. RESULTS: A total of 51 papers have been included in the analysis. Modelling papers have predicted a significant increase in malaria cases and malaria deaths in SSA due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many papers provided potential explanations for expected COVID-19 effects on the malaria burden; these ranged from relevant diagnostical and clinical aspects to reduced access to health care services, impaired availability of curative and preventive commodities and medications, and effects on malaria prevention campaigns. Compared to previous years, fewer country reports provided data on the actual number of malaria cases and deaths in 2020, with mixed results. While highly endemic countries reported evidence of decreased malaria cases in health facilities, low endemic countries reported overall higher numbers of malaria cases and deaths in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this review provide evidence for a significant but diverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria in SSA. There is the need to further investigate the public health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the malaria burden.

608543,Canadian College of Medical Geneticists (CCMG) points to consider: resuming genetic services in a pandemic—a summary,2020-11-16,"BACKGROUND: Adults increasingly live and die with chronic progressive conditions into advanced age. Many live with multimorbidity and an uncertain illness trajectory with points of marked decline, loss of function and increased risk of end of life. Intermediate care units support mainly older adults in transition between hospital and home to regain function and anticipate and plan for end of life. This study examined the patient characteristics and the factors associated with mortality over 1 year post-admission to an intermediate care unit to inform priorities for care. METHODS: A national cohort study of adults admitted to intermediate care units in England using linked individual-level Hospital Episode Statistics and death registration data. The main outcome was mortality within 1 year from admission. The cohort was examined as two groups with significant differences in mortality between main diagnosis of a non-cancer condition and cancer. Data analysis used Kaplan-Meier curves to explore mortality differences between the groups and a time-dependant Cox proportional hazards model to determine mortality risk factors. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 76,704 adults with median age 81 years (IQR 70–88) admitted to 220 intermediate care units over 1 year in 2016. Overall, 28.0% died within 1 year post-admission. Mortality varied by the main diagnosis of cancer (total n = 3680, 70.8% died) and non-cancer condition (total n = 73,024, 25.8% died). Illness-related factors had the highest adjusted hazard ratios [aHRs]. At 0–28 days post-admission, risks were highest for non-cancer respiratory conditions (pneumonia (aHR 6.17 [95%CI 4.90–7.76]), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aHR 5.01 [95% CI 3.78–6.62]), dementia (aHR 5.07 [95% CI 3.80–6.77]) and liver disease (aHR 9.75 [95% CI 6.50–14.6]) compared with musculoskeletal disorders. In cancer, lung cancer showed largest risk (aHR 1.20 [95%CI 1.04–1.39]) compared with cancer ‘other’. Risks increased with high multimorbidity for non-cancer (aHR 2.57 [95% CI 2.36–2.79]) and cancer (aHR 2.59 [95% CI 2.13–3.15]) (reference: lowest). CONCLUSIONS: One in four patients died within 1 year. Indicators for palliative care assessment are respiratory conditions, dementia, liver disease, cancer and rising multimorbidity. The traditional emphasis on rehabilitation and recovery in intermediate care units has changed with an ageing population and the need for greater integration of palliative care.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is necessary to adequately evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of the asthma population in the COVID-19 tested and diagnosed population. OBJECTIVE: We performed a study to assess the impact of asthma on COVID-19 diagnosis, presenting symptoms, disease severity, and cytokine profiles. METHODS: This was an analysis of a prospectively collected cohort of patients suspected of having COVID-19 who presented for COVID-19 testing at a tertiary medical center in Missouri, USA between March and September 2020. We classified and analyzed patients according to their preexisting asthma diagnosis and subsequent COVID-19 testing results. RESULTS: COVID-19 suspected patients (n=435) were enrolled in this study. The proportion of patients testing positive for COVID-19 was 69.2% and 81.9% in the asthma and non-asthma groups respectively. The frequency of relevant symptoms are similar between asthma groups with positive and negative COVID-19 test results. In the COVID-19 diagnosed population (n=343), asthma was not associated with several indicators of COVID-19 severity, including hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, death due to COVID-19, and in-hospital mortality after multivariate adjustment. COVID-19 patients with asthma exhibited significantly lower levels of plasma interleukin (IL)-8 compared to patients without asthma (adjusted p=0.023). CONCLUSION: The asthma population is facing a challenge in preliminary COVID-19 evaluation due to overlap in symptoms of COVID-19 and asthma. However, asthma does not increase the risk of COVID-19 severity if infected.","Cao, Lijuan; Lee, Sandra; Krings, James G.; Rauseo, Adriana M.; Reynolds, Daniel; Presti, Rachel; Goss, Charles; Mudd, Philip A.; O'Halloran, Jane A.; Wang, Leyao",Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33639262/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1081120621001381?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2021.02.020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1081120621001381,585

610321,Responding to COVID-19: The UW Medicine Information Technology Services Experience,2020-04-08,"Preclinical mouse models that recapitulate some characteristics of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will facilitate focused study of pathogenesis and virus–host responses. Human agniotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) serves as an entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to infect people via binding to envelope spike proteins. Herein we report development and characterization of a rapidly deployable COVID-19 mouse model. C57BL/6J (B6) mice expressing hACE2 in the lung were transduced by oropharyngeal delivery of the recombinant human adenovirus type 5 that expresses hACE2 (Ad5-hACE2). Mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at Day 4 after transduction and developed interstitial pneumonia associated with perivascular inflammation, accompanied by significantly higher viral load in lungs at Days 3, 6, and 12 after infection compared with Ad5-empty control group. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in pneumocytes in alveolar septa. Transcriptomic analysis of lungs demonstrated that the infected Ad5-hACE mice had a significant increase in IFN-dependent chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl10, and genes associated with effector T-cell populations including Cd3 g, Cd8a, and Gzmb. Pathway analysis showed that several Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were enriched in the data set, including cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, the chemokine signaling pathway, the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, the measles pathway, and the IL-17 signaling pathway. This response is correlative to clinical response in lungs of patients with COVID-19. These results demonstrate that expression of hACE2 via adenovirus delivery system sensitized the mouse to SARS-CoV-2 infection and resulted in the development of a mild COVID-19 phenotype, highlighting the immune and inflammatory host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This rapidly deployable COVID-19 mouse model is useful for preclinical and pathogenesis studies of COVID-19.","Han, Kun; Blair, Robert V.; Iwanaga, Naoki; Liu, Fengming; Russell-Lodrigue, Kasi E.; Qin, Zhongnan; Midkiff, Cecily C.; Golden, Nadia A.; Doyle-Meyers, Lara A.; Kabir, Mohammad E.; Chandler, Kristin E.; Cutrera, Kellie L.; Ren, Mi; Monjure, Christopher J.; Lehmicke, Gabrielle; Fischer, Tracy; Beddingfield, Brandon; Wanek, Alanna G.; Birnbaum, Angela; Maness, Nicholas J.; Roy, Chad J.; Datta, Prasun K.; Rappaport, Jay; Kolls, Jay K.; Qin, Xuebin",Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,https://doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2020-0354oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991819/,585

Herein, as an alternative for PCB, we described a non-printed integrated-circuit textile (NIT) for biomedical and theranostic application via a weaving method. All the devices are built as fibers or interlaced nodes and woven into a deformable textile integrated circuit. Built on an electrochemical gating principle, the fiber-woven-type transistors exhibit superior bending or stretching robustness, and were woven as a textile logical computing module to distinguish different emergencies. A fiber-type sweat sensor was woven with strain and light sensors fibers for simultaneously monitoring body health and the environment. With a photo-rechargeable energy textile based on a detailed power consumption analysis, the woven circuit textile is completely self-powered and capable of both wireless biomedical monitoring and early warning.

In this study, we examined whether natto impairs infection by viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as well as bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1). Interestingly, our results show that both SARS-CoV-2 and BHV-1 treated with a natto extract were fully inhibited infection to the cells. We also found that the glycoprotein D of BHV-1 was shown to be degraded by Western blot analysis and that a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) was proteolytically degraded when incubated with the natto extract. In addition, RBD protein carrying a point mutation (UK variant N501Y) was also degraded by the natto extract. When the natto extract was heated at 100 °C for 10 min, the ability of both SARS-CoV-2 and BHV-1 to infect to the cells was restored. Consistent with the results of the heat inactivation, a serine protease inhibitor inhibited anti-BHV-1 activity caused by the natto extract. Thus, our findings provide the first evidence that the natto extract contains a protease(s) that inhibits viral infection through the proteolysis of the viral proteins.","Oba, Mami; Rongduo, Wen; Saito, Akatsuki; Okabayashi, Tamaki; Yokota, Tomoko; Yasuoka, Junko; Sato, Yoko; Nishifuji, Koji; Wake, Hitoshi; Nibu, Yutaka; Mizutani, Tetsuya",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34271432/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X21010718; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X21010718; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.07.034,585

In 2019, the whole world has had to come together to confront a life-threatening nanomachine named ""SARS-CoV-2"", which causes COVID-19 illness. SARS-CoV-2, a smart nanomachine, attaches itself onto the ACE2 and CD147 receptors present on the cell surfaces of the lungs, kidneys, heart, brain, intestines, and testes, etc. and triggers pathogenesis. Cell entry triggers a cascade of inflammatory responses resulting in tissue damage, with the worst affected cases leading to death.

615038,"Forecasting hospitalizations due to COVID-19 in South Dakota, USA.",2020-07-24,"In the nineteenth century, it was recognised that acute attacks of chronic bronchitis were harmful. 140 years later, it is clearer than ever that exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ECOPD) are important events. They are associated with significant mortality, morbidity, a reduced quality of life and an increasing reliance on social care. ECOPD are common and are increasing in prevalence. Exacerbations beget exacerbations, with up to a quarter of in-patient episodes ending with readmission to hospital within 30 days. The healthcare costs are immense. Yet despite this, the tools available to diagnose and treat ECOPD are essentially unchanged, with the last new intervention (non-invasive ventilation) introduced over 25 years ago. An ECOPD is ‘an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy’. This symptom and healthcare utility-based definition does not describe pathology and is unable to differentiate from other causes of an acute deterioration in breathlessness with or without a cough and sputum. There is limited understanding of the host immune response during an acute event and no reliable and readily available means to identify aetiology or direct treatment at the point of care (POC). Corticosteroids, short acting bronchodilators with or without antibiotics have been the mainstay of treatment for over 30 years. This is in stark contrast to many other acute presentations of chronic illness, where specific biomarkers and mechanistic understanding has revolutionised care pathways. So why has progress been so slow in ECOPD? This review examines the history of diagnosing and treating ECOPD. It suggests that to move forward, there needs to be an acceptance that not all exacerbations are alike (just as not all COPD is alike) and that clinical presentation alone cannot identify aetiology or stratify treatment.","Sapey, Elizabeth; Bafadhel, Mona; Bolton, Charlotte Emma; Wilkinson, Thomas; Hurst, John R; Quint, Jennifer K",Thorax,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31273049/; https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2018-213035,585

Design Retrospective observational cohort study. Setting National designated center for patients with COVID-19. Participants 51 consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Interventions Patients were referred for physical therapy after transferring out from ICU if they had functional impairments. Main Outcome Measures Functional outcomes were measured primarily with the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), and divided into 2 categories: dependent ambulators (FAC 0-3) and independent ambulators (FAC 4-5). Secondary outcomes measured included ADL dependence of patients and the need for supplemental oxygen. Results All patients were premorbidly independent in walking and in basic ADLs, and did not require supplementary oxygen. Upon transfer out of ICU, there were 24 patients (47.1%) who were dependent walkers (defined as FAC of 0-3) with 22 patients (43.1%) who were dependent in 1 or more basic ADLs. However, upon discharge, a majority achieved independence in ambulation and basic ADLs (92.2% and 90.2% respectively). All 41 patients (80.4%) who required continuous supplementary oxygen upon transferring out of ICU did not require supplementary oxygen on discharge.

Phishing websites aim to access and retrieve users’ important information such as personal identification, social security number, password, e-mail, credit card, and other account information. Several anti-phishing techniques have been developed to cope with the increasing number of phishing attacks so far. Machine learning and particularly, deep learning algorithms are nowadays the most crucial techniques used to detect and prevent phishing attacks because of their strong learning abilities on massive datasets and their state-of-the-art results in many classification problems. Previously, two types of feature extraction techniques [i.e., character embedding-based and manual natural language processing (NLP) feature extraction] were used in isolation. However, researchers did not consolidate these features and therefore, the performance was not remarkable. Unlike previous works, our study presented an approach that utilizes both feature extraction techniques. We discussed how to combine these feature extraction techniques to fully utilize from the available data. This paper proposes hybrid deep learning models based on long short-term memory and deep neural network algorithms for detecting phishing uniform resource locator and evaluates the performance of the models on phishing datasets. The proposed hybrid deep learning models utilize both character embedding and NLP features, thereby simultaneously exploiting deep connections between characters and revealing NLP-based high-level connections.

The clinical presentation and mortality pattern of COVID-19 are different for patients with comorbidities and without comorbidities. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical presentation of COVID-19 and risk factors for COVID-19 mortality among diabetic patients in a tertiary care hospital in South India. METHODS: A record-based longitudinal study was conducted by reviewing the case records of COVID-19 patients admitted for treatment from June 2020 to September 2020 in a tertiary care centre in South India. Potential risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were analysed using univariate binomial logistic regression, generalized linear models (GLM) with the Poisson distribution. Survival curves were made using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Out of 200 COVID-19 patients with diabetes with a mean (SD) age of 56.1 (11.8) years, 61% were men. The median survival time was slightly lesser in male COVID-19 patients (15 days) as compared to female patients (16 days). The risk of mortality among COVID-19 patients with diabetes is increased for patients who presented with breathlessness (aRR=4.5 (95% CI: 2.3-8.8)), had positive history of smoking (aRR=1.9 (95% CI: 1.1-3.8)), who had CKD (aRR=1.8 (95% CI: 1.1-2.8)) and who had cardiac illness (aRR=1.6 (95% CI: 0.9-2.7)). CONCLUSION: Diabetes patients with COVID-19 need to be given additional care and monitoring especially if they present with breathlessness, positive history of smoking, cardiac illness and, CKD.

We assessed the factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and severe outcomes among people living with HIV. METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study using data from the PISCIS cohort of people with HIV in Catalonia (Spain) between March 1 and Dec 15, 2020. We linked PISCIS data with integrated health-care, clinical, and surveillance registries through the Public Data Analysis for Health Research and Innovation Program of Catalonia (PADRIS) to obtain data on SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, chronic comorbidities, as well as clinical and mortality outcomes. Participants were aged at least 16 years in care at 16 hospitals in Catalonia. Factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses and severe outcomes were assessed using univariable and multivariable Cox regression models. We estimated the effect of immunosuppression on severe outcomes (hospital admission for >24 h with dyspnoea, tachypnoea, hypoxaemia, asphyxia, or hyperventilation; or death) using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. FINDINGS: We linked 20 847 (72·8%) of 28 666 participants in the PISCIS cohort with PADRIS data; 13 142 people had HIV. 749 (5·7%) people with HIV were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2: their median age was 43·5 years (IQR 37·0–52·7), 131 (17·5%) were female, and 618 (82·5%) were male. 103 people with HIV (13·8%) were hospitalised, seven (0·9%) admitted to intensive care, and 13 (1·7%) died. SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was more common among migrants (adjusted hazard ratio 1·55, 95% CI 1·31–1·83), men who have sex with men (1·42, 1·09–1·86), and those with four or more chronic comorbidities (1·46, 1·09–1·97). Age at least 75 years (5·2, 1·8–15·3), non-Spanish origin (2·1, 1·3–3·4), and neuropsychiatric (1·69, 1·07–2·69), autoimmune disease (1·92, 1·14–3·23), respiratory disease (1·84, 1·09–3·09), and metabolic disease (2·59, 1·59–4·23) chronic comorbidities were associated with increased risk of severe outcomes. A Kaplan-Meier estimator showed differences in the risk of severe outcomes according to CD4 cell count in patients with detectable HIV RNA (p=0·039) but no differences were observed in patients with undetectable HIV RNA (p=0·15).

618443,The Implications of Zinc Therapy in Combating the COVID-19 Global Pandemic,2021-02-26,"Dental professionals have a major role in the fight against the spread and transmission of COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate awareness and practice of dentists in Saudi Arabia regarding COVID-19 and the utilization of infection control methods. A 24-item questionnaire was developed and distributed through social media to 627 dentists working in Saudi Arabia. 177 questionnaires were completed (28.2% response rate). Most dentists were aware about the transmission, incubation time and main clinical symptoms of COVID-19. Almost 83% of the respondents appreciate the risk of droplets, aerosols and airborne particles in transmission of COVID-19 in the dental clinic. Among the common practices of participants are measuring patient’s body temperature before undertaking a dental treatment (88.7%), cleaning the environmental surfaces at the dental clinic after each patient (91.5%) and restriction of dental treatment to emergency cases (82.5%). It seems that practicing dentists in Saudi Arabia are fairly aware about COVID-19. The practices of the surveyed dentists appear to be mostly consistent with the current guidelines and recommendations for infection control of COVID-19 in the dental clinic. Some drawbacks in knowledge and a number of inappropriate practices can be identified and require the attention of health authorities.","Tarakji, Bassel; Nassani, Mohammad Zakaria; Alali, Faisal Mehsen; B.

618701,Exploring the Immediate Effects of COVID-19 Containment Policies on Crime: an Empirical Analysis of the Short-Term Aftermath in Los Angeles,2020-10-19,"[Image: see text] The suggested bat origin for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has revitalized the studies of other bat-derived coronaviruses with respect to interspecies transmission potential. Bat coronavirus (BatCoV) HKU9 is an important betacoronavirus (betaCoV) that is phylogenetically affiliated with the same genus as MERS-CoV. The bat surveillance data indicated that BatCoV HKU9 has been widely spreading and circulating in bats. This highlights the necessity of characterizing the virus for its potential to cross species barriers. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the coronavirus spike (S) protein recognizes host receptors to mediate virus entry and is therefore a key factor determining the viral tropism and transmission capacity. In this study, the putative S RBD of BatCoV HKU9 (HKU9-RBD), which is homologous to other betaCoV RBDs that have been structurally and functionally defined, was characterized via a series of biophysical and crystallographic methods. By using surface plasmon resonance, we demonstrated that HKU9-RBD binds to neither SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 nor MERS-CoV receptor CD26. We further determined the atomic structure of HKU9-RBD, which as expected is composed of a core and an external subdomain. The core subdomain fold resembles those of other betaCoV RBDs, whereas the external subdomain is structurally unique with a single helix, explaining the inability of HKU9-RBD to react with either ACE2 or CD26. Via comparison of the available RBD structures, we further proposed a homologous intersubdomain binding mode in betaCoV RBDs that anchors the external subdomain to the core subdomain. The revealed RBD features would shed light on the evolution route of betaCoV.","Huang, Canping; Qi, Jianxun; Lu, Guangwen; Wang, Qihui; Yuan, Yuan; Wu, Ying; Zhang, Yanfang; Yan, Jinghua; Gao, George F.",Biochemistry,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.biochem.6b00790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27696819/,585

Our data suggest that the CNS has high potential for elimination of T-cell-dependent inflammation, whereas this mechanism is less effective in the PNS, and is almost absent in other tissues such as muscle and skin. Interestingly, several conventional and novel immunotherapeutic approaches, such as glucocorticosteroid and high-dose antigen therapy, induce T-cell apoptosis in situ. In vitro experiments suggest different scenarios for the mechanisms by which specific cellular and humoral elements in the nervous system synergize and sensitize T cells for apoptosis in vivo. We also discuss regulatory, proapoptotic mechanisms, such as the Fas–FasL system and galectin-1, that have been utilized in other tissues to mediate immune protection.","Gold, Ralf; Hartung, Hans-Peter; Lassmann, Hans",Trends Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9292968/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166223697010795; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166223697010795,585

The results will lead the way for future functional proteomics studies. The antibody profile that was induced by the QS mutant differed from that of the parent strain. Detailed comparison of the antibody profiles, according to the proteins’ functional annotations, showed that QS affects the expression of many virulence-associated proteins of Y. pestis. The antibodies to many virulence-associated proteins were not detected or lower titers of antibodies to many proteins were detected in the sera of rabbits immunized with the QS mutant, relative to those of the wild type, which indicated that these proteins were not expressed or expressed at relatively lower levels in the QS mutant. The results demonstrated that antibody profiling by protein microarrays is a promising high-throughput method for revealing the interactions between pathogens and the host immune system.","Chen, Zeliang; Li, Bei; Zhang, Jianshan; Qin, Long; Zhou, Dongsheng; Han, Yanping; Du, Zongmin; Guo, Zhaobiao; Song, Yajun; Yang, Ruifu",Microbes Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457906002383; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457906002383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16997598/,585

We aimed at describing the longitudinal brain metabolic pattern in COVID-19-related encephalopathy using 18F-FDG-PET/CT. METHODS: Seven patients with variable clinical presentations of COVID-19-related encephalopathy were explored thrice with brain 18F-FDG-PET/CT, once in the acute phase, 1 month later and 6 months after COVID-19 onset. PET images were analysed with voxel-wise and regions-of-interest approaches in comparison with 32 healthy controls. RESULTS: Patients’ neurological manifestations during acute encephalopathy were heterogeneous. However, all of them presented with predominant cognitive and behavioural frontal disorders. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in the CSF was negative for all patients. MRI revealed no specific abnormalities for most of the subjects. All patients had a consistent pattern of hypometabolism in a widespread cerebral network including the frontal cortex, anterior cingulate, insula and caudate nucleus. Six months after COVID-19 onset, the majority of patients clinically had improved but cognitive and emotional disorders of varying severity remained with attention/executive disabilities and anxio-depressive symptoms, and lasting prefrontal, insular and subcortical 18F-FDG-PET/CT abnormalities. CONCLUSION: The implication of this widespread network could be the neural substrate of clinical features observed in patients with COVID-19, such as frontal lobe syndrome, emotional disturbances and deregulation of respiratory failure perception. This study suggests that this network remains mildly to severely impaired 6 months after disease onset.","Kas, Aurélie; Soret, Marine; Pyatigoskaya, Nadya; Habert, Marie-Odile; Hesters, Adèle; Le Guennec, Loic; Paccoud, Olivier; Bombois, Stéphanie; Delorme, Cécile",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33452633/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-020-05178-y,585

METHODS: Patients admitted to medical wards in an acute hospital were recruited prospectively from May 1, 2004 to April 30, 2005. Sputum culture, blood culture, paired serology, and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) studies were performed. Spirometry was assessed in stable phase at 2–3 months post-hospital discharge. RESULTS: Seventy eight subjects were admitted for AECOPD with concomitant pneumonia. The mean (SD) age was 77.1 (7.5) years, with FEV(1) of 41.5 (20.8)% predicted normal. Overall, an infectious etiology could be established in 48.7% of the subjects. Among the 71 subjects with sputum collected, 40.8% had positive bacterial culture. The commonest bacteria identified were Streptococcus pneumoniae (8[11.3%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7[9.9%]) and Haemophilus influenzae (7[9.9%]). Among the 66 subjects with NPA collected, 9.0 and 12.2% had positive viral culture and PCR results, respectively. The commonest viruses identified by NPA PCR were influenza A (4[6.1%] subjects) and rhinovirus (2[3.0%]). Paired serology was positive in 4.4%. Patients on high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (>1000 mcg beclomethasone-equivalent/day) had a higher rate of positive sputum bacterial culture than those on low-medium dose of ICS (50.0% vs 18.2%, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: An infectious etiology could be established in about half of patients hospitalized with AECOPD and concomitant pneumonia. The majority of identifiable causes were bacterial. Patients on high dose ICS might have impaired airway defense as reflected by the higher rate of positive sputum culture.","Ko, Fanny W.S.; Ip, Margaret; Chan, Paul K.S.; Ng, Susanna S.S.; Chau, S.S.; Hui, David S.C.",Respir Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2008.03.019; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0954611108001297; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18573648/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954611108001297,585

Hypoxic tumor cells undergo broadly metabolic and molecular adaptations and communicate with surrounding cells to provide conditions promising for their homeostasis and metastasis. Extracellular vesicles such as exosomes originating from the endosomal pathway carry different types of biomolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids; participate in cell-to-cell communication. The exposure of cancer cells to hypoxic conditions, not only, increases exosomes biogenesis and secretion but also alters exosomes cargo. Under the hypoxic condition, different signaling pathways such as HIFs, Rab-GTPases, NF-κB, and tetraspanin are involved in the exosomes biogenesis. Hypoxic tumor cells release exosomes that induce tumorigenesis through promoting metastasis, angiogenesis, and modulating immune responses. Exosomes from hypoxic tumor cells hold great potential for clinical application and cancer diagnosis. Besides, targeting the biogenesis of these exosomes may be a therapeutic opportunity for reducing tumorigenesis. Exosomes can serve as a drug delivery system transferring therapeutic compounds to cancer cells. Understanding the detailed mechanisms involved in biogenesis and functions of exosomes under hypoxic conditions may help to develop effective therapies against cancer.","Jafari, Reza; Rahbarghazi, Reza; Ahmadi, Mahdi; Hassanpour, Mehdi; Rezaie, Jafar",J Transl Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02662-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33302971/,585

We adopt heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) time series models and discuss the statistical inference for various COVID-19 data. Seven data sets such as cumulative confirmed (CC) case, cumulative recovered (CR) case and cumulative death (CD) case as well as recovery rate, fatality rate and infection rates for 14 and 21 days are handled for the statistical analysis. In the HAR models, model selections of orders are conducted by evaluating root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) as well as [Formula: see text] , AIC, and BIC. As a result of estimation, we provide coefficients estimates, standard errors and 95% confidence intervals in the HAR models. Our results report that fitted values via the HAR models are not only well-matched with the real cumulative cases but also differenced values from the fitted HAR models are well-matched with real daily cases. Additionally, because the CC and the CD cases are strongly correlated, we use a bivariate HAR model for the two data sets. Out-of-sample forecastings are carried out with the COVID-19 data sets to obtain multi-step ahead predicted values and 95% prediction intervals. As for the forecasting performances, four accuracy measures such as RMSE, MAE, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root relative square error (RRSE) are evaluated. Contributions of this work are three folds: First, it is shown that the HAR models fit well to cumulative numbers of the COVID-19 data along with good criterion results. Second, a variety of analysis are studied for the COVID-19 series: confirmed, recovered, death cases, as well as the related rates. Third, forecast accuracy measures are evaluated as small values of errors, and thus it is concluded that the HAR model provides a good prediction model for the COVID-19.","Hwang, Eunju; Yu, SeongMin",Results Phys,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211379721007233?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211379721007233; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2021.104631; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34458082/,585

Neonatal hyperoxia that is a risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia confers susceptibility to influenza A virus (IAV) infection later in life. Given our previous findings that the circadian clock protects against IAV, we asked if the long-term impact of neonatal hyperoxia vis-à-vis IAV infection includes circadian disruption. Here, we show that neonatal hyperoxia abolishes the clock-mediated time of day protection from IAV in mice, independent of viral burden through host tolerance pathways. We discovered that the lung intrinsic clock (and not the central or immune clocks) mediated this dysregulation. Loss of circadian protein, Bmal1, in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells recapitulates the increased mortality, loss of temporal gating, and other key features of hyperoxia-exposed animals.

X-ray diffraction analysis and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of Ag nano-particles and ZnO nano-structure. The elemental and chemical state of the elements present in the AZO nano-composite were assessed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The antibacterial activity of AZE samples against both Escherichia coli and S. aureus strains including MRSA was evaluated in antibacterial and morphological analyses. The AZE3 sample showed greater antibacterial activity than the other samples and was comparable to erythromycin. AZE3 was ~20-fold less prone to developing bacterial resistance following multiple exposures to bacteria compared to erythromycin alone. The AZE3 nano-composite showed good biocompatibility with 293 human embryonic kidney cells.

626777,Three lessons conservation science can learn from the COVID‐19 pandemic,2020-10-21,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes COVID-19, a pandemic that seriously threatens global health. SARS CoV-2 propagates by packaging its RNA genome into membrane enclosures in host cells. The packaging of the viral genome into the nascent virion is mediated by the nucleocapsid (N) protein, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that the N protein forms biomolecular condensates with viral RNA both in vitro and in mammalian cells. While the N protein forms spherical assemblies with unstructured RNA, it forms mesh like-structures with viral RNA strands that contain secondary structure elements. Cross-linking mass spectrometry identified an intrinsically-disordered region that forms interactions between N proteins in condensates, and truncation of this region disrupts phase separation. By screening 1,200 FDA approved drugs in vitro, we identified a kinase inhibitor nilotinib, which affects the morphology of N condensates in vitro and disrupts phase separation of the N protein in vivo. These results indicate that the N protein compartmentalizes viral RNA in infected cells through liquid-liquid phase separation, and this process can be disrupted by a possible drug candidate.","Jack, Amanda; Ferro, Luke S.; Trnka, Michael J.; Wehri, Eddie; Nadgir, Amrut; Costa, Katelyn; Schaletzky, Julia; Yildiz, Ahmet",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32995779/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.14.295824,585

628069,Backslide or forward progress? Virtual care at U.S. healthcare systems beyond the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-01-08,"The rapid expansion of COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic. In order to avoid excessive restriction to the social activity, a good strategy of quarantine is needed. Several epidemic models with a quarantine compartment such as susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-removed (SEIQR) model have been applied. However, in the actual situation, the infection test and quarantine is often delayed from the beginning of the infectious stage. This article presents a delayed SEIQR model to analyze the effect of the delay of quarantine, and to suggest a guideline for the measure. The latency period (compartment E) was assumed to be 3 days, and the start of quarantine action was assumed to be delayed by 4 to 10 days from infection. The actual PCR test-positive number data from March 10th to July 18th in 2020 was analyzed to estimate a transmission rate and the basic reproduction number. The area where the infection expansion is restrained was displayed in the two parameter space (transmission rate and quarantine rate) for several possible lengths of the delay of quarantine. As a result, it was shown to be very hard to restrain the expansion of infection only by a simple quarantine action retaining the delay. As a short term measure, it was found to be necessary to reduce the transmission rate through some kind of restriction of social activity, but as a long term measure, it was found to be possible to maintain the social activity by shortening the delay of quarantine through expanding the infection test system to find earlier stage patients, including asymptomatic infectious patients. In order to shed light to this conclusion from a different viewpoint, this model was applied in another case that an additional quarantine was taken into account before the delay. The result was shown to have a similar effect as that of the shortening of the delay.","Maki, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.18.20177709v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177709,585

To meet a customer’s demand, the company then arranges for the pickups from different restaurants, perhaps located distantly, before delivering them to the customer. The company caters to a set of such customers, through a fleet of capacitated vehicles. In this paper, we propose an augmented two-index formulation to find least cost vehicle routes to satisfy the set of customer requests under the constraints of time windows of the pickup and delivery locations along with the capacity constraints of the fleet of vehicles. We use branch-and-cut algorithm to solve the benchmark problem instances. The proposed formulation and the problem specific valid inequalities lead to more efficient solution performance as against the existing formulations. The computational experiments indicate that the proposed approach can solve a majority of benchmark problem instances with 25, 35 and 50 nodes, many of which were reported unsolved using exact solution approaches in the extant literature.","Kohar, Amit; Jakhar, Suresh Kumar",Ann Oper Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34131357/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10479-021-04145-6,585

Amid the increasing number of global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, there is a need for a quick and easy method to obtain a non-invasive sample for the detection of this novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to investigate the potential use of saliva samples as a non-invasive tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods. From 27 March to 4 April, 2020, we prospectively collected saliva samples and a standard nasopharyngeal and throat swab in persons seeking care at an acute respiratory infection clinic in a university hospital during the outbreak of COVID-19. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed, and the results of the two specimens were compared. Results. Two-hundred pairs of the samples were collected. Sixty-nine (34.5%) patients were male, and the median (interquartile) age was 36 (28-48) years. Using nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR as the reference standard, the prevalence of COVID-19 diagnosed by nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR was 9.5%. The sensitivity and specificity of the saliva sample RT-PCR were 84.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 79.2%-89.3%], and 98.9% (95% CI 97.5-100.3%), respectively. An analysis of the agreement between the two specimens demonstrated 97.5% observed agreement (kappa coefficient 0.851, 95% CI 0.723-0.979; p <0.001). Conclusions. Saliva specimens can be used for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The collection method is non-invasive, and non-aerosol generating. Using a saliva sample as a specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 could facilitate the diagnosis of the disease, which is one of the strategies that helps in controlling the epidemic.","Pasomsub, Ekawat; Watcharananan, Siriorn P.; Boonyawat, Kochawan; Janchompoo, Pareena; Wongtabtim, Garanyuta; Suksuwan, Worramin; Sungkanuparph, Somnuek; Phuphuakrat, Angsana",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.17.20070045v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.20070045,585

In considering the value of different basal insulin therapies, although acquisition costs are of increasing importance to budget-constrained healthcare systems, value beyond simple price considerations should be taken into account. Whilst human basal insulins are of lower acquisition cost compared to long-acting insulin analogues, this difference in price has the potential to be offset in terms of total healthcare system value through the ultra-long duration of action and low variability in glucose-lowering activity which have been translated into real clinical benefits, in particular a reduced risk of hypoglycaemic events. The maintenance of glycaemic targets and avoidance of hypoglycaemia that have been associated with insulin analogues represent a significant value consideration, beyond price, for the use of basal insulin analogues to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus from the perspective of all stakeholders within the healthcare system, including payers, healthcare professionals, patients and society.","Evans, Marc; Morgan, Angharad R.; Bain, Stephen C.",Diabetes Ther,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13300-021-01061-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33899150/,585

Although SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins have been detected in serum of COVID-19 patients, their dynamics and association with outcomes have not been characterized. Methods: A total of 116 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulins tested in Tongji hospital were retrospectively investigated. Clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics and outcomes data were compared between mild-moderate group and died group. Further, a paired case-control study was conducted where each deceased case was matched to three mild-moderate patients of similar age. Findings: Among 116 subjects included, 101 mild-moderate patients survived and 15 cases died. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM levels peaked in forth week after onset of COVID-19 pneumonia, while serum IgG levels increased over 8 weeks. Serum IgM levels were higher in deceased patients than mild-moderate patients (P = 0.024), but not IgG. Serum IgM levels were negatively correlated with clinical outcome, eosinophil count and albumin levels (r = -0.269, P = 0.003; r = -0.188, P = 0.043; and r = -0.198, P = 0.033, resp.). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for IgM antibody was 0.681 (95% CI: 0.517-0.845, P = 0.024). In case-control study paired by age, serum IgM was higher in deceased patients than mild-moderate patients (P = 0.019), positively correlated with leucocyte count (r = 0.260, P = 0.045), while negatively correlated with clinical outcome and albumin levels (r = -0.337, P = 0.008; r = -0.265, P = 0.041). AUC for IgM levels was 0.704 (95% CI: 0.534-0.873, P = 0.019). Interpretation: These results indicate that dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies was similar with that of SARS-CoV, while elevated serum IgM levels indicate poor outcome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Wang, Zhihua; Li, Huijun; Li, Jingjing; Yang, Chunguang; Guo, Xiaolin; Hu, Zhiquan; Chen, Zhiqiang; Wang, Shaogang; Liu, Jihong",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.20041285,585

A variety of mechanisms may underlie the observed gender-related disparities including differences in sex hormones. However, the precise mechanisms by which female sex hormones may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity remains unknown. Here we report new insights into the molecular basis of the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and the human ACE2 receptor. We further observed that glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor enhances SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Importantly estrogens can disrupt glycan-glycan interactions and glycan-protein interactions between the human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV2 thereby blocking its entry into cells. In a mouse model, estrogens reduced ACE2 glycosylation and thereby alveolar uptake of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These results shed light on a putative mechanism whereby female sex hormones may provide protection from developing severe infection and could inform the development of future therapies against COVID-19.","Aguilar-Pineda, Jorge Alberto; Albaghdadi, Mazen; Jiang, Wanlin; Lopez, Karin J.

633445,COVID-19 challenges to dentistry in the new pandemic epicenter: Brazil,2020-06-14,"Abstract The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the disease caused by it, COVID-19, have spread to virtually all countries worldwide within just a few months. The economic and sanitary impact has been enormous. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. How to effectively prevent and control SARS-CoV-2 transmission while providing care to surgical patients during the pandemic is a crucial topic. In order to minimize the risk of cross-infection between patients and physicians, many hospitals have taken measures to limit outpatient services, elective hospitalizations, and the number of operations. Based on the prevention and control measures stipulated by major medical institutions in China, this overview provides recommendations for surgeons from three aspects: outpatient treatment, ward management and perioperative protection. Telemedicine should be encouraged as a means of social distancing. Outpatient examination should be selected. Reasonable spatial arrangement and effective environmental disinfection are important for ward management. Patient selection for surgery and timing of operations should be carefully discussed within multi-disciplinary teams. Appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn adapted to the situational risk. On December 31, 2019, China reported to the WHO Country Office a pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan [2,4]. Subsequently, the disease later named COVID-19 affected a substantial proportion of the population in Wuhan and spread to other areas of China. Relying on a nationwide shutdown and mandatory quarantine, China has effectively curtailed the domestic outbreak. However, due to the high transmissibility of SARS-Cov-2 and the mobility of people, COVID-19 spread to the rest of the world. Many hospitals worldwide were faced with confirmed and suspected SARS-Cov-2 infections, putting a huge strain on the safety of patients and employees. Consequently, surgical patients who seek medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic present significant challenges. This paper summarizes medical care and infection prevention and control in general surgery patients during the COVID-19, pandemic in the light of the current situation in China. It provides reference for surgeons and decision makers in health care in other countries suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liu, Fenglin; Wang, Weibin; Yu, Hong; Wang, Yong; Wu, Wenming; Qin, Xinyu; Zhao, Yupei",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666262020300061?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666262020300061,585

Cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 include heart failure, cardiomyopathy, acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias, and venous thromboembolism. This article aims to collect scientific evidence by exploiting PubMed, Scopus, and Pedro databases to highlight the cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 and to define the physiotherapy treatment recommended for these patients. Exercise training (ET), an important part of cardiac rehabilitation, is a powerful tool in physiotherapy, capable of inducing significant changes in the cardiovascular system and functional in the recovery of endothelial dysfunction and for the containment of thromboembolic complications. In conclusion, due to the wide variety of possible exercise programs that can be obtained by combining intensity, duration, and speed in various ways, and by adjusting the program based on continuous patient monitoring, exercise training is well suited to the treatment of post-COVID patients with an impaired cardiovascular system of various degrees.","Calabrese, Mariaconsiglia; Garofano, Marina; Palumbo, Roberta; Di Pietro, Paola; Izzo, Carmine; Damato, Antonio; Venturini, Eleonora; Iesu, Severino; Virtuoso, Nicola; Strianese, Andrea; Ciccarelli, Michele; Galasso, Gennaro; Vecchione, Carmine",Life (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33801080/; https://doi.org/10.3390/life11030259,585

Collecting data through parental surveys in a school in the province of Barcelona, I obtain information about the parental labour market status before and after the Great Recession. I can then link this information to repeated information on their children’s school performance, for a sample of over 300 students. Using individual fixed effects, the estimates show a negative and significant decrease on average grades of around 15% of a standard deviation after father’s job loss. These results are mainly driven by those students whose fathers suffer long unemployment spells. In contrast, the average impact of mother’s job loss on school performance is close to zero and non-significant. The decline in school performance during the Great Recession after father’s job loss, particularly among disadvantaged students, could result in detrimental long-term effects that might contribute to increased inequality.

The aim of this study was to explore the risk factors for myocardial injury and death and to investigate whether myocardial injury has an independent association with all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: This is a single-centre cohort study including consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 undergoing chest CT on admission. Myocardial injury was defined as high-sensitivity troponin I >20 ng/L on admission. A total of 332 patients with a median follow-up of 12 days were included. There were 68 (20.5%) deaths; 123 (37%) patients had myocardial injury. PA diameter was higher in patients with myocardial injury compared with patients without myocardial injury [29.0 (25th–75th percentile, 27–32) mm vs. 27.7 (25–30) mm, P < 0.001). PA diameter was independently associated with an increased risk of myocardial injury [adjusted odds ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02–1.19, P = 0.01] and death [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.09, 95% CI 1.02–1.17, P = 0.01]. Compared with patients without myocardial injury, patients with myocardial injury had a lower prevalence of a CAC score of zero (25% vs. 55%, P < 0.001); however, the CAC score did not emerge as a predictor of myocardial injury by multivariable logistic regression. Myocardial injury was independently associated with an increased risk of death by multivariable Cox regression (adjusted HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.27–3.96, P = 0.005). Older age, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, and lower PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio on admission were other independent predictors for both myocardial injury and death. CONCLUSIONS: An increased PA diameter, as assessed by chest CT, is an independent risk factor for myocardial injury and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Myocardial injury is independently associated with an approximately two-fold increased risk of death.","Ferrante, Giuseppe; Fazzari, Fabio; Cozzi, Ottavia; Maurina, Matteo; Bragato, Renato; D’Orazio, Federico; Torrisi, Chiara; Lanza, Ezio; Indolfi, Eleonora; Donghi, Valeria; Mantovani, Riccardo; Liccardo, Gaetano; Voza, Antonio; Azzolini, Elena; Balzarini, Luca; Reimers, Bernhard; Stefanini, Giulio G; Condorelli, Gianluigi; Monti, Lorenzo",Cardiovasc Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32637999/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvaa193,585

To determine whether D614G might also mediate neutralization-escape that could compromise vaccine efficacy, sera from Spike-immunized mice, nonhuman primates and humans were evaluated for neutralization of pseudoviruses bearing either D614 or G614 spike. In all cases, the G614 pseudovirus was moderately more susceptible to neutralization. The G614 pseudovirus also was more susceptible to neutralization by receptor binding domain (RBD) monoclonal antibodies and convalescent sera from people infected with either form of the virus. Negative stain electron microscopy revealed a higher percentage of the 1-RBD “up” conformation in the G614 spike, suggesting increased epitope exposure as a mechanism of enhanced vulnerability to neutralization.

The authors describe a collaboration between librarians and health professionals to connect with underserved community members by teaching the basics of good nutrition and healthy meal preparation. CASE PRESENTATION: Two health sciences librarians provided instruction to community members in the use of quality health information resources during various modules of the culinary medicine curriculum. Demonstrations of the use of MedlinePlus and ChooseMyPlate were conducted using topics from module content. Evaluations were distributed after each module to evaluate the effectiveness of the library component, the results of which enabled librarians to subsequently increase their instruction time and implement iPad use for more engaging participation. CONCLUSION: Librarians were seen as invaluable partners in this innovative program and became an integral part of the curriculum. Evaluation results helped librarians advocate for more instructional time. As a result of their involvement, librarians were given additional outreach opportunities to educate younger populations at risk of developing chronic health diseases.","Lemley, Trey; Fenske, Rachel Finch",Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA,https://doi.org/10.5195/jmla.2020.911; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33013221/,585

The empirical results show that China’s energy embodied in both normal and processing exports first increased in 2005-2008, dropped in 2009 due to the global financial crisis, and then rose again after 2009, and finally dropped in 2014-2015. The embodied energy in trade as a percentage of total energy consumption in China was relatively stable before and after the global financial crisis, at around 28% over the 2005-2008 period, and 22% over the 2009-2015 period. The contribution of the aggregate embodied intensity (AEI) of exports to China’s aggregate energy intensity dropped from 30% in 2005 to 21% in 2015. Among China’s trading partners, the United States, Japan and Korea together accounted for around half of China’s embodied energy and AEI in exports in 2005, but their shares dropped to only one third in 2015. Energy efficiency improvement played the key role in reducing the embodied energy and intensity in China’s exports. Similar analysis can be applied to other regions and indicators.","Zhu, Bangzhu; Su, Bin; Li, Yingzhu; Ng, Tsan Sheng",Energy Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904409/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988320302516?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140988320302516; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2020.104911,585

Medical records of these patients were reviewed using the EPIC electronic health record system. Clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were reviewed against periods of bradycardia in each patient. Both of the patients presented with dizziness and presyncope related to sinus bradycardia in which they received treatment with 1 mg of IV atropine and theophylline 200 mg orally. We share these two cases of theophylline treatment in COVID-19 induced sinus bradycardia. The first patient was a 39-year-old female, with a past medical history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, who presented to the emergency department with lightheadedness and dizziness. Two weeks prior to her presentation, she was tested positive for COVID-19 infection that was treated with azithromycin, dexamethasone and aspirin. Upon presentation, her ECG showed sinus bradycardia at a rate of 48 bpm. The second patient, a 21-year-old female with no significant past medical history, presented with presyncope. Three weeks prior to her presentation, she tested positive for COVID-19 infection that was treated symptomatically at her home. Upon presentation, her ECG showed junctional rhythm at a heart rate of 51 bpm.","Sawalha, Khalid; Habash, Fuad J.; Vallurupalli, Srikanth; Paydak, Hakan",Clin Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34205865/; https://doi.org/10.3390/clinpract11020047,585

637312,Social media panic and COVID-19 in India,2020-04-18,"BACKGROUND: Repair of a ventral hernia is increasingly being performed by a laparoscopic approach despite lack of good long term follow up data on outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the long term performance of a polyester mesh and to assess its elastic properties in patients undergoing laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. METHODS: All patients being assessed for a ventral hernia repair between August 2011 and November 2013 were placed on a prospective database. Those undergoing laparoscopic repair with a polyester mesh were seen at clinic at one month and one year, while their electronic records were assessed at 34 months (range 24–48 months) and 104 months (range 92–116 months). In addition, CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis performed for any reason on these patients during the follow up period were reviewed by a consultant gastrointestinal radiologist. Mechanical failure testing of the mesh was also performed. RESULTS: Thirty-two of the 100 patients assessed for ventral hernia repair had a laparoscopic repair with a polyester mesh. Nineteen (59%) had CT scans performed during the follow-up period. No recurrence was recorded at 34 months, while three (9.4%) had a recurrence at 104 months. Two had central breakdown of the mesh at 81 and 90 months, while 1 presented acutely at 116 months after operation. Mesh had stretched across the defect by an average of 21% (range 5.7–40%) in nine patients. Mechanical testing showed that this mesh lost its elasticity at low forces ranging between 1.8 and 3.2 N/cm. CONCLUSION: This study shows that late recurrence is a problem following laparoscopic ventral hernia repair with polyester mesh. The mesh loses it elasticity at a low force. This combined with degradation of mesh seems the most likely cause of failure. This is unlikely to be a unique problem of polyester mesh and further long-term studies are required to better assess this operative approach to ventral hernia repair.","O’Dwyer, P.

637413,A structured open dataset of government interventions in response to COVID-19,2020-05-08,"BACKGROUND: A SARS-CoV-2 outbreak affecting 52 people from a large school community in Santiago, Chile was identified (March 12), nine days after the first country case. We assessed the magnitude of the outbreak and the role students and staff played using a self-administered antibody detection test and survey. METHODS: The school was closed on March 13, and the entire community was placed under quarantine. We implemented a home-delivery, self-administered, IgG/IgM antibody test and survey to a classroom stratified sample of students and all staff from May 4-19. We aimed to determine overall seroprevalence rates by age group, reported symptoms, contact exposure and to explore dynamics of transmission. RESULTS: Antibody positivity rates were 9.9% (95%CI: 8.2-11.8) for 1,009 students and 16.6% (95%CI: 12.1-21.9) for 235 staff. Among students, positivity was associated with younger age (P=0.01), lower grade level (P=0.05), prior RT-PCR positivity (P=0.03), and history of contact with a confirmed case (P<0.001). Among staff, positivity was higher in teachers (P=0.01) and in those previously RT-PCR positive (P<0.001). Excluding RT-PCR positive individuals, antibody positivity was associated with fever in adults and children (P=0.02; P=0.002), abdominal pain in children (P=0.001), and chest pain in adults (P=0.02). Within antibody positive individuals, 40% of students and 18% of staff reported no symptoms (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Teachers were more affected during the outbreak and younger children were at higher infection risk, likely because index case(s) were teachers and/or parents from preschool. Self-administered antibody testing, supervised remotely, proved to be a suitable and rapid tool. Our study provides useful information for school re-openings.","Torres, Juan Pablo; Piñera, Cecilia; De La Maza, Verónica; Lagomarcino, Anne J; Simian, Daniela; Torres, Bárbara; Urquidi, Cinthya; Valenzuela, María Teresa; O’Ryan, Miguel",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32649743/,585

The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to occur primarily through direct contact or droplets. There have also been reports that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in biopsy and stool specimens, and it has been postulated that there is potential for fecal–oral transmission as well. Gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in 17.6% of COVID-19 patients and transmission can potentially occur through gastrointestinal secretions in this group of patients. Furthermore, transmission can also occur in asymptomatic carriers or patients with viral shedding during the incubation period. Endoscopic procedures hence may pose significant risks of transmission (even for those not directly involving confirmed COVID-19 cases) as endoscopists and endoscopy staff are in close contact with patients during these aerosol generating procedures. This could result in inadvertent transmission of infection at time of endoscopy.","Teng, Margaret; Tang, Si Ying; Koh, Calvin Jianyi",World J Gastrointest Endosc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32994856/; https://doi.org/10.4253/wjge.v12.i9.256,585

The objective of the present report is to assess and quantify this process. METHODS: We compared the levels of EBM of the publications in the ophthalmic literature on COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic and compared it to those of articles published the prior year during April 2019 for the three highest ranking journals in the field of comprehensive ophthalmology. RESULTS: COVID-19 publications ranked significantly lower (p<0.001). Time between submission and acceptance was significantly shorter for the COVID-19 publications (p<0.001), and significantly more publications were accepted without revisions (P<0.001).

One such challenge is the ability to efficiently recover viral RNA which is typically dependent on sample processing. We evaluated the quantitative effect of six different extraction methods in recovering viral RNA in vectors using negative tick homogenates spiked with serial dilutions of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and surrogate Langat virus (LGTV). Evaluation was performed using qPCR and mNGS. Sensitivity and proof of concept of optimal method was tested using naturally positive TBEV tick homogenates and positive dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus mosquito homogenates. The amount of observed viral genome copies, percentage of mapped reads, and genome coverage varied among different extractions methods. The developed Method 5 gave a 120.8-, 46-, 2.5-, 22.4-, and 9.9-fold increase in the number of viral reads mapping to the expected pathogen in comparison to Method 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, respectively. Our developed Method 5 termed ROVIV (Recovery of Viruses in Vectors) greatly improved viral RNA recovery and identification in vectors using mNGS. Therefore, it may be a more sensitive method for use in arbovirus surveillance.","Akello, Joyce Odeke; Leib, Stephen L.; Engler, Olivier; Beuret, Christian",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12050562; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32438629/,585

Based on our collective ethnographic work in three global cities in the U.S. (San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Detroit), we identify how the political geography of racialisation potentiated the COVID-19 crisis, exacerbating the social and economic toll of the pandemic for non-white communities, and undercut the public health response. Our analysis is specific to the current COVID19 crisis in the U.S, however the lessons from these cases are important for understanding and responding to the corrosive political processes that have entrenched inequality in pandemics around the world.","Whitacre, Ryan; Oni-Orisan, Adeola; Gaber, Nadia; Martinez, Carlos; Buchbinder, Liza; Herd, Denise; M Holmes, Seth",Glob Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2021.1908395; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33784231/,585
641134,Repurposing Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors for COVID-19: Rationale and Concerns,2020-11-02,"Ebola virus is a continuing threat to human populations, causing a virulent hemorrhagic fever disease characterized by dysregulation of both the innate and adaptive host immune responses. Severe cases are distinguished by an early, elevated pro-inflammatory response followed by a pronounced lymphopenia with B and T cells unable to mount an effective anti-viral response. The precise mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of the host immune system are poorly understood. In recent years, focus on host-derived miRNAs showed these molecules to play an important role in the host gene regulation arsenal. Here, we describe an investigation of RNA biomarkers in the fatal Ebola virus disease (EVD) cynomolgus macaque model. We monitored both host mRNA and miRNA responses in whole blood longitudinally over the disease course in these non-human primates (NHPs). Analysis of the interactions between these classes of RNAs revealed several miRNA markers significantly correlated with downregulation of genes; specifically, the analysis revealed those involved in dysregulated immune pathways associated with EVD. In particular, we noted strong interactions between the miRNAs hsa-miR-122-5p and hsa-miR-125b-5p with immunological genes regulating both B and T-cell activation. This promising set of biomarkers will be useful in future studies of severe EVD pathogenesis in both NHPs and humans and may serve as potential prognostic targets.","Stefan, Christopher P.; Arnold, Catherine E.; Shoemaker, Charles J.; Zumbrun, Elizabeth E.; Altamura, Louis A.; Douglas, Christina E.; Taylor-Howell, Cheryl L.; Graham, Amanda S.; Delp, Korey L.; Blancett, Candace D.; Ricks, Keersten M.; Olschner, Scott P.; Shamblin, Joshua D.; Wollen, Suzanne E.; Zelko, Justine M.; Bloomfield, Holly A.; Sprague, Thomas R.; Esham, Heather L.; Minogue, Timothy D.",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9030665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33806942/,585

The effects of COVID-19 on different sub-populations, and its key epidemiologic parameters remain unknown or highly uncertain. We investigated the epidemiology of COVID-19 from January to August of 2020 in an established academic monitoring cohort of N = 9,697 middle-aged World Trade Center responders residing in Long Island, NY. METHODS: A seroprevalence survey and a series of cross-sectional surveys were nested in a prospective cohort study. Measures included IgG antibody testing, SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, review of electronic medical records, and surveys of symptoms. Correlates of infection were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: The cohort was predominantly men in their mid-fifties; 6,597 cohort members were successfully contacted (68%); 1,042 (11%) individuals participated in the seroprevalence survey; and 369 individuals (5.6% of 6,597 study participants) underwent PCR testing. The estimated standardized cumulative incidence was 21.9% (95%CI: 20.1–23.9%), the asymptomatic proportion was 16.4% (36/219; 95%CI: 11.8–22.0%), the case hospitalization ratio was 9.4% (36/385; 95%CI: 6.6–12.7%), the case fatality ratio was 1.8% (7/385; 95%CI: 0.7–3.7%), and the hospitalization fatality ratio was 8.3% (3/36; 95%CI: 1.8–22.5%). Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with younger age, race/ethnicity, and being currently employed. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study suggest a high cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among WTC responders in the spring and summer of 2020 and contribute to narrowing the plausible range of the proportion of infections that exhibit no symptoms. An increased risk of infection among younger employed individuals is likely to reflect a higher probability of exposure to the virus, and the racial disparities in the infection risk warrant further investigation.","Morozova, Olga; Clouston, Sean A.

The first reports came in December 2019 from the city of Wuhan in the province of Hubei in China. It was immediately clear that children developed a milder disease than adults. The reasons for the milder course of the disease were attributed to several factors: innate immunity, difference in ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme II) receptor expression, and previous infections with other common coronaviruses (CovH). This literature review aims to summarize aspects of innate immunity by focusing on the role of ACE2 expression and viral infections in children in modulating the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Articles deemed potentially eligible were considered, including those dealing with COVID-19 in children and providing more up-to-date and significant data in terms of epidemiology, prognosis, course, and symptoms, focusing on the etiopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 disease in children. The bibliographic search was conducted using the search engines PubMed and Scopus. The following search terms were entered in PubMed and Scopus: COVID-19 AND ACE2 AND Children; COVID-19 AND Immunity innate AND children. The search identified 857 records, and 18 studies were applicable based on inclusion and exclusion criteria that addressed the issues of COVID-19 concerning the role of ACE2 expression in children. The scientific literature agrees that children develop milder COVID-19 disease than adults. Milder symptomatology could be attributed to innate immunity or previous CovH virus infections, while it is not yet fully understood how the differential expression of ACE2 in children could contribute to milder disease.","Dioguardi, Mario; Cazzolla, Angela Pia; Arena, Claudia; Sovereto, Diego; Caloro, Giorgia Apollonia; Dioguardi, Antonio; Crincoli, Vito; Laino, Luigi; Troiano, Giuseppe; Lo Muzio, Lorenzo",Pediatr Rep,https://doi.org/10.3390/pediatric13030045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34287338/,585

We identified 79 telemedicine-related legislations from the federal government (laws, decrees, and ordinances) and 31 regulations of federal councils of health professionals. Three historical phases were established according to the public policy cycle, and material was classified according to the purpose of the normative documents. The content analysis was based on the advocacy coalition framework model. Of the federal legislations, 8.9% were for the Formulation/Decision-Making phase, 43% for the Organization/Implementation phase, and 48.1% for the Expansion/Maturation phase of telemedicine policy in Brazil. The Federal Council of Medicine was the most active in standardizing telemedicine and was responsible for 21 (67.7%) regulations. The first legislations were passed in 2000; however, the coalitions discussed topics related to telemedicine and created their belief systems from the 1990’s. The time cycle which included formulation and decision making for Brazilian telemedicine policy, extended until 2007 with the creation of several technical working groups. The expansion and maturation of telemedicine services began in 2011 with the decentralization of telemedicine policy actions across the country. Telemedicine centers which performed telediagnosis influenced the computerization of primary health care units. We conclude that Brazilian telemedicine field has greatly grown and changed in recent years. However, despite the proliferation of legislations and regulations in the period studied, there is still no fully consolidated process for setting up a wholly defined regulatory framework for telemedicine in Brazil.","Silva, Angélica Baptista; da Silva, Rondineli Mendes; Ribeiro, Gizele da Rocha; Guedes, Ana Cristina Carneiro Menezes; Santos, Daniela Lacerda; Nepomuceno, Carla Cardi; Caetano, Rosângela",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242869; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33237947/,585

We conducted a primary survey of 521 adults on April 1-10, 2020 in Iran, where the official infection rate was 0.08%. In our sample, 3% reported being COVID-19 positive and 15% were unsure of their status. This relatively high positive rate enabled us to conduct the analysis at the 5% significance level. At the time of the survey, 44% of the adults worked from home; 26% still went to work in their workplaces; 27% had stopped working due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and 3% were unemployed. Adults who exercised more were more likely to be COVID-19 negative. Each additional hour of exercise per day predicted a 78% increase in the likelihood of being COVID-19 negative. Adults with chronic medical illnesses were 48% more likely to be COVID-19 negative. In terms of work situation, those who worked from home were the most likely to be COVID-19 negative, and those who had stopped working were the most likely to be COVID-19 positive. Individuals in larger organizations were less likely to be COVID-19 positive. Given the testing shortage in many countries, we identify a novel approach to predict the likelihood of COVID-19 infection by a set of personal and work situation characteristics, in order to help to identify individuals with more or less risk of contracting the virus. We hope this research opens a new research avenue to identify the individual risk factors of COVID-19 infection to enable more targeted infectious disease prevention, communication, testing, and control to complement the effort to expand testing capacity.","Zhang, S.

A panel of N (⪢1) reagents called X(j), with j=1 to N, is used. The binding strength of each of the X(j) reagents to each other is measured, for example by an ELISA assay, giving an N×N matrix K. The matrix K is used to define another set of N reagents called Y(j), with j=1 to N, each of which is a linear combination of the X(j) reagents and each of which is tailored to be complementary to one of the X(j) reagents. Each of the N pairs of reagents X(j) and Y(j) defines an axis in an N-dimensional shape space. The definition of these axes facilitates proteomic analysis of diverse biological samples, for example, mixtures of proteins such as serum samples or T cell extracts. A method for defining and measuring similarity between pairs of biological samples and between sets of biological samples in the context of the set of N reagent pairs is described.

Since this is a species of conservation concern due to its critical demography in the southernmost population of the Iberian Peninsula, the impacts of infectious diseases, including sarcoptic mange, should be considered during disease surveillance programs of the species’ populations. ABSTRACT: Sarcoptic mange caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei is a worldwide-distributed skin infestation with a wide range of hosts, among them several species within the Felidae family. Sarcoptes scabiei was diagnosed in a dead adult female European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris) from Spain, based on histological evaluation of skin biopsies and identification of the arthropod from skin scrapings and molecular methods. This is the first description of Sarcoptes scabiei in a European wildcat. Due to its critical demography in the southernmost population of the Iberian Peninsula, the impacts of infectious diseases, including sarcoptic mange, as a new potential threat should be considered during disease surveillance programs of the species’ populations.","Nájera, Fernando; Crespo, Elena; García-Talens, Amalia; Grande-Gómez, Rebeca; Herrera-Sánchez, Francisco Javier; Gentil, Michaela; Cortés-García, Carmen; Müller, Elisabeth; Calero-Bernal, Rafael; Revuelta, Luis",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34573459/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11092494,585

METHODS: Epidemiological data were obtained from the public health department of the Thi-Qar Health Office (2015-2020). Eighty stool samples were also randomly collected from patients ≤12 year of age with diarrhea at 2 hospitals between the beginning of February 2020 and the end of October 2020. These samples were selected after microscopy to identify the 18S rRNA gene in Entamoeba DNA. RESULTS: Of the 341,554 cases of intestinal parasitic infections, 38,004 (11.1%) individuals were recorded as having amoebiasis, which accounted for the highest proportion of infections in 2015 (26.1%) and the lowest in 2020 (8.1%). Amoebiasis was distributed among all age groups, with the age group of 5-14 years accounting for the highest proportion (27.3%). In molecular testing, 42 (52.5%) out of 80 samples were positive for the 18S rRNA gene (888 bp). Using nested PCR, E. histolytica (439 bp) was detected in 25 (31.3%) samples and E. dispar (174 bp) in 14 (17.5%), while using real-time PCR, E. histolytica and E. dispar were detected in 28 (35.0%) and 15 (18.8%) samples, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological data confirmed that amoebiasis is endemic in this province, and is not limited to certain months. Our study confirms the applicability of molecular identification to detect pathogenic and non-pathogenic Entamoeba to prescribe the appropriate drug.","Flaih, Mohammed Hassan; Khazaal, Ruaa Majid; Kadhim, Manar Karem; Hussein, Khwam Reissan; Alhamadani, Falah Abd Bashir",Epidemiol Health,https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2021034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33971701/,585

It achieves cell adhesion through dimerization of the N-terminal IgV domain. The crystal structure of the N-terminal dimerization domain of CEACAM has been determined at 1.47 Å resolution. The overall fold of CEACAM7 is similar to those of CEACAM1 and CEACAM5; however, there are differences, the most notable of which is an insertion that causes the C′′ strand to buckle, leading to the creation of a hydrogen bond in the dimerization interface. The K (dimerization) for CEACAM7 determined by sedimentation equilibrium is tenfold tighter than that measured for CEACAM5. These findings suggest that the dimerization affinities of CEACAMs are modulated via sequence variation in the dimerization surface.","Bonsor, Daniel A.; Beckett, Dorothy; Sundberg, Eric J.",Acta Crystallographica Section F Structural Biology Communications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26323304/; http://journals.iucr.org/f/issues/2015/09/00/wd5252/wd5252.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1107/s2053230x15013576,585

Our testing strategy used flow injection tandem mass spectrometry for the first-tier analysis of LPCs, and second-tier quantification of C26:0 LPC using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. There were 364 specimens considered abnormal using our first-tier algorithm that relied on the four LPC measurements and post-analytical tools. Second-tier test results were reported as normal or abnormal based on a cutoff for the single analyte, C26:0 LPC. Eleven cases were reported as abnormal based on second-tier test results. One male with ALD was identified, and two females with peroxisomal biogenesis disorders were also identified. A single female case remains unresolved, due to a loss to follow up after a negative molecular test result for ABCD1 gene sequencing. The positive predictive value for confirmed, clinically relevant disorders during this pilot study was 27.3%. Challenges identified during the study period were based around coverage for confirmatory testing, particularly if family members needed molecular testing, which is an ongoing issue with newborn screening in Georgia. We also encountered issues with the follow up for a patient who remained asymptomatic. Due to the different timelines involved with clinical findings in ALD, follow-up coordination may be more difficult, particularly if the child identified by newborn screening (NBS) is the only member of the family affected, or able to be tested.","Hall, Patricia L.; Li, Hong; Hagar, Arthur F.; Jerris, S.

This study: (1) describes the viral etiology of respiratory illness by prospectively collecting weekly symptom diaries and nasal swabs from families for 1 year, (2) analyzed data by reported symptoms, virus, age, and family composition, and (3) evaluated the duration of virus detection. Methods. Twenty-six households (108 individuals) provided concurrent symptom and nasal swab data for 4166 person-weeks. The FilmArray polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform (BioFire Diagnostics, LLC) was used to detect 16 respiratory viruses. Viral illnesses were defined as ≥1 consecutive weeks with the same virus detected with symptoms reported in ≥1 week. Results. Participants reported symptoms in 23% and a virus was detected in 26% of person-weeks. Children younger than 5 years reported symptoms more often and were more likely to have a virus detected than older participants (odds ratio [OR] 2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.08–2.94 and OR 3.96, 95% CI, 3.35–4.70, respectively). Compared with single person households, individuals living with children experienced 3 additional weeks of virus detection. There were 783 viral detection episodes; 440 (56%) associated with symptoms. Coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, and influenza A detections were usually symptomatic; bocavirus and rhinovirus detections were often asymptomatic. The mean duration of PCR detection was ≤2 weeks for all viruses and detections of ≥3 weeks occurred in 16% of episodes. Younger children had longer durations of PCR detection. Conclusions. Viral detection is often asymptomatic and occasionally prolonged, especially for bocavirus and rhinovirus. In clinical settings, the interpretation of positive PCR tests, particularly in young children and those who live with them, may be confounded.","Byington, Carrie L.; Ampofo, Krow; Stockmann, Chris; Adler, Frederick R.; Herbener, Amy; Miller, Trent; Sheng, Xiaoming; Blaschke, Anne J.; Crisp, Robert; Pavia, Andrew T.",Clinical Infectious Diseases,https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/61/8/1217/16787458/civ486.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26245665/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/civ486,585

650308,Telepsychiatry in the Post-COVID-19 Era: Moving Backwards or Forwards?,2020-08-27,"Background: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created an alarming situation due to extensive loss of human lives and economy, posing enormous threat to global health security. Till date, no antiviral drug or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 has reached the market, although a number of clinical trials are under way. The viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CL(pro)), playing pivotal roles in coronavirus replication and polyprotein processing, is essential for its life cycle. In fact, 3CL(pro) is already a proven drug discovery target for SARS- and MERS-CoVs. This underlines the importance of 3CL protease in the design of potent drugs against COVID-19. Methods: We have collected one hundred twenty-seven relevant literatures to prepare the review article. PubMed, Google Scholar and other scientific search engines were used to collect the literature based on keywords, like “SARS-CoVs-3CL protease,” “medicinal plant and anti-SARS-CoVs-3CL protease” published during 2003–2020. However, earlier publications related to this topic are also cited for necessary illustration and discussion. Repetitive articles and non-English studies were excluded. Results: From the literature search, we have enlisted medicinal plants reported to inhibit coronavirus 3CL protease. Some of the plants like Isatis tinctoria L. (syn. Isatis indigotica Fort.), Torreya nucifera (L.) Siebold and Zucc., Psoralea corylifolia L., and Rheum palmatum L. have exhibited strong anti-3CL(pro) activity. We have also discussed about the phytochemicals with encouraging antiviral activity, such as, bavachinin, psoralidin, betulinic acid, curcumin and hinokinin, isolated from traditional medicinal plants. Conclusion: Currently, searching for a plant-derived novel drug with better therapeutic index is highly desirable due to lack of specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2. It is expected that in-depth evaluation of medicinally important plants would reveal new molecules with significant potential to inhibit coronavirus 3CL protease for development into approved antiviral drug against COVID-19 in future.","Mandal, Anirban; Jha, Ajeet Kumar; Hazra, Banasri",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33767619/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.583387,585
650455,Adaptive systems for student resilience in the context of COVID-19.,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND: Rates of smoking among those with serious mental illness (SMI) are two to three times higher than for the general population. Smoking is rarely addressed in mental health settings. Innovative outreach and treatment strategies are needed to address these disparities. The current study is a pilot study of the feasibility and acceptability of a chronic care model of tobacco cessation treatment implemented in outpatient psychiatry clinics. METHODS: Participants were recruited from two outpatient psychiatric clinics and randomly assigned to intervention (counseling and nicotine replacement for 8 weeks, plus ongoing proactive outreach calls inviting reengagement in treatment) or control (brief education and referral to the state quit line). Assessments were conducted at 8 weeks (end of initial treatment block) and 6 months (end of window for retreatment). Feasibility was assessed by enrollment rate, treatment engagement, and completion of follow-up assessments. Acceptability was assessed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Preliminary efficacy was assessed by 7-day and 30-day abstinence rates, rate of quit attempts, and cigarettes per day. Psychological health was measured to assess for changes related to treatment group or attempts to quit smoking. RESULTS: Nineteen participants were randomized to intervention and 19 to control. Recruitment proved feasible, and high rates of treatment engagement (mean of 4.5 sessions completed in initial treatment block, 89.5% uptake of nicotine replacement) and retention (94.7% of follow-up assessments completed) were observed. Treatment acceptability was high. As anticipated, there were no significant differences in abstinence between groups, but results generally favored the intervention group, including bio-verified 7-day abstinence rates of 21.1% in intervention vs. 17.6% in control and self-reported 30-day abstinence rates of 16.1% in intervention vs. 5.1% in control at 8 weeks. Significantly more intervention participants made at least one quit attempt (94.7% vs 52.6%; OR = 16.20, 95% CI: 1.79–147.01). Cigarettes per day decreased significantly more in the intervention group at 8 weeks (b = − 13.19, SE = 4.88, p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: It was feasible to recruit and retain SMI patients in a smoking cessation trial in the context of outpatient psychiatry. The novel chronic care model treatment was acceptable to patients and showed promise for efficacy. If efficacious, a chronic care model could be effective at reducing smoking among SMI patients.

Currently, there are limited epidemiological and clinical data on COVID-19 patients from low and middle-income countries. We conducted a retrospective single-center study of the first 100 individuals with suspected COVID-19 (between Jan. 25 and Mar. 29, 2020) admitted to San Lazaro Hospital (SLH), the national infectious diseases referral hospital in Manila, Philippines. RESULTS: Demographic data, travel history, clinical features, and outcomes were summarized and compared between COVID-19 confirmed and non-confirmed cases. The first two confirmed cases were Chinese nationals, admitted on Jan. 25. The third confirmed case was a Filipino, admitted on Mar. 8. Trends toward confirmed COVID-19 cases not reporting international travel and being admitted to SLH from the densely populated area of Manila city were observed during Mar. 8-29. All 42 of the 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases were adults, 40% were aged 60 years and above and 55% were male. Three were health workers. Among individuals with suspected COVID-19, confirmed cases were more likely to be older, Filipino, not report international travel history and have at least one underlying disease, particularly diabetes, report difficulty in breathing, and a longer duration of symptoms. In over 90% of non-COVID-19 cases, the alternative diagnosis was respiratory. Nine (21%) confirmed cases died. The median duration from symptoms onset to death was 11.5 (range: 8–18) days. CONCLUSIONS: Imported COVID-19 cases have reduced but local transmission persists and there is a trend toward cases being admitted to SLH from densely populated areas. This study highlights the difficulty in diagnosing COVID-19 on clinical grounds and the importance of diagnostic capacity in all settings. Difficulty of breathing was the only symptom associated with COVID-19 infection and should alert clinicians to the possibility of COVID-19. Clinical characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 cases and a hospital case fatality rate of 21% are comparable with other settings.","Salva, Eumelia P.; Villarama, Jose Benito; Lopez, Edmundo B.; Sayo, Ana Ria; Villanueva, Annavi Marie G.; Edwards, Tansy; Han, Su Myat; Suzuki, Shuichi; Seposo, Xerxes; Ariyoshi, Koya; Smith, Chris",Trop Med Health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41182-020-00241-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32577087/,585

Data for the first phase was gathered during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis in Israel (T1), which included the overall lock-down of the Israeli society. The repeated measurement was conducted approximately two months later, on the initial phase of lifting the lock-down (T2). The sample size was 300 people. Results indicated four significant differences between the first and the second measurements: Sense of danger, distress symptoms, and national resilience significantly decreased, while perceived well-being increased at T2. No significant differences were noted between the two measurements regarding individual and community resilience and economic difficulties. The data indicated that the highest decrease in national resilience was accounted for by low respondent trust in governmental decisions during the COVID-19 crisis. The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the participants was determined by two indicators: level of distress symptoms and sense of danger. Path analyses showed that five variables significantly predicted these two indicators. Their best predictor at T1 and T2 was well-being followed by individual resilience, economic difficulties due to the pandemic crisis, community resilience, and gender. It was concluded that psychological attributes may help in decreasing the impact of the threats of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kimhi, Shaul; Marciano, Hadas; Eshel, Yohanan; Adini, Bruria",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212420920313455; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420920313455?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101843; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32953439/,585

The aim of this study is to investigate if some health indicators might have been useful to understand the capacity of Italian National Health Service to manage the COVID 19 epidemic. We will compare data in two different Italian regions in the Northern part of Italy (Lombardy and Veneto) with the national data to understand if different health strategies might be significant to explain different patterns of COVID 19 epidemic in Italy. The two regions have two different health policies to face CoViD-2019 epidemic. To face epidemic like this one the answer should be outside hospitals but this means to have general practitioners well-trained and enough healthcare personnel working outside hospitals.","Castaldi, S.; Luconi, E.; Rivieccio, B.

Avoiding these spaces is one of the most effective ways to slow the spread. This study assessed who had engaged in risky travel and leisure behaviors before the availability of vaccines. DESIGN: National cross-sectional on-line survey collected in November and December 2020. Setting: United States; Participants: 2589 adults representative by gender and race/ethnicity to the US population; Measures: The survey assessed if people had resumed 11 risky behaviors during the pandemic, prior to vaccines. Independent variables included age, race/ethnicity, region of the country, education, income, preexisting conditions, perceived severity and susceptibility, positive COVID diagnosis, and political ideology. ANALYSIS: Univariate analysis and logistic regressions were used to assess demographic and psychological factors of those resuming these behaviors. Results: Most (60.3%) of people had resumed at least 1 behavior with eating inside of restaurants (33.2%) and visiting family and friends (37.5%) being the most prevalent. In the multivariate analyses, perceived susceptibility was significant across all behaviors. Young people, fiscal conservatives, and people with higher perceived severity were more likely to perform several of the behaviors. Preexisting conditions did not predict any of the behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Travel and leisure behaviors vary by type of risk and may need specific tailored, prevention messages to promote risk reduction during future pandemics.","Maddock, Jay E.; Suess, Courtney",Inquiry,https://doi.org/10.1177/00469580211048673; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34605280/,585

Appropriate animal models are essential for testing of vaccines and therapeutics and for mechanistic studies of infection and the host response. The Spike (S) protein of SARS-COV-2 has a high affinity for the human ACE2 receptor, which is expressed on multiple cell types including alveolar epithelial and vascular endothelial cells. Wild-type mice are not susceptible to developing coronavirus-mediated diseases. Accordingly, several human (h)ACE2 transgenic mouse models have been developed for coronavirus research. However, these mice have failed to closely mimic important aspects of the human immunopathological responses to SARS-CoV-2. We report herein that DRAGA (HLA-A2.HLA-DR4.Rag1KO.IL-2Rγc KO.NOD) mice infused with human hematopoietic stem cells from cord blood reconstitute a fully functional human immune system, as well as engraft human epithelial and endothelial cells, sustain SARS-CoV-2 infection, and develop severe COVID-19-like symptoms. In pilot experiments, infected mice developed parenchymal and epithelial lung infiltrations with granzyme B(+) and perforin(+) CD8(+) T cells and alveolar CD61(+) microthrombi, mimicking human immunopathological responses to SARS-CoV-2. We propose the DRAGA mouse as a novel pre-clinical tool for studying COVID-19 immunopathology and human immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, including events leading to the cytokine storm and coagulopathies, as well as for testing of candidate vaccines and therapeutics.","Brumeanu, Teodor-D; Vir, Pooja; Shashikumar, Soumya; Karim, Ahmad Faisal; Kar, Swagata; Chung, Kevin K.; Pratt, Kathleen P.; Casares, Sofia",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.19.251249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839773/,585

For the second half of the semester, animal physiology was taught exclusively over Zoom. Here we describe how a flipped teaching format that was used before the pandemic eased the transition from face-to-face teaching to online instruction. The preclass preparation resources and the active learning materials that were already in place for flipped teaching were helpful in the transition to solely online teaching. Therefore, the focus during the transition was to reconfigure active learning and examinations from the face-to-face format to the online platform. Instead of small group discussions in the classroom, teams interacted in Zoom Breakout Rooms. Rather than taking exams in-person during scheduled class time, students submitted exams online. Additionally, students prerecorded their project presentations instead of presenting them “live” during the last week of classes. Overall, students felt that the class smoothly transitioned to a remote only format. These and other changes to the instructional methods will be implemented during the Spring 2021 semester when the course is taught fully online.","Beason-Abmayr, Beth; Caprette, David R.; Gopalan, Chaya",Adv Physiol Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33961513/; https://doi.org/10.1152/advan.00248.2020,585
656445,Google Trend Analysis and Paradigm Shift of Online Education Platforms during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-05-12,"Widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing is highly valuable for identifying asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic individuals to slow community disease transmission. However, there remains a technological gap for highly reliable, easy, and quick SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests that are suitable for frequent mass testing. Compared to the conventional nasopharyngeal (NP) swab-based tests, saliva-based methods are attractive due to easier and safer sampling protocols. Despite its merits in rapid turn-around-time and high throughput compared to traditional PCR-based technologies, the widespread use of saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests is hindered by limited analytical sensitivity of current methods. Here, we report the first ultrasensitive, saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen assay with an analytical sensitivity of < 0.32 pg/ml, corresponding to 4 viral RNA copies/ul, which is comparable to that of PCR-based tests. Using the novel electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based S-PLEX immunoassay, we measured the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) antigen concentration in 105 saliva samples obtained from non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 patients. Our assay displayed absolute specificity and high sensitivity (90.2%), where it correctly identified samples with viral loads up to 35 CT cycles by saliva-based PCR. Paired NP swab-based PCR results were also obtained for 86 cases for comparison. Our assay showed high concordance with saliva-based and NP swab-based PCR in samples with negative (< 0.32 pg/ml) and strongly positive (> 2 pg/ml) N antigen concentrations. Our study unveiled the ultrasensitivity and specificity of the saliva-based S-PLEX assay, demonstrating its clinical value as a high throughput, complementary alternative to PCR-based techniques. The novel technique is especially valuable in cases where compliance to frequent swabbing may be problematic (e.g. schools, nursing homes, etc.).","Ren, A.; Sohaei, D.; Zacharioudakis, I.; Sigal, G.

Concerning the absence of an approved effective vaccine or drug for the treatment and outcome improvement of COVID-19 patients, and the role of SARS-CoV-2 in activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, we decided to review the previous data regarding the therapeutic effect of mTOR inhibitor drugs in COVID-19 patients. We searched the scientific databases such as Web of Science, Embase, Medline (PubMed), Scopus, and Google Scholar using appropriate keywords to find suitable studies or suggestions until October 2020. The findings of the current study confirmed that mTOR inhibitor drugs through suggested mechanisms such as T cell adjustment, induction of autophagy without apoptosis, reduction of viral replication, restoration of the T-cell function, decrease cytokine storm, and moderation of the mTOR-PI3K-AKT pathway activation bring about a therapeutic impact in COVID-19 patients. Taken together, it is necessary to find a suitable therapy for the COVID-19 pandemic emerging. In this regard, we clarify that it is valuable to consider the therapeutic effect of mTOR inhibitor drugs and metformin by its mTOR inhibition property in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Mashayekhi-Sardoo, Habibeh; Hosseinjani, Hesamoddin",Journal of basic and clinical physiology and pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1515/jbcpp-2020-0495; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34218545/,585

COVID-19 is only the latest case of betacoronavirus (β-CoV) epidemics/pandemics. In the last 20 years, two deadly CoV epidemics, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS; fatality rate 9.6%) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS; fatality rate 34.7%), plus the emergence of HCoV-HKU1 which causes the winter common cold (fatality rate 0.5%), were already a source of public health concern. Betacoronaviruses can also be a threat for livestock, as evidenced by the Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome (SADS) epizootic in pigs. These repeated outbreaks of β-CoV-induced diseases raise the question of the dynamic of propagation of this group of viruses in wildlife and human ecosystems. SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and HCoV-HKU1 emerged in Asia, strongly suggesting the existence of a regional hot spot for emergence. However, there might be other regional hot spots, as seen with MERS-CoV, which emerged in the Arabian Peninsula. β-CoVs responsible for human respiratory infections are closely related to bat-borne viruses. Bats are present worldwide and their level of infection with CoVs is very high on all continents. However, there is as yet no evidence of direct bat-to-human coronavirus infection. Transmission of β-CoV to humans is considered to occur accidentally through contact with susceptible intermediate animal species. This zoonotic emergence is a complex process involving not only bats, wildlife and natural ecosystems, but also many anthropogenic and societal aspects. Here, we try to understand why only few hot spots of β-CoV emergence have been identified despite worldwide bats and bat-borne β-CoV distribution. In this work, we analyze and compare the natural and anthropogenic environments associated with the emergence of β-CoV and outline conserved features likely to create favorable conditions for a new epidemic. We suggest monitoring South and East Africa as well as South America as these regions bring together many of the conditions that could make them future hot spots.","Frutos, Roger; Serra-Cobo, Jordi; Pinault, Lucile; Lopez Roig, Marc; Devaux, Christian A.",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33790874/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.591535,585

First emerging in China, it has spread rapidly across the globe, giving rise to significant social and economic costs and imposing severe strain on healthcare systems. Since many attempts to control viral spread has been futile, the only old practice of containment including city lockdown and social distancing are working to some extent. Unfortunately, specific antiviral drugs and vaccines remain unavailable yet. Many factors are encountered to play essential roles in viral pathogenesis. These include a broad viral-host range with high receptor binding affinity to various human tissues, viral adaptation to humans, a high percentage of asymptomatic but infected carriers, prolonged incubation, and viral shedding periods. There are also a wide variety of pulmonary and extrapul-monary tissue damage mechanisms including direct cell injury or immune-mediated damages involving the immune cells, upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, and antibody dependent enhancement that can result in multi-organ failure. In this article, we summarise some evidence on the various steps in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and immune evasion strategies to assess their contribution to our understanding of unresolved problems related to SARS-CoV-2 prevention, control, and treatment protocols.","Abdullah, Shatha F.; Sharquie, Inas K.",Medeni Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32733765/; https://doi.org/10.5222/mmj.2020.82584,585

METHODS The annual burden of diseases from 2008 to 2020 in Japan were calculated with the incidence- and pathogen-based approach for the 15 VPDs (hepatitis B virus infection, human papillomavirus (HPV), influenza, invasive pneumococcal disease, invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease, invasive meningococcal disease, Japanese encephalitis, measles, mumps, pertussis, rotavirus, rubella, tetanus, tuberculosis and varicella), using disability-adjusted life year (DALY). RESULTS The average annual burden between 2008 and 2020 is the highest in influenza (114,129 DALY/year), followed by HPV infection, hepatitis B virus infection, tuberculosis and mumps (109,782, 69,883, 23,855 and 5693 DALY/year). In the pre-COVID-19 period (2008-2019), the decreasing trend of burden was observed in hepatitis B virus infection, invasive pneumococcal disease, invasive Hib disease, tuberculosis and varicella. HPV infection is the only VPD which had more than 100,000 DALY/year for all years during the study period. In 2020, the estimated annual burdens are decreased in influenza (71%), invasive pneumococcal disease (51%), invasive Hib diseases (54%), invasive meningococcal disease (64%), measles (98%), mumps (47%) pertussis (83%), rotavirus infection (95%), rubella (94%) and varicella (35%) compared with those in 2019. CONCLUSIONS The study demonstrated decreasing trends of burdens for some VPDs, while a persistently high burden has been observed for other VPDs, including HPV infection.

It is uncertain how best to communicate these collateral findings to patients. OBJECTIVES: To determine how reactions to a letter communicating collateral findings relate to who signed the letter, the type of finding, or whether the letter specified that the finding arose from a pragmatic clinical trial. RESEARCH DESIGN: Web-based survey experiment using a between-subjects design in which respondents were randomly assigned within education strata to view and respond to 1 of 16 hypothetical scenarios. SUBJECTS: Adults recruited from an online panel constructed from a probability sample of US-based postal addresses. MEASURES: The primary outcomes were the action the respondent would take next (i.e., contact a doctor immediately or something else) and the respondent’s emotional reactions (i.e., all positive, all negative, mixed, or none). RESULTS: A total of 4080 respondents had analyzable data. Although some effects were statistically significant (P < .05), none exceeded a prespecified threshold for policy relevance (15 or more percentage points). Ratings of letter clarity and level of understanding were lower for letters that included a description of the clinical trial. CONCLUSIONS: Signatory and level of detail about collateral findings did not substantially affect people’s intentions to take the recommended action of contacting their doctor.

This study adapted Respondent Driven Sampling, a peer-driven recruitment method, to a digital platform (d-RDS) and evaluated its utility to recruit community-dwelling emerging adult (EA) risky drinkers, who are under-served and more difficult to reach for assessment and intervention than their college student peers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Community-dwelling EA risky drinkers (N = 357) were recruited using d-RDS (M age = 23.6 years, 64.0% women). Peers recruited peers in an iterative fashion. Participants completed a web-based cross-sectional survey of drinking practices and problems and associated risk and protective factors. RESULTS: d-RDS successfully recruited EA risky drinkers. On average, the sample reported recent drinking exceeding low-risk drinking guidelines and 8.80 negative consequences in the past three months. Compared to age-matched respondents from the representative U.S. National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the sample reported more past month drinking days and more drinks consumed per drinking day (ps < .001). At higher consumption levels, predicted positive associations were found with lower education and receipt of public assistance.

Several immunochromatography kits of the antibody for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been developed, but it is still unclear which kits have high diagnostic value. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy rate for antibody detection of each immunochromatography kit and reveal which kit has a high diagnostic value for antibody detection. METHODS: This study was carried out between 1 August 2020 and 14 October 2020 at the Association of EISEIKAI Medical and Healthcare Corporation Minamitama Hospital. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and approximately 30 days after symptom onset were included as the positive group. The serum SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were analysed using seven immunochromatography kits. RESULTS: Twenty samples (Positive group: 10 patients, Negative group: 10 healthy medical workers) were included in this study. The median age of the patients was 44 years, and the median duration from symptom onset was 30.5 days in the positive group. The accuracy rates for IgM/IgG detection were: 90.0%/100% in Kit A; 50.0%/95.0% in Kit B; 55.0%/65.0% in Kit C; 60.0%/55.0% in Kit D; 50.0%/80.0% in Kit E; 80.0%/90.0% in Kit F; and 90.0%/100% in Kit G. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that there is a variation of accuracy rates between immunochromatography kits for antibodies of SARS-CoV-2.

660832,Answering the Call: Medical Students Reinforce Health System Frontlines Through Ochsner COVID-19 Hotline,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to test the hypothesis that in-hospital respiratory viral infections (RVI) would be significantly lower in a cohort of patients with established bronchopulmonary dysplasia exposed to a SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention protocol when compared to historical controls. STUDY DESIGN: On April 1, 2020, we implemented a universal infection prevention protocol to minimize the risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a dedicated BPD intensive care unit. We performed a retrospective cohort study and included patients with established BPD, as defined by the 2019 Neonatal Research Network criteria, admitted to our center who underwent real-time polymerase-chain-reaction RVI testing between January 1, 2015 and March 31, 2021. We excluded patients re-admitted from home. We compared the proportion of positive tests to the number of tests performed and the distribution of viral respiratory pathogens in the pre- and post-SARS-CoV-2 eras. RESULTS: Among 176 patients included in the study, 663 RVI tests were performed and 172 (26%) tests were positive. The median number of tests performed, measured in tests per patient per month, in the SARS-CoV-2 era was not significantly different compared to the pre-SARS-CoV-2 era (0.45 vs 0.34 tests per patient per month, P = 0.07). The proportion of positive RVI tests was significantly lower in the SARS-CoV-2 era when compared to the pre-SARS-CoV-2 era (0.06 vs 0.30, P<0.0001). No patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the SARS-CoV-2 era. CONCLUSIONS: Infection prevention measures developed in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may reduce the risk of RVIs in hospitalized patients with established BPD.

As part of improving surveillance in the region, the BioCaster project aims to develop a system based on text mining for automatically monitoring Internet news and other online sources in several regional languages. At the heart of the system is an application ontology which serves the dual purpose of enabling advanced searches on the mined facts and of allowing the system to make intelligent inferences for assessing the priority of events. However, it became clear early on in the project that existing classification schemes did not have the necessary language coverage or semantic specificity for our needs.

Increasingly, procedures are performed in more distant, isolated and less familiar locations, challenging anaesthesiologists and requiring well developed situational awareness. This review looks at implications for the practitioner and patient safety, outlining considerations and steps involved in translation of systems and processes well established in the operating room to more unfamiliar environments. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite limited nonoperating room anaesthesia outcome data, analysis of malpractice claims, anaesthesia-related medical disputes and clinical outcome registries have suggested higher morbidity and mortality. Complications were often associated with suboptimal monitoring, nonadherence to recommended guidelines and sedationist or nonanaesthesiologist caregivers. More recently, clear monitoring guidelines, global patient safety initiatives and widespread implementation of cognitive aids may have contributed to nonoperating room anaesthesia (NORA) outcomes approaching that of traditional operating rooms. SUMMARY: As NORA caseloads increase, understanding structural and anaesthetic requirements is essential to patient safety. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has provided an opportunity for anaesthesiologists to implement lessons learned from previous analyses, share expertise as patient safety leaders and provide valuable input into protecting patients and caregivers.","Borshoff, David C.; Sadleir, Paul",Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32628402/; https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000000895,585

We retrospectively assessed the effectiveness and safety of NIPPV in a cohort of COVID-19 patients consecutively admitted to the COVID-19 general wards of a medium-size Italian hospital, from March 6 to May 7, 2020. Healthcare workers (HCWs) caring for COVID-19 patients were monitored, undergoing nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 in case of onset of COVID-19 symptoms, and periodic SARS-CoV-2 screening serology. Overall, 50 patients (mean age 74.6 years) received NIPPV, of which 22 (44%) were successfully weaned, avoiding endotracheal intubation (ETI) and AHRF-related death. Due to limited life expectancy, 25 (50%) of 50 NIPPV-treated patients received a “do not intubate” (DNI) order. Among these, only 6 (24%) were weaned from NIPPV. Of the remaining 25 NIPPV-treated patients without treatment limitations, 16 (64%) were successfully weaned, 9 (36%) underwent delayed ETI and, of these, 3 (33.3%) died. NIPPV success was predicted by the use of corticosteroids (OR 15.4, CI 1.79–132.57, p 0.013) and the increase in the PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio measured 24–48 h after NIPPV initiation (OR 1.02, CI 1–1.03, p 0.015), while it was inversely correlated with the presence of a DNI order (OR 0.03, CI 0.001–0.57, p 0.020). During the study period, 2 of 124 (1.6%) HCWs caring for COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Apart from patients with limited life expectancy, NIPPV was effective in a substantially high percentage of patients with COVID-19-associated AHRF. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs was low.","Faraone, Antonio; Beltrame, Chiara; Crociani, Andrea; Carrai, Paolo; Lovicu, Elena; Filetti, Simona; Sbaragli, Serena; Alessi, Chiara; Cameron Smith, Michela; Angotti, Chiara; Fortini, Alberto",Intern Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-020-02562-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33222116/,585

In contemporary pervasive systems most modern virtual agents have specific reactions when interacting with humans and usually lack extended dialogue and cognitive competences. The presented tool aims to provide natural human-computer multi-modal interaction via exploitation of state-of-the-art technologies in computer vision, speech recognition and synthesis, knowledge representation, sensor data analysis, and by leveraging prior clinical knowledge and patient history through an intelligent, ontology-driven, dialogue manager with reasoning capabilities, which can also access a web search and retrieval engine module. The framework’s main contribution lies in its versatility to combine different technologies, while its inherent capability to monitor patient behaviour allows doctors and caregivers to spend less time collecting patient-related information and focus on healthcare. Moreover, by capitalising on voice, sensor and camera data, it may bolster patients’ confidence levels and encourage them to naturally interact with the virtual agent, drastically improving their moral during a recuperation process.","Mavropoulos, Thanassis; Symeonidis, Spyridon; Tsanousa, Athina; Giannakeris, Panagiotis; Rousi, Maria; Kamateri, Eleni; Meditskos, Georgios; Ioannidis, Konstantinos; Vrochidis, Stefanos; Kompatsiaris, Ioannis",J Intell Inf Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34127879/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10844-021-00648-7,585

The nature and longevity of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not well defined. We charted longitudinal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in 92 subjects after symptomatic COVID-19. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are unimodally distributed over a broad range, with symptom severity correlating directly with virus-specific antibody magnitude. Seventy-six subjects followed longitudinally to ∼100 days demonstrated marked heterogeneity in antibody duration dynamics. Virus-specific IgG decayed substantially in most individuals, whereas a distinct subset had stable or increasing antibody levels in the same timeframe despite similar initial antibody magnitudes. These individuals with increasing responses recovered rapidly from symptomatic COVID-19 disease, harbored increased somatic mutations in virus-specific memory B cell antibody genes, and had persistent higher frequencies of previously activated CD4+ T cells. These findings illuminate an efficient immune phenotype that connects rapid symptom clearance to differential antibody durability dynamics.","Chen, Yuezhou; Zuiani, Adam; Fischinger, Stephanie; Mullur, Jyotsna; Atyeo, Caroline; Travers, Meghan; Lelis, Felipe J.N.; Pullen, Krista M.; Martin, Hannah; Tong, Pei; Gautam, Avneesh; Habibi, Shaghayegh; Bensko, Jillian; Gakpo, Deborah; Feldman, Jared; Hauser, Blake M.; Caradonna, Timothy M.; Cai, Yongfei; Burke, John S.; Lin, Junrui; Lederer, James A.; Lam, Evan Christopher; Lavine, Christy L.; Seaman, Michael S.; Chen, Bing; Schmidt, Aaron G.; Balazs, Alejandro Benjamin; Lauffenburger, Douglas A.; Alter, Galit; Wesemann, Duane R.",Cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.10.051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33171099/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0092867420314586; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420314586?v=s5,585

Countries have set an ambitious health policy agenda for the next 15 years with prioritisation of universal health coverage under the Sustainable Development Goals. The scale of investment needed for equitable access to health services means global health is one of the key economic opportunities for decades to come. New financing partnerships with the private sector are vital. The aim of this study is to unlock additional financing sources, acknowledging the imperative to link financial returns to the providers of capital, and create profitable, sustainable financing structures. This paper outlines the global health investment opportunity exploring intersections of financial and health sector interests, and the role investment in health can play in economic development. Considering increasing demand for impact investments, the paper explores responsible financing initiatives and expansion of the global movement for sustainable capital markets. Adding an explicit health component (H) to the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investment criteria, creating the ESG+H initiative, could serve as catalyst for the inclusion of health criteria into mainstream financial actors’ business practices and investment objectives. The conclusion finds that health considerations directly impact profitability of the firm and therefore should be incorporated into financial analysis. Positive assessment of health impact, at a broad societal or environmental level, as well as for a firm’s employees can become a value enhancing competitive advantage. An ESG+H framework could incorporate this into mainstream financial decision-making and into scalable investment products.","Krech, Rüdiger; Kickbusch, Ilona; Franz, Christian; Wells, Nadya",BMJ Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29736278/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2017-000597,585

In the case of the nursing profession, professional commitment gains greater importance in times of crisis, like the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross‐sectional study was conducted with 389 nurses in the Turkish state hospital. Institutional permissions, ethical approval and written consents from the participants were obtained before carrying out the study. RESULTS: The participants’ mean Perceived Organizational Obstruction Scale score was 20.07 ± 8.06 (min = 5.0, max = 35.0), and their mean Nursing Professional Commitment Scale score was 71.20 ± 11.94 (min = 30.0, max = 103.0). Socio‐demographic variables and perception of organisational obstruction predicted 36.7% of the variance in the professional commitment (p < .001). CONCLUSION: A road map based on the study results was developed for hospitals and nurse managers to maintain and increase nurses' professional commitment.

Using a design thinking approach, we rapidly built, tested, and deployed a solution using simple, out-of-the-box web technology that enables clinicians to access the specific information they seek within moments. This platform has been rapidly adopted throughout the emergency department, with up to 70% of clinicians using the digital tool on any given shift and 78.6% of users reporting that they “agree” or “strongly agree” that the platform has affected their management of COVID-19 patients. The tool has also proven easily adaptable, with multiple protocols being updated nearly 20 times over two months without issue.

Building on my current ethnographic research on COVID-19 using purposive sampling and interview guide in Pakistan, and borrowing from various anthropological concepts such as “social drama,” proposed by Victor Turner, and ritual, I have developed a concept that I call rituals of containment. With this concept, I extend my previous argument regarding “symbolic ownership” to show a visible “body politics” by demonstrating how religion, science, and politics around COVID-19 are entangled at individual and government levels. This has become observable through the rituals of the Pakistani government of containment to deal with COVID-19. Such entanglements are visible in the case of strategies to tackle infected “viral bodies,” as the government has enacted its authority: (1) to bury what I am terming the dead viral body without its beloved ones present; (2) to return or not to return this body to family members in a coffin; (3) or to provide the grieving family with a symbolic empty coffin. These Covidian politics have led to the question: Who in actuality owns the body?

Manufacturers provide lists of the side effects of their products. Adverse reactions are proof of the effectiveness of vaccines and that the immune system is responding. In this study, we compare the side effects of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines. Our survey results show that the side effects of the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine are more common than after the first and second doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Most respondents in our survey reported at least one side-effect after the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccine, but these reactions were less common after the Pfizer preparation. PATIENTS AND METHODS A survey was distributed via the internet. It was conducted among people vaccinated with Pfizer or AstraZeneca. The respondents were asked about the side effects after the first and second doses of the vaccines, such as injection site pain, arm pain, muscle pain, headache, fever, chills, and fatigue. RESULTS The questionnaire was completed by 705 people. 196 of them had been vaccinated with Pfizer and 509 with AstraZeneca. Among those vaccinated with the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, 96.5% reported at least one post-vaccination reaction. 17.1% of respondents reported all the side effects listed in the survey. Among those vaccinated with the first Pfizer dose, vaccine reactions were reported by 93.9% of respondents; 2% of respondents experienced all the side effects mentioned in the survey. The second dose of the Pfizer vaccine caused post-vaccinal reactions in most of the subjects: 54.8% of respondents had more adverse reactions, and 15.8% had fewer adverse reactions than after the first dose of this vaccine; 29.4% experienced the same side effects after the first and second doses of the Pfizer vaccine. CONCLUSIONS Side effects as a result of vaccination are not rare and are proof that the immune system is responding. However, severe adverse reactions to vaccines can be dangerous, and they engender fear. Concerns about the side effects and complications of COVID-19 vaccines may eclipse opinions regarding their benefits. This study shows that the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine causes side effects more often than either dose of the Pfizer vaccine.","Andrzejczak-Grządko, S; Czudy, Z; Donderska, M",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202106_26153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34227078/,585

In this study, we investigated the characteristics of viral shedding from different sites and the neutralizing antibody (NAb) response during the acute and convalescent phases of nine children with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in their nasopharyngeal swabs (9/9, 100%), stool samples (8/9, 89%), and oropharyngeal swabs (3/9, 33%) but was not detected in their serum and urine samples. The median duration of viral shedding detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, and stools was 13, 4, and 43 days respectively, and the maximum duration of viral shedding detected from stools was 46 days after discharge. In children, nasopharyngeal swabs appear to be a more sensitive specimen type for the diagnosis of COVID-19 compared with oropharyngeal swabs. Three of eight patients produced NAbs in the acute phase, and NAbs were detected in all eight patients with convalescent sera. The results of this study provide valuable information for the diagnosis and surveillance of COVID-19 and development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for use in children.","Liu, Pengcheng; Cai, Jiehao; Jia, Ran; Xia, Shuai; Wang, Xiangshi; Cao, Lingfeng; Zeng, Mei; Xu, Jin",Emerging microbes & infections,https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1772677; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32515685/,585

Our objective is to prevent and mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at an institutional level, while reducing the risk of infection among both physicians and patients in the context of a critical scenario in the local and Latin American healthcare system. METHODS: SAMeR Executive Committee set up a crisis committee which was made up of specialists in reproductive medicine, embryology, and healthcare management. A critical and updated review of the advances in science, documents, and recommendations released by other societies (ASRM, ESHRE, IFFS, Red LARA, societies of anesthesiologists, infectious diseases, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration—OSHA) was carried out. Likewise, there were joint meetings with the Ministry of Health of Argentina in order to draw up the guidelines. Simultaneously, ongoing medical training was carried out, thus providing added value to them, including two status surveys of the activities of the monovalent and polyvalent centers according to the country’s epidemiological mapping. Four additional recommendations were made, and online training was given to healthcare workers. The aforementioned regulations were first analyzed by the healthcare providers and their practical suggestions were then added to the guidelines. RESULTS: The one-off collaborative work and the actions coordinated with the National ART Program of the Ministry of Health of Argentina resulted in the development and implementation of the present COVID-19 Risk Assessment and Safety Management Operational Guidelines at a national level. SAMeR gave recommendations for the implementation of the Management Guidelines for the center reopening, providing new safety criteria against the threat of viral contagion. A new organizational culture was promoted through the awareness of all the healthcare workers and teaching responsibility. We continue working on the compliance with a new “Code of Conduct and Commitment in Healthcare” and with workplace safety measures. We helped with transforming the theoretical knowledge into practical measures for the healthcare workers in different services, with the aim to prevent, mitigate, and/or handle contingencies at the centers/services and gamete banks, in line with the actions agreed upon with the Ministry of Health. CONCLUSIONS: As an extraordinary and uncertain event, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic helped consolidate a volunteer-based and collaborative panel of SAMeR experts who developed the COVID-19 Risk Assessment and Safety Management Operational Guidelines as a new and readily available tool for physicians, patients, and gamete banks care. Their implementation has provided specific guidelines to minimize risk for professionals in ART clinics, as well as guaranteeing patient safety.

We have followed time course of emerging viral mutants and variants during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in ten countries. We examined complete SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences in GISAID with sampling extending until January 20, 2021. These sequences originated from ten different countries: United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, USA, India, Russia, France, Spain, Germany, and China. Among the novel mutations, some previously reported mutations waned and some of them increased over time. VUI2012/01 (B.1.1.7) and 501Y.V2 (B.1.351), the UK and South Africa variants, respectively, and two variants from Brazil, 484K.V2, P.1 and P.2, increased in prevalence. Despite lockdowns, worldwide active replication in genetically and socio-economically diverse populations facilitated selection of new mutations. The data on mutant and variant SARS-CoV-2 strains provided here comprise a global resource for easy access to the myriad mutations and variants detected to date globally. Rapidly evolving new variant and mutant strains might give rise to escape variants, capable of limiting the efficacy of vaccines, therapies, and diagnostic tests.","Weber, S.; Ramirez, C. C.

Real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in nasopharyngeal aspirates revealed HCoV infection in 79 cases (3.8%): 33 HCoV‐229E (1.6%), 13 HCoV‐NL63 (0.6%), 11 HCoV‐OC43 (0.5%), none HCoV‐HKU1 genotype A, and 22 (1.1%) co‐detections of a HCoV and another respiratory virus. The HCoVs were identified mainly in children with upper respiratory tract infection; there was no significant difference in clinical presentation between single HCoV infections and HCoV co‐infections. Diagnostic methods were used in a limited number of patients, and the therapy prescribed and clinical outcomes were similar regardless of the viral strain. There were a few cases of other members of the households of HCoV‐positive children falling ill during the 5–7 days following enrollment. These findings suggest that HCoV‐229E and HCoV‐OC43 have a limited clinical and socioeconomic impact on otherwise healthy children and their household contacts, and the HCoV‐NL63 identified recently does not seem to be any different.

While these measures are critical for saving the lives of thousands, they may be sources of stress for individuals managing a chronic disease or make disease management more challenging. Forty-five percent of Americans live with chronic disease and already manage a range of everyday stressors related to their disease, making the additional stress produced by this public health guidance and their messages more difficult. Guided by Cohen and colleagues’ Stage Model of Stress and Disease [16] and Ryan and Sawin’s Individual and Family Self-Management Theory [17], this paper identifies the various dimensions of these public health measures that may cause stress and negatively impact individuals managing chronic disease. Further, this paper presents a conceptual model for understanding how these stressors and common stressors associated with managing chronic disease interact and significantly impact chronic disease management. Considering the impact of these stressors on individuals managing chronic disease is paramount to ensure this population is empowered to manage this additional stress healthily and effectively. Recommendations for individuals managing chronic disease and health care professionals working with this population are provided.","Coupet, Sidney; Nicolas, Guerda; Louder, Ceewin N.; Meyer, Marisol",Social sciences & humanities open,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590291121000462; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssaho.2021.100150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33880443/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590291121000462?v=s5,585

The purpose of this review is to highlight the possible ocular presentation of COVID-19 infection and the consequence of the pandemic in the daily ophthalmology routine. A total of 9 articles was included by searching PubMed database for articles published between December 2019 and April 2020. MAIN BODY: Conjunctivitis (and keratoconjunctivitis) can be the first symptom in infected patients. The virus can be present in tear and conjunctival secretions, requiring maximum attention. It’s important to understand if COVID-19 could spread through the ocular route or present as the primary infected site. Ocular implications should also be considered for therapy. In fact, one potential treatment is chloroquine and its derivatives, including hydroxychloroquine. Hydroxychloroquine, in fact, can induced retinal toxicity. The exponential increase in lthe number of Covid-19 cases was like a tsunami for health care companies, which were not ready to face this emergency. Ophthalmology departments were also affected by the reorganization of healthcare services. CONCLUSION: The studies analaysed have some limitations. First, the sample size and the covered population consisted mainly of patients with mild disease. Moreover, the studies are often descriptive study, without a correlation analysis. Finally, no normal population was observed in the studies, so a normal control group should be included for comparison in future studies. With the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and with its high infectivity, it is necessary to rearrange ophthalmologist routine clinical practice in order to control viral spread and try to maximize patient and health-care provider’s safety.","Nuzzi, Raffaele; Carucci, Luigi Ludovico; Tripoli, Flavia",J Ophthalmic Inflamm Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32885277/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12348-020-00212-4,585

Due to lack of knowledge of the epidemiological cycle and absence of any type of vaccine or medications, the Government issued various non-pharmacological measures to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Several researchers applied the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deceased (SIRD) compartmental epidemiology process model to identifying the effect of different governments intervention methods enforced to mollify the spread of COVID-19 epidemic. In this paper, we aim to provide a modified SIRD model for COVID-19 spread prediction. We have analyzed the data of the Northern and Southern states of India from January 30, 2020, to October 24, 2020 using the proposed SIRD model and existing SIRD model. We have made the predictions with reasonable assumptions based on real data, considering that the precise course of an epidemic is highly dependent on how and when quarantine, isolation, and precautionary measures were imposed. The proposed method gives better approximation values of new cases, R0 (Reproductive Number), daily deaths, daily infectious, transmission rate, and recovered individuals.Through the analysis of the reported results, the proposed SIRD model can be an effective method for investigating the effect of government interventions on COVID-19 associated transmission and mortality rate at the time of epidemic.","Shringi, Sakshi; Sharma, Harish; Rathie, Pushpa Narayan; Bansal, Jagdish Chand; Nagar, Atulya",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34007123/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077921003933?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077921003933; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2021.111039,585
672616,"Letters from the pandemic: Nursing student narratives of change, challenges and thriving at the outset of COVID‐19",2021-04-19,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the reproduction number R has become a popular epidemiological metric used to communicate the state of the epidemic. At its most basic, R is defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by one primary infected individual. R seems convenient, because the epidemic is expanding if R>1 and contracting if R<1. The magnitude of R indicates by how much transmission needs to be reduced to control the epidemic. Using R in a naïve way can cause new problems. The reasons for this are threefold: (1) There is not just one definition of R but many, and the precise definition of R affects both its estimated value and how it should be interpreted. (2) Even with a particular clearly defined R, there may be different statistical methods used to estimate its value, and the choice of method will affect the estimate. (3) The availability and type of data used to estimate R vary, and it is not always clear what data should be included in the estimation. In this review, we discuss when R is useful, when it may be of use but needs to be interpreted with care, and when it may be an inappropriate indicator of the progress of the epidemic. We also argue that careful definition of R, and the data and methods used to estimate it, can make R a more useful metric for future management of the epidemic.","Vegvari, Carolin; Abbott, Sam; Ball, Frank; Brooks-Pollock, Ellen; Challen, Robert; Collyer, Benjamin S; Dangerfield, Ciara; Gog, Julia R; Gostic, Katelyn M; Heffernan, Jane M; Hollingsworth, T Déirdre; Isham, Valerie; Kenah, Eben; Mollison, Denis; Panovska-Griffiths, Jasmina; Pellis, Lorenzo; Roberts, Michael G; Scalia Tomba, Gianpaolo; Thompson, Robin N; Trapman, Pieter",Statistical methods in medical research,https://doi.org/10.1177/09622802211037079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34569883/,585

672768,Facilitating Test Status Information Communication in the Time of COVID-19,2021-04-09,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is a monocarboxypeptidase which metabolizes several peptides including the degradation of Ang II, a peptide with vasoconstrictive/proliferative/effects, to generate Ang 1–7, which acting through its receptor Mas exerts vasodilatory/anti-proliferative actions. The classical pathway of the RAS involving the ACE-Ang II-AT(1) receptor axis is antagonized by the second arm constituted by the ACE2-Ang 1–7/Mas receptor axis. Loss of ACE2 enhances the adverse pathological remodeling susceptibility to pressure-overload and myocardial infarction. Human recombinant ACE2 is also a negative regulator of Ang II-induced myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction and suppresses pressure-overload induced heart failure. Due to its characteristics, the ACE2-Ang 1–7/Mas axis may represent new possibilities for developing novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of heart failure. Human recombinant ACE2 has been safely administered to healthy human volunteers intravenously resulting in sustained lowering of plasma Ang II levels. In this review, we will summarize the beneficial effects of ACE2 in heart disease and the potential use of human recombinant ACE2 as a novel therapy for heart failure.","Patel, Vaibhav B.; Putko, Brendan; Wang, Zuocheng; Zhong, Jiu-Chang; Oudit, Gavin Y.",Drug Discov Today Ther Strateg,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ddstr.2013.11.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1740677313000193; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1740677313000193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362932/,585

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 610 patients admitted to our emergency unit from March 20, 2020, until April 11, 2020, with suspicion of COVID-19 were collected. Diagnostic values of low-dose chest CT for COVID-19 were calculated using consecutive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) as reference. Comparative analysis of the 199 COVID-19 positive versus 411 COVID-19 negative patients was done with identification of risk factors and predictors of worse outcome. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of low-dose CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19 respectively ranged from 75% (150/199) to 88% (175/199) and 94% (386/411) to 99% (386/389), depending on the inclusion of inconclusive results. On multivariate analysis, a higher body mass index (BMI), fever, and dyspnea on admission were risk factors for COVID-19 (all p-values < 0.05). The mortality rate was 12.6% (25/199). Higher age and high levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimers were predictors of worse outcome (all p-values < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Low-dose chest CT has a high specificity and a moderate to high sensitivity in symptomatic patients with suspicion of COVID-19 and could be used as an effective tool in setting of triage in high-prevalence areas.","Desmet, Jeroen; Biebaû, Charlotte; De Wever, Walter; Cockmartin, Lesley; Viktor, Verbraeken; Coolen, Johan; Verschakelen, Johny; Dubbeldam, Adriana",Journal of the Belgian Society of Radiology,https://doi.org/10.5334/jbsr.2319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33634237/,585

Several challenges exist in identifying effective compounds against viral infections: (1) at the initial stage of a new virus outbreak, little information, except for its genome information, may be available; (2) although the identified compounds may be effective, they may be toxic in vivo and (3) cytokine release syndrome (CRS) triggered by viral infections is the primary cause of mortality. Currently, an integrative tool that takes all those aspects into consideration for identifying effective compounds to prevent viral infections is absent. In this study, we developed iDMer, as an integrative and mechanism-driven response system for addressing these challenges during the sudden virus outbreaks. iDMer comprises three mechanism-driven compound identification modules, that is, a virus-host interaction-oriented module, an autophagy-oriented module and a CRS-oriented module. As a one-stop integrative platform, iDMer incorporates compound toxicity evaluation and compound combination identification for virus treatment with clear mechanisms. iDMer was successfully tested on five viruses, including the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Our results indicated that, for all five tested viruses, compounds that were reported in the literature or experimentally validated for virus treatment were enriched at the top, demonstrating the generalized effectiveness of iDMer. Finally, we demonstrated that combinations of the individual modules successfully identified combinations of compounds effective for virus intervention with clear mechanisms.","Wei, Zhiting; Gao, Yuli; Meng, Fangliangzi; Chen, Xin; Gong, Yukang; Zhu, Chenyu; Ju, Bin; Zhang, Chao; Liu, Zhongmin; Liu, Qi",Brief Bioinform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33302292/; https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa341,585

For these reasons, it is necessary to formulate rehabilitation programs for these patients, to help them restore physical and respiratory function and to reduce anxiety and depression, particularly patients with comorbidities and those who live alone or in rural settings, to restore a good quality of life.","Demeco, A.; Marotta, N.; Barletta, M.; Pino, I.; Marinaro, C.; Petraroli, A.; Moggio, L.; Ammendolia, Antonio",J Int Med Res,https://doi.org/10.1177/0300060520948382; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32840156/,585

677949,Trauma care in a low-COVID pandemic environment: A new normal,2020-06-12,"BACKGROUND: The interaction between COVID-19, non-communicable diseases, and chronic infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis is unclear, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries in Africa. South Africa has a national HIV prevalence of 19% among people aged 15–49 years and a tuberculosis prevalence of 0·7% in people of all ages. Using a nationally representative hospital surveillance system in South Africa, we aimed to investigate the factors associated with in-hospital mortality among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this cohort study, we used data submitted to DATCOV, a national active hospital surveillance system for COVID-19 hospital admissions, for patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 5, 2020, and March 27, 2021. Age, sex, race or ethnicity, and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, chronic cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease and asthma, chronic renal disease, malignancy in the past 5 years, HIV, and past and current tuberculosis) were considered as risk factors for COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality. COVID-19 in-hospital mortality, the main outcome, was defined as a death related to COVID-19 that occurred during the hospital stay and excluded deaths that occurred because of other causes or after discharge from hospital; therefore, only patients with a known in-hospital outcome (died or discharged alive) were included. Chained equation multiple imputation was used to account for missing data and random-effects multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the role of HIV status and underlying comorbidities on COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. FINDINGS: Among the 219 265 individuals admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and known in-hospital outcome data, 51 037 (23·3%) died. Most commonly observed comorbidities among individuals with available data were hypertension in 61 098 (37·4%) of 163 350, diabetes in 43 885 (27·4%) of 159 932, and HIV in 13 793 (9·1%) of 151 779. Tuberculosis was reported in 5282 (3·6%) of 146 381 individuals. Increasing age was the strongest predictor of COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. Other factors associated were HIV infection (adjusted odds ratio 1·34, 95% CI 1·27–1·43), past tuberculosis (1·26, 1·15–1·38), current tuberculosis (1·42, 1·22–1·64), and both past and current tuberculosis (1·48, 1·32–1·67) compared with never tuberculosis, as well as other described risk factors for COVID-19, such as male sex; non-White race; underlying hypertension, diabetes, chronic cardiac disease, chronic renal disease, and malignancy in the past 5 years; and treatment in the public health sector. After adjusting for other factors, people with HIV not on antiretroviral therapy (ART; adjusted odds ratio 1·45, 95% CI 1·22–1·72) were more likely to die in hospital than were people with HIV on ART. Among people with HIV, the prevalence of other comorbidities was 29·2% compared with 30·8% among HIV-uninfected individuals. Increasing number of comorbidities was associated with increased COVID-19 in-hospital mortality risk in both people with HIV and HIV-uninfected individuals. INTERPRETATION: Individuals identified as being at high risk of COVID-19 in-hospital mortality (older individuals and those with chronic comorbidities and people with HIV, particularly those not on ART) would benefit from COVID-19 prevention programmes such as vaccine prioritisation as well as early referral and treatment.

Will megacity regions evolve into socially infected breeding grounds for the rapid transmission of disease, or can they become critical spatial entities for the protection and promotion of population health? We address this question for the Pearl River Delta Region (PRD) based on recent data from Chinese sources, and on the experience of how New York, Greater London, Tokyo and Paris have grappled with the challenges of protecting population health and providing their populations with access to health care services. In some respects, there are some important lessons from comparative experience for PRD, notably the importance of covering the entire population for health care services and targeting special programs for those at highest risk for disease. In other respects, PRD's growth rate and sheer scale make it a unique megacity region that already faces new challenges and will require new solutions.","Fabre, Guilhem; Rodwin, Victor G",BMC Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7015-9-110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21968214/,585
680384,Labor Demand in the time of COVID-19: Evidence from vacancy postings and UI claims,2020-07-13,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged clinical diagnostic operations due to supply shortages and high staffing needs to collect nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples. Saliva is an easily accessible alternative specimen type to overcome some of these challenges. In this study, we first used paired saliva and NP swab specimens (n = 128) to compare test performance characteristics with three RNA extraction platforms, i.e., Maxwell RSC (Promega), MagNA Pure 96 (Roche), and KingFisher Flex (Thermo Fisher Scientific), together with two PCR chemistries, i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (2019-nCoV) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) quantitative PCR (qPCR) probe assay (Integrated DNA Technologies) and TagPath COVID-19 combination kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). This study demonstrated that both saliva and NP swab specimens performed well, with 97% agreement when tested by the CDC qPCR chemistry using Maxwell and MagNA Pure RNA extraction platforms. We then compared 12 weeks of saliva and NP swab testing results using two independent asymptomatic populations, including a community surveillance program using saliva samples only (n = 466) and preoperative screening using NP swab samples only (n = 8,461). The positive detection rates among participants with either saliva or NP swab samples were 1.07% and 1.12%, respectively, which confirms the low pretest probabilities for COVID-19 infections in asymptomatic populations. Notably, there was no increased proportion of low-titer cases (inconclusive results) reported in the asymptomatic groups, compared with the all-comers groups (0.21% and 0.66%, respectively, in the community population and 0.25% and 0.49%, respectively, in the preoperative population); this suggests that low-viral-titer carriers can be found similarly in both groups with saliva or NP swab specimens. In summary, saliva can be considered a good alternative for noninvasive but well-instructed self-collection. IMPORTANCE Our study shows that saliva is a noninvasive respiratory secretion sample type that contains equal or more host materials (RNase P), compared with those contained in the corresponding NP swab specimens, in 103 paired samples. SARS-CoV-2 detection with two RNA extraction platforms, Maxwell and MagNA Pure, with CDC qPCR chemistry showed similar test sensitivities for paired specimens. We then analyzed SARS-CoV-2 detections rates in two independent groups of asymptomatic participants, i.e., a group at a community screening station with supervised saliva collection only (n = 466) and a preoperative screening group (n = 8,461) with NP swabbing only. Similar detection rates of 1.07% for the community group and 1.12% for the preoperative group supported the similar test performances in these groups predicted to have low pretest probabilities of infection. With mindful preparation, saliva can be considered for schools and clinical participants when adequate collection education can be provided and compliance can be established.","Fan, Guang; Qin, Xuan; Streblow, Daniel N; Hoyos, Cristina Magallanes; Hansel, Donna E",Microbiology spectrum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34431689/; https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00062-21,585
681123,Injustices in pandemic vulnerability: A spatial-statistical analysis of the CDC Social Vulnerability Index and COVID-19 outcomes in the U.S.,2021-05-30,"Outdoor temperature lower than 50F and greater than 70F is shown to nearly double the transmission efficiency of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Outdoor temperature is an important factor behind the current surge in US Covid-19 cases. Correlation of northern state infection data and outdoor temperatures is used to identify the change in disease transmission efficiency as northern states passed through the lower temperature bound (50F) in spring, and more recently transitioned to temperatures above the higher bound (70F). At current disease transmission efficiency levels, social distancing must be increased above a UMD Social Distance Index (SDI) level of 36 to stop the accelerated increase of daily infection cases. At current disease transmission efficiency (G=0.19) and SDI of 33, the US will approach 150,000 infections per day in September before declining as average US temperature falls below 70F. A primary reason for enhanced disease transmission below 50F and above 70F is attributed to inadequate indoor ventilation. Swing season occurs when outdoor temperatures are between 50F and 70F, and is the time of year when homes and buildings are opened to the outdoors. Increased fresh air ventilation (greater than 40cfm per person), improved air filtration (MERV11 and greater filters), and UVGI (Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation, 0.02WUV per cfm airflow) coupled with wearing face masks, 6ft distancing and surface sanitation are estimated to reduce indoor disease transmission probability to a third of the transmission probability resulting from standard building ventilation practice.","Newell, T.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.20.20158238; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.20.20158238v1?rss=1,585

The mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have shown great promise in clinical trials. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of these vaccines under real-world conditions in the USA. Methods. Employees of the Cleveland Clinic Health System, previously not infected with SARS-CoV-2, and working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day COVID-19 vaccination began, were included. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, over the next 5 months, was compared among those who received the vaccine and those who did not, by modeling vaccination as a time-dependent covariate in Cox proportional hazards regression analyses adjusted for the slope of the epidemic curve as a continuous time-dependent covariate. Results. Of the 46866 included employees, 28223 (60%) were vaccinated by the end of the study period. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was much higher among those not vaccinated than those vaccinated. Only 15 (0.7%) of the 2154 SARS-CoV-2 infections during the study occurred among those vaccinated. After adjusting for the slope of the epidemic curve, age, and job type, vaccination was associated with a significantly reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 0.03, 95% C.I. 0.02 - 0.06, p < 0.001), corresponding to a vaccine effectiveness rate of 97.1% (95% CI 94.3 - 98.5). Vaccine effectiveness was 89.2% at 7 days and 95.0% at 14 days after the first vaccine dose. Conclusions. The mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are over 97% protective against COVID-19 in the working-age population, with substantial protection possibly apparent within a few days of the first dose.","Shrestha, N.

682950,The consideration for outpatient mastectomy during the COVID-19 global pandemic,2021-01-04,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data obtained during the initial wave of the COVID-19 epidemic showed that persons dying with COVID-19 were typically older men with multiple chronic conditions. No studies have assessed if the characteristics of patients dying with COVID-19 have changed in the second phase of the epidemic, when the initial wave subsided. The aim of the present study was to compare characteristics of patients dying with COVID-19 in Italy in the first ‘peak’ phase of the epidemic and in its second phase. METHODS: Medical charts of patients with COVID-19 who died while in hospital in Italy were reviewed to extract information on pre-existing comorbidities, in-hospital complications, and disease trajectories. The course of the epidemic was classified in two 3-month periods: March–May 2020 and June–August 2020. FINDINGS: Overall, in the Italian population, 34,191 COVID-19 deaths occurred in March–May 2020 and 1,404 in June–August 2020. Patients dying in March–May were significantly younger (80.1 ± 10.6 vs. 82.8 ± 11.1 years, p < 0.001) and less frequently female (41.9% vs. 61.8%, p < 0.001) than those dying in June–August. The medical charts of 3533 patients who died with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in March–May 2020 (10.3% of all deaths occurring in this period) and 203 patients who died in June–August 2020 (14.5% of all deaths occurring in this period) were analysed. Patients who died in March–May 2020, compared to those who died in June–August 2020, had significantly lower rates of multiple comorbidities (3 or more comorbidities: 61.8% vs 74.5%, p = 0.001) and superinfections (15.2% vs. 52.5%, p < 0.001). Treatment patterns also substantially differed in the two study periods, with patients dying in March–May 2020 being less likely to be treated with steroids (41.7% vs. 69.3%, p < 0.001) and more likely to receive antivirals (59.3% vs. 41.4%, p < 0.001). Survival time also largely differed, with patients dying in March–May 2020 showing a shorter time from symptoms onset to death (mean interval: 15.0 vs. 46.6 days, p < 0.001). The differences observed between the two periods remained significant in a multivariate analysis. INTERPRETATION: The clinical characteristics of patients dying with COVID-19 in Italy, their treatment and symptom-to-death survival time have significantly changed overtime. This is probably due to an improved organization and delivery of care and to a better knowledge of disease treatment.

Crude and adjusted diagnostic odds ratios (aDORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the case definitions and symptoms for all weeks and epidemic weeks were estimated. The most predictive case definition for laboratory-confirmed influenza was the World Health Organization (WHO) case definition for ILI in all weeks (aDOR 2.69; 95% CI 2.42–2.99) and epidemic weeks (aDOR 2.20; 95% CI 1.90–2.54). The symptoms that were significant positive predictors for confirmed influenza were fever, cough, myalgia, headache, malaise, and sudden onset. Fever had the highest aDOR in all weeks (4.03; 95% CI 3.38–4.80) and epidemic weeks (2.78; 95% CI 2.21–3.50). All of the case definitions assessed performed better in patients with comorbidities than in those without. The performance of symptoms varied by age groups, with fever being of high value in older people, and cough being of high value in children. In patients with comorbidities, the performance of fever was the highest (aDOR 5.45; 95% CI 3.43–8.66). No differences in the performance of the case definition or symptoms in influenza cases according to virus type were found.","Domínguez, Àngela; Soldevila, Núria; Torner, Núria; Martínez, Ana; Godoy, Pere; Rius, Cristina; Jané, Mireia",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31947696/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v12010095,585

However, baseline CD4 count and the time period between initial infection and the diagnosis amongst PLHIV in Bhutan never been evaluated. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of the diagnosed PLHIV from the existing data system from January 10 to 30, 2021. Out of 512 reported HIV cases, 488 of those who were more than or equal to 18 years old and had their CD4 count testing within 6 months before initiating ART were considered for analysis. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to analyze the characteristics of the study population and relationship were established using the χ (2) Test. We have sought ethics approval and waiver for informed consent as it is the retrospective study of the client's record. The client's confidentiality was ensured by removing all the identifiers. RESULTS: The mean CD4 was 345 cells/ml for males and females. Twenty‐five percent of the clients had CD4 counts below 200, 30%, between 200 and 349, 25% between 350 and 499, and 20% above 500 cells/ml. A larger number of males showed a CD4 count below 200 cells/ml while more females showed a CD4 count more than 500 cells/ml. The mean time interval between initial infection to the first diagnosis was 4 years in males and females. However, about one‐fourth were found to have been infected between 5 and 8 years before diagnosis and less than 10% were diagnosed within less than 1 year of infection. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed a late diagnosis of HIV infection in Bhutan thereby risking the transmission to the community and risk of severe disease and mortality. The upscaling of voluntary counseling and testing, medical screening, and alternative methods like community‐based testing including HIV Self Testing for early detection needs to be implemented in the country.","khandu, Lekey; Dhakal, Guru P.; Lhazeen, Karma",Immun Inflamm Dis,https://doi.org/10.1002/iid3.444; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33945664/,585

METHODS: Based on online data released officially by 21 Chinese cities from January 22 to February 15, 2020, the incubation period of COVID‐19 patients who had travelled to Hubei was studied according to age. Previous studies were reviewed and compared. RESULTS: The study recruited 136 COVID‐19 patients who had travelled to Hubei during January 5‐31, 2020, stayed for 1‐2 days, and returned with symptom onset during January 10‐February 6, 2020. The median age was 50.5 years (range 1‐86 years), and 22 patients (16.2%) were aged ≥65 years. The age‐stratified incubation period was U‐shaped with higher values at extremes of age. The median COVID‐19 incubation period was 8.3 (90% confidence interval [CI], 7.4‐9.2) days for all patients, 7.6 (90% CI, 6.7‐8.6) days for younger adults, and 11.2 (90% CI, 9.0‐13.5) days for older adults. The 5th/25th/75th/90th percentiles were 2.3/5.3/11.3/14.2 days for all, 2.0/5.0/10.5/13.2 days for younger adults, and 3.1/7.8/14.4/17.0 days for older adults. There were 11 published studies on COVID‐19 incubation periods up to March 30, 2020, reporting means of 1.8‐7.2 days, and medians of 4‐7.5 days, but there was no specific study on the effect of age on incubation period. One study showed that severe COVID‐19 cases, which included more elderly patients, had longer incubation periods. CONCLUSION: Based on 136 patients with a travel history to Hubei, the epicenter of COVID‐19, the COVID‐19 incubation period was found to be longer in older adults. This finding has important implications for diagnosis, prevention, and control of COVID‐19.","Kong, Tak‐kwan",Aging Med (Milton),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32661509/; https://doi.org/10.1002/agm2.12114,585
684569,The implications of face masks for babies and families during the COVID-19 pandemic: A discussion paper,2020-10-29,"Hendra and Nipah viruses (family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus) are zoonotic RNA viruses that cause lethal disease in humans and are designated as Biosafety Level 4 (BSL4) agents. Moreover, henipaviruses belong to the same group of viruses that cause disease more commonly in humans such as measles, mumps and respiratory syncytial virus. Due to the relatively recent emergence of the henipaviruses and the practical constraints of performing functional genomics studies at high levels of containment, our understanding of the henipavirus infection cycle is incomplete. In this chapter we describe recent loss-of-function (i.e. RNAi) functional genomics screens that shed light on the henipavirus–host interface at a genome-wide level. Further to this, we cross-reference RNAi results with studies probing host proteins targeted by henipavirus proteins, such as nuclear proteins and immune modulators. These functional genomics studies join a growing body of evidence demonstrating that nuclear and nucleolar host proteins play a crucial role in henipavirus infection. Furthermore these studies will underpin future efforts to define the role of nucleolar host–virus interactions in infection and disease.","Stewart, Cameron R.; Deffrasnes, Celine; Foo, Chwan Hong; Bean, Andrew G.

The current crosslinguistic, multisite study is the first of its kind in South Africa, considering the influence of a range of individual and sociocultural factors on expressive vocabulary size of young children. Caregivers of toddlers aged 16 to 32 months acquiring Afrikaans (n = 110), isiXhosa (n = 115), South African English (n = 105), or Xitsonga (n = 98) as home language completed a family background questionnaire and the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) about their children. Based on a revised version of Bronfenbrenner’s (1977) ecological systems theory, information was obtained from the family background questionnaire on individual factors (the child’s age and sex), microsystem-related factors (the number of other children and number of adults in the child’s household, maternal level of education, and SES), and exosystem-related factors (home language and geographic area, namely rural or urban). All sociocultural and individual factors combined explained 25% of the variance in expressive vocabulary size. Partial correlations between these sociocultural factors and the toddlers’ expressive vocabulary scores on 10 semantic domains yielded important insights into the impact of geographic area on the nature and size of children’s expressive vocabulary. Unlike in previous studies, maternal level of education and SES did not play a significant role in predicting children’s expressive vocabulary scores. These results indicate that there exists an interplay of sociocultural and individual influences on vocabulary development that requires a more complex ecological model of language development to understand the interaction between various sociocultural factors in diverse contexts.","Southwood, Frenette; White, Michelle J.; Brookes, Heather; Pascoe, Michelle; Ndhambi, Mikateko; Yalala, Sefela; Mahura, Olebeng; Mössmer, Martin; Oosthuizen, Helena; Brink, Nina; Alcock, Katie",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34045992/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.642315,585

A parallel group, single-blind randomised controlled trial was conducted across older adult care homes in England and Japan. Participants randomly allocated to the Experimental Group or Control Group 1 received a Pepper robot for up 18 h across 2 weeks. Two versions of the CARESSES artificial intelligence were tested: a fully culturally competent system (Experimental Group) and a more limited version (Control Group 1). Control Group 2 (Care As Usual) participants did not receive a robot. Quantitative outcomes of interest reported in the current paper were health-related quality of life (SF-36), loneliness (ULS-8), and perceptions of robotic cultural competence (CCATool-Robotics). Thirty-three residents completed all procedures. The difference in SF-36 Emotional Wellbeing scores between Experimental Group and Care As Usual participants over time was significant (F[1] = 6.614, sig = .019, η(p)(2) = .258), as was the comparison between Any Robot used and Care As Usual (F[1] = 5.128, sig = .031, η(p)(2) = .146). There were no significant changes in SF-36 physical health subscales. ULS-8 loneliness scores slightly improved among Experimental and Control Group 1 participants compared to Care As Usual participants, but this was not significant.

685461,Relational ethical approaches to the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-06-10,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is detectable in saliva from asymptomatic individuals, suggesting a potential benefit from the use of mouth rinses to suppress viral load and reduce virus spread. Published studies on the reduction of SARS-CoV-2-induced cytotoxic effects by mouth rinses do not exclude antiseptic mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity. Here, we determined the effect of commercially available mouth rinses and antiseptic povidone-iodine on the infectivity of replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 viruses and of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viruses. We first determined the effect of mouth rinses on cell viability to ensure that antiviral activity was not a consequence of mouth rinse-induced cytotoxicity. Colgate Peroxyl (hydrogen peroxide) exhibited the most cytotoxicity, followed by povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), and Listerine (essential oils and alcohol). The potent antiviral activities of Colgate Peroxyl mouth rinse and povidone-iodine were the consequence of rinse-mediated cellular damage when the products were present during infection. The potency of CHG was greater when the product was not washed off after virus attachment, suggesting that the prolonged effect of mouth rinses on cells impacts the antiviral outcome. To minimalize mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity, mouth rinse was largely removed from treated viruses by centrifugation prior to infection of cells. A 5% (v/v) dilution of Colgate Peroxyl or povidone-iodine completely blocked viral infectivity. A similar 5% (v/v) dilution of Listerine or CHG had a moderate suppressive effect on the virus, but a 50% (v/v) dilution of Listerine or CHG blocked viral infectivity completely. Mouth rinses inactivated the virus without prolonged incubation. The new infectivity assay, with limited impacts of mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity, showed the differential effects of mouth rinses on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results indicate that mouth rinses can significantly reduce virus infectivity, suggesting a potential benefit for reducing SARS-CoV-2 spread.","Xu, Chuan; Wang, Annie; Hoskin, Eileen R.; Cugini, Carla; Markowitz, Kenneth; Chang, Theresa L.; Fine, Daniel H.",Pathogens,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10030272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33804294/,585

With the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) genome the efficient (>40 μg per 10(6) cells) and stable (>20 passages) expression of the foreign genes has been shown. Knowledge of the transcription mechanism in coronaviruses has been significantly increased, making possible the fine regulation of foreign gene expression. A new family of vectors based on single coronavirus genomes, in which essential genes have been deleted, has emerged including replication-competent, propagation-deficient vectors. Vector biosafety is being increased by relocating the RNA packaging signal to the position previously occupied by deleted essential genes, to prevent the rescue of fully competent viruses that might arise from recombination events with wild-type field coronaviruses. The large cloning capacity of coronaviruses (>5 kb) and the possibility of engineering the tissue and species tropism to target expression to different organs and animal species, including humans, has increased the potential of coronaviruses as vectors for vaccine development and, possibly, gene therapy.","Enjuanes, L.; Sola, I.; Alonso, S.; Escors, D.; Zúñiga, S.",Coronavirus Replication and Reverse Genetics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15609512/,585

Prolonged mechanical ventilation may require a tracheostomy, but the increased risk for contamination is a matter of considerable debate. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of safety and effects of surgical tracheostomy on ventilation parameters and outcome in patients with COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study between March 27 and May 18, 2020, in a single-center coronavirus disease-designated ICU at a tertiary care German hospital. PATIENTS: Patients with COVID-19 were treated with open surgical tracheostomy due to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical and ventilation data were obtained from medical records in a retrospective manner. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV‑2 infection and surgical tracheostomy were analyzed. The age range was 42–87 years. All patients received open tracheostomy between 2–16 days after admission. Ventilation after tracheostomy was less invasive (reduction in PEAK and positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]) and lung compliance increased over time after tracheostomy. Also, sedative drugs could be reduced, and patients had a reduced need of norepinephrine to maintain hemodynamic stability. Six of 18 patients died. All surgical staff were equipped with N99-masks and facial shields or with powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that open surgical tracheostomy can be performed without severe complications in patients with COVID-19. Tracheostomy may reduce invasiveness of mechanical ventilation and the need for sedative drugs and norepinehprine. Recommendations for personal protective equipment (PPE) for surgical staff should be followed when PPE is available to avoid contamination of the personnel.","Schuler, Patrick J.; Greve, Jens; Hoffmann, Thomas K.; Hahn, Janina; Boehm, Felix; Bock, Bastian; Reins, Johannes; Ehrmann, Ulrich; Barth, Eberhard; Traeger, Karl; Jungwirth, Bettina; Wepler, Martin",HNO,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33666682/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00106-021-01021-4,585

Early in the pandemic, most hospitals required two negative RT-PCR tests before discontinuing isolation in patients with Covid-19. Many patients, however, have persistently positive RT-PCR tests for weeks to months following clinical recovery and multiple studies now indicate that persistently positive RT-PCRs generally do not reflect replication-competent virus. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be most contagious around the time of symptom onset and infectivity rapidly decreases thereafter to near-zero after about 10 days in mild-moderately ill patients and 15 days in severely-critically ill and immunocompromised patients. The longest interval associated with replication-competent virus thus far is 20 days from symptom onset. This review summarizes evidence-to-date on the duration of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and how this has informed evolving public health recommendations on when it is safe to discontinue isolation precautions.","Rhee, Chanu; Kanjilal, Sanjat; Baker, Meghan; Klompas, Michael",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33029620/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1249,585

Biolegitimacy and harm reduction during COVID‐19,2021-04-22,"Accurate modeling provides a means by which a complex problem can be examined for informed decision-making. We present a particle-based SEIR epidemic simulator as a tool to assess the impact of vaccination strategies on viral propagation and to model both sterilizing and effective immunization outcomes. The simulator includes modules to support contact tracing of the interactions amongst individuals as well as epidemiological testing of the general population. The simulator particles are distinguished by age, thus enabling a more accurate representation of the rates of infection and mortality in accordance with differential demographic susceptibilities and medical outcomes. The simulator can be calibrated by region of interest and variable vaccination strategies (i.e. random or prioritized by age) so as to enable locality-sensitive virus mitigation policy measures and resource allocation. The results described, based on the experience of the province of Lecco, Italy, indicate that the tool can be used to evaluate vaccination strategies in a way that incorporates local circumstances of viral propagation and demographic susceptibilities. Further, the simulator accounts for modeling the distinction between sterilizing immunization, in which immunized people are no longer contagious, and that of effective immunization, in which symptoms and mortality outcomes are diminished but individuals can still transmit the virus.","Karabay, A.; Kuzdeuov, A.; Lewis, M.; Varol, A.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional, bilingual web survey of 237 women who gave birth at two hospitals in New York City and assessed patient-reported experience and outcomes following the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the New York region. We ascertained SARS-CoV-2 status at delivery from the electronic medical record using participant-reported name and date of birth. We compared birth experience during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 15, 2020–May 11, 2020) to a pre-pandemic response period (January 1, 2020–March 14, 2020). We estimated risk ratios for associations between birth experience and anxiety, depressive symptoms, stress, birth-related PTSD, emergency department visits, timely postpartum visit, and exclusive breastfeeding. Multivariable models adjusted for age, race-ethnicity, insurance, education, parity, BMI, previous experience of maltreatment/abuse and cesarean delivery. RESULTS: Women who gave birth during the peak of the pandemic response, and those that were SARS-CoV-2 positive, Black, and Latina, had lower birth satisfaction and higher perceived health care discrimination. Women with lower birth satisfaction were more likely to report higher postpartum anxiety, stress, depressive symptoms, and lower exclusive breastfeeding. Experiencing one or more incident of health care discrimination was associated with higher levels of postpartum stress and birth-related PTSD.
