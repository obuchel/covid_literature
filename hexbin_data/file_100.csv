174,174,174,Mathematical Analysis of Copy Number Variation in a DNA Sample Using Digital PCR on a Nanofluidic Device,13.377748,5.8262053,2008-08-06,"Copy Number Variations (CNVs) of regions of the human genome have been associated with multiple diseases. We present an algorithm which is mathematically sound and computationally efficient to accurately analyze CNV in a DNA sample utilizing a nanofluidic device, known as the digital array. This numerical algorithm is utilized to compute copy number variation and the associated statistical confidence interval and is based on results from probability theory and statistics. We also provide formulas which can be used as close approximations.","Dube, Simant; Qin, Jian; Ramakrishnan, Ramesh",PLoS One,100,1
512,512,512,Implications of copy number variation in people with chromosomal abnormalities: potential for greater variation in copy number state may contribute to variability of phenotype,13.329265,5.795318,2010-08-10,"Copy number variation is common in the human genome with many regions, overlapping thousands of genes, now known to be deleted or amplified. Aneuploidies and other forms of chromosomal imbalance have a wide range of adverse phenotypes and are a common cause of birth defects resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. “Normal” copy number variants (CNVs) embedded within the regions of chromosome imbalance may affect the clinical outcomes by altering the local copy number of important genes or regulatory regions: this could alleviate or exacerbate certain phenotypes. In this way CNVs may contribute to the clinical variability seen in many disorders caused by chromosomal abnormalities, such as the congenital heart defects (CHD) seen in ~40% of Down’s syndrome (DS) patients. Investigation of CNVs may therefore help to pinpoint critical genes or regulatory elements, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions, also shedding light on the aetiology of such phenotypes in people without major chromosome imbalances, and ultimately leading to their improved detection and treatment.","de Smith, Adam J.; Trewick, Anne L.; Blakemore, Alexandra I.

The dynamics and the factors causing outbreaks of these diseases can be better understood using mathematical models, which are fit to data. Here we investigate the dynamics of a Hepatitis E outbreak in the Kitgum region of northern Uganda during 2007 to 2009. First, we use the data to determine that [Image: see text] is approximately 2.25 for the outbreak. Secondly, we use a model to estimate that the critical level of latrine and bore hole coverages needed to eradicate the epidemic is at least [Image: see text] and [Image: see text] respectively. Lastly, we further investigate the relationship between the co-infection factor for malaria and Hepatitis E on the value of [Image: see text] for Hepatitis E.

This need is of particular relevance for developing countries, since they host the majority of the global urban population and are disproportionally affected by the burden of disease. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) data-loggers to track the fine-scale (within city) mobility patterns of 582 residents from two neighborhoods from the city of Iquitos, Peru. We used ∼2.3 million GPS data-points to quantify age-specific mobility parameters and dynamic co-location networks among all tracked individuals. Geographic space significantly affected human mobility, giving rise to highly local mobility kernels. Most (∼80%) movements occurred within 1 km of an individual’s home. Potential hourly contacts among individuals were highly irregular and temporally unstructured. Only up to 38% of the tracked participants showed a regular and predictable mobility routine, a sharp contrast to the situation in the developed world. As a case study, we quantified the impact of spatially and temporally unstructured routines on the dynamics of transmission of an influenza-like pathogen within an Iquitos neighborhood. Temporally unstructured daily routines (e.g., not dominated by a single location, such as a workplace, where an individual repeatedly spent significant amount of time) increased an epidemic’s final size and effective reproduction number by 20% in comparison to scenarios modeling temporally structured contacts. Our findings provide a mechanistic description of the basic rules that shape human mobility within a resource-poor urban center, and contribute to the understanding of the role of fine-scale patterns of individual movement and co-location in infectious disease dynamics. More generally, this study emphasizes the need for careful consideration of human social interactions when designing infectious disease mitigation strategies, particularly within resource-poor urban environments.","Vazquez-Prokopec, Gonzalo M.; Bisanzio, Donal; Stoddard, Steven T.; Paz-Soldan, Valerie; Morrison, Amy C.; Elder, John P.; Ramirez-Paredes, Jhon; Halsey, Eric S.; Kochel, Tadeusz J.; Scott, Thomas W.; Kitron, Uriel",PLoS One,100,11

However, how these genes evolved and to what extent they diverged in humans remain to be investigated specifically. Based on syntenic mapping of chordate genomes, we reveal that diverging homologs with a prototypic CEACAM architecture–including an extracellular domain with immunoglobulin variable and constant domain-like regions, and an intracellular domain containing ITAM motif–are present from cartilaginous fish to humans, but are absent in sea lamprey, cephalochordate or urochordate. Interestingly, the CEACAM/PSG gene inventory underwent radical divergence in various vertebrate lineages: from zero in avian species to dozens in therian mammals. In addition, analyses of genetic variations in human populations showed the presence of various types of copy number variations (CNVs) at the CEACAM/PSG locus. These copy number polymorphisms have 3–80% frequency in select populations, and encompass single to more than six PSG genes. Furthermore, we found that CEACAM/PSG genes contain a significantly higher density of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) compared to the chromosome average, and many CEACAM/PSG SNPs exhibit high population differentiation. Taken together, our study suggested that CEACAM/PSG genes have had a more dynamic evolutionary history in vertebrates than previously thought. Given that CEACAM/PSGs play important roles in maternal–fetal interaction and pathogen recognition, these data have laid the groundwork for future analysis of adaptive CEACAM/PSG genotype-phenotypic relationships in normal and complicated pregnancies as well as other etiologies.","Chang, Chia Lin; Semyonov, Jenia; Cheng, Po Jen; Huang, Shang Yu; Park, Jae Il; Tsai, Huai-Jen; Lin, Cheng-Yung; Grützner, Frank; Soong, Yung Kuei; Cai, James J.; Hsu, Sheau Yu Teddy",PLoS One,100,1

These parasites are transmitted by hippoboscid flies of the genus Olfersia; strong specificity has been suggested between the vector and its vertebrate host. We investigated the prevalence of Haemoproteus infection in Suliformes and hippoboscid flies in two oceanic islands of the Western Indian Ocean: Europa and Tromelin. In total, 209 blood samples were collected from great frigatebirds (Fregata minor), masked boobies (Sula dactylatra) and red-footed boobies (Sula sula). Forty-one hippoboscid flies were also collected from birds. Seventeen frigatebirds and one fly collected on Europa tested positive for the presence of Haemoproteus parasites by polymerase chain reaction. Phylogenetic analyses based on partial sequences of the Cytochrome b gene showed that parasites were closely related to Haemoproteus iwa reported from frigatebirds in the Pacific Ocean and in the Caribbean. Plasmodium was also detected in a frigatebird on Europa; however, its placement on the phylogenetic tree could not be resolved. We provide strong support for transmission of blood parasites in seabirds in the Western Indian Ocean and suggest that migrations between the Pacific and the Indian oceans could favor the large-scale distribution of Haemoproteus iwa in frigatebird populations.","Bastien, Matthieu; Jaeger, Audrey; Le Corre, Matthieu; Tortosa, Pablo; Lebarbenchon, Camille",PLoS One,100,1

Multicenter studies rely on data derived from different institutions. Forms can be designed to standardize the reporting process allowing reliable comparison of data. Objective. The purpose of the report is to provide a standardized method, developed as a part of a multicenter study of vertically transmitted HIV, for assessing chest radiographic results. Materials and methods. Eight hundred and five infants and children were studied at five centers; 3057 chest radiographs were scored. Data were entered using a forced-choice, graded response for 12 findings. Quality assurance measures and inter-rater agreement statistics are reported. Results. The form used for reporting chest radiographic results is presented. Inter-rater agreement was moderate to high for most findings, with the best correlation reported for the presence of bronchovascular markings and/or reticular densities addressed as a composite question (kappa = 0.71). The presence of nodular densities (kappa = 0.56) and parenchymal consolidation (kappa = 0.57) had moderate agreement. Agreement for lung volume was low. Conclusion.

1755,1755,1755,Vaccination with Human Papillomavirus Pseudovirus-Encapsidated Plasmids Targeted to Skin Using Microneedles,13.687997,5.982003,2015-03-18,"Human papilloma virus-like particles (HPV VLP) serve as the basis of the current licensed vaccines for HPV. We have previously shown that encapsidation of DNA expressing the model antigen M/M2 from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in HPV pseudovirions (PsV) is immunogenic when delivered intravaginally. Because the HPV capsids confer tropism for basal epithelium, they represent attractive carriers for vaccination targeted to the skin using microneedles. In this study we asked: 1) whether HPV16 VLP administered by microneedles could induce protective immune responses to HPV16 and 2) whether HPV16 PsV-encapsidated plasmids delivered by microneedles could elicit immune responses to both HPV and the antigen delivered by the transgene. Mice immunized with HPV16 VLP coated microneedles generated robust neutralizing antibody responses and were protected from HPV16 challenge. Microneedle arrays coated with HPV16-M/M2 or HPV16-F protein (genes of RSV) were then tested and dose-dependent HPV and F-specific antibody responses were detected post-immunization, and M/M2-specific T-cell responses were detected post RSV challenge, respectively. HPV16 PsV-F immunized mice were fully protected from challenge with HPV16 PsV and had reduced RSV viral load in lung and nose upon intranasal RSV challenge. In summary, HPV16 PsV-encapsidated DNA delivered by microneedles induced neutralizing antibody responses against HPV and primed for antibody and T-cell responses to RSV antigens encoded by the encapsidated plasmids. Although the immunogenicity of the DNA component was just above the dose response threshold, the HPV-specific immunity was robust. Taken together, these data suggest microneedle delivery of lyophilized HPV PsV could provide a practical, thermostable combined vaccine approach that could be developed for clinical evaluation.","Kines, Rhonda C.; Zarnitsyn, Vladimir; Johnson, Teresa R.; Pang, Yuk-Ying S.; Corbett, Kizzmekia S.; Nicewonger, John D.; Gangopadhyay, Anu; Chen, Man; Liu, Jie; Prausnitz, Mark R.; Schiller, John T.; Graham, Barney S.",PLoS One,100,11

T. marneffei cells have been shown to become melanized in vivo. Melanins are pigment biopolymers which act as a non-specific protectant against various stressors and which play an important role during virulence in fungi. The synthesis of the two most commonly found melanins in fungi, the eumelanin DOPA-melanin and the allomelanin DHN-melanin, requires the action of laccase enzymes. The T. marneffei genome encodes a number of laccases and this study describes the characterization of one of these, pbrB, during growth and development. A strain carrying a PbrB-GFP fusion shows that pbrB is expressed at high levels during asexual development (conidiation) but not in cells growing vegetatively. The pbrB gene is required for the synthesis of DHN-melanin in conidia and when deleted results in brown pigmented conidia, in contrast to the green conidia of the wild type.","Sapmak, Ariya; Boyce, Kylie J.; Andrianopoulos, Alex; Vanittanakom, Nongnuch",PLoS One,100,1
1865,1865,1865,Bone Regeneration Based on Tissue Engineering Conceptions — A 21st Century Perspective,13.370676,5.7346783,2013-09-25,"The role of Bone Tissue Engineering in the field of Regenerative Medicine has been the topic of substantial research over the past two decades. Technological advances have improved orthopaedic implants and surgical techniques for bone reconstruction. However, improvements in surgical techniques to reconstruct bone have been limited by the paucity of autologous materials available and donor site morbidity. Recent advances in the development of biomaterials have provided attractive alternatives to bone grafting expanding the surgical options for restoring the form and function of injured bone. Specifically, novel bioactive (second generation) biomaterials have been developed that are characterised by controlled action and reaction to the host tissue environment, whilst exhibiting controlled chemical breakdown and resorption with an ultimate replacement by regenerating tissue. Future generations of biomaterials (third generation) are designed to be not only osteoconductive but also osteoinductive, i.e. to stimulate regeneration of host tissues by combining tissue engineering and in situ tissue regeneration methods with a focus on novel applications. These techniques will lead to novel possibilities for tissue regeneration and repair. At present, tissue engineered constructs that may find future use as bone grafts for complex skeletal defects, whether from post-traumatic, degenerative, neoplastic or congenital/developmental “origin” require osseous reconstruction to ensure structural and functional integrity. Engineering functional bone using combinations of cells, scaffolds and bioactive factors is a promising strategy and a particular feature for future development in the area of hybrid materials which are able to exhibit suitable biomimetic and mechanical properties. This review will discuss the state of the art in this field and what we can expect from future generations of bone regeneration concepts.","Henkel, Jan; Woodruff, Maria A.; Epari, Devakara R.; Steck, Roland; Glatt, Vaida; Dickinson, Ian C.; Choong, Peter F.

To survey the prevalence of tick-borne known and putative pathogens, we tested 982 individual adult and nymphal I. pacificus ticks collected throughout California between 2007 and 2009 using a broad-range PCR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) assay designed to detect a wide range of tick-borne microorganisms. Overall, 1.4% of the ticks were found to be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, 2.0% were infected with Borrelia miyamotoi and 0.3% were infected with Anaplasma phagocytophilum. In addition, 3.0% were infected with Babesia odocoilei. About 1.2% of the ticks were co-infected with more than one pathogen or putative pathogen. In addition, we identified a novel Anaplasmataceae species that we characterized by sequencing of its 16S rRNA, groEL, gltA, and rpoB genes. Sequence analysis indicated that this organism is phylogenetically distinct from known Anaplasma species with its closest genetic near neighbors coming from Asia. The prevalence of this novel Anaplasmataceae species was as high as 21% at one site, and it was detected in 4.9% of ticks tested statewide. Based upon this genetic characterization we propose that this organism be called ‘Candidatus Cryptoplasma californiense’. Knowledge of this novel microbe will provide awareness for the community about the breadth of the I. pacificus microbiome, the concept that this bacterium could be more widely spread; and an opportunity to explore whether this bacterium also contributes to human or animal disease burden.","Eshoo, Mark W.; Carolan, Heather E.; Massire, Christian; Chou, Danny M.; Crowder, Chris D.; Rounds, Megan A.; Phillipson, Curtis A.; Schutzer, Steven E.; Ecker, David J.",PLoS One,100,1

We previously identified the founding member of the Eukaryotic EndoU ribonuclease family, whose components display unique biochemical features and are flexibly involved in important biological processes, such as ribosome biogenesis, tumorigenesis and viral replication. Here we report the discovery of the CG3303 gene product, which we named DendoU, as a novel family member in Drosophila. Functional characterisation revealed that DendoU is essential for Drosophila viability and nervous system activity. Pan-neuronal silencing of dendoU resulted in fly immature phenotypes, highly reduced lifespan and dramatic motor performance defects. Neuron-subtype selective silencing showed that DendoU is particularly important in cholinergic circuits. At the molecular level, we unveiled that DendoU is a positive regulator of the neurodegeneration-associated protein dTDP-43, whose downregulation recapitulates the ensemble of dendoU-dependent phenotypes. This interdisciplinary work, which comprehends in silico, in vitro and in vivo studies, unveils a relevant role for DendoU in Drosophila nervous system physio-pathology and highlights that DendoU-mediated neurotoxicity is, at least in part, contributed by dTDP-43 loss-of-function.","Laneve, Pietro; Piacentini, Lucia; Casale, Assunta Maria; Capauto, Davide; Gioia, Ubaldo; Cappucci, Ugo; Di Carlo, Valerio; Bozzoni, Irene; Di Micco, Patrizio; Morea, Veronica; Di Franco, Carmela Antonia; Caffarelli, Elisa",Sci Rep,100,1

Newly developed evaluation methods, the overall filter quality (q(f,o)) and the q(f) ratio were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of decontamination methods for respirators. A scanning mobility particle sizer is utilized to measure the concentration of polydispersed particles with diameter 14.6–594 nm. The penetration of particles and pressure drop (Δp) through the mask are used to determine q(f) and q(f,o). Experimental results reveal that the most penetrating particle size (MPS) for the pre-decontaminated N95, Gauze and Spunlace masks were 118 nm, 461 nm and 279 nm, respectively, and the respective penetration rates were 2.6%, 23.2% and 70.0%. The Δp through the pretreated N95 masks was 9.2 mm H(2)O at the breathing flow rate of heavy-duty workers, exceeding the Δp values obtained through Gauze and Spunlace masks. Decontamination increased the sizes of the most penetrating particles, changing the q(f) values of all of the masks: q(f) fell as particle size increased because the penetration increased. Bleach increased the Δp of N95, but destroyed the Gauze mask. However, the use of an autoclave reduces the Δp values of both the N95 and the Gauze mask. Neither the rice cooker nor ethanol altered the Δp of the Gauze mask. Chemical decontamination methods reduced the q(f,o) values for the three electret masks. The value of q(f,o) for PM(0.1) exceeded that for PM(0.1–0.6), because particles smaller than 100 nm had lower penetration, resulting in a better q(f) for a given pressure drop. The values of q(f,o), particularly for PM(0.1), reveal that for the tested treatments and masks, physical decontamination methods are less destructive to the filter than chemical methods. Nevertheless, when purchasing new or reusing FFRs, penetration should be regarded as the priority.","Lin, Tzu-Hsien; Chen, Chih-Chieh; Huang, Sheng-Hsiu; Kuo, Chung-Wen; Lai, Chane-Yu; Lin, Wen-Yinn",PLoS One,100,1

The perception of its physiological function was restricted to sex determination and spermatogenesis. These views have been challenged in recent times with the identification of multiple ubiquitously expressed Y-chromosome genes and the discovery of several unexpected associations between the Y chromosome, immune system and complex polygenic traits. The collected evidence suggests that the Y chromosome influences immune and inflammatory responses in men, translating into genetically programmed susceptibility to diseases with a strong immune component. Phylogenetic studies reveal that carriers of a common European lineage of the Y chromosome (haplogroup I) possess increased risk of coronary artery disease. This occurs amidst upregulation of inflammation and suppression of adaptive immunity in this Y lineage, as well as inferior outcomes in human immunodeficiency virus infection. From structural analysis and experimental data, the UTY (Ubiquitously Transcribed Tetratricopeptide Repeat Containing, Y-Linked) gene is emerging as a promising candidate underlying the associations between Y-chromosome variants and the immunity-driven susceptibility to complex disease.

Here, we propose a new classification of diseases (NCD) by developing an algorithm that predicts the additional categories of a disease by integrating multiple networks consisting of disease phenotypes and their molecular profiles. With statistical validations from phenotype-genotype associations and interactome networks, we demonstrate that NCD improves disease specificity owing to its overlapping categories and polyhierarchical structure. Furthermore, NCD captures the molecular diversity of diseases and defines clearer boundaries in terms of both phenotypic similarity and molecular associations, establishing a rational strategy to reform disease taxonomy.","Zhou, Xuezhong; Lei, Lei; Liu, Jun; Halu, Arda; Zhang, Yingying; Li, Bing; Guo, Zhili; Liu, Guangming; Sun, Changkai; Loscalzo, Joseph; Sharma, Amitabh; Wang, Zhong",EBioMedicine,100,17

Over two dozen cases of in-flight transmissions have been documented. To understand these risks, a characterization of the airplane cabin microbiome is necessary. Our study team collected 229 environmental samples on ten transcontinental US flights with subsequent 16S rRNA sequencing. We found that bacterial communities were largely derived from human skin and oral commensals, as well as environmental generalist bacteria. We identified clear signatures for air versus touch surface microbiome, but not for individual types of touch surfaces. We also found large flight-to-flight beta diversity variations with no distinguishing signatures of individual flights, rather a high between-flight diversity for all touch surfaces and particularly for air samples. There was no systematic pattern of microbial community change from pre- to post-flight. Our findings are similar to those of other recent studies of the microbiome of built environments. In summary, the airplane cabin microbiome has immense airplane to airplane variability.

Whether naturally, accidentally or maliciously introduced, the substantial uncertainty surrounding the emergence of novel viruses, specifically where they may come from and how they will spread, demands robust and quantifiably validated outbreak control policies that can be implemented in real time. This work presents a novel mathematical modeling framework that integrates both outbreak dynamics and outbreak control into a decision support tool for mitigating infectious disease pandemics that spread through passenger air travel. An ensemble of border control strategies that exploit properties of the air traffic network structure and expected outbreak behavior are proposed. A stochastic metapopulation epidemic model is developed to evaluate and rank the control strategies based on their effectiveness in reducing the spread of outbreaks. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to illustrate the robustness of the proposed control strategies across a range of outbreak scenarios, and a case study is presented for the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. This study highlights the importance of strategically allocating outbreak control resources, and the results can be used to identify the most robust border control policy that can be implemented in the early stages of an outbreak.","Zlojutro, Aleksa; Rey, David; Gardner, Lauren",Sci Rep,100,1

We characterized phasic ASM contraction in preterm (128 day gestation), term (∼150 day gestation), 1–4 month, 1 yr, and adult sheep (5yr). Spontaneous phasic activity was measured in bronchial segments as amplitude, frequency, and intensity. The mechanism of phasic ASM contraction was investigated further with a computational model of ASM force development and lumen narrowing. The computational model comprised a two-dimensional cylindrical geometry of a network of contractile units and the activation of neighboring cells was dependent on the strength of coupling between cells. As expected, phasic contractions were most prominent in fetal airways and decreased with advancing age, to a level similar to the level in the 1–4 month lambs. Computational predictions demonstrated phasic contraction through the generation of a wave of activation events, the magnitude of which is determined by the number of active cells and the strength of cell–cell interactions. Decreases in phasic contraction with advancing age were simulated by reducing cell–cell coupling. Results show that phasic activity is suppressed rapidly after birth, then sustained at a lower intensity from the preweaning phase until adulthood in an ovine developmental model. Cell–cell coupling is proposed as a key determinant of phasic ASM contraction and if reduced could explain the observed maturational changes.","Wang, Kimberley C. W.; Chang, Amy Y.; Pillow, J.

4060,4060,4060,A Coding Sequence-Embedded Principle Governs Translational Reading Frame Fidelity,13.252202,5.8136353,2018-09-20,"Upon initiation at a start codon, the ribosome must maintain the correct reading frame for hundreds of codons in order to produce functional proteins. While some sequence elements are able to trigger programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), very little is known about how the ribosome normally prevents spontaneous frameshift errors that can have dire consequences if uncorrected. Using high resolution ribosome profiling data sets, we discovered that the translating ribosome uses the 3′ end of 18S rRNA to scan the AUG-like codons after the decoding process. The postdecoding mRNA:rRNA interaction not only contributes to predominant translational pausing, but also provides a retrospective mechanism to safeguard the ribosome in the correct reading frame. Partially eliminating the AUG-like “sticky” codons in the reporter message leads to increased +1 frameshift errors. Remarkably, mutating the highly conserved CAU triplet of 18S rRNA globally changes the codon “stickiness”. Further supporting the role of “sticky” sequences in reading frame maintenance, the codon composition of open reading frames is highly optimized across eukaryotic genomes. These results suggest an important layer of information embedded within the protein-coding sequences that instructs the ribosome to ensure reading frame fidelity during translation.","Wan, Ji; Gao, Xiangwei; Mao, Yuanhui; Zhang, Xingqian; Qian, Shu-Bing",Research (Wash D C),100,1

In this paper we describe the first real-time syndromic surveillance system that conducts integrated spatio-temporal analysis of data from a national network of veterinary premises for the early detection of disease outbreaks in small animals. We illustrate the system’s performance using data relating to gastrointestinal disease in dogs and cats. The data consist of approximately one million electronic health records for dogs and cats, collected from 458 UK veterinary premises between March 2014 and 2016. For this illustration, the system predicts the relative reporting rate of gastrointestinal disease amongst all presentations, and updates its predictions as new data accrue. The system was able to detect simulated outbreaks of varying spatial geometry, extent and severity. The system is flexible: it generates outcomes that are easily interpretable; the user can set their own outbreak detection thresholds. The system provides the foundation for prompt detection and control of health threats in companion animals.","Hale, Alison C.; Sánchez-Vizcaíno, Fernando; Rowlingson, Barry; Radford, Alan D.; Giorgi, Emanuele; O’Brien, Sarah J.; Diggle, Peter J.",Sci Rep,100,1

Flaviviruses, which contain RNA as their genetic material, are one of the most pathogenic families of viruses. There is an increasing amount of evidence suggesting that their 5’ and 3’ non-coding terminal regions are critical for their survival. Information on their structural features is essential to gain detailed insights into their functions and interactions with host proteins. In this study, the 5’ and 3’ terminal regions of Murray Valley encephalitis virus and Powassan virus were examined using biophysical and computational modeling methods. First, we used size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifuge methods to investigate the purity of in-vitro transcribed RNAs. Next, we employed small-angle X-ray scattering techniques to study solution conformation and low-resolution structures of these RNAs, which suggest that the 3’ terminal regions are highly extended as compared to the 5’ terminal regions for both viruses. Using computational modeling tools, we reconstructed 3-dimensional structures of each RNA fragment and compared them with derived small-angle X-ray scattering low-resolution structures. This approach allowed us to reinforce that the 5’ terminal regions adopt more dynamic structures compared to the mainly double-stranded structures of the 3’ terminal regions.","Mrozowich, Tyler; Henrickson, Amy; Demeler, Borries; Patel, Trushar R",Viruses,100,1

In the past, hepatitis A and E were the most frequently observed drinking- water-borne viral infections, but in recent years several small- and large-scale norovirus epidemics have been described, even in Europe. All virus species spread via drinking water are of fecal origin. They are regularly identified in waste water even after conventional multi-stage water treatment. The approved disinfection methods can cope with these viruses if they are not integrated in larger particles. For this reason particle separation is particularly important in water treatment. Virological tests are not reliable enough to ensure that drinking water is sufficiently virus-free. The examination of 100 mL of water for E. coli and coliform bacteria is not adequate proof either. If potentially contaminated raw water is used, consumer safety must be ensured by calculating the performance of water treatment plants on a case-by-case basis. Such a calculation takes into account the virus load of the raw water, the efficiency of the physical and chemical particle elimination steps and the effect of disinfection. Those factors which determine the effectiveness of disinfection, namely concentration and exposure time or UV radiation strength, must be adjusted according to the risk of viral infection, and calculated settings must be adhered to, even if favorable E. coli levels may make them seem excessive.","Botzenhart, K.",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,100,1

Frequent viral ENT infections, as well as numerous bacterial infections, should not be treated with antibiotics. Due to the current antibiotic sensitivity of the main ENT pathogens, the antibiotic choice for an empiric therapy is emphasized, and also the advantage of an optimized therapy based on the results of Gram stain (supercalculated empiric therapy) and an antibiogram (specific therapy). Pus characteristics may be the first step in diagnosing the pathogens. The degree of severity of an infection determines the oral or parenteral route of administration. As a rule, antibiotic therapy has to be checked after 2–3 days. The grouping of the different ENT infections with a similar spectrum of pathogens gives a better view of the therapeutic principles and reduces repetitions. The current recommendations for antibiotic treatment of numerous ENT infections with different degrees of severity are indicated. After the presentation of the appropriate antibiotics with their current spectrum of efficacy, the initial therapy, treatment in case of penicillin allergy, and of severe cases and complications or therapeutic failure are mentioned.","Federspil, P.; Federspil, P.

In this paper, we develop an extended CA simulation model to study the dynamical behaviors of HIV/AIDS transmission. The model incorporates heterogeneity into agents’ behaviors. Agents have various attributes such as infectivity and susceptibility, varying degrees of influence on their neighbors and different mobilities. Additional, we divide the post-infection process of AIDS disease into several sub-stages in order to facilitate the study of the dynamics in different development stages of epidemics. These features make the dynamics more complicated. We find that the epidemic in our model can generally end up in one of the two states: extinction and persistence, which is consistent with other researchers’ work. Higher population density, higher mobility, higher number of infection source, and greater neighborhood are more likely to result in high levels of infections and in persistence. Finally, we show in four-class agent scenario, variation in susceptibility (or infectivity) and various fractions of four classes also complicates the dynamics, and some of the results are contradictory and needed for further research.","Xuan, Huiyu; Xu, Lida; Li, Lu",Ann Oper Res,100,1

In the absence of a likely or certain influenza diagnosis, ion channel inhibitors or neuramindase inhibitors have lower effectiveness, and symptom relief becomes the rationale for treatment of influenza-like illness. Because both influenza and influenzalike illness are self-limiting, safety of interventions is paramount, especially in children.

Regardless of the cause of the hepatic disease, weight loss, anorexia, dullness and depression were consistent features. Signs of hepatic encephalopathy, such as blindness, head pressing, excitability, ataxia and weakness were less common and, together with pyrexia and jaundice, were grave prognostic signs. Plasma ammonia concentrations were significantly elevated compared to clinically normal cattle, but such changes were not always accompanied by a decline in plasma urea concentrations. In normal, healthy cattle, the plasma ammonia:urea concentration ratio is 9:1 and the plasma ammonia:glucose concentration is 11:1. In hepatic disease, a plasma ammonia:glucose ratio >40:1 or plasma ammonia:urea ratio >30:1, particularly with a rising total ketone body concentration and a declining glucose concentration, carried a guarded prognosis. The study suggested that other factors, such as hypokalaemia, alkalosis, short-chain volatile fatty acids, and false and true neuro-transmitters, may be important in the pathogenesis of hepatic coma in cattle.","West, H.J.",Vet Res Commun,100,1

There are several risks during the production and delivery stages of this technology, with potential impact on the environment and on human health. Risks to the environment include gene transfer and exposure to antigens or selectable marker proteins. Risks to human health include oral tolerance, allergenicity, inconsistent dosage, worker exposure and unintended exposure to antigens or selectable marker proteins in the food chain. These risks are controllable through appropriate regulatory measures at all stages of production and distribution of a potential plant-made vaccine. Successful use of this technology is highly dependant on stewardship and active risk management by the developers of this technology, and through quality standards for production, which will be set by regulatory agencies. Regulatory agencies can also negatively affect the future viability of this technology by requiring that all risks must be controlled, or by applying conventional regulations which are overly cumbersome for a plant production and oral delivery system. The value of new or replacement vaccines produced in plant cells and delivered orally must be considered alongside the probability and severity of potential risks in their production and use, and the cost of not deploying this technology – the risk of continuing with the status quo alternative.","Kirk, Dwayne D.; McIntosh, Kim; Walmsley, Amanda M; Peterson, Robert K.

Thirty-five patients enrolled in this multi-institutional phase I/II trial received up to eight arterial infusions of up to 2 × 10(12) viral particles. Hepatic toxicity was the primary dose-limiting toxicity observed in preclinical models. However, nearly 200 infusions of this adenoviral vector were administered directly into the hepatic artery without significant toxicity. Therefore, we undertook this analysis to determine the impact of repeated adenoviral exposure on hepatic function. Seventeen patients were treated at our institution, providing a detailed data set on the changes in hepatic function following repeated exposure to adenovirus. No changes in hepatic function occurred with the first treatment of Onyx-015 among these patients. Transient increases in transaminase levels occurred in one patient starting with the second infusion and transient increases in bilirubin was observed in two patients starting with the fifth treatment. These changes occurred too early to be explained by viral-mediated lysis of hepatocytes. In addition, viremia was observed starting 3–5 days after the viral infusion in half of the patient, but was not associated with hepatic toxicity. To further understand the basis for the minimal hepatic toxicity of adenoviral vectors, we evaluated the replication of adenovirus in primary hepatocytes and tumor cells in culture and the expression of the coxsackie-adenoviral receptor (CAR) in normal liver and colon cancer metastatic to the liver. We found that adenovirus replicates poorly in primary hepatocytes but replicates efficiently in tumors including tumors derived from hepatocytes. In addition, we found that CAR is localized at junctions between hepatocytes and is inaccessible to hepatic blood flow. CAR is not expressed on tumor vasculature but is expressed on tumor cells. Spatial restriction of CAR to the intercellular space in normal liver and diminished replication of adenovirus in hepatocytes may explain the minimal toxicity observed following repeated hepatic artery infusions with Onyx-015.","Au, T; Thorne, S; Korn, W M; Sze, D; Kirn, D; Reid, T R",Cancer Gene Ther,100,1

They would aim to protect globally against pandemic influenza viruses that have not yet evolved. Thus they differ from seasonal vaccines to influenza virus, which are updated annually in spring to incorporate the latest circulating viruses, and are then produced and delivered before the peak influenza season starts in late fall and winter. The efficacy of seasonal vaccines is linked to their ability to induce virus-neutralizing antibodies, which provide subtype-specific protection against influenza A viruses. If pandemic vaccines were designed to resemble current vaccines in terms of composition and mode of action, they would have to be developed, tested, and mass-produced after the onset of a pandemic, once the causative virus had been identified. The logistic problems of generating a pandemic vaccine from scratch, conducting preclinical testing, and producing billions of doses within a few months for global distribution are enormous and may well be insurmountable.

Both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) can currently be used together with real time detection to generate results in a short turn-around time and to determine whether variants relevant for antiviral resistance are present. These new technologies enable the introduction of an individual patient disease management concept. Within our clinical setting, we have introduced this e.g. for quantitative detection of Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV) in T-dell depleted allogeneic stem cell transplant patients. This enabled us to develop models for pre-emptive anti B-cell immunotherapy for EBV reactivation, thereby effectively reducing not the incidence of EBV-lymphoproliferative disease but the virus related mortality. Furthermore, additional clinically relevant viruses can now easily be detected simultaneously. It also becomes more feasible to introduce molecular testing for those viruses that can easily be detected using classical virological methods, like culture techniques or antigen detection. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate the clinical importance of the additional positive samples detected. It should however be made clear that a complete exchange of technologies is unlikely to occur, and that some complementary technologies should stay operational enabling the discovery of new viruses. The implementation of these molecular diagnostic technologies furthermore warrants the use and introduction of standardized materials as well as participation in international quality control programs. Finally, the use of an internal control throughout the whole procedure not only ensures the accuracy of the results generated, but also is necessary to enable precise quantification of these results and to determine detection thresholds more accurately. Since so many targets do have clinical implications, laboratories might prefer to use universal internal controls before the in-house developed assays should be introduced in clinical virology.","Niesters, Hubert G.M",J Clin Virol,100,1

The affected pigs had antibody against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The predominant lung lesions were severe proliferative and interstitial pneumonia, and slight suppurative bronchopneumonia. The lesions were closely associated with the sites at which PRRSV and Mycoplasma hyorhinis antigens were detected. Four of five pigs inoculated with PRRSV developed slight pneumonitis. The fifth animal, which died of severe pneumonitis, yielded a heavy culture of M. hyorhinis. These findings demonstrate that dual infection with M. hyorhinis and PRRSV caused severe pulmonary lesions.","Kawashima, K.; Yamada, S.; Kobayashi, H.; Narita, M.",J Comp Pathol,100,1

Five of six prepubertal colts inoculated intranasally remained infected in the reproductive tract from post-challenge day 28 to 93 and two of six from post-challenge day 120 to 180. No virus was detected in five of these animals killed on post-challenge day 210. Each of two peripubertal colts remained infected in the reproductive tract at post-challenge day 60 and one of nine was found to be persistently infected with EAV 15 months after challenge. These findings confirm that the virus can replicate in the reproductive tract of a significant proportion of colts for a variable period of time after clinical recovery in the absence of circulating concentrations of testosterone equivalent to those found in sexually mature stallions. Long-term persistent infection with EAV does not appear to occur in colts exposed to the virus before the onset of peripubertal development. We suggest that colts should be vaccinated at approximately 6 months of age, before peripubertal development but after the disappearance of maternally acquired antibodies.","Holyoak, G.R.; Little, T.V.; McCollum, W.H.; Timoney, P.J.",J Comp Pathol,100,17

However, contradictory results have also been presented, and the mechanistic explanation is lacking. Methods: A panel of cell lines (Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK), adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549), lung epithelial type I (LET1)) and primary human airway epithelial cells (HAE) susceptible to influenza virus infection were infected with a seasonal influenza A virus in the presence or absence of BBR. Cytotoxicity towards cell lines was measured using XTT assay. The yield of the virus was analyzed using RT-qPCR. To study the molecular mechanism of BBR, confocal microscopy and Western blot analyses of cellular fractions were applied. Results and conclusions: Our results show cell-type-dependent anti-influenza properties of BBR in vitro which suggests that the compound acts on the cell and not the virus. Importantly, BBR hampers influenza replication in primary human airway epithelium 3D cultures that mimic the natural replication site of the virus. Studies show that the influenza A virus upregulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway and hijacks this pathway for nucleolar export of the viral ribonucleoprotein. Our results suggest that BBR interferes with this process and hampers influenza A replication.","Botwina, Paweł; Owczarek, Katarzyna; Rajfur, Zenon; Ochman, Marek; Urlik, Maciej; Nowakowska, Maria; Szczubiałka, Krzysztof; Pyrc, Krzysztof",Viruses,100,1

Polylactic acid (PLA) for 3D printing is widely available and biocompatible, but there is a gap in knowledge concerning its compatibility with chemical disinfectants. In this study, 3D-printed PLA tensile samples were created with six different printer settings. Each of these six batches consisted of five sets with five or six samples. The first set remained untreated, the others were soaked in Cidex OPA or in a chlorine solution. These were applied for seven consecutive days or in 25 short cycles. All samples were weighed before and after treatment and subjected to a tensile test. Results showed that a third of the treatments led to an increase of the median weight with a maximum of 8.3%, however, the samples with the best surface quality did not change. The median strength increase was 12.5% and the largest decrease was 8.8%. The median stiffness decreased 3.6% in one set and increased in three others up to 13.6%. When 3D printing PLA medical tools, surface porosity must be minimized to prevent transfer of disinfectants to people. The wide variability of mechanical properties due to 3D printing itself and as a consequence of disinfection must be considered when designing medical tools by selecting appropriate printer settings. If these conditions are met, reusing 3D-printed PLA medical tools seems safe from a mechanical point of view.","Fleischer, Julie C.; Diehl, Jan C.; Wauben, Linda S. G.

There is evidence to suggest that the vimentin framework plays an important role in mediating smooth muscle mechanical properties such as tension and contractile responses. Contractile activation induces vimentin phosphorylation at Ser-56 and vimentin network reorientation, facilitating contractile force transmission among and within smooth muscle cells. p21-activated kinase 1 and polo-like kinase 1 catalyze vimentin phosphorylation at Ser-56, whereas type 1 protein phosphatase dephosphorylates vimentin at this residue. Vimentin filaments are also involved in other cell functions including migration and nuclear positioning.

Morphological examination of these species has defined six phenotypic groups that are commonly used in characterizations of taxonomic hypotheses. We used a molecular phylogeny based on four mitochondrial and two nuclear genes to assess the group's biogeographical history in the archipelago and examine the phylogenetic validity of the currently recognized Philippine species groups. We re‐examined traditional characters used to define species groups and used multivariate statistics to quantitatively evaluate group structure in morphometric space. Clustering analyses of phenotypic similarity indicate that some (but not all) members of previously defined species groups are phenotypically most similar to other members of the same group. However, when species group membership was mapped on our partitioned Bayesian phylogenetic hypothesis, only one species group corresponds to a clade; all other species group arrangements are strongly rejected by our phylogeny. Our results demonstrate that (1) previously recognized species group relationships were misled by phenotypic convergence; (2) Sphenomorphus is widely paraphyletic; and (3) multiple lineages have independently invaded the Philippines. Based on this new perspective on the phylogenetic relationships of Philippine Sphenomorphus, we revise the archipelago's diverse assemblage of species at the generic level, and resurrect and/or expand four previously recognized genera, and describe two new genera to accommodate the diversity of Philippine skinks of the Sphenomorphus group. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2011, 163, 1217–1243.","LINKEM, CHARLES W.; DIESMOS, ARVIN C.; BROWN, RAFE M.",Zool J Linn Soc,100,1

The pathogenesis of MS is believed to be due to an immunologic response in a genetically predisposed individual, localized within the central nervous system white matter, and triggered by exposure to an environmental agent such as a virus. Based on our personal experience we find that the efficacy of IFN therapy is hampered in MS patients by the presence of an interferon inhibitor factor (IIF) in the patients' sera which we have isolated and characterized. When plasmapheresis (PP) was done on 24 MS patients with intermittent 3‐day administration of IFN‐a and human leukocyte IFN, marked increase of IFN in 18 patients and modest increase in three patients correlated with clinical improvement. Three clinical nonresponders showed no increase in IFN levels following therapy. The ability to remove IIF and lymphokine inhibitor factor (LIF) by PP may explain the successful treatment of our patients. We describe the evaluation of helper T cells, suppressor T cells, HLADR antigen, natural killer cells, and monocyte/macrophage cell populations by flow cytometry before and after PP. A significant increase in these immune‐competent cells correlated with marked improvement in Kurtzke disability status scale in 13 patients, while eight stabilized. Patients showing progression of the disease either showed decrease or no change in these parameters after therapy. Encouraging results from this pilot study suggest that PP combined with immunomodulatory regimens of IFN may be an effective therapy for MS.","Medenica, Rajko D.; Mukerjee, Sonjoy; Alonso, Kenneth; Lazovic, Gavrilo; Huschart, Teresa",J Clin Apher,100,8

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to analyze the outcomes of the elderly compared to nonelderly undergoing CAWR using propensity score matching. METHODS: All patients who underwent CAWR using porcine-derived, non-crosslinked acellular dermal matrix (ADM) (Strattice™) between January 2014 and July 2017 were studied retrospectively. Propensity matched analysis was performed for risk adjustment in multivariable analysis and for one-to-one matching. The outcomes were analyzed for differences in postoperative complications, reoperations, mortality, hospital length of stay and adverse discharge disposition. RESULTS: One hundred-thirty-six patients were identified during the study period.

This includes the evaluation when patients are referred for rehabilitation services and the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions across the cancer continuum. RECENT FINDINGS: Although prognosticating life expectancy is difficult, referrals for rehabilitation interventions appear to be affected by physician attitudes towards patients with advanced disease, in part because of misconceptions about the nature of rehabilitation for oncology patients. Rehabilitation may also be underutilized in long-term survivors with no evidence of disease. Despite this, our review found that rehabilitation in advanced disease, end-of-life, geriatric cancer patients, and in long-term survivors can be beneficial. There is a relative dearth in studies on rehabilitation interventions specifically at the end-of-life. SUMMARY: Cancer rehabilitation can be helpful to patients along the spectrum of cancer prognoses. Examining more accurate ways to prognosticate life expectancy, improving communication and education between oncologists and rehabilitation team members, and modifying survivorship plans to include patient education on functional changes over time may improve the delivery of rehabilitation care.","Smith, Sean Robinson; Zheng, Jasmine Yiqian",Curr Phys Med Rehabil Rep,100,1
12593,12593,12593,Response to Trevisson et al.,13.709967,5.8256836,2015-04-02,"INTRODUCTION: The Indian national Civil Registration System (CRS) is the optimal data source for subnational mortality measurement, but is yet under development. As an alternative, data from the Sample Registration System (SRS), which covers less than 1% of the national population, is used. This article presents a comparison of mortality measures from the SRS and CRS in 2017, and explores the potential of the CRS to meet these subnational data needs. METHODS: Data on population and deaths by age and sex for 2017 from each source were used to compute national-level and state-level life tables. Sex-specific ratios of death probabilities in five age categories (0–4, 5–14, 15–29, 30–69, 70–84) were used to evaluate CRS data completeness using SRS probabilities as reference values. The quality of medically certified causes of death was assessed through hospital reporting coverage and proportions of deaths registered with ill-defined causes from each state. RESULTS: The CRS operates through an extensive infrastructure with high reporting coverage, but child deaths are uniformly under-reported, as are female deaths in many states. However, at ages 30–69 years, CRS death probabilities are higher than the SRS values in 15 states for males and 10 states for females. SRS death probabilities are of limited precision for measuring mortality trends and differentials. Data on medically certified causes of death are of limited use due to low hospital reporting coverage. CONCLUSIONS: The Indian CRS is more reliable than the SRS for measuring adult mortality in several states. Targeted initiatives to improve the recording of child and female deaths, to strengthen the reporting and quality of medically certified causes of death, and to promote use of verbal autopsy methods can establish the CRS as a reliable source of subnational mortality statistics in the near future.","Rao, Chalapati; Gupta, Mamta",BMJ Glob Health,100,22

Our previous study shows that prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) reduces the apoptosis of renal tubular cells in DKD rats. But its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study we investigated the protective effects of PGE1 in DKD rats and high glucose (HG, 30 mM)-treated HK-2 proximal tubular cells. Four weeks after uninephrectomized streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were established, the DKD rats were administered PGE1 (10 µg· kg(−1)· d(−1), iv.) for 10 consecutive days. We showed that PGE1 administration did not change blood glucose levels, but alleviated diabetic kidney injury in the DKD rats, evidenced by markedly reduced proteinuria and renal tubular apoptosis. In the in vitro experiments, PGE1 (0.1–100 µM) significantly enhanced HG-reduced HK-2 cell viability. In HG-treated HK-2 cells, PGE1 (10 µM) significantly suppressed the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the mitochondrial apoptosis-related protein expressions such as Bim, Bax, caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3; similar changes were also observed in the kidney of PGE1-treated DKD rats. By using two pharmacological tools-JNK activator anisomycin (AM) and JNK inhibitor SP600125, we revealed that PGE1 blocked HG-triggered activation of JNK/Bim pathway in HK-2 cells; JNK was an upstream regulator of Bim. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the nephroprotective effects of PGE1 against apoptosis of proximal renal tubule in DKD rats via suppressing JNK-related Bim signaling pathway.","Zhang, Yu-han; Zhang, Ya-qin; Guo, Cong-cong; Wang, Li-kang; Cui, Yu-jiao; Dong, Jian-jun; Liao, Lin",Acta Pharmacol Sin,100,1

These recommendations may help service providers across the NHS intending to implement a T&E approach, with the aim of effectively addressing the capacity and resource issues putting strain on UK neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) services while promoting patients’ best interests throughout. METHODS: Two structured roundtable meetings of retinal specialists were held in London, UK on 7 December 2018 and 1 March 2019. These meetings were organised and funded by Bayer. RESULTS: The panel provided recommendations for an aflibercept T&E pathway and developed specific criteria based on visual acuity, retinal morphology and optical coherence tomography imaging to guide reduction, maintenance and extension of injection intervals. They also discussed the extension of treatment intervals by 2- or 4-week adjustments to a maximum treatment interval of 16 weeks, the management of retinal fluid and the stopping of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term benefits of implementing a T&E pathway may include superior visual outcomes compared with a pro re nata (PRN; as needed) protocol, and a lower treatment burden compared with a fixed protocol, which is likely to improve service capacity. Furthermore, the predictable nature of a T&E approach compared with a PRN service may aid capacity planning for the future nAMD treatment demand.","Ross, Adam H.; Downey, Louise; Devonport, Helen; Gale, Richard P.; Kotagiri, Ajay; Mahmood, Sajjad; Mehta, Hemal; Narendran, Niro; Patel, Praveen J.; Parmar, Nina; Jain, Nitin",Eye (Lond),100,1

In the present study, the protective effects of GAS on H9c2 cells against ischemia–reperfusion (IR)-like injury were found to be related to decreasing of oxidative stress. Furthermore, GAS could protect H9c2 cells against oxidative injury induced by H(2)O(2). Pretreatment of GAS at 20, 50, and 100 μM for 4 h significantly ameliorated the decrease in cell viability and increase in apoptosis of H9c2 cells treated with 400 μM H(2)O(2) for 3 h. Furthermore, we showed that H(2)O(2) treatment induced fragmentation of mitochondria and significant reduction in networks, footprint, and tubular length of mitochondria; H(2)O(2) treatment strongly inhibited mitochondrial respiration; H(2)O(2) treatment induced a decrease in the expression of mitochondrial fusion factors Mfn2 and Opa1, and increase in the expression of mitochondrial fission factor Fis1. All these alterations in H(2)O(2)-treated H9c2 cells could be ameliorated by GAS pretreatment. Moreover, we revealed that GAS pretreatment enhanced the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 under H(2)O(2) treatment. Knockdown of Nrf2 expression abolished the protective effects of GAS on H(2)O(2)-treated H9c2 cells. Our results suggest that GAS may protect H9c2 cardiomycytes against oxidative injury via increasing the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, regulating mitochondrial dynamics, and maintaining the structure and functions of mitochondria.","Cheng, Qiao-qiao; Wan, Yu-wei; Yang, Wei-min; Tian, Meng-hua; Wang, Yu-chuan; He, Hai-yan; Zhang, Wei-dong; Liu, Xuan",Acta Pharmacol Sin,100,1

Using genetically modified mouse models (GEMMs), we demonstrate that Wnt signaling promotes c-Fos-induced OS formation via the actions of the collagen-modifying enzyme Loxl2. c-Fos/AP-1 directly regulates the expression of the Wnt ligands Wnt7b and Wnt9a in OS cells through promoter binding, and Wnt7b and Wnt9a in turn promote Loxl2 expression in murine and human OS cells through the transcription factors Zeb1 and Zeb2. Concordantly, inhibition of Wnt ligand secretion by inactivating the Wnt-less (Wls) gene in osteoblasts in c-Fos GEMMs either early or in a therapeutic setting reduces Loxl2 expression and progression of OS. Wls-deficient osteosarcomas proliferate less, are less mineralized and are enriched in fibroblastic cells surrounded by collagen fibers. Importantly, Loxl2 inhibition using either the pan-Lox inhibitor BAPN or a specific inducible shRNA reduces OS cell proliferation in vitro and decreases tumor growth and lung colonization in murine and human orthotopic OS transplantation models. Finally, OS development is delayed in c-Fos GEMMs treated with BAPN or with specific Loxl2 blocking antibodies. Congruently, a strong correlation between c-FOS, LOXL2 and WNT7B/WNT9A expression is observed in human OS samples, and c-FOS/LOXL2 co-expression correlates with OS aggressiveness and decreased patient survival. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of Wnt and/or Loxl2 should be considered to potentiate the inadequate current treatments for pediatric, recurrent, and metastatic OS.","Matsuoka, Kazuhiko; Bakiri, Latifa; Wolff, Lena I.; Linder, Markus; Mikels-Vigdal, Amanda; Patiño-García, Ana; Lecanda, Fernando; Hartmann, Christine; Sibilia, Maria; Wagner, Erwin F.",Cell Res,100,1

So far, no studies have reported how Portuguese families deal with information about HD, from a transgenerational perspective. This qualitative study aims to fill in that gap, and focuses on how families acquire knowledge about HD and management of information within the family and in their social relationships. The study adopted semi-structured interviews with 10 participants from HD families. Interviews were transcribed and analysed thematically. Findings suggested that management of information in the family started with the search for a diagnosis in an affected family member. Diagnosis led to a process of “making sense of HD in the family”, which activated a transgenerational process to understand HD in the family context, marked by improved awareness and different ways family members manage it (closedness and openness). These results should be relevant for health-care professionals, bringing further insight into the process of acquiring knowledge about HD, and highlighting the relevance of continued efforts for enhanced pre- and post-test counselling and ongoing support to the HD families.","Oliveira, Carla Roma; Mendes, Álvaro; Sequeiros, Jorge; Sousa, Liliana",Eur J Hum Genet,100,1

As matrix components are costly to produce and shared within the population, EPS-deficient cells can act as cheaters by gaining benefits from the cooperative nature of EPS producers. Remarkably, genetically programmed EPS producers can also exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity at single-cell level. Previous studies have shown that spatial structure of biofilms limits the spread of cheaters, but the long-term influence of cheating on biofilm evolution is not well understood. Here, we examine the influence of EPS nonproducers on evolution of matrix production within the populations of EPS producers in a model biofilm-forming bacterium, Bacillus subtilis. We discovered that general adaptation to biofilm lifestyle leads to an increase in phenotypical heterogeneity of eps expression. However, prolonged exposure to EPS-deficient cheaters may result in different adaptive strategy, where eps expression increases uniformly within the population. We propose a molecular mechanism behind such adaptive strategy and demonstrate how it can benefit the EPS producers in the presence of cheaters. This study provides additional insights on how biofilms adapt and respond to stress caused by exploitation in long-term scenario.","Martin, Marivic; Dragoš, Anna; Otto, Simon B.; Schäfer, Daniel; Brix, Susanne; Maróti, Gergely; Kovács, Ákos T.",ISME J,100,17

We tested three commonly used metrics to evaluate the extent of phylosymbiosis: (a) intraspecific versus interspecific microbiome variation, (b) topological comparisons between host phylogeny and hierarchical clustering (dendrogram) of host-associated microbial communities, and (c) correlation of host phylogenetic distance with microbial community dissimilarity. In all instances, intraspecific variation in microbiome composition was significantly lower than interspecific variation. Similarly, topological congruency between host phylogeny and the associated microbial dendrogram was more significant than would be expected by chance across all groups, except when using unweighted UniFrac distance (compared with weighted UniFrac and Bray–Curtis dissimilarity). Interestingly, all but the ascidians showed a significant positive correlation between host phylogenetic distance and associated microbial dissimilarity.

Moreover, a growing body of literature highlights the importance of neuropeptides in the PFC to modulate neural signaling and to influence behavior. The converging evidence outlined in this review indicates that neuropeptides in the PFC are specifically impacted by stress, and are found to be dysregulated in numerous stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders including substance use disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), posttraumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia. This review explores how neuropeptides in the PFC function to regulate the neural activity, and how genetic and environmental factors, such as stress, lead to dysregulation in neuropeptide systems, which may ultimately contribute to the pathology of neuropsychiatric diseases.","Brockway, Dakota F.; Crowley, Nicole A.",Front Behav Neurosci,100,1

Neurodevelopmental expression of ZDHHC14 mirrors that of PSD93 and Kv1 channels and, consistent with ZDHHC14’s importance for Kv1 channel clustering, loss of ZDHHC14 decreases outward currents and increases action potential firing in hippocampal neurons.

PTSD can be chronic and debilitating, and is associated with co-morbidities such as depression, substance use, and cardiometabolic disorders. One of the most important pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of PTSD and its subsequent maintenance is a dysfunctional hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. The corticotrophin-releasing hormone, cortisol, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and their respective genes are some of the mediators of PTSD’s pathophysiology. Several treatments are available, including medication and psychotherapies, although their success rate is limited. Some pharmacological therapies based on the HPA axis are currently being tested in clinical trials and changes in HPA axis biomarkers have been found to occur in response not only to pharmacological treatments, but also to psychotherapy—including the epigenetic modification of the GR gene.

14811,14811,14811,Letter From The Editors-In-Chief,13.71321,5.811432,2020-08-10,"BACKGROUND: Prevention of neurodevelopmental impairment due to preterm birth is a major health challenge. Despite advanced obstetric and neonatal care, to date there are few neuroprotective molecules available. Melatonin has been shown to have anti-oxidant/anti-inflammatory effects and to reduce brain damage, mainly after hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. The planned study will be the first aiming to evaluate the capacity of melatonin to mitigate brain impairment due to premature birth. METHOD: In our planned prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized vs placebo study, we will recruit, within 96 h of birth, 60 preterm newborns with a gestational age ≤ 29 weeks + 6 days; these infants will be randomly allocated to oral melatonin, 3 mg/kg/day, or placebo for 15 days. After the administration period, we will measure plasma levels of malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation product considered an early biological marker of melatonin treatment efficacy (primary outcome). At term-equivalent age, we will evaluate neurological status (through cerebral ultrasound, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, vision and hearing evaluations, clinical neurological assessment, and screening for retinopathy of prematurity) as well as the incidence of bronchodysplasia and sepsis. We will also monitor neurodevelopmental outcome during the first 24 months of corrected age (using the modified Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence at 4–6 months and standardized neurological and developmental assessments at 24 months). DISCUSSION: Preterm birth survivors often present long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae, such as motor, learning, social-behavioral, and communication problems. We aim to assess the role of melatonin as a neuroprotectant during the first weeks of extrauterine life, when preterm infants are unable to produce it spontaneously. This approach is based on the supposition that its anti-oxidant mechanism could be useful in preventing neurodevelopmental impairment. Considering the short- and long-term morbidities related to preterm birth, and the financial and social costs of the care of preterm infants, both at birth and over time, we suggest that melatonin administration could lead to considerable saving of resources. This would be the first study addressing the role of melatonin in very low birth weight preterm newborns, and it could provide a basis for further studies on melatonin as a neuroprotection strategy in this vulnerable population.

To address this in a scalable way, we sought to develop a web tool that could help enhance underserved minority participation in clinical research. METHODS: We used our research literacy support flashcard tool as the initial prototype for human-centered design and usability testing of the web tool Health for All in public library settings. After forming partnerships with leadership from Chicago Public Libraries (CPL), local medical libraries, and the Chicago Department of Public Health, we conducted seven iterative design sessions with focus groups of library patrons and library staff from six CPL branches serving underserved communities followed by two rounds of usability testing and website modification. RESULTS: Based on the qualitative research findings from Design Sessions 1–7, we enacted the design decision of a website that was a hybrid of fact-filled and vignette (personal stories) paper prototypes divided into 4 modules (trust, diversity, healthy volunteers, pros/cons), each with their own outcome metrics. The website was thus constructed, and navigation issues identified in two rounds of usability testing by library patrons were addressed through further website modification, followed by the launch of a beta version of a hybridized single-scrolling and guided module prototype to allow further development with website analytics. CONCLUSIONS: We report the development of Health for All, a website designed to enhance racial/ethnic minority participation in clinical trials by imparting research literacy, mitigating distrust engendered by longstanding racism and discrimination, and providing connections to clinical trials recruiting participants.","Simon, Melissa A.; O’Brian, Catherine A.; Tom, Laura; Wafford, Q.

Several epidemics including East Africa have occurred, but there are no descriptions of longitudinal surveillance of endemic disease. Here, we estimate the incidence of CHIKF in coastal Kenya and describe the associated viral phylogeny. METHODS: We monitored acute febrile illnesses among 3500 children visiting two primary healthcare facilities in coastal Kenya over a 5-year period (2014–2018). Episodes were linked to a demographic surveillance system and blood samples obtained. Cross-sectional sampling in a community survey of a different group of 435 asymptomatic children in the same study location was done in 2016. Reverse-transcriptase PCR was used for chikungunya virus (CHIKV) screening, and viral genomes sequenced for phylogenetic analyses. RESULTS: We found CHIKF to be endemic in this setting, associated with 12.7% (95% CI 11.60, 13.80) of all febrile presentations to primary healthcare. The prevalence of CHIKV infections among asymptomatic children in the community survey was 0.7% (95% CI 0.22, 2.12). CHIKF incidence among children < 1 year of age was 1190 cases/100,000-person years and 63 cases/100,000-person years among children aged ≥10 years. Recurrent CHIKF episodes, associated with fever and viraemia, were observed among 19 of 170 children with multiple febrile episodes during the study period. All sequenced viral genomes mapped to the ECSA genotype albeit distinct from CHIKV strains associated with the 2004 East African epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: CHIKF may be a substantial public health burden in primary healthcare on the East African coast outside epidemic years, and recurrent infections are common.

Striking racial disparities in pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality rates exist nationally and in Florida, with higher rates among African Americans compared to other racial groups. Biological reasons for these disparities remain unexplained, primarily because most pancreatic cancer research has relied on biospecimens and data from Non-Hispanic Whites. Multidisciplinary teams from fifteen hospitals throughout the state of Florida have partnered together and with patients newly-diagnosed with pancreatic cancer to build the first state-wide biobanking infrastructure we know of that is dedicated to reducing the disproportionate burden of pancreatic cancer affecting African Americans. We describe important information on ascertainment and recruitment strategies and standard operating procedures developed to collect, process, store, and transfer biospecimens, medical images, and data from a diverse cohort of participants. The infrastructure described in this manuscript is intended to serve as a strong foundation for further research into biological, behavioral, socioeconomic, and environmental factors that may contribute to observed disparities and a starting point to develop interventions to tackle these factors. This multi-institutional infrastructure can serve as a prototype for the development of similar resources across the country and disease sites. ABSTRACT: Background: Well-annotated, high-quality biorepositories provide a valuable platform to support translational research. However, most biorepositories have poor representation of minority groups, limiting the ability to address health disparities. Methods: We describe the establishment of the Florida Pancreas Collaborative (FPC), the first state-wide prospective cohort study and biorepository designed to address the higher burden of pancreatic cancer (PaCa) in African Americans (AA) compared to Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) and Hispanic/Latinx (H/L). We provide an overview of stakeholders; study eligibility and design; recruitment strategies; standard operating procedures to collect, process, store, and transfer biospecimens, medical images, and data; our cloud-based data management platform; and progress regarding recruitment and biobanking. Results: The FPC consists of multidisciplinary teams from fifteen Florida medical institutions. From March 2019 through August 2020, 350 patients were assessed for eligibility, 323 met inclusion/exclusion criteria, and 305 (94%) enrolled, including 228 NHW, 30 AA, and 47 H/L, with 94%, 100%, and 94% participation rates, respectively. A high percentage of participants have donated blood (87%), pancreatic tumor tissue (41%), computed tomography scans (76%), and questionnaires (62%). Conclusions: This biorepository addresses a critical gap in PaCa research and has potential to advance translational studies intended to minimize disparities and reduce PaCa-related morbidity and mortality.","Permuth, Jennifer B.; Dezsi, Kaleena B.; Vyas, Shraddha; Ali, Karla N.; Basinski, Toni L.; Utuama, Ovie A.; Denbo, Jason W.; Klapman, Jason; Dam, Aamir; Carballido, Estrella; Kim, Dae Won; Pimiento, Jose M.; Powers, Benjamin D.; Otto, Amy K.; Choi, Jung W.; Chen, Dung-Tsa; Teer, Jamie K.; Beato, Francisca; Ward, Alina; Cortizas, Elena M.; Whisner, Suzanne Y.; Williams, Iverson E.; Riner, Andrea N.; Tardif, Kenneth; Velanovich, Vic; Karachristos, Andreas; Douglas, Wade G.; Legaspi, Adrian; Allan, Bassan J.; Meredith, Kenneth; Molina-Vega, Manual A.; Bao, Philip; St. Julien, Jamii; Huguet, Kevin L.; Green, Lee; Odedina, Folakemi T.; Kumar, Nagi B.; Simmons, Vani N.; George, Thomas J.; Vadaparampil, Susan T.; Hodul, Pamela J.; Arnoletti, J.

Many countries have experienced the periodic emergence of arbovirus diseases. However, information on the prevalence of arboviruses is largely unknown or infrequently updated because of the lack of surveillance studies, especially in Africa. METHODS: A surveillance study was conducted in Gabon, Central Africa, on arboviruses, which are a major public health concern in Africa, including: West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Serological and molecular assays were performed to investigate past infection history and the current status of infection, using serum samples collected from healthy individuals and febrile patients, respectively. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence during 2014˗2017 was estimated to be 25.3% for WNV, 20.4% for DENV, 40.3% for ZIKV, 60.7% for YFV, 61.2% for CHIKV, and 14.3% for RVFV. No significant differences were found in the seroprevalence of any of the viruses between the male and female populations. However, a focus on the mean age in each arbovirus-seropositive individual showed a significantly younger age in WNV- and DENV-seropositive individuals than in CHIKV-seropositive individuals, indicating that WNV and DENV caused a relatively recent epidemic in the region, whereas CHIKV had actively circulated before. Of note, this indication was supported by the detection of both WNV and DENV genomes in serum samples collected from febrile patients after 2016. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the recent re-emergence of WNV and DENV in Gabon as well as the latest seroprevalence state of the major arboviruses, which indicated the different potential risks of virus infections and virus-specific circulation patterns. This information will be helpful for public health organizations and will enable a rapid response towards these arbovirus infections, thereby preventing future spread in the country.

16351,16351,16351,One year on,13.654876,6.1162066,2021-03-26,"ABSTRACT: Many cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection in humans have been reported since its first emergence in 2013. The disease is of concern because most patients have become severely ill with roughly 30% mortality rate. Because the threat in public health caused by H7N9 virus remains high, advance preparedness is essentially needed. In this study, the recombinant H7N9 hemagglutinin (HA) was expressed in insect cells and purified for generation of two monoclonal antibodies, named F3-2 and 1C6B. F3-2 can only recognize the H7N9 HA without having cross-reactivity with HA proteins of H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, and H7N7. 1C6B has the similar specificity with F3-2, but 1C6B can also bind to H7N7 HA. The binding epitope of F3-2 is mainly located in the region of H7N9 HA(299–307). The binding epitope of 1C6B is located in the region of H7N9 HA(489–506). F3-2 and 1C6B could not effectively inhibit the hemagglutination activity of H7N9 HA. However, F3-2 can prevent H7N9 HA from trypsin cleavage and can bind to H7N9 HA which has undergone pH-induced conformational change. F3-2 also has the ability of binding to H7N9 viral particles and inhibiting H7N9 virus infection to MDCK cells with the IC50 value of 22.18 μg/mL. In addition, F3-2 and 1C6B were utilized for comprising a lateral flow immunochromatographic test strip for specific detection of H7N9 HA. KEY POINTS: • Two mouse monoclonal antibodies, F3-2 and 1C6B, were generated for recognizing the novel binding epitopes in H7N9 HA. • F3-2 can prevent H7N9 HA from trypsin cleavage and inhibit H7N9 virus infection to MDCK cells. • F3-2 and 1C6B were developed as a lateral flow immunochromatographic test for specific detection of H7N9 HA.","Chiang, Yi-Wei; Li, Chia-Jung; Su, Heng-Yi; Hsieh, Kai-Ting; Weng, Chia-Wei; Chen, Hui-Wen; Chang, Shih-Chung",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,100,1

Within tissues, macrophage exhibit extremely heterogeneous population with varying functions orchestrated through regulatory response, which can be further exacerbated in diverse genetic backgrounds. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) offer comprehensive understanding of cellular regulatory behavior by unfolding the transcription factors (TFs) and regulated target genes. RNA-Seq coupled with ATAC-Seq has revolutionized the regulome landscape influenced by gene expression modeling. Here, we employ an integrative multi-omics systems biology-based analysis and generated GRNs derived from the unstimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages of five inbred genetically defined murine strains, which are reported to be linked with most of the population-wide human genetic variants. Our probabilistic modeling of a basal hemostasis pan regulatory repertoire in diverse macrophages discovered 96 TFs targeting 6279 genes representing 468,291 interactions across five inbred murine strains. Subsequently, we identify core and distinctive GRN sub-networks in unstimulated macrophages to describe the system-wide conservation and dissimilarities, respectively across five murine strains. Our study concludes that discrepancies in unstimulated macrophage-specific regulatory networks not only drives the basal functional plasticity within genetic backgrounds, additionally aid in understanding the complexity of racial disparity among the human population during stress.","Mishra, Bharat; Athar, Mohammad; Mukhtar, M.

A pretravel comprehensive consultation is therefore strongly recommended. Whether a child with rheumatic disease is sufficiently fit for travel essentially depends on the disease activity, the age of the child and the intended travel destination. Depending on the level of immunosuppression, the risks for this patient group include (travel-related) infections and the possibility of disease activity flares. Of particular importance is adequate exposure prevention: standard vaccinations should be updated and indications for travel vaccinations evaluated in advance of travelling. In this context, potential contraindications, especially for live vaccines, in the case of specific immunosuppressive treatment should be considered. In the event of travel to malaria endemic areas, the necessity for chemoprophylaxis or stand-by medication must be evaluated but caution is needed regarding potential drug interactions. Detailed education about careful hand, food and contact hygiene is critical. Because photosensitivity may be increased in some rheumatic diseases and/or medications, UV protection is crucial. Barriers (clothes and mosquito nets) and age-appropriate chemical insect repellents should be used to prevent insect-borne diseases. Before start of travel, possibilities for on-site medical help in the event of disease deterioration and/or infection should be evaluated. This should be included in the assessment of the patient’s ability to travel. Travelers with rheumatic disease should carry a first aid kit that includes both a sufficient supply of regular antirheumatic medication and supplemental medication in case of a disease flare. Storage conditions must be taken ínto account for some medications. Ultimately, the success of a journey depends on the planning from the perspective of the child with its specific needs.","Freudenhammer, M.; Hufnagel, M.",Z Rheumatol,100,1

Current monotherapies show limited efficacy due to often rapidly emerging resistance. Combination therapies could provide an alternative solution to address this problem with enhanced therapeutic effect, reduced cytotoxicity, and delayed the appearance of drug resistance. However, it is prohibitively cost and labor-intensive for the experimental approaches to pick out synergistic combinations from the millions of possibilities. Thus, it is highly desired to explore other efficient strategies to assist experimental researches. Inspired by the challenge, we construct the transcriptomics-based and network-based prediction models to quickly screen the potential drug combination for Prostate cancer, and further assess their performance by in vitro assays. The transcriptomics-based method screens nine possible combinations. However, the network-based method gives discrepancies for at least three drug pairs. Further experimental results indicate the dose-dependent effects of the three docetaxel-containing combinations, and confirm the synergistic effects of the other six combinations predicted by the transcriptomics-based model. For the network-based predictions, in vitro tests give opposite results to the two combinations (i.e. mitoxantrone-cyproheptadine and cabazitaxel-cyproheptadine). Namely, the transcriptomics-based method outperforms the network-based one for the specific disease like Prostate cancer, which provide guideline for selection of the computational methods in the drug combination screening. More importantly, six combinations (the three mitoxantrone-containing and the three cabazitaxel-containing combinations) are found to be promising candidates to synergistically conquer Prostate cancer.","Li, Shiqi; Zhang, Fuhui; Xiao, Xiuchan; Guo, Yanzhi; Wen, Zhining; Li, Menglong; Pu, Xuemei",Front Pharmacol,100,1

A total of 118 proteins were identified, and 17 showed significant changes between the two groups. The changes observed in proteins were closely related to an impaired primary immune defense and antimicrobial capacity in the mucosa, and one salivary protein (lactoferrin) was successfully verified. These results may increase the background and knowledge of saliva composition in horses with AAD and further understanding of the physiopathological changes occurring in the organism in this disease. ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in the salivary proteome in horses with acute abdominal disease (AAD) using a tandem mass tags (TMT)-based proteomic approach. The saliva samples from eight horses with AAD were compared with six healthy horses in the proteomic study. Additionally, saliva samples from eight horses with AAD and eight controls were used to validate lactoferrin (LF) in saliva. The TMT analysis quantified 118 proteins. Of these, 17 differed significantly between horses with AAD and the healthy controls, 11 being downregulated and 6 upregulated. Our results showed the downregulation of gamma-enteric smooth muscle actin (ACTA2), latherin isoform X1, and LF. These proteins could be closely related to an impaired primary immune defense and antimicrobial capacity in the mucosa. In addition, there was an upregulation of mucin 19 (MUC19) and the serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 (SPINK5) associated with a protective effect during inflammation. The proteins identified in our study could have the potential to be novel biomarkers for diagnosis or monitoring the physiopathology of the disease, especially LF, which decreased in the saliva of horses with AAD and was successfully measured using a commercially available immunoassay.","Muñoz-Prieto, Alberto; Escribano, Damián; Contreras-Aguilar, María Dolores; Horvatić, Anita; Guillemin, Nicolas; Jacobsen, Stine; Cerón, José Joaquín; Mrljak, Vladimir",Animals (Basel),100,5

Recent studies identified protein components of the complement and coagulation systems as key pathways implicated in psychosis. These specific protein alterations are integral to the inflammatory response and can begin years before the onset of clinical symptoms of psychotic disorder. Critically, they have recently been shown to predict the transition from clinical high risk to first-episode psychosis, enabling stratification of individuals who are most likely to transition to psychotic disorder from those who are not. This reinforces the concept that the psychosis spectrum is likely a central nervous system manifestation of systemic changes and highlights the need to investigate plasma proteins as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and pathophysiological mediators. In this review, we integrate evidence of alterations in proteins belonging to the complement and coagulation protein systems, including the coagulation, anticoagulation, and fibrinolytic pathways and their dysregulation in psychosis, into a consolidated mechanism that could be integral to the progression and manifestation of psychosis. We consolidate the findings of altered blood proteins relevant for progression to psychotic disorders, using data from longitudinal studies of the general population in addition to clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals transitioning to psychotic disorder. These are compared to markers identified from first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia as well as other psychosis spectrum disorders. We propose the novel hypothesis that altered complement and coagulation plasma levels enhance their pathways’ activating capacities, while low levels observed in key regulatory components contribute to excessive activation observed in patients. This hypothesis will require future testing through a range of experimental paradigms, and if upheld, complement and coagulation pathways or specific proteins could be useful diagnostic or prognostic tools and targets for early intervention and preventive strategies.","Heurich, Meike; Föcking, Melanie; Mongan, David; Cagney, Gerard; Cotter, David R.",Mol Psychiatry,100,1

Research shows that taking long-term atorvastatin has the risk of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in most patients. Hugan tablets, a commonly used drug for liver disease, can effectively lower transaminase and protect the liver. However, the underlying mechanism of Hugan tablets alleviating atorvastatin-induced DILI remains unclear. To address this problem, comprehensive chemical profiling and network pharmacology methods were used in the study. First, the strategy of “compound−single herb−TCM prescription” was applied to characterize the ingredients of Hugan tablets. Then, active ingredients and potential targets of Hugan tablets in DILI treatment were screened using network pharmacology, molecular docking, and literature research. In the end, the mechanism of Hugan tablets in treating atorvastatin-induced DILI was elucidated. The results showed that Hugan tablets can effectively alleviate DILI induced by atorvastatin in model rats, and 71 compounds were characterized from Hugan tablets. Based on these compounds, 271 potential targets for the treatment of DILI were predicted, and 10 key targets were chosen by characterizing protein–protein interactions. Then, 30 potential active ingredients were screened through the molecular docking with these 10 key targets, and their biological activity was explained based on literature research. Finally, the major 19 active ingredients of Hugan tablets were discovered. In addition, further enrichment analysis of 271 targets indicated that the PI3K-Akt, TNF, HIF-1, Rap1, and FoxO signaling pathways may be the primary pathways regulated by Hugan tablets in treating DILI. This study proved that Hugan tablets could alleviate atorvastatin-induced DILI through multiple components, targets, and pathways.","Lv, Shujing; Yu, Honghong; Liu, Xinyue; Gao, Xiaoyan",Front Pharmacol,100,1

We investigated the utility of postoperative NT-proBNP as an objective marker of PHF after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). METHODS: Prospective study on 382 patients undergoing isolated CABG for acute coronary syndrome. NT-proBNP was measured preoperatively, the first (POD1) and third postoperative morning (POD3). A blinded Endpoints Committee used prespecified criteria for PHF. Use of circulatory support was scrutinized. RESULTS: After adjusting for confounders PHF was associated with 1.46 times higher NT-proBNP on POD1 (p = 0.002), 1.54 times higher on POD3 (p < 0.0001). In severe PHF, NT-proBNP was 2.18 times higher on POD1 (p = 0.001) and 1.81 times higher on POD3 (p = 0.019). Postoperative change of NT-proBNP was independently associated with PHF (OR 5.12, 95% CI 1.86–14.10, p = 0.002). The use of inotropes and ICU resources increased with incremental quartiles of postoperative NT-proBNP. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative NT-proBNP can serve as an objective marker of the severity of postoperative myocardial dysfunction. Due to overlap in individuals, NT-proBNP is useful mainly for comparisons at cohort level. As such, it provides a tool for study purposes when an unbiased assessment of prevention or treatment of PHF is desirable.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess whether web-based searches on common cold would correlate with and help to predict asthma hospitalizations. METHODS: We analyzed all hospitalizations with a main diagnosis of asthma occurring in 5 different countries (Portugal, Spain, Finland, Norway, and Brazil) for a period of approximately 5 years (January 1, 2012-December 17, 2016). Data on web-based searches on common cold were retrieved from Google Trends (GT) using the pseudo-influenza syndrome topic and local language search terms for common cold for the same countries and periods. We applied time series analysis methods to estimate the correlation between GT and hospitalization data. In addition, we built autoregressive models to forecast the weekly number of asthma hospitalizations for a period of 1 year (June 2015-June 2016) based on admissions and GT data from the 3 previous years. RESULTS: In time series analyses, GT data on common cold displayed strong correlations with asthma hospitalizations occurring in Portugal (correlation coefficients ranging from 0.63 to 0.73), Spain (ρ=0.82-0.84), and Brazil (ρ=0.77-0.83) and moderate correlations with those occurring in Norway (ρ=0.32-0.35) and Finland (ρ=0.44-0.47). Similar patterns were observed in the correlation between forecasted and observed asthma hospitalizations from June 2015 to June 2016, with the number of forecasted hospitalizations differing on average between 12% (Spain) and 33% (Norway) from observed hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Common cold–related web-based searches display moderate-to-strong correlations with asthma hospitalizations and may be useful in forecasting them.","Sousa-Pinto, Bernardo; Halonen, Jaana I; Antó, Aram; Jormanainen, Vesa; Czarlewski, Wienczyslawa; Bedbrook, Anna; Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G; Freitas, Alberto; Haahtela, Tari; Antó, Josep M; Fonseca, João Almeida; Bousquet, Jean",J Med Internet Res,100,1

Due to major improvements in treatment procedures in the past 50 years, the survivability of this disease has risen dramatically to about 90 percent today. L-asparaginase (ASNase) has been used to treat ALL. The glutaminase (GLNase) activity of this enzyme causes some side effects and is unnecessary for anticancer activity. This study investigated mutagenesis in Escherichia coli ASNase II to find a mutant with lower GLNase activity via molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Residues with low binding energy to asparagine (Asn) and high binding energy to glutamine (Gln) were chosen for mutagenesis. A mutant with low free binding energy to Gln was then selected for molecular docking and MD studies. The results showed that V27F is a good candidate for reducing GLNase activity and that it has little effect on enzyme ASNase activity. A simulation analysis showed that the V27F mutant was more stable than the WT ASNase and that mutagenesis was quite successful.","Ardalan, Noeman; Akhavan Sepahi, Abbas; Khavari-Nejad, Ramazan Ali",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,100,22

Any failure at any point could have a severe negative impact on patient outcomes. PURPOSE: This project aimed to assess and improve the nursing blood sampling process in a specialized cancer center using failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA). METHODS: An observational analytical design of the nursing blood sampling process using FMEA was conducted in King Hussein Cancer Center in Amman, Jordan. Seven steps were conducted, including a review of the blood sampling process, brainstorming potential failures, listing potential effects of each failure mode, assigning a severity rating for each potential effect, assigning a frequency/occurrence rating for each failure mode, assigning a detection rating scale for each failure mode, and calculating the Risk Priority Number (RPN) for each effect. RESULTS: Eight (out of 28) main critical failure modes with more than 200 RPN were identified in the blood sampling process. Accordingly, five themes were developed to guide the corrective actions. These themes included: process and responsibility modifications, resource and information technology utilization, patients and family engagement, safety culture, and education and training after implementation of the corrective actions. This resulted in a 58 % reduction in the RPN of major failure modes. CONCLUSION: Many factors lead to blood sampling errors. A critical focus should be conducted on the preparation phase due to the possible errors that may occur. Proper identification of patients and blood sample tests are the keys to a significant decrease in blood sampling errors.","Haroun, Anas; AL- Ruzzieh, Majeda A; Hussien, Najah; Masa’ad, Abdelrahman; Hassoneh, Rateb; Abu Alrub, Ghada; Ayaad, Omar",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,100,22

However, little is known in terms of its effectiveness as an assessment tool and the extent to which peer assessment can be relied upon in the absence of faculty support. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess medical students’ perception toward peer learning, which is based on self-regulated learning as a tool of assessment, and to compare peer evaluation with faculty evaluation of clinical skill performance. METHODS: A cohort of 36 third-year medical students were exposed to peer learning (same-level) in clinical skills education for 3 months. A convergent mixed methods approach was adapted to collect data from 3 sources, namely, students’ perception of peer learning, performance scores, and reflective observational analysis. A 5-point Likert-type scale was used to assess students’ (n=28) perception on the value of peer learning. The students were asked to assess their peers by using a preset checklist on clinical skill performance, and scores were compared to faculty assessment scores. Reflective observational data were collected from observing video recordings of some of the peer learning sessions. The findings from all 3 sources were integrated using joint display analysis. RESULTS: Out of 28 students, 25 students completed the survey and 20 students perceived peer learning as valuable in clinical skills education. The mean score of peer assessment was higher than that of faculty assessment. There was a significant difference in student performance between supervised teaching and peer learning groups (P=.003). Most students focused on the mastery of skill with little attention to the technique’s quality. Further, students were unable to appreciate the relevance of the potential clinical findings of physical examination. CONCLUSIONS: Peer learning in clinical skills education, based on self-regulated learning, empowers students to develop a more responsible approach toward their education. However, peer assessment is insufficient to evaluate clinical skill performance in the absence of faculty support. Therefore, we recommend that peer learning activities be preceded by supervised faculty-taught sessions.","Alzaabi, Shaikha; Nasaif, Mohammed; Khamis, Amar Hassan; Otaki, Farah; Zary, Nabil; Mascarenhas, Sharon",JMIR Med Educ,100,11

The most unique structural motif of polymer-grafted nanoparticles (PGNs) is the high-density region in the corona where polymer chains are stretched under significant confinement, but orientation of these chains has never been measured because conventional nanoscale-resolved measurements lack sensitivity to polymer orientation in amorphous regions. Here, we directly measure local chain orientation in polystyrene grafted gold nanoparticles using polarized resonant soft X-ray scattering (P-RSoXS). Using a computational scattering pattern simulation approach, we measure the thickness of the anisotropic region of the corona and extent of chain orientation within it.

Sixteen eligible studies published during 2002–2020 were included. Using meta-analysis of proportions, the pooled prevalence of TB cases with resistance to any anti-TB drugs was 47.0% (95% CI: 35.5–58.6%). The overall prevalence of mono, multi, poly and extensive drug resistance were estimated to be 16.2% (95% CI: 9.0–23.4%), 22.8% (95% CI: 16.0–29.7%), 6.8% (95% CI: 0.5–13.0%) and 0.7% (95% CI: 0–2.1%), respectively. Considering any first-line anti-TB drugs, the resistance prevalence was highest for isoniazid (32.3%) and streptomycin (31.7%), followed by rifampicin (29.2%). In contrast, resistance against second-line drugs was reported for only two antibiotics, namely, ofloxacin (2.1%) and kanamycin (0.7%). Of note, the resistance profile of the previously treated patients was found to be remarkably high compared with the newly diagnosed TB patients. The relatively high prevalence estimation of anti-TB drug resistance warrants strengthening TB control and treatment strategies in Sudan.","Hajissa, Khalid; Marzan, Mahfuza; Idriss, Mubarak Ibrahim; Islam, Md Asiful",Antibiotics (Basel),100,1

Herein, a potential solution involving a rapid direct-injection liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method for the quantitative determination of 102 CECs (151 qualitatively) in river water is presented and applied across six rivers in Germany and Switzerland at high spatial resolution. The method required an injection volume of only 10 µL of filtered sample, with a runtime of 5.5 min including re-equilibration with >10 datapoints per peak per transition (mostly 2 per compound), and 36 stable isotope-labelled standards. Performance was excellent from the low ng/L to µg/L concentration level, with 260 injections possible in any 24 h period. The method was applied in three separate campaigns focusing on the ERA of rivers impacted by wastewater effluent discharges (1 urban area in the Basel city region with 4 rivers, as well as 1 semi-rural and 1 rural area, each focusing on 1 river). Between 25 and 40 compounds were quantified directly in each campaign, and in all cases small tributary rivers showed higher CEC concentrations (e.g., up to ~4000 ng/L in total in the R. Schwarzach, Bavaria, Germany). The source of selected CECs could also be identified and differentiated from other sources at pre- and post- wastewater treatment plant effluent discharge points, as well as the effect of dilution downstream, which occurred over very short distances in all cases. Lastly, ERA for 41 CECs was performed at specific impacted sites, with risk quotients (RQs) at 1 or more sites estimated as high risk (RQ > 10) for 1 pharmaceutical (diclofenac), medium risk (RQ of 1–10) for 3 CECs (carbamazepine, venlafaxine, and sulfamethoxazole), and low risk (RQ = 0.1–1.0) for 7 CECs (i.e., RQ > 0.1 for 11 CECs in total).

METHODS: Position errors combining 0-, 2-, and 4-mm errors in the left-right (LR), anterior-posterior (AP), and superior-inferior (SI) directions in the delivery of 40 GO patient radiotherapy plans to a human head phantom were simulated and EPID transmission fluence maps were acquired. Dose difference (DD) and structural similarity (SSIM) maps were calculated to quantify changes in the fluence maps. Three types of machine learning (ML) models that utilize radiomics features of the DD maps (ML 1 models), features of the SSIM maps (ML 2 models), and features of both DD and SSIM maps (ML 3 models) as inputs were used to perform three types of position error classification, namely a binary classification of the isocenter error (type 1), three binary classifications of LR, SI, and AP direction errors (type 2), and an eight-element classification of the combined LR, SI, and AP direction errors (type 3). Convolutional neural network (CNN) was also used to classify position errors using the DD and SSIM maps as input.

Low-cost vaccines that can be combined to protect poultry against multiple infections are a current global imperative. Glycoconjugate vaccines, which consist of an immunogenic protein covalently coupled to glycan antigens of the targeted pathogen, have a proven track record in human vaccinology, but have yet to be used for livestock due to prohibitively high manufacturing costs. To overcome this, we use Protein Glycan Coupling Technology (PGCT), which enables the production of glycoconjugates in bacterial cells at considerably reduced costs, to generate a candidate glycan-based live vaccine intended to simultaneously protect against Campylobacter jejuni, avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) and Clostridium perfringens. Campylobacter is the most common cause of food poisoning, whereas colibacillosis and necrotic enteritis are widespread and devastating infectious diseases in poultry. RESULTS: We demonstrate the functional transfer of C. jejuni protein glycosylation (pgl) locus into the genome of APEC χ7122 serotype O78:H9. The integration caused mild attenuation of the χ7122 strain following oral inoculation of chickens without impairing its ability to colonise the respiratory tract. We exploit the χ7122 pgl integrant as bacterial vectors delivering a glycoprotein decorated with the C. jejuni heptasaccharide glycan antigen. To this end we engineered χ7122 pgl to express glycosylated NetB toxoid from C. perfringens and tested its ability to reduce caecal colonisation of chickens by C. jejuni and protect against intra-air sac challenge with the homologous APEC strain. CONCLUSIONS: We generated a candidate glycan-based multivalent live vaccine with the potential to induce protection against key avian and zoonotic pathogens (C. jejuni, APEC, C. perfringens). The live vaccine failed to significantly reduce Campylobacter colonisation under the conditions tested but was protective against homologous APEC challenge. Nevertheless, we present a strategy towards the production of low-cost “live-attenuated multivalent vaccine factories” with the ability to express glycoconjugates in poultry.

Results from anti-HIV screening against HIV-2 strain ROD indicated that one compound was more potent (IC (50) ≥ 1 μg/cm(3)) than the standard drug nevirapine (IC (50) ≥ 4 μg/cm(3)) and another was equipotent (IC (50) ≥ 4 μg/cm(3)). The most effective anticancer agent against both HCT116 and MCF7 cancer cell lines had IC (50) = 19 and 18 μg/cm(3), respectively. QSAR analysis indicated the importance of Wiener index (W) and energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in describing the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds.

This increase is partly explained by changes in food processing and consumption patterns that lead to the worldwide availability of high-risk food. As a result, vast outbreaks may occur due to contamination of food by a single foodhandler or at a single source. Although there are numerous fecal–orally transmitted viruses, most reports of foodborne transmission describe infections with Norwalk-like caliciviruses (NLV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV), suggesting that these viruses are associated with the greatest risk of foodborne transmission. NLV and HAV can be transmitted from person to person, or indirectly via food, water, or fomites contaminated with virus-containing feces or vomit. People can be infected without showing symptoms. The high frequency of secondary cases of NLV illness and – to a lesser extent – of hepatitis A following a foodborne outbreak results in amplification of the problem. The burden of illness is highest in the elderly, and therefore is likely to increase due to the aging population. For HAV, the burden of illness may increase following hygienic control measures, due to a decreasing population of naturally immune individuals and a concurrent increase in the population at risk. Recent advances in the research of NLV and HAV have led to the development of molecular methods which can be used for molecular tracing of virus strains. These methods can be and have been used for the detection of common source outbreaks. While traditionally certain foods have been implicated in virus outbreaks, it is clear that almost any food item can be involved, provided it has been handled by an infected person. There are no established methods for detection of viruses in foods other than shellfish. Little information is available on disinfection and preventive measures specifically for these viruses. Studies addressing this issue are hampered by the lack of culture systems. As currently available routine monitoring systems exclusively focus on bacterial pathogens, efforts should be made to combine epidemiological and virological information for a combined laboratory-based rapid detection system for foodborne viruses. With better surveillance, including typing information, outbreaks of foodborne infections could be reported faster to prevent further spread.","Koopmans, Marion; von Bonsdorff, Carl-Henrik; Vinjé, Jan; de Medici, Dario; Monroe, Steve",FEMS Microbiol Rev,100,1

Since then, there have been three major outbreaks in the cold season of 2003–2004 and in the rainy and cold seasons of 2004–2005 and 2005–2006. More than 62 million birds died or were culled. The burden shifted from large industrial farming in the first outbreak to small farms, backyard chickens, and free-grazing ducks. Up to November 2005, there were 20 confirmed cases of human H5N1 infection. Thirteen of these died. Most of the confirmed cases were solitary ones except for three persons in a single family, and epidemiological evidence indicated that person-to-person transmission may have been involved in this cluster. However, sequence analysis of the virus in the cluster did not suggest any changes that might enhance the viral ability to get transmitted among humans. H5N1 viruses in Thailand and Vietnam belong to a single lineage genetically and are antigenically distinguishable from the viruses of the same genotype Z from southern China and Indonesia. Despite the seemingly subsiding epidemic in Thailand, the problem is far from resolved. H5N1 viruses are still sporadically isolated from domestic poultry as well as from wildlife. More important, isolates were also found in asymptomatic animals. Natural selection may have adapted the virus to a less aggressive form. This would make the virus more elusive and difficult to control. A threat of a pandemic strain emerging from the H5N1 virus is still imminent. A national strategic plan for avian influenza control and influenza pandemic preparedness has been implemented. The plan aims at effective control of avian influenza spread in animals as well as in humans for a three-year period and at efficient pandemic preparedness within one year. Nevertheless, more regional and international collaboration is needed. With proper collective preparedness, there is a hope that the threatening influenza pandemic can be prevented by confining and eliminating a potential pandemic strain at its origin. In December 2003, poultry farms in the eastern, central, and northern regions of Thailand experienced large-scale die-offs. The outbreak started from the eastern region of the country. The disease caused rapid death, with a very high attack rate. At that time, H5N1 outbreaks had been reported in South Korea, Vietnam, and Japan (OIE, 2005). A few humans with pneumonia were suspected to originate from contact with sick or dead poultry. Final diagnosis in these patients was not done as clinical samples were not available at the time when proper diagnostic testing became available. On 23 January 2004, the first case of human H5N1 infection in Thailand was reported. It was a boy from Kanchanaburi, a province about 100 km west of Bangkok. He was admitted to Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok and was diagnosed to have severe progressive pneumonia. The patient was initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, and respiratory samples were tested for influenza virus. The laboratory result showed that the patient harbored influenza virus, and sequencing of the viral RNA indicated that the virus belonged to the H5 subtype (Chokephaibulkit et al., 2005; Puthavathana et al., 2005). When this result was reported to the Ministry of Public Health, the government announced that there was a highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) outbreak in Thailand. The Department of Livestock Development (DLD) confirmed the presence of H5N1 viruses in poultry on the same day. Subsequent analysis of the virus from patients and animals confirmed that it was H5N1 AI virus of genotype Z and was closely related to the virus from Vietnam (Viseshakul et al., 2004; Puthavathana et al., 2005).","Auewarakul, Prasert",Emerging Infections in Asia,100,1

To analyze how risk is perceived and expressed through these tools is relevant to risk theory. This chapter clarifies the different concepts of risk, contrasting especially the mathematically expressed ones with culturally informed notions, which address a broader view on risk. I will suggest that a fruitful way to contextualize computational tools, such mathematical models in risk assessment is “analytics of risk,” which ties together the technological, epistemological, and political dimensions of the process of governance of risk. I will clarify the development of mathematical modeling techniques through their use in infectious disease epidemiology. Epidemiological modeling functions as a form of “risk calculation,” which provides predictions of the infectious outbreak in question. These calculations help direct and design preventive actions toward the health outcomes of populations. This chapter analyzes two cases in which modeling methods are used for explanation-based and scenario-building predictions in order to anticipate the risks of infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b bacteria and A(H1N1) pandemic influenza virus. I will address an interesting tension that arises when model-based estimates exemplify the population-level reasoning of public health risks but has restricted capacity to address risks on individual level. Analyzing this tension will lead to a fuller account to understand the benefits and limitations of computational tools in the governance of public health risks.","Mansnerus, Erika",Handbook of Risk Theory,100,19

The RAS counter-regulatory axis composed by the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] and Mas receptor mediates pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic, and pro-fibrotic processes, frequently opposing the classical RAS arm (ACE-Ang II-AT(1) receptor) actions. Therefore, the balance between both RAS axes most likely affects the clinical and histopathological expression of liver diseases. It is worth noticing that liver diseases are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Without proper treatment, all types of chronic hepatitis will progress to end-stage liver diseases, including cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma, which ultimately lead to death. In this context, to better comprehend the role of RAS components in liver failure might pave the way for the search of potential predictive biomarkers as well as the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Valuable data have been generated from preclinical and clinical studies. Herein, we summarize the current evidence, mainly focusing in the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas receptor arm, regarding the role of RAS in liver diseases.

Direct contacts represent the most obvious opportunities for a signal to be transmitted. However, because signals that persist after being deposited into the environment may later be acquired by other group members, indirect environmentally-mediated transmission is also possible. To date, studies of signal transmission within groups have focused on direct physical interactions and ignored the role of indirect pathways. Here, we use an agent-based model to study how the movement of individuals and characteristics of the signal being transmitted modulate transmission. By analysing the dynamic interaction networks generated from these simulations, we show that the addition of indirect pathways speeds up signal transmission, while the addition of physically-realistic collisions between individuals in densely packed environments hampers it. Furthermore, the inclusion of spatial biases that induce the formation of individual territories, reveals the existence of a trade-off such that optimal signal transmission at the group level is only achieved when territories are of intermediate sizes. Our findings provide insight into the selective pressures guiding the evolution of behavioural traits in natural groups, and offer a means by which multi-agent systems can be engineered to achieve desired transmission capabilities.","Gorochowski, Thomas E.; Richardson, Thomas O.",Temporal Network Epidemiology,100,1

Given a sequence of text passages as query, the goal is to retrieve a sequence of images that best describes and aligns with the query. This new task extends the traditional cross-modal retrieval, where each image-text pair is treated independently ignoring broader context. We propose a novel variational recurrent seq2seq (VRSS) retrieval model for this seq2seq task. Unlike most cross-modal methods, we generate an image vector corresponding to the latent topic obtained from combining the text semantics and context. This synthetic image embedding point associated with every text embedding point can then be employed for either image generation or image retrieval as desired. We evaluate the model for the application of stepwise illustration of recipes, where a sequence of relevant images are retrieved to best match the steps described in the text. To this end, we build and release a new Stepwise Recipe dataset for research purposes, containing 10K recipes (sequences of image-text pairs) having a total of 67K image-text pairs. To our knowledge, it is the first publicly available dataset to offer rich semantic descriptions in a focused category such as food or recipes. Our model is shown to outperform several competitive and relevant baselines in the experiments. We also provide qualitative analysis of how semantically meaningful the results produced by our model are through human evaluation and comparison with relevant existing methods.","Batra, Vishwash; Haldar, Aparajita; He, Yulan; Ferhatosmanoglu, Hakan; Vogiatzis, George; Guha, Tanaya",Advances in Information Retrieval,100,1

It comprises the process of identifying, between different data sources, entity descriptions that refer to the same real-world entity. In this work, we focus on toponym interlinking, that is we handle spatio-textual entities that are exclusively represented by their name; additional properties, such as categories, coordinates, etc. are considered as either absent or of too low quality to be exploited in this setting. Toponyms are inherently heterogeneous entities; quite often several alternative names exist for the same toponym, with varying degrees of similarity between these names. State of the art approaches adopt mostly generic, domain-agnostic similarity functions and use them as is, or incorporate them as training features within classifiers for performing toponym interlinking. We claim that capturing the specificities of toponyms and exploiting them into elaborate meta-similarity functions and derived training features can significantly increase the effectiveness of interlinking methods. To this end, we propose the LGM-Sim meta-similarity function and a series of novel, similarity-based and statistical training features that can be utilized in similarity-based and classification-based interlinking settings respectively. We demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve large increases in accuracy, in both settings, compared to several methods from the literature in the widely used Geonames toponym dataset.","Giannopoulos, Giorgos; Kaffes, Vassilis; Kostoulas, Georgios",Advances in Information Retrieval,100,1

By 2020, COPD will be the third leading cause of death and the fifth leading cause of disability. It is – along with chronic congestive heart failure – one of the most common causes of unscheduled hospital readmissions, and as such it represents a significant economic burden for the health-care system. Exacerbations of COPD are important events in the natural history of this prevalent condition. DISCUSSION: This review provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art look at prevention and management of COPD exacerbations. Treatment of these episodes has to be tailored to the severity of the clinical presentation. We now have a wide range of therapeutic available options, based on the results of clinical trials. Management of the acute event should include the necessary measures (mainly the administration of inhaled short-acting bronchodilators, inhaled or oral corticosteroids, and antibiotics), with or without oxygen and ventilator support. CONCLUSIONS: To improve the management of COPD exacerbations, the focus of care must be shifted from the episodic acute complications to their systematic prevention. The management of COPD, which is often associated with multiple co-morbidities, is complex and requires a tailored, multifaceted and multidisciplinary approach. Integrated care for COPD also requires that patients be informed about their condition, that they participate actively in their care, and that they have easy access to the necessary health-care services.","Belmonte, Gelorma; Muratori, Marilena; Leandri, Paolo; Pasquale, Angelo; Reta, Massimo; Nardi, Roberto",,100,1

Results showed that the two allergens of pistachio significantly reduce the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria as well as two fungi. Moreover, they exerted significant in vitro cytotoxic activities against Human ovarian carcinoma (A2780), human colon carcinoma (HTC), human glioblastoma (U-87-MG), human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), and human prostate cell lines (PC3 and DU-145). Our findings revealed that the highest antimicrobial effect of the allergens was found against M. loteus (MIC = 10 µg/mL). The lowest IC(50) value was found for Pis v 2.0101 allergen (11S globulin) against CV-B4 (30.20 ± 1.01 µg/mL). Furthermore, in vitro cytotoxicity assay showed IC(50) values ranging from 21.09 ± 0.55 to 34.52 ± 0.90 and 26.34 ± 0.88 to 38.63 ± 0.80 µg/mL for Pis v 2.0101 (11S globulin) and Pis v 1 (2S albumin), respectively.

It was surmised that this might be because of increased sensitivity to one of the common families of respiratory viruses. Two lines of study were therefore followed. In the first, men were examined at intervals throughout their stay in Antarctica at Stonington Island, and their titers of specific antibody against a wide range of respiratory viruses were measured throughout the isolation period. The second line of study consisted of three clinical trials in which a dose of a known respiratory virus was given to a number of subjects. The clinical and serological responses and the spread of the organism within the community were observed. The results of these investigations were compared with those of similar trials in England carried out at the Common Cold Unit at Salisbury. The results of the study suggested that it is possible to introduce a virus into a closed community, and under primitive conditions, to record its spread and the symptoms it causes.","Holmes, M.J.",Polar Human Biology,100,1

Emtricitabine represents one of the most potent anti-HIV agents identified to date, producing two log(10) drop in viral load as monotherapy at a 200 mg qd dose as the affected individual became susceptible to opportunistic infections and specific immune deficiency resulting from the depletion of CD4(+) lymphocytes. The clinical profile of emtricitabine discussed in this chapter demonstrated (1) a plasma half-life of 8-10 hours with linear kinetics, (2) an intracellular emtricitabine 5’-triphosphate half-life greater than 39 hours that supports daily dosing, (3) no significant drug–drug interactions that limits the use of emtricitabine in combination therapy, (4) comparable safety and efficacy to lamivudine, and (5) low incidence of Ml84V mutations. This important observation suggests that emtricitabine can increase the durability of oxathiolane nucleoside analog-containing drug regimens. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) constitutes a major worldwide health threat, as the clinical development program is just entering the pivotal phase. Emtricitabine can be an extremely important drug for the treatment of patients coinfected with HIV and HBV.","Painter, George R.; Rimsky, Laurence T.; Furman, Phillip A.; Liotta, Dennis C.; Schinazi, Raymond F.; Quinn, Joseph B.",Frontiers in Viral Hepatitis,100,1

Fresh produce has been identified as an important vehicle for their transmission. In order to supply a basis to identify possible prevention and control strategies, this review intends to demonstrate the fate of foodborne viruses in the farm to fork chain of fresh produce, which include the introduction routes (contamination sources), the viral survival abilities at different stages, and the reactions of foodborne viruses towards the treatments used in food processing of fresh produce. In general, the preharvest contamination comes mainly from soli fertilizer or irrigation water, while the harvest and postharvest contaminations come mainly from food handlers, which can be both symptomatic and asymptomatic. Foodborne viruses show high stabilities in all the stages of fresh produce production and processing. Low‐temperature storage and other currently used preservation techniques, as well as washing by water have shown limited added value for reducing the virus load on fresh produce. Chemical sanitizers, although with limitations, are strongly recommended to be applied in the wash water in order to minimize cross‐contamination. Alternatively, radiation strategies have shown promising inactivating effects on foodborne viruses. For high‐pressure processing and thermal treatment, efforts have to be made on setting up treatment parameters to induce sufficient viral inactivation within a food matrix and to protect the sensory and nutritional qualities of fresh produce to the largest extent.","Li, Dan; De Keuckelaere, Ann; Uyttendaele, Mieke",Compr Rev Food Sci Food Saf,100,1

We examine the stock price behavior of Chinese listed firms around two visible political events—meetings of the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and promotions of high‐level provincial politicians—that are expected to asymmetrically increase the costs of releasing bad news. The costs create an incentive for local politicians and their affiliated firms to temporarily restrict the flow of negative information about the companies. The result will be fewer stock price crashes for the affiliated firms during these event windows, followed by an increase in crashes after the event. Consistent with these predictions, we find that the affiliated firms experience a reduction (an increase) in negative stock return skewness before (after) the event. These effects are strongest in the three‐month period directly preceding the event, among firms that are more politically connected, and when the province is dominated by faction politics and cronyism. Additional tests document a significant reduction in published newspaper articles about affected firms in advance of these political events, suggestive of a link between our observed stock price behavior and temporary shifts in the listed firms’ information environment.","PIOTROSKI, JOSEPH D.; WONG, T.

Eight persons working in normobar atmosphere outside the pressurized chamber served as control donors. The spontaneous cytotoxicity of the PBMCs was estimated in a 4 h 51Cr‐release assay using k562 as NK‐sensitive target cells. The PBMCs were characterized, using 4‐colour flow cytometry, with special emphasis on the NK‐cell subsets. The data were statistically analysed using a multivariate regression model (Stata 8.2). P values <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The estimated cytotoxicity increased significantly in both the group of divers and control donors during the dive (pdivers < 0.01 and pcontrols < 0.01). Although the cytotoxicity increased relatively more (P < 0.01) in the group of divers compared to the group of control donors between day 1 and 2. Discussion: The increased cytotoxicity of PBMC estimated in the group of divers indicate that parts of the cellular immune system are affected during the extreme physiological conditions induced during the initial phase of the presented experimental hyperbaric setup. The increase in cytotoxicity observed in the group of control donors could hypothetically reflect the stress level in persons working outside the pressurized chamber during the dive.","Krog, J.; Jepsen, C.

Antibody, T cells, natural killer cells, complement, phagocytes, and interferon are involved in the response to nearly all infections and, without any doubt, are together responsible for recovery. There is good evidence that T-cell-mediated immunity is of supreme importance in recovery from a variety of microbial infections. These are the infections in which the microorganism replicates intracellularly. Tissue responses in the host bear the hallmarks of T-cell involvement, the infiltrating cells consisting primarily of lymphocytes and macrophages. Inflammation, whether induced by immunological reactions, tissue damage or microbial products, plays a vital role in recovery from infection. Inflammation is necessary for the proper functioning of the immune defenses because it focuses all circulating antimicrobial factors onto the site of infection. Complement can carry out antimicrobial activities. However, there is little direct evidence that the antimicrobial activities of complement are in fact important in the body. Interferons also act on uninfected cells, binding to a cell surface receptor and activating a number of genes involved in immunity to viruses. Multimechanistic recovery is illustrated in the chapter and other issues, such as the role of temperature, tissue repair, and resistance to re-infection are discussed.","Mims, Cedric A.; Nash, Anthony; Stephen, John",Mims' Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease,100,1

Studies of the pharmacologic management of ARDS, such as trials of anti-inflammatory agents, anticoagulants, surfactant, vasodilators, and β(2) agonists, have shown conflicting results [4].

The COVID-19 pandemic has sharpened the profound insecurity of large segments of the UK population, an insecurity itself the product of a decade of ‘austerity’ policies. Increased unemployment, reduced hours, and enforced self-isolation for multiple vulnerable groups is likely to lead to an increase in UK food insecurity, exacerbating diet-related health inequalities. The social and economic crisis associated with the pandemic has exposed the fragility of the system of food charity which, at present, is a key response to growing poverty. A vulnerable food system, with just-in-time supply chains, has been challenged by stockpiling. Resultant food supply issues at food banks, alongside rapidly increasing demand and reduced volunteer numbers, has undermined many food charities, especially independent food banks. In the light of this analysis, we make a series of recommendations. We call for an immediate end to the five week wait for Universal Credit and cash grants for low income households. We ask central and local government to recognise that many food aid providers are already at capacity and unable to adopt additional responsibilities. The government’s - significant - response to the economic crisis associated with COVID-19 has underscored a key principle: it is the government’s responsibility to protect population health, to guarantee household incomes, and to safeguard the economy. Millions of households were in poverty before the pandemic, and millions more will be so unless the government continues to protect household incomes through policy change.","Power, Madeleine; Doherty, Bob; Pybus, Katie; Pickett, Kate",,100,1

METHODS: Retrospective, multicenter, cohort study of patients with CRE infections treated with ceftazidime–avibactam between 2015 and 2019. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Predictive performance was determined by assessing discrimination, calibration and precision. RESULTS: In total, 109 patients were included. Thirty-day mortality occurred in 18 (16.5%) patients. There were no significant differences in discrimination of the three scores [area under the curve (AUC) ICS 0.7039, 95% CI 0.5848–0.8230, PBS 0.6893, 95% CI 0.5709–0.8076, and qPitt 0.6847, 95% CI 0.5671–0.8023; P > 0.05 all pairwise comparisons]. All scores showed adequate calibration and precision. When dichotomized at the optimal cut-points of 11, 3, and 2 for the ICS, PBS, and qPitt, respectively, all scores had NPV > 90% at the expense of low PPV. Patients in the high-risk groups had a relative risk for mortality of 3.184 (95% CI 1.35–8.930), 3.068 (95% CI 1.094–8.606), and 2.850 (95% CI 1.016–7.994) for the dichotomized ICS, PBS, and qPitt, scores respectively. Treatment-related variables (early active antibiotic therapy, combination antibiotics and renal ceftazidime–avibactam dose adjustment) were not associated with mortality after controlling for the risk scores. CONCLUSIONS: In patients treated with ceftazidime–avibactam for CRE infections, mortality risk scores demonstrated variable performance.

In addition, a visual readout by lateral flow strips (LFS) can be used in conjunction with LAMP, making the assay accessible at the point-of-care. However, the amplicons resulting from a LAMP reaction varied in length and shape, making them undiscernible on a double-stranded DNA intercalating dye stained gel. Standard characterization techniques also do not identify which amplicons specifically bind to the LFS, which generate the visual readout. We aimed to standardize our characterization of LAMP products during assay development by using fluorescein amidite (FAM) and biotin-tagged loop forward and backward primers during assay development. A pvuII restriction enzyme digest is applied to the LAMP products. FAM-tagged bands are directly correlated with the LFS visual readout.

Instead, artists tend to use strategies to magnify some special parts of the items and cut others down. Second, the elements in artistic drawings may not be located precisely. What’s more, the lines may not relate to the features of the items strictly. To address above challenges, we propose ArtPDGAN, a novel GAN based framework that combines an image-to-image network to generate key map. And then, we use the key map as an important part of input to generate artistic pencil drawings. The key map can show the key parts of the items to guide the generator. We use a paired and unaligned artistic drawing dataset containing high-resolution photos of items and corresponding professional artistic pencil drawings to train ArtPDGAN.

[Formula: see text] is a two-party protocol between an updater and a reader. The updater sets the database and updates it at any time throughout the protocol execution. The reader computes zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs of knowledge of database entries. These proofs prove that a value is stored at a certain position in the database, without revealing the position or the value. (Non-)updatable databases are implicitly used as building block in priced oblivious transfer, privacy-preserving billing and other privacy-preserving protocols. Typically, in those protocols the updater signs each database entry, and the reader proves knowledge of a signature on a database entry. Updating the database requires a revocation mechanism to revoke signatures on outdated database entries. Our construction [Formula: see text] uses a non-hiding vector commitment (NHVC) scheme. The updater maps the database to a vector and commits to the database. This commitment can be updated efficiently at any time without needing a revocation mechanism. ZK proofs for reading a database entry have communication and amortized computation cost independent of the database size. Therefore, [Formula: see text] is suitable for large databases. We implement [Formula: see text] and our timings show that it is practical. In existing privacy-preserving protocols, a ZK proof of a database entry is intertwined with other tasks, e.g., proving further statements about the value read from the database or the position where it is stored.

Given the cost implications of a nationwide programme, local economic evaluation data are needed to inform policy on the design and benefits of influenza vaccination. We set out to estimate the cost-effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination in Kenya. METHODS: We fitted an age-stratified dynamic transmission model to active surveillance data from patients with influenza from 2010 to 2018. Using a societal perspective, we developed a decision tree cost-effectiveness model and estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted for three vaccine target groups: children 6–23 months (strategy I), 2–5 years (strategy II) and 6–14 years (strategy III) with either the Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine (Strategy A) or Northern Hemisphere vaccine (Strategy B) or both (Strategy C: twice yearly vaccination campaigns, or Strategy D: year-round vaccination campaigns). We assessed cost-effectiveness by calculating incremental net monetary benefits (INMB) using a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 1–51% of the annual gross domestic product per capita ($17–$872). RESULTS: The mean number of infections across all ages was 2–15 million per year. When vaccination was well timed to influenza activity, the annual mean ICER per DALY averted for vaccinating children 6–23 months ranged between $749 and $1385 for strategy IA, $442 and $1877 for strategy IB, $678 and $4106 for strategy IC and $1147 and $7933 for strategy ID. For children 2–5 years, it ranged between $945 and $1573 for strategy IIA, $563 and $1869 for strategy IIB, $662 and $4085 for strategy IIC, and $1169 and $7897 for strategy IID. For children 6–14 years, it ranged between $923 and $3116 for strategy IIIA, $1005 and $2223 for strategy IIIB, $883 and $4727 for strategy IIIC and $1467 and $6813 for strategy IIID. Overall, no vaccination strategy was cost-effective at the minimum ($17) and median ($445) WTP thresholds. Vaccinating children 6–23 months once a year had the highest mean INMB value at $872 (WTP threshold upper limit); however, this strategy had very low probability of the highest net benefit. CONCLUSION: Vaccinating children 6–23 months once a year was the most favourable vaccination option; however, the strategy is unlikely to be cost-effective given the current WTP thresholds.","Dawa, Jeanette; Emukule, Gideon O.; Barasa, Edwine; Widdowson, Marc Alain; Anzala, Omu; van Leeuwen, Edwin; Baguelin, Marc; Chaves, Sandra S.; Eggo, Rosalind M.",BMC Med,100,1

In order to safely allow an independent development of components, it is necessary to ensure a safe decomposition, i.e. the specification of local timing requirements that prevent later integration errors due to the dependencies. We propose a high-level formalism to model local timing requirements and dependencies. We consider the problem of checking the consistency (existence of an execution satisfying the requirements) and compatibility (absence of an execution that reaches an integration error) of the local requirements, and the problem of synthesizing a region of timing constraints that represents all possible correct refinements of the original specification. We show how the problems can be naturally translated into a model checking and synthesis problem for timed automata with shared variables. Exploiting the linear structure of the requirements, we propose an encoding of the problem into SMT. We evaluate the SMT-based approach using MathSAT and show how it scales better than the automata-based approach using Uppaal and nuXmv.","Cimatti, Alessandro; Geatti, Luca; Griggio, Alberto; Kimberly, Greg; Tonetta, Stefano",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,100,1

However, such measures may increase the risk of loneliness. The current study aimed to investigate (1) whether social distancing measures, particularly limiting close social interactions, are associated with loneliness among older adults, and (2) whether the association between social distancing measures and loneliness is moderated by sociodemographic characteristics. Data were from the fourth wave (April 29 to May 26, 2020) of the nationally representative Understanding America Study (UAS) COVID-19 Survey. We used data on adults 50 years or older (N = 3,283). Multivariate logistic regression models of loneliness were examined to test the independent effects of social distancing measures and their interaction with sociodemographic characteristics on loneliness. Four indicators of social distancing measures were considered: (a) avoiding public spaces, gatherings, or crowds, (b) canceling or postponing social activities, (c) social visits, (d) close contact (within 6 feet) with others. Cancelling or postponing social activities and avoiding close contact with other people were associated with 36% and 41% greater odds of loneliness, respectively. Furthermore, males and non-Hispanic Whites who had no close contact with others had a significantly greater probability of reporting loneliness than those who had contact. Our findings emphasize the heterogeneous nature of COVID-19 related experiences across subpopulations of older adults and call special attention to vulnerable groups that may be more impacted by the challenge of COVID-19 social distancing.","Choi, Eun Young; Farina, Matthew; Wu, Qiao; Ailshire, Jennifer",Innov Aging,100,17

Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) is a soluble secreted protein that can antagonize Fas ligand (FasL)-induced apoptosis and promote tumorigenesis. It remains unclear whether TIPE can regulate DcR3 expression. In this study, we examined this question by analyzing the relationship between these factors in CRC. Bioinformatics and tissue microarrays were used to determine the expression of TIPE and DcR3 and their correlation in CRC. The expression of TIPE and DcR3 in colon cancer cells was detected. Plasma samples were collected from CRC patients, and DcR3 secretion was measured. Then, dual-luciferase reporter gene analysis was performed to assess the interaction between TIPE and DcR3. We exogenously altered TIPE expression and analyzed its function and influence on DcR3 secretion. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to stimulate TIPE-overexpressing HCT116 cells, and alterations in signaling pathways were detected. Additionally, inhibitors were used to confirm molecular mechanisms. We found that TIPE and DcR3 were highly expressed in CRC patients and that their expression levels were positively correlated. DcR3 was highly expressed in the plasma of cancer patients. We confirmed that TIPE and DcR3 were highly expressed in HCT116 cells. TIPE overexpression enhanced the transcriptional activity of the DcR3 promoter. TIPE activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to regulate the expression of DcR3, thereby promoting cell proliferation and migration and inhibiting apoptosis. In summary, TIPE and DcR3 are highly expressed in CRC, and both proteins are associated with poor prognosis. TIPE regulates DcR3 expression by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in CRC, thus promoting cell proliferation and migration and inhibiting apoptosis. These findings may have clinical significance and promise for applications in the treatment or prognostication of CRC.","Zhong, Mengya; Qiu, Xingfeng; Liu, Yu; Yang, Yan; Gu, Lei; Wang, Chenxi; Chen, Huiyu; Liu, Zhongchen; Miao, Jiayin; Zhuang, Guohong",Front Oncol,100,1

Two approaches for verification were used: 1) analysis of specific sentences from Russian National Corpus, 2) via crowdsourcing platform Yandex.Toloka. The idea was to find similarities and differences between the annotations made by the experts in RuSentiFrames and by non-experts from Yandex.Toloka, thus verifying the RuSentiFrames descriptions. The first approach showed that implicit information influences greatly on the author’s attitude and that the context plays crucial role. The second approach showed mostly the agreement between the expert’s and non-expert’s annotations in case of relations between the participants in sentiment frames, but the author’s attitudes were estimated differently in some cases.","Matueva, Irina; Loukachevitch, Natalia","Recent Trends in Analysis of Images, Social Networks and Texts",100,1

It traces the evolution of climate policy during four distinct historical phases. The first of these was the era of the so-called Celtic Tiger, which saw a rapid rise in emissions. The second was characterised by profound crisis of economy and polity, during which attention was diverted from climate policy but with a significant fall in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The third phase was the economic recovery, which in many ways was as unexpected in its speed and extent as the crash. During this period, Ireland’s emissions rebounded strongly, illustrating that Ireland’s emissions remain stubbornly coupled to economic growth. Fourth and finally, the chapter examines Irish climate policy since 2017, asking whether Ireland has left its laggard status behind. The chapter concludes with a reflection on the broader context that has shaped Ireland’s policy response to climate change.","Torney, Diarmuid",Ireland and the Climate Crisis,100,5

However, depending on their surface characteristics, NC accumulate serum factors, termed protein corona, which may affect their cellular binding. We have previously shown that NC coated with carbohydrates to enable biocompatibility triggered the lectin-dependent complement pathway, resulting in enhanced binding to B cells via complement receptor (CR)1/2. Here we show that such NC also engaged all types of splenic leukocytes known to express CR3 at a high rate when NC were pre-incubated with native mouse serum resulting in complement opsonization. By focusing on dendritic cells (DC) as an important antigen-presenting cell type, we show that CR3 was essential for binding/uptake of complement-opsonized NC, whereas CR4, which in mouse is specifically expressed by DC, played no role. Further, a minor B cell subpopulation (B-1), which is important for first-line pathogen responses, and co-expressed CR1/2 and CR3, in general, engaged NC to a much higher extent than normal B cells. Here, we identified CR-1/2 as necessary for binding of complement-opsonized NC, whereas CR3 was dispensable. Interestingly, the binding of complement-opsonized NC to both DC and B-1 cells affected the expression of activation markers. Our findings may have important implications for the design of nano-vaccines against infectious diseases, which codeliver pathogen-specific protein antigen and adjuvant, aimed to induce a broad adaptive cellular and humoral immune response by inducing cytotoxic T lymphocytes that kill infected cells and pathogen-neutralizing antibodies, respectively. Decoration of nano-vaccines either with carbohydrates to trigger complement activation in vivo or with active complement may result in concomitant targeting of DC and B cells and thereby may strongly enhance the extent of dual cellular/humoral immune responses.","Bednarczyk, Monika; Medina-Montano, Carolina; Fittler, Frederic Julien; Stege, Henner; Roskamp, Meike; Kuske, Michael; Langer, Christian; Vahldieck, Marco; Montermann, Evelyn; Tubbe, Ingrid; Röhrig, Nadine; Dzionek, Andrzej; Grabbe, Stephan; Bros, Matthias",Int J Mol Sci,100,5

With rapid release of surgical research, we wanted to ensure patients can access the right evidence to make informed decisions. We describe an innovative, digital, patient and public involvement (PPI) strategy designed to engage surgical patients with COVID-19 research as it is released, by producing accessible resources. METHODS: We established a Patient Advisory Group (PAG) to co-produce patient information about having surgery during the pandemic, and the risks of perioperative SARS-CoV-2, using information from the CovidSurg international surgical cohort studies. RESULTS: The PAG were keen for patients to understand the high risks of mortality and serious breathing complications associated with perioperative SARS-CoV-2. They wanted detailed information about what patients can do to stay safe and about the measures hospitals are taking to keep them safe. What patients wanted to know was not always what surgeons presupposed. We co-produced patient resources with separate versions for dyslexia and learning disabled patients. We published 18 translations within a few weeks and hosted them in purpose-built web pages. We generated PAG-approved lay summaries to share our original research findings with patients. CONCLUSION: Patients quickly adapted to engage in digital PPI activities during pandemic lockdown conditions. Collaborative working via teleconferencing and shared screens is a productive, inclusive and convenient way to rapidly develop patient information. Clinicians should invite critique and can expect patient engagement to enhance the content and acceptability of patient resources.","Venn, Mary L; Venn, Mary",BJS Open,100,1

To address this question, we develop a contingency-based model of perceived funding fit that delineates several factors that influence strategic fund-seeking decisions by entrepreneurs. In prior research, entrepreneur fund-seeking has largely been explained using models that rely on rule-based approaches (e.g., the pecking order assumption) or value capture considerations. In contrast, we propose a dynamic contingency-based model that delineates several factors that influence entrepreneur perceptions of funding fit over and above transactional efficiency, including atypical value creation from the fundraising process itself and external stakeholder values. We inductively assess our model in the context of equity crowdfunding (ECF) and find that perceived funding fit can motivate some strategic fund-seekers to opt to pursue ECF, even when they have a reasonable opportunity to obtain other more established sources of funding such as angel or seed-stage venture capital. This indicates that ECF in several cases is not a funding mode of last resort as proposed in prior literature. Plain English Summary Raising capital is a complex and dynamic process. Strategic entrepreneurs seek “funding fit” for their particular ventures leading some to opt for less established forms of funding such as equity crowdfunding for a variety of reasons beyond efficiency. Prior venture funding research has largely taken the view of the investor, emphasizing what entrepreneurs must do to win the favor of angel investors and other seed funders, and deeming equity crowdfunding (ECF) a funding mode of last resort for discouraged entrepreneurs. Inductively analyzing hundreds of regulatory filings, entrepreneur interviews, public information, and media pieces about ECF-funded firms, we find evidence that in several cases, strategic entrepreneurs may prefer to opt for ECF if they perceive it to be a better fit due to novel forms of nonfinancial value. We explain our findings by proposing an emergent contingency-based model of “funding fit.”","Stevenson, Regan; McMahon, Sean R.; Letwin, Chaim; Ciuchta, Michael P.",Small Bus Econ,100,24

METHODS: This is a web-based survey (conducted from November 2020 to January 2021), which invited (via social media WhatsApp) PLWH registered at a University-based specialized outpatient clinic. With multiple-choice questions, the virtual questionnaire included sociodemographic, lifestyle, and COVID-19-related information, before and during CRSD. Dietary practices questions, adapted from a Brazilian epidemiological study, inquired about beans, vegetables, fruits and fruit juices, red and white meat, soft drinks, sweets, and salty snacks. Habits such as cooking, and home-delivered meals were also investigated. Data were analyzed by descriptive aspects, as well as Chi-square and Cochrane-Q association tests (with P-value < 0.05). RESULTS: The sample included 407 PLWH, 68.8% men, 50.7(±9.8) years old, 73.2% with a high educational level. Being employed was referred by 65.8%, from which 30.7% was working remotely; 45.4% mentioned reduction of their incomes during CRSD. The recommendation for CRSD was followed by 90.4% of the respondents, and 14.5% reported total isolation. Only 9.1% referred COVID-19 diagnostic with 1.2% hospitalizations. The CRSD was significantly associated with working remotely (P = 0.02), but not with age (P = 0.62), schooling (P = 0.61), or income (P = 0.46). Regarding food habits, the participants significantly reduced the intake of raw (P < 0.001) and cooked (P = 0.004) vegetables and red meat (P < 0.001). Otherwise, the intake of soft drinks (P = 0.001), sweets (P < 0.001), and salty snacks (P < 0.001) were significantly increased. Cooking at home increased 46.4%, and home-delivered meals did not change. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of PLWH followed the CRSD; COVID-19 diagnostic, as well as hospitalizations, were rare. However, the increased intake of unhealthy, ultra-processed foods and the reduced intake of vegetables showed disagreements with HIV-directed guidelines. As a suggestion, on-line messages on healthy eating maybe would prevent future health worsening of PLWH due to CRSD.

Screening is necessary for early diagnosis and treatment, which reduces morbidity and mortality across all three illnesses. We evaluated testing uptake for HIV, viral hepatitis, and tuberculosis in Kisumu, Kenya. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from adults aged 18–35 years who enrolled in a prospective HIV incidence cohort study from February 2017 to May 2018 were analyzed. A questionnaire was administered to each participant at screening for study eligibility to collect behavioral characteristics and to assess prior testing practices. Among participants without a history of previously-diagnosed HIV, multivariable robust Poisson regression was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for factors potentially associated with HIV testing in the 12 months prior to enrollment. A hierarchical model was used to test for differential access to testing due to spatial location. RESULTS: Of 671 participants, 52 (7.7%) were living with HIV, 308 (45.9%) were female, and the median age was 24 (interquartile range 21–28) years. Among 651 (97.0%) who had ever been tested for HIV, 400 (61.2%) reported HIV testing in the past 6 months, 129 (19.7%) in the past 6–12 months, and 125 (19.1%) more than one year prior to enrollment. Any prior testing for viral hepatitis was reported by 8 (1.2%) participants and for tuberculosis by 51 (7.6%). In unadjusted models, HIV testing in the past year was more common among females (PR 1.08 [95% CI 1.01, 1.17]) and participants with secondary education or higher (PR 1.10 [95% CI 1.02, 1.19]). In the multivariable model, only secondary education or higher was associated with recent HIV testing (adjusted PR 1.10 [95% CI 1.02, 1.20]). Hierarchical models showed no geographic differences in HIV testing across Kisumu subcounties. CONCLUSIONS: Prior HIV testing was common among study participants and most had been tested within the past year but testing for tuberculosis and viral hepatitis was far less common. HIV testing gaps exist for males and those with lower levels of education. HIV testing infrastructure could be leveraged to increase access to testing for other endemic infectious diseases.","Tunnage, Joshua; Yates, Adam; Nwoga, Chiaka; Sing’oei, Valentine; Owuoth, John; Polyak, Christina S.; Crowell, Trevor A.",BMC Public Health,100,5

To date, there are no approved efficacious treatments targeting SARS‐CoV‐2, with current tactics (e.g. modulating the host response & using repurposed medications) having mixed results. Thus, alongside vaccines, additional treatments to target viral infection are critical to fight the pandemic. SARS‐CoV‐2 uses its spike protein to bind to ACE2 on host cells. Therefore, developing a target to bind spike could prevent viral infection. We previously published on the development and testing of recombinant rod domain of vimentin (rhRod) to bind to P‐selectin to block leukocyte adhesion to platelets and endothelium. Given that the SARS‐CoV spike protein (which shares 76% sequence identity to SARS‐CoV‐2 spike) binds to vimentin, we hypothesized that rhRod would bind to SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein to block viral adhesion. We used biolayer interferometry (OctetRed(384)) to measure the K(D) of rhRod (0‐1000 nM) to immobilized SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein (S1S2ECD‐His). We found that rhRod had a strong affinity to the spike protein (180 ± 23 nM; R(2) 0.9858; Fig. 1 A‐B). Heat inactivation (100°C for 10 minutes) of rhRod (ΔrhRod) did not bind to spike protein (indeterminate; R(2) 0; Fig. 1 C‐D). We then tested whether rhRod blocked ACE2 from binding to spike protein using 2 methods (Fig. 1 E‐F). Immobilized spike protein sensors were first placed in rhRod (0‐1000 nM) containing wells then placed into wells with 200 nM ACE2. The IC(50) of rhRod was 139 ± 17 nM (R(2) 0.9959). A separate series of experiments were done using immobilized ACE2 sensors placed in wells containing 125 nM spike protein mixed with increasing concentrations of rhRod (0‐500 nM). As the concentration of rhRod increased, binding to ACE2 sensors decreased, with an IC(50) of 34 ± 8 nM (R(2) 0.9845). Based on our findings, we used in silico modeling (SwarmDock) to asses the predicted interactions between rhRod and spike. We found that rhRod was predicted to bind to spike protein in the same region as ACE2, consistent with our empirical data that rhRod blocks spike‐ACE2 interactions. Finally, to test whether rhRod decreased SARS‐CoV‐2 replication, we infected Vero E6 cells with SARS‐CoV‐2 (USA‐WA1/2020; MOI 0.1) in the presence of rhRod (0‐4,000 nM). Daily administration of rhRod decreased viral replication (PFU/mL) by 100‐1000‐fold (1000‐4000 nM) starting at 48 hours, through 96 hours (segmental linear regression with least squares fit; Fig. 1G). ΔrhRod (4000 nM) had no effect on viral replication. Our data show that rhRod binds to spike protein to block spike‐ACE2 interactions and decreases SARS‐CoV‐2 viral replication in vitro. Data from these studies will inform preclinical models of COVID‐19 to further develop a potential novel therapy for this devastating disease.","Lam, Fong; Brown, Cameron; Ronca, Shannon",FASEB J,100,1

Research on level walking with feedback on load-related parameters has provided innovative treatment possibilities. With regard to walking on sloped surfaces, fundamental biomechanical knowledge exists. However, comprehensive data on the agreement of kinematics and kinetics of self-paced ramp versus sloped treadmill walking is lacking. Further, deeper insights into the control of the dFLA during decline walking and the usefulness of real-time feedback are missing. METHODS/DESIGN: Thirty healthy participants aged between 18 and 35 years will be included. They will complete a three-dimensional gait analysis walking self-paced up and down on a 5-m ramp with a 10° inclination. Subsequently, speed-matched to ramp-up walking and self-paced 10° incline split-belt treadmill walking will be assessed. Afterwards, the participants will be observed under four different conditions of 10° declined walking on the same treadmill (a) self-paced walking, (b) self-paced walking with an internal focus of attention, (c) self-paced walking with real-time feedback, and (d) condition c speed-matched walking. The primary outcome parameter will be the frontal knee range of motion (fKROM). Secondary outcomes include the ground reaction force loading rate, spatial-temporal parameters, as well as sagittal, frontal and transversal kinematics, and kinetics for the lower extremities. DISCUSSION: The findings aim at improving the understanding of the effects of real-time feedback on the control of the dFLA and lower limb loading. Following clinical practicable methods for effective feedback devices can be developed and evaluated. Additionally, the first dataset comparing kinematic and kinetic parameters for decline and incline ramp walking versus walking on an instrumented treadmill will be available for appropriate intervention planning.

In this study, we use zebrafish to understand how aging and exercise affect cardiomyocyte turnover and myocardial remodelling. We show that cardiomyocyte proliferation remains constant throughout life but that onset of fibrosis is associated with a late increase in apoptosis. These findings correlate with decreases in voluntary swimming activity, critical swimming speed (Ucrit), and increases in biomarkers of cardiac insufficiency. The ability to respond to severe physiological stress is also impaired with age. Although young adult fish respond with robust cardiomyocyte proliferation in response to enforced swimming, this is dramatically impaired in older fish and served by a smaller proliferation-competent cardiomyocyte population. Finally, we show that these aging responses can be improved through increased activity throughout adulthood. However, despite improvement in Ucrit and the proliferative response to stress, the size of the proliferating cardiomyocyte population remained unchanged. The zebrafish heart models human aging and reveals the important trade-off between preserving cardiovascular fitness through exercise at the expense of accelerated fibrotic change.","Murphy, Lindsay B.; Santos-Ledo, Adrian; Dhanaseelan, Tamilvendhan; Eley, Lorraine; Burns, David; Henderson, Deborah J.; Chaudhry, Bill",Dis Model Mech,100,1

By using the health belief model (HBM), this study aims to examine the effectiveness of HBM on the flood-risk reduction (FRR) educational intervention by looking into the perceived susceptibility, severity, benefit and self-efficacy among elementary school children in Malaysia. This study utilised the one-group pre-test–post-test design by recruiting 224 elementary school children in the pre-FRR educational intervention programme, and 205 who undertook a post-intervention programme a month later. This study showed that the FRR educational intervention significantly improved (p < 0.001) the overall HBM components during the post-intervention, particularly in: (1) FRR knowledge, (2) perceived susceptibility, (3) perceived severity and (4) perceived benefits. The one-way analysis of covariance test showed that knowledge transfer intervention is effective to improve all the HBM components that include (1) FRR knowledge, F(38,127) = 2.517; (2) perceived susceptibility, F(6,191) = 6.957; (3) perceived severity, F(20,163) = 2.944; (4) perceived benefits, F(25,153) = 2.342 and (5) self-efficacy, F(7,189) = 12.526. The impact of integrating HBM into knowledge transfer intervention was seen to be effective and provide a positive knowledge enhancement among learners.

In the present COVID-19 pandemic, luciferase-based biosensors are already playing a critical role in the study of the culprit virus SARS-CoV-2 as well as in the development of serological assays and drug development via high-throughput screening. In this review paper, we provide a summary of existing luciferase-based biosensors and their applications in virology.","Azad, Taha; Janse van Rensburg, Helena J.; Morgan, Jessica; Rezaei, Reza; Crupi, Mathieu J.

Medical student burnout is associated with many factors such as academic pressure, sleep deprivation, exposure to patient suffering, and high academic demand. In this study, we assessed the prevalence of burnout symptoms among preclinical and clinical medical students studying at Qassim University in Qassim, Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-six subjects entered the final data analysis with a majority between 18 and 24 years of age, of whom 56.5% was females and 43.5% was males. The overall burnout prevalence was 8%. The female gender was a significant predictor of emotional exhaustion and personal efficacy, (OR = 2.510; 95% Cl [1.845–3.415]; p value 0.000) and (OR = 1.434; 95% Cl [1.086–1.866]; p value 0.010), respectively.

The dissatisfaction of physicians might lead to lower health-care quality.[6] Moreover, patient satisfaction is strongly affected by physician satisfaction.[78] This study aims to measure job satisfaction among family medicine (FM) physicians in Saudi Arabia. STUDY DESIGN: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 265 FM physicians working in Saudi Arabia to participate in an online survey between October 2019 and January 2019. RESULTS: Results showed that more than 50% of the respondents were very satisfied with their career choice (55.5%, n = 147). Non-Saudis who were satisfied or strongly satisfied were higher than those of Saudis (P = 0.035) and 2.45 times more likely to be dissatisfied compared to non-Saudi respondents. Respondents from the southern region were 81% less likely to be dissatisfied than respondents from the central region (OR = 0.19, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Family medicine physicians showed a high level of satisfaction with their career choice regardless of gender, age, sector public or private, marital status. This is promising for family medicine as a medical specialty.

However, much of what is known about the economic impacts of obesity comes from high-income countries and studies are not readily comparable due to methodological differences. Our objective is to demonstrate a method for estimating current and future national economic impacts of obesity and apply it across a sample of heterogeneous contexts globally. METHODS: We estimated economic impacts of overweight and obesity for eight countries using a cost-of-illness approach. Direct and indirect costs of obesity from 2019 to 2060 were estimated from a societal perspective as well as the effect of two hypothetical scenarios of obesity prevalence projections. Country-specific data were sourced from published studies and global databases. RESULTS: In per capita terms, costs of obesity in 2019 ranged from US$17 in India to US$940 in Australia. These economic costs are comparable to 1.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) on average across the eight countries, ranging from 0.8% of GDP in India to 2.4% in Saudi Arabia. By 2060, with no significant changes to the status quo, the economic impacts from obesity are projected to grow to 3.6% of GDP on average ranging from 2.4% of GDP in Spain to 4.9% of GDP in Thailand. Reducing obesity prevalence by 5% from projected levels or keeping it at 2019 levels will translate into an average annual reduction of 5.2% and 13.2% in economic costs, respectively, between 2020 and 2060 across the eight countries. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that the economic impacts of obesity are substantial across countries, irrespective of economic or geographical context and will increase over time if current trends continue. These findings strongly point to the need for advocacy to increase awareness of the societal impacts of obesity, and for policy actions to address the systemic roots of obesity.","Okunogbe, Adeyemi; Nugent, Rachel; Spencer, Garrison; Ralston, Johanna; Wilding, John",BMJ Glob Health,100,16

In developed economies, institutions and organizations, both public and private, are called upon to reflect on new organizational models of work and human resource management, which - in fact - should offer workers sufficient flexibility in adapting their work schedules remotely to their personal (and family) needs. This study aims to explore, within a Job Demands-Resources framework, whether and to what extent job demands (workload and social isolation), organizational job resources (perceived organizational support), and personal resources (self-efficacy, vision about the future and commitment to organizational change) have affected workers’ quality of life during the pandemic, taking into account the potential mediating role of job satisfaction and perceived stress. Using data from a sample of 293 workers, we estimate measurement and structural models, according to the Item Response Theory and the Path analysis frameworks, which allow us to operationalize the latent traits and study the complex structure of relationships between the latent dimensions. We inserted in the model as control variables, the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the respondents, with particular emphasis on gender differences and the presence and age of children. The study offers insights into the relationship between remote work and quality of life, and the need to rethink human resource management policies considering the opportunities and critical issues highlighted by working full-time remotely.","Barbieri, Barbara; Balia, Silvia; Sulis, Isabella; Cois, Ester; Cabras, Cristina; Atzara, Sara; De Simone, Silvia",Front Psychol,100,1

To identify patients who specifically benefit from fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab, we developed integrative models including established prognostic parameters and gene expression profiling. Gene expression profiling was conducted on n=337 CLL8 trial samples, ""core"" probe sets were summarized on gene levels and RMA normalized. Prognostic models were built using penalized Cox proportional hazards models with the smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty. We identified a prognostic signature of less than a dozen genes, which substituted for established prognostic factors, including TP53 and immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene mutation status. Independent prognostic impact was confirmed for treatment, β2-microglobulin and del(17p) regarding overall survival and for treatment, del(11q), del(17p) and SF3B1 mutation for progression-free survival. The combination of independent prognostic and gene expression profiling variables performed equal to models including only established non-gene expression profiling variables. Gene expression profiling variables showed higher prognostic accuracy for patients with long progression-free survival compared to categorical variables like the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene mutation status and reliably predicted overall survival in CLL8 and an independent cohort.

In some individuals, these reinforcing rewards can induce maladaptive, problematic social media use, with symptoms similar to substance use disorders. This problematic social media use has been associated with poorer mental health. Previous studies have demonstrated that social support can protect against poor mental health. People can receive social support both in real-life and on social media, however, so we investigated whether these two types of social support mediate the relationship between problematic social media use and poor mental health. We conducted an online survey, collecting measures of problematic social media use and mental health (depression, anxiety, and social isolation), as well as measures of real-life social support and social support received on social media. We then performed a path analysis on these data. Our analysis revealed that problematic social media use was significantly associated with decreased real-life social support and increased social support on social media. Importantly, real-life social support was then associated with reduced depression, anxiety, and social isolation, while social support on social media was not associated with these mental health measures.

This non-inferiority trial aims to compare SILC with conventional four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) with postoperative pain as the primary endpoint. METHODS We aim to randomize 100 patients into equal arms of SILC or LC. Exclusion criteria were: (i) acute cholecystitis; (ii) an ASA score of 3 or above; (iii) bleeding disorders; or (iv) previous upper abdominal surgery. Patients and postoperative assessors were blinded to the procedure received. The site and severity of pain was compared based on the visual analogue scale at 4 hours, 24 hours and 14 days postoperatively; non-inferiority was assumed when the lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval of the difference was above -1, and superiority when P ≤ 0.05. RESULTS We recruited 24 SILC and 26 LC patients. There were no conversions to open cholecystectomy or from SILC to LC. SILC was non-inferior for pain at umbilical sites at rest and at extra-umbilical sites at all times. At 24 hours postoperatively, SILC was associated with significantly less pain at extra-umbilical sites (rest: P = 0.002; movement: P = 0.004). There were no incidents of biliary injury or retained gallstones. Of the 24 SILC patients, 12.5% had postoperative complications (vomiting, mild fluid overload, wound infection) compared with 0% of LC patients (P = 0.110); all complications resolved with conservative management. Operating time, analgesic use, return to function, and overall satisfaction did not differ significantly between the two groups.

AIM OF THE ARTICLE The aim was to present the actions, instructions and procedures introduced at the A-BSM to provide information how to deal with pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in institutions taking care of cultural heritage before and after closure of the Museum for visitors and after reopening. MATERIALS AND METHODS The described activities were developed at the Museum by a specially established Expert Team. RESULTS Groups of employees and places in which they were most exposed to contact with visitors and, as a consequence, at the highest risk of getting infected, were characterised. The employees were provided with personal protective equipment, and at the Museum site, devices essential for maintaining the microbiological cleanliness of the rooms, were placed. In the next stage, instructions and procedures for particular groups of employees were prepared. Visitors were educated about the need of taking precautions and were allowed to disinfect in several places at the Memorial Site. Steps to reduce attendance at this time has also been taken. Procedures for employees of the A-BSM were developed in such way that they can also be used after reopening of the Museum for visitors. CONCLUSIONS The actions which ensured the microbiological safety of the A-BSM employees, brought satisfying results. In more than 21 days after closing of the Museum for visitors, no cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 were found among employees, despite a very high threat.","Wawrzyk, Anna; Rybitwa, Dorota; Cywiński, Piotr; Pióro, Rafał; Łobacz, Michał",Przeglad epidemiologiczny,100,27

The high effectiveness of the widely administered BNT162b vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech in preventing not only the disease but also infection with SARS-CoV-2 suggests a potential for a population-level effect, which is critical for disease eradication. However, this putative effect is difficult to observe, especially in light of highly fluctuating spatiotemporal epidemic dynamics. Here, by analyzing vaccination records and test results collected during the rapid vaccine rollout in a large population from 177 geographically defined communities, we find that the rates of vaccination in each community are associated with a substantial later decline in infections among a cohort of individuals aged under 16 years, who are unvaccinated. On average, for each 20 percentage points of individuals who are vaccinated in a given population, the positive test fraction for the unvaccinated population decreased approximately twofold. These results provide observational evidence that vaccination not only protects individuals who have been vaccinated but also provides cross-protection to unvaccinated individuals in the community.","Milman, Oren; Yelin, Idan; Aharony, Noga; Katz, Rachel; Herzel, Esma; Ben-Tov, Amir; Kuint, Jacob; Gazit, Sivan; Chodick, Gabriel; Patalon, Tal; Kishony, Roy",Nature medicine,100,31

The population were divided into three compartments: Susceptible, Infected, Removed. Susceptible transitions to Infected every hour with a probability determined by the ratio of Infected and the congestion of area. The total area consists of three zones crowded zone, mid zone and uncrowded zone, with different infection probabilities characterized by the number of people gathered there. The time for each people to spend in the crowded zone is curtailed by 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 hours, and the time spent in mid zone is extended accordingly. This simulation showed that the number of Infected and Removed will increase rapidly if there is no reduction of the time spent in crowded zone. On the other hand, the stagnant growth of Infected can be observed when the time spent in the crowded zone is reduced to 4 hours, and the growth number of Infected will decrease and the spread of the infection will subside gradually if the time spent in the crowded zone is further cut to 2 hours. In conclusions The infection spread in Japan will be gradually contained by reducing the time spent in the crowded zone to less than 4 hours.","Karako, Kenji; Song, Peipei; Chen, Yu; Tang, Wei",Bioscience trends,100,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS One thousand seven hundred and thirty-eight patients, collected in a prospectively held database from 2008 to 2016, were retrospectively analyzed. The correlation between postoperative leakage and both preoperative (age, gender, height, weight, BMI, and obesity-related morbidities) and operative variables (the distance from pylorus at which the gastric section was started, operative time, experience of surgeons who performed the LSG, and the surgical materials used) was analyzed. The experience of the surgeons was calculated in the number of LSGs performed. The surgical materials considered were stapler, cartridges, and reinforcement of the suture. RESULTS Proximal leakage was observed in 45 patients out of 1738 (2.6%). No correlation was found between leakage and the preoperative variables analyzed. The operative variables that were found to be associated with lower incidence of leakage at the multivariate analysis (p < 0.05) were the reinforcement of the staple line (or overriding suture or buttressing materials) and the experience of the surgeons. A distance of less than 2 cm from the pylorus resulted to be significantly related to a higher incidence of fistula at the univariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS In this large consecutive cohort study of LSG, proximal staple line reinforcement (buttress material or suture) reduced the risk of a leak. The risk of a proximal leak was much higher in the surgeons first 100 cases, which has implications for training and supervision during this ""learning curve"" period.","Cesana, Giovanni; Cioffi, Stefano; Giorgi, Riccardo; Villa, Roberta; Uccelli, Matteo; Ciccarese, Francesca; Castello, Giorgio; Scotto, Bruno; Olmi, Stefano",Obesity surgery,100,17

Here, we investigated the relationship between prevalence of Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) and Fusobacteriales, CMS/CRIS subtyping, cell type composition, immune infiltrates and host contexture to refine patient stratification and to identify druggable context-specific vulnerabilities. DESIGN We coupled cell culture experiments with characterisation of Fn/Fusobacteriales prevalence and host biology/microenviroment in tumours from two independent colorectal cancer patient cohorts (Taxonomy: n=140, colon and rectal cases of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-COAD-READ) cohort: n=605). RESULTS In vitro, Fn infection induced inflammation via nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells/tumour necrosis factor alpha in HCT116 and HT29 cancer cell lines. In patients, high Fn/Fusobacteriales were found in CMS1, microsatellite unstable () tumours, with infiltration of M1 macrophages, reduced M2 macrophages, and high interleukin (IL)-6/IL-8/IL-1β signalling. Analysis of the Taxonomy cohort suggested that Fn was prognostic for CMS4/CRIS-B patients, despite having lower Fn load than CMS1 patients. In the TCGA-COAD-READ cohort, we likewise identified a differential association between Fusobacteriales relative abundance and outcome when stratifying patients in mesenchymal (either CMS4 and/or CRIS-B) versus non-mesenchymal (neither CMS4 nor CRIS-B). Patients with mesenchymal tumours and high Fusobacteriales had approximately twofold higher risk of worse outcome. These associations were null in non-mesenchymal patients. Modelling the three-way association between Fusobacteriales prevalence, molecular subtyping and host contexture with logistic models with an interaction term disentangled the pathogen-host signalling relationship and identified aberrations (including NOTCH, CSF1-3 and IL-6/IL-8) as candidate targets. CONCLUSION This study identifies CMS4/CRIS-B patients with high Fn/Fusobacteriales prevalence as a high-risk subpopulation that may benefit from therapeutics targeting mesenchymal biology.","Salvucci, Manuela; Crawford, Nyree; Stott, Katie; Bullman, Susan; Longley, Daniel B; Prehn, Jochen H M",Gut,100,1

A total of 746 potentially relevant studies were identified, and four RCTs met our inclusion criteria. All of the included RCTs had a high risk of bias across their domains. Three RCTs showed favourable effects of DSS on response rate compared with conventional medicine, and a meta-analysis showed that DSS had superior effects compared to analgesics (RR: 1.31, 95%CI, 1.06-1.63, I(2)=73%). One RCT showed a beneficial effect of DSS on pain compared with placebo control.

It is an important consequence of the aging adult population, generating a plethora of spine-related interventions with variable treatment efficacy and consistently high costs. Recent years have witnessed more than a threefold increase in the prevalence and treatment of ASD, and further increases over the coming decades are expected with the growing elderly population worldwide. The ability to monitor and assess clinical outcomes has not kept pace with these developments. This paper addresses the pressing need to provide a set of common outcome metrics for this growing group of patients with back pain and other disabilities due to an adult spinal deformity. METHODS The standard outcome set was created by a panel with global representation, using a thorough modified Delphi procedure. The three-tiered outcome hierarchy (Porter) was used as a framework to capture full cycle of care. The standardized language of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (WHO-ICF) was used. RESULTS Consensus was reached on a core set of 25 WHO-ICF outcome domains ('What to measure'); on the accompanying globally available clinician and patient reported measurement instruments and definitions ('How to measure'), and on the timing of the measurements ('When to measure'). The current work has brought to light domains not routinely reported in the spinal literature (such as pulmonary function, return to work, social participation), and domains for which no adequate instruments have yet been identified (such as how to clinically quantify in routine practice lumbar spinal stenosis, neurogenic claudication, radicular pain, and loss of lower extremity motor function). CONCLUSION A standard outcome set was developed for patients undergoing treatment for adult spinal deformity using globally available outcome metrics. The current framework can be considered a reference for further work, and may provide a starting point for routine methodical and systematic monitoring of outcomes. Post-COVID e-health may accelerate the routine capture of these types of data.","de Kleuver, Marinus; Faraj, Sayf S A; Haanstra, Tsjitske M; Wright, Anna K; Polly, David W; van Hooff, Miranda L; Glassman, Steven D",Spine deformity,100,16

The Configured Fireside Simulator (CFS) is a software simulator, originally developed for the Department of Defense to evaluate operations of the chemical demilitarization incinerators processing the chemical warfare agent stockpile of the US. The software was later adapted for use by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide for the ability to run ""what if"" scenarios of waste streams contaminated with chemical/biological (CB) threat agents in four specific incinerators, including the EPA's pilot-scale Rotary Kiln Incinerator Simulator (RKIS) facility, as well as three commercial incinerators based on design criteria for actual operating facilities. These commercial incinerators include a Medical/Pathological Waste Incinerator, a Hazardous Waste Burning Rotary Kiln, and a Waste-to-Energy Stoker-type combustor. The CFS uses three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics coupled with detailed chemical kinetic data for destruction of chemical warfare agents, coupled with kinetic data for biological agent destruction derived from bench- and pilot-scale experiments to predict the way agent-containing materials will behave under full-scale combustion conditions in several different incinerator types. The objective of this paper is to describe the CFS software, how it works, and potential applications of this software to real-world situations. This software could be a valuable tool for researchers, regulators, and industry to evaluate potential operating conditions to help guide testing activities and develop operational scenarios for difficult-to-manage waste streams. Although this software has been under development for several years, this paper represents the software's first introduction to the scientific community in the peer-reviewed literature.","Lemieux, Paul; Boe, Timothy; Tschursin, Anna; Denison, Martin; Davis, Kevin; Swensen, Dave",Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association,100,17

Effective treatment of vasospasm is therefore one of the main priorities for these patients. We report about a case series of continuous intra-arterial infusion of the calcium channel antagonist nimodipine for 1-5 days on the intensive care unit. METHODS In thirty patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and refractory vasospasm continuous infusion of nimodipine was started on the neurosurgical intensive care unit. The effect of nimodipine on brain perfusion, cerebral blood flow, brain tissue oxygenation, and blood flow velocity in cerebral arteries was monitored. RESULTS Based on Hunt & Hess grades on admission, 83% survived in a good clinical condition and 23% recovered without an apparent neurological deficit. Persistent ischemic areas were seen in 100% of patients with GOS 1-3 and in 69% of GOS 4-5 patients. Regional cerebral blood flow and computed tomography perfusion scanning showed adequate correlation with nimodipine application and angiographic vasospasm. Transcranial Doppler turned out to be unreliable with interexaminer variance and failure of detecting vasospasm or missing the improvement. CONCLUSION Local continuous intra-arterial nimodipine treatment for refractory cerebral vasospasm after aSAH can be recommended as a low-risk treatment in addition to established endovascular therapies.","Ott, Stephanie; Jedlicka, Sheila; Wolf, Stefan; Peter, Mozes; Pudenz, Christine; Merker, Patrick; Schürer, Ludwig; Lumenta, Christianto Benjamin",BioMed research international,100,17

Based on a preliminary study of human periosteum allografts from this laboratory, the present work has extensively investigated the use of human cadaveric tissue-engineered periosteum-allograft constructs as an approach to healing such serious orthopedic surgical situations. In this current report, human cadaveric periosteum-wrapped bone allografts and counterpart controls without periosteum were implanted subcutaneously in athymic mice (nu/nu) for 10, 20, and, for the first time, 40 weeks. Specimens were then harvested and assessed by histological and gene expression analyses. Compared to controls, the presence of new bone formation and resorption in periosteum-allograft constructs was indicated in both histology and gene expression results over 40 weeks of implantation. Of several genes also examined for the first time, RANKL and SOST expression levels increased in a statistically significant manner, data suggesting that bone formation and the presence of increasing numbers of osteocytes in bone matrices had increased with time. The tissue-engineering strategy described in this study provides a possible means of improving delayed-union or non-union at the healing sites of segmental bone defects or bone fractures. The potential of periosteum and its resident cells could thereby be utilized effectively in tissue-engineering methods and tissue regenerative medicine.","Yu, Qing; DiFeo Jacquet, Robin; Landis, William J","Cells, tissues, organs",100,1

The histone deacetylases (HDAC) are associated with a large number of immune diseases. This study tests a hypothesis that the interaction between VitD and HDAC is associated with the regulation of epithelial barrier functions. In this study, human intestinal epithelial cell line, T84 cells, was cultured into monolayers to be used as a model to test the epithelial barrier functions. We observed that in a VitD-deficient environment, the T84 monolayer barrier function was compromised. Exposure to calcitriol (the active form of VitD3) in the culture increased the expression of VitD receptor (VDR) in T84 cells. In a VitD-sufficient environment, VDR formed a complex with histone deacetylase-11 (HDAC11); the complex was markedly decreased in a VitD-deficient environment. We also observed that significantly more binding of HDAC11 to the promoter of the tight junction proteins inhibit the gene transcription activities of these loci in the VitD-deficient environment, which were abolished by the presence of calcitriol in the culture. In conclusion, the interaction between VDR and HDAC11 plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the epithelial barrier integrity.","Liu, Feng-Hua; Li, Shan-Shan; Li, Xiao-Xi; Wang, Shuai; Li, Mao-Gang; Guan, Li; Luan, Tian-Gang; Liu, Zhi-Gang; Liu, Zhan-Ju; Yang, Ping-Chang",Oncotarget,100,1

The importance and the evolutionary advantage of these pathways can be seen as many remain unchanged by animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria. In eukaryotes, the metabolic pathways occur within the cytosol and mitochondria of cells with the utilisation of glucose or fatty acids providing the majority of cellular energy in animals. Metabolism is organised into distinct metabolic pathways to either maximise the capture of energy or minimise its use. Metabolism can be split into a series of chemical reactions that comprise both the synthesis and degradation of complex macromolecules known as anabolism or catabolism, respectively.

Children with this disease are more susceptible to respiratory infections due to the limitation in mucociliary transport and anatomical disruption of the bronchial tree. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, a respiratory illness related to exacerbations of chronic pulmonary pathologies in children, such as CF and asthma. There are not enough case reports on pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and CF, for which we share our experience. Case report A 22-month-old male patient diagnosed with CF presented in the hospital with cough, fever, and increased respiratory work. The patient received supplemental oxygen and antibiotic and antiviral therapy. Positive results for type B influenza and RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) for SARS-CoV-2 were obtained. Due to the persistence of respiratory difficulty, high-flow therapy was initiated, with a good response. After an episode of hypoxemia, bradycardia, and increased respiratory work secondary to accumulated secretions, orotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation were performed. The patient evolved with clinical and gasometric improvement. After 10 days of in-hospital antibiotic management with adequate clinical evolution, the patient was discharged to complete oral treatment and home isolation. Conclusions We present a case of chronic respiratory disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection with severity criteria in a pediatric patient.

METHODS Donors who underwent living donor right from May 2013 to October 2017 were included. Comparisons between laparoscopy and open surgery were performed using Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney test, chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, and linear-by-linear association. RESULTS Among 305 donors, 100 and 205 underwent laparoscopy and open surgery, respectively. The laparoscopy group had more type I (95.0%) bile ducts than the open group (59.5%, P<0.001) and had longer operation time (378.2 ± 93.5 minutes vs. 329.1 ± 68.0 minutes, P<0.001), while estimated blood loss was smaller (298.3 ± 162.9 mL vs. 344.3 ± 149.9 mL, P=0.015). Although Clavien-Dindo grade IIIb complication was higher in the laparoscopy (n=4, 4.0%) compared to the open group (0.0%, P=0.011), it was only significant in the initial 25 cases (8.0%, P=0.011), and became comparable afterwards. Furthermore, grade IIIb complication was comparable when type I bile duct donors were selected (P=0.072).

After therapy, CE findings among the 24 cases were as follows: villous edema (19 cases); erythema (17 cases); angioectasia (16 cases); erosions (12 cases); and EVs (9 cases), and no observable abnormalities in 2 cases. On multivariate analysis, exacerbation of EVs and PHG were independent predictors of PHE exacerbation. CONCLUSION EVs and PHG exacerbation may predict PHE exacerbation in patients with LC.","Kunihara, Sayoko; Oka, Shiro; Tanaka, Shinji; Otani, Ichiro; Igawa, Atsushi; Nagaoki, Yuko; Aikata, Hiroshi; Chayama, Kazuaki",Digestion,100,7

According to the theory of ""embodied cognition,"" the semantic content of cognitive processes is represented by multimodal networks in the brain, which include body-related functions. Such multimodal representations could offer a mechanism, which explains mutual influences between cognition and sleep. Here we tested whether sleep-related words are represented in multimodal networks by examining the effect of congruent versus incongruent body positions on word processing during wakefulness. We experimentally manipulated the body position of 66 subjects (19-40 years old) between standing upright and lying down. Sleep- and activity-related words were presented around the individual speech recognition threshold. Our results show that word processing was facilitated in congruent body positions (sleep words: lying down and activity words: standing upright) compared with incongruent body positions, as indicated by a reduced N400 in the congruent condition with the lowest volume. In addition, early sensory components of the ERP (N180 and P280) were enhanced, suggesting that words were also acoustically better understood in a congruent body position. However, the difference in ERPs did not translate to differences on a behavioral level. Our results support the prediction of embodied processing of sleep- and activity-related words. Body position potentially induces a pre-activation of multimodal networks, thereby enhancing access to the semantic concepts of words related to current body position. The link between semantic meaning and body-related function could be a key element in explaining the influences of cognitive processing on sleep.","Hülsemann, Mareike J; Rasch, Björn",Psychophysiology,100,1

This study evaluated the first experiences with robotic-assisted laparoscopic DP (RA-LDP) and its rate of vessel preservation and SP compared to conventional laparoscopic DP (C-LDP). METHODS Patients scheduled for spleen-preserving DP for benign or borderline tumors by either C-LDP or RA-LDP were retrieved from a prospective database and retrospectively analyzed regarding vessel-preservation and SP, conversion rate, blood loss, operating time, complications, perioperative blood transfusion, postoperative hospital stay (PHS) and mortality. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients underwent C-LDP and 12 patients underwent RA-LDP between September 2009 and May 2015. SP rates were 79% (23 of 29) in the C-LDP and 92% (11 of 12) in the RA-LDP group (p = 0.32). Splenic vessels could be preserved in 17% (5 of 29) of the C-LDP and 50% (6 of 12) of the RA-LDP group (p = 0.052). Operating time, intraoperative blood loss, the number of perioperative red blood cell transfusions, overall morbidity and the rate of postoperative pancreatic fistulas were not different between the groups. PHS was shorter in the RA-LDP group (10.5 vs. 13 days; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION RA-LDP for benign or borderline tumors of the pancreas is a safe procedure and tended to be associated with a better vessel-preservation rate, thereby making it a good alternative to C-LDP.","Eckhardt, Sabine; Schicker, Christoph; Maurer, Elisabeth; Fendrich, Volker; Bartsch, Detlef K",Digestive surgery,100,1

This short 3-, 5- or 10-min test appraises an individual's sustained vigilant attention on a visual stimulus through reaction time, false starts and performance lapses. The PVT has been widely used as a measure to assess vigilant attention among shift workers, but information evaluating the application and performance of this test in different naturalistic shift work settings is limited. The purpose of this review is to synthesise and evaluate existing literature which has used the PVT to assess and monitor psychomotor performance in response to shift work schedules and rosters performed in real-world settings. METHODS A systematic search of studies examining PVT performance in response to 24/7 shift work schedules (e.g., day, afternoon, evening and night shifts) performed under naturalistic conditions was conducted. Articles were identified by searching Medline, Embase, CINHAL and PsycINFO databases in April 2020. RESULTS The search yielded 135 results, of which 16 publications were suitable to be included in this review. Articles were grouped according to when the PVT was applied to a research cohort, which included (a) multiple instances per shift, (b) commencement and cessation of shift and (c) other varying times. CONCLUSIONS This review suggests PVT performance is typically congruent across studies when the test is applied at generally consistent time intervals. The lack of research concerning the use of the PVT during extended duty shifts (e.g., shifts and on call work > 30 h) is an area for future research.","Ferris, Matthew; Bowles, Kelly-Ann; Bray, Mikaela; Bosley, Emma; Rajaratnam, Shantha M W; Wolkow, Alexander P",International archives of occupational and environmental health,100,1

There have been significant advances in their care over the last several decades, but the prospects for major advances within traditional treatment modalities appear limited. An artificial placenta using extracorporeal life support (ECLS) has been investigated in the laboratory as a new advance in the treatment of ELGANs. We review the concept of an artificial placenta, the purported benefits, and the most recent research efforts in this area. RECENT FINDINGS For 50 years, researchers have attempted to develop an artificial placenta based on ECLS. Traditional artificial placenta strategies have been based on arteriovenous ECLS using the umbilical vessels with moderate success. Recently, the use of venovenous ECLS and miniaturization of ECLS components have shown potential for creating a next-generation artificial placenta. SUMMARY ELGANs suffer the greatest morbidity and mortality of prematurity, and are poised to benefit from a paradigm shift in the treatment. Although challenges remain, the artificial placenta is feasible. An artificial placenta would not only protect ELGANs from the complications of mechanical ventilation, but also support their development until a stage of greater maturity, preparing them for a life free of the sequelae of prematurity.","Davis, Ryan P; Bryner, Benjamin; Mychaliska, George B",Current opinion in pediatrics,100,1

They can reduce operative time, parietal prejudice and postoperative pain. One of the most well-known complications of intraperitoneal mesh is seroma, but it usually subsides without any therapeutic problems. These meshes can be fixed by tackers, suture or glue. Few complications related to the fixation technique are known. We report the case of a patient who underwent a laparoscopic mesh repair for incisional hernia. He developed an infected bulky seroma for which he had to undergo medical treatment and percutanous drainage in order to avoid the mesh removal. The evolution seemed to be favorable until the occurrence of an unusual and unexpected complication: a digestive fistula of the small bowel in the seroma cavity via a tack adhering to the intestines. The possibility of digestive lesions by a tack is reported by some cases reports. It seems most often to be related to a technical problem. In our case, this adhesion seems to be secondary to the pressure exerted by the seroma. The complicated seroma can be conservatively treated to save the mesh. However the delay before deciding to remove the mesh when using tackers for its fixation may be shortened.","Elghali, Mohamed Amine; Nasri, Salsabil; Seghaier, Asma; Dhouioui, Khaireddine; Hamila, Fehmi; Youssef, Sabri; Letaief, Rached",International journal of surgery case reports,100,17

An extensive process of 11 rounds of internal and external review took place with exhaustive examination of each aspect of the terminology and classification. Decision-making was by collective opinion (consensus). RESULTS A terminology and classification of complications related directly to the insertion of prostheses and grafts in female pelvic floor surgery has been developed, with the classification based on category (C), time (T) and site (S) classes and divisions, that should encompass all conceivable scenarios for describing insertion complications and healing abnormalities.

Ten healthy men (19.5 ± 0.4 yr) completed two trials of progressive forearm isometric handgrip exercise to exhaustion (24.5 N increments every 3.5 min) in each of forearm above and below heart level [forearm arterial perfusion pressure (FAPP) difference of 29.5 ± 0.97 mmHg]. At the end of each EI, measurements of forearm blood flow (FBF; ml/min) via brachial artery Doppler and echo ultrasound, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP; mmHg) via finger photoplethysmography, and exercising forearm venous effluent via antecubital vein catheter revealed distinct cardiovascular response groups: n = 6 with compensatory vasodilation vs. n = 4 without compensatory vasodilation. Compensatory vasodilators were able to blunt the perfusion pressure-evoked reduction in submaximal O2D in the arm-above-heart condition, whereas nonvasodilators did not (-22.5 ± 13.6 vs. -65.4 ± 14.1 ml O2/min; P < 0.05), and in combination with being able to increase O2 extraction, nonvasodilators defended submaximal V̇o2 and experienced less of an accumulated submaximal O2D deficit (-80.7 ± 24.7 vs. -219.1 ± 36.0 ml O2/min; P < 0.05). As a result, the compensatory vasodilators experienced less of a compromise to peak EI than nonvasodilators (-24.5 ± 3.5 N vs. -52.1 ± 8.9 N; P < 0.05). In conclusion, in the forearm exercise model studied, vasodilatory response phenotypes exist that determine individual susceptibility to hypoperfusion and the degree to which aerobic metabolism and exercise performance are compromised.","Bentley, Robert F; Kellawan, J Mikhail; Moynes, Jackie S; Poitras, Veronica J; Walsh, Jeremy J; Tschakovsky, Michael E",Journal of applied physiology,100,16

In a cohort of 100 patients with cancer who were hospitalized for COVID-19, patients with hematologic cancer had higher mortality relative to patients with solid cancer. In two additional cohorts, flow cytometric and serologic analyses demonstrated that patients with solid cancer and patients without cancer had a similar immune phenotype during acute COVID-19, whereas patients with hematologic cancer had impairment of B cells and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibody responses. Despite the impaired humoral immunity and high mortality in patients with hematologic cancer who also have COVID-19, those with a greater number of CD8 T cells had improved survival, including those treated with anti-CD20 therapy. Furthermore, 77% of patients with hematologic cancer had detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses. Thus, CD8 T cells might influence recovery from COVID-19 when humoral immunity is deficient.

It is characterized by the infiltra tion of eosinophils in the pulmonary and alveolar interstitium, and may be primary or secondary as well as present an acute or chronic progress. OBJECTIVE to present 2 pediatric EP clinical cases which were diagnosed at the pediatric intensive care unit of Clinica Indisa in Santiago, Chile between 2014 and 2017. CLINICAL CASES Two older infants, who were hospitalized due to respiratory failure with a diagnosis of viral pneumonia. Both have asthmatic mothers. Additionally, they both had febrile syn drome, persistent condensation images in the chest x-rays, and peripheral eosinophilia throughout the course of the disease. One of the infants required oxygen for more than one month, and there was no eosinophilia in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In this case, the diagnosis of EP was reached via pulmonary biopsy. The other infant required mechanic ventilation for 28 days, and was diagnosed due to eosinophilia greater than 25% in the bronchoalveolar lavage. Both patients had excellent res ponse to systemic corticosteroids. CONCLUSION After ruling out other causes, EP should be suspected in children with pneumonia diagnosis, and persistent symptoms that do not respond positively to treatment, especially if associated with peripheral eosinophilia. The diagnosis of EP in pediatrics is confirmed with eosinophilia greater than 20% in BAL and, in some cases, it is necessary to perform a lung biopsy.","Linares P, Marcela; Monreal E, Victor; Gomez P, Paola; Martínez B, Pamela; Bozzo H, Rodrigo",Revista chilena de pediatria,100,31

In addition, several studies suggest that more vulnerable women are less likely to use them. Yet significant investments continue to be made in building and running MWHs within conflict-affected and under-resourced health systems. AIMS We critically examine the literature to shed light on the challenges and opportunities provided by MWHs during health emergencies and in conflict situations. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION MWHs are difficult to utilise during crises because they require women to be away from home, are often designed as dormitories, can lack security and be over-crowded. Some MWHs have been adapted during situations of political conflict to incorporate birthing and broader reproductive health care, thereby improving the availability of care away from over-burdened health facilities. How MWHs are adapted during times of crisis may provide insights into what systems of care are more appropriate in meeting women's needs more broadly. CONCLUSION The current global pandemic is an important time to reflect on whether MWHs are meeting the needs of a diverse range of women, in times of stability and during emergencies, and engage in genuine dialogue with women about the kinds of maternity care they want. We need to co-create those systems now so that they are more resilient during the inevitable crises we will face in the future.","Wild, Kayli; Kurji, Jaameeta",Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives,100,1

We provide population-level evidence on excess human incidence rates in Danish municipalities affected by disease outbreaks on mink farms and evaluate the effectiveness of two non-pharmaceutical interventions, i.e. culling of infected mink and local lockdowns. METHODS We use information on SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on mink farms in 94 Danish municipalities together with data on human SARS-CoV-2 cases and tested persons in weeks 24 to 51 of 2020. Difference-in-difference estimations and panel event studies for weekly human incidence rates are applied to 1) identify epidemiological trends of human SARS-CoV-2 infections associated disease outbreaks on mink farms, and 2) quantify the mitigating effects from the two non-pharmaceutical interventions. RESULTS SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on mink farms in a municipality associate with increase in weekly human incidence rates by about 75%; spatial spillover effects to neighbouring municipalities are also observed. Local lockdowns reduce human incidence rates, while culling of mink appears to be more effective in combination with a lockdown. The temporal lag between an outbreak on a mink farm and a significant increase in human incidence rates is estimated to be 1-3 weeks; lockdowns and culling of mink neutralizes this effect 4-8 weeks after the initial outbreak. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 infections among farmed mink in Denmark significantly link to local human infection trends. Strict animal and human disease surveillance in regions with mink farming should be pursued internationally to mitigate future epidemic developments.","Schmidt, Torben Dall; Mitze, Timo",European journal of public health,100,1

However, when using NPS RT-qPCR at busy airport quarantine stations, there are constraints on testing capacity, time, travelerstolerance, and availability of personal protective equipment for quarantine officers. A feasible alternative is therefore needed to test incoming travelers, especially when passenger numbers increase with the resumption of business, tourism, and economic activities. To explore alternatives to NPS RT-qPCR, we collected nasopharyngeal, anterior nasal, and saliva samples chronologically over days 1-7 from asymptomatic COVID-19 air travelers who were under quarantine at a designated facility, and we then compared test results for 9 different methods, comprising RT-qPCR (including the reference method), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and qualitative and quantitative antigen testing. We evaluated sensitivity for 97 person-day samples independently to evaluate asymptomatic travelers regardless of their testing date and period of asymptomatic status upon entry. Sensitivity of the different tests varied from 46.6% to 81.0%, but this was improved from 72.7% to 100.0% when the viral load was > 10 4 copies/sample on NPS RT-qPCR. Thus, most high-risk asymptomatic travelers with higher viral load would be detected by the tests evaluated.

Methods and Results: This study involved 1,018 de novo (balloon angioplasty, n=462; stent implantation, n=556) and 114 in-stent restenosis (ISR) FP lesions (balloon angioplasty, n=69; stent implantation, n=45) treated with endovascular therapy. For de novo FP lesions, the 3-year primary patency rate was significantly better with stent implantation than with balloon angioplasty (61% vs. 69%, log-rank P=0.001), but it was similar for ISR FP lesions (40% vs. 43%, log-rank P=0.83). For de novo FP lesions, stent implantation was favorable in all subgroups except for female sex (hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; 95% CI: 0.65-1.31, P=0.66), critical limb ischemia (CLI; HR, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.46-1.06, P=0.10), calcified lesion (HR, 0.81; 95% CI: 0.46-1.39, P=0.44), and poor tibial run-off (HR, 0.86; 95% CI: 0.59-1.25, P=0.42) subgroups. No difference was found between the 2 treatment strategies for ISR FP lesions in the majority of subgroups. Stent implantation, however, was favorable in totally occluded ISR FP lesions (HR, 0.45; 95% CI: 0.21-1.01, P=0.05). Conclusions: The primary patency rate in de novo FP lesions for the 2 treatment strategies was similar in the female, calcified lesion, CLI, and poor tibial run-off subgroups. Stent implantation was superior to balloon angioplasty for totally occluded ISR FP lesions.","Kobayashi, Norihiro; Hirano, Keisuke; Yamawaki, Masahiro; Araki, Motoharu; Sakai, Tsuyoshi; Obokata, Masaru; Sakamoto, Yasunari; Mori, Shinsuke; Tsutsumi, Masakazu; Nauchi, Masahiro; Honda, Yohsuke; Makino, Kenji; Shirai, Shigemitsu; Sugizaki, Yuta; Fukagawa, Tomoya; Kishida, Toshihiko; Ito, Yoshiaki",Circulation reports,100,27

Diagnosis and treatment of melioidosis can be challenging, and no licensed vaccines currently exist. Several studies have shown that this pathogen expresses a variety of structurally conserved protective antigens that include cell surface polysaccharides and cell-associated and cell-secreted proteins. Based on those findings, such antigens have become important components of the subunit vaccine candidates that we are currently developing. In the present study, the 6-deoxyheptan capsular polysaccharide (CPS) from B. pseudomallei was purified, chemically activated, and covalently linked to recombinant CRM197 diphtheria toxin mutant (CRM197) to produce CPS-CRM197. Additionally, tandem nickel-cobalt affinity chromatography was used to prepare highly purified recombinant B. pseudomallei Hcp1 and TssM proteins. Immunization of C57BL/6 mice with CPS-CRM197 produced high-titer IgG and opsonizing antibody responses against the CPS component of the glycoconjugate, while immunization with Hcp1 and TssM produced high-titer IgG and robust gamma interferon-secreting T cell responses against the proteins. Extending upon these studies, we found that when mice were vaccinated with a combination of CPS-CRM197 and Hcp1, 100% of the mice survived a lethal inhalational challenge with B. pseudomallei Remarkably, 70% of the survivors had no culturable bacteria in their lungs, livers, or spleens, indicating that the vaccine formulation had generated sterilizing immune responses. Collectively, these studies help to better establish surrogates of antigen-induced immunity against B. pseudomallei as well as provide valuable insights toward the development of a safe, affordable, and effective melioidosis vaccine.","Burtnick, Mary N; Shaffer, Teresa L; Ross, Brittany N; Muruato, Laura A; Sbrana, Elena; DeShazer, David; Torres, Alfredo G; Brett, Paul J",Infection and immunity,100,31

The former was the only available intervention when the current unprecedented Ebolavirus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa began. Prior to this, the development of EBOV vaccines and anti-viral therapies required time and resources that were not available. Therefore, focus has turned to re-purposing of existing, licenced medicines that may limit the morbidity and mortality rates of EBOV and could be used immediately. Here we test three such medicines and measure their ability to inhibit pseudotype viruses (PVs) of two EBOV species, Marburg virus (MARV) and avian influenza H5 (FLU-H5). We confirm the ability of chloroquine (CQ) to inhibit viral entry in a pH specific manner. The commonly used proton pump inhibitors, Omeprazole and Esomeprazole were also able to inhibit entry of all PVs tested but at higher drug concentrations than may be achieved in vivo. We propose CQ as a priority candidate to consider for treatment of EBOV.","Long, Jason; Wright, Edward; Molesti, Eleonora; Temperton, Nigel; Barclay, Wendy",F1000Research,100,1

Nephrolithiasis may indicate PHP with indication for parathyroidectomy. We sought to determine the proportion of patients with an index diagnosis of nephrolithiasis that have serum calcium levels measured, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels measured if hypercalcemic, and time to referral for definitive management if PHP is diagnosed. METHODS A single-institution retrospective review was performed of adult patients presenting with nephrolithiasis between July 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018. Exclusion criteria included currently admitted patients, prior nephrolithiasis, congenital or acquired urinary tract anomalies, and patients on calciuretics. Records were assessed for serum calcium and PTH measurement, as well as referrals. Univariate statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS Of 1782 patients with nephrolithiasis screened, 968 met inclusion criteria. Patients were 49.8% female, 88.9% white. Mean age was 53 y. Within this cohort, 620 (64.0%) patients had a calcium measured, with a mean elapsed time from presentation of 27 d (interquartile range [IQR] 0-8). Twelve patients (1.58%) with calcium measured were hypercalcemic and eight (66.7%) had PTH measured with a mean elapsed time from presentation of 183 d (IQR 72-310), all had elevated or non-suppressed PTH. Five (62.5%) were referred to surgeons with mean elapsed referral time of 270 d (IQR 95-492). CONCLUSIONS Many with index nephrolithiasis are not assessed for hypercalcemia or hyperparathyroidism. Patients with serum calcium and PTH values indicating PHP diagnosis may have significant delay to parathyroidectomy. Targeted interventions with electronic health record alerts or automated reflex testing may improve care in this domain.","Behrens, Matthew; Boyle, Shawna; Fingeret, Abbey L",The Journal of surgical research,100,31

Our aim was to investigate whether the severity of chest imaging findings among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) correlates with the risk of acute neuroimaging findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study included all patients with COVID-19 who received care at our hospital between March 3, 2020, and May 6, 2020, and underwent chest imaging within 10 days of neuroimaging. Chest radiographs were assessed using a previously validated automated neural network algorithm for COVID-19 (Pulmonary X-ray Severity score). Chest CTs were graded using a Chest CT Severity scoring system based on involvement of each lobe. Associations between chest imaging severity scores and acute neuroimaging findings were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS Twenty-four of 93 patients (26%) included in the study had positive acute neuroimaging findings, including intracranial hemorrhage (n = 7), infarction (n = 7), leukoencephalopathy (n = 6), or a combination of findings (n = 4). The average length of hospitalization, prevalence of intensive care unit admission, and proportion of patients requiring intubation were significantly greater in patients with acute neuroimaging findings than in patients without them (P < .05 for all). Compared with patients without acute neuroimaging findings, patients with acute neuroimaging findings had significantly higher mean Pulmonary X-ray Severity scores (5.0 [SD, 2.9] versus 9.2 [SD, 3.4], P < .001) and mean Chest CT Severity scores (9.0 [SD, 5.1] versus 12.1 [SD, 5.0], P = .041). The pulmonary x-ray severity score was a significant predictor of acute neuroimaging findings in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Patients with COVID-19 and acute neuroimaging findings had more severe findings on chest imaging on both radiographs and CT compared with patients with COVID-19 without acute neuroimaging findings. The severity of findings on chest radiography was a strong predictor of acute neuroimaging findings in patients with COVID-19.","Lang, M; Li, M D; Jiang, K Z; Yoon, B C; Mendoza, D P; Flores, E J; Rincon, S P; Mehan, W A; Conklin, J; Huang, S Y; Lang, A L; Giao, D M; Leslie-Mazwi, T M; Kalpathy-Cramer, J; Little, B P; Buch, K",AJNR.

While research has focused on the hyperinflammation, little research has been performed on the compensatory anti-inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory cytokine response to COVID-19, by assessing interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-10/lymphocyte count ratio and their association with outcomes. Methods Adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were recruited. The primary endpoint was maximum COVID-19 severity within 30 days of index ED visit. Results A total of 52 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. IL-10 and IL-10/lymphocyte count were significantly higher in patients with severe disease (p<0.05), as well as in those who developed severe acute kidney injury (AKI) and new positive bacterial cultures (all p≤0.01). In multivariable analysis, a one-unit increase in IL-10 and IL-10/lymphocyte count were associated with 42% (p=0.031) and 32% (p=0.013) increased odds, respectively, of severe COVID-19. When standardized to a one-unit standard deviations scale, an increase in the IL-10 was a stronger predictor of maximum 30-day severity and severe AKI than increases in IL-6 or IL-8. Conclusions The hyperinflammatory response to COVID-19 is accompanied by a simultaneous anti-inflammatory response, which is associated with poor outcomes and may increase the risk of new positive bacterial cultures. IL-10 and IL-10/lymphocyte count at ED presentation were independent predictors of COVID-19 severity. Moreover, elevated IL-10 was more strongly associated with outcomes than pro-inflammatory IL-6 or IL-8. The anti-inflammatory response in COVID-19 requires further investigation to enable more precise immunomodulatory therapy against SARS-CoV-2.","Henry, Brandon Michael; Benoit, Stefanie W; Vikse, Jens; Berger, Brandon A; Pulvino, Christina; Hoehn, Jonathan; Rose, James; Santos de Oliveira, Maria Helena; Lippi, Giuseppe; Benoit, Justin L",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,100,1

Published results obtained recently at this laboratory show that D. radiodurans submitted to ionizing radiation results in its DNA being shattered into small fragments which, when exposed to a ""static electric field' (SEF), greatly decreases cell viability. These findings motivated the performing of D. radiodurans exposed to gamma radiation, yet exposed to a different exogenous physical agent, ""static magnetic fields"" (SMF). Cells of D. radiodurans [strain D.r. GY 9613 (R1)] in the exponential phase were submitted to 60Co gamma radiation from a gamma cell. Samples were exposed to doses in the interval 0.5-12.5 kGy, while the control samples were kept next to the irradiation setup. Exposures to SMF were carried out with intensities of 0.08 T and 0.8 T delivered by two settings: (a) a device built up at this laboratory with niobium magnets, delivering 0.08 T, and (b) an electromagnet (Walker Scientific) generating static magnetic fields with intensities from 0.1 to 0.8 T. All samples were placed in a bacteriological incubator at 30 °C for 48 h, and after incubation, a counting of colony forming units was performed. Two sets of cell surviving data were measured, each in triplicate, obtained in independent experiments. A remarkable similarity between the two data sets is revealed, underscoring reproducibility within the 5% range. Appraisal of raw data shows that exposure of irradiated cells to SMF substantially increases their viability. Data interpretation strongly suggests that the increase of D. radiodurans cell viability is a sole magnetic physical effect, driven by a stochastic process, improving the efficiency of the rejoining of DNA fragments, thus increasing cell viability. A type of cut-off dose is identified at 10 kGy, above which the irradiated cellular system loses recovery and the cell survival mechanism collapses.","Righi, Henriette; Arruda-Neto, João D T; Gomez, José G C; da Silva, Luiziana F; Somessari, Elizabeth S R; Lemos, Aline C C",Journal of biological physics,100,1

The process typically occurs in patients with a history of chronic myeloproliferative disorders and may afflict the skin, lung, breast, gastrointestinal tract, breast, kidney, lymph node, and thyroid gland. In this article, we report the case of a 37-year-old female with more than 5 years history of acute B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia who presented with right upper quadrant pain and tenderness. Computed tomography scan showed multiple new ring-enhancing low-density lesions within the right and left hepatic lobes. A computed tomography-guided liver core biopsy was performed on one of the new liver lesions and showed extramedullary hematopoiesis with atypical megakaryocytes and sinusoidal capillarization with associated fibroblastic proliferation. Numerous atypical megakaryocytes were scattered in the background of haphazard collagen deposition. No significant blasts or a leukemic process were identified. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed extensive reticulin fibrosis (MF-3), trilineage dysplasia, increased blasts (10% to 19%), and hypercellularity (close to 100%), which was consistent with MDS-EB-2.

85940,85940,85940,Developing drugs for the 'undruggable'.,13.262862,5.7165604,2020-10-01,"A recently reported coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham implementation to compute nuclear shielding constants with gauge-including atomic orbitals and local hybrid functionals has been extended to cover higher derivatives of the density in the local mixing function (LMF) of the local hybrid as well as the calibration function (CF) needed to deal with the ambiguity of exchange-energy densities. This allowed the first evaluation of state-of-the-art local hybrids with ""calibrated"" exchange-energy densities for nuclear shieldings. Compared to previously evaluated simpler local hybrids without a CF, appreciable improvements are found for proton shieldings. Furthermore, the recent LH20t functional is still competitive with the outstanding performance of the uncalibrated LH12ct-SsirSVWN and LH12ct-SsifSVWN LHs for heavier nuclei, suggesting that LH20t is possibly the most robust choice of any rung-four functional for computing the nuclear shieldings of main-group nuclei so far. Interestingly, the presence of a CF in the functional significantly reduces the number of artifacts introduced by the widely used Maximoff-Scuseria framework to treat the local kinetic energy τ. The latter occurs in so-called t-LMFs used in many of the present local hybrids. In any case, the use of Dobson's current-density functional framework is also recommended with more advanced calibrated τ-dependent local hybrid functionals.","Schattenberg, Caspar Jonas; Kaupp, Martin",The journal of physical chemistry.

The basic principle is to do the maximum good for the most casualties with the least amount of resources. There are limited data to support the applicability of this principle in massive disasters such as the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, in which the number of patients seeking medical attention overwhelmed the local resources. OBJECTIVE To analyze the application of a triage system developed for use in a mass-casualty setting with limited resources. The system was designed to admit only those patients who had medical conditions requiring urgent treatment that were within the capabilities of the hospital and had a good chance of survival after discharge. Priority was given to those whose treatment could be administered within a short hospital stay. METHOD A retrospective, observational review of computerized registration forms of Haitian earthquake victims who sought medical care at a 72-bed field hospital within four to 14 days after the event. An analysis of the efficacy of the triage protocol that was used followed, using length of hospital stay to measure consumption of resources. RESULTS A total of 1,111 patients were triaged for treatment in the field hospital within 14 days of the earthquake. The median length of stay for all patients for whom data was available was 16 hours (mean = 29.7 hours). The majority of patients (n = 620, 65%) were discharged within 24 hours. Two hundred five patients underwent surgery and were discharged within a median of 39 hours (mean = 52.6 hours); of these, 124 (62%) were discharged within 48 hours. The total mortality of the treated patients was 1.5% (n = 17). CONCLUSIONS Currently accepted triage principles for the most part are appropriate for efficiently providing medical care in a disaster area with extremely limited resources, but require extensive adaptation to local conditions.","Merin, Ofer; Miskin, Ian N; Lin, Guy; Wiser, Itay; Kreiss, Yitshak",Prehospital and disaster medicine,100,22

This might not be true for bariatric surgery because of reimbursement requirements and changes in coding systems. We assessed the availability and validity of claims-based weight-related diagnosis codes among bariatric surgery patients. METHODS We identified three nested retrospective cohorts of adult bariatric surgery patients who underwent adjusted gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or sleeve gastrectomy between January 1, 2011 and June 30, 2018 using different components of OptumLabs® Data Warehouse, which contains linked de-identified claims and electronic health records (EHRs). We measured the availability of claims-based weight-related diagnosis codes in the 6-month preoperative and 1-year postoperative periods in the main cohort identified in the claims data. We created two claims-based algorithms to classify the presence of severe obesity (a commonly used cohort selection criterion) and categorize BMI (a commonly used baseline confounder or postoperative outcome). We evaluated their performance by estimating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and weighted kappa in two sub-cohorts using EHR-based BMI measurements as the reference. RESULTS Among the 29,357 eligible patients identified using claims only, 28,828 (98.2%) had preoperative weight-related diagnosis codes, either granular indicating BMI ranges or nonspecific denoting obesity status. Among the 27,407 patients with granular preoperative codes, 12,346 (45.0%) had granular codes and 9355 (34.1%) had nonspecific codes in the 1-year postoperative period. Among the 3045 patients with both preoperative claims-based diagnosis codes and EHR-based BMI measurements, the severe obesity classification algorithm had a sensitivity 100%, specificity 71%, positive predictive value 100%, and negative predictive value 78%. The BMI categorization algorithm had good validity categorizing the last available preoperative or postoperative BMI measurements (weighted kappa [95% confidence interval]: preoperative 0.78, [0.76, 0.79]; postoperative 0.84, [0.80, 0.87]). CONCLUSIONS Claims-based weight-related diagnosis codes had excellent validity before and after bariatric surgical operation but suboptimal availability after operation. Claims databases can be used for bariatric surgery studies of non-weight-related effectiveness and safety outcomes that are well-captured.","Li, Xiaojuan; Lewis, Kristina H; Callaway, Katherine; Wharam, J Frank; Toh, Sengwee",BMC medical research methodology,100,1

DESIGN AND METHOD Observational longitudinal study comparing 19 CAs and 83 VAs consecutively admitted to GHPU of Udine, Italy, and followed up for six months by MHS. Five psychometric scales assessed psychosocial and clinical characteristics for each patient at admission (T0), discharge (T1) and follow-up (T2). Statistical analyses were performed using: multivariate logistic regression for comparing CA and VA; Friedman χ2 and Mann-Whitney tests for outcomes' improvement. RESULTS Being hospitalised for a psychotic crisis was the most significant predictor of CA (OR = 5.07). An outcomes' improvement was observed from T0 to T1 in almost all psychometric tests, while from T1 to T2 only for PSP-A (useful social activities), CGI-S (severity of illness) and CGI-EI (drug's efficacy related to side effects). CA was associated to lower performances in all scales at T0, in GAF and CGI-S at T1, while no difference with VA was observed at T2. CONCLUSION CA and VA patients improved to a same extent during hospitalisation and follow-up, particularly in relation to social functioning. This fosters the hypothesis that community-based MHS using a longitudinal continuity of care model might achieve recovery in a long-term perspective. Future research may benefit by considering patients' subjective experiences and assessing long-term improvement in those who received person-centred interventions.","Castelpietra, Giulio; Guadagno, Silvia; Pischiutta, Livia; Tossut, Davide; Maso, Elisa; Albert, Umberto; Balestrieri, Matteo",Journal of public health research,100,1

The abnormal ICAT expression in mesangial cells under high glucose(HG) contributes to the development of diabetes and its complications such as diabetic nephropathy (DN). METHODS Human mesangial cells (HMCs) were cultured in either 5.5 (normal control) or 30 (high glucose) mmol/L glucose medium. Overexpression and knock-down of ICAT or β-catenin were carried out by transient transfection. PPARγ transcriptional activity was evaluated by luciferase assay. Protein-protein interactions were tested by Coimmunoprecipitation and GST-pull down assay. Cell phenotype transition of HMCs was detected by the expression level of α-SMA and fibronectin, as well as MTT assay. RESULTS High β-catenin protein expression but low ICAT was accompanied by low PPARγ transcriptional activity in HMCs cultured in HG. By using bioinformatics prediction, protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction experimental methods, ICAT and β-catenin were confirmed to act as coactivators in regulating PPARγ transcriptional activity. Overexpression of ICAT could mitigate the decrease of PPARγ transcriptional activity and partly relieve cell phenotype transition in HMCs. CONCLUSIONS β-catenin and ICAT interact as coactivator to modulate PPARγ transcriptional activation. In HMCs cultured in HG, the low expression of ICAT leads to low PPARγ transcriptional activation.","Wei, Yi; Yu, Jiawei; Zhang, Xiaopeng; Mu, Jiao; Zhang, Jun; Zeng, Wei; Feng, Bing","Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association",100,1

Methods By applying the K-means algorithm, 1,121 patients with NSCLC were divided into three categories. We evaluated the constructed signature in order to link it with the prognosis, which was constructed by univariate and least absolute shrinkage operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis. Results A total of three clusters were obtained by clustering five Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data sets. Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) and immune infiltration analysis were performed to explore the biological behavior. Cluster one presented an activated state of oncogenic pathways, and compared with the other two clusters, the median risk score was the highest, which was the reason for its poor survival. Cluster three showed that the immune pathway was active and the median risk score was the lowest, so the survival was the best. However, cluster two presented a state in which both immune and matrix pathways were activate. This was manifested as mutual antagonism, and its risk score was in the middle. Its survival was in the middle. Conclusions This work revealed the role of hypoxia related genes (HRGs) modification in tumor microenvironment, which was conducive to our comprehensive analysis of the prognosis of NSCLC, and provided direction and guidance for clinical immunotherapy.","Huang, Zhanghao; Wang, Shuo; Zhang, Hai-Jian; Zhou, You Lang; Tang, Xin; Shi, Jia-Hai",Translational lung cancer research,100,26

A randomized comparison of three instruments for hemorrhage control was performed [prototype endoscopic bipolar hemostasis forceps (BELA) vs. prototype endoscopic clip (E-CLIP) applier versus laparoscopic clip (L-CLIP) applier]. METHODS A hybrid transvaginal NOTES model in swine was used, with hemorrhage induced in either the gastroepiploic (GE) arteriovenous bundle (vessel diameter ~3 mm) or in distal mesenteric vessels (vessel diameter ~1-2 mm). Hemostasis was attempted three times per vessel using each instrument in a randomized order. Full laparoscopic salvage was performed if hemorrhage persisted beyond 10 min. Outcomes included primary success rate (PS), primary hemostasis time (PHT), number of device applications (DA), and overall hemostasis time (OHT, including salvage). RESULTS Seventy hemostasis attempts were made in 12 swine. PS was 42-67 % for the GE vessels, with no difference between instruments. PHT and OHT also were similar between instruments, with the BELA and L-CLIP having a higher number of DA. PS was (80-100 %) in mesenteric vessels, with the BELA and L-CLIP resulting in a shorter mean PHT compared with the E-CLIP. CONCLUSIONS All three instruments had similar effectiveness in achieving primary hemostasis during hybrid NOTES. Management of small vessel bleeding (1-2 mm) in a porcine model is effective using all three instruments but may be most efficient with the BELA or L-CLIP. Large vessel bleeding (≥3 mm) may be best managed by adding laparoscopic ports for assistance while maintaining a low threshold for conversion to full laparoscopy.","Santos, Byron F; Plachta, Stephen M; Soper, Nathaniel J; Hungness, Eric S",Surgical endoscopy,100,16

We report a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus RdRp mutant strain with a mutator phenotype. Based on structural data of RdRp, rational targeting of key residues, and screening of fidelity variants, we isolated a novel low-fidelity mutator strain of influenza virus that harbors a Tyr82-to-Cys (Y82C) single amino acid substitution in the PB1 polymerase subunit. The purified PB1-Y82C polymerase indeed showed an increased frequency of misincorporation compared with the wild-type PB1 in an in vitro biochemical assay. To further investigate the effects of position 82 on PB1 polymerase fidelity, we substituted various amino acids at this position. As a result, we isolated various novel mutators other than PB1-Y82C with higher mutation frequencies. The structural model of influenza virus polymerase complex suggested that the Tyr82 residue, which is located at the nucleoside triphosphate entrance tunnel, may influence a fidelity checkpoint. Interestingly, although the PB1-Y82C variant replicated with wild-type PB1-like kinetics in tissue culture, the 50% lethal dose of the PB1-Y82C mutant was 10 times lower than that of wild-type PB1 in embryonated chicken eggs. In conclusion, our data indicate that the Tyr82 residue of PB1 has a crucial role in regulating polymerase fidelity of influenza virus and is closely related to attenuated pathogenic phenotypes in vivo ImportanceInfluenza A virus rapidly acquires antigenic changes and antiviral drug resistance, which limit the effectiveness of vaccines and drug treatments, primarily owing to its high rate of evolution. Virus populations formed by quasispecies can contain resistance mutations even before a selective pressure is applied. To study the effects of the viral mutation spectrum and quasispecies, high- and low-fidelity variants have been isolated for several RNA viruses. Here, we report the discovery of a low-fidelity RdRp variant of influenza A virus that contains a substitution at Tyr82 in PB1. Viruses containing the PB1-Y82C substitution showed growth kinetics and viral RNA synthesis levels similar to those of the wild-type virus in cell culture; however, they had significantly attenuated phenotypes in a chicken egg infection experiment. These data demonstrated that a decreased RdRp fidelity attenuates influenza A virus in vivo, which is a desirable feature for the development of safer live-attenuated vaccine candidates.","Naito, Tadasuke; Shirai, Kazumasa; Mori, Kotaro; Muratsu, Hidetaka; Ushirogawa, Hiroshi; Ohniwa, Ryosuke L; Hanada, Kousuke; Saito, Mineki",Journal of virology,100,16

These viruses depend on cathepsin L for entry into their target cells. The viral glycoproteins need to be primed by protease cleavage, rendering them active for fusion with the host cell membrane. In this study, we developed a novel high-throughput screening assay based on peptides, derived from the glycoproteins of the aforementioned viruses, which contain the cathepsin L cleavage site. We screened a library of 5,000 small molecules and discovered a small molecule that can inhibit the cathepsin L cleavage of all viral peptides with minimal inhibition of cleavage of a host protein-derived peptide (pro-neuropeptide Y). The small molecule inhibited the entry of all pseudotyped viruses in vitro and the cleavage of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein in an in vitro cleavage assay. In addition, the Hendra and Nipah virus fusion glycoproteins were not cleaved in the presence of the small molecule in a cell-based cleavage assay. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the small molecule is a mixed inhibitor of cathepsin L. Our broad-spectrum antiviral small molecule appears to be an ideal candidate for future optimization and development into a potent antiviral against SARS-CoV and Ebola, Hendra, and Nipah viruses. IMPORTANCE We developed a novel high-throughput screening assay to identify small molecules that can prevent cathepsin L cleavage of viral glycoproteins derived from SARS-CoV and Ebola, Hendra, and Nipah viruses that are required for their entry into the host cell. We identified a novel broad-spectrum small molecule that could block cathepsin L-mediated cleavage and thus inhibit the entry of pseudotypes bearing the glycoprotein derived from SARS-CoV or Ebola, Hendra, or Nipah virus. The small molecule can be further optimized and developed into a potent broad-spectrum antiviral drug.","Elshabrawy, Hatem A; Fan, Jilao; Haddad, Christine S; Ratia, Kiira; Broder, Christopher C; Caffrey, Michael; Prabhakar, Bellur S",Journal of virology,100,24

The purpose of this study was to compare gap resistance and ultimate tensile strength of both suture materials and nonbarbed suture in a porcine ex vivo model. Methods: Porcine flexor tendons were harvested and divided into 3 groups of 10 of varying suture material (3-0 PDS™, 3-0 V- V-Loc 180™, or 3-0 Stratafix™). A modified 4-strand cruciate technique was used to repair each tendon. Knotless repair was performed using barbed suture, whereas a buried 6-throw square knot was done using conventional suture. A servohydrolic tester was used for biomechanical testing of linear 2-mm gap resistance and maximum tensile strength. Results: No difference was found in 2-mm gap resistance among the 3 groups. No difference was found in ultimate tensile strength between V-Loc™ (76.0 ± 9.4 N) and Stratafix™ (68.1 ± 8.4 N) repairs, but the ultimate strength of the PDS™ control group (83.4 ± 10.0 N) was significantly higher than that of Stratafix™. Conclusions: Barbed (knotless) and nonbarbed suture repairs demonstrate equivalent 2-mm gap resistance. Stratafix™ repairs show slightly inferior performance to nonbarbed repairs in ultimate tensile strength, although this occurred at gap distances far beyond the 2-mm threshold for normal tendon gliding. Both barbed and nonbarbed 4-strand cruciate flexor tendon repairs may require peripheral repair to withstand physiologic loads.","Sull, Alan; Inceoglu, Serkan; August, Alicia; Gregorius, Stephen; Wongworawat, Montri D",Hand,100,25

One of the PAMPs that binds to TLR2 and cluster of differentiation (CD) 14 is lipotechoic acid (LTA), which activates downstream signals culminating in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this study, we investigated whether in ovo LTA delivery leads to the induction of antiviral responses against post-hatch infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) infection. We first delivered the LTA into embryo day (ED)18 eggs via in ovo route so that the compound is available at the respiratory mucosa. Then the LTA treated and control ED18 eggs were allowed to hatch and the hatched chicken was infected with ILTV intratracheally on the day of hatch. We found that in ovo delivered LTA reduces ILTV infection post-hatch. We also found that in ovo delivery of LTA significantly increases mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in pre-hatch embryo lungs as well as mononuclear cell infiltration, predominantly macrophages, in lung of post-hatch chickens. Altogether, the data suggest that in ovo delivered LTA could be used to reduce ILTV infection in newly hatched chickens.","Thapa, S; Nagy, E; Abdul-Careem, M F",Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,100,16

Recurrent severe seizures begin in infancy and co-morbidities follow, including developmental delay, cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. A majority of DS patients have an SCN1A heterozygous gene mutation. This mutation causes a loss-of-function in inhibitory neurons, initiating seizure onset. We have investigated whether the sodium channelopathy may result in structural changes in the DS model independent of seizures. Morphometric analyses of axons within the corpus callosum were completed at P16 and P50 in Scn1a heterozygote KO male mice and their age-matched wild-type littermates. Trainable machine learning algorithms were used to examine electron microscopy images of ∼400 myelinated axons per animal, per genotype, including myelinated axon cross-section area, frequency distribution and g-ratios. Pilot data for Scn1a heterozygote KO mice demonstrate the average axon caliber was reduced in developing and adult mice. Qualitative analysis also shows micro-features marking altered myelination at P16 in the DS model, with myelin out-folding and myelin debris within phagocytic cells. The data has indicated, in the absence of behavioral seizures, factors that governed a shift toward small calibre axons at P16 have persisted in adult Scn1a heterozygote KO corpus callosum. The pilot study provides a basis for future meta-analysis that will enable robust estimates of the effects of the sodium channelopathy on axon architecture. We propose that early therapeutic strategies in DS could help minimize the effect of sodium channelopathies, beyond the impact of overt seizures, and therefore achieve better long-term treatment outcomes.","Richards, Kay; Jancovski, Nikola; Hanssen, Eric; Connelly, Alan; Petrou, Steve",Brain research,100,5

METHODS From 2002 to 2012, 295 tumors (162 HCCs and 133 metastases; mean diameter 1.3 ± 0.6 cm, range 0.5-2.5 cm) detectable on contrast-enhanced CT/MRI, but completely undetectable with unenhanced US and either totally undetectable or incompletely conspicuous with contrast-enhanced US (CEUS), were treated in 215 sessions using either internally cooled radiofrequency or microwave with standard ablation protocols, guided by an image fusion system (Virtual Navigation System, Esaote S.p.A., Genova, Italy) that combines US with CT/ MRI images. Correct targeting and successful ablation of tumor were verified after 24 hours with CT or MRI. RESULTS A total of 282 of 295 (95.6 %) tumors were correctly targeted with successful ablation achieved in 266 of 295 (90.2 %). Sixteen of 295 (5.4 %) tumors were correctly targeted, but unsuccessfully ablated, and 13 of 295 (4.4 %) tumors were unsuccessfully ablated due to inaccurate targeting. There were no perioperative deaths. Major complications were observed in 2 of the 215 treatments sessions (0.9 %). CONCLUSIONS Real-time virtual navigation system with US-CT/MRI fusion imaging is precise for targeting and achieving successful ablation of target tumors undetectable with US alone. Therefore, a larger population could benefit from ultrasound guided ablation procedures.","Mauri, Giovanni; Cova, Luca; De Beni, Stefano; Ierace, Tiziana; Tondolo, Tania; Cerri, Anna; Goldberg, S Nahum; Solbiati, Luigi",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,100,16

In a recognition and detection process, the hybridization of MBs with target DNA sequences restores the strong photoluminescence, which is quenched before hybridization. Making better MBs involves reducing the background photoluminescence and increasing the brightness of the PLS, which therefore involves the development of new PLS and quenchers, as well as innovative PLS-quencher systems. Heavy-metal complexes, nanocrystals, pyrene compounds, and other materials with excellent photophysical properties have been applied as PLS of MBs. Nanoparticles, nanowires, graphene, metal films, and many other media have also been introduced to quench photoluminescence. On the basis of their high specificity, selectivity, and sensitivity, MBs are developed as a general platform for sensing, producing, and carrying molecules other than oligonucleotides.","Huang, Kewei; Martí, Angel A",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,100,9

The aim was to assess the effectiveness and safety of magnesium supplementation for older adults with insomnia. METHODS A search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine, clinicaltrials.gov and two grey literature databases comparing magnesium supplementation to placebo or no treatment. Outcomes were sleep quality, quantity, and adverse events. Risk of bias and quality of evidence assessments were carried out using the RoB 2.0 and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approaches. Data was pooled and treatment effects were quantified using mean differences. For remaining outcomes, a modified effects direction plot was used for data synthesis. RESULTS Three randomized control trials (RCT) were identified comparing oral magnesium to placebo in 151 older adults in three countries. Pooled analysis showed that post-intervention sleep onset latency time was 17.36 min less after magnesium supplementation compared to placebo (95% CI - 27.27 to - 7.44, p = 0.0006). Total sleep time improved by 16.06 min in the magnesium supplementation group but was statistically insignificant. All trials were at moderate-to-high risk of bias and outcomes were supported by low to very low quality of evidence. CONCLUSION This review confirms that the quality of literature is substandard for physicians to make well-informed recommendations on usage of oral magnesium for older adults with insomnia. However, given that oral magnesium is very cheap and widely available, RCT evidence may support oral magnesium supplements (less than 1 g quantities given up to three times a day) for insomnia symptoms.","Mah, Jasmine; Pitre, Tyler",BMC complementary medicine and therapies,100,19

TGA and elemental analysis indicate that the water content of the incubated PVPON-PAA film is only ∼4%. FT-IR proved that at high temperature these water molecules can be easily driven out of the film. When the incubated film was characterized with a spectrometer, it exhibited Fabry-Pérot fringes in the UV-visible-NIR spectrum. Such Fabry-Pérot fringes, sensitive to the change of water content in the film, were applied to study drying, drying-rewetting cycle, and humidity-responsive behavior of the film. The film exhibited reversible swelling-deswelling behavior during the incubation-heating cycles. The film thickness was found to decrease ∼10% upon drying. When the dry film was exposed to different humidity environments, it was found that the optical thickness of the film has a linear relationship with ambient humidity.","Yang, Shuguang; Zhang, Yongjun; Guan, Ying; Tan, Shuaixia; Xu, Jian; Cheng, Shijing; Zhang, Xiaoli",Soft matter,100,16

The purpose of this study was to compare the influence of non-cross-linked human dermis (AlloDerm) with that of cross-linked porcine dermis (Permacol) on the expression of genes critical for wound healing and tissue remodeling in a rat ventral hernia model. METHODS Full-thickness abdominal wall defects were repaired with AlloDerm, Permacol, or suture repair with no mesh (n = 10 rats per group). Explants were harvested 90 days after repair and divided for histologic, immunohistochemical, and gene expression analyses. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction arrays were used to profile the expression of 84 wound healing-associated genes at the tissue/mesh interface. RESULTS Both meshes induced the differential expression (≥ 3-fold change relative to suture repair, p ≤ 0.01) of extracellular matrix components, remodeling enzymes, and inflammatory cytokines. Genes most markedly up-regulated included matrix metalloproteinase-9 (Permacol, 66-fold; AlloDerm, 19-fold) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 12 (Permacol, 24-fold; AlloDerm, 71-fold). Immunohistochemistry using antibodies against matrix metalloproteinase-9 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 12 confirmed differential expression at the protein level (p < 0.001). Histologically, AlloDerm demonstrated overall better remodeling characteristics than Permacol. CONCLUSIONS Permacol elicits increased protease expression and reduced cellular and vascular infiltration compared with AlloDerm 90 days after implantation, indicative of delayed remodeling induced by cross-linking. Increased understanding of the host response to implanted materials ultimately will enable the development of improved meshes with enhanced wound healing properties and fewer graft-related complications.","Carlson, Terri L; Lee, Karen W; Pierce, Lisa M",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,100,1

We reviewed hospital visitor restriction policies for consistency and to develop recommendations to highlight fair and transparent restrictions, exceptions, and appeals in policy development and implementation. DESIGN Collection and analysis of public-facing visitor restriction policies during the first 3 months of the pandemic. SETTING General acute care hospitals representing 23 states across all 4 major regions of the United States. PARTICIPANTS A cohort of the 70 largest hospitals by total bed capacity. MEASUREMENTS Characteristics of visitor restriction policies including general visitor restriction statement, changes/updates to policies over time, exceptions to policies, and restrictions specific to COVID-19-positive patients. RESULTS Sixty-five of the 70 hospitals reviewed had public-facing visitor restriction policies. Forty-nine of these 65 policies had general ""no-visitor"" statements, whereas 16 allowed at least 1 visitor to accompany all patients. Sixty-three of 65 hospitals included exceptions to their visitor restriction policies. Setting-specific exceptions included pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, emergency department, behavioral health, inpatient rehabilitation, surgery, and outpatient clinics. Exceptions that applied across settings included patients at end of life and patients with disabilities. CONCLUSION Visitor restriction policies varied significantly among hospitals in this review. These variances create challenges in that their fair application may be problematic and ethical issues related to allocation may arise. Five recommendations are offered for hospitals revising or creating such policies, including that offering transparent, accessible, public-facing policies can minimize ethical dilemmas. In addition, hospitals would benefit from communicating with each other in the development of visitor policies to ensure uniformity and support patients and family members as they navigate hospital visitation.","Jaswaney, Rohit; Davis, Arlene; Cadigan, R Jean; Waltz, Margaret; Brassfield, Elizabeth R; Forcier, Bex; Joyner, Benny L",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,100,16

We sought to characterize these handover practices to identify areas of improvement and determine if handover standardization might be beneficial for trauma team performance. METHODS Data were prospectively collected over a nine-week period by a trained observer at a Canadian level one trauma centre. A randomized scheduled was used to capture a representative breadth of handovers. Data collected included outcome measures such as duration of handover, structure of the handover, and information shared, process measures such as questions and interruptions from the trauma team, and perceptions of the handover from nurses, trauma team leaders and EMS according to a bidirectional Likert scale. RESULTS 79 formal verbal handovers were observed. Information was often missing regarding airway (present 22%), breathing (54%), medications (59%), and allergies (54%). Handover structure lacked consistency beyond the order of identification and mechanism of injury. Of all questions asked, 35% were questioning previously given information. The majority of handovers (61%) involved parallel conversations between team members while EMS was speaking. There was a statistically significant disparity between the self-evaluation of EMS handovers and the perceived quality determined by nurses and trauma team leaders. CONCLUSIONS We have identified the need to standardize handover due to poor information content, a lack of structure and active listening, information repetition, and discordant expectations between team members.

To date, no fixation technique has been proven superior in a clinical setting. The purpose of the study was to systematically review the available literature on approach and fixation methods for distal biceps tendon repair in a clinical setting and to determine the optimal fixation methods of the distal biceps tendon on the radial tuberosity. Our hypothesis was that the outcomes would not be significantly different among the various fixation techniques and approaches. METHODS A systematic review of the available literature on anatomic reconstruction methods for distal biceps tendon ruptures was performed. The outcome measures evaluated were postoperative range of motion, elbow flexion and supination strength, and complication rates and types. RESULTS Forty articles were included, representing 1074 patients divided into 4 fixation groups: suture anchors, bone tunnels, interference screws, and cortical buttons. There was no significant difference in range of motion and strength between the different approaches and fixation techniques. Complications were significantly less common after the double-incision approach with bone tunnel fixation (P < .0005). CONCLUSIONS There were significantly fewer complications after the double-incision approach with bone tunnel fixation. The double-incision approach had significantly fewer complications than the single-incision anterior approach, and the bone tunnel fixation had significantly fewer complications than the other 3 fixation techniques. However, as the double-incision approach was used with bone tunnel fixation in 84% of cases, there was a strong interrelationship between these variables.","Kodde, Izaäk F; Baerveldt, Remco C; Mulder, Paul G H; Eygendaal, Denise; van den Bekerom, Michel P J",Journal of shoulder and elbow surgery,100,30

The new species share similarities with the two previously emerged entities: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) that have caused outbreaks in 2002 and 2012, respectively. Interestingly, all of these coronaviruses can cause potentially fatal respiratory syndromes, though behave differently in patients with cancer compared to patients without cancer. Accordingly, the present chapter aims to, through a systematic investigation, estimate the prevalence of cancer among COVID-19, SARS, and MERS confirmed cases. Our analysis based on data from 78 studies with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 confirmed cases showed that the prevalence of cancer (4.94%) stands at fourth place after hypertension (20.8%), diabetes (11.39%), and cardiovascular diseases (7.46%). According to the findings of the present study, comorbidities are significantly more common in patients with MERS compared to patients with COVID-19 and SARS, and this was the cancer case as well. Further studies need to address whether or not patients with coronaviruses and cancer are different from patients with coronaviruses without cancer in terms of clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, outcomes, and men to women ratio.","Fotouhi, Maryam; Samami, Elham; Mohseni, Sahar; Nasrollahizadeh, Amir; Haddadi, Mohammad; Mirbeyk, Mona; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,100,5

A specific diagnosis was not reached in 2/38 (5.26%) patients after video-assisted thoracic surgery. CONCLUSION Video-assisted thoracic surgery is a highly effective and safe method for establishing a specific diagnosis in patients with interstitial lung disease.","Bagheri, Reza; Haghi, Seyed Ziaollah; Attaran, Davood; Hashem Asnaashari, Amir Mohammad; Basiri, Reza; Rajabnejad, Ata'ollah",Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals,100,12

The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for vaginal mesh erosion after SCP in Korean women. METHODS This retrospective cohort study included 363 women who underwent SCP with type 1 polypropylene mesh. They were evaluated at 1, 4, and 12 months after surgery and then annually thereafter with respect to anatomy and complications. Univariate and multivariate analyses using the Cox proportional hazard model were performed to identify the risk factors for mesh erosion. RESULTS During the median 2-year follow-up period, vaginal mesh erosion was found in 29 women (8.0%). Among them, 19 (65.5%) required surgical correction. Estrogenic status was the only independent risk factor for mesh erosion. The risk for mesh erosion was 4.5 times higher in premenopausal women than in menopausal women not on estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) (95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.9-10.9, p<0.01). Menopausal women on ERT also had an increased risk, with a statistically marginal significance (hazard ratio 2.5, 95% CI 0.9-6.6; p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS Premenopausal or menopausal women on ERT are at high risk for mesh erosion after SCP with type 1 polypropylene mesh, and two-thirds of mesh erosion cases require reoperation. This information should be incorporated into patient counseling and treatment decisions.","Kim, Tae Yeon; Jeon, Myung Jae",PloS one,100,24

Brauner et al. [2] (n=41), along with others, present contradictory results with bigger samples that are not discussed in the manuscript. The authors do not present adequate reasoning for such a small pool of data and exclude numerous countries that provide similarly appropriate data (e.g., Switzerland by canton). Given the small sample size, the study is also at a very high risk of uncontrolled confounding. For instance, Sweden and Iran are directly compared in terms of the outcomes of their interventions without considering the plethora of cultural, social, and political differences between them that might impact their case count. This is worrisome, because there are examples of other, more culturally similar, nations which could have been included in either group, such as Denmark for which case counts by administrative region are publicly available online. We therefore argue that the potential for unmeasured confounding could have been reduced with a larger and more careful composition of the sample and should be directly acknowledged.","Besançon, Lonni; Meyerowitz-Katz, Gideon; Flahault, Antoine",European journal of clinical investigation,100,1

Limited availability of animal models severely impacts the study of cell type specific contributions to disease. Moreover, animal models usually do not reflect variability in mutations and disease courses seen in human patients. Reprogramming methods for generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have revolutionized patient specific research and created valuable tools for studying disease mechanisms. However, iPSC technology has disadvantages such as time, labor commitment, clonal selectivity and loss of epigenetic markers. Recent modifications of these methods allow more direct generation of cell lineages or specific cell types, bypassing clonal isolation or a pluripotent stem cell state. We have developed a rapid direct conversion method to generate induced Neuronal Progenitor Cells (iNPCs) from skin fibroblasts utilizing retroviral vectors in combination with neuralizing media. The iNPCs can be differentiated into neurons (iNs) oligodendrocytes (iOs) and astrocytes (iAs). iAs production facilitates rapid drug and disease mechanism testing as differentiation from iNPCs only takes 5 days. Moreover, iAs are easy to work with and are generated in pure populations at large numbers. We developed a highly reproducible co-culture assay using mouse GFP+ neurons and patient derived iAs to evaluate potential therapeutic strategies for numerous neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Importantly, the iA assays are scalable to 384-well format facilitating the evaluation of multiple small molecules in one plate. This approach allows simultaneous therapeutic evaluation of multiple patient cell lines with diverse genetic background. Easy production and storage of iAs and capacity to screen multiple compounds in one assay renders this methodology adaptable for personalized medicine.","Dennys, Cassandra N; Sierra-Delgado, Julieth A; Ray, Shrestha Sinha; Hartlaub, Annalisa M; Roussel, Florence S; Rodriguez, Yacidzohara; Meyer, Kathrin",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,100,7

Viruses induce type I IFNs that initiate signaling to the OAS genes. OAS proteins are pathogen recognition receptors for the viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern, double-stranded RNA. Double-stranded RNA activates OAS to produce p(x)5'A(2'p5'A)(n); x = 1-3; n > 2 (2-5A) from ATP. Upon binding 2-5A, RNase L is converted from an inactive monomer to a potently active dimeric endoribonuclease for single-stranded RNA. RNase L contains, from N- to C-terminus, a series of 9 ankyrin repeats, a linker, several protein kinase-like motifs, and a ribonuclease domain homologous to Ire1 (involved in the unfolded protein response). In the past few years, it has become increasingly apparent that RNase L and OAS contribute to innate immunity in many ways. For example, small RNA cleavage products produced by RNase L during viral infections can signal to the retinoic acid-inducible-I like receptors to amplify and perpetuate signaling to the IFN-β gene. In addition, RNase L is now implicated in protecting the central nervous system against viral-induced demyelination. A role in tumor suppression was inferred by mapping of the RNase L gene to the hereditary prostate cancer 1 (HPC1) gene, which in turn led to discovery of the xenotropic murine leukemia-related virus. A broader role in innate immunity is suggested by involvement of RNase L in cytokine induction and endosomal pathways that suppress bacterial infections. These newly described findings about RNase L could eventually provide the basis for developing broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs.","Chakrabarti, Arindam; Jha, Babal Kant; Silverman, Robert H",Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,100,8

Cardiac iron dysregulation has been recently implicated in cardiomyopathy. Here we investigated the protective effects of caloric restriction on cardiac remodeling in impaired leptin signaling obese mice. RNA-seq analysis was performed to assess the differential gene expressions in the heart of wild-type and ob/ob mice. In particular, to investigate the roles of caloric restriction on iron homeostasis-related gene expressions, 10-week-old ob/ob and db/db mice were assigned to ad libitum or calorie-restricted diets for 12 weeks. Male ob/ob mice exhibited LVH, cardiac inflammation, and oxidative stress. Using RNA-seq analysis, we identified that an iron uptake-associated gene, transferrin receptor, was upregulated in obese ob/ob mice with LVH. Caloric restriction attenuated myocyte hypertrophy, cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress in ob/ob and db/db mice. Furthermore, we found that caloric restriction reversed iron homeostasis-related lipocalin 2, divalent metal transporter 1, transferrin receptor, ferritin, ferroportin, and hepcidin expressions in the heart of ob/ob and db/db mice. These findings demonstrate that the cardioprotective effects of caloric restriction result from the cellular regulation of iron homeostasis, thereby decreasing oxidative stress, inflammation, and cardiac remodeling. We suggest that decreasing iron-mediated oxidative stress and inflammation offers new therapeutic approaches for obesity-induced cardiomyopathy.","An, Hyeong Seok; Lee, Jong Youl; Choi, Eun Bee; Jeong, Eun Ae; Shin, Hyun Joo; Kim, Kyung Eun; Park, Kyung-Ah; Jin, Zhen; Lee, Jung Eun; Koh, Jin Sin; Kwak, Woori; Kim, Won-Ho; Roh, Gu Seob",Scientific reports,100,8

Multiple and complex factors are contributing to the increase, including non-clinical factors related to individual women, families and their interactions with health providers. This global qualitative evidence synthesis explores women's preferences for mode of birth and factors underlying preferences for CS. METHODS Systematic database searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO) were conducted in December 2016 and updated in May 2019 and February 2021. Studies conducted across all resource settings were eligible for inclusion, except those from China and Taiwan which have been reported in a companion publication. Phenomena of interest were opinions, views and perspectives of women regarding preferences for mode of birth, attributes of CS, societal and cultural beliefs about modes of birth, and right to choose mode of birth. Thematic synthesis of data was conducted. Confidence in findings was assessed using GRADE-CERQual. RESULTS We included 52 studies, from 28 countries, encompassing the views and perspectives of pregnant women, non-pregnant women, women with previous CS, postpartum women, and women's partners. Most of the studies were conducted in high-income countries and published between 2011 and 2021. Factors underlying women preferences for CS had to do mainly with strong fear of pain and injuries to the mother and child during labour or birth (High confidence), uncertainty regarding vaginal birth (High confidence), and positive views or perceived advantages of CS (High confidence). Women who preferred CS expressed resoluteness about it, but there were also many women who had a clear preference for vaginal birth and those who even developed strategies to keep their birth plans in environments that were not supportive of vaginal births (High confidence). The findings also identified that social, cultural and personal factors as well as attributes related to health systems impact on the reasons underlying women preferences for various modes of birth (High confidence). CONCLUSIONS A wide variety of factors underlie women's preferences for CS in the absence of medical indications. Major factors contributing to perceptions of CS as preferable include fear of pain, uncertainty with vaginal birth and positive views on CS. Interventions need to address these factors to reduce unnecessary CS.","Colomar, Mercedes; Opiyo, Newton; Kingdon, Carol; Long, Qian; Nion, Soledad; Bohren, Meghan A; Betran, Ana Pilar",PloS one,100,31

In addition to sleep fragmentation, women undergo a complex set of physiological and environmental changes upon entering the postpartum period, confounding our understanding of effects of postpartum sleep disturbance. The primary study aim was to understand the basic impact of a single night of postpartum-like sleep fragmentation on sleep architecture, nocturnal melatonin levels, mood, daytime sleepiness, and neurobehavioral performance. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS For one week prior to entry into the laboratory, eleven healthy nulliparous women kept a stable sleep-wake schedule (verified via actigraphy). Participants contributed three consecutive nights of laboratory overnight polysomnography: (1) a habituation/sleep disorder screening night; (2) a baseline night; and (3) a sleep fragmentation night, when participants were awakened three times for ~30min each. Self-reported sleep quality and mood (Profile of Mood States survey) both decreased significantly after sleep fragmentation compared to baseline measurements. Unexpectedly, daytime sleepiness (Multiple Sleep Latency Test) decreased significantly after sleep fragmentation. Experimental fragmentation had no significant effect on time spent in nocturnal sleep stages, urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin concentration, or psychomotor vigilance test performance. Participants continued to provide actigraphy data, and daily PVTs and self-reported sleep quality assessments at home for one week following sleep fragmentation; these assessments did not differ from baseline values. CONCLUSIONS While there were no changes in measured physiological components of a single night of postpartum-like experimental sleep fragmentation, there were decreases in self-reported measures of mood and sleep quality. Future research should examine the effects of multiple nights of modeling postpartum-like sleep fragmentation on objective measures of sleep and daytime functioning.","McBean, Amanda L; Kinsey, Steven G; Montgomery-Downs, Hawley E",Physiology & behavior,100,0

We compared the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 'usual' (5 mg every 4 weeks) versus 'fast' (5 mg every 2 weeks) escalation of oral MTX. METHODS This multicentre, open-label (assessor blinded) RCT included patients 18-55 years of age having active RA with disease duration <5 years, and not on DMARDs. Patients were randomized 1:1 into usual or fast escalation groups, both groups starting MTX at 15 mg/week till a maximum of 25 mg/week. Primary outcome was EULAR good response at 16 weeks, secondary outcomes were ΔDAS28 and adverse effects (AE). Analyses were intention-to-treat. RESULTS 178 patients with mean DAS28-CRP of 5.4(1.1) were randomized to usual (n=89) or fast escalation groups (n=89). At 16 weeks, there was no difference in good EULAR response in the usual (28.1%) or fast escalation (22.5%) groups (p=0.8). There was no difference in mean ΔDAS28-CRP at 8 weeks (-0.9, -0.8, p=0.72) or 16 weeks (-1.3, -1.3, p=0.98). Even at 24 weeks (extended follow-up), responses were similar. There were no inter-group differences in ΔHAQ, or MTX-polyglutamates 1-3 levels at 8 or 16 weeks. Gastrointestinal AE were higher in the fast escalation group over initial 8 weeks (27%, 40%, p=0.048), but not over 16 weeks. There was no difference in cytopenias, transaminitis, or drug discontinuation/dose reduction between the groups. No serious AE were seen. CONCLUSION A faster MTX escalation strategy in RA was not more efficacious over 16-24 weeks, and did not significantly increase AE, except higher gastrointestinal AE initially.

Using the International Retrospective Study of the Pipeline Embolization Device (IntrePED) registry, the authors assessed the age-related clinical outcomes of patients undergoing aneurysm embolization with the PED. METHODS Patients with unruptured aneurysms in the IntrePED registry were divided into 4 age groups: ≤ 50, 51-60, 61-70, and > 70 years old. The rates of the following postoperative complications were compared between age groups using chi-square tests: spontaneous rupture, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), ischemic stroke, parent artery stenosis, cranial neuropathy, neurological morbidity, neurological mortality, combined neurological morbidity and mortality, and all-cause mortality. The association between age and these complications was tested in a multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for sex, number of PEDs, and aneurysm size, location, and type. RESULTS Seven hundred eleven patients with 820 unruptured aneurysms were included in this study. Univariate analysis demonstrated no significant difference in ICH rates across age groups (lowest 1.0% for patients ≤ 50 years old and highest 5.0% for patients > 70 years old, p = 0.097). There was no difference in ischemic stroke rates (lowest 3.6% for patients ≤ 50 years old and highest 6.0% for patients 50-60 years old, p = 0.73). Age > 70 years old was associated with higher rates of neurological mortality; patients > 70 years old had neurological mortality rates of 7.4% compared with 3.3% for patients 61-70 years old, 2.7% for patients 51-60 years old, and 0.5% for patients ≤ 50 years old (p = 0.006). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, increasing age was associated with higher odds of combined neurological morbidity and mortality (odds ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.05; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Increasing age is associated with higher neurological morbidity and mortality after Pipeline embolization of intracranial aneurysms. However, the overall complication rates of PED treatment in this group of highly selected elderly patients (> 70 years) were acceptably low, suggesting that age alone should not be considered an exclusion criterion when considering treatment of intracranial aneurysms with the PED.","Brinjikji, Waleed; Kallmes, David F; Cloft, Harry J; Lanzino, Giuseppe",Journal of neurosurgery,100,24

Furthermore, platinum coils cause strong beam-hardening artifacts, hampering subsequent image analyses. OBJECTIVE To assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of flow-diverting, stent-assisted microsphere embolization of fusiform and sidewall aneurysms in vitro and in vivo. METHODS Using a recirculating pulsatile in vitro flow model, 5 different aneurysm geometries (inner/outer curve, narrow/wide neck, and fusiform) were treated (each n = 1) by flow-diverting stent (FDS) implantation and subsequent embolization through a jailed microcatheter using calibrated microspheres (500-900 μm) larger than the pores of the FDS mesh. Treatment effects were analyzed angiographically and by micro computed tomography. The fluid of the in vitro model was filtered to ensure that no microspheres evaded the aneurysm. The experiment was repeated once in vivo. RESULTS In vitro, all 5 aneurysms were safely and completely occluded by FDS-assisted microsphere embolization. Virtually complete aneurysm occlusion was confirmed by angiography and micro computed tomography. No microspheres escaped into the circulation. The experiment was successfully repeated in 1 pig with a sidewall aneurysm generated by vessel occlusion. An embolic protection system placed distally of the FDS in vitro and in vivo (each n = 1) contained no microspheres after the embolization. Thus, no microspheres were lost in the circulation, and the use of an embolic protection system seems feasible to provide additional safety. CONCLUSION FDS-assisted microsphere embolization of fusiform and sidewall aneurysms is feasible and yields virtually complete aneurysm occlusion while avoiding coil-associated beam-hardening artifacts.","Nonn, Andrea; Kirschner, Stefanie; Figueiredo, Giovanna; Kramer, Martin; Nikoubashman, Omid; Pjontek, Rastislav; Wiesmann, Martin; Brockmann, Marc A",Neurosurgery,100,1

The potential bias of the studies was assessed by Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal Tool. Results Of 1,067 papers found, 24 cross-sectional studies with a total of 35,967 participants were included in this review. The general public lacked good knowledge of SARS and MERS at the early stage of epidemics. Some people's knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of COVID-19 had been improved, but the health behaviors of some special groups including children and their parents need to be strengthened. Negative emotions including fear and stigmatization occurred during the outbreaks. Reliable health information was needed to improve public awareness and mental health for infectious diseases. Health information from nonprofit, government and academic websites was more accurate than privately owned commercial websites and media websites.

METHODS Between November 2016 and June 2019, 23 consecutive gastric cancer patients, who underwent curative LPG with lymphadenectomy, were enrolled in the study. In this study, we devised a simple hand-sewn technique for esophagogastrostomy, which comprises a 5-cm pseudo-fornix as a fundoplication, the posterior pressure mechanism by the remnant stomach and bilateral crus, and a flat-shaped anastomotic hole as a valvuloplasty. RESULTS The median operation time and hospital stay was 325 min and 10 days, respectively. There was no patient with anastomotic leakage and delayed gastric empting. No patient had symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, but two patients (8.6% (2/23): Grade M and Grade A) had endoscopic findings during a follow-up period of more than 6 months. There was no patient with Grade B or more severe reflux esophagitis. One patient (4.3%, 1/23) developed anastomotic stenosis, which was resolved with endoscopic dilatation.

Headache was associated with younger age, less comorbidities and reduced mortality, as well as with low levels of C-Reactive Protein, mild acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oropharyngeal symptoms. A logistic multiple regression model revealed that headache was directly associated with D-dimer and creatinine levels, the use of high flow nasal cannula and arthromyalgia, while urea levels, beta-lactamic treatment and hypertension were negatively associated with headache. COVID-19-associated headache characteristics were available in 23/48 (48%) patients. Headache was the onset symptom in 8/20 (40%), of mild or moderate intensity in 17/20 (85%) patients, with oppressive characteristics in 17/18 (94%) and holocranial 8/19 (42%) or temporal 7/19 (37%) localization. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that headache is associated with a more benign SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19-associated headache appears as an early symptom and as a novel headache with characteristics of headache attributed to systemic viral infection. Further research addressing the underlying mechanisms to confirm these findings is warranted.","Gonzalez-Martinez, Alicia; Fanjul, Víctor; Ramos, Carmen; Serrano Ballesteros, Jorge; Bustamante, Marta; Villa Martí, Almudena; Álvarez, Claudia; García Del Álamo, Yaiza; Vivancos, José; Beatriz Gago-Veiga, Ana",European journal of neurology,100,19

Each group was divided into 3 more subgroups depending on the method of remineralization and the applied toothpaste (SENSITIVE ULTRA and SENSODYNE Rapid Relief). To assess teeth hyperesthesia before, immediately after and 14 days after the bleaching procedure, we used the prevalence index of teeth hyperesthesia, the intensity index of teeth hyperesthesia, and the Schiff sample. We also used a digital rating scale for patients. 100 teeth extracted for orthodontic indications were subjected to histological examination. The occurrence of hyperesthesia of teeth during professional bleaching was revealed in 100% of cases. Significant structural changes were registered in the enamel and dentin of the teeth, most pronounced during photo-whitening. The treatment based on zinc-substituted hydroxyapatite carbonate in combination with laserophonophoresis against the background of use the toothpaste SENSODYNE Rapid Relief had the greatest remineralizing effect.","Uspenskaya, O A; Trefilova, O V; Shevchenko, E A",Stomatologiia,100,5

Whether advanced internal cooling is superior to basic external cooling remains unknown. The aim of this multicenter, controlled trial was to evaluate the benefit of endovascular versus basic surface cooling. METHODS AND RESULTS Inclusion criteria were the following: age of 18 to 79 years, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest related to a presumed cardiac cause, time to return of spontaneous circulation <60 minutes, delay between return of spontaneous circulation and inclusion <240 minutes, and unconscious patient after return of spontaneous circulation and before the start of cooling. Exclusion criteria were terminal disease, pregnancy, known coagulopathy, uncontrolled bleeding, temperature on admission <30°C, in-hospital cardiac arrest, immediate need for extracorporeal life support or hemodialysis. Patients were randomized between 2 cooling strategies: endovascular femoral devices (Icy catheter, Coolgard, Zoll, formerly Alsius; n=203) or basic external cooling using fans, a homemade tent, and ice packs (n=197). The primary end point, that is, favorable outcome evaluated by survival without major neurological damage (Cerebral Performance Categories 1-2) at day 28, was not significantly different between groups (odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.93-2.16; P=0.107). Improvement in favorable outcome at day 90 in favor of the endovascular group did not reach significance (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-2.35; P=0.07). Time to target temperature (33°C) was significantly shorter and target hypothermia was more strictly maintained in the endovascular than in the surface group (P<0.001). Minor side effects directly related to the cooling method were observed more frequently in the endovascular group (P=0.009). CONCLUSION Despite better hypothermia induction and maintenance, endovascular cooling was not significantly superior to basic external cooling in terms of favorable outcome.

Deterioration in asthma control is common when patients are exposed to airway irritants, viruses, and/or when adherence to chronic anti-inflammatory medications is suboptimal. Acute asthma exacerbations are common, important reasons for presentations to emergency departments, and severe cases may result in hospitalization. Important knowledge gaps exist in what is known and what care is delivered at the bedside. RECENT FINDINGS The literature in asthma is rapidly expanding and recent advances in the care are important to summarize. Systematic reviews, especially high-quality syntheses performed using Cochrane methods, provide the best evidence for busy clinicians to remain current. Management of asthma is based on early recognition of severe disease with aggressive therapy using multimodal interventions that focus on both bronchoconstriction and inflammatory mechanisms. SUMMARY Treatment of severe acute asthma can effectively and safely reduce hospitalizations, airway interventions, and even death. Using the approach outlined herein will enable clinicians to assist patients to rapidly regain asthma control, return to normal activities, and improve their quality of life in the follow-up period.","Rowe, Brian H; Sevcik, William; Villa-Roel, Cristina",Current opinion in critical care,100,19

We aimed to provide an up-to-date review and critical appraisal of the efficacy and safety of all previous interventions aiming to reduce AL risk. METHODS We searched MEDLINE and Embase from 1946 to January 2019 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating interventions to minimize esophagogastric AL. Pooled risk ratios (RR) for AL were obtained using a random effects model. RESULTS Two reviewers screened 441 abstracts and identified 17 RCTs eligible for inclusion; 11 studies were meta-analyzed. Omentoplasty significantly reduced the risk of AL by 78% [RR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.50] compared to conventional anastomosis (3 studies, n = 611 patients). Early removal of NG tube significantly reduced the risk of AL by 62% [RR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.65] compared to prolonged NG tube removal (2 studies, n = 293 patients); Stapled anastomosis did not significantly reduce the risk of AL [RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.45, 1.87] compared to hand-sewn anastomosis (6 studies, n = 1454 patients). The quality of evidence was high for omentoplasty (vs. conventional anastomosis), moderate for early NG tube removal (vs. prolonged NG tube removal), and very low for stapled anastomosis (vs. hand-sewn anastomosis). CONCLUSIONS This is the first meta-analysis to summarize the graded quality of evidence for all RCT interventions designed to reduce the risk of AL following esophagectomy. Our findings demonstrated that omentoplasty significantly reduced the risk of AL with a high quality of evidence. Although early NG tube removal significantly reduced AL risk, there is a need for further research to strengthen the quality of evidence for this finding. Evidence profiles presented in our review may help inform the development of future clinical practice recommendations.

METHODS Patients undergoing laparoscopic liver resection between July 2005 and July 2008 were included. Indications for resections included presumed benign and malignant liver lesions. Primary outcome was total length of hospital stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes were functional recovery, complications, conversions, blood loss and duration of operation. RESULTS Thirteen patients were treated by laparoscopic liver resections in the ERAS programme in one centre (group 1). Their outcomes were compared with outcomes of 13 laparoscopic procedures performed either before the introduction of the ERAS programme during 2003-2005 in the same centre or during the same period in other centres using traditional care (group 2). Median total LOS was 5.0 days (range 3-10 days) in group 1 and 7.0 days (3-12 days) in group 2. This difference was not statistically significant. Functional recovery occurred 2 days earlier in group 1 (median 3.0 days [range 1-7 days] vs. median 5.0 days [range 2-8 days]; P < 0.044). There were no significant differences in complications, conversions or duration of operation. Blood loss was significantly less in the ERAS group (median 50 ml [range 50-200 ml] vs. median 250 ml [range 50-800 ml]; P < 0.002). CONCLUSIONS This exploratory, multicentre, fast-track laparoscopic liver resection study is the first such study conducted. Although small, the study suggests that a multimodal enhanced recovery programme in laparoscopic liver surgery is feasible, safe and may lead to accelerated functional recovery and reductions in LOS.","Stoot, Jan H; van Dam, Ronald M; Busch, Olivier R; van Hillegersberg, Richard; De Boer, Marieke; Olde Damink, Steven W M; Bemelmans, Marc H; Dejong, Cornelis H C",HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,100,1

However, reversible hydrogel adhesives that can be used for gelid conditions were rarely reported. In this work, we have developed a freezing-tolerant (freezing temperature < -50 °C), ultra-stretchable (stretch strain > 30000% at 25 °C) glycerol-ionic hydrogel via the ultraviolet curing of acrylamide monomer and hyper-branched polyethylenimine polymer in CaCl2-water-glycerol solution. The fabricated hydrogel exhibited reversible gelid adhesion, rapid self-healing (recover in 3 s) and weight-retaining (>2 weeks) properties. The hydrogel allows two iron substrates to adhere together at -40 °C with the lap-shear adhesion strength as high as ~1 MPa. Such strong adhesion measured was reversible, specifically achieving ~100% of initial adhesion strength at 25 °C and ~36% at -40 °C. Additionally, decreasing the testing temperature significantly improved the tensile strength but decreased the fracture strain of the hydrogel. Interestingly, lap-shear adhesion tests suggested that the gelid adhesion strength was enhanced by 130 times as the testing temperature decreased from 25 °C to -40 °C, which was mainly attributed to the enhanced mechanical strength of the bulk hydrogel as well as the increased surface interaction at gel-substrate interfaces. More importantly, the adhesion failure gradually changed from cohesive failure to adhesive failure as the temperature decreased. This work provides new practical and fundamental insights into developing multifunctional freezing-tolerant hydrogel adhesive for gelid conditions.","Yan, Yonggan; Huang, Jun; Qiu, Xiaoyong; Cui, Xin; Xu, Shulei; Wu, Xunwei; Yao, Peng; Huang, Chuanzhen",Journal of colloid and interface science,100,17

We have found a novel anti-inflammatory pathway that is initiated by the acute phase protein, C-reactive protein (CRP), interacting with Fcγ receptor (FcγR) on monocytes. This pathway is protective in animal models of endotoxin shock. We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in the FcγR might contribute to monocyte responses and susceptibility to infectious complications after severe trauma. METHODS We conducted an observational study on a prospectively identified cohort of adult patients with convenience enrollment admitted after severe trauma. We enrolled 66 patients and collected blood samples at enrollment and again at 48 hours and 72 hours. Patients were followed through their hospital stay, and any septic events before 14 days were recorded. Cytokine and CRP levels were determined in the plasma from all three blood draws. In addition, DNA was extracted from blood and analyzed for the 131 H/R FcγRIIa polymorphism that strongly affects the binding of IgG and CRP to this receptor. RESULTS Elevated levels of interleukin 8 (IL-8), IL-6, IL-10, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and CRP were associated with reduced time to posttraumatic sepsis in Cox regression analysis. Expression of monocyte human leukocyte antigen DR less than 45% on patient monocytes was also associated with sepsis (hazard ratio, 3.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.45-6.93). Genetic analysis found that individuals with the polymorphism of the FcγRIIa receptor that binds CRP poorly were also more likely to have decreased monocyte human leukocyte antigen DR and posttraumatic sepsis. In vitro studies showed that CRP could attenuate monocyte deactivation in volunteers with the polymorphism of the FcγRIIa receptor that binds CRP. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that a common genetic variation in the FcγRIIa receptor may contribute to infectious susceptibility in trauma patients. In vitro experiments suggest that this association is related to the inability of CRP to bind to this FcγRIIa receptor variant.

The genome of the new bastrovirus is 5,955 nt long and contains two open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes a protein containing three domains, viral methyltransferase, RNA helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and is closely related to the RdRp of hepatitis E virus. The ORF2 protein shares similarities with the astrovirus capsid precursor protein. Although structural features of bastroviruses may resemble those of astroviruses, distinct characteristics of the newly identified bastrovirus include the presence of an RNA helicase domain in ORF1 and the lack of ORF1b. In addition to genetic characterization, screening of 368 porcine samples (oral fluids, oral swabs or fecal swabs) collected in the United States (US) using a porcine-bastrovirus-specific real-time PCR assay revealed that 31% of those samples were positive.

MATERIALS AND METHODS In 2009-2011, we performed 124 lung biopsies (66 CNB and 56 FNAB) on 121 patients with a mean age of 72.4 years. Exclusion criteria were pulmonary resection, pleural lesions and/or effusions, and inadequate blood-coagulation profile. All examinations were acquired after contrast-agent administration in a craniocaudal direction from the lung apex to base during a single inspiratory breath-hold, with standardised parameters. Each lesion was scanned with 13-15 slices that could be repeated whenever necessary to document the needle track and for lesion centring, by positioning a metallic marker perpendicular to the centring light to indicate the point of needle access. Unless otherwise clinically indicated, 4 h after the procedure chest radiography was performed. RESULTS Age was found to be a factor influencing the complications: pneumothorax in young subjects (31 %) and parenchymal haemorrhage in the elderly (30 %), with CNB but not with FNAB. We had more complications with the right lung: 50 % of pneumothorax cases in the upper lobe with CNB and 40 % of cases of haemorrhage in the lower lobe with FNAB. The anterior approach gave rise to more complications with CNB, while the posterior approach with FNAB. CNB had more complications than FNAB for lesions ≤ 3.5 cm (31 vs. 18 % pneumothorax), and >3.5 cm (34 vs. 9 % haemorrhage). There was no significant correlation with lesion histology, needle calibre or number of passes (probably due to the small number of procedures done with needles other than 18 G in CNB or 22 G in FNAB or involving more than one needle pass). The diagnostic accuracy of FNAB, done with a pathologist's extemporaneous assessment of sample adequacy, was 94.83 % against 81.82. % of CNB. CONCLUSIONS FNAB under CT guidance is subject to a lower rate of complications and, if performed in the presence of the pathologist, has a greater diagnostic accuracy compared to CNB.","Capalbo, Emanuela; Peli, Michela; Lovisatti, Maria; Cosentino, Maria; Mariani, Paola; Berti, Eisabetta; Cariati, Maurizio",La Radiologia medica,100,23

Importantly, ICAC can be subtyped into a medial or intimal pattern that may differentially influence the effect of EVT in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Methods- All 500 patients included in the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical trial of Endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands) were evaluated. Volume (mm3) and location pattern (tunica intima or tunica media) of ICAC could be determined on baseline noncontrast computed tomography in 344 patients. Functional outcome at 90 days was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale. Next, we investigated the association of ICAC volume and pattern with functional outcome using adjusted ordinal logistic regression models. Effect modification by EVT was assessed with an interaction term between treatment allocation and ICAC aspect. Results- We found evidence for treatment effect modification by ICAC pattern ( P interaction=0.04). Patients with predominantly medial calcification had better functional outcome with EVT than without this treatment (adjusted common odds ratio, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.23-4.39), but we observed no effect of EVT in patients with predominantly intimal calcifications (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.40-1.68). We did not find an association of ICAC volume with functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio per unit increase ICAC volume 1.01 (95% CI, 0.89-1.13). Moreover, we found no evidence for effect modification by ICAC volume ( P interaction=0.61). Conclusions- The benefit of EVT in acute ischemic stroke patients with a medial calcification pattern is larger than the benefit in patients with an intimal calcification pattern.

METHODS A total of 2,779 cancer patients took part in an observational and lateral study carried out between April 16, 2020 and April 25, 2020. An online questionnaire was distributed including distress-related variables, demographic variables, clinical variables about their oncological condition, socioeconomic variables and variables related to information management and social communication. Distress was measured according to the Kessler (K-6) scale, and its relationship with the remaining variables was analyzed by logistic regression. RESULTS 33.5% of the patients yielded levels of clinical distress during lockdown. Younger patients and women yielded significantly higher levels of distress. High distress levels were generally associated with the following factors: trust in medical institutions; deterioration of the household's financial conditions; and media management of the information about the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The lockdown triggered by COVID-19 increased distress among cancer patients, and this can be significantly related to a number of variables. Identifying distress, and said factors, at an early stage can help to develop mitigation strategies. Similarly, early detection can help to improve the way information is shared with patients, offer them support and resources and direct them to psychosocial services, increasing the patient's ability to return to normal after COVID-19.","Yélamos Agua, Carmen; Berzal Pérez, Elisabeth; de Haro Gázquez, Diego; Fernández Sánchez, Belén; Navarro Jiménez, José Miguel",Journal of psychosocial oncology,100,16

The lifestyle and lowered daily activity of elderly adults, along with the deficit of motor and cognitive brain functions, might lead to the developed ambidexterity, i.e., the loss of dominant limb advances. Despite the broad knowledge about the changes in cortical activity directly related to the motor execution, less is known about age-related differences in the motor initiation phase. We hypothesize that the latter strongly influences the behavioral characteristics, such as reaction time, the accuracy of motor performance, etc. Here, we compare the neuronal processes underlying the motor initiation phase preceding fine motor task execution between elderly and young subjects. Based on the results of the whole-scalp sensor-level electroencephalography (EEG) analysis, we demonstrate that the age-related slowing down in the motor initiation before the dominant hand movements is accompanied by the increased theta activation within sensorimotor area and reconfiguration of the theta-band functional connectivity in elderly adults.","Frolov, Nikita S; Pitsik, Elena N; Maksimenko, Vladimir A; Grubov, Vadim V; Kiselev, Anton R; Wang, Zhen; Hramov, Alexander E",PloS one,100,1

In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to evaluate the feasibilityof the IFD. BACKGROUND Although distal atheromatous and thrombotic embolizations remain unresolved critical issues during catheter interventions, distal protection devices are infrequently used partly because of reduced lower maneuverability. METHODS In the in vitro experiment, we created an experimental circulation model composed of silicone latex tubes, a reservoir, and a roller pump. After the filter device was deployed in the tube, polystyrene fluorescent microspheres were injected and the capture rate was calculated. Ten trials were performed using the IFD and Spider FX. In the in vivo study, five independent operators deployed, and they retrieved the IFD in swine common iliac and internal carotid arteries. The procedural success rate as well as the delivery and retrieval time was evaluated. RESULTS In the in vitro study, the mean capture rate was 94% and 35% in the IFD and Spider groups, respectively. In the in vivo study, all procedures were successful, with no complications. The mean delivery time was 281 ± 87 s and 194 ± 67 s and the mean retrieval time was 24 ± 9 and 13 ±1 s in the left internal carotid and the left common iliac arteries, respectively. CONCLUSION Although further studies and improvements are required, the study results indicate that the IFD is feasible.","Watanabe, Hiroki; Saito, Naritatsu; Nagata, Yoshimasa; Yamamoto, Erika; Nakatsuma, Kenji; Bingyuan, Bao; Watanabe, Shin; Tazaki, Junichi; Kimura, Takeshi; Inoue, Kanji",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,100,1

OBJECTIVES This study aimed to determine the satisfaction and stress levels of dentistry students in Turkey regarding distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to evaluate their opinions on this matter. MATERIAL AND METHODS This cross-sectional research study was conducted from October to November 2020 with the use of a web-based questionnaire consisting of 3 sections. The 1st section focused on demographic data. The 2nd section evaluated dentistry students' opinions regarding distance education during the pandemic; it comprised 8 multiple-choice questions and 1 open-ended question. The 3rd section referred to the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), which is intended to assess the stress levels. The data was subjected to the descriptive statistical analysis, the χ2 tests and the logistic regression analysis. RESULTS The sample consisted of 919 dentistry students, reflecting a response rate of 84%. Of the total sample, 81.6% of the participants were studying at state universities and more than half were female. These students' perceived stress levels were significantly increased due to the following factors: education at a state school; insufficient technical opportunities at home/dormitory facilities; decreased support from the academic staff of the universities during distance education; and a low level of knowledge of online document usage (p < 0.05). The evaluation of the responses to the open-ended question indicated that the difficulties encountered by highly stressed students during distance education were mostly adaptationrelated (p = 0.011). The logistic regression analysis showed that gender was significantly associated with high stress levels (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The data showed that dentistry students preferred hybrid education and were unsatisfied with their experience with distance education.","Ertürk Avunduk, Ayşe Tuğba; Delikan, Ebru",Dental and medical problems,100,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 65 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) who sought medical aid at the Ophthalmological Center of FMBA during the COVID-19 pandemic; they were examined using three tonometry methods: RBT, TPT and CDT. All patients underwent central corneal thickness measurement, perimetry, OCT and OCTA with assessment of vessel density (VD) of the superficial plexus in the macula (whole image macula) and peripapillary retina (PPR). RESULTS High correlation was found between the results obtained with RBT, TPT and CDT. None of the methods showed a correlation between IOP and corneal thickness. The correlations between IOP and OCTA parameters were obtained: IOPTPT and VDPPR in the inferior temporal sector (r= -0.386, p=0.027), IOPRBT and VD whole image macula (r= -0.69, p=0.019), and in the macula inferior hemisphere (r= -0.75, p=0.008), as well as between the ocular pulse amplitude (OPA) and VD in the macular inferior hemisphere (r=0.380, p=0.039). The OCTA parameters had a moderate, but significant correlation with the perimetric indices. CONCLUSIONS Tonometry methods (TPB, CDT and RBT) exhibit high correlation with each other and no correlation with corneal thickness. IOP parameters measured by different methods, especially using the Icare tonometer, correlate with OCTA parameters, and the latter - with perimetric indices. The combination of these tonometry methods with SD-OCT and OCTA is optimal for examining patients during the pandemic.","Kurysheva, N I; Pechenkina, A A; Goncharova, A S",Vestnik oftalmologii,100,1

Because normal body temperatures show large variations, the same may be expected for increased temperatures in fever. The aims were to study variations in normothermic body temperatures measured with an ear thermometer and to determine differences between actual and perceived body temperature during a febrile episode (referred to as difftemp) in apparently healthy children and adults. METHODS Ear temperature was measured once in 2,006 individuals (61.7% females): 683 children aged 2 and 4 years, 492 adolescents aged 10-18 years, 685 adults aged 19-65 years and 146 elderly aged 66-89 years. Difftemp was estimated as the difference between the individual's ear body temperature, measured in the present study, and the respondent's reported temperature when feverish. RESULTS Mean ear temperature was 36.4 ± 0.6°C overall and in the child and adult groups. In adolescents, it was 36.5 ± 0.5°C, and in elderly, 36.1 ± 0.5°C. Temperature in men was 36.3 ± 0.6°C, and in women, 36.5 ± 0.5°C. Difftemp was 1.1 ± 0.7°C in adolescents, 1.5 ± 0.7°C in children and adults, and 1.6 ± 0.7°C in those >65 years. CONCLUSIONS Ear body temperature is lower than traditionally reported and differs with age and sex. An individual difftemp of 1.0-1.5°C along with malaise might indicate fever.","Levander, Märta Sund; Grodzinsky, Ewa",The American journal of the medical sciences,100,16

Discharge on the same day as treatment may increase the efficiency and throughput. There are limited data regarding the safety of this strategy. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients undergoing AF ablation in a tertiary centre and in a district general hospital, and identified those discharged on the same day of treatment. The safety endpoint was any complication and/or presentation to hospital in the 48-hours and at 30 days post discharge. We performed an economic analysis to calculate potential cost saving. RESULTS Among a total population of 2628 patients, we identified 727 subjects (61.1±12.5 years, 69.6% male) undergoing day-case AF ablation. Cryoballoon technique was used in 79.2% of the day-cases, and 91.6% of the procedures were performed under conscious sedation. 1.8% (13) of the participants met the safety composite endpoint at 48-hour, however only 0.7% (5) required at least one day of hospitalisation. Bleeding/haematoma at the femoral access site (0.5%) and pericarditic chest pain (0.5%) were the main reasons for readmission. None experienced cardiac tamponade or other life-threatening complications in the 48-hours post-discharge. Overall rate of complication and/or presentation to hospital at 30 days was 3.7%. Our day-case policy resulted in an annual cost-saving of approximately of £83,927 for our hospital. CONCLUSION In this large multicentre cohort, same-day discharge in selected patients following AF ablation appears to be safe and cost-effective, with a very low rate of early readmission or post-discharge complication.

SETTING Single-centre level IV neonatal intensive care unit. PATIENTS Neonates 24-29 weeks' gestation less than 12 hours old with invasive blood pressure monitoring. DESIGN Cerebral saturations and mean arterial blood pressure were recorded every 30 s for 96 hours. For each 10 min epoch, the correlation coefficient (r) was calculated for mean arterial blood pressure versus cerebral saturations. The epoch was considered to have ICA if r>0.5 and CR if r<0. RESULTS Sixty-one subjects were included. During the first 96 hours, ICA occurred 17.6% and CR occurred 41% of recorded time. In those without adverse outcomes, ICA decreased and CR increased by postnatal day (p<0.05). Adjusted for birth weight and gestational age, those with IVH and those who died spent more time with ICA and less time with CR (p<0.05) over the entire recording period. Those with IVH had 1.5-fold increase in time with ICA on day 2 (p=0.021), and decrease in time with CR on day 3 (p=0.036). Compared with survivors, non-survivors spent more time with ICA on days 3 and 4 (p<0.005), and less with CR on day 3 (p=0.032). CONCLUSION ICA and CR vary by postnatal day and these patterns are associated with adverse outcomes.","Hoffman, Suma B; Cheng, Yun-Ju; Magder, Laurence S; Shet, Narendra; Viscardi, Rose M",Archives of disease in childhood.

METHODS Qualitative interviews were conducted with stakeholders (N=14) and peer specialists (N=37) to better understand delivery of peer support services for justice-involved individuals in Pennsylvania. Thematic analysis followed by directed content analysis was used to identify factors in three a priori implementation categories based on the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) model: initial facilitators (adoption), barriers (implementation), and facilitators (maintenance) to long-term sustainability. RESULTS Initial service adoption was facilitated by buy-in from recovery-oriented gatekeepers in the criminal justice system. Unique implementation barriers included the chasm between the orientations of the two systems (recovery vs. punitive) and formal and informal limitations on the employment of individuals with criminal justice system exposure. For services to be sustainable and have an impact over the long term, FPS advocates and workers must develop rapport with on-the-ground employees of the criminal justice system. Funding barriers specific to the criminal justice system limited the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of FPS services. CONCLUSIONS Although many of the factors that affect FPS service implementation were similar to those identified in the broader peer support literature, important differences must be addressed for successful FPS service delivery. Within the criminal justice system, both policies and norms presented barriers to the expansion of peer support services for justice-involved individuals.","Adams, Wallis E; Lincoln, Alisa K",Psychiatric services,100,1

METHODS Data were collected from 182 randomly selected children aged 6-13 years in primary schools in central Poland. Measures included anthropometric dimensions, body composition, questionnaires completed by participants' parents, and saliva samples. The level of 25(OH)D was assessed from the saliva samples using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. The children were divided into two groups: pre-pubertal (girls below 10 years and boys below 11 years) and pubertal individuals (girls above 10 years and boys above 11 years). RESULTS The 25(OH)D concentrations were higher in late spring (June) among pre-pubertal children than in the autumn (November-December) among pubertal children. The level of 25(OH)D was positively correlated with body cell mass (BCM,%) among all children (pubertal: R = 0.20, P = .044; pre-pubertal: R = 0.23, P = .041) and inversely associated with waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) among pubertal children of both sexes (R = -0.25; P = .031). The stepwise regression analysis revealed that investigation in spring (June) and breastfeeding was associated with increased muscle mass (MM, %) (beta = 0.253, P = .003 and beta = 0.225, P = .005, respectively) and total body water (TBW, %) (beta = 0.276, P = .004 and beta = 0.246, P = .011, respectively) and was associated with decreased body mass index (BMI; beta = -0.222, P = .024 and beta = -0.269, P = .009, respectively) and fat mass (%) (beta = -0.288, P = .003 and beta = -0.266, P = .005, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Season of salivary sampling and breastfeeding status were more strongly associated with body components, BMI and WHR, than 25(OH)D concentrations.","Pruszkowska-Przybylska, Paulina; Sitek, Aneta; Rosset, Iwona; Sobalska-Kwapis, Marta; Słomka, Marcin; Strapagiel, Dominik; Żądzińska, Elżbieta; Morling, Niels",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,100,19

Our study aims to explore the effects of medical masks on healthy people in acoustic, aerodynamic and formant parameters during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we also attempted to verify the differences between different sexes and ages. METHODS Fifty-three healthy participants (25 males and 28 females) were involved in our study. The acoustic parameters, including fundamental frequency (F0), sound pressure level (SPL), percentage of jitter (%), percentage of shimmer (%), noise to harmonic ratio (NHR) and cepstral peak prominence (CPP), aerodynamic parameter (maximum phonation time, MPT) and formant parameters (formant frequency, F1, F2, F3) without and with wearing medical masks were included. We further investigated the potential differences in the impact on different sexes and ages (≤45 years old and >45 years old). RESULTS While wearing medical masks, the SPL significantly increased (71.22±4.25 dB, 72.42±3.96 dB, P = 0.021). Jitter and shimmer significantly decreased (jitter 1.19±0.83, 0.87±0.67 P = 0.005; shimmer 4.49±2.20, 3.66±2.02 P = 0.002), as did F3 (2855±323.34 Hz, 2781.89±353.42 Hz P = 0.004). F0, MPT, F1 and F2 showed increasing trends without statistical significance, and NHR as well as CPP showed little change without and with wearing medical masks. There were no significant differences seen between males and females. Regarding to age, a significant difference in MPT was seen (>45-year-old 16.15±6.98 s, 15.38±7.02 s; ≤45-year-old 20.26±6.47 s, 21.44±6.98 s, P = 0.032). CONCLUSION Healthy participants showed a significantly higher SPL, a smaller perturbation and an evident decrease in F3 after wearing medical masks. These changes may result from the adjustment of the vocal tract and the filtration function of medical masks, leading to the stability of voices we recorded being overstated. The impacts of medical masks on sex were not evident, while the MPT in the >45-year-old group was influenced more than that in the ≤45-year-old group.","Lin, Yuhong; Cheng, Liyu; Wang, Qingcui; Xu, Wen",Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,100,1

Since January 23rd, 2020, the strategies of containment and contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation has been implemented extensively in mainland China, and the rates of detection and confirmation have been continuously increased, which have effectively suppressed the rapid spread of the epidemic. In the early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19, it is of great practical significance to analyze the transmission risk of the epidemic and evaluate the effectiveness and timeliness of prevention and control strategies by using mathematical models and combining with a small amount of real-time updated multi-source data. On the basis of our previous research, we systematically introduce how to establish the transmission dynamic models in line with current Chinese prevention and control strategies step by step, according to the different epidemic stages and the improvement of the data. By summarized our modelling and assessing ideas, the model formulations vary from autonomous to non-autonomous dynamic systems, the risk assessment index changes from the basic regeneration number to the effective regeneration number, and the epidemic development and assessment evolve from the early SEIHR transmission model-based dynamics to the recent dynamics which are mainly associated with the variation of the isolated and suspected population sizes.","Tang, S Y; Xiao, Y N; Peng, Z H; Shen, H B",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,100,1

Quantitative research to date has documented that many Indigenous communities have lower breastfeeding rates than the general population and that this gap in breastfeeding initiation and maintenance may have an important impact on chronic disease risk later in life. However, there are critical knowledge gaps in the literature regarding factors that influence infant feeding decisions. Qualitative research on infant feeding experiences provides a broader understanding of the challenges that Indigenous caregivers encounter, and insights provided by this approach are essential to identify research gaps, community engagement strategies, and programme and policy development. The objective of this review is to summarise the qualitative literature that describes breastfeeding and other infant feeding experiences of Indigenous caregivers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This scoping review will follow guidelines from Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews, the Joanna Briggs Institute and the methodological framework from Arksey and O'Malley.

A previous study found smaller stroke magnetic resonance imaging lesion growth in seronegative patients, suggesting a neuroprotective effect of these antibodies. The impact of NMDAR1-abs seropositivity on long-term functional outcome and recurrent vascular events and death after first-ever stroke remains unclear. Methods- Data from the Prospective Cohort with Incident Stroke-Berlin were used. NMDAR1-abs (ie, IgM, IgA, and IgG) were measured in serum within 7 days after first stroke. Outcomes of interest included modified Rankin Scale at one year and the time-to-event of a combined end point (recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality) within 3 years. We calculated odds ratios from adjusted partial proportional odds models and subsequently compared outcome of patients with low titers (1:10; 1:32; and 1:100), and high titers (1:320; 1:1000) to seronegative patients. Furthermore, we estimated hazard ratios for a secondary vascular event or death in NMDAR1-abs seropositive compared with patients with seronegative in models adjusted for confounders. Results- The analyses included 583 patients with antibody measurements (39% female, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale:2, IQR:1-4), and NMDAR1-abs were observed in 76 (13%) patients. NMDAR1-abs seroprevalence was not associated with functional outcome (odds ratio=1.27; 95% CI, 0.77-2.09); sub-group analyses, however, showed worse outcome in patients with high titers (odds ratio=3.47; 95% CI, 1.54-7.80). Seropositive patients had an increased risk for a secondary vascular event or death (hazard ratios =1.83, 95% CI, 1.10-3.05). Conclusions- In our study, NMDAR1-abs seropositivity was not associated with functional outcome at one year after stroke, however, high titers (≥1:320) were associated with poor functional outcome. Furthermore, NMDAR1-abs seropositivity was associated with increased cardiovascular risk within 3 years after first stroke, independently from other risk factors.

This study evaluated outcomes of same day discharge (SDD) versus overnight stay (ONS) among AF patients undergoing outpatient CA. METHODS The Optum SES Clinformatics Extended Data Mart database was used to identify patients ≥18 years of age undergoing outpatient CA for AF (2016-2020). Eligible patients were indexed to the date of first CA and classified into SDD and ONS groups based on the length of service. A 1:3 propensity score matching was used to create comparable SDD:ONS samples. The primary safety outcome was CA-related complications within 30 days of index procedure. The primary efficacy outcome was AF recurrence within one year. Cox proportional hazards models were estimated for outcome comparison. RESULTS In the post-match 30-day cohort for safety evaluation, there were 6,600 patients (1,660 [25.2%] SDD; 4940 [74.8%] ONS), with a mean age of 66.6 years. There was no significant difference in the 30-day composite rate of post-ablation complications (4.7% [78/1660] vs. 3.8% [187/4940]; p=0.100) and 1-year composite rate of AF recurrence (14.3% [142/996] vs. 14.5% [430/2972]; p=0.705) between the SDD and ONS groups. CONCLUSION This study demonstrated that SDD following CA to treat patients with AF is safe, with low rates of post-ablation complications and AF recurrence, which were comparable to rates in patients with an ONS after CA.

However, the last decade has seen the discovery and development of the field of native lanthanide biochemistry. Lanthanides exhibit a variety of interesting photophysical properties from which many useful applications derive. The development of effective functional lanthanide complexes requires control of their coordination sphere; something proteins manage very effectively through their 3D metal-binding sites. α-Helical coiled coil peptides are miniature scaffolds which can be designed de novo and can retain the favourable properties of larger proteins within a much simplified system. Metal binding sites, including those which bind lanthanides can be engineered into the coiled coil sequence. This review will highlight the opportunities presented by the use of coiled coil peptides as scaffolds for lanthanide binding and the potential to control the coordination environment by simple modifications to peptide sequence. Designed lanthanide coiled coils offer opportunities to gain greater insight into native lanthanide biochemistry as well as to develop new functional complexes, including imaging agents.","Webster, Alexandra M; Peacock, Anna F A",Chemical communications,100,12

In Canada, there is limited data to quantify and characterize this issue. METHODS We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study by distributing online surveys to physicians across Ontario. The survey included three sections: provider characteristics, impact of COVID-19 on professional practice, and impact of COVID-19 on routine childhood immunization services. Multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with modification of immunization services. RESULTS A total of 475 respondents answered the survey from May 27th to July 3rd 2020, including 189 family physicians and 286 pediatricians. The median proportion of in-person visits reported by physicians before the pandemic was 99% and dropped to 18% during the first wave of the pandemic in Ontario. In total, 175 (44.6%) of the 392 respondents who usually provide vaccination to children acknowledged a negative impact caused by the pandemic on their immunization services, ranging from temporary closure of their practice (n = 18; 4.6%) to postponement of vaccines in certain age groups (n = 103; 26.3%). Pediatricians were more likely to experience a negative impact on their immunization services compared to family physicians (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.48-4.68), as well as early career physicians compared to their more senior colleagues (aOR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.30-5.56), whereas physicians from suburban settings were less impacted than physicians from urban settings (aOR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.39-0.99). Some of the proposed solutions to decreased immunization services included assistance in accessing personal protective equipment, dedicated centers or practices for vaccination, universal centralized electronic immunization records and education campaigns for parents. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 has caused substantial modifications to pediatric immunization services across Ontario. Strategies to mitigate barriers to immunizations during the pandemic need to be implemented in order to avoid immunity gaps that could lead to an eventual increase in vaccine preventable diseases.","Piché-Renaud, Pierre-Philippe; Ji, Catherine; Farrar, Daniel S; Friedman, Jeremy N; Science, Michelle; Kitai, Ian; Burey, Sharon; Feldman, Mark; Morris, Shaun K",Vaccine,100,24

Vitamin D is a key modulator of the immune system. We hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency (VDD) could increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. METHODS patients with confirmed COVID-19 seen at the emergency department of our hospital with recent measurements of 25(OH)D were recruited. We explored the association of vitamin D deficiency (VDD), defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 ng/mL, with a composite of adverse clinical outcomes. RESULTS we included 80 patients, of which 31 (39 %) presented the endpoint. VDD tended to predict an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 after adjusting for age, gender, obesity, cardiac disease, and kidney disease [OR 3.2 (95 % CI: 0.9-11.4), p = 0.07]. Age had a negative interaction with the effect of VDD on the composite outcome (p = 0.03), indicating that the effect was more noticeable at younger ages. Furthermore, male gender was associated with VDD and with severe COVID-19 at younger ages. CONCLUSIONS in this retrospective study, vitamin D deficiency showed a signal of association with severe COVID-19 infection. A significant interaction with age was noted, suggesting VDD may have a greater impact in younger patients. These findings should be confirmed in larger, prospective, adequately powered studies.","Macaya, Fernando; Espejo Paeres, Carolina; Valls, Adrián; Fernández-Ortiz, Antonio; González Del Castillo, Juan; Martín-Sánchez, Javier; Runkle, Isabelle; Rubio Herrera, Miguel Ángel",Nutricion hospitalaria,100,24

To identify positive strategies for midwifery education in this context, five case studies from the UK and beyond were conducted using an appreciative enquiry approach, from the perspectives of students, the maternity services, cross-university collaboration, and digital learning. A health system analysis was used to identify strategies to cope, adapt, and transform for the future, at the levels of individuals, teams, and the whole system. Findings showed that the implementation of effective responses was possible. Responding effectively and rapidly to a shock as profound as this pandemic requires courageous, respectful, evidence-based, innovative, collaborative, cross-sectoral working and leadership across education institutions, practice settings, the regulator, government, and with students themselves. Pre-existing trusting relationships and collaborative systems supported rapid responses. Effective digital learning requires a pro-active, student-centred approach, and addressing the problems of inequitable access to equipment and space. Joint problem-solving and focussing on the key outcomes that matter contribute to developing successful strategies and robust processes. The pandemic provides an opportunity for student midwives to be re-imagined as essential members of midwifery teams and not 'just students'. Transformative actions identified include whole-system working, tackling longstanding problems including racism, poverty, prejudice, and systemic discrimination, and keeping students at the heart of the education system.","Renfrew, Mary J; Bradshaw, Gwendolen; Burnett, Alicia; Byrom, Anna; Entwistle, Francesca; King, Kay; Olayiwola, Wendy; Thomas, Grace",Midwifery,100,1

Drawing on event system theory and literature on job insecurity, we conceptualize COVID-19 as an event relevant to employees' work, and propose that event strength (i.e., novelty, disruption, and criticality) of COVID-19 influences employee job insecurity, which in turn affects employee work and non-work outcomes. We also identified important organization adaptive practices responding to COVID-19 based on a preliminary interview study, and examined its role in mitigating the undesired effects of COVID-19 event strength. Results from a two-wave lagged survey study indicated that employees' perceived COVID-19 event novelty and disruption (but not criticality) were positively related to their job insecurity, which in turn was positively related to their emotional exhaustion, organizational deviance, and saving behavior. Moreover, organization adaptive practices mitigated the effects of COVID-19 event novelty and criticality (but not disruption) on job insecurity. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

Different drug targets are discussed in order to identify new molecules or new combinations as candidates to manage SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 infections. EXPERT OPINION The development of novel molecules and vaccines has been a challenge during this urgent crisis. Nucleoside analogues and IL-6 receptor antagonists have been identified as the best candidates for treatment of this disease. The results of ongoing clinical trials for many antiviral drugs and vaccines are being awaited eagerly to confirm promising treatments for SARS CoV2. Multi-drug therapy by targeting different pathways will need to be corroborated and then confirmed through clinical trials.

However, there is a paucity of respiratory viral surveillance studies in CRS patients, and such studies could elucidate the potential role of viruses in promoting symptoms and aggravating mucosal inflammation. Therefore, a prospective case-control study was conducted to determine the prevalence of respiratory viruses in CRS patients and non-CRS controls. Nasal lavage fluids and turbinate epithelial cells were collected prospectively from 111 CRS patients and 50 controls. Multiplex PCR was used to identify common respiratory viruses in both sample types and the infection rate was compared between groups. Respiratory viruses were detected in 50.5% of lavage samples and in 64.0% of scraping samples from CRS patients. The overall infection rate was significantly different in CRS patients and controls (odds ratio, 2.9 in lavage and 4.1 in scraping samples). Multiple viral infections were detected more frequently in lavage samples from CRS patients than those from controls (P < 0.01; odds ratio, 7.7). Rhinovirus was the most prevalent virus and the only virus with a significantly different infection rate in CRS patients and controls in both samples (odds ratio, 3.2 in lavage and 3.4 in scraping samples). This study detected a higher prevalence of respiratory viruses in CRS patients than controls, suggesting that there may be significant associations between inflammation of CRS and respiratory viruses, particularly rhinovirus. Further studies should investigate the exact role of highly prevalent respiratory viruses in CRS patients during symptomatic aggravation and ongoing mucosal inflammation.","Cho, Gye Song; Moon, Byung-Jae; Lee, Bong-Jae; Gong, Chang-Hoon; Kim, Nam Hee; Kim, You-Sun; Kim, Hun Sik; Jang, Yong Ju",Journal of clinical microbiology,100,31

We present our clinical practices and patients' outcomes after elective, emergent, and urgent cardiovascular surgery and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). We also investigated the rate of nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 in health workers (HWs), including surgeons after cardiovascular procedures and percutaneous interventions (PCI). MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed 186 cardiovascular operations and PCI between March 15 and October 15. According to the level of priority (LoP), we performed urgent and emergent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and cardiac valve repair or replacement surgery in 44 patients. In one patient with acute chordae rupture with pulmonary edema, we performed mitral valve replacement. We performed the aortic arch repair in two patients with type-I aortic dissection in urgent situations. Therefore, in 47 patients we performed cardiac operations in urgent or emergent situations. Elective CABG (N = 28) and elective cardiac valve (N = 10) surgeries were performed (total: 38). While rescue PCI was urgently performed in 47 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), it was performed in elective or emergent situations in 40 patients with myocardial ischemia. Endovascular treatment was performed in four patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and in four patients with chronic arterial occlusion, respectively. Surgical vascular repair and embolectomy were performed in patients with peripheral artery injury (N = 6) and acute arterial embolic events (N = 4), respectively. We performed thoracic computed tomography followed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in patients with irregular diffuse reticular opacities with or without consolidation on chest X-ray. Blood coagulation disorders including d-dimer, thromboplastin time (TT), and partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were measured prior to procedures. RESULTS No mortality and morbidity was seen after percutaneous and surgical arterial or venous procedures. The total mortality rate was 4.1% (8 of 186 CAD patients or valve surgery) after urgent and emergent CABG (N = 4), an urgent valve replacement (N = 1), and PCI (N = 3). Low cardiac output syndrome (LOS) and major adverse cardiac cerebrovascular event (MACCE) were the mortality factors after cardiac surgery. The reasons for death after PCI were sudden cardiac arrest related to the dissection of the left main coronary artery during procedure and pneumonia due to COVID-19 (N = 2). Ground-glass opacities in combination with pulmonary consolidations were detected in seven patients. Interlobular septal and pleural thickening with patchy bronchiectasis in the bilateral lower lobe involvement was found after thoracic computed tomography in these patients. We confirmed in-hospital COVID-19 using a PCR test in two patients with STEMI prior to PCI. PT and aPTT increased, but fibrin degradation products did not in those two patients. We confirmed COVID-19 via phone call in six CABG patients and one PCI patient after discharge from the hospital. None of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 died after being discharged from the hospital. CONCLUSION Cardiovascular surgery and PCI can safely be performed with acceptable complications and mortality rates in elective situations, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Preoperative control of OR traffic, careful evaluation of the patient's history, consultation, and precautions taken by healthcare professionals are important, during and after procedures. Also important is wearing a mask and face shield and careful disinfection of equipment and space.","Keskin, Gökhan; Khalil, Emced; Uysal, Ayhan",The heart surgery forum,100,1

Liver surgeons have attempted to reproduce this method laparoscopically. In this study, we introduce our technique of the extrahepatic Glissonean approach for anatomic liver resections, using a robotic system, and report on short-term perioperative outcomes. METHODS From December 2008 to July 2014, 10 patients underwent robotic anatomic liver resection in the right liver. The procedure is as follows: (1) mobilization of the liver and isolation and clamping of a selected Glissonean pedicle; (2) transection of the liver parenchyma using a rubber band retraction technique; (3) division of the Glissonean pedicle after full exposure, followed by completion of parenchymal transection. RESULTS The median age of the patients was 52.50 (range 28-59) years, and seven were male. All patients had hepatocellular carcinoma. The types of resections performed were as follows: segmentectomy 6 (n = 1), segmentectomy of 4b + 5 ventral segments (n = 2), right posterior sectionectomy (n = 3), extended right hepatectomy (n = 1), extended right posterior sectionectomy (n = 2), and central bisectionectomy (n = 1). Only one case was converted to open surgery due to severe tumor adhesions on the diaphragm. The median operative time was 555 min (range 413-848), and the median estimated blood loss was 225 ml (range 30-700), with no perioperative transfusions. The overall complication rate was 70 % (grade I, 5; grade II, 1; grade III, 1; grade IV, 0). The median length of hospital stay postsurgery was 7 days (range 6-11). CONCLUSION Robotic surgery allowed for successful anatomic liver resections via an extrahepatic Glissonean pedicle approach in the right liver and can be safely performed in selected patients.","Lee, Jin Ho; Han, Dai Hoon; Jang, Dong-Su; Choi, Gi Hong; Choi, Jin Sub",Surgical endoscopy,100,11

The development of cost-effective and efficient sorbents for the establishment of sensitive analytical methods is critical for achieving trace-level detection. In this study, a graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-based sorbent is synthesized by a facile sonication-assisted method exfoliated by zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) in situ. The novel ZIF-67/g-C3N4 composites were systematically characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and N2 adsorption-desorption analysis, exhibiting good dispersity and a large surface area. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations indicated that g-C3N4 structures can be effectively exfoliated by the introduced ZIF-67 molecules. The hybrid material was successfully utilized as a dispersive solid-phase extraction sorbent, and the extraction factors were systematically optimized by response surface methodology. Under optimal conditions, the synthesized sorbent exhibited desirable linear correlations (R2 > 0.99), a low detection limit (0.3-2 ng L-1), and good repeatability (relative standard deviation <15%, n = 6). The developed method was applied for the analysis of natural and spiked water samples. The study demonstrated that the ZIF-67/g-C3N4 composites are promising materials for pollutant adsorption from drinking water samples.","Xie, Hanyi; Wei, Yanze; Li, Jingkun; Wang, Shanshan; Li, Huijuan; Zhao, Yanfang; Zhao, Mei; Chen, Xiangfeng",Journal of chromatography.

Recent developments in artificial intelligence techniques have provided an innovative alternative to this challenge via the synthesis of biomedical images within a DL framework known as generative adversarial networks (GANs). This paper aims to introduce how GANs can be deployed for image synthesis in ophthalmology and to discuss the potential applications of GANs-produced images. RECENT FINDINGS Image synthesis is the most relevant function of GANs to the medical field, and it has been widely used for generating 'new' medical images of various modalities. In ophthalmology, GANs have mainly been utilized for augmenting classification and predictive tasks, by synthesizing fundus images and Optical coherence tomography images with and without pathologies such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.

Severely infected patients showed abnormal grey matter volumes, white matter diffusion, and cerebral blood flow compared with healthy controls and those with mild infection. The data remain associative rather than mechanistic, but correlations with systemic immune markers suggest effects of inflammation, hypercoagulation, or other aspects of disease severity. Mechanistic research is warranted. Given the lack of obvious neurological symptoms, neurocognitive assessments were not performed, but the findings suggest that such assessments may be warranted in severely affected patients, even without obvious symptoms. Further, studying CNS involvement of other disorders with overlapping pathophysiologies, such as inflammation, coagulation, hypoxia, or direct viral infection may reveal the causes for COVID-19 related neuropathology.","Mahajan, Amit; Mason, Graeme F",The Journal of clinical investigation,100,12

The chemotaxonomic properties of strain CYP1-5T were consistent within the genus Actinomadura. Cell-wall peptidoglycan of this strain contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. Galactose, madurose, and ribose were presented as the diagnostic sugars in whole-cell hydrolysates. The major menaquinone was MK-9(H6). Major cellular fatty acids were iso-C16:0 and C16:0. Phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylinositol mannoside were observed as predominant phospholipids. Based on the results of phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequence, strain CYP1-5T was constituent with the genus Actinomadura and was closely related to Actinomadura syzygii GKU157T (99.5%) and Actinomadura chibensis IFM 10266T (= JCM 14158T) (98.2%). The draft genome size of strain CYP1-5T was 9.30 Mb with 72.2 mol% of G + C content. Strain CYP1-5T showed ANIb values of 94.9% with A. syzygii GKU157T and 93.2% with A. chibensis JCM 14158T. Phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic analysis and genome data support that strain CYP1-5T could be discriminated from its closest relatives, representing a novel species of the genus Actinomadura, for which the name Actinomadura decatromicini sp. nov. is proposed.

This approach has been found to increase success rates of clinical trials and accelerate drug approvals. However, current precision medicine applications in early drug discovery use only a handful of molecular biomarkers to make decisions, whilst clinics gear up to capture the full molecular landscape of patients in the near future. This deep multi-omics characterization demands new analysis strategies to identify appropriate treatment regimens, which we envision will be pioneered by artificial intelligence.Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss the current state of drug discovery in precision medicine and present our vision of how artificial intelligence will impact biomarker discovery and drug design.Expert opinion: Precision medicine is expected to revolutionize modern medicine; however, its traditional form is focusing on a few biomarkers, thus not equipped to leverage the full power of molecular landscapes. For learning how the development of drugs can be tailored to the heterogeneity of patients across their molecular profiles, artificial intelligence algorithms are the next frontier in precision medicine and will enable a fully personalized approach in drug design, and thus ultimately impacting clinical practice.","Boniolo, Fabio; Dorigatti, Emilio; Ohnmacht, Alexander J; Saur, Dieter; Schubert, Benjamin; Menden, Michael P",Expert opinion on drug discovery,100,1

Immunization is an effective way to prevent many diseases, saving two to three million lives per year. The Nepal National Government recommends vaccinations for all children for 11 diseases by 15 months of age. However, only 78% of children between 1-2 years of age have received all recommended vaccines and only 43% receive them at the age-appropriate times for which they are scheduled. Objectives: This protocol describes the development of an intervention - called ""Rejoice Architecture"" - that is informed by three theoretical perspectives: choice architecture, the broken windows theory, and the theory of normative social behavior. We also describe a mixed-methods approach to develop the intervention, which will improve the physical and social environments of health facilities in Makwanpur, Nepal. We hypothesize this intervention will improve immunization behaviors and intentions among mothers of children younger than 2 years, pregnant women, and prospective mothers. Methods: We describe the qualitative formative assessment to understand existing attitudes, norms, and behaviors among caregivers, healthcare workers, and government representatives. The formative assessment will include in-depth interviews, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions. We also describe the overall quasi-experimental study design, used to assess intervention impact. Impact: This study will contribute to the social and behavioral change communication intervention research by offering a novel strategy for increasing immunization. This study will also illustrate to policymakers the value of structural change for health service delivery.","Paul, Alicia; Upreti, Kamana; Nepal, Shraddha; Lohani, Jeevan; Adhikari, Kriti; Rimal, Rajiv",Gates open research,100,1

It is assumed that the noisy and stressful ICU environment leads to sensory overload and deprivation and potentially to long-term cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE In this study, we investigated three different virtual reality environments and their potentially restorative and relaxing effects for reducing sensory overload and deprivation in the ICU. METHODS A total of 45 healthy subjects were exposed to three different environments, each 10 minutes in length (dynamic, virtual, natural, and urban environments presented inside the head-mounted display, and a neutral video on an ICU TV screen). During the study, data was collected by validated questionnaires (ie, restoration and sickness) and sensors to record physiological parameters (240 hertz). RESULTS The results showed that the natural environment had the highest positive and restorative effect on the physiological and psychological state of healthy subjects, followed by the urban environment and the ICU TV screen. CONCLUSIONS Overall, virtual reality stimulation with head-mounted display using a dynamic, virtual and natural environment has the potential, if directly used in the ICU, to reduce sensory overload and deprivation in critically ill patients and thus to prevent neurocognitive late effects.","Gerber, Stephan M; Jeitziner, Marie-Madlen; Sänger, Simon D; Knobel, Samuel E J; Marchal-Crespo, Laura; Müri, René M; Schefold, Joerg C; Jakob, Stephan M; Nef, Tobias",JMIR perioperative medicine,100,17

A sensitive sensor was developed based on copper BTC metal-organic framework (Cu-BTC MOF) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride as an ionic liquid (IL) in an attempt to modify the carbon paste electrode and to improve the active surface area and electric conductivity so that electron transfer is faster for electro analysis. For the first time, high sensitivity, excellent conductivity, and appropriate selectivity of the electrochemical sensor have been evaluated as a new study for simultaneous determination of tartrazine, patent blue V, acid violet 7 and ponceau 4R. Excellent sensing performance of the proposed electrode was confirmed for patent blue V as an outstanding sensor, according to the low limit of detection of 0.07 µM, with a wide linear concentration range of 0.08 to 900 µM and reasonable recovery. In order to characterize the electrochemical behavior of electrode, cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are used. Various techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-Ray analysis (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) are employed to verify the structure of copper BTC metal-organic framework. The results revealed close packing of hierarchically porous nanoparticles and crystal structure of Cu-BTC MOF, with the edge of each particle around 20-37 nm. The analytical performance of the suggested electrochemical sensor is acceptable in foodstuffs such as jellies, condiments, soft drinks, and candies.","Darabi, Rozhin; Shabani-Nooshabadi, Mehdi; Karimi-Maleh, Hassan; Gholami, Ali",Food chemistry,100,1

We hypothesized that missense variants in GWAS and related candidate genes may underlie cases of extreme obesity and NAFLD-related cirrhosis, an extreme manifestation of NAFLD. METHODS We performed whole-exome sequencing on 6 Caucasian patients with extreme obesity [mean body mass index (BMI) 84.4] and 4 obese Caucasian patients (mean BMI 57.0) with NAFLD-related cirrhosis. RESULTS Sequence analysis was performed on 24 replicated GWAS and selected candidate obesity genes and 5 loci associated with NAFLD. No missense variants were identified in 19 of the 29 genes analyzed, although all patients carried at least 2 missense variants in the remaining genes without excess homozygosity. One patient with extreme obesity carried 2 novel damaging mutations in BBS1 and was homozygous for benign and damaging MC3R variants. In addition, 1 patient with NAFLD-related cirrhosis was compound heterozygous for rare damaging mutations in PNPLA3. CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that analyzing candidate loci previously identified by GWAS analyses using whole-exome sequencing is an effective strategy to identify potentially causative missense variants underlying extreme obesity and NAFLD-related cirrhosis.","Gerhard, Glenn S; Chu, Xin; Wood, G Craig; Gerhard, Genevieve M; Benotti, Peter; Petrick, Anthony T; Gabrielsen, Jon; Strodel, William E; Still, Christopher D; Argyropoulos, George",Human heredity,100,31

Recent research and guideline updates have advanced our understanding and management of ColdU. Today, its pathophysiology is thought to involve the cold-induced formation of autoallergens and IgE to these autoallergens, which provoke a release of proinflammatory mediators from skin mast cells. The classification of ColdU includes typical and atypical subtypes. We know that cold-induced wheals usually develop on rewarming and resolve within an hour and that anaphylaxis can occur. The diagnosis relies on the patient's history and cold stimulation testing. Additional diagnostic work-up, including a search for underlying infections, should only be done if indicated by the patient's history. The management of ColdU includes cold avoidance, the regular use of nonsedating antihistamines, and the off-label use of omalizumab. However, many questions regarding ColdU remain unanswered.

Phytophthora sojae is the causative agent for Phytophthora root and stem rot in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and can be managed by deployment of resistance to P. sojae (Rps) genes. PI 340,029 is a soybean landrace carrying broad-spectrum resistance to the pathogen. Analysis of an F2 population derived from a cross between PI 340,029 and a susceptible cultivar 'Williams' reveals that the resistance to P. sojae race 1 is conferred by a single gene, designated Rps14, which was initially mapped to a 4.5-cM region on the short arm of chromosome 3 by bulked segregant analysis (BSA), and subsequently narrowed to a 1.48 cM region corresponding to 229-kb in the Williams 82 reference genome (Wm82 v2.a1), using F3:4 families derived from the F2 population. Further analysis indicates that the broad-spectrum resistance carried by PI 340,029 is fully attributable to Rps14. The genomic sequences corresponding to the defined Rps14 region from a set of diverse soybean varieties exhibit drastic NBS-LRR gene copy number variation, ranging from 3 to 17 copies. Ultimate isolation of Rps14 would be critical for precise selection and deployment of the gene for soybean protection.","Chen, Liyang; Wang, Weidong; Ping, Jieqing; Fitzgerald, Joshua C; Cai, Guohong; Clark, Chancelor B; Aggarwal, Rajat; Ma, Jianxin",TAG.

Currently available stent delivery systems make deployment in many locations in the GI tract difficult due to the inability to traverse curves or impossible due to the size requirements of the deployment systems. METHODS A 67-year-old male presented to our hospital with severe gallstone pancreatitis, requiring a prolonged intensive care unit course. Two days after discharge to a rehabilitation facility he developed acute abdominal pain and pneumoperitoneum. Operative exploration failed to identify a perforation. Subsequently, a left-upper-quadrant abscess developed that was drained percutaneously, yielding coliform bacteria. The drain produced several hundred milliliters of stool a day. A barium enema demonstrated a perforation in the descending colon from an old colo-colic anastomosis site. We proposed a novel over-the-scope (OTS) stent deployment method. Utilizing a heat-activated polymer sheath, the stent was affixed to the endoscope. A modified speed-banding attachment was created to permit release of the polymer sheath once endoscopic and fluoroscopic confirmation of the correct position was obtained. RESULTS Utilizing this method of OTS stent deployment, a fully covered 23 × 155 mm self-expanding metal stent (WallFlex, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) was placed in the colon. Endoscopic and fluoroscopic evaluation following stent placement confirmed stent coverage of the perforation with no ongoing evidence of leak. The patient was discharged to his home state 2 weeks after stent placement in stable condition. CONCLUSION We have developed a novel method of OTS stent placement that permits deployment of a variety of enteral stents on any available endoscope. This method permits placement of fully covered stents in locations in the GI tract not reachable with currently available delivery systems.","Pauli, Eric M; Schomisch, Steve J; Blatnik, Jeffrey A; Krpata, David M; Sanabria, Juan S; Marks, Jeffrey M",Surgical endoscopy,100,12

Reverse genetics systems are a valuable tool to study viral replication and pathogenesis, design attenuated vaccines and create defined viral assay systems for applications such as antiviral screening. Here we present a novel reverse genetics system for MERS-CoV that involves maintenance of the full-length viral genome as a cDNA copy inserted in a bacterial artificial chromosome amenable to manipulation by homologue recombination, based on the bacteriophage λ Red recombination system. Based on a full-length infectious MERS-CoV cDNA clone, optimal genomic insertion sites and expression strategies for GFP were identified and used to generate a reporter MERS-CoV expressing GFP in addition to the complete set of viral proteins. GFP was genetically fused to the N-terminal part of protein 4a, from which it is released during translation via porcine teschovirus 2A peptide activity. The resulting reporter virus achieved titres nearly identical to the wild-type virus 48 h after infection of Vero cells at m.o.i. 0.001 (1×105 p.f.u. ml-1 and 3×105 p.f.u. ml-1, respectively), and allowed determination of the 50 % inhibitory concentration for the known MERS-CoV inhibitor cyclosporine A based on fluorescence readout. The resulting value was 2.41 µM, which corresponds to values based on wild-type virus. The reverse genetics system described herein can be efficiently mutated by Red-mediated recombination. The GFP-expressing reporter virus contains the full set of MERS-CoV proteins and achieves wild-type titres in cell culture.","Muth, Doreen; Meyer, Benjamin; Niemeyer, Daniela; Schroeder, Simon; Osterrieder, Nikolaus; Müller, Marcel Alexander; Drosten, Christian",The Journal of general virology,100,7

Isotopic labeling studies revealed that both the H- and CO2 originate from the bound μ1,3-formate in 1H, which represents a key step of the metal-mediated formic acid dehydrogenation. The full reaction equation for the conversion of 1H to 2H is established. The structure of 2H features two Cu3 triangles, each capped by a hydride ligand.

Semistructured dyadic interviews were conducted with 12 patients (65.1 ± 12.8 years old; eight males) undergoing in-center hemodialysis for 18.6 (±13.3) months and their spouses (60.3 ± 11.2 years old; seven females). The interviews were digitally audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and submitted to thematic analysis by two independent researchers. FINDINGS The findings from the dyadic perspective were conceptualized into two major themes: negative impacts (emotional distress, constraints on leisure and daily activities, impacts on couples' dynamics, and difficulties in meal planning) and unmet needs (educational, relational, financial, instrumental, and supportive needs). DISCUSSION The findings suggested that ESRD has several negative impacts that are related to the reported unmet needs, which might difficult couples' psychosocial adjustment to the condition. Both partners may benefit from educational and supportive interventions that address their needs, targeting the couple as a unit. Recognizing ESRD as a family condition is crucial for the development of innovative family-based interventions that can promote couples' healthy adjustment to the disease.","Sousa, Helena; Ribeiro, Oscar; Figueiredo, Daniela",Hemodialysis international.

Responding to medical emergencies in patients with suspected COVID-19 will require new guidelines and protocols. Simulation can support their development. METHODS We organised seven simulations involving patients with suspected COVID-19 for staff at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals. Participants completed pre- and post-simulation questionnaires. RESULTS Fifty-six staff participated and they reported being significantly less prepared to respond to an emergency in a patient with suspected COVID-19 than in one in whom it is not suspected. The simulations significantly improved the participants' confidence in responding to emergencies in patients with suspected COVID-19. Numerous challenges were identified along the themes of equipment, personnel, communication and procedures. CONCLUSIONS Low-fidelity simulation can provide relevant and timely information on how prepared health systems and their workforce are to respond to emergencies. We urge NHS trusts nationally to implement simulations to identify problems and develop effective solutions.","Wenlock, Rhys D; Arnold, Amy; Patel, Hiten; Kirtchuk, David",Clinical medicine,100,31

Meanwhile, few studies focused on the mid-term sequelae, which still remain largely unknown. AIM To assess the physical performance of COVID-19 survivors at 3 to 6 months from Hospital discharge. DESIGN A cross-sectional study focused on mid-term functional outcomes evaluation in COVID-19 survivors. SETTING Outpatients who had been previously hospitalized due to COVID-19 from March to May 2020 at the University Hospital of Novara (Italy). POPULATION We enrolled 204 patients, of which 60% were men, with the mean age of 57.9 years. METHODS Patients firstly underwent the Short Physical Performance Battery test (SPPB), which is composed of a series of physical tests assessing the lower limb function and the functional status of the subjects. Subsequently, based on SPPB results, patients' cardiorespiratory fitness performance was further investigated. Patients with normal SPPB score (SPPB > 10) underwent the 2-Minute Walking test (2MWT) whereas, in order to safely test the cardiorespiratory function, in patients with abnormal SPPB score (SPPB ≤ 10) the 1-Minute-Sit-to-Stand Test (1MSTST) was performed. It should be noted that the 1MSTST can be safely performed even by subjects with compromised walking ability. RESULTS Overall, 66 patients (32% of our sample) showed an impaired physical performance at 3 to 6 months after hospital discharge. In particular, 29 patients presented an SPPB score ≤ 10, and the 1MSTST confirmed this status in the whole group (100%) compared to the reference values for age and sex. Besides, among patients with a normal SPPB score, 37 showed a lower sex- and age-matched 2MWT score. Finally, a significant association between Intensive Care Unit hospitalization or mechanical ventilation and physical impairment was observed together with a significant association between the walking ability (measured with SPPB and 2MWT) and the number of comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS A residual physical and functional impairment was observed in COVID-19 survivors at mid-term evaluation after hospitalization. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT Considering the current COVID-19 epidemiology, we might expect a tremendous burden of disability in the next future. Thus, an appropriate clinical rehabilitation pathway must be implemented.","Baricich, Alessio; Borg, Margherita B; Cuneo, Daria; Cadario, Emanuela; Azzolina, Danila; Balbo, Piero E; Bellan, Mattia; Zeppegno, Patrizia; Pirisi, Mario; Cisari, Carlo",European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,100,31

The human and material resources available in a mid-size hospital were more limited than in larger hospitals of the region. In this article, we describe how this Department of Hospital Pharmacy was reorganized to meet the increase in activity, the strategies developed and the lessons learned for future pandemics. The COVID-19 pandemic had a higher impact in Leganes, a city in the south of Madrid, with a population of 190,000. In the face of the dramatic increase in the proportion of patients attending our hospital between March and April 2020, the Severo Ochoa University Hospital increased the number of beds by 24.5% and fitted out new premises inside and outside the hospital (sports centers). The mean number of patients seen in our Emergency Department every day passed from 70-80 to a peak of 286 patients, with 652 hospitalized patients. The situation of emergency created by this infectious disease, with management protocols changing constantly, had a dramatic impact on the activity of hospital pharmacies. Thus, the pandemic has affected areas of economic management, magistral preparation, dispensing of medication to inpatients, ambulatory patients, patients monitored at home, institutionalized patients, and patients from private hospitals and field hospitals. Other areas affected include training, clinical trials, pharmacovigilance, and counseling boards. Two strategies were adopted to overcome these problems: a strategy centered on human resources (staff reinforcement, reallocation of responsibilities), and a strategy centered on processes (some processes were reinforced to meet the increase in activity, whereas other were temporarily suspended or reduced to the minimum).Conclusions: The Department of Hospital Pharmacy plays a key role in hospitals and has been significantly reinforced to meet the dramatic impact of the pandemic on this service. This Department has been able to reorganize its processes and take over new responsibilities such as telepharmacy and home dispensing. Hospital pharmacies play a crucial role in pharmacotherapeutic decisions in hospitals. As in other Departments, training is the area more significantly affected by the pandemic.","Corregidor-Luna, Laura; Hidalgo-Correas, Francisco J; García-Díaz, Benito",Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,100,1

Flow cytometry was used to measure inflammatory cell numbers. Clodronate liposomes were used to deplete resident macrophages. RT-PCR, and ELISA was used to measure MIP-2, MCP-1, TNF-α and MMP9 levels. In vitro, sorted neutrophils, resident and recruited macrophages (1 × 106 ) were cultured with 1 μg/mL LPS and/or 100 nmol/L PDX to assess the chemokine receptor expression. PDX attenuated LPS-induced lung injury via inhibiting recruited macrophage and neutrophil recruitment through repressing resident macrophage MCP-1, MIP-2 expression and release, respectively. Finally, PDX inhibition of neutrophil infiltration and transmembrane was associated with TNF-α/MIP-2/MMP9 signalling pathway.

However, the potential cross-reactivity among porcine coronaviruses is a major concern for the development of pathogen-specific assays. In this study, we used serum samples (n = 792) from pigs of precisely known infection status and a multiplex fluorescent microbead-based immunoassay and/or enzyme-linked immunoassay platform to characterize the antibody response to PEDV whole-virus (WV) particles and recombinant polypeptides derived from the four PEDV structural proteins, i.e., spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E). Antibody assay cutoff values were selected to provide 100% diagnostic specificity for each target. The earliest IgG antibody response, mainly directed against S1 polypeptides, was observed at days 7 to 10 postinfection. With the exception of nonreactive protein E, we observed similar antibody ontogenies and patterns of seroconversion for S1, N, M, and WV antigens. Recombinant S1 provided the best diagnostic sensitivity, regardless of the PEDV strain, with no cross-reactivity detected against transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), or porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) pig antisera. The WV particles showed some cross-reactivity to TGEV Miller and TGEV Purdue antisera, while N protein presented some cross-reactivity to TGEV Miller. The M protein was highly cross-reactive to TGEV and PRCV antisera. Differences in the antibody responses to specific PEDV structural proteins have important implications in the development and performance of antibody assays for the diagnosis of PEDV enteric disease.","Gimenez-Lirola, Luis Gabriel; Zhang, Jianqiang; Carrillo-Avila, Jose Antonio; Chen, Qi; Magtoto, Ronaldo; Poonsuk, Korakrit; Baum, David H; Piñeyro, Pablo; Zimmerman, Jeffrey",Journal of clinical microbiology,100,13

However, a general and stereoselective method towards the rapid construction of this structure remains challenging due to the inherent instability and complex stereochemistry of polyketide. By mimicking the biosynthetic pathway of this structurally diverse set of natural products, we herein develop an asymmetric hetero-Diels-Alder reaction of in-situ generated isochromene and ortho-quinonemethide. A broad range of tetracyclic isochroman frameworks are prepared in good yields and excellent stereoinduction (up to 95% ee) from readily available α-propargyl benzyl alcohols and 2-(hydroxylmethyl) phenols under mild conditions. This direct enantioselective cascade reaction is achieved by a Au(I)/chiral Sc(III) bimetallic catalytic system. Experimental studies indicate that the key hetero-Diels-Alder reaction involves a stepwise pathway, and the steric hindrance between in-situ generated isochromene and t-Bu group of Sc(III)/N,N'-dioxide complex is responsible for the enantioselectivity in the hetero-Diels-Alder reaction step.","Lin, Xiangfeng; Liu, Xianghui; Wang, Kai; Li, Qian; Liu, Yan; Li, Can",Nature communications,100,1

The safety of methadone has been called into question by data indicating a large increase in the number of methadone-associated overdose deaths in recent years that has occurred in parallel with a dramatic rise in the use of methadone for chronic pain. The American Pain Society and the College on Problems of Drug Dependence, in collaboration with the Heart Rhythm Society, commissioned an interdisciplinary expert panel to develop a clinical practice guideline on safer prescribing of methadone for treatment of opioid addiction and chronic pain. As part of the guideline development process, the American Pain Society commissioned a systematic review of various aspects related to safety of methadone. After a review of the available evidence, the expert panel concluded that measures can be taken to promote safer use of methadone. Specific recommendations include the need to educate and counsel patients on methadone safety, use of electrocardiography to identify persons at greater risk for methadone-associated arrhythmia, use of alternative opioids in patients at high risk of complications related to corrected electrocardiographic QTc interval prolongation, careful dose initiation and titration of methadone, and diligent monitoring and follow-up. Although these guidelines are based on a systematic review, the panel identified numerous research gaps, most recommendations were based on low-quality evidence, and no recommendations were based on high-quality evidence. PERSPECTIVE This guideline, based on a systematic review of the evidence on methadone safety, provides recommendations developed by a multidisciplinary expert panel. Safe use of methadone requires clinical skills and knowledge in use of methadone to mitigate potential risks, including serious risks related to risk of overdose and cardiac arrhythmias.","Chou, Roger; Cruciani, Ricardo A; Fiellin, David A; Compton, Peggy; Farrar, John T; Haigney, Mark C; Inturrisi, Charles; Knight, John R; Otis-Green, Shirley; Marcus, Steven M; Mehta, Davendra; Meyer, Marjorie C; Portenoy, Russell; Savage, Seddon; Strain, Eric; Walsh, Sharon; Zeltzer, Lonnie",The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society,100,1

Previous work showed that 8% of patients develop new onset AF following colonic resection, and highlighted factors that might predict the development of postoperative AF. The development of a new arrhythmia may have a negative effect on longer term quality of life, as well as cancer survivorship. The aim of this study is to accurately quantify the incidence of AF following colorectal cancer surgery and to validate a model to predict its development. METHODS The AFAR study will recruit 720 patients aged 65 or over undergoing colorectal cancer resection with curative intent. The primary outcome is development of AF within 90 days of surgery. Assessment of cardiac rhythm will be performed using 24-hour ""Holter"" monitors at baseline, 30, and 90 days post surgery. An ECG will be performed on the day of discharge. Baseline descriptors including model variables and quality of life will be recorded using EQ-5D-5L. The occurrence of complications and other key surgical outcomes will be recorded. An additional blood test for N Terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) will be performed prior to surgery. Statistical analysis will validate a previously derived model and will test the incremental value of added variables such as NT-proBNP. Finally, an exploratory analysis will assess whether changes in ECG measures between baseline and post-operative ECG can predict subsequent new onset AF. DISCUSSION This study will provide data that may allow us to stratify the risk of developing AF following colorectal cancer surgery.

This review synthesizes the available data and provides a framework for optimal management of stroke patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection and eligible to reperfusion treatments. RECENT FINDINGS Reorganization of health services has led to the conversion of stroke units and relocation of stroke staff to COVID units. During the pandemic surge, there has been a general decline of stroke presentations, increased time delays, and reduced activity across all areas of stroke care, specifically the delivery of acute treatment. Moreover, COVID-19 patients seem to have a worse outcome despite prompt recanalization. Periprocedural monitoring studies are needed in these patients to target a more adequate therapy. SUMMARY The COVID-19 pandemic has jeopardized the ability of stroke centers to provide timely assessment and acute therapies such as reperfusive treatments. Yet, as stroke remains a medical emergency, efforts to maintain stroke teams and safe provision of highly effective stroke treatments should be prioritized despite healthcare systems reorganization. This can be accomplished through the activation of telestroke networks, protected stroke pathways, 24/7 open-access high-quality stroke centers, and stroke awareness programs.","Baracchini, Claudio; Pieroni, Alessio",Current opinion in neurology,100,1

We aimed to compare the effect of these two devices in patients who had undergone total thyroidectomy, by highlighting the post-operative parathyroid function. A total of 201 consecutive patients for whom total thyroidectomy had been planned were prospectively classified into two groups. There were 104 patients in LP group and 97 patients in HS group. Hypoparathyroidism was followed up by serially measuring the levels of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and serum calcium. The early iPTH level was 29 (8-50) pg/mL in group LP, and 17 (4-43) pg/mL in group HS. The early iPTH level was significantly lower in the HS group (p < 0.001). However, these levels were within the reference interval in both groups. The early iPTH level was lower than 20 pg/mL in 23 (23.1 %) patients in HS group, and 15 (13.7 %) patients in LP group (p < 0.001). Also, the late iPTH levels were not statistically significance between two groups. The early and late serum calcium levels were not statistically significant between groups. However, the amount of calcium replacement was higher in the HS group than the LP group and the duration of treatment was longer in the HS group than the LP group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, although parathyroid hormone levels impaired in the HS group more than LP group in the early period, these levels were in the normal limits in both groups. These levels were not significant between groups in the long time period.","Ciftci, Fatih; Sakalli, Erdal; Abdurrahman, Ibrahim; Guler, Burak",European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,100,1

The patients attended day care or primary schools; the specimens were randomly obtained by pediatricians from schools and childcare institutions and sent for identification by PCR method. A total of 300 specimens were collected. From all samples, 40.67% were positive for at least 1 virus, viz. adenovirus 11.76%, rhinovirus 9.8%, respiratory syncytial virus 6.08%, influenza virus 5.56%, parainfluenza virus 4.9%, enterovirus 2.94% and a combination of 2 viruses 2%.

Currently, it has affected more than 2,850,000 people. No vaccine or drug is available yet, and therefore researchers and scientists are striving to identify potential drugs or vaccines for combating this virus. We were unable to find any review of the literature or analysis on ongoing registered clinical trials that reported diagnostic tests, therapeutics, vaccines and devices for COVID-19 along with estimated enrollment, participants' ages, study type, start and completion date, status, treatment/intervention and country. OBJECTIVE To review ongoing trials relating to COVID-19. METHODS A systematic search for clinical trials was conducted in the ClinicalTrials.gov database up to April 12, 2020. A total of 339 trials relating to COVID-19 were analyzed and key information on each trial was recorded. RESULTS Most of the trials were being conducted in the United States and completion of most of them was expected by May 2020. They were mostly on drugs and treatment, while a minority were on diagnostic tests. The analysis showed that hydroxychloroquine was investigated in most of the trials. The trials identified were categorized into five classes: a) diagnostic tests; b) therapeutics; c) biologics and vaccines; d) devices and products; and e) others. CONCLUSION The trials identified have potential against COVID-19 that can be applied in treatment processes after the necessary investigations and experiments. Additionally, the items identified were organized in a proper way, which can assist in current research activities.","Rabby, Md Insiat Islam; Hossain, Farzad",Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,100,31

The aim was to assess the quality of sleep (QoS) and fatigue in patients with the relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS The study included 67 patients with RRMS and 85 healthy control subjects. RRMS patients, who were tested in first half of 2019, were retested in April and May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected sociodemographic and clinical data, and also used the following questionnaires: Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 Instrument (MSQOL-54). RESULTS The FSS score and PSQI global score were significantly higher in patients with RRMS than in the control group (p < 0.01). We noticed a statistically significant difference between the results obtained a year ago and the results during the COVID-19 pandemic in PSQI global score (p < 0.01) and all subscores. Higher disability status was an independent predictor of the worse PSQI scores. CONCLUSION During the COVID-19 outbreak worse QoS were noticed in RRMS patients than in healthy individuals. Also, QoS of RRMS patients is more affected during the COVID-19 pandemic than in regular circumstances. High levels of sleep disturbance and fatigue in RRMS patients correlates with worse life quality, female gender, lower educational level and partner status. The results of the present study provide evidence in support of regular screening and monitoring of fatigue and QoS in this patient population, especially during the pandemic states.","Stojanov, Aleksandar; Vojinovic, Slobodan; Stojanov, Jelena; Malobabic, Marina; Stevic, Milos; Milosevic, Vuk; Stanojevic, Goran",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,100,1

In patients who experience variations in the activity of this enzyme (e.g., CYP2D6 poor and ultrarapid metabolizers [PMs and UMs]), whether caused by genetic polymorphisms or concomitant administration of a CYP2D6 inhibitor (i.e., phenoconversion), the pharmacokinetics, and hence the effects, of CYP2D6 substrate antidepressants can be altered. METHODS This literature review describes the clinical and empirical evidence indicating that alterations in CYP2D6 activity can negatively affect treatment outcomes in patients receiving antidepressant pharmacotherapies that are CYP2D6 substrates. RESULTS Based on results from a small, prospective trial, a population analysis, and a pooled analysis, CYP2D6 PMs treated with agents dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism to form an active metabolite can experience a decline in antidepressant effect. Based on a population analysis and two case studies, CYP2D6 UMs treated with antidepressants that are CYP2D6 substrates and administered in a pharmacologically active form do not experience an antidepressant effect due to the agent being too rapidly eliminated from the body. Conversely, based on prospective trials, population analyses, and case studies, phenotypic and phenoconverted CYP2D6 PMs can experience an increase in concentration-dependent adverse events due to the agent being eliminated too slowly from the body. CONCLUSIONS Despite these examples, few large-scale, prospective trials exploring the effect of altered CYP2D6 metabolism on antidepressant outcomes have been conducted. Future clinical trials of CYP2D6-dependent antidepressants should be designed to allow for stratification of treatment outcomes by CYP2D6 metabolizer status.","D'Empaire, Inna; Guico-Pabia, Christine J; Preskorn, Sheldon H",Journal of psychiatric practice,100,1

These leaks can be difficult to manage given the limited field of view and lack of deep access. Herein, we describe 8 consecutive patients who underwent intraoperative repair of CSF leak, with no postoperative evidence of wound dehiscence or drainage. METHODS A retrospective review was performed on 8 cases where CSF leak was encountered during an anterior cervical spine surgery. Patients had ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, intradural disk herniation, or dural ectasia. Intraoperative repair was as follows. First, CSF was drained to low pressure, and durotomy was covered by dural substitute and sealant agent. Then the interbody graft used was manually undersized in the anteroposterior dimension to allow for expansion of the agents used. Anterior instrumentation was then performed. Finally, a wound drain was anchored to a biologic bag for shoulder level passive drainage. RESULTS In all 8 cases, there were no cases of wound dehiscence or CSF leak using this strategy. Likewise, there was no evidence of cord compression or neurologic deficits. No meningitis or persistent headaches were reported, and there was no need for lumbar drain placement at any time postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS Once durotomy is encountered during anterior spine surgery, draining the CSF to a low pressure followed by dural substitute with a sealing agent, followed by a smaller anteroposterior size graft is an effective strategy of preventing complications in an inescapable problem.","Mitchell, Bartley D; Verla, Terence; Reddy, Duemani; Winnegan, Lona; Omeis, Ibrahim",World neurosurgery,100,27

However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we explore whether activated microglia aggravate white matter injury via complement C3-C3aR pathway after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 80) underwent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion for 7, 14, and 28 days. Cerebral vessel density and blood flow were examined by synchrotron radiation angiography and three-dimensional arterial spin labeling. Neurobehavioral assessments, CLARITY imaging, and immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate activation of microglia and C3-C3aR pathway. Furthermore, C3aR knockout mice were used to establish the causal relationship of C3-C3aR signaling on microglia activation and white matter injury after hypoperfusion. Results: Cerebral vessel density and blood flow were reduced after hypoperfusion (p<0.05). Spatial learning and memory deficits and white matter injury were shown (p<0.05). These impairments were correlated with aberrant microglia activation and an increase in the number of reactive microglia adhering to and phagocytosed myelin in the hypoperfusion group (p<0.05), which were accompanied by the up-regulation of complement C3 and its receptors C3aR (p<0.05). Genetic deletion of C3ar1 significantly inhibited aberrant microglial activation and reversed white matter injury after hypoperfusion (p<0.05). Furthermore, the C3aR antagonist SB290157 decreased the number of microglia adhering to myelin (p<0.05), attenuated white matter injury and cognitive deficits in chronic hypoperfusion rats (p<0.05). Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that aberrant activated microglia aggravate white matter injury via C3-C3aR pathway during chronic hypoperfusion. These findings indicate C3aR plays a critical role in mediating neuroinflammation and white matter injury through aberrant microglia activation, which provides a novel therapeutic target for the small vessel disease and vascular dementia.","Zhang, Lin-Yuan; Pan, Jiaji; Mamtilahun, Muyassar; Zhu, Yuan; Wang, Liping; Venkatesh, Ashwin; Shi, Rubing; Tu, Xuanqiang; Jin, Kunlin; Wang, Yongting; Zhang, Zhijun; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Theranostics,100,16

Comprehensive data comparing type I and type II inhibitors are currently lacking for NTRK fusion-driven cancers. Here we used a type II NTRK inhibitor, altiratinib, as a model compound to investigate its inhibitory potential for larotrectinib (type I inhibitor)-resistant mutations in NTRK. Our study shows that a subset of larotrectinib-resistant NTRK1 mutations (V573M, F589L and G667C) retains sensitivity to altiratinib, while the NTRK1V573M and xDFG motif NTRK1G667C mutations are highly sensitive to type II inhibitors, including altiratinib, cabozantinib and foretinib. Moreover, molecular modeling suggests that the introduction of a sulfur moiety in the binding pocket, via methionine or cysteine substitutions, specifically renders the mutant kinase hypersensitive to type II inhibitors.

The oldest old mortality rates in Hong Kong were observed to have a likelihood of being associated with these environmental stressors. Furthermore, men appeared to be more susceptible to these risk factors than did women. More care and attention should be given to the oldest old men, in particular, during periods of socioeconomic or political upheavals.

We investigated whether patients with cryptogenic stroke and echocardiographic features representing risk of stroke would benefit from PFO closure or anticoagulation, as compared with antiplatelet therapy. METHODS In a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, we assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, patients 16 to 60 years of age who had had a recent stroke attributed to PFO, with an associated atrial septal aneurysm or large interatrial shunt, to transcatheter PFO closure plus long-term antiplatelet therapy (PFO closure group), antiplatelet therapy alone (antiplatelet-only group), or oral anticoagulation (anticoagulation group) (randomization group 1). Patients with contraindications to anticoagulants or to PFO closure were randomly assigned to the alternative noncontraindicated treatment or to antiplatelet therapy (randomization groups 2 and 3). The primary outcome was occurrence of stroke. The comparison of PFO closure plus antiplatelet therapy with antiplatelet therapy alone was performed with combined data from randomization groups 1 and 2, and the comparison of oral anticoagulation with antiplatelet therapy alone was performed with combined data from randomization groups 1 and 3. RESULTS A total of 663 patients underwent randomization and were followed for a mean (±SD) of 5.3±2.0 years. In the analysis of randomization groups 1 and 2, no stroke occurred among the 238 patients in the PFO closure group, whereas stroke occurred in 14 of the 235 patients in the antiplatelet-only group (hazard ratio, 0.03; 95% confidence interval, 0 to 0.26; P<0.001). Procedural complications from PFO closure occurred in 14 patients (5.9%). The rate of atrial fibrillation was higher in the PFO closure group than in the antiplatelet-only group (4.6% vs. 0.9%, P=0.02). The number of serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the treatment groups (P=0.56). In the analysis of randomization groups 1 and 3, stroke occurred in 3 of 187 patients assigned to oral anticoagulants and in 7 of 174 patients assigned to antiplatelet therapy alone. CONCLUSIONS Among patients who had had a recent cryptogenic stroke attributed to PFO with an associated atrial septal aneurysm or large interatrial shunt, the rate of stroke recurrence was lower among those assigned to PFO closure combined with antiplatelet therapy than among those assigned to antiplatelet therapy alone.

Largely because of a more disciplined and scientific approach to fat grafting as a transplantation event, early adopters of fat transplantation have begun to approach fat grafting as a process, using sound surgical transplantation principles: recipient preparation, controlled donor harvest, time-efficient transplantation, and proper postoperative care. Despite these principles, different fat grafting techniques yield impressive clinical outcomes. METHODS The essential variables of four types of fat grafting cases were identified and compared: harvesting, methods of cell processing, methods of transplantation, and management of the recipient site. RESULTS Each case differed for most of the variables analyzed. The two clinical drivers that most impacted these differences were the volume demands of the recipient site and whether the recipient site was healthy tissue or pathologic tissue. After these two drivers, a matrix classification of small-volume versus large-volume and regenerative versus nonregenerative cases yields four distinct categories. CONCLUSIONS Not all fat grafting is the same. Fat grafting, once thought to be a simple technique with variable results, is a much more complex procedure with at least four definable subtypes. By defining the essential differences in the recipient site, the key driver in fat transplantation, the proper selection of technique can be best chosen. In fat transplantation, different problems require different solutions.","Del Vecchio, Daniel; Rohrich, Rod J",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,100,29

METHODS Retrospective analysis of consecutive stroke patients with: (1) MCA-M1 occlusion; (2) MRI performed ≤10 h from symptoms onset; and (3) baseline MRI-diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) volume ≤25 mL. Definitions included: CDM=baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ≥8 and DWI volume ≤25 mL; MTT-DWI mismatch=visually assessed unthresholded MTT lesion ((MTT-DWI))/DWI) ≥20% and ≥10 mL larger than the DWI lesion; and significant infarct growth (>20% (≥5 mL) increase in infarct volume on follow-up). Uni-/multivariate analyses were performed to define the predictors of infarct growth. RESULTS 63 stroke patients with MCA-M1 occlusions and MRI within 10 h of onset were evaluated. 20 patients were excluded on the basis of DWI volume >25 mL leaving 43 patients (mean age 75.8 years; median NIHSS=13) in the study cohort. On univariate analysis, larger admission DWI volume (p<0.0001), baseline NIHSS score ≥8 (p=0.001), lack of IV and/or endovascular treatment (p=0.021), glucose levels >125 mg/dL (p=0.024), poor CT angiography collaterals (p=0.046), and lower admission Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score (ASPECTS) (p=0.049) predicted infarct growth. Baseline NIHSS score ≥8 was the only independent predictor of stroke growth in the multivariate analysis (p=0.001). All patients had MTT-DWI mismatch >20%. There was no significant association between the amount of MTT-DWI mismatch and infarct growth (p=0.33). CONCLUSIONS CDM is the most powerful predictor of infarct growth in patients with MCA-M1 occlusion and small infarct core.

METHODS The data of all patients with community- and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia caused by E coli were collected from the hospital charts at the HELIOS Clinic, Witten/Herdecke University, Wuppertal, Germany, within the study period 2004 to 2014. An antibiogram was performed for the study patients with pneumonia caused by E coli. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for the different antibiotics that have been consistently used in the treatment of patients with pneumonia caused by E coli. All demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of all of the patients with pneumonia caused by E coli were collected from the patients' records. RESULTS During the study period of January 1, 2004 to August 12, 2014, 135 patients were identified with community- and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia affected by E coli.

Corticosteroids are associated with a length-of-treatment and dose-dependent risk for infection. Screening and antimicrobial prophylaxis against tuberculosis, hepatitis B, Strongyloides stercoralis, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) might be indicated in patients who are scheduled to be on high-dose corticosteroids for >4 weeks (>30 mg of prednisone-equivalent dose [PEQ]) or in patients chronically treated (≥8 weeks of continuous or intermittent corticosteroid use) with moderate doses (≥15 to <30 mg PEQ). Antimetabolites (azathioprine, mycophenolate) increase the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML); however, other opportunistic infections and viral reactivation have also been reported. In case of new onset of neurological symptoms, PML needs to be considered, and an urgent neurology consultation should be obtained. Cyclophosphamide-induced myelosuppression can lead to serious infections related to neutropenia. PJP prophylaxis should be considered with combination therapy of cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids until a PEQ dose ≤ 5 mg/d is reached. Data on infectious risk when cyclosporine is used in patients with nonmalignant hematologic diseases are lacking. Discontinuation of any immunosuppressive agent during an episode of infection is recommended. In all patients, adherence to an age-based immunization schedule is appropriate.","Malpica, Luis; Moll, Stephan",Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program,100,24

The safety and feasibility of bariatric surgery after liver transplantation is unknown. METHODS Nine morbidly obese patients with prior liver transplants underwent sleeve gastrectomy in a pilot program. Sleeve gastrectomy was chosen over gastric banding to avoid foreign body implantation, and over gastric bypass to maintain endoscopic access to the biliary system and reduce surgical complexity. We reviewed patient demographics, operative details, 30-day complications, weight loss, postoperative hepatic and renal functions, and resolution of comorbidities. RESULTS Sleeve gastrectomy was performed laparoscopically in eight patients and as an open procedure in one patient. The mean operative time was 165 min and mean postoperative length of stay was 5 days. Follow-up ranged from 3 to 36 months. In the first 30 days, there were three complications in three patients: mesh dehiscence after a synchronous incisional hernia repair, bile leak from the liver surface requiring laparoscopic drainage, and postoperative dysphagia that required reoperation. Calcineurin inhibitor levels and hepatic and renal functions remained stable. There were no episodes of graft rejection. At 3 months liver function tests remained stable. Excess weight loss averaged 55.5% at 6 months. CONCLUSION Sleeve gastrectomy is technically feasible after liver transplantation and resulted in weight loss without adversely affecting graft function and immunosuppression. Early complications may be more frequent as a result of adhesions of the left upper quadrant. Late complications were rare.","Lin, Matthew Y C; Tavakol, M Mehdi; Sarin, Ankit; Amirkiai, Shadee M; Rogers, Stanley J; Carter, Jonathan T; Posselt, Andrew M",Surgical endoscopy,100,29

Moreover, few studies focus on PM1 pollution despite its greater health effect. OBJECTIVES This study aims to determine the modification effects of climatic factors on the associations between PM1 and the incidence rates of lung cancer for males and females in China. METHODS We conducted a nationwide analysis in 345 Chinese counties (districts) from 2014 to 2015. Mean air temperature and relative humidity over the study period were used as the proxies of climatic conditions. In terms of the multivariable linear regression model, we examined climatic modification effects in the stratified and combined datasets according to the three-category and binary divisions of climatic factors. Moreover, we performed three sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of climatic modification effects. RESULTS We found a stronger association between PM1 and the incidence rate of male lung cancer in counties with high levels of air temperature or relative humidity. If there is a 10 μg/m3 shift in PM1, then the change in male incidence rate relative to its mean was higher by 4.39% (95% CI: 2.19, 6.58%) and 8.37% (95% CI: 5.18, 11.56%) in the middle and high temperature groups than in the low temperature group, respectively. The findings of climatic modification effects were robust in the three sensitivity analyses. No significant modification effect was discovered for female incidence rate. CONCLUSIONS Male residents in high temperature or humidity counties suffer from a larger effect of PM1 on the incidence rate of lung cancer in China. Future research on air pollution-related health impact assessment should consider the differential air pollution effects across different climatic conditions.","Guo, Huagui; Li, Xin; Li, Weifeng; Wu, Jiansheng; Wang, Siying; Wei, Jing",BMC public health,100,1

Here, interfacially driven assembly of carbon nanotubes (CNT) is exploited to fabricate structurally directed aerogels with highly controlled internal architectures, composed of pseudo-monolayer, CNT microcages. CNT Pickering emulsions enable engineering at fundamentally different length scales, whereby the microporosity, mesoporosity, and macroporosity are decoupled and individually controlled through CNT type, CNT number density, and process energy, respectively. In addition, metal nanocatalysts (Cu, Pd, and Ru) are embedded within the architectures through an elegant sublimation and shock-decomposition approach; introducing the first approach that enables through-volume functionalization of intricate, pre-designed aerogels without microstructural degradation. Catalytic structure-function relationships are explored in a pharma-important amidation reaction; providing insights on how the engineered frameworks enhance catalyst activity. A sophisticated array of advanced tomographic, spectroscopic, and microscopic techniques reveal an intricate 3D assembly of CNT building-blocks and their influence on the functional properties of the enhanced nanocatalysts. These advances set a basis to modulate structure and chemistry of functional aerogel materials independently in a controlled fashion for a variety of applications, including energy conversion and storage, smart electronics, and (electro)catalysis.","Mannering, Jamie; Stones, Rebecca; Xia, Dong; Sykes, Daniel; Hondow, Nicole; Flahaut, Emmanuel; Chamberlain, Thomas W; Brydson, Rik; Cairns, Gareth A; Menzel, Robert",Advanced materials,100,31

Here we tested the potential of human immune cells to protect against ZIKV infection in genetically humanized MISTRG mice. FACS analysis showed robust reconstitution of the mouse spleen with human T cells. Peripheral ZIKV inoculation resulted in infection within the brains of MISTRG mice. Mice that were reconstituted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) showed a more rapid lethal response to ZIKV than control mice lacking these immune cells. Immunocytochemical analysis of T cell markers CD3, CD45, or CD8 showed strong T cell presence in the brain, together with robust infection by ZIKV particularly in the excitatory pyramidal and granule neurons of the hippocampus. Infection was also found in cortex, striatum, the dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra, and other brain loci. Infection was considerably less in other regions such as the septum and hypothalamus. These data support the perspective that, rather than exerting a protective function, T cells may underlie some ZIKV-mediated neuropathology in the brain.","van den Pol, Anthony N; Zhang, Xue; Maher, Stephen E; Bothwell, Alfred L M",Developmental neurobiology,100,7

Anesthetic drugs may exert neurotoxic effects and contribute to the genesis of POCD. The hypothesis of the POCD-ELA trial was that closed-loop target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil could reduce the occurrence of POCD by decreasing the risk of excessive depth of anesthesia and the dose of anesthetic drugs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We designed a single-center, single-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel trial and aim to include 204 patients aged >60 years undergoing elective major non-cardiac surgery. Patients will be randomized to receive closed-loop versus manual target-controlled infusion of propofol and remifentanil guided by bispectral index monitoring. Cognitive assessment will be performed the day before surgery (baseline) and within 72 hours after surgery, using a battery of validated neuropsychological tests. The primary outcome is the incidence of POCD within 72 hours after surgery. POCD is defined as a Z-score value > 1.96 for at least 2 different tests or a Z-score composite value >1.96. The calculation of the Z-score is based on data from an age-matched control population who did not undergo surgery or general anesthesia.

Most research on this important topic, however, focused on how patients view the relationship and not how the physicians see it. This research strives to bridge this gap, with the resolution of leading to an improved appreciation of this multifaceted relationship. METHODS A survey of 328 actively practicing physicians from all four health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in Israel resulted in a hierarchical formation of components, indicating both the relative as well as absolute importance of each component in the formation of the patient-physician relationship. The sample conducted was a convenience one. Methodologically, we used two different complementary methods of analysis, with the primary emphasis on the Analytic Hierarchical Processing (AHP), a unique and advanced statistical method. RESULTS The results provide a detailed picture of physicians' attitudes toward the patient-physician relationship. Research indicates that physicians tend to consider the relationship with the patient in a rather pragmatic manner. To date, this attitude was mostly referred to intuitively, without the required rigorous investigation provided by this paper. Specifically, the results indicate that physicians tend to consider the relationship with the patient in a rather pragmatic manner. Namely, while fairness, reliability, devotion, and serviceability received high scores from physicians, social interaction, friendship, familial, as well as appreciation received the lowest scores, indicating low priority for warmth and sociability in the trust relationship from the physician's perspective. The results showed good consistency between the AHP results and the ANOVA comparable analyses. CONCLUSIONS In contrast to patients who traditionally stress the importance of interpersonal skills, physicians stress the significance of the technical expertise and knowledge of health providers, emphasizing the role of competence and performance. Physicians evaluate the relationship on the basis of their ability to solve problems through devotion, serviceability, reliability, and trustworthiness and disregard the ""softer"" interpersonal aspects such as caring, appreciation, and empathy that have been found to be important to their patients. This illustrates a mismatch in the important components of relationship building that can lead to a loss of trust, satisfaction, and repeat purchase. POLICY IMPLICATIONS We study the impact physicians' incentives have on the tangible relationship and discuss the significance of physician-patient relationship on satisfaction with the health service given. As a result policies leading to a more dynamic role must be given to the patient, who being well informed by the physician, can help in the decision making process. Policy schemes need to be implemented as a way of changing physicians' behavior, forcing them to better construct and utilize this dyadic relationship.","Berger, Ron; Bulmash, Ben; Drori, Netanel; Ben-Assuli, Ofir; Herstein, Ram",Israel journal of health policy research,100,31

However, previous case reports suggest that low-voltage shock impedance measurements may fail to detect insulation breaches that can cause life-threatening electrical short circuits. METHODS AND RESULTS We report six cases of insulation breaches in transvenous defibrillation leads that were not obvious during standard interrogations and testing of the lead beforehand. In two cases, an electrical short circuit during commanded shock delivery for internal electrical cardioversion resulted in a total damage of the ICD generator. In one of these cases, commanded shock delivery induced ventricular fibrillation, which required external defibrillation. In two cases, a shock due to ventricular tachycardia was aborted as the shock impedance was less than 20 Ohm. However, in both cases the tiny residual shock energy terminated the ventricular tachycardia. In contrast, in one case the residual energy of the aborted shock did not end ventricular fibrillation induced at defibrillator threshold testing. In one case, the ICD indicated an error code for a short circuit condition detected during an adequate shock delivery. CONCLUSIONS This case series illustrates that low-voltage shock impedance measurements can fail to detect insulation breaches. These data suggest that in patients without a contraindication, traditional defibrillator threshold testing or high voltage synchronized shock at the time of device replacement should be considered.

The present study evaluated the influenza-related outcomes between the influenza season 2019 and 2020 in Hong Kong as a result of these infection control measures. A Monte Carlo simulation model was designed to estimate the number of influenza cases, clinic visits, hospitalization, deaths, direct medical cost and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for the season 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 in six age groups: 0-5 years, 6-11 years, 12-17 years, 18-49 years, 50-64 years and ≥65 years in Hong Kong. Model inputs were derived from public data and existing literature. The model findings showed significant reduction in influenza-related cases, clinic visits, hospitalization, and deaths in 2020 versus 2019 (p < 0.05). Influenza-related direct costs in all age-groups were significantly reduced by 56%-82% (p < 0.01) in 2020 versus 2019. DALYs were also significantly decreased by 58%-85% (p < 0.01).

METHOD Pregnant women living in Quebec province (N = 1014) have been recruited in April 2020 through social media, while a state of health emergency was declared. Participants were divided in 4 groups, according to self-reported frequency of news media consulting (little or none; one time a day; several times a day; constant). They filled measures of depressive symptoms, negative affects, post-traumatic stress symptoms and anxiety specific to COVID-19. Instrument scores were grouped under a unique factor of psychological distress. RESULTS An ANCOVA controlling for age, gestational age, education level, household annual revenue and a diagnosed mental disorder present at the time of participation in study shows that news media exposure frequency is significantly associated with psychological distress severity in pregnant women, during COVID-19 pandemic, F(3,998) = 27.02, p < 0.001, η2 partial = 0.08. Given the mean comparisons a posteriori, higher psychological distress rates are found as soon as news media exposure exceeds once a day (effect sizes between 0.38 and 0.81). CONCLUSIONS The more pregnant women report consulting the news media during the COVID-19 pandemic, the more likely they are to exhibit psychological distress. Results provide one of the first empirical supports to recommendations of World Health Organization, Canada government and psychiatric associations that encourage population to limit their news media consulting during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Roxanne, Lemieux; Julia, Garon-Bissonnette; Mathilde, Loiselle; Élodie, Martel; Christine, Drouin-Maziade; Nicolas, Berthelot",Canadian journal of psychiatry.

From the initial discovery, it was recognized that the kidneys were organs very rich on ACE2. Subsequent studies demonstrated the precise localization of ACE2 within the kidney and the importance of this enzyme in the metabolism of Angiotensin II and the formation of Angiotensin 1-7. With the recognition early in 2020 of ACE2 being the main receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the interest in this protein has dramatically increased. In this review, we will focus on kidney ACE2; its localization, its alterations in hypertension, diabetes, the effect of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) on ACE2 and the potential use of ACE2 recombinant proteins therapeutically for kidney disease. We also describe the emerging kidney manifestations of COVID-19, namely the frequent development of acute kidney injury. The possibility that binding of SARS-CoV-2 to kidney ACE2 plays a role in the kidney manifestations is also briefly discussed.","Lores, Enrique; Wysocki, Jan; Batlle, Daniel",Clinical science,100,31

We investigated the effects of electrocautery on endothelial-cell and vessel-wall morphology at the ultrastructural level during ITA harvesting. Internal thoracic artery specimens from 20 patients who underwent elective coronary artery bypass grafting were investigated in 2 groups. The ITA grafts were sharply dissected with use of a scalpel and clips in the control group (n=10) and were harvested by means of electrocautery in the study group (n=10). Each sample was evaluated for intimal, elastic-tissue, muscular-layer, and adventitial changes. Free flow was measured intraoperatively. Light microscopic examinations were performed after hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome staining. Transmission electron microscopy was used to evaluate ultrastructural changes in the endothelial cells and vessel walls of each ITA. In the sharp-dissection group, the endothelial surfaces were lined with normal amounts of original endothelium, endothelial cells were distinctly attached to the basal lamina, cytoplasmic organelles were evident, and intercellular junctional complexes were intact. Conversely, in the electrocautery group, the morphologic integrity of endothelial cells was distorted, with some cell separations and splits, contracted cells, numerous large cytoplasmic vacuoles, and no visible cytoplasmic organelles. The subendothelial layer exhibited disintegration. Free ITA flow was higher in the sharp-dissection group (P=0.04). The integrity of endothelial cells can be better preserved when the ITA is mobilized by means of sharp dissection, rather than solely by electrocautery; we recommend a combined approach.","Onan, Burak; Yeniterzi, Mehmet; Onan, Ismihan Selen; Ersoy, Burak; Gonca, Suheyla; Gelenli, Elif; Solakoglu, Seyhun; Bakir, Ihsan",Texas Heart Institute journal,100,16

This study focuses on emergency general surgery services at a major trauma centre and teaching hospital. We aimed to identify whether the number of patients and the severity of their presentation has significantly changed since the implementation of a national lockdown. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study is a retrospective review of acute referrals (from general practice and accident and emergency) to the emergency general surgery team over a 14-day period before (group 1) and during (group 2) lockdown. RESULTS A total of 151 patients were reviewed by the general surgical team in group 1 and 75 in group 2 (a 50.3% reduction). The number of days with symptoms prior to presentation was significantly shorter in group 1 compared with group 2 (3 vs 4, p = 0.04). There was no significant difference in the National Early Warning Score, white blood cell count, lymphocytes and C-reactive protein on admission between the two groups of patients. There were significantly fewer patients admitted after lockdown compared with pre-lockdown (66% vs 48%, p = 0.01). Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter during lockdown compared with pre-lockdown (5 days vs 4 days, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION Fewer patients were referred and admitted during lockdown compared with pre-lockdown, and the length of stay was also significantly reduced. There was also a delay in presentation to hospital, although these patients were not more unwell based on the scoring criteria used within this study.","Patel, R; Hainsworth, A J; Devlin, K; Patel, J H; Karim, A",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,100,20

DATA SOURCES The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and grey literature were searched without language restrictions up to 9 September 2019. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS Two independent reviewers performed screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessments from a systematic search of observational studies and randomised controlled trials comparing AHT with a placebo or no AHT in adults with moderate or severe AS for any parameter of efficacy and safety outcomes. Conflicts were resolved by the third reviewer. Meta-analysis with pooled effect sizes using random-effects model, were estimated in R. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Mortality, Left Ventricular (LV) Mass Index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and LV ejection fraction RESULTS: From 3025 publications, 31 studies (26 500 patients) were included in the qualitative synthesis and 24 studies in the meta-analysis. AHT was not associated with mortality when all studies were pooled, but heterogeneity was substantial across studies. The effect size of AHT differed according to drug class. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) were associated with reduced risk of mortality (Pooled HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.80, p=0.006), The differences in changes of haemodynamic or echocardiographic parameters from baseline with and without AHT did not reach statistical significance.

However, there is a lack of data on the full clinical course of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Europe, especially in the population that developed acute respiratory failure (ARF). OBJECTIVES To identify risk factors associated with developing ARF during SARS-CoV-2 infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was an observational study of 60 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data were collected from March 26, 2020 to May 26, 2020 in a tertiary academic hospital in Poland. All patients reached final outcome (discharge from the hospital or death). We divided patients into 2 groups based on whether they developed ARF, compared their clinical data, and performed multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS Twenty-two patients (36%) from the observed cohort developed ARF. Logistic regression identified that a high sequential organ failure assessment score at admission (odds ratio (OR) = 6.97 (1.57-30.90, p = 0.011)), and a long time from admission until pneumonia (OR = 1.41 (1.06-1.87, p = 0.016)), correlated with ARF development. D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) differed both statistically and clinically between ARF and non-ARF groups. The mortality rate in the observed cohort of patients was 13.3%, and it was 32% in the group that developed ARF. CONCLUSIONS Routine vigilant examination of the above markers may identify patients at the highest risk of ARF early on during COVID-19 infection.","Piwowarczyk, Paweł; Szczukocka, Marta; Kutnik, Paweł; Borys, Michał; Mikłaszewska, Anna; Kiciak, Sławomir; Czuczwar, Mirosław",Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,100,1

Conversational agents are increasingly used for delivery of behavior change interventions in health care. Behavior change is complex and comprises the use of one or several components collectively known as behavioral change techniques (BCTs). OBJECTIVE The objective of this scoping review is to identify the BCTs that are used in behavior change-focused interventions delivered via conversational agents in health care. METHODS This scoping review will be performed in line with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and will be reported according to the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews guidelines. We will perform a comprehensive search of electronic databases and grey literature sources, and will check the reference lists of included studies for additional relevant studies. The screening and data extraction will be performed independently and in parallel by two review authors. Discrepancies will be resolved through consensus or discussion with a third review author. We will use a data extraction form congruent with the key themes and aims of this scoping review. BCTs employed in the included studies will be coded in line with BCT Taxonomy v1. We will analyze the data qualitatively and present it in diagrammatic or tabular form, alongside a narrative summary.

Cubic structures have been observed in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial membranes of cells under oxidative stress (e.g., tumor cells and virus-infected cells). It has been previously suspected that oxidation can result in the rearrangement of lipids from a fluid lamellar phase to a cubic structure in organelles containing membranes enriched with amphiphiles that have nonzero intrinsic curvature, such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and cardiolipin. This study focuses on the oxidation of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), a lipid that natively forms an inverted hexagonal phase at physiological conditions. The oxidized samples contain an approximately 3:2 molar ratio of nonoxidized to oxidized DOPE. Optical microscopy images collected during the hydration of this mixture from a dried film suggest that the system evolves into a coexistence of a stable fluid lamellar phase and transient square lattice structures with unit cell sizes of 500-600 nm. Small-angle X-ray scattering of the same lipid mixture yielded a body-centered Im3m cubic phase with the lattice parameter of 14.04 nm. On average, the effective packing parameter of the oxidized DOPE species was estimated to be 0.657 ± 0.069 (standard deviation). This suggests that the oxidation of PE leads to a group of species with inverted molecular intrinsic curvature. Oxidation can create amphiphilic subpopulations that potently impact the integrity of the membrane, since negative Gaussian curvature intrinsic to cubic phases can enable membrane destabilization processes.","Sankhagowit, Shalene; Lee, Ernest Y; Wong, Gerard C L; Malmstadt, Noah",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,100,1

Uric acid (UA) lowering therapies may reduce the risk of appearance or the progression of these comorbidities. In this work, we investigated the relationship between serum UA levels and inflammation in subjects with AHU. METHODS Serum levels of high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), TNF-α and IL-6, and mRNA expression of TNFa and IL6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured in individuals with AHU and without comorbid conditions and in a control group with similar characteristics and normal serum UA levels. Additionally, we determined the variations in the inflammatory profile in a subgroup of subjects after 6 months of treatment with allopurinol. RESULTS Subjects at higher tertiles of serum UA presented higher levels of hsCRP and increased serum and mRNA expression levels of both cytokines (P < 0.001). UA levels constituted an independent predictor of increased levels of inflammatory parameters in multiple regression models (P < 0.001) and a risk factor for the presence of a subclinical inflammation in multivariate logistic regression (P < 0.001). Allopurinol reduced UA and serum and mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines (P < 0.001). There was a significant correlation between the variations in serum UA and the variations in serum TNF-α (P < 0.01) and IL-6 (P < 0.05), and mRNA expression of these cytokines (P < 0.05). This association remained significant and independent (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION In subjects with AHU, serum UA may be an inductor of subclinical inflammation. Therapeutic reduction of serum UA was associated with a modulation of the inflammatory profile.","Luis-Rodríguez, Desirée; Donate-Correa, Javier; Martín-Núñez, Ernesto; Ferri, Carla; Tagua, Víctor G; Pérez Castro, Atteneri; Mora-Fernández, Carmen; Navarro-González, Juan F",Rheumatology,100,16

After safely performing laparoscopically-assisted transvaginal cholecystectomy in an IACUC-approved porcine model, we embarked on an IRB-approved protocol to ultimately perform a pure NOTES cholecystectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS We describe our experience with performing a true NOTES tansvaginal cholecystectomy after safely accomplishing 3 laparoscopically-assisted hybrid NOTES procedures in humans. To overcome the retracting limitations of currently available endoscopes, we used a 5-mm curved or articulating retractor that was placed into the abdomen via a separate colpotomy in the second and third patient. In a fourth patient, pneumoperitoneum to 15 torr was obtained via a transvaginal trocar placed through a colpotomy made under direct vision and endoscopically placed clips were used for both the cystic duct and artery, thus, obviating the need for any transabdominally placed instruments or needles. RESULTS This patient was the first patient to undergo a completely NOTES cholecystectomy at our institution and to our knowledge in the United States. She was discharged on the day of surgery and has not suffered any complication after 1 month of follow-up. CONCLUSION Pure NOTES transvaginal cholecystectomy without aid of laparoscopic or needleoscopic instruments is feasible and safe in humans. Additional experience with this technique will be required before comparative studies to standard laparoscopy and hybrid techniques are appropriate.","Gumbs, Andrew A; Fowler, Dennis; Milone, Luca; Evanko, John C; Ude, Akuezunkpa O; Stevens, Peter; Bessler, Marc",Annals of surgery,100,1

Except the biochemical index anomaly and the accidental death, 30 adult healthy adult Japanese white rabbits were used for screening out the potential metabolites in discovery experiment and 13 rabbits were used in verification experiment. The femoral heads were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging and transmission electron microscopy. The metabolomic profiling of serum samples were analysis by UHPLC-MS/MS. Metabolomic cluster analysis enable us to differentiate the rabbits without and with injection of the glucocorticoid in 1 week even when there is no obvious abnormal symptom in behaviors or imaging diagnosis. The majority of differential metabolites were identified as phospholipids which were observed significant change after injection of glucocorticoid in 1, 2, 3 weeks. And the results obtained in verification experiment of 6 weeks showed that these differential metabolites exhibited consistent trends in late progression with that in early-stage. At the end of 6 weeks the damage of SANFH could be verified by pathological imaging. Therefore the finding of serum metabolite profile links to the progression of SANFH and provides the potential of early detection of SANFH.","Ren, Xiangnan; Fan, Wu; Shao, Zixing; Chen, Kaiyun; Yu, Xuefeng; Liang, Qionglin",Oncotarget,100,1

However, adoption of COVID-19-related preventive behaviours remain relatively unknown. This study investigated predictors of preventive behaviours. METHODS An analytical sample of 897 Singaporean adults who were quota sampled based on age, gender, and ethnicity were recruited through a web-enabled survey. Outcomes were adoption of, or increased frequency of preventive behaviours (avoiding social events; avoiding public transport; reducing time spent shopping and eating out; wearing a mask in public; avoiding hospitals/clinics; keeping children out of school, washing hands/using sanitisers; keeping surroundings clean; avoiding touching public surfaces; working from/studying at home). Public perceptions regarding COVID-19 (chances of getting COVID-19; perceived likelihood of COVID-19-related intensive care unit (ICU) admission; government trust; self-efficacy; perceived appropriateness of COVID-19 behaviours; response efficacy), anxiety, and demographic characteristics (age; ethnicity; marital status; education; chronic conditions; current living arrangements) were investigated as predictors of preventive behaviours adopted during COVID-19 in binomial and ordered logistic regressions. RESULTS Though adoption of preventive behaviours among Singaporeans varied, it was, overall, high, and consistent with government recommendations. Nearly a quarter reported moderate to severe anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder 7-item - GAD-7 scores). Respondents who perceived higher COVID-19 risks, had higher government trust, higher self-efficacy, and perceived that others acted appropriately reported increased adoption/frequency of preventive measures. The strongest indicator of behavioural change was response efficacy. Respondents who were older, highly educated, anxious and married reported higher adoption/frequency of preventive measures. CONCLUSION To successfully influence appropriate preventive behaviours, public health messages should highlight response efficacy, increase self-efficacy, and promote trust in governmental response. Focus should be on demographic segments with low adoptions, such as younger individuals and those with low education.","Ozdemir, Semra; Ng, Sean; Chaudhry, Isha; Finkelstein, Eric Andrew",International journal of health policy and management,100,1

METHODS Right knees of 8-week-old male Wistar rats were injected with 1 mg MIA in 50 μl saline and left knees were injected with 50 μl saline as controls. After 1, 2, and 3 weeks (n = 5 at each time point), changes in cartilage morphology and composition were quantified using equilibrium partitioning of an ionic contrast agent microfocal computed tomography (μCT), and changes in subchondral and trabecular bone were assessed by standard μCT. ROS were characterized by in vivo fluorescence imaging at 1, 11, and 21 days (n = 5 at each time point). Three weeks following fluorescence imaging, alterations in knee joint vascularity were quantified with μCT after perfusion of a vascular contrast agent. RESULTS Femoral cartilage volume, thickness, and proteoglycan content were significantly decreased in MIA-injected knees compared with control knees, accompanied by loss of trabecular bone and erosion of subchondral bone surface. ROS quantities were significantly increased 1 day after MIA injection and subsequently decreased gradually, having returned to normal by 21 days. Vascularity in whole knees and distal femora was significantly increased at 21 days after MIA injection. CONCLUSION Contrast-enhanced μCT and fluorescence imaging were combined to characterize articular cartilage, subchondral bone, vascularization, and ROS, providing unprecedented 3-dimensional joint imaging and quantification in multiple tissues during OA progression. These advanced imaging techniques have the potential to become standardized methods for comprehensive evaluation of articular joint degeneration and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy.","Xie, LiQin; Lin, Angela S P; Kundu, Kousik; Levenston, Marc E; Murthy, Niren; Guldberg, Robert E",Arthritis and rheumatism,100,8

The yield of rice, a staple food across the world, is highly dependent on having proper irrigation systems. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) is an effective irrigation method mainly used for irrigated rice production. However, unattended, manual, small-scale, and discrete implementations cannot achieve the maximum benefit of AWD. Automation of large-scale (over 1000 acres) implementation of AWD can be carried out using wide-area wireless sensor network (WSN). An automated AWD system requires three different WSNs: one for water level and environmental monitoring, one for monitoring of the irrigation system, and another for controlling the irrigation system. Integration of these three different WSNs requires proper dimensioning of the AWD edge elements (sensor and actuator nodes) to reduce the deployment cost and make it scalable. Besides field-level monitoring, the integration of external control parameters, such as real-time weather forecasts, plant physiological data, and input from farmers, can further enhance the performance of the automated AWD system. Internet of Things (IoT) can be used to interface the WSNs with external data sources. This research focuses on the dimensioning of the AWD system for the multilayer WSN integration and the required algorithms for the closed loop control of the irrigation system using IoT. Implementation of the AWD for 25,000 acres is shown as a possible use case. Plastic pipes are proposed as the means to transport and control proper distribution of water in the field, which significantly helps to reduce conveyance loss. This system utilizes 250 pumps, grouped into 10 clusters, to ensure equal water distribution amongst the users (field owners) in the wide area.

The aim of this study is to find out the safer, easier, simpler, faster, and even cheaper way to overcome it. METHODS Vaginal vault suturing techniques of 152 consecutive single-port access total laparoscopic hysterectomy cases performed by the author in Gangnam CHA Hospital, CHA University from October 1, 2003 to June 30, 2012, were retrospectively analysed with medical records and DVDs. RESULTS Of 152 patients who were attempted SPA-TLH, 119 patients (78%) were finished their operations without conversion to multi-port laparoscopy or laparotomy. Of women with successful SPA-TLH, 8 cases (7%) were closed their vaginal vaults vaginally (median, 20 minutes; range, 15-44 minutes), and 111 cases (93%) laparoscopically (median, 44 minutes; range, 13-56 minutes). Laparoscopic vault closure techniques were continuous suture (4 cases, 3%; median, 36 minutes; range, 30-45 minutes), interrupted sutures using knot-pusher (7 cases, 6%; median, 52 minutes; range, 48-56 minutes) Endo Stitch suture (2 cases, 2%; median, 32 minutes; range, 13-50 minutes), continuous vault closure using percutaneous sling sutures (PCSS) (92 cases, 77%; median, 40 minutes; range, 19-56 minutes), and continuous vault closure without PCSS (6 cases, 5%; median, 23 minutes; range, 16-31 minutes). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic vault closure using PCSS in SPA-TLH only with conventional straight instruments is the best way to overcome the barrier and the short-cut to shorten the learning curve to date.","Park, Daehyun; Kim, Juyoung; Jun, Hye Sun; Jeong, Hyangjin; Park, Youngse",Obstetrics & gynecology science,100,7

One hundred cows were randomly divided into three groups: control group (CTRL, n = 20, without preventive treatment), second group (SUPP, n = 40 animals treated with a compound based on acetyl-methionine, inositol, cyanocobalamin, l-alanine, l-arginine, l-threonine, l-glutamic acid supplementation and α-lipoic acid) and third group (MON, n = 40 animals treated with monensin). Blood samples were collected from all cows at on 3 occasions pre-partum and 3 occasions post-partum. Body condition (BCS) score was evaluated and glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), BHB, triglycerides, total cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), total bilirubin, total proteins, globulins, albumin and urea concentrations were assessed. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance was applied. Statistically significant differences among the three experimental groups were found in the values of all studied parameters (P < 0.05). Our results confirm the established beneficial effect of MON treatment in decreasing BHB levels and increasing glucose availability after calving. Serum biochemical analysis revealed the expected post-partum alterations attributable to adaptations that influenced the metabolism and liver function in CTRL, whereas these alterations were reduced or absent in SUPP and MON. Results from the present study suggest that both preventive protocols, but in particular SUPP, could positively affect selected indicators of energy metabolism reducing the risk of hyperketonaemia and increase of liver function in Holstein dairy cows, both pre- and post-partum.","Fiore, Enrico; Perillo, Laura; Gianesella, Matteo; Giannetto, Claudia; Giudice, Elisabetta; Piccione, Giuseppe; Morgante, Massimo",The Journal of dairy research,100,28

METHODS Orthotopic hind-limb transplantations (Balb/c→C57BL/6) were performed using 6-8 week old mice. A thirty-day regimen of either rapamycin, tacrolimus (both 1, 3, 5mg/kg/d) or cyclosporine (25, 35, 50mg/kg/d) was used. Primary endpoints were animal and graft survival, and secondary chimerism and regulatory T cell levels. RESULTS For rapamycin and tacrolimus given at 1, 3, and 5mg/kg/day, median graft survival time (MST) was 23d(18-28d), 30d(23-30d), and 30d(30-30d) and 14d(13-18d), 30d(16-30d), and 30d(30-30d) respectively. For cyclosporine dosed at 25 and 35mg/kg/day, MST was 15d(12-18d) and 21d(14-27d). Toxicity from CsA 50mg/kg led to 100% mortality. Mixed chimerism levels were higher in rapamycin treated animals than in tacrolimus treated recipients (p=0.029). Tacrolimus was superior in preventing leukocyte recruitment to the allograft. CONCLUSIONS In murine VCA, no standardized immunosuppressive regimen exists, limiting comparability of outcomes and survival. Our data demonstrate that rapamycin and tacrolimus maintenance treatment at 5mg/kg/d both yielded allograft survival (< grade 3 rejection) in all animals. Rapamycin displayed less toxicity and maintained mixed chimerism, but was not as potent in controlling leukocyte recruitment compared to tacrolimus.","Guo, Yinan; Messner, Franka; Etra, Joanna W; Beck, Sarah E; Kalsi, Richa; Furtmüller, Georg J; Schneeberger, Stefan; Oh, Byoung Chol; Brandacher, Gerald",Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation,100,31

Young.",13.357189,6.189278,2021-05-01,"Sepsis was redefined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection in 2016. One of its most common causes is Staphylococcus aureus, especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which leads to a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. Therefore, innovative and effective approaches to combat MRSA infection are urgently needed. Recently, host-directed therapy (HDT) has become a new strategy in the treatment of infectious diseases, especially those caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Baicalin (BAI) is the predominant flavonoid and bioactive compound isolated from the roots of Radix Scutellariae (Huang Qin), a kind of traditional Chinese medicine. It has been reported that BAI exhibits multiple biological properties such as anti-oxidant, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory activities. However, the therapeutic role of BAI in MRSA infection is still unknown. In this study, it is found that BAI treatment inhibited the production of IL-6, TNF-α, and other cytokines from MRSA- or bacterial mimics-stimulated Mϕs and dendritic cells (DCs). BAI played an anti-inflammatory role by inhibiting the activation of ERK, JNK MAPK, and NF-κB pathways. Moreover, the serum level of TNF-α was decreased, whereas IL-10 was increased, in mice injected with MRSA. Furthermore, the bacterial load in livers and kidneys were further decreased by the combination of BAI and vancomycin (VAN), which might account for the amelioration of tissue damage. BAI reduced the high mortality rate caused by MRSA infection. Collectively, the results suggested that BAI may be a viable candidate of HDT strategy against severe sepsis caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as MRSA.","Shi, Ting; Li, Tiantian; Jiang, Xinru; Jiang, Xin; Zhang, Qingwen; Wang, Yuli; Zhang, Yaxing; Wang, Lixin; Qin, Xiangyang; Zhang, Weidong; Zheng, Yuejuan",Journal of leukocyte biology,100,1

Studies have suggested that long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNA) may serve a role in the pathophysiological processes of pulmonary fibrosis. However, the potential molecular mechanisms involving the lncRNA, prostate cancer‑associated transcript 29 (lncRNAPCAT29) in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis are yet to be determined. In the present study, the role of lncRNAPCAT29 and the potential signaling mechanism in pulmonary fibrosis progression was investigated. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression levels of lncRNAPCAT29 were downregulated within interstitial lung cells from mice with silica‑induced pulmonary fibrosis. Transfection with lncRNAPCAT29 was associated with upregulated expression of microRNA (miRNA)‑221 and downregulated expression of transforming growth factor‑β1 (TGF‑β1); reduced inflammation and fibrotic progression was also associated with lncRNAPCAT29 transfection. TGF‑β1 expression levels were inhibited within pulmonary fibroblasts due to lncRNAPCAT29 expression; NEDD4 binding protein 2 and Plexin‑A4 expression levels were also suppressed. Analysis of the potential mechanism underlying silica‑induced pulmonary fibrosis revealed that the expression levels of RAS protein activator like 1 (RASAL1) and extracellular signal‑regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) were suppressed due to lncRNAPCAT29 expression. The results of the present study demonstrated that lncRNAPCAT29 induced miRNA‑221 upregulation and TGF‑β1 downregulation. These observations were associated with reduced inflammation and progression of silica‑induced pulmonary fibrosis via the TGF‑β1‑regulated RASAL1/ERK1/2 signaling pathway, which may serve as a potential target for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.","Liu, Xiaoming; Gao, Shanyu; Xu, Huile",Molecular medicine reports,100,27

The expression of this molecule has been related to invasion and progression in malignant mixed tumors, such as carcinoma in mixed tumors (CMT) of the canine mammary gland. In addition, its interaction with surface cell receptors EGFR, HER-2 and CD44 in malignant epithelial cells may be responsible for proliferation and cellular motility in early stages of cancer. We comparatively evaluated the expression of this proteoglycan and its receptors in in situ and invasive areas of simple carcinomas (SC) and CMT to investigate similarities and differences between these histological types. Immunohistochemistry was performed with anti-VCAN, anti-CD44, anti-EGFR and anti-HER-2 antibodies in 32 cases of SC or CMT. VCAN was highly expressed in stroma adjacent to invasive areas in SC and CMT. CMTs presented comparatively higher expression of VCAN in stroma adjacent to in situ and in invasive areas than in corresponding areas in SCs. In CMT, EGFR and HER-2 expressions were higher in situ compared to invasive areas. In contrast, increased CD44 and EGFR expression was found in invasive areas in SC compared to CMT. These results indicate that versican expression is similarly associated with invasiveness in SC and CMT, however higher levels were seen in CMT suggesting that the presence of myoepithelial proliferation in this tumor type participates in stromal composition and promoting an increase in the expression of versican.","Figuerêdo, S H; Neto, R S Carmo; Ferreira, E; Cassali, G D; Estrela-Lima, A; Damasceno, K A",Research in veterinary science,100,29

Re-examining this association using up-to-date data reflecting current and real-world practices, across different global regions and in both haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, is important. METHODS We describe the association between serum phosphate and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in incident dialysis patients between 2008 and 2018 using the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) Registry. Time-dependent Cox proportionate hazards models were used. Models were adjusted for available covariates and fitted for the overall cohort, and also each dialysis modality. RESULTS 31,989 patients were followed over 97,122 person-years at risk (mean age at first dialysis 61 years, 38% female, 67% haemodialysis). We observed a U-shaped association between serum phosphate and all-cause mortality. In the fully adjusted model, categories of serum phosphate above and below 1.25 - 1.99 mmol/L were associated with progressively higher risk, reaching a hazard ratio of 2.13 (95% CI 1.93 - 2.36, p<0.001) for serum phosphate ≥2.75mmol/L, and 1.56 (95% CI 1.44 - 1.69, p<0.001) for serum phosphate <1.00mmol/L. Low and high levels of serum phosphate were also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, however the association with high serum phosphate was more pronounced (""J-shaped relationship""). The associations were consistent across sub-analyses of patients receiving haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis treatment. CONCLUSIONS In this large contemporary dialysis cohort, both high and low levels of serum phosphate were independently associated with increased risk of mortality.

It is becoming evident that mitochondrial dysfunction may regulate pathways controlling MPS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether AMPK-PGC-1α-SIRT3 axis is associated with depression of mitochondrial function in the rat MPS model. Methods A total of 32 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control group and experimental group. The expression level of mRNA and protein of gastrocnemius medialis (GM) was analyzed by Western blot and RT-PCR. The histopathological findings were investigated through electron microscopes in GM of all groups. Results Our results showed that MPS induces continuous depression of mitochondrial biogenesis and function via down-regulation of PGC-1α-SIRT3 axis accompanying with ATP fuel crisis as compared to control group. However, the expression level of SIRT3 mRNA did not change. Additionally, a correlated reduction of the mRNA and protein expression level of NRF-1 and TFAM, known as the downstream target of PGC-1α, suggesting further transcription of nuclear genes encoding mitochondria functional proteins for promoting mitochondria proliferation, oxidative phosphorylation and energy production is continuously depressed. Furthermore, phosphorylation extent of AMPK is also declined following MPS, and it is negatively correlated with reduction of ATP generation, suggesting that the complex network involves different inhibition in transcription, post-translational modification and a plethora of other effectors that mediate the inhibition roles. Conclusion We here suggested that the down-regulation in AMPK-PGC-1α-SIRT3 axis network may be the basis for the association between mitochondrial dysfunction and MPS, where a vicious circle further aggravates the disease symptoms with ongoing ATP energy crisis.","Ye, Le; Li, Mingli; Wang, Zhankui; Yang, Zhongwei; Zhang, Jinyuan; Fang, Hongwei; He, Zhenzhou; Wang, Xiangrui",Journal of pain research,100,1

In this in vitro study, we examined the stent-thrombus interaction and the influence of additional aspiration on the efficiency of mechanical thrombectomy with established stent retrievers. METHODS Human blood thrombi were made in a Chandler loop. The thrombi were placed into the middle cerebral artery of a vascular silicon phantom. A programmable piston pump was used to acquire physiological flow in the model. Resistances were interposed to gain physiological pressure. The stent retrievers Trevo, Solitaire FR, Separator 3D, and Aperio were used to perform thrombectomy under direct visual control. For the additional aspiration, we used intermediate catheters. RESULTS Ten attempts per device were made with and without aspiration under standardized conditions, a total of n = 80. For all thrombectomy maneuvers, it was demonstrated that the thrombus was pushed by the stent struts against the vessel wall and was retracted along it. The stent-thrombus interaction was only superficial for all devices. Using additional distal aspiration, the amount of distal embolism and rate of embolism in new territories was significantly lower than without. Moreover, additional aspiration reduced the number of recanalization maneuvers and the recanalization time. CONCLUSION Distal aspiration with intermediate catheters increases the efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers significantly. In contrary to earlier suggestions, the interaction between the thrombus and the stent retriever is only superficial, rather than an integration of the thrombus into the retriever. No significant differences between the proven devices could be shown in our model.","Madjidyar, Jawid; Hermes, Julian; Freitag-Wolf, Sandra; Jansen, Olav",Neuroradiology,100,16

The goal of this research was to better understand the connections between primary care and community organizations in addressing food insecurity. Methods Focus groups and key informant interviews with FMPC providers and members of local CBOs (2 food pantries) were held from 2018 to 2019. Perceptions of participants regarding food insecurity were collected and analyzed concurrently using a grounded theory approach. Focus groups were transcribed and data analyzed for theme emergence. Results A total of 39 participants took part in 4 focus groups (each with 8-10 participants) and 4 individual key informant interviews. The following themes emerged in both FMPC and CBO, in parallel yet separate ways: meaningful relationships; stigma; conversation starters; having the answers; safe spaces; and purposeful training. Conclusions There is a disconnect between primary care and community organizations in regard to addressing food insecurity. FMPC and CBO could work together to create intentional intersections to address food insecurity and health in their shared populations.","Runkle, Nicole K; Nelson, David A",Journal of patient-centered research and reviews,100,5

How such 'endogenous' viral elements (EVEs) ended up in host genomes is usually explained in general terms such as 'they entered the germ line at some point during evolution'. This seems a correct statement, but is also rather imprecise. The vast number of endogenous viral sequences suggest that common routes to the 'germ line' may exist, as relying on chance alone may not easily explain the abundance of EVEs in modern mammalian genomes. An increasing number of virus types have been detected in human semen and a growing number of studies have reported on viral infections that cause male infertility or subfertility and on viral infections that threaten in vitro fertilisation practices. Thus, it is timely to survey the pathway(s) that viruses can use to gain access to the human germ line. Embryo transfer and semen quality studies in livestock form another source of relevant information because virus infection during reproduction is clearly unwanted, as is the case for the human situation. In this review, studies on viruses in the male and female reproductive tract and in the early embryo will be discussed to propose a plausible viral route to the mammalian germ line.","van der Kuyl, Antoinette Cornelia; Berkhout, Ben",Virus research,100,20

Moreover, aggregated data mask further diversity within Asian Americans. This study aimed to examine depression risk by detailed Asian American subgroup, and further assess determinants within and between three Asian ethnic subgroups. Methods Needs assessment surveys were collected in 16 Asian American subgroups (six Southeast Asian, six South Asian, and four East Asian) in New York City from 2013-2016 using community-based sampling strategies. A final sample of N=1,532 completed the PHQ-2. Bivariate comparisons and multivariable logistic models explored differences in depression risk by subgroup. Results Southeast Asians had the greatest depression risk (19%), followed by South Asians (11%) and East Asians (9%). Among Southeast Asians, depression risk was associated with lacking health insurance (OR=.2, 95% CI: 0-.6), not having a provider who speaks the same language (OR=3.2, 95% CI: 1.3-8.0), and lower neighborhood social cohesion (OR= .94, 95% CI: .71-.99). Among South Asians, depression risk was associated with greater English proficiency (OR=3.9, 95% CI: 1.6-9.2); and among East Asians, depression risk was associated with ≤ high school education (OR=4.2, 95% CI: 1.2-14.3). Additionally, among Southeast Asians and South Asians, the highest depression risk was associated with high levels of discrimination (Southeast Asian: OR=9.9, 95% CI: 1.8-56.2; South Asian: OR=7.3, 95% CI: 3.3-16.2). Conclusions Depression risk and determinants differed by Asian American ethnic subgroup. Identifying factors associated with depression risk among these groups is key to targeting limited public health resources for these underserved communities.","Misra, Supriya; Wyatt, Laura C; Wong, Jennifer A; Huang, Cindy Y; Ali, Shahmir H; Trinh-Shevrin, Chau; Islam, Nadia S; Yi, Stella S; Kwon, Simona C",Ethnicity & disease,100,11

A mechanism for these injuries is not clear. The monopolar ""bovie"" emits radiofrequency energy that transfers to nearby, nonelectrically active cables or wires without direct contact by capacitive and antenna coupling. The purpose of this study was to determine if, and to what extent, radiofrequency energy couples to common patient monitoring devices. MATERIALS AND METHODS In an ex vivo porcine model, monopolar radiofrequency energy was delivered to a handheld ""bovie"" pencil. Nonelectrically active neuromonitoring and cardiac-monitoring leads were placed in proximity to the monopolar pencil and its cord. Temperature changes of tissue touched by the monitoring lead were measured using a thermal camera immediately after a 5-second activation. The energy-device cords were then separated by 15 cm, the power was reduced from 30 W coag to 15 W coag and different cord angulation was tested. An advanced bipolar device, a plasma-based device, and an ultrasonic device were also tested at standard settings. RESULTS The neuromonitoring lead increased tissue temperature at the insertion site by 39 ± 13°C (P<0.001) creating visible char at the skin. The electrocardiogram lead raised tissue temperature by 1.3 ± 0.5°C (P<0.001). Decreasing generator power from 30 W to 15 W and separating the bovie cord from the neuromonitoring cord by 15 cm significantly reduced the temperature change (39 ± 13°C vs. 26±5°C; P<0.001 and 39 ± 13°C vs. 10 ± 5°C; P<0.001, respectively). Lastly, monopolar energy increased tissue temperatures significantly more than argon beam energy (34 ± 15°C), advanced bipolar energy (0.2 ± 0.4°C), and ultrasonic energy (0 ± 0.3°C) (all P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Stray energy couples to commonly used patient monitoring devices resulting in potentially significant thermal injury. The handheld bovie cord transfers energy via antenna coupling to neuromonitoring leads that can raise tissue temperatures over 100°F (39°C) using standard settings. The most effective ways to decrease this energy coupling is to reduce generator power, increase the separation between wires, or utilize lower voltage energy devices such as ultrasonic or bipolar energy.","Townsend, Nicole T; Jones, Edward L; Paniccia, Alessandro; Vandervelde, Joel; McHenry, Jennifer R; Robinson, Thomas N","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",100,19

METHODS A systematic review with network meta-analysis, surface under the cumulative ranking analysis and stochastic multicriteria acceptability analyses were performed. Searches were conducted in Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science without limits for time-frame or language. Randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy or safety of any PDE5i compared to a placebo or to other PDE5i in males with erectile disfunction were included. RESULTS Overall, 184 articles representing 179 randomized controlled trials (50,620 patients) were included. All PDE5i were significantly more efficient than placebo. Sildenafil 25 mg was statistically superior to all interventions in enhancing IIEF (with a 98% probability of being the most effective treatment), followed by sildenafil 50 mg (80% of probability). Taladafil 10 mg and 20 mg also presented good profiles (73% and 76%, respectively). Avanafil and lodenafil were less effective interventions. Mirodenafil 150 mg was the treatment that caused more adverse events, especially flushing and headaches. Sildenafil 100 mg was more related to visual disorders, while vardenafil and udenafil were more prone to cause nasal congestion. CONCLUSION Sildenafil at low doses and tadalafil should be the first therapeutic options. Avanafil, lodenafil and mirodenafil use are hardly justified given the lack of expressive efficacy or high rates of adverse events.","Madeira, Camilla R; Tonin, Fernanda S; Fachi, Mariana M; Borba, Helena H; Ferreira, Vinicius L; Leonart, Leticia P; Bonetti, Aline F; Moritz, Rogerio P; Trindade, Angela C L B; Gonçalves, Alan G; Fernandez-Llimos, Fernando; Pontarolo, Roberto",World journal of urology,100,24

The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional role of circular RNA ITCH (circ-ITCH) in OSCC and the underlying mechanisms. Methods RT-qPCR analysis was applied to detect the expression levels of circ-ITCH in OSCC tissues and cell lines. MTT assay and flow cytometer analysis were used to evaluate the effects of circ-ITCH overexpression on the proliferation and apoptosis of OSCC cells. Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter assay were applied to determine the binding relation between circ-ITCH and miR-421 as well as PDCD4 mRNA and miR-421. Results Our results showed that circ-ITCH expression was remarkably decreased in OSCC tissues and cell lines. Low circ-ITCH expression was strongly associated with adverse clinicopathological characteristics of OSCC patients. Moreover, functional assays demonstrated that circ-ITCH overexpression significantly inhibited OSCC cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Our data further uncovered that circ-ITCH could bind directly to miR-421 and block its repression on PDCD4 in OSCC. MiR-421 expression was significantly increased in OSCC tissues and was inversely correlated with circ-ITCH expression. Notably, miR-421 restoration blocked the tumor-suppressive role of circ-ITCH in OSCC cells. Conclusion In conclusion, our study reveals that circ-ITCH serves as a tumor suppressor in OSCC partly by regulating miR-421/PDCD4 axis.","Hao, Chunbo; Wangzhou, Kaixin; Liang, Zhengeng; Liu, Cheng; Wang, Linlin; Gong, Lei; Tan, Yi; Li, Conghui; Lai, Zhiying; Hu, Guangwei",Cancer management and research,100,1

In this study, 5-sulfosalicylic acid and boswellic acids (BAs) were loaded to the pH sensitive zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) nanocomposite containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the center. The ZIF layer acts as a capsule for the nontoxic storage of 5-sulfosalicylic acid and boswellic acids (BAs) under physiological conditions. The results of the characterization demonstrated the performance of the nanocarrier formation. The pH-sensitive drug release of 5-sulfosalicylic acid was detected due to the innate pH-dependent stability of ZIF-8.

Some of them are grown as ornamental plants and others can be used as medicinal plants. In the present study, ethanolic extracts from trunks and leaves of Tecoma species were tested in vitro using assays against the Zika virus. METHODS There was a total of 8 extracts obtained from different anatomical parts of three Tecoma species. The Tecoma castaneifolia, T. garrocha, T. stans var. angustata and T. stans var. stans were prepared by percolation with ethanol. The antiviral activity was assayed in vitro against the Zika virus by the MTT colorimetric method (n = 3). The UPLC-DAD-MS analysis of ethanolic extracts was performed from all the studied species. The biofractionation of T. stans var. stans trunk extract using different separation techniques led to the isolation of crenatoside compound. RESULTS Ethanolic extract from Tecoma species leaves were more active against the Zika virus (EC50 149.90 to 61.25 μg/mL) when compared to the trunk extracts tested (EC50 131.0 to 66.79 μg/mL and two were not active). The ethyl acetate and aqueous fractions obtained from T. stans var. stans trunk were active against the Zika virus with EC50 values of 149.90 and 78.98 μg/mL, respectively. Crenatoside is a phenylethanoid glycoside isolated from the ethyl acetate of T. stans var. stans trunk extract. This compound was tested and exhibited EC50 34.78 μM (21.64 μg/mL), thus demonstrating a better result than the original ethanolic extracts as well as others extracts of Tecoma species, and it was more active than the positive control, ribavirin (386.84 μM). Furthermore, its selectivity index was at least 2.5 times higher than the tested ethanolic extracts and 11.1 times more potent than ribavirin. CONCLUSION The Tecoma species demonstrated interesting in vitro activity against the Zika virus. The crenatoside, phenylethanoid glycoside that was for the first time isolated from Tecoma stans var. stans, exhibited a potent and relevant anti-Zika virus activity, being more active than ribavirin (positive control). The data show that crenatoside, was a promising compound with in vitro antiviral activity against the Zika virus.","Reis, Adriana Cotta Cardoso; Silva, Breno Mello; de Moura, Hélia Maria Marques; Pereira, Guilherme Rocha; Brandão, Geraldo Célio",BMC complementary medicine and therapies,100,24

This study aimed to compare the participation, support and barriers for children with ADHD at home pre-COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS The study included 55 children with ADHD aged 6-11 years. Participation frequency, involvement, desire for change, supports and barriers at home were assessed using the Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth (PEM-CY). RESULTS During the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the pre-COVID-19 period, the mean frequency of participation of children with ADHD in computer and video games (5.8% vs 5%, respectively), socialising with other people (7% vs 6.2%) and household chores (5.5% vs 4.6%) was shown to be significantly higher (p < 0.05). Mothers of children with ADHD reported higher levels of involvement during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the pre-COVID-19 period across four areas of home participation, including computer and video games (4.1% vs 3.2%, respectively), arts, crafts, music and hobbies (3.7% vs 3%), household chores (3.6% vs 2.8%) and personal care management (4.2% vs 3.5%) p < 0.05). Mothers of children with ADHD reported that during the pandemic the following two features of the environment made participation easier than pre-COVID-19 (p < 0.05): cognitive demands (36.4% vs 60%, respectively) and social demands (5.5% vs 34.5%). More mothers reported that services (92.7%), supplies (87.3%) and information (85.5%) were available and/or adequate in the COVID-19 period than pre-COVID-19 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Mothers of children with ADHD reported that their children were participating more frequently in some of the home-related activities during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to pre-COVID-19. Reduced cognitive and social demands, and more readily available resources in the home environment during the COVID-19 period resulted in increased home participation compared to pre-COVID-19.","Kaya Kara, Ozgun; Tonak, Hasan Atacan; Kara, Koray; Sonbahar Ulu, Hazal; Kose, Barkin; Sahin, Sedef; Kara, Mahmut Zabit",Public health,100,16

Dz13 is a deoxyribozyme that targets JUN messenger RNA and has inhibited the growth of a range of tumours in mice. We did a phase 1 study to assess safety and tolerability in human beings. METHODS Adults with nodular basal-cell carcinoma were recruited from Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia, between September, 2010, and October, 2011. Patients were assigned to receive one intratumoral injected dose of 10, 30, or 100 μg Dz13, in a 50 μL volume of lipid carrier, and were assessed for adverse effects in the first 24 h then at 7, 14, and 28 days after injection. Treated tumours were surgically excised 14 days after injection and compared with the baseline biopsy samples for expression of c-Jun and tumorigenesis markers. FINDINGS Nine patients were recruited, of whom three received each dose of Dz13. All patients completed the study with no drug-related serious adverse events. No systemic Dz13 exposure was detected. c-Jun expression was reduced in the excised tumours of all nine (100%) patients, compared with baseline, and histological tumour depth had decreased in five (56%) of nine. Proportions of cells positive for caspases 3, 8, and 9 and P53 were increased, but those of cells positive for Bcl-2 and MMP-9 were decreased. Infiltration by inflammatory and immune cells was stimulated. INTERPRETATION Dz13 was safe and well tolerated after single intratumoral injections at all doses.

Recent data demonstrate that dysphagia is mostly persisting and that its presence is independently associated with adverse patient-centered clinical outcomes. Although several risk factors possibly contributing to dysphagia development were proposed, the underlying exact mechanisms in ICU patients remain incompletely understood and no current consensus exists on how to best approach ICU patients at risk.From a clinical perspective, dysphagia is well-known to be associated with an increased risk of aspiration and aspiration-induced pneumonia, delayed resumption of oral intake/malnutrition, decreased quality of life, prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay, and increased morbidity and mortality. Moreover, the economic burden on public health care systems is high.In light of high mortality rates associated with the presence of dysphagia and the observation that dysphagia is not systematically screened for on most ICUs, this review describes epidemiology, terminology, and potential mechanisms of dysphagia on the ICU. Furthermore, the impact of dysphagia on affected individuals, health care systems, and society is discussed in addition to current and future potential therapeutic approaches.","Zuercher, Patrick; Moret, Céline S; Dziewas, Rainer; Schefold, Joerg C",Critical care,100,28

Gluten-dependent injury can be evaluated either with quantitative morphometry or grouped classifications. A drawback of mucosal readings is the subjective assessment of the border where the crypt epithelium changes to the differentiated villus epithelium. We studied potential immunohistochemical markers for the detection of the villus-crypt border: apolipoprotein A4 (APOA4), Ki-67, glucose transporter 2, keratin 20, cytochrome P450 3A4 and intestinal fatty-acid binding protein. Among these, villus-specific APOA4 was chosen as the best candidate for further studies. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E)- and APOA4 stained duodenal biopsy specimens from 74 adult patients were evaluated by five observers to determine the villus-to-crypt ratio (VH : CrD). APOA4 delineated the villus to crypt epithelium transition clearly, and the correlation coefficient of VH : CrD values between APOA4 and H&E was excellent (r=0.962). The VH : CrD values were lower in APOA4 staining (p<0.001) and a conversion factor of 0.2 in VH : CrD measurements was observed to make the two methods comparable to each other. In the intraobserver analysis, the doubled standard deviations, representing the error ranges, were 0.528 for H&E and 0.388 for APOA4 staining, and the ICCs were 0.980 and 0.971, respectively. In the interobserver analysis, the average error ranges were 1.017 for H&E and 0.847 for APOA4 staining, and the ICCs were better for APOA4 than for H&E staining in all analyses. In conclusion, the reliability and reproducibility of morphometrical VH : CrD readings are improved with the use of APOA4 staining.","Taavela, Juha; Viiri, Keijo; Välimäki, Anna; Sarin, Jani; Salonoja, Kristiina; Mäki, Markku; Isola, Jorma",Frontiers in immunology,100,16

In view of the severe antibiotic contamination in arable soils owing to land application of sewage sludge and animal manure, the invasion of MPs along with antibiotics may pose an unpredictable threat to soil microbial communities and ecological health. In this work, polyethylene MPs and ciprofloxacin (CIP) were applied to a soil microcosm to investigate the CIP degradation behavior and their combined effects on soil microbial communities. Compared with that of the individual amendment of CIP, the co-amendment of CIP and MPs reduced the CIP degradation efficiency during the 35 d cultivation period. In addition, the high-throughput sequencing results illustrated that the combined loading of MPs and CIP in soil significantly decreased the microbial diversity compared with that of individual contamination. As for the community structure, the microbial compositions at the phylum level were consistent among all treatments, and the most dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi. At the genus level, only one genus, namely Arthrobacter, was remarkably changed in the CIP-amended soil compared with that in the blank control, but four genera were significantly altered in the MPs-CIP co-amended soil. Serratia and Achromobacter were abundant in the combined polluted soil, which might have been involved in accelerated depletion of soil total nitrogen based on redundancy analysis. These findings may contribute to the understanding of bacterial responses to the combined pollution of MPs and antibiotics in soil ecosystems.","Wang, Jiao; Liu, Xianhua; Dai, Yexin; Ren, Jun; Li, Yang; Wang, Xin; Zhang, Pingping; Peng, Chu",The Science of the total environment,100,8

Methods Seven databases were systematically searched. Included studies used water promotion as the primary intervention; used a controlled trial, single group pre-post, or prospective cohort study design; included a measure of SSB consumption or purchase; enrolled human participants of any age who lived in high-income or middle-income countries; contained original data; and appeared in a peer-reviewed English-language article published from 1 January 2000 to January 4, 2019. The search yielded 7068 publications, from which 108 were chosen for full-text review. Seventeen were included in this review. Results Nine of the 17 studies were randomized controlled trials, six were nonrandomized controlled trials, and 2 were single-group pre-post studies. Participants were primarily children and adolescents. Interventions included water provision, education or promotion activities. Ten of 17 studies were at low or some/moderate risk of bias. Seven studies showed a statistically significant decrease in SSB consumption of which only 2 were at low or some/moderate risk of bias. Conclusions This review found limited evidence that interventions aimed solely at increasing water consumption reduce SSB intake. Further research is needed to investigate whether interventions that combine water promotion and SSB reduction strategies could be synergistic for reducing SSB intake.","Dibay Moghadam, Sepideh; Krieger, James W; Louden, Diana K N",Obesity science & practice,100,24

Some lesions may be difficult to locate thoracoscopically with conversion to open thoracotomy or incomplete resection being potential limitations to this approach. Multiple methods have been described to aid video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) wedge resection of pulmonary nodules, including hookwire localization, percutaneous tattoo, or intraoperative ultrasound. We report on our experience using electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopic dye marking of small subpleural lesions to aid VATS wedge resection. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing VATS wedge resection of peripheral lesions. Preoperative bronchoscopy with electromagnetic navigation was utilized to guide a 25 G needle to within/adjacent to the target lesion with injection of 1 mL of methylene blue or indigo carmine under fluoroscopic vision. RESULTS Six patients underwent bronchoscopic marking of peripheral pulmonary lesions, navigation deemed successful in all patients, with no procedural complications. Surgery was performed within 24 hours of bronchoscopic marking. Pleural staining by dye was visible thoracoscopically in all 6 lesions either adjacent to or overlying the lesion. All lesions were fully excised with wedge resection. Pathologic examination confirmed accuracy of dye staining. CONCLUSIONS Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopic dye marking of peripheral lesions is feasible, without complications commonly associated with percutaneous marking procedures. Further experience is required but early findings suggest that this method may have utility in aiding minimally invasive resection of small subpleural lesions.","Tay, Jun H; Wallbridge, Peter D; Larobina, Marco; Russell, Prudence A; Irving, Louis B; Steinfort, Daniel P",Journal of bronchology & interventional pulmonology,100,1

In this study, EFV12 antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties are characterised. In particular, we propose a possible mechanism of action for EFV12 involving bacterial membranes targeting. Moreover, we show that this small peptide is able to bind lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and to counteract its inflammatory insult preventing LPS action on Toll-like receptor 4, thus interfering with extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38 and Jun N-terminal kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinases signalling pathways. Altogether these observations suggest that the bioactive peptide EFV12 is a good candidate to promote L. gasseri induced gut homeostasis and counteracting intestinal pathogens.","Napoli, M Di; Luccia, B Di; Vitiello, G; D'Errico, G; Carpentieri, A; Pezzella, A; Pizzo, E; Notomista, E; Varcamonti, M; Zanfardino, A",Beneficial microbes,100,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of all percutaneous IRE ablations of hepatic tumors within 1 cm of the common, left, or right hepatic ducts at a single institution from January 2011 to September 2012. Computed tomography imaging performed before and after treatment was examined for evidence of bile duct dilatation, stricture, or leakage. Serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels were analyzed for evidence of biliary injury. RESULTS There were 22 hepatic metastases in 11 patients with at least one tumor within 1 cm of the common, left, or right hepatic duct that were treated with IRE ablations in 15 sessions. Median tumor size treated was 3.0 cm (mean, 2.8 cm ± 1.2, range, 1.0-4.7 cm). Laboratory values obtained after IRE were considered abnormal after four treatment sessions in three patients (bilirubin, 2.6-17.6 mg/dL; alkaline phosphatase, 130-1,035 U/L); these abnormal values were transient in two sessions. Two patients had prolonged elevation of values, and one required stent placement; both of these conditions appeared to be secondary to tumor progression rather than bile duct injury. CONCLUSIONS This clinical experience suggests that IRE may be a treatment option for centrally located liver tumors with margins adjacent to major bile ducts where thermal ablation techniques are contraindicated. Further studies with extended follow-up periods are necessary to establish the safety profile of IRE in this setting.","Silk, Mikhail T; Wimmer, Thomas; Lee, Kyungmouk S; Srimathveeravalli, Govindarajan; Brown, Karren T; Kingham, Peter T; Fong, Yuman; Durack, Jeremy C; Sofocleous, Constantinos T; Solomon, Stephen B",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,100,6

We developed a stepwise Markov model (a) to make a short-term prediction of the number of patients on ventilator, and (b) to determine a possible date for a ventilator crisis. Starting with the exponential curve of new cases in the previous 14 days, we calculated a Markov model every 5 days thereafter, resulting in a daily estimate of patients on ventilator for the following 25 days, which we compared with the daily number of devices in use to predict a date for ventilator crisis. During the modeled period, the observed and predicted Markov curves of patients on ventilator were very similar, a finding confirmed by both linear regression (r=0.984;p<0.0001) and the near coincidence with the identity line. Our model estimated ventilator shortage in Chile for June 1st, if the number of devices had remained stable. However, the crisis did not occur due to acquisition of new ventilators by the Ministry of Health. In Chile as in many other countries experiencing several asynchronous local peaks of COVID-19, the stepwise Markov model could become a useful tool for predicting the date of mechanical ventilator crisis. We propose that our model could help health authorities to: (a) establish a better ventilator distribution strategy and (b) be ready to reinstate restrictions only when necessary so as not to paralyze the economy as much. © 2021 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Olmos, P.

Experimentally infected camelids clear infectious virus within one week and mount an effective adaptive immune response. Here, transcription of immune response genes was monitored in the respiratory tract of MERS-CoV infected alpacas. Concomitant to the peak of infection, occurring at 2 days post inoculation (dpi), type I and III interferons (IFNs) were maximally transcribed only in the nasal mucosa of alpacas, provoking the induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) along the whole respiratory tract. Simultaneous to mild focal infiltration of leukocytes in nasal mucosa and submucosa, upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 and dampened transcription of pro-inflammatory genes under NF-κB control were observed. In the lung, early (1 dpi) transcription of chemokines (CCL2 and CCL3) correlated with a transient accumulation of mainly mononuclear leukocytes. A tight regulation of IFNs in lungs with expression of ISGs and controlled inflammatory responses, might contribute to virus clearance without causing tissue damage. Thus, the nasal mucosa, the main target of MERS-CoV in camelids, is central in driving an efficient innate immune response based on triggering ISGs as well as the dual anti-inflammatory effects of type III IFNs and IL10. Author summary Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the etiological agent of a respiratory disease causing high mortality in humans. In camelids, the main MERS-CoV reservoir host, viral infection leads to subclinical disease. Our study describes transcriptional regulations of innate immunological pathways underlying asymptomatic clinical manifestations of alpacas in response to MERS-CoV. Concomitant to the peak of infection, these animals elicited a strong transient interferon response and induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 in the nasal mucosa. This was associated to a dimmed regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induction of interferon stimulated genes along the whole respiratory mucosa, leading to the rapid clearance of the virus. Thus, innate immune responses occurring in the nasal mucosa appear to be the key in controlling MERS-CoV disease by avoiding a cytokine storm. Understanding on how asymptomatic host reservoirs counteract MERS-CoV infection will aid in the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines.","Te, Nigeer; Rodon, Jordi; Ballester, Maria; Pérez, Mónica; Pailler-García, Lola; Segalés, Joaquim; Vergara-Alert, Júlia; Bensaid, Albert",bioRxiv,100,13

Though the method has been used for several decades to track other infectious diseases, there has not been a comprehensive review outlining all of the pathogens surveilled through wastewater. The aim of this study is to identify what infectious diseases have been previously studied via wastewater surveillance prior to the COVID-19 Pandemic and identify common characteristics between the studies, as well as identify current gaps in knowledge. Peer-reviewed articles published as of August 1, 2020 that examined wastewater for communicable and infectious human pathogens on 2 or more occasions were included in the study. Excluded from this list were all reviews and methods papers, single collection studies, and non-human pathogens. Infectious diseases and pathogens were identified in studies of wastewater surveillance, as well as themes of how wastewater surveillance and other measures of disease transmission were linked. This review did not include any numerical data from individual studies and thus no statistical analysis was done. 1005 articles were identified but only 100 were included in this review after applying the inclusion criteria. These studies came from 38 countries with concentration in certain countries including Italy, Israel, Brazil, Japan, and China. Twenty-five separate pathogen families were identified in the included studies, with the majority of studies examining pathogens from the family Picornaviridae, including polio and non-polio enteroviruses. Most studies of wastewater surveillance did not link what was found in the wastewater to other measures of disease transmission. Among those studies that did compare wastewater surveillance to other measures of disease transmission the value observed was dependent upon pathogen and varied by study. Wastewater surveillance has historically been used to assess water-borne and fecal-orally transmitted pathogens causing diarrheal disease. However, numerous other types of pathogens have been surveilled using wastewater and wastewater surveillance should be considered as a potential tool for many infectious diseases. Wastewater surveillance studies can be improved by incorporating other measures of disease transmission at the population-level including disease incidence and hospitalizations.","Kilaru, P.; Hill, D.; Anderson, K.; Collins, M.

Methods: Clinical and laboratory findings were obtained from 50 confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Saiful Anwar General Hospital, Malang, Indonesia, from September to November 2020. Thrombotic events during hospitalization were recorded, and the ISTH disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score was used to classify overt DIC. Hypovitaminosis D was defined by serum vitamin D level <49.92 nmol/L. Results: Among 50 patients, 42 (84%) had hypovitaminosis D, and 6 (12%) developed thrombotic events. Vitamin D levels were lower in patients with thrombotic events (p=0.015), D-dimer >2 mg/L (p=0.006), ISTH DIC score _5 (p=0.020), admitted on ICU (p=0.002), and non-survivor groups (p=0.007). Multivariate analysis for the risk in increased D-dimer levels showed low vitamin D as the only significant risk factor with OR 1.8 (1.2-4.4), p=0.034. Low vitamin D also increased the risk for developing overt DIC with OR. 5.4 (1.0-30.2), p=0.039. Vitamin D level had negative correlations with ferritin (R=-0.316, p=0.044) and CRP (R=-0.530, p=0.000). Conclusions: In conclusion, a low level of vitamin D was found in most hospitalized COVID-19 patients and might be associated with the development of coagulopathy.","Susianti, H.; Wahono, C.

Their ability to mount adequate vaccine responses is unclear. Aim: to assess immune responses to mRNA-COVID-19 vaccine, and safety profile, in patients with IBD stratified according to therapy, compared to healthy controls (HC). Methods: Prospective, controlled, multi-center Israeli study. Subjects enrolled received two BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) doses. Anti-spike (S) antibodies levels and functional activity, anti-TNF levels and adverse events (AEs) were detected longitudinaly. Results: Overall 258 subjects: 185 IBD (67 treated with anti-TNF), and 73 HC. After the first vaccine dose all HC were seropositive, while some patients with IBD, regardless of treatment, remained seronegative. After the second dose all subjects were seropositive, however anti-S levels were significantly lower in anti-TNF treated compared to untreated patients, and HC (p<0.001; p<0.001, respectively). Neutralizing and inhibitory functions were both lower in anti-TNF treated compared to untreated patients, and HC (p<0.03; p<0.0001, respectively). Anti-TNF drug levels and vaccine responses did not affect anti-S levels. Infection rate (~2%) and AEs were comparable in all groups. IBD activity did not change in response to BNT162b2. Conclusions: In this prospective study in patients with IBD stratified according to treatment all patients mounted an immune response to two doses of BNT162b2. However, its magnitude was significantly lower in patients treated with anti-TNF, regardless of administration timing and drug levels. Vaccine was safe.

DeLUCS uses Chaos Game Representations (CGRs) of primary DNA sequences, and generates “mimic” sequence CGRs to self-learn data patterns (genomic signatures) through the optimization of multiple neural networks. A majority voting scheme is then used to determine the final cluster assignment for each sequence. The clusters learned by DeLUCS match true taxonomic groups for large and diverse datasets, with accuracies ranging from 77% to 100%: 2,500 complete vertebrate mitochondrial genomes, at taxonomic levels from sub-phylum to genera; 3,200 randomly selected 400 kbp-long bacterial genome segments, into clusters corresponding to bacterial families; three viral genome and gene datasets, averaging 1,300 sequences each, into clusters corresponding to virus subtypes. DeLUCS significantly outperforms two classic clustering methods (K-means++ and Gaussian Mixture Models) for unlabelled data, by as much as 47%. DeLUCS is highly effective, it is able to cluster datasets of unlabelled primary DNA sequences totalling over 1 billion bp of data, and it bypasses common limitations to classification resulting from the lack of sequence homology, variation in sequence length, and the absence or instability of sequence annotations and taxonomic identifiers. Thus, DeLUCS offers fast and accurate DNA sequence clustering for previously intractable datasets.","Millán Arias, Pablo; Alipour, Fatemeh; Hill, Kathleen A.; Kari, Lila",bioRxiv,100,13

According to estimates of Chinese scientists, their number is currently more than 500 thousand people. Considering that COVID-19 leads to suppression of immunity and the emergence of opportunistic infections in HIV-negative patients, the activation of secondary diseases in patients with HIV is natural. In view of this, the study of the features of the X-ray morphological picture of inflammatory changes in the lungs according to MSCT data in patients with COVID-19/HIV became the goal of this study. 13 patients who underwent treatment at the Surgut Regional Clinical Hospital during the period from March to July 2020 underwent MSCT of the chest organs upon admission, before discharge, as well as in case of deterioration or lack of effect from the therapy — every 3 days. The detection of pathognomonic CT signs of COVID-19 in the lungs in patients with HIV (the nature of the lesion, the stage of the disease, the severity of the inflammatory process) was carried out in parallel with the diagnosis of opportunistic infections. During the examination, atypical clinical and X-ray morphological signs of the course of COVID-19/HIV coinfection were identified. In HIV-infected people, COVID-19 proceeds more easily and in disguise, while opportunistic infections both in clinical and radiological manifestations have priority signs.

Phylodynamic approaches are commonly used for RNA viruses harboring small genomes, but have only rarely been applied to DNA viruses with larger genomes. Here, we used the Pacific oyster mortality syndrome (POMS, a disease that affects oyster farms around the world) as a model to study the genetic diversity of its causative agent, the Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) in the three main French oyster-farming areas. Using ultra-deep sequencing on individual moribund oysters and new bioinformatics methodology, we de novo assembled 21 OsHV-1 new genomes. Combining quantification of major and minor variants, phylogenetic analysis and ancestral state reconstruction of discrete traits approaches; we assessed the connectivity of OsHV-1 viral populations between the three oyster-farming areas. Our results suggest that the Marennes-Oléron Bay represents the main source of OsHV-1 diversity, from where the virus has dispersed to other farming areas, a scenario consistent with current practices of oyster transfers in France. Here, we demonstrate that phylodynamic approaches can be applied to marine DNA viruses to determine how epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes act and potentially interact to shape their diversity patterns. Importance Phylogeography is a field of research that attempts to reconstruct the relationships between individual genotypes within a species and then correlate these genealogical relationships with their geographic and temporal origin. This field of research has become an essential step in the understanding of pandemics, in particular to determine the origin, spread and evolution of a pathogen as currently illustrated in studies on viral pandemics. However, because phylogeographic analyses are based on genome variation, stable genomes yield less information than labile genomes. Accordingly, viruses with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genomes generally have lower nucleotide diversity than RNA viruses. In this study, by combining the use of both major and minor variants with phylogeographic analyses of the oyster herpesvirus OsHV-1, we highlight genealogical relationships that have not been depicted in phylogenetic trees based on consensus viral genomes only. These data offer a plausible scenario reflecting the origin and spread of OsHV-1 populations between oyster-farming sites.","Delmotte, Jean; Pelletier, Camille; Morga, Benjamin; Galinier, Richard; Jacquot, Maude; Petton, Bruno; Lamy, Jean-Baptiste; Kaltz, Oliver; Avarre, Jean-Christophe; Montagnani, Caroline; Escoubas, Jean-Michel",bioRxiv,100,1

Despite the propensity for information communication and technology to enhance the teaching and learning process, the acceptance or rejection of learning technology is essential. Technological acceptance model (TAM) has evolved to become a key model to depict the predictors of human behaviour towards prospective rejection or acceptance of technology (Granic and Marangunic, 2019). In their recent systematic review of the extensive literature on TAM, Granic and Marangunic (2019) found that most of TAM research originate from Asia (Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea and China), Europe, North America, Middle East and Africa. To the best of the authors' knowledge, research on TAM has been very scarce in small island economies. This study aims to guide the empirical model of Al-Fraihat et al. (2020), which wants to uncover the quality of learning by understanding the intentions and satisfaction of tertiary education learners on the acceptance and use of information technology (IT) for e-learning, during the confinement period. Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a quantitative approach. The proposed framework was borrowed from Al-Fraihat et al. (2020) and amended based on the contextual aspect of the study. The model proposed by Al-Fraihat et al. (2020) takes into consideration the quality of e-learning through technical system quality, information quality, service quality, educational system quality, support system quality, learner quality and instructor quality. The framework has as the basis the TAM where the perceived satisfaction, perceived usefulness, use and benefits of E-learning have been evaluated. This current study evaluated the quality of the e-learning platform from the students' perspective in the confinement period. The service quality construct has been broken into three different dimensions, namely, service quality from an IT perspective, service quality from an administration perspective and service quality from the faculty represented by the Head of Departments. Another dimension has been added so as to evaluate the learner's point of view when studying during confinement, namely, confinement and learning quality. Findings The findings of this study did not support H25, that is the hypothesis that perceived usefulness has a positive relationship with perceived satisfaction, in contradiction to similar previous studies that confirmed the relationship (Al-Sabawy et al., 2011;Al-Fraihat et al., 2020). However, interestingly, the findings of this research supported the relationship between perceived satisfaction and benefits (H26). This means that the greater the satisfaction of the learner, the greater the benefits on students. The results of this study further supported that there is a positive relationship between perceived usefulness and benefits (H27);there is a positive relationship between perceived usefulness and use (H28);and finally, there is a positive relationship between use and benefits (H29). Such relationships were also found in the existing literature (Al-Sabawy et al., 2011;Cidral et al., 2018;Al-Fraihat et al., 2020). The perception of the usefulness of the e-learning system determines the benefits, usefulness and system use. When the learners feel that the system is enhancing their learning, learning activities and performance, hence learning more effectively, they tend to see the e-learning system as useful and they are more likely to use the e-learning system/tool. The use of the tool/system, thus positively impacts the benefits that the learners derived from the system. Originality/value The COVID-19 and overnight decision for a country-wide lockdown drastically changed the education sector. School and all teaching institutions were closed. However, most universities had to review their teaching and learning models to introduce e-learning to ensure the semester's progress. Hence, the use of the various LMS tools became a necessity overnight. This study on e-learning in Mauritius uses the TAM as the theoretical foundation because the theory has long been extensively used to investigate the quality of learning eg. Davis (1989), Scherer et al. (2019), Al-Fraihat et al. (2020).","Rughoobur-Seetah, S.; Hosanoo, Z. A.",Quality Assurance in Education,100,24

However, worries about adverse effects have led to vaccine hesitancy in some people. On the other hand, as COVID-19 may be associated with a range of sequelae, it is possible that vaccines may protect against hospitalization and mortality of various diseases. Methods We leveraged a large prospective cohort, the UK-Biobank (UKBB), and studied associations of at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination (BioNTech BNT162b2 or Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) with hospitalization and mortalities from cardiovascular and other diseases (N=180,727). Multivariable Cox and Poisson regression was conducted controlling for main confounders. For hospitalizations, we also conducted separate analysis for new-onset and recurrent cases. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality were also included as outcome. Results We observed that COVID-19 vaccination (at least one dose) was associated with lower risks of hospitalizations from stroke (hazard ratio [HR]=0.371, 95% CI: 0.254-0.543, p=3.36e-7), venous thromboembolism (VTE) (HR=0.485, 95% CI: 0.292-0.804, p=4.99e-3), dementia (HR=0.207, 95% CI 0.091-0.470; p=1.66e-4) and non-COVID-19 pneumonia (HR=0.482, 95% CI 0.313-0.742; p=9.18e-4). Regarding mortality, an association with lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was observed, as well as lower mortality from several diseases including stroke, coronary artery disease(CAD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and dementia. There is no evidence that vaccination was associated with increased hospitalization/fatality from any specific disorders. Conclusions Taken together, this study provides further support to the safety and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination, and such benefits may extend beyond reduction of infection risk or severity per se. As an observational study, causal relationship cannot be concluded and further studies are required to verify the findings.","XIANG, Y.; FENG, Y.; QIU, J.; So, H.-C.",,100,23

Neglected handover practice has been identified as a key component of poor outcomes in root cause analyses within the unit. There was no formal handover of patients between the incoming and outgoing medical teams. Resolution of this problem was tasked to the chief registrar (CR). As an obstetrics and gynaecology registrar in the CR role there were potential benefits and barriers to taking on a project in a different specialty.The information gathering occurred over six months (surveys, focus groups, incident reporting). The implementation coincided with the COVID-19 surge. All staff were notified of the finalised plans the week before handover was implemented and key staff were individually approached to be champions. Feedback was encouraged and actively sought to highlight teething problems.The results show a clear improvement in handover practice, junior doctor support and multi-professional team working. There had been resistance from some senior clinicians to attend an evening handover in the planning stages, however, implementing change at the height of the pandemic meant that staff had to adapt rapidly to new ways of working and as a result this change was widely accepted and implemented. The next stage is to incorporate more teaching into handover practice by including ‘teaching bites.’Upon starting the CR job this was presented as an unsolvable project. However, by a thorough analysis and formation of a plan for change with buy-in from the entire team we were able to affect a successful change. This demonstrates the value of seconding middle grade doctors to management roles as they can provide a crucial link between medical and management staff and coordinate vital change to improve patient safety.","Wienand-Barnett, S.; Markham, L.; Powell, R.; Jones, L.; Whitehead, T.; Webb, L.",BMJ Leader,100,5

These inter-individual allelic variants can be shared between or be specific to human populations. The current IG databases IMGT, VBASE2 and IgPdb hold information about germline alleles, most of which are partial sequences, obtained from a mixture of human (B-cell) samples, many with sequence errors and/or acquired (non-germline) IG variations, induced by somatic hypermutation (SHM) during antigen-specific B-cell responses. We systematically identified true germline alleles (without SHM) from 26 different human populations around the world, profiled by the “1000 Genomes data”. Our resource is uniquely enriched with complete IG allele sequences and their frequencies across human populations. We identified 409 IGHV, 179 IGKV, and 199 IGLV germline alleles supported by at least seven haplotypes (= minimum of four individuals), after removal of potential false-positives, based on using other genomic databases, i.e. ENSEMBL, TopMed, ExAC, ProjectMine. Remarkably, the positions of the identified variant nucleotides of the different alleles are not at random (as observed in case of SHM), but show striking patterns, restricted to limited nucleotide positions, the same as found in other IG data bases, suggesting over-time evolutionary selection processes. The identification of these specific patterns provides extra evidence that the identified variant nucleotides are not sequencing errors, but genuine allelic variants. The diversity of germline allelic variants in IGH and IGL loci is the highest in Africans, while the IGK locus is most diverse in Europeans. We also report on the presence of recombination signal sequences (RSS) in V pseudogenes, explaining their usage in V(D)J rearrangements. We propose that this new set of genuine germline IG sequences can serve as a new population-matched IG (pmIG) database for better understanding B-cell repertoire and B-cell receptor selection processes in disease and vaccination within and between different human populations. The database in format of fasta is available via GitHub (https://github.com/InduKhatri/pmIG). Contribution to the Field Statement We present a catalogue of immunoglobulin (IG) germline-alleles of unprecedented completeness and accuracy from 26 different human populations belonging to five different large ethnicities (Source: 1000 Genomes). We identified the population distribution of several known germline alleles and identified multiple new alleles, especially in African populations, indicative of high allelic diversity of IG genes in Africa. Strikingly, the identified variant nucleotides of the different alleles are not at random, but show striking patterns, restricted to limited nucleotide positions, the same as found in other IG databases, suggesting over-time evolutionary selection processes. Furthermore, we identified recombination signal sequences in pseudogenes (previously not known). We provide an overview of IG germline alleles shared with and between known databases and also point to potential sources of non-germline variation and incompleteness of the existing IG databases. More importantly, we believe that this information can serve as a novel population-matched IG (pmIG) database, highly valuable for the research community in supporting the dissection and understanding of differences in effectiveness of antibody-based immune responses in infectious diseases, other (immune) diseases and vaccination within and between human populations. Such knowledge might be used in developing population-specific vaccination strategies e.g. for currently ongoing SARS-CoV2 pandemic.","Khatri, Indu; Berkowska, Magdalena A.; van den Akker, Erik B.; Teodosio, Cristina; Reinders, Marcel J.T.; van Dongen, Jacques J.M.",bioRxiv,100,1

MethodsWe run a retrospective observational study with 249 COVID-19 patients admitted in Hospital del Mar. We have studied COVID-19 severity and progression attending to SZC at admission. In parallel we have studied SARS-CoV2 replication in the Vero E6 cell line modifying zinc concentrations. FindingsOur study demonstrates a correlation between serum zinc levels and COVID-19 outcome. Serum zinc levels lower than 50 {micro}g/dl at admission correlated with worse clinical presentation, longer time to reach stability and higher mortality.

In this model, ablation of Pten in the uterine epithelium leads to localized and distant malignant disease as observed in human EMC. We hypothesized that administering enzalutamide through the diet would temporarily decrease the incidence of invasive and metastatic carcinoma, while prolonged administration would result in development of resistance and loss of efficacy. Short-term treatment with enzalutamide reduced overall tumor burden through increased apoptosis but failed to prevent progression of invasive and metastatic disease. These results suggest that AR signaling may have biphasic, oncogenic and tumor suppressive roles in EMC that are dependent on disease stage. Enzalutamide treatment increased Progesterone Receptor (PR) expression within both stromal and tumor cell compartments. Prolonged administration of enzalutamide decreased apoptosis, increased tumor burden and resulted in the clonal expansion of tumor cells expressing high levels of p53 protein, suggestive of acquired Trp53 mutations. In conclusion, we show that enzalutamide induces apoptosis in EMC but has limited efficacy overall as a single agent. Induction of PR, a negative regulator of endometrial proliferation, suggests that adding progestin therapy to enzalutamide administration may further decrease tumor burden and result in a prolonged response.","Koivisto, Christopher S.; Parrish, Melodie; Bonala, Santosh B.; Ngoi, Soo; Torres, Adrian; Gallagher, James; Sanchez-Hodge, Rebekah; Zeinner, Victor; Nahhas, Georges J.; Liu, Bei; Cohn, David E.; Backes, Floor J.; Goodfellow, Paul J.; Chamberlin, Helen M.; Leone, Gustavo",bioRxiv,100,1

This study aims to examine COVID-19 vaccination rates among health care workers (HCWs) in Norway, according to immigrant background. Methods: We used individual-level, nation-wide registry data from Norway to identify all HCWs employed full-time at 1 December 2020. We examined the relationship between country of birth and COVID-19 vaccination from December 2020 to August 2021, both crude and adjusted for e.g. age, sex, municipality of residence, and detailed occupation codes in logistic regression models. Results: Among all HCWs in Norway, immigrants had a 9 percentage point lower vaccination rate (85%) than HCWs without an immigrant background (94%) at 31 August 2021. The overall vaccination rate varied by country of birth, with immigrants born in Russia (71%), Serbia (72%), Lithuania (72%), Romania (75%), Poland (76%), Eritrea (77%), and Somalia (78%) having the lowest crude vaccination rates. When we adjusted for demographics and detailed occupational codes, immigrant groups that more often worked as health care assistants, such as immigrants from Eritrea and Somalia, increased their vaccination rates. Conclusion: Substantial differences in vaccination rates among immigrant groups employed in the health care sector in Norway indicate that measures to improve vaccine uptake should focus specific immigrant groups rather than all immigrants together. Lower vaccination rates in some immigrant groups appears to be largely driven by the occupational composition, suggesting that some of the differences in vaccine rates can be attributed to variation in vaccine access.","Kraft, K.

Core genes are hypothesized to play a direct role in regulating disease; thus, their identification has the potential to reveal critical regulators and novel therapeutic targets. Here, we sought to identify genes with “core-like” characteristics for bone mineral density (BMD), one of the most significant predictors of osteoporotic fracture. This was accomplished by analyzing genome-wide association study (GWAS) data through the lens of a cell-type and timepoint-specific gene co-expression network for mineralizing osteoblasts. We identified a single co-expression network module that was enriched for genes implicated by GWAS and partitioned BMD heritability, correlated with in vitro osteoblast mineralization, and enriched for genes, which when mutated in humans or mice, led to a skeletal phenotype. Further characterization of this module identified four novel genes (B4GALNT3, CADM1, DOCK9, and GPR133) located within BMD GWAS loci with colocalizing expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and altered BMD in mouse knockouts, suggesting they are causal genetic drivers of BMD in humans. Our network-based approach identified a “core” module for BMD and provides a resource for expanding our understanding of the genetics of bone mass.","Sabik, Olivia L; Calabrese, Gina M; Taleghani, Eric; Ackert-Bicknell, Cheryl L; Farber, Charles R",bioRxiv,100,1

In this paper, we show how the action-oriented collaborative culture of complex and competitive economic ecosystems in places outside the major population centers may generate significant positive external effects for society and the environment at large. We illustrate this by means of two small case studies in Switzerland, a country with a federal system that enables decentralized economic development. The first case study investigates the economic ecosystem of the small town Monthey to show how productive migrants and embedded multinational companies increase the knowledge and know-how of local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The successful collaboration of insiders and outsiders accounts for the internal economic complexity that makes the region innovative and competitive. The second case study highlights the importance of the federalist system by showing how the canton of Solothurn succeeded in nurturing globally competitive export-oriented SMEs. We conclude that the success of these inclusive economic ecosystems in unexpected places may only be understood in the specific geographical, historical and political context, as well as the general openness of these regions toward entrepreneurial migrants and global business. The importance of local social capital makes it hard to replicate such success stories. Nevertheless, they indicate that the global knowledge economy may not just pose a threat, but also offer great opportunities for productive regions beyond the major global high-tech clusters of economic complexity.","Aerni, Philipp",Sustainability,100,1

Immunology research in non-traditional model organisms can be advantageous or even necessary (e.g. for host-pathogen interaction studies), but presents multiple challenges, many stemming from an incomplete understanding of potentially species-specific immune cell types, frequencies and phenotypes. Identifying and characterizing immune cells in such organisms is frequently limited by the availability of species-reactive immunophenotyping reagents for flow cytometry, and insufficient prior knowledge of cell type-defining markers. Here, we demonstrate the utility of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to characterize immune cells for which traditional experimental tools are limited. Specifically, we used scRNA-Seq to comprehensively define the cellular diversity of equine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy horses across different breeds, ages, and sexes. We identified 30 cell type clusters partitioned into five major populations: Monocytes/Dendritic Cells, B cells, CD3+PRF1+ lymphocytes, CD3+PRF1- lymphocytes, and Basophils. Comparative analyses revealed many cell populations analogous to human PBMC, including transcriptionally heterogeneous monocytes and distinct dendritic cell subsets (cDC1, cDC2, plasmacytoid DC). Unexpectedly, we found that a majority of the equine peripheral B cell compartment is comprised of T-bet+ B cells; an immune cell subpopulation typically associated with chronic infection and inflammation in human and mouse. Taken together, our results demonstrate the potential of scRNA-Seq for cellular analyses in non-traditional model organisms, and form the basis for an immune cell atlas of horse peripheral blood.","Patel, Roosheel S.; Tomlinson, Joy E.; Divers, Thomas J.; Van de Walle, Gerlinde R.; Rosenberg, Brad R.",bioRxiv,100,16

Methods: This study is a retrospective case-series of patients presenting to a single ED with acute symptomatic COVID-19 from March 7-August 9, 2020. Symptomatic patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were eligible for this study. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 due to screening tests but had no reasonably associated symptoms were excluded. Participants were analyzed by three categories representative of clinical severity: intensive care unit (ICU) care/death, general ward admission, and ED discharge/convalescence at home. Outcomes were ascertained 30 days after initial presentation to account for escalation in severity after the ED visit. We conducted univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses to report odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) between hospital or ICU care/death versus convalescence at home and between ICU care/death versus general ward admission. Results: In total, 994 patients were included in the study, of which, 551 (55.4%) patients convalesced at home, 314 (31.6%) patients required general ward admission, and 129 (13.0%) required ICU care or died. In the multivariable models, ED patients requiring hospital admission were more likely to be aged [≥] 65 years (adjusted OR [aOR] 7.4, 95% CI: 5.0, 10.8), Black/African American (aOR 3.0, 95% CI: 1.6, 5.8) or Asian/American Indian/Alaska Native/Other (aOR 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1, 4.3), and experience dyspnea (aOR 2.7, 95% CI: 2.0, 3.7) or diarrhea (aOR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.2).

An accurate prognosis prediction to effectively triage patients is needed, especially in the community oncology practice. Methods:Nationwide cohort from Oncoclínicas Brazil was used to validate previously developed multivariable logistic regression (mLR) model (Ferrari et al, JCO GO 2021) and to construct a machine learning Random Forest (RF) algorithm as predictor of 30-day mortality after SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR in cancer patients diagnosed in an outpatient setting. To find the most important baseline clinical determinants of early COVID19-related death via Gini index, a RF with 100,000 trees was trained in 75% of the dataset, and the performance was assessed in the remaining 25%. We then compared the accuracy of different models in terms of sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC). Results:From March to December 2020, 533 patients with COVID-19 were prospectively registered in the database. Median age was 60 years (19-93) and 67% were female. Most frequent cancers were breast in 34%, hematological in 16%, and gastrointestinal in 15%. Comorbidities were common (52%), as was current/former smoking history (17%). Most patients were on active systemic therapy or radiotherapy (84%) in the advanced or metastatic disease setting (55%). The overall mortality rate was 15% (CI95% 12%-18%). We validated the original mLR model trained in the first 198 patients: management in a noncurative setting (odds ratio [OR] 3.7), age ≥ 60 years (OR 2.3), and current/former smoking (OR 1.9) were significant predictors of death in the expanded cohort. Presence of comorbidities (OR 1.9) also defined poor outcome in the updated mLR model, which yielded low sensitivity (74%), specificity (68%) and AUC (0.78). With RF modeling, the most significant predictors of 30-day death after COVID-19 (in decreasing order) were older age, treatment of advanced or metastatic disease, tumor type (respiratory tract, brain and unknown primary cancers had higher mortality), COVID-related symptom burden at baseline evaluation and treatment regimen (immunotherapy combinations had higher mortality). The RF model demonstrated high sensitivity (89%), specificity (88%) and AUC (0.96). Conclusions:The results highlight the possibility that machine learning algorithms are able to predict early mortality after COVID-19 in cancer patients with high accuracy. The proposed prediction model may be helpful in the prompt identification of high-risk patients based on clinical features alone, without having to wait for the results of additional tests such as laboratory or radiologic studies. It can also help prioritize medical resources and redefine vaccination strategies. A web-based mortality risk calculator will be created for clinical decision support.","Dienstmann, R.; Menezes, M.; E Silva, M. C.; Cruz, H.; Paes, R.; Da Silva, J. A.; Messias, A. C.

This study aims to investigate health-related concerns, health-related quality of life and psychological adjustment in patients with congenital heart disease compared to healthy peers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: One-hundred patients with congenital heart disease and 50 controls (M = 29.7, SD = 3.8 years) were recruited. They completed an online survey including the assessment of health-related concerns regarding COVID-19, the 12-item Short Form Health Survey and the Brief Symptom Inventory. Results: Patients considered COVID-19 to be a more serious issue (Generalized odds ratio [GenOR] = 1.67, p = 0.04), were more concerned about becoming infected (GenOR = 2.93, p <0.001)and expressed more fear about leaving their homes (GenOR = 1.81, p = 0.004) while general anxiety symptoms were not different between groups (p = 0.23). Patients relied more on family and friends for support (30% vs. 2% in controls, p < 0.001) and reported better compliance with protective measures (p =0.03).Mental health-related quality of life and psychological adjustment were not different between groups (p =0.17andp = 0.68, respectively). Physical health-related quality of life was lower in patients compared to controls (p =0.03).Conclusions: Young adults with congenital heart disease in Switzerland are more concerned about their health during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to healthy peers. These concerns, however, do not translate into generally impaired mental well-being. The impact of the easing of lockdown measures on long-term anxiety levels and quality of life requires further study.","Wehrle, F. M.; Landolt, M.

Reduced income, job insecurity, distribution system interruptions, product shortages, localized price hikes, and time availability resulted in changes in food-related behaviors of households, including food waste generation. Although the significant progress achieved in the understanding of the multidimensional determinants of food losses and waste, no study has been considering the role of uncertainty generated by exogenous generalized shocks on consumer behavior. Building on an original and nationally representative survey, this work aims to investigate the impact of the measures introduced to contain the outbreak of COVID-19 on the main behavioral factors underpinning household food waste generation. The study develops a theoretical model introducing uncertainty validated through a Structural Equations Modelling approach. Results showed that during the quarantine period declared household food waste decreased, with more than half of the respondents reporting to waste less. The model suggested that the amount of material and non-material resources that consumers can dedicate to food-related activities represents the most influential factor for the generation of household food waste and that uncertainty is significantly affecting the drivers and indirectly influencing the self-declared values of food waste. Results suggest several potential policy implications, of which the most relevant being related to the importance of stimulating improvements in food management opportunities at home. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Vittuari, M.; Masotti, M.; Iori, E.; Falasconi, L.; Gallina Toschi, T.; Segrè, A.","Resources, Conservation and Recycling",100,28

Both the anxiety over COVID-19 and the risk of job insecurity have affected the employees’ economic and social conditions as well as their mental state. The present study examined the effect of COVID-19 anxiety and job insecurity perceptions on the burnout levels of hotel-sector employees and the moderator role of the employees’ financial well-being on this relationship. The study was conducted by collecting data from 396 participants who worked in 17 different five-star hotels in Antalya, Turkey. Because of social isolation and social distancing rules, our research data were obtained using an online questionnaire to avoid close contact with other people. The findings showed that COVID-19 anxiety and perceptions of job insecurity had negative effects on hotel employees in the form of mental burnout. In addition, we determined that as an individual characteristic, financial well-being was a moderator variable that affected the severity of burnout based on COVID-19 anxiety and job insecurity. The research findings exhibited theoretical and practical contributions for decision makers and researchers.","Uuml,; ngüren, Engin Tekin Ömer Akgün Avsallı Hüseyin Kaçmaz Yaşar Yiğit",Sustainability,100,22

Furthermore, the COVID-19 is accelerating this necessity. In fact, the health emergency has affected almost all sectors, determining radical change in economic and social systems. Tourism and culture are among those most affected and therefore they require strategies to support their recovery and to strengthen their resilience for the future. The closure of cultural venues has highlighted the importance of finding alternative ways to join cultural heritage and to allow it continuing to develop its productive potential. In this context, the importance of the opportunities offered by digital technologies for conservation, valorization and enjoyment of cultural heritage has emerged. This study proposes the circular city as a new urban development model to achieve a more sustainable future, focusing in particular on cultural heritage as an entry point to implement this model.

In our study, a total of 38,911 individuals (61% female, 15% over 65) have been enrolled between March 25, 2020 and April 3, 2021, with 1,118 reported testing positive and 7,032 negative for COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal PCR swab test. We propose an explainable gradient boosting prediction model based on decision trees for the detection of COVID-19 infection that can adapt to the absence of self-reported symptoms and to the available sensor data, and that can explain the importance of each feature and the post-test-behavior for the individuals. We tested it in a cohort of symptomatic individuals who exhibited an AUC of 0.83 [0.81-0.85], or AUC=0.78 [0.75-0.80] when considering only data before the test date, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithm in these conditions. The analysis of all individuals (including asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic) when self-reported symptoms were excluded provided an AUC of 0.78 [0.76-0.79], or AUC of 0.70 [0.69-0.72] when considering only data before the test date.

Public health measures, such as prolonged periods of social isolation, unexpected employment disruptions, school closures, financial distress, and changes to routine, are having an unprecedented negative impact on mental well-being. Unaddressed stress and burnout can lead to depression, suicidal ideation and substance abuse. We conducted a review of the literature (a) to synthesize the common triggers of stress, burnout and depression faced by HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic and (b) to identify interventions at the individual, organizational and systemic levels that can support the well-being of HCWs during a pandemic.A systematic search of literature databases was conducted from 2003 to June 2020. We included review articles that reported on stress, burnout and depression in HCWs;that primarily focused on women;and that included the percentage or number of women surveyed.Of the 2,803 papers found, 31 were included. Our preliminary findings show that HCWs are at increased risk for stress, burnout and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative outcomes are triggered by individual-level factors such as gender, family status and lack of social support;organizational-level factors such as high workload and access to PPE;, and systemic-level factors such as prevalence of COVID-19, rapidly changing public health guidelines and a lack of recognition at work. There is a limited amount of evidence on effective interventions that prevent anxiety, stress, burnout and depression during a pandemic. Preliminary findings of causes of increased stress and mental health issues suggest possible strategies healthcare organizations can use to address modifiable factors such as ongoing training to increase confidence in caring for COVID-19 patients, clear infection control guidelines and sufficient PPE and optimization of working conditions for HCWs.","Sriharan, Abi Ratnapalan Savithiri Lupea Doina Tricco Andrea",BMJ Leader,100,1

Here, we present LinQ-View, a toolkit designed for multimodal single-cell data visualization and analysis. LinQ-View integrates transcriptional and cell surface protein expression profiling data to reveal more accurate cell heterogeneity and proposes a quantitative metric for cluster purity assessment. Through comparison with existing multimodal methods on multiple public CITE-seq datasets, we demonstrate that LinQ-View efficiently generates accurate cell clusters, especially in CITE-seq data with routine numbers of surface protein features, by preventing variations in a single surface protein feature from affecting results. Finally, we utilized this method to integrate single-cell transcriptional and protein expression data from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, revealing antigen-specific B cell subsets after infection. Our results suggest LinQ-View could be helpful for multimodal analysis and purity assessment of CITE-seq datasets that target specific cell populations (e.g., B cells).","Li, Lei Dugan Haley L.; Stamper, Christopher T.; Lan, Linda Yu-Ling Asby Nicholas W.; Knight, Matthew Stovicek Olivia Zheng Nai-Ying Madariaga Maria Lucia Shanmugarajah Kumaran Jansen Maud O.; Changrob, Siriruk Utset Henry A.; Henry, Carole Nelson Christopher Jedrzejczak Robert P.; Fremont, Daved H.; Joachimiak, Andrzej Krammer Florian Huang Jun Khan Aly A.; Wilson, Patrick C.",Cell Reports Methods,100,24

Objective The aim of this study was to analyze the seroconversion rate in cancer patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Materials and Methods We retrospectively analyzed antibody levels and seroconversion rates in serum samples from 135 cancer patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Chemiluminescent immunoassay using Roche Cobas e801 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) was performed to identify Pan Ig antibody against nucleocapsid antigen. Reports of first, third, and sixth month were analyzed. Seroconversion was also compared with health-care workers (HCW) of our institute who had recovered from COVID-19 infection. Results Seroconversion rate in cancer patients was 81.2% at 1 month, 95% at 3 months, and 94.6% at 6 months post reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction positivity. There was no difference in seroconversion rate among different age groups, gender, comorbidities, severity of COVID-19 symptoms, cancer disease status, and treatment with chemotherapy. Seroconversion rate in cancer patients is comparable to HCW (90.4 vs. 96%, p = 0.82) and is durable. Conclusion Humoral response to COVID-19 infection in cancer patients is comparable to general population and sustained. Such responses suggest that cancer patients are likely to benefit from COVID-19 vaccination.","Agarwal, A.; Baghmar, S.; Qureshi, S.; Khurana, A.; Setia, R.; Khan, M. A.; Barman, P.; Kapoor, R.

COVID 19 has led to educational gathering restrictions for both medical students (MS) and Physician Assistant students (PAS). In response, we offered MS and PAS education through a virtual HFS (VS) experience. Study Objective: To determine the perceived educational efficacy of VS. Methods: This IRB reviewed study was conducted by a PGY 1-4 EM residency. Given COVID restrictions, virtual clerkship educational experiences, including VS were created. VS was conducted via WebEX TM. Previous in person HFS cases were streamed by on site personnel, including faculty and chief residents Student leaders were assisted by teammates via chat in teams of 3. Students had a minimum of 3 VS. After rotation completion, either full virtual (FV) or patient care with virtual education (PC), MS and PAS were asked to provide anonymous feedback. The electronic survey consisted of the host network’s standard Continuing Medical Education (CME) questions (Table 1). The Likert questions were analyzed descriptively with a value of 1 for Strongly Disagree (SD), 2 Disagree (D), 3 Undecided (U), 4 Agree (A), and 5 Strongly Agree (SA). Open ended questions were qualitatively analyzed. Results: From 8/3/20-10/23/20, 79 students (58 FV, 19 PC) rotated. Due to scheduling conflicts, 14 were unable to participate leaving 65 VS participants (44 FV, 21 PC). A total of 46 replied (70.8% response rate). Table 1 demonstrates that VS was received overwhelmingly positively. Only 1 respondent replied that they would not recommend this activity to others. Positives include perceived realism, experience, and teamwork. Ability to view the monitor was a theme for improvement. Conclusions: This single site cohort indicates that VS is an effective, well received education tool for students unable to access a sim center. Further research is needed to compare VS to an in-person simulation experience. [Formula presented]","Paulson, C.; Allen, J.; Davis, J.; Fritzges, J. A.; Jayant, D. A.; Nguyen, M. C.; Urban, C.

Altice, MD",13.469698,5.992391,2021-03-31,"Many viral proteins, including multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins, are secreted via the endoplasmic reticulum, and viral particles are assembled and exported in ER-associated replication compartments. Viral coat proteins such as the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein are N-glycosylated at NxS/T sites as they enter the ER. N-glycosylated sites in many eukaryotic proteins are deglycosylated by the NGLY1/PNG-1 deglycosylation enzyme which also deamidates the N-glycosylated asparagine to aspartic acid, thus editing the target protein sequence. Proteomic analysis of mammalian cell lines has revealed deamidation of many host N-glycosylated asparagines to aspartic acid by NGLY1/PNG-1 on peptides that are presented by mammalian HLA for immune surveillance. The key client protein for NGLY1/PNG-1 deglycosylation and N to D protein editing was revealed by genetic analysis of C. elegans proteasome regulation to be the intact endoplasmic reticulum-transiting SKN-1A transcription factor. Strikingly, an analysis of cancer cell genetic dependencies for growth revealed that the mammalian orthologue of SKN-1A, NRF1 (also called NFE2L1) is required by a highly correlated set of cell lines as NGLY1/PNG-1, supporting that NGLY1/PNG-1 and NRF1 act in the same pathway. NGLY1/PNG-1 edits N-glycosylated asparagines on the intact SKN-1 protein as it is retrieved by ERAD from the ER to in turn activate the transcription of target proteasomal genes. The normal requirement for NGLY1/PNG-1 editing of SKN-1A can be bypassed by a genomic substituion of N to D in four NxS/T N-glycosylation motifs of SKN-1A. Thus NGLY1/PNG-1-mediated N to D protein editing is more than a degradation step for the key client protein for proteasomal homeostasis in C. elegans or tumor growth in particular mammalian cell lines, SKN-1A/NRF1. In addition, such N to D substitutions in NxS/T N-glycosylation motifs occur in evolution: N to D substitutions are observed in phylogenetic comparisons of SKN-1A between nematode species that diverged hundreds of millions of years ago or of the vertebrate NRF1 between disparate vertebrates. Genomic N to D mutations bypass the many steps in N-glycosylation in the ER and deglycosylation-based editing of N to D, perhaps based on differences in the competency of divergent species for various N-glycosylation or deglycosylation steps. We surveyed the N-glycosylation sites in coronavirus proteins for such phylogenetic evidence for N to D protein editing in viral life cycles, and found evidence for preferential N to D residue substitutions in NxS/T N-glycosylation sites in comparisons of the genome sequences of hundreds of coronaviruses. This suggests that viruses use NGLY1/PNG-1 in some hosts, for example humans, to edit particular N-glycosylated residues to aspartic acid, but that in other hosts, often in bats, an N to D substitution mutation in the virus genome is selected. Single nucleotide mutations in Asp or Asn codons can produce viruses with N to D or D to N substitutions that might be selected in different animal hosts from the population of viral variants produced in any previous host. NGLY1/PNG-1 has been implicated in viral immunity in mammalian cell culture, favoring this hypothesis. Because of the phylogenetic evidence that the NGLY1/PNG-1 editing of protein sequences has functional importance for SKN-1A/NRF1 and viruses, and because most immunization protocols do not address the probable editing and functional importance of N-glycosylated aspargines to aspartic acid in normal viral infections, we suggest that immunization with viral proteins engineered to substitute D at genomically encoded NxS/T sites of N-glycosylated viral proteins that show a high frequency of N to D substitution in viral phylogeny may enhance immunological response to peptide antigens. Such genomically-edited peptides would not require ER-localization for N-glycosylation or other cell compartment localization for NGLY1/PNG-1 N to D protein editing. In addition, such N to D edited protein vaccines could be produced in bacteria since N-glycosylation and deglycosylation which do not occur in bacteria would no longer be required to immunize with a D-substituted peptide. Bacterially-expressed vaccines would be much lower cost and with fewer failure modes than attenuated viral vaccines or recombinant animal viruses produced in chicken eggs, mammalian tissue culture cells, or delivered by mRNA vectors to the patient directly. Because N to D edited peptides are clearly produced by NGLY1/PNG-1, and may be and presented by mammalian HLA, such peptides may more robustly activate T-cell killing or B-cell maturation to mediate more robust viral immunity.","Ruvkun, Gary; Ji, Fei; Sadreyev, Ruslan I.",bioRxiv,100,1

This study examined the effects of this transition to Emergency Remote Instruction (ERI) at six institutions in Georgia, using a survey completed by 910 instructors who made that transition in at least one course in the Spring term of 2020. 65% of the instructors taught remotely or online for the first time after the transition. Instructors reported accessing a variety of institutional, collegial, and internet resources to aid in the transition, leading 53.4% of them to express that they were adequately prepared for ERI. Once classes resumed online, instructors found themselves to be needing much more time for remote instruction than their previous F2F instruction.

To help address these disparities, clinicians need to understand the specific health challenges faced by black COVID patients compared to their white counterparts. These challenges are understudied in the oncologic setting. Hence, we present the demographic and clinical features of black COVID-positive cancer patients compared to whites. Methods: We used ConcertAI's database of oncology EMR data, which includes clinical data from CancerLinQ Discovery. We conducted twosample t-tests and chi-squared tests to measure the differences in black and white COVIDpositive cancer patients across age, gender, ethnicity, state, region, ECOG, BMI, all cancer indications, stage, and Charlson comorbidities. COVID positivity was defined using claims data. Only relevant significant results are reported to save space. Results: Table summarizes the differences in 429 black and 980 white cancer patients with COVID. Black patients were younger, more likely to have an elevated BMI, and have a higher prevalence of breast cancer, congestive heart failure, diabetes, multiple myeloma, peptic ulcer disease, and renal disease. They also had less melanoma. Results were statistically significant at 0.05 level. Analyzing only black patients by COVID status shows very similar results. Conclusions: Black cancer patients suffer from multiple comorbid conditions that increase their risk of adverse outcomes when infected with COVID-19. The CDC lists eight comorbidities that put patients at a higher risk of severe COVID infection. Black patients in our cohort have a higher prevalence of four out of eight of these conditions- elevated BMI, renal disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes.

Design and participants: Cross-sectional survey of 15,641 children aged 7-10 years in the Born in Bradford Primary School Years study: whole-classroom samples in 89 Bradford primary schools between 2016 and 2019. Main outcome measures: Prevalence estimates by ethnicity (%, 95% CI) of single and multiple vulnerabilities in child wellbeing within and across four domains (home, family, relationships; material resources; friends and school; subjective wellbeing). Results Only 10% of children have no vulnerabilities in any domain of wellbeing; 10% have one or more vulnerabilities in all four domains. The highest prevalence estimates were for being bullied some or all of the time (52.7%, 51.9 to 53.4%), keeping worries to oneself (31.2%, 30.5 to 31.9%), having no park near home (30.8%, 30.1 to 31.5%) and worrying all the time about how much money their family has (26.3%, 25.6 to 27%). Boys were consistently significantly more likely than girls to report all of the vulnerabilities in the Home, Family and Family Relationships domain, and the majority of indicators in the other domains, and in all domains except Friends and School, boys were significantly more likely to have at least one vulnerability. Girls were significantly more likely to report not having many friends (16.7%, 95% CI: 15.9 to 17.6% vs. 12.5%, 95% CI: 11.8 to 13.2%), being bullied some or all of the time (55.8%, 95% CI: 54.7 to 56.9% vs. 49.7%, 95% CI: 48.6 to 50.8%) and feeling left out all the time (12.1%, 95% CI: 11.4 to 12.8%) vs. 10.3%, 95% CI: 9.7 to 11.0%). Variations in vulnerabilities by ethnicity were complex, with children in Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic groups sometimes reporting more vulnerabilities and sometimes fewer than White British children. For example, compared to children of Pakistani heritage, White British children were more likely to say that their family never gets along well (6.3%,5.6 to 7.1% vs. 4.1%,3.6 to 4.6%) and to have no access to the internet at home (22.3%,21 to 23.6% vs. 18%,17 to 18.9%). Children with Pakistani heritage were more likely than White British children to say they had no park near their home where they can play with friends (32.7%,31.6 to 33.9% vs. 29.9%,28.6 to 31.3%), to report not having three meals a day (17.9%,16.9 to 18.8% vs. 11.9%,10.9 to 12.9%) and to worry all the time about how much money their families have (29.3%,28.2 to 30.3%) vs. 21.6%,20.4 to 22.9%). Gypsy/Irish Traveller children were less likely than White British children to say they were bullied some or all of the time (42.2%,35.4 to 49.4% vs. 53.8%,52.3 to 55.3%), but more likely to say they were mean to others all the time (9.9%,6.3 to 15.2% vs. 4%,3.5 to 4.7%) and can never work out what to do when things are hard (15.2%,10.6 to 21.2% vs. 9%, 8.2 to 9.9%). We considered six vulnerabilities to be of particular concern during the current Covid-19 pandemic and associated national and local lockdowns: family never gets along well together; no garden where child can play; no nearby park where they can play; not having 3 meals a day; no internet at home; worried about money all the time. Pre-pandemic, 37.4% (36.6 to 38.3%) of Bradford children had one of these vulnerabilities and a further 29.6% (28.9 to 30.4%) had more than one. Conclusions Although most primary school children aged 7-10 in our study have good levels of wellbeing on most indicators across multiple domains, fewer than 10% have no vulnerabilities at all, a worrying 10% have at least one vulnerability in all the four domains we studied and two thirds have vulnerabilities of concern during the Covid-19 lockdowns.","Pickett, K.

Methods: Spike-binding antibody and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody levels elicited by a single-dose Ad26.COV2.S (5x1010 viral particles [vp]) primary regimen and booster doses (5x1010 vp and 1.25x1010 vp) were assessed by ELISA and wild-type VNA in sera from participants in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial (Cohort 1a, 18-55 years old, N=25; Cohort 2a, 18-55 years old boosted at 6 months, N=17; Cohort 3, [≥]65 years old, N=22) and a Phase 2 clinical trial (18-55 and [≥]65-year old participants boosted at 6 months, total N=73). Neutralizing antibody levels were determined approximately 8 months after the primary vaccination in participants aged 18-55 years and approximately 9 months in participants aged [≥]65 years. Binding antibody levels were evaluated 6 months after primary vaccination and 7- and 28-days after booster doses in both age groups. Results: A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S elicited neutralizing antibodies that remained largely stable for approximately 8-9 months and binding antibodies that remained stable for at least 6 months irrespective of age group. A 5x1010 vp booster dose at 6 months post prime vaccination in 18-55-year-old adults elicited a steep and robust 9-fold increase at Day 7 post boost compared to Day 29 levels following the initial immunization. A lower booster dose of 1.25x1010 vp at 6 months in adults 18-55 and [≥]65 years of age also elicited a rapid and high increase of 6-7.7 fold at Day 28 post boost compared to Day 29 levels following the initial immunization, with similar magnitude of post-boost responses in both age groups. Conclusions: A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S, which demonstrated protection in a Phase 3 efficacy trial, elicited durable neutralizing and binding antibodies for at least 8 and 6 months, respectively, in adults >18 years of age at levels similar to Day 29 responses. A 5x1010 vp or 1.25x1010 vp booster dose at 6 months elicited rapid and robust increases in spike binding antibody levels.

To reduce disease transmission, policymakers can enforce reduced crowding and mandate wearing of masks. \emph{Cohorting} -- forming groups of travelers that always travel together, is an additional policy to reduce disease transmission on \textit{locals} without severe restrictions. Cohorting allows us to: ($i$) form traveler bubbles, thereby decreasing the number of distinct interactions over time; ($ii$) potentially quarantine an entire cohort if a single case is detected, making contact tracing more efficient, and ($iii$) target cohorts for testing and early detection of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic cases. Studying impact of cohorts using compartmental models is challenging because of the ensuing representational complexity. Agent-based models provide a natural way to represent cohorts along with the representation of the cohort members with the larger social network. This paper describes a novel multi-scale agent-based model to study the impact of cohorting strategies on COVID-19 dynamics in Mumbai. We achieve this by modeling the Mumbai urban region using a detailed agent-based model comprising of 12.4 million agents. Individual cohorts and their inter-cohort interactions as they travel on locals are modeled using local mean field approximations. The resulting multi-scale model in conjunction with a detailed disease transmission and intervention simulator is used to assess various cohorting strategies. The results provide a quantitative trade-off between cohort size and its impact on disease dynamics and well being. The results show that cohorts can provide significant benefit in terms of reduced transmission without significantly impacting ridership and or economic \& social activity.","Talekar, Alok; Shriram, Sharad; Vaidhiyan, Nidhin; Aggarwal, Gaurav; Chen, Jiangzhuo; Venkatramanan, Srini; Wang, Lijing; Adiga, Aniruddha; Sadilek, Adam; Tendulkar, Ashish; Marathe, Madhav; Sundaresan, Rajesh; Tambe, Milind",ArXiv,100,21

The conclusion is that immunomodulation through infection of alveolar macrophages is likely to occur, but that it is transient and at a local level, in the lung. There is some evidence for more subtle effects via more disseminated replication or induction of apoptosis with some isolates, but more definitive studies are needed. There is some emerging evidence of interaction between PRRSV and different cells of the immune system, but its significance for the course of disease or pig health are unclear. Likewise, the current experimental evidence for any interaction of PRRSV with other pathogens is ambiguous and therefore no firm conclusions can yet be drawn. Strains of PRRSV do vary in pathogenicity, which may be related to their degree of ability to cause overt respiratory disease in the absence of other agents. Experimentally, varying degrees of interstitial pneumonia are a common histological finding. There is, as yet, no firm evidence of general immunosuppression--in fact, some contrary evidence exists in the form of observations of a transient enhancement of humoral response, possibly through polyclonal B cell activation. The basis of pathogenicity of PRRSV and of any interaction with other agents is still unknown and is likely to remain unclear. Virus interaction with the pig's immune system must be addressed before any assessment of virulence of any known or emergent strains of PRRSV can be made.","Drew, T W",Veterinary research,100,17

However, ample evidence derived from studies ranging from animal experiments to extensive clinical trials supports a crucial role for respiratory viruses in the etiology and pathogenesis of acute otitis media. Viral infection of the upper respiratory mucosa initiates the whole cascade of events that finally leads to the development of acute otitis media as a complication. The pathogenesis of acute otitis media involves a complex interplay between viruses, bacteria, and the host's inflammatory response. In a substantial number of children, viruses can be found in the middle-ear fluid either alone or together with bacteria, and recent studies indicate that at least some viruses actively invade the middle ear. Viruses appear to enhance the inflammatory process in the middle ear, and they may significantly impair the resolution of otitis media. Prevention of the predisposing viral infection by vaccination against the major viruses would probably be the most effective way to prevent acute otitis media. Alternatively, early treatment of the viral infection with specific antiviral agents would also be effective in reducing the occurrence of acute otitis media.","Heikkinen, Terho; Chonmaitree, Tasnee",Clinical microbiology reviews,100,26

In this study, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated the interaction between a partially purified recombinant NS5B protein and a 3' viral genomic RNA with or without the conserved 98-nucleotide tail. The NS5B-RNA complexes were specifically competed away by the unlabeled homologous RNA but not by the viral 5' noncoding region and very poorly by the 3' conserved 98-nucleotide tail. A 3' coding region with conserved stem-loop structures rather than the 3' noncoding region of the HCV genome is critical for the specific binding of NS5B. Nevertheless, no direct interaction between the 3' coding region and the HCV NS5A protein was detected. Furthermore, two independent RNA-binding domains (RBDs) of NS5B were identified, RBD1, from amino acid residues 83 to 194, and RBD2, from residues 196 to 298. Interestingly, the conserved motifs of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for putative RNA binding (220-DxxxxD-225) and template/primer position (282-S/TGxxxTxxxNS/T-292) are present in the RBD2.

A single intranasal administration of BHPIV3 expressing the SARS-CoV spike protein (S) induced a high titer of SARS-CoV-neutralizing serum antibodies, only 2-fold less than that induced by SARS-CoV infection. The expression of S with the two other putative virion envelope proteins, the matrix M and small envelope E proteins, did not augment the neutralizing antibody response. In absence of S, expression of M and E or the nucleocapsid protein N did not induce a detectable serum SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibody response. Immunization with BHPIV3 expressing S provided complete protection against SARS-CoV challenge in the lower respiratory tract and partial protection in the upper respiratory tract. This was augmented slightly by coexpression with M and E. Expression of M, E, or N in the absence of S did not confer detectable protection. These results identify S among the structural proteins as the only significant SARS-CoV neutralization antigen and protective antigen and show that a single mucosal immunization is highly protective in an experimental animal that supports efficient replication of SARS-CoV.","Buchholz, Ursula J; Bukreyev, Alexander; Yang, Lijuan; Lamirande, Elaine W; Murphy, Brian R; Subbarao, Kanta; Collins, Peter L",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,100,1

The mass migration during the Hajj is unparalleled in scale, and pilgrims face numerous health hazards. The extreme congestion of people and vehicles during this time amplifies health risks, such as those from infectious diseases, that vary each year. Since the Hajj is dictated by the lunar calendar, which is shorter than the Gregorian calendar, it presents public-health policy planners with a moving target, demanding constant preparedness. We review the communicable and non-communicable hazards that pilgrims face. With the rise in global travel, preventing disease transmission has become paramount to avoid the spread of infectious diseases, including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), avian influenza, and haemorrhagic fever. We examine the response of clinicians, the Saudi Ministry of Health, and Hajj authorities to these unique problems, and list health recommendations for prospective pilgrims.","Ahmed, Qanta A; Arabi, Yaseen M; Memish, Ziad A",Lancet,100,22

The purpose of this survey was to evaluate the use of the diet worldwide. METHODS With the use of the Internet, e-mail requests for information about international ketogenic diet centers (outside the United States) were made over a 9-month period. Assistance also was obtained from the Child Neurology Society and International League Against Epilepsy. Questions included patient enrollment (total and annually), year the diet was first offered, unique cultural and religious issues in the country, community opinion, and research interests. RESULTS Successful communication was made with 73 academic centers in 41 countries outside the United States. Sixteen (39%) countries provided information from multiple centers. The median duration offering the diet was 8 years (range, 1-45 years). The average number of patients enrolled to date was 71.6 per country, with 5.4 new patients annually. Common difficulties included avoiding rice intake, tolerating higher fat-to-protein and carbohydrate ratios (e.g., 4:1), finding specific nutritional labels on foods, and handling the growing interest from large populations with limited resources. Nevertheless, cultural and religious issues were generally not limiting; physician and patient acceptance of the diet as an option is high; and most meals were similar among countries. Centers often had great pride in their programs, and international collaborative groups are forming rapidly. A website is now available with updated center information at http://www.neuro.jhmi.edu/Epilepsy/Peds/ketoworldwide.htm CONCLUSIONS Despite occasional difficulties, the ketogenic diet is being used worldwide.","Kossoff, Eric H; McGrogan, Jane R",Epilepsia,100,5

The bronchial epithelium is the first cell layer of contact with the environment and as such is an especially attractive target in which to identify novel mechanisms and new therapeutic strategies in disease development. We discuss the role of epithelial injury and wound repair in the origins of asthma. RECENT FINDINGS The presence of inflammation, thickening of the basement membrane and angiogenesis have been described in bronchial biopsies from asthmatic children. We and others have demonstrated the utility of bronchial brushings from children for the isolation, characterization and culture of primary epithelial cells. The results of these experiments suggest that intrinsic differences exist between asthmatic and nonasthmatic epithelial cells. SUMMARY It is becoming increasingly clear from studies involving adults and, more recently, children, that the epithelium orchestrates inflammatory and remodeling responses of the airway. Equally clear is that the asthmatic epithelium responds inappropriately to challenge and displays signs of dysregulated repair. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms involved in these processes, including the role of resident/recruited progenitor cells, is crucial if we are to halt the progression of asthma when the disease first manifests in childhood.","Hackett, Tillie-Louise; Knight, Darryl A",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,100,4

The hospital reported this occurrence to the local center for disease control (CDC), which lead Wuhan CDC staff to initiate a field investigation with a retrospective search for pneumonia patients. On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was alerted by the Chinese authorities for several cases of pneumonia of unknown origin in the City of Wuhan. On January 7, 2020, a novel virus was identified as the causative agent, belonging to the Coronaviridae family (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2). Within the same month, the virus spread to other provinces of China, as well as a number of neighbouring countries. On February 11, 2020, the WHO announced that the SARS-CoV-2 - caused infection would be called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On February 15, 2020, the first death due to COVID-19 in Europe was reported; a Chinese tourist who died in France. The first COVID-19 case was diagnosed in Greece on February 26th. The WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020. On March 12th, movie theaters, gyms and courtrooms were closed in Greece and on March 13th, with 190 confirmed cases and 1 death, malls, cafés, restaurants, bars, beauty parlors, museums and archaeological sites were also closed.

RESULTS Fever was found in 97.8% of the patients. Clinical symptoms were mild, but X-ray and CT findings were distinct. CT scanning demonstrated ground glass like lesions and large patchy exudation and consolidation at the early stage in 6 cases. Different findings on radiography and CT were related to the different phases of the disease. After treatment, most lesions were absorbed completely, but slowly in patients with multi-lobe consolidation and/or extensive interstitial infiltration. CONCLUSION Special clinical and imaging findings could be found in SARS cases.

The frequent alterations in the antigenic structures of respiratory viruses, particularly for RNA viruses, pose difficulties in production of effective vaccines. The unavailability of optimal medication and shortage of effective vaccines suggests the requirement for alternative natural therapies. Several herbal remedies were used for prevention and treatment viral respiratory illnesses. Among those that were found effective included maoto, licorice roots, antiwei, North American ginseng, berries, Echinacea, plants extracted carnosic acid, pomegranate, guava tea, and Bai Shao. There is scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of several complementary therapies for colds. Oral zinc may reduce the length and severity of a cold. Taking vitamin C supplements on a regular basis only slightly reduces the length and severity of colds. Probiotics were found better than placebo in reducing the number episodes of acute upper respiratory tract infections, the rate of episodes of acute upper respiratory tract infection and reducing antibiotic use. Alkaline diets or drinks might have antiviral properties as in vitro studies demonstrated inactivation effect of alkaline medium on respiratory virus. Earthing might have a natural anti-inflammatory effect for human body. It is now accepted that an overwhelming inflammatory response is the cause of human deaths from avian H5N1 influenza infection. Earthing accelerates immune response following vaccination, as demonstrated by increases of gamma globulin concentration. No in vivo or clinical studies were found that investigate the role of alkalization or earthing on respiratory viral infections. Thus, future studies are recommended to reveal any potential curative effects.","Mousa, Haider Abdul-Lateef",Journal of evidence-based complementary & alternative medicine,100,33

Quantification of the T-cell response upon contact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins in vitro was based on IFN-γ. Significantly higher numbers of activated cells were measured in patients who underwent COVID-19. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 T cells were detected weeks after the active virus disappeared from the organism. Repeated sample collection after five months proved that the T-cell activation was weaker in time in 79 % of the patients. In the majority of cases, the CD4+ helper T-cell subpopulation was responsible for the immune reaction. Moreover, different viral proteins triggered activation in CD4+ helper and in CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Together, these findings suggest that the T-cell activation level identifies the individuals who underwent COVID-19 and may become a diagnostic tool for the disease.","Simara, P; Tesarova, L; Tapuchova, I; Celerova, J; Koutna, I",Folia biologica,100,11

The immigration detention system is legally classified as civil, rather than criminal, and therefore non-punitive. Yet it mimics the criminal incarceration system and holds detained individuals in punitive, prison-like conditions. Within immigration detention centers, there are increasing reports and recognition of civil and human rights abuses, including preventable in-custody deaths. In this paper, we propose understanding the health impacts of detention as an accumulation of mental and physical trauma that take place during the entirety of a detained immigrant's experience, from migration to potential deportation and removal. Further, we explore the social-structural determinants of health as they relate to immigration detention, contextualize these determinants within a human rights framework, and draw parallels to the larger context of US mass incarceration. Realizing the right to health requires addressing these social-structural determinants of health. For the care of immigrant patients to be effective, clinicians and public health professionals must incorporate an awareness of the health risks of the immigration detention system into trauma- and human rights-informed models of care during and after detention.","Saadi, Altaf; De Trinidad Young, Maria-Elena; Patler, Caitlin; Estrada, Jeremias Leonel; Venters, Homer",Health and human rights,100,33

METHODS This retrospective observational study was conducted between March and December of 2010. The data were collected from the Brazilian Ministry of Health National Case Registry Database. We included only patients (inpatients and outpatients) in whom H1N1 infection was confirmed (via laboratory testing) during the study period. The variables regarding demographic and clinical characteristics were statistically evaluated in order to compare the hospitalization rates in the presence or absence of these factors. Risk factors were identified by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS We included 4,740 patients with laboratory confirmation of H1N1 infection. Of these, 1,911 individuals were hospitalized, and 258 (13.5%) died. The risk factors for hospitalization were age (20-29 years), African or Indigenous ethnicity, presence of specific comorbidities (heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, hemoglobinopathy, immunosuppression, diabetes, obesity, puerperium, and smoking), a high number of comorbidities, and specific symptoms (dyspnea, diarrhea, vomiting, chest pain, hemoptysis, pneumonia, and wheezing). Higher levels of education and early use of oseltamivir were found to be protective factors. Hospitalization contributed to an increase in survival.

The objective of this study was to develop a time-dependent dynamic simulation model to forecast the COVID-19 autumn-winter outbreak in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, and to assess the effect of social distancing on epidemic spread. The model used was the ""Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered"" framework which incorporated appropriate compartments relevant to interventions such as quarantine, isolation and treatment. In a low-intervention scenario including only 2-week isolation for international travelers and their contacts, the model estimated a maximum peak of nearly 90 000 symptomatic cases for early May. For an intervention scenario with mandatory quarantine during a 5-month period, the curve of cases flattened and receded as the proportion of quarantined individuals increased. The maximum peak was expected to appear between May 8 and Jul 8 depending on the quarantine strategy, and the average number of infectious symptomatic cases were 46 840, 30 494, 23 164, 16 179, and 13 196 when 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% of the population remained in a 5-month-term continuous quarantine, respectively.

METHODS Between August 2007 and April 2008 we performed 10 liver resections in 9 patients using the hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery technique. RESULTS The main indication for surgery was metastatic colorectal carcinoma in seven patients and hepatocellular carcinoma in two. The mean age was 67 +/- 11 years. The tumor was solitary in seven patients. Five patients had neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Altogether, 12 lesions with an average size of 17 +/- 9 mm were resected. The mean operative time was 180 +/- 52 minutes. Average postoperative stay was 6.5 +/- 3.5 days. There was no perioperative mortality. There was one conversion to open surgery due to bleeding from the left hepatic vein. No major perioperative complications were encountered. All resected margins were free of malignancy. CONCLUSIONS Liver resection using HALS is safe and feasible and should be considered in selected patients.","Salit, Yariv; Bitterman, Arie; Lefel, Oleg; Eisenberg, Dorit; Eden, Arieh; Barzelai, Menache; Steiner, Mariana; Zuckerman, Eli; Haddad, Riad",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,100,5

Progressive deterioration of pulmonary function continues despite the aggressive use of antimicrobials. The absence of fever, neutrophilia, and systemic symptoms suggest that during pulmonary exacerbations other non-bacterial factors may have played a part. Some have suggested respiratory viruses as main suspects. So far, few data have illustrated the relationship of respiratory viruses and cystic fibrosis.

While prophylactic vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are making great progress, there is still a need to explore safe and effective therapies with biological products for COVID-19. Currently clinical trial efforts are planned and ongoing using different biological agents for anti-inflammatory therapies, immunomodulation, and therapeutic repair in COVID-19. Targeting inflammatory cytokines with antibodies or inhibitors may be an urgent therapeutic strategy for COVID-19. Importantly, it is critical for an in-depth understanding of these new clinical therapeutic agents in their conditions that are probably involved in both physiological and pathological host responses. In this article, we analyze the potential implications for the current clinical trials of therapeutic biologics and address issues for the development of the COVID-19-related biological therapies.","Li, Chenghai; Zhao, Hua; Cheng, Linna; Wang, Bin",Drug Des Devel Ther,100,4

However, participatory, evidence-informed decision-making processes to identify and weigh these factors are often not possible- especially, in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While evidence-to-decision frameworks are not able or intended to replace stakeholder participation, they can serve as a tool to approach relevancy and comprehensiveness of the criteria considered. OBJECTIVE: To develop a decision-making framework adapted to the challenges of decision-making on non-pharmacological interventions to contain the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: We employed the 'best fit' framework synthesis technique and used the WHO-INTEGRATE framework as a starting point. First, we adapted the framework through brainstorming exercises and application to case studies. Next, we conducted a content analysis of comprehensive strategy documents intended to guide policymakers on the phasing out of applied lockdown measures in Germany. Based on factors and criteria identified in this process, we developed the WICID (WHO-INTEGRATE COVID-19) framework version 1.0. RESULTS: Twelve comprehensive strategy documents were analysed. The revised framework consists of 11+1 criteria, supported by 48 aspects, and embraces a complex systems perspective. The criteria cover implications for the health of individuals and populations due to and beyond COVID-19, infringement on liberties and fundamental human rights, acceptability and equity considerations, societal, environmental and economic implications, as well as implementation, resource and feasibility considerations. DISCUSSION: The proposed framework will be expanded through a comprehensive document analysis focusing on key stakeholder groups across the society. The WICID framework can be a tool to support comprehensive evidence-informed decision-making processes.","Stratil, Jan M; Voss, Maike; Arnold, Laura",,100,16

One of the main directions to fight the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia, as well as almost all over the world, is the introduction of a self-isolation regime. Such decision has led to the fact that in 2020 in the Russian economy in almost all sectors, the reduction in indicators was recorded. The construction industry has become an exception have kept economic performance at the same level. This was made possible through the growth of mortgage lending carried out by commercial banks. The article analyzes the current volume of mortgage loans in Russia. The authors have identified a number of scenarios for the development of the Russian mortgage market developed by experts in the field of economics, and at the moment they have also underlined the main problem in the area. The essence and conditions of mortgage loans as well as the terms of their validity in the context of epidemic were studied. The article has considered the preferential mortgage program approved by the Russian government, which had become the main source of a mortgage bubble. The main conditions and requirements of the program were analyzed. The main reasons having led to emergence of the mortgage bubble in the Russian financial market were identified and analyzed.

In order to minimise the number of hospital visits for patients receiving durvalumab during the COVID-19 pandemic we implemented 4-weekly (20 mg/kg) durvalumab in place of 2-weekly infusions at The Royal Marsden Hospital. We assessed the potential impact of the safety of a 4-weekly schedule in patients receiving adjuvant durvalumab. We carried out a retrospective study of 40 patients treated with 2-weekly and 4-weekly infusions of durvalumab prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical documentation was analysed from 216 consultations across 40 patients receiving 2-weekly durvalumab and 66 consultations of 14 patients who switched from 2-weekly to 4-weekly durvalumab during the COVID-19 pandemic. In patients receiving 2-weekly durvalumab, the rate of grade 3 and 4 toxicities was 15 % compared to 7% in patients receiving 4-weekly durvalumab. Pre-existing autoimmune disease was considered a risk factor for the development of grade 3 or 4 toxicities. We did not observe any difference in the rate of grade 1 and 2 toxicities between the two groups. Our findings support the use of 4-weekly durvalumab during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, obviating the need for 2-weekly face-to-face consultations and blood tests, relevant given the current pandemic and the need to re-structure cancer services to minimise patient hospital visits and exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","Joshi, Kroopa; Muhith, Abdul; Obeid, Mariam; Milner-Watts, Charlotte; Yousaf, Nadia; Popat, Sanjay; Davidson, Michael; Bhosle, Jaishree; O039,; Brien, Mary; Minchom, Anna",Lung Cancer,100,24

Descriptive and inferential analyses of case characteristics between 2019 and 2020 periods were conducted, and a multivariable logistic regression model developed. Results: Despite a decrease in overall ED cases during the lockdown, the number of suicide-related presentations stayed the same and represented a significantly larger proportion of cases in comparison to the pre-COVID period (0.42 vs. 0.87%, in 2019 and 2020, respectively; p < .001).

Collaboration between researchers, public health workers, and politicians has been established to deal with the epidemic. One important contribution from researchers in epidemiology is the analysis of trends so that both the current state and short-term future trends can be carefully evaluated. Gompertz model has been shown to correctly describe the dynamics of cumulative confirmed cases, since it is characterized by a decrease in growth rate showing the effect of control measures. Thus, it provides a way to systematically quantify the Covid-19 spreading velocity and it allows short-term predictions and longer-term estimations. This model has been employed to fit the cumulative cases of Covid-19 from several European countries. Results show that there are systematic differences in spreading velocity among countries. The model predictions provide a reliable picture of the short-term evolution in countries that are in the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak, and may permit researchers to uncover some characteristics of the long-term evolution.

Materials and Methods: Other viral pathogens were identified. COVID-19 immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G were detected. Results: Of the 56 samples collected from women, 2 (3.5%) were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), whereas 8 (10%) of the 80 samples from men were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The number of respiratory syncytial virus-A--positive cases was 6 (10.7%) in women and 14 (17.5%) in men. Two (3.5%) of the women were positive for parainfluenza-3, and 6 of the men were positive for influenza-B. The number of human metapneumovirus (HMPV)--positive women and men was 6 (10.7%) and 6 (7.5%), respectively. Rhinovirus caused 14.2% and 10% of the cases in men and women, respectively.

SARS-CoV-2 had a mean incidence rate of 7% in men and women. The antibody screening results reveal that antibody formation did not occur in 3 women among the 10 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19, and antibody formation occurred in 2 of 7 men. Antibody formation occurred in 5 women (16.6%) and 7 men (20.5%) among the 58 patients who were positive for other respiratory tract pathogens. However, 23 (29.5%) of the blood samples collected from 78 individuals who were negative for the COVID-19 agent and other respiratory tract viral pathogens were positive for the COVID-19 antibody. Conclusion: Because the climate is colder than normal in areas settled at higher altitudes, more than one pathogens act together. In addition, respiratory infections are seen in all seasons. This causes the diseases to be fewer and milder than in other regions.

New understanding has emerged about the innate and adaptive immune responses elicited in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The understanding of innate immune responses generated in hosts early in SARS-CoV-2 infection is vital for treatment efforts. Antiviral cytokines are released by innate immune cells in response to viral infections that play a pivotal role in limiting viral replication, pathology and generating optimal adaptive immune responses alongside the long-term memory responses against reinfections. One aspect of innate immune response generated against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo and which has received much attention has been high proinflammatory cytokine release in COVID-19 patients. Another vital discovery has been that the antiviral cytokine type I Interferon (IFN) family IFN-&#945; mediates upregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) membrane protein in airway epithelial cells. ACE2 is a receptor that SARS-CoV-2 binds to infect host cells. New understanding has emerged about the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 induced exaggerated proinflammatory cytokine release as well as transcriptional regulation of ACE2. This review discusses various mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 induced exaggerated proinflammatory cytokine response as well as transcriptional regulation of ACE2 receptor.

There's currently no specific drug available for treatment of coronaviruses or PEDV. METHOD: In the current study, we use coronavirus PEDV as a model to study antiviral agents. Briefly, a fusion inhibitor tHR2, recombinant lentivirus-delivered shRNAs targeted to conserved M and N sequences, homoharringtonine (HHT), and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were surveyed for their antiviral effects. RESULTS: Treatment with HCQ at 50 µM and HHT at 150 nM reduced virus titer in TCID50 by 30 and 3.5 fold respectively, and the combination reduced virus titer in TCID50 by 200 fold. CONCLUSION: Our report demonstrates that the combination of HHT and HCQ exhibited higher antiviral activity than either HHT or HCQ exhibited.

Understanding and Modeling Brain Activity in Source Credibility Evaluation,13.238507,6.0073743,2020,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to explore patient and carer experiences of psychosocial assessments following presentations to hospital after self-harm. DESIGN: Thematic analysis of free-text responses to an open-ended online survey. SETTING: Between March and November 2019, we recruited 88 patients (82% women) and 14 carers aged &#8805;18 years from 16 English mental health trusts, community organisations, and via social media. RESULTS: Psychosocial assessments were experienced as helpful on some occasions but harmful on others. Participants felt better, less suicidal and less likely to repeat self-harm after good-quality compassionate and supportive assessments. However, negative experiences during the assessment pathway were common and, in some cases, contributed to greater distress, less engagement and further self-harm. Participants reported receiving negative and stigmatising comments about their injuries. Others reported that they were refused medical care or an anaesthetic. Stigmatising attitudes among some mental health staff centred on preconceived ideas over self-harm as a 'behavioural issue', inappropriate use of services and psychiatric diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight important patient experiences that can inform service provision and they demonstrate the value of involving patients/carers throughout the research process. Psychosocial assessments can be beneficial when empathetic and collaborative but less helpful when overly standardised, lacking in compassion and waiting times are unduly long. Patient views are essential to inform practice, particularly given the rapidly changing service context during and after the COVID-19 emergency.","Quinlivan, Leah M; Gorman, Louise; Littlewood, Donna L; Monaghan, Elizabeth; Barlow, Steven J; Campbell, Stephen M; Webb, Roger T; Kapur, Navneet",BMJ Open,100,24
227239,227239,227239,Fighting Words in the Antipodes,13.253158,6.112698,2020,"This paper presents a reflexive analysis of how university educators experience the shift to increasing online teaching in 2019. We explore what it means to be an online educator in contemporary higher education and aim to raise questions about how we approach online education and understand ourselves as educators, informed by a sociomaterial lens. The research utilised collaborative autoethnography (CAE) to facilitate meaning‐making and uncover complex perspectives through collaboration and conversation. This enabled us to question what we as educators were losing and what we were gaining as a consequence of shifting to more online modes of teaching via university mandated platforms and processes. Through this methodology, various themes emerged: the role of corporeality;how we constructed ourselves through texts;how others materialised us in virtual spaces;the experience of online time;and our transforming practices and identities. This paper provides a snapshot of a significant cultural milieu in academia as we were afforded time to engage in reflexive practice about teaching online just as the academic world was abruptly mandated to shift almost wholly online. It also provides unique insights into the significance of understanding ourselves as both embodied and social, and the importance of community within academia. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Higher education's shift online, both before and during COVID, has had a substantial effect on university staff, including discomfort and loss of agency. What this paper adds Considering the material and embodied is important in online education, particularly because it can be taken‐for‐granted and hence overlooked. Feelings of disconnection can result from the inevitable gap between how educators represent themselves online and how others perceive (“materialise”) them online. Experiencing a lack of connection with online students provides the opportunity to question assumptions about student experiences and develop more nuanced online teaching practice. Teaching requires some kind of reconciliation between the linear time as laid out in learning design and the not‐yet‐here/always‐there time of online learning. Implications for practice and/or policy Attention must continue to be paid to the experiences of educators as even experienced ones find teaching online disturbs identities and practices. Collegially sharing virtual spaces may assist university educators in making sense of the shifts demanded by online teaching and allow more active modelling of meaning‐making processes for students. Teaching may benefit from deliberate consideration of developing online personas and reflection on how to accommodate them within academic professional identities.

The effect of lockdown measures on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is currently uncertain. In this article, we analyse the effects of the lockdown measures on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in one of the epicentres in SA. OBJECTIVES: To measure the effects of lockdown measures introduced in SA on SARS-CoV-2 attack rates (ARs, the percentage of individuals who tested positive in a specified time period) in Gauteng Province during a 4-month period (March - June 2020). METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used a comprehensive database from an independent pathology laboratory in Gauteng. We analysed trends of positivity rates of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests done during the 4-month period. The ARs are reported over time (unweighted and age-weighted 14-day moving averages) by age groups, gender, and different regions/districts in Gauteng. RESULTS: A total of 162 528 tests were performed at a private laboratory between 5 March and 30 June 2020, of which 20 574 were positive (overall AR 12.7%). These positive tests constituted 44.8% of all positive cases in the province (20 574/45 944). Sixty-two percent of all tests were done in June during lockdown level 3. There was an exponential increase in the AR in June (18.3%) when lockdown was eased to level 3, in comparison with 4.2% (March), 2.2% (April) and 3.3% (May). The increase in June was seen in all the age groups, although it was more pronounced in the 21 - 60 years age groups than the younger (0 - 20 years) and older (&gt;60 years) age groups. The AR was significantly higher in males (13.2%) compared with females (12.1%) (&#967;2 test, p&lt;0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study testify to the rapid increase in ARs resulting from easing of the lockdown regulations, especially to level 3 in June. Of concern is the upward trend in the AR across all age groups, especially &lt;20 years (15.9%), which was not reported in other parts of the world. Population age dynamics should therefore be considered when taking future decisions about lockdown regulations.","Pillai, J; Motloba, P; Motaung, K S C; Ozougwu, L U; Ikalafeng, B K; Marinda, E; Lukhele, M; Basu, D",S Afr Med J,100,1

Almost all surgical services have been reorganized, with the aim of maintaining an adequate therapeutic path, especially for surgical emergencies. The knowledge of how surgeons dealing with emergency surgery have reacted to the epidemic in the real life can be useful while drafting clinical recommendations. METHODS: Surgeons from multiple Italian regions were invited answering to an online survey in order to make a snapshot of their current behaviors towards COVID-19-positive patients bearing urgent surgical diseases. Questions about institutional rules and personal approach for patient treatment and to limit epidemic spread were included in a 37-item questionnaire. RESULTS: Seventy-one questionnaires from institutions dealing with emergency surgery were accepted. Participating surgeons were equally subdivided from a geographical point of view, with a large proportion of public (97.2%) and non-academical (91.5%) centers. In 80.3% of cases, the hospitals treated COVID-19 patients; in 69.1% of centers, a change in work plan was necessary, and 33.8% of teams had almost a surgeon infected or in preventive quarantine. The vast majority of surgeons operated only on urgent cases (73.9%), but the number of interventions significantly dropped. Up to 40% of non-traumatic abdominal emergency cases had an unusual delayed treatment. The laparoscopic approach was used in 69.6% of interventions on COVID-19 patients. Strategies to protect health care workers against COVID-19 infection and to identify asymptomatic infected surgeons were suboptimal with respect to the WHO recommendations in 70.4% and 90.2% of centers, respectively. Advanced personal protective equipment for operating room workers was adopted for all surgeries in only 12.7% of centers. DISCUSSION: This survey confirms that the COVID-19 outbreak is dramatically changing the practice of emergency surgery centers in Italy. Despite the reduction in number, urgent cases were on average more challenging owing to diagnostic delay. Recommendations from the International Scientific Societies are frequently not complied concerning the use of laparoscopic approach, the availability of personal protective equipment in the operating rooms, and the testing of both asymptomatic physicians and patients scheduled for surgery. A further evaluation of the short-term results of these attitudes is warranted to modulate international recommendations.","Patriti, Alberto; Baiocchi, Gian Luca; Catena, Fausto; Marini, Pierluigi; Catarci, Marco",World J Emerg Surg,100,17

The present study aimed to assess the diagnostic usability of rapid tests for the detection of antibody against SARS-CoV-2 through comparison of their results with the results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA and with the results of a quantitative test for antibody detection. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 18 patients undergoing RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Twelve patients were RT-PCR positive while six were negative. A quantitative test based on chemiluminescent immunoassay and three rapid tests based on immunochromatography were performed to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. RESULTS: All the antibody tests exhibited poor sensitivity at the timing of initial RT-PCR diagnosis. IgG responses occurring prior to or simultaneously with IgM responses were observed through not only the quantitative test but also the three rapid tests. Based on concordance with the quantitative test results, the large variance among the three rapid tests was revealed. CONCLUSIONS: All antibody tests were unsatisfactory to replace RT-PCR for the early diagnosis of COVID-19. Rapid antibody tests as well as a quantitative antibody test were useful in the assessment of immune responses in COVID-19. The obvious variance among the three rapid tests suggested limited accuracy and difficult standardization. Diagnostic usability of rapid antibody tests for COVID-19 should be investigated rigorously.","Uwamino, Yoshifumi; Wakui, Masatoshi; Aoki, Wataru; Kurafuji, Toshinobu; Yanagita, Emmy; Morita, Maasa; Nagata, Mika; Inose, Rika; Noguchi, Masayo; Yokota, Hiromitsu; Hasegawa, Naoki; Saya, Hideyuki; Murata, Mitsuru",Ann Clin Biochem,100,20

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort of 127 patients was divided into three groups based on the histology results and NBI vascular pattern of the mucosa. Group A (24/127, 18.90%) consisted of patients with suspicious vascular pattern in NBI or/and with positive deep margin. Group B (52/127, 40.94%) consisted of patients with positive or uncertain superficial margins and non-suspicious vascular pattern in NBI. Group C (51/127, 40.15%) had non-suspicious vascular NBI pattern and all negative margins. RESULTS: After the first TOLM procedure, 9/24 (37.5%) patients had positive deep margins, 1/24 (4.2%) had uncertain deep margin and 1/24 patient (4.2%) had both positive deep margin and suspicious vascular pattern in NBI. The remaining 13 cases in Group A had a suspicious NBI finding only during the first follow-up. All of the 24 patients (Group A) underwent a second look surgery. The final histology after SL showed squamous cell carcinoma in 10/24 (41.7%) patients. All 10 patients had suspicious vascular pattern in NBI and one patient had both a positive deep margins after the first TOLM and positive NBI finding. None of Group B and C subjects developed an early recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence that NBI imaging will be a useful adjunct to margin status after TOLM and will facilitate clinical decision-making regarding performing the SL in patients with positive or uncertain superficial surgical margins in the first TOLM procedure. However, additional investigation with more subjects is required at this time to further validate this technique and change the standard of care.","Witkiewicz, Joanna; Klimza, Hanna; Piersiala, Krzysztof; Jackowska, Joanna; Wierzbicka, Malgorzata",PLoS One,100,26

METHODS: We report on a family of three adults who experienced photophobia, intense eye pain, epiphora, blurred vision, and burning sensation over the face and neck area after a short period of unprotected exposure to UV germicidal lamps. RESULTS: Initial examination revealed erythema and tenderness over the face and neck area, reduced visual acuity of 6/12, and conjunctival injections bilaterally in all three patients. Further assessment at the ophthalmology department three days later revealed gradual improvement of visual acuity to 6/6 bilaterally. Slit-lamp examinations revealed few punctate epithelial erosions. Fundal examinations were normal without evidence of solar retinopathy. The patients were diagnosed with germicidal-range UV irradiation-induced photokeratitis and epidermal phototoxicity. Lubricants and emollients were prescribed for symptom relief, and the patients were warned against using a UV germicidal lamp for disinfection purposes without appropriate protection. CONCLUSIONS: Although SARS-CoV-2 is structurally akin to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, and previous studies demonstrated high levels of inactivation of beta-coronavirus with germicidal-range UV, evidence for its efficacy to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 is lacking. This case report serves to emphasize the potential consequences of phototoxicity from improper use of UV germicidal lamps for household disinfection as well as to highlight the fact that UV germicidal lamps currently have no established role in household disinfection of SARS-CoV-2.","Leung, Kai Ching Peter; Ko, Tak Chuen Simon",Cornea,100,20

However, little is known about the prevalence of WENV infections in humans in China. To determine the threat that WENV may pose to humans, we determine the seroprevalence of WENV in healthy individuals in China in this study. Cross-reactivities of nucleoprotein (NP) were detected between Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and WENV using Western blot and ELISA assy. The prevalence of specific IgG antibodies against WENV NP was investigated in different age groups of 830 healthy individuals aged 0-70 years old in China using a competition ELISA assay. The results indicate that WENV and LCMV share cross-reactive epitopes between NPs. The total seroprevalence of WENV in healthy adults was 4.6%, with 3.6% (8/221) for individuals 15-44 years of age, 5.4% (17/317) for individuals 45-59 years of age, and 4.1% (4/98) for older adults over 60. The total seroprevalence of WENV in children under age 15 was 1.5%, with 2.9% (1/34) in children aged 2-5 years, and 2.2% in 5-14 years (2/91). The finding suggests that WENV or WENV-like virus may sporadically infect humans of China.","Guo, Li; Liu, Shasha; Song, Jingdong; Han, Lianlian; Zhang, Hu; Wu, Chao; Wang, Conghui; Zhou, Hongli; Wang, Jianwei",,100,1

In this study, a codon-optimized Mpro gene was cloned into pET-21a and pET-28a expression vectors. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli Rosetta(DE3) competent cells and the expression conditions were optimized. The highly expressed recombinant proteins, Mpro and Mpro-28, were purified by HisTrapTM chelating column and its proteolytic activity was determined by a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. The FRET assay showed that Mpro exhibits a desirable proteolytic activity (25 000 U/mg), with Km and kcat values of 11.68 µmol/L and 0.037/s, respectively. The specific activity of Mpro is 25 times that of Mpro-28, a fusion protein carrying a polyhistidine tag at the N and C termini, indicating additional residues at the N terminus of Mpro, but not at the C terminus, are detrimental to its proteolytic activity. The preparation of active SARS-CoV-2 Mpro through codon-optimization strategy might facilitate the development of the rapid screening assays for the discovery of broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral drugs targeting Mpro.","Chen, Yunyu; Fu, Zhenghao; Yan, Gangan; Lin, Yuan; Liu, Xiaoping",Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao,100,23

DESIGN: Pooled cross-sectional survey data. SETTING: Health Information National Trends Survey. PARTICIPATION: Data included 6 iterations of U.S. adults (Pooled: N = 19,496; 2007: N = 3,593; 2011: N = 3,959; 2013: N = 3,185; FDA 2015: N = 3,738; 2017: N = 3,285; and FDA 2017: N = 1,736). MEASURES: Outcome variables were health information seeking, high confidence, and high trust of health information from several sources. Independent variables were education and income group, controlling for other sociodemographic variables. ANALYSIS: Weighted descriptive and multivariate logistic regression for the pooled sample assessed associations by education and income. Fully interacted models with education/income-survey year interactions compared differences in outcomes between years. RESULTS: We found information seeking, confidence, and trust were associated with income and education, which supported previously reported findings. Additionally, our findings indicated low-and medium-income groups had significantly lower odds of seeking health information compared to those in a high-income group. Regarding trust of information, a high school education was associated with higher odds of trust in family and friends. We also found that, over time, information seeking, confidence, and trust behavior differed by income and education, with some differences persisting. CONCLUSION: Disparities by income and education in trust of information sources remained across time. Understanding optimal information sources, their reach, and their credibility among groups could enable more targeted interventions and health messaging.

In this meta-analysis we investigate this association and determine SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals' odds of having a specific blood group compared to controls. We performed a systematic search on MEDLINE and LitCovid databases for studies published through July 15, 2020. Seven studies met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis, including a total of 13 subgroups of populations (7503 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and 2962160 controls). We analysed the odds of having each blood group among SARS-CoV-2 positive patients compared with controls. Random-effects models were used to obtain the overall pooled odds ratio (OR). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed in order to explore the source of heterogeneity and results consistency. The results of our meta-analysis indicate that SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals are more likely to have blood group A (pooled OR 1.23, 95%CI: 1.09-1.40) and less likely to have blood group O (pooled OR = 0.77, 95%CI: 0.67-0.88).

This carries cost and capacity implications for hospitals with additional strain on endoscopy units during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The Kangaroo Feeding Tube with IRIS Technology (IRIS) uses optical visualization to guide bedside placement, obviating the need for endoscopy. We describe a case series of bedside postpyloric enteral feeding tube placement using the IRIS tube. METHODS: This was a prospective, single-center case series over 12 mo. Conscious and sedated adult participants were included. Exclusion criteria were altered anatomy and need for endoscopy for other indications. IRIS placement was confirmed by contrast radiograph. RESULTS: Twenty attempts were made in 19 participants (13 women). The primary indication was intolerance of gastric feeding. The overall success rate was 75%. In sedated participants, 5 (83%) of 6 tubes were successful in 5 participants. In conscious participants, 10 (71%) of 14 tubes were successful in 14 participants. Placement failure in conscious participants was due to intolerance of the camera tip during nasal passage. The median procedure time was 13.5 min. In all cases, correct position as deemed by the operator was confirmed with contrast radiograph. No complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest single series of bedside postpyloric enteral feeding tube placement using the IRIS tube to date. The success rate and safety profile reported here, together with the potential benefits (reduced feeding delays, costs, and need for endoscopy) suggest that further, large-scale studies are warranted.","Cardona, Eva; Mehta, Shameer",Nutrition,100,1

We evaluated differences in demographic data between surviving and non-surviving COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: In a multivariate logistic analysis, age and the presence of chronic lung disease and Alzheimer's dementia (AD) were the only significant parameters for predicting COVID-19 non-survival (p < 0.05). However, hypertension, coronary vascular disease, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and history of taking angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, as well as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), were not significantly associated with the death of COVID-19 patients. The optimal cutoff value obtained from the maximum Youden index was 70 (sensitivity, 80.77%; specificity, 61.04%), and the odds ratio of non-survival increased 1.055 fold for every year of age. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should closely monitor and manage the symptoms of COVID-19 patients who are over the age of 70 years or have chronic lung disease or AD.","Hwang, Jong-Moon; Kim, Ju-Hyun; Park, Jin-Sung; Chang, Min Cheol; Park, Donghwi",Neurol Sci,100,12

In the medical field, its impact on surgical branches as well as clinical branches is inevitable. From the plastic surgery perspective, the COVID-19 outbreak affects the number and distribution of surgeries, patient admissions and educational activities. Although these impacts are predictable, it is beneficial to document these data that would contribute to the proper response to a similar crisis in the future. From this standpoint, the present study aims to analyze the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on plastic surgery practice in some aspects. Epidemiologic data of the two-time frames, routine period, and pandemic period of plastic surgery were reviewed retrospectively. The ratios of the listed data were compared between the two periods; admissions to the outpatient clinic, surgeries, consultations, anesthesia type, hospitalizations, and demographic data. While the number of outpatient clinic patients was 3511 in the routine period, it was 490 in the pandemic period. Compared to the routine period, the number of surgical interventions was decreased from 793 to 129 during the pandemic period. In particular, a statistically significant increase was observed in the rate of hand trauma and maxillofacial trauma cases during the pandemic period compared with the routine period (p < 0.001, and pâ¯=â¯0.032, respectively). Therefore, high rates of hand trauma and maxillofacial trauma should be taken into consideration when making arrangements such as personnel distribution, use of medical resources, and regulation of hospital infrastructure in extraordinary situations like COVID-19 pandemics.","Kara, Murat; Akduman, Burkay; Isik, Yahya Melih; Gürsoy, Koray; Koçer, Ugur",J. plast. reconstr. aesthet. surg,100,21

H014 administration reduced SARS-CoV-2 titers in infected lungs and prevented pulmonary pathology in a human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 mouse model. Cryo-electron microscopy characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer in complex with the H014 Fab fragment unveiled a previously uncharacterized conformational epitope, which was only accessible when the RBD was in an open conformation. Biochemical, cellular, virological, and structural studies demonstrated that H014 prevents attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to its host cell receptors.

Chemical castration is an option for surgical castration and the sclerosing agents can be administered into the testicular or epididymis parenchyma. These agents have a lower incidence of complications than surgery, especially when associated with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), which has anti-inflammatory action and increases the absorption of other drugs. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of a single intratesticular injection of calcium chloride solution associated with DMSO for the chemical sterilization of bulls. Twenty-four young adult bulls were utilized, distributed into 3 groups (G20, G30 and G40, n = 8/group), according to the calcium chloride concentration (20, 30 and 40%), in 10mL volume. Serum concentrations of testosterone, body weight, testicular volume and ecotexture, clinical signs and behavior and were evaluated for 45 days. Thus, the animals were orchiectomized and testicles were assessed histologically. There were no changes in body weight, decreased serum testosterone concentrations (except G30), signs of scrotal sensitivity or changes in behavior over the period. However, there was significant increase in testicular volume, especially on the 2nd and 3rd day after treatment, with values returning to the value initials at 15 days. Testicular adherence and firm consistency were observed during orchiectomy. Ultrasound examination revealed a loss of integrity of the median raphe, with cavity formation and an alteration of the testicular echotexture. In the histological evaluation, coagulation necrosis of seminiferous tubules and interstitial cells was observed, mainly in the medial portion in all groups. Some animals presented total absence of tubular formations in all the studied groups, being the effects of greater intensity in the G40. Additionally, pronounced edema was noted in all groups, especially in G40. Inflammatory infiltrate, fibroplasia and neovascularization were found to be predominantly discrete. Based on the conditions used in this study, we conclude that calcium chloride associated with DMSO can be used as a method of chemical sterilization in bovines.(AU)","Pereira, Lucas F; Dias, Fernanda G.

However, this second wave manifests itself strongly in new reported cases, but less in death counts compared to the first wave. Over the past three months in Germany, the reported cases increased by a factor five or more, whereas the death counts hardly grew. This discrepancy fueled speculations that the rise of reported cases would not reflect a second wave but only wider testing. We find that this apparent discrepancy can be explained to a large extent by the age structure of the infected, and predict a pronounced increase of death counts in the near future, as the spread once again expands into older age groups. To re-establish control, and to avoid the tipping point when TTI capacity is exceeded, case numbers have to be lowered. Otherwise the control of the spread and the protection of vulnerable people will require more restrictive measures latest when the hospital capacity is reached.","Linden, Matthias; Dehning, Jonas; Mohr, Sebastian B.; Mohring, Jan; Meyer-Hermann, Michael; Pigeot, Iris; Schobel, Anita; Priesemann, Viola",,100,3

Key themes included the opportunity to develop new online resources and the chance to engage in new academic collaborations. Academics frequently mentioned the challenge that time constrains could place on the quality and effectiveness of these resources; especially as in many cases the aim of these resources was to compensate for a lack of exposure to cadaveric exposure. Comparisons of the actions taken by multiple higher education institutions reveal the ways that academics have tried to balance this demand.

The gut microbiota influences immune function, is malleable, and may provide a target for interventions aiming to reduce RTI burden. This narrative review summarizes existing evidence regarding the effectiveness of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics, all of which are gut microbiota-targeted interventions, for reducing the burden of RTI in military-relevant populations (i.e., healthy non-elderly adults). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search strategy was used to identify recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials conducted in healthy non-elderly adults which examined effects of probiotics, prebiotics, or synbiotics on the incidence, duration, and/or severity of RTI, or on immune responses to vaccinations against viruses that cause RTI. Relevant randomized controlled clinical trials not included in those reports were also identified. RESULTS: Meta-analyses and multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that certain probiotic strains may reduce the incidence, duration, and/or severity of RTI and improve immune responses to vaccination against RTI-causing pathogens in various populations including healthy non-elderly adults. Fewer randomized controlled trials have examined the effects of prebiotics or synbiotics on RTI-related outcomes in healthy non-elderly adults. Nevertheless, some studies conducted within that population and other populations have observed that certain prebiotics and synbiotics reduce the incidence, duration, and/or severity of RTI or improve immune responses to vaccinations against RTI-causing viruses. However, across all product classes, not all product formulations have shown benefit, and most have not been tested in multiple randomized controlled trials in military-relevant populations. CONCLUSION: Dietary supplementation with certain gut microbiota-targeted interventions, and certain probiotics in particular, may provide viable strategies for reducing RTI-related illness in military personnel.

The current study aims to assess the performance of the healthcare systems of the countries above fifty million citizens in facing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic since late December 2019. For this purpose, seven scenarios were adopted via the DEA methodology with six variables, which are the number of medical practitioners (doctors and nurses), hospital beds, Conducted Covid-19 tests, affected cases, recovered cases, and death cases. To shed light on the relative efficiency of drivers, the Tobit analysis was used. Besides, the study carried out various statistical tests for the DEA models' findings to validate the choice of the variables and the obtained scores. The DEA results reveal that less than half of the considered countries are relatively efficient. Moreover, the Tobit regression analysis showed that the main impact on the efficiency scores was due to the number of affected and recovered cases. Finally, the results of the tests of Spearman, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis H indicate the internal validity and robustness of the chosen DEA models. The current study findings raise important implications, which can be helpful for decision makers regarding continuous improvement of performance, in which the findings assert the importance of achieving the best practices regarding relative efficiency through the linkage between the healthcare systems’ resources, and the needed outputs. © 2021 by the authors;licensee Growing Science, Canada.","Mourad, N.; Habib, A.

Data on the impact of the underlying pathogens are still controversial. Samples from the upper (n = 322) and lower RT (n = 169) were collected from 136 children and 355 adults; 225 among them have been immunocompromised patients. Exclusion criteria were presence of relevant cultivable microorganisms, C-reactive protein > 20 mg/dl, or procalcitonin > 2.0 ng/ml. Samples were tested by PCR for the presence of herpesviruses (HSV-1/-2; VZV; CMV; HHV6; EBV), adenoviruses, bocaviruses, entero-/rhinoviruses (HRV), parechoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza viruses (IV), parainfluenza viruses as well as for pneumoviruses (HMPV and RSV), and atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, M.p.; Chlamydia pneumoniae, C.p.). Viral/bacterial genome equivalents were detected in more than two-thirds of specimens. Under immunosuppression, herpesviruses (EBV 30.9%/14.6%, p < 0.001; CMV 19.6%/7.9%, p < 0.001; HSV-1: 14.2%/7.1%, p = 0.012) were frequently observed, mainly through their reactivation in adults. Immunocompromised adults tended to present a higher RSV prevalence (6.4%/2.4%, p = 0.078). Immunocompetent patients were more frequently tested positive for IV (15.0%/5.8%, p = 0.001) and M.p. (6.4%/0.4%, p < 0.001), probably biased due to the influenza pandemic of 2009 and an M.p. epidemic in 2011. About 41.8% of samples were positive for a single pathogen, and among them EBV (19.9%) was most prevalent followed by HRV (18.2%) and IV (16.6%). HSV-2 and C.p. were not found. Marked seasonal effects were observed for HRV, IV, and RSV. Differences in pathogen prevalence were demonstrated between immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. The exact contribution of some herpesviruses to the development of RTI remains unclear.","Reckziegel, Maria; Weber-Osel, Claudia; Egerer, Renate; Gruhn, Bernd; Kubek, Florian; Walther, Mario; Wilhelm, Stefanie; Zell, Roland; Krumbholz, Andi",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,100,24

We describe herein the structure-guided optimization of a series of inhibitors of the coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro), an enzyme essential for viral replication. The optimized compounds were effective against several human coronaviruses including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 in an enzyme assay and in cell-based assays using Huh-7 and Vero E6 cell lines. Two selected compounds showed antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 in cultured primary human airway epithelial cells. In a mouse model of MERS-CoV infection, administration of a lead compound 1 day after virus infection increased survival from 0 to 100% and reduced lung viral titers and lung histopathology. These results suggest that this series of compounds has the potential to be developed further as antiviral drugs against human coronaviruses.","Rathnayake, Athri D; Zheng, Jian; Kim, Yunjeong; Perera, Krishani Dinali; Mackin, Samantha; Meyerholz, David K; Kashipathy, Maithri M; Battaile, Kevin P; Lovell, Scott; Perlman, Stanley; Groutas, William C; Chang, Kyeong-Ok",Sci. transl. med,100,16
281636,281636,281636,LOSS OF RIGHT CHOICE: Ethical Quandary in the Wake of Coronavirus,13.419285,5.8466287,2020,"BACKGROUND: The available evidence of the health effects of urban regeneration is scarce In Latin America, and there are no studies focused on formal housing that longitudinally evaluate the impact of housing and neighborhood interventions on health. The ""Regeneración Urbana, Calidad de Vida y Salud"" (Urban Regeneration, Quality of Life, and Health) or RUCAS project is a longitudinal, multi-method study that will evaluate the impact of an intervention focused on dwellings, built environment and community on the health and wellbeing of the population in two social housing neighborhoods in Chile. METHODS: RUCAS consists of a longitudinal study where inhabitants exposed and unexposed to the intervention will be compared over time within the study neighborhoods (cohorts), capitalizing on interventions as a natural experiment. Researchers have developed a specific conceptual framework and identified potential causal mechanisms. Proximal and more distal intervention effects will be measured with five instruments, implemented pre- and post-interventions between 2018 and 2021: a household survey, an observation tool to evaluate dwelling conditions, hygrochrons for measuring temperature and humidity inside dwellings, systematic observation of recreational areas, and qualitative interviews. Survey baseline data (956 households, 3130 individuals) is presented to describe sociodemographics, housing and health characteristics of both cohorts, noting that neighborhoods studied show worse conditions than the Chilean population. DISCUSSION: RUCAS' design allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the effects that the intervention could have on various dimensions of health and health determinants. RUCAS will face some challenges, like changes in the intervention process due to adjustments of the master plan, exogenous factors -including COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns- and lost to follow-up. Given the stepped wedge design, that the study capitalizes on within household changes over time, the possibility of adjusting data collection process and complementarity of methods, RUCAS has the flexibility to adapt to these circumstances. Also, RUCAS' outreach and retention strategy has led to high retention rates. RUCAS will provide evidence to inform regeneration processes, highlighting the need to consider potential health effects of regeneration in designing such interventions and, more broadly, health as a key priority in urban and housing policies.","Baeza, Fernando; Vives Vergara, Alejandra; González, Francisca; Orlando, Laura; Valdebenito, Roxana; Cortinez-O039,; Ryan, Andrea; Slesinski, Claire; Diez Roux, Ana V",BMC Public Health,100,24

Demand for online learning has surged during a period of mass layoffs and transition to remote work and schooling. Can this uptake in online learning help close longstanding skills gaps in the US workforce in a sustainable and equitable manner? We answer this question by analyzing individual engagement data of DataCamp users between October 2019 and September 2020 (n = 277,425). Exploiting the staggered adoption of actions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 across states, we identify the causal effect at the neighborhood level. The adoption of nonessential business closures led to a 38% increase in new users and a 6% increase in engagement among existing users. We find that these increases are proportional across higher- and lower-income neighborhoods and neighborhoods with a high or low share of Black residents. This demonstrates the potential for online platforms to democratize access to knowledge and skills that are in high demand, which supports job security and facilitates social mobility.","Kizilcec, Rene F; Makridis, Christos A; Sadowski, Katharine C",Proc.

We herein evaluate existing evidence for the molecular alterations within the RAS pathway (e.g., ACE2 and angiotensin II) during SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This includes reports regarding potential effect of RAS blockade (e.g., ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers) on ACE2 expression and clinical outcomes in patients with co-morbidities commonly treated with these agents. The collective evidence suggests a dual role for ACE2 in COVID-19, depending on the stage of infection and the coexisting diseases in individual patients. This information is further discussed with respect to potential therapeutic strategies targeting RAS for COVID-19 treatment.","Dean, Alexis Q; Bozza, William P; Twomey, Julianne D; Luo, Shen; Nalli, Ancy; Zhang, Baolin",Drug discov. today,100,16

Well-being outcomes, along with mitigation strategies were measured through a cross sectional survey of Australian gamers and non-gamers aged between 12 and 24 years, and parents of the 12-17-year-olds surveyed. Adverse health consequences were associated with heavy gaming, more so than light/casual gaming, suggesting that interventions that target moderated engagement could be effective. It provides timely insights in an online gaming landscape that has rapidly evolved over the past decade, and particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, to include the hyper-connected, highly commercialized and rapidly growing online gaming and esports sector.","Kelly, S.; Magor, T.; Wright, A.",Frontiers in Psychology,100,1

The review was reported per the PRISMA checklist, and the literature search was conducted in 6 databases and in gray literature. Studies published in any language mentioning oral symptoms and signs in patients with COVID-19 were included. The risk of bias was assessed by the Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tools. The certainty of evidence was evaluated through GRADE assessment. After a 2-step selection, 40 studies were included: 33 cross-sectional and 7 case reports. Overall, 10,228 patients (4,288 males, 5,770 females, and 170 unknown) from 19 countries were assessed. Gustatory impairment was the most common oral manifestation, with a prevalence of 45% (95% CI, 34% to 55%; I2 = 99%). The pooled eligible data for different taste disorders were 38% for dysgeusia and 35% for hypogeusia, while ageusia had a prevalence of 24%. Taste disorders were associated with COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 12.68; 95% CI, 6.41 to 25.10; I2 = 63%; P < 0.00001), mild/moderate severity (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.25 to 3.49; I2 = 66%; P = 0.005), and female patients (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.17; I2 = 70%; P = 0.0007). Oral mucosal lesions presented multiple clinical aspects, including white and erythematous plaques, irregular ulcers, small blisters, petechiae, and desquamative gingivitis. Tongue, palate, lips, gingiva, and buccal mucosa were affected. In mild cases, oral mucosal lesions developed before or at the same time as the initial respiratory symptoms; however, in those who required medication and hospitalization, the lesions developed approximately 7 to 24 d after onset symptoms. Therefore, taste disorders may be common symptoms in patients with COVID-19 and should be considered in the scope of the disease's onset and progression. Oral mucosal lesions are more likely to present as coinfections and secondary manifestations with multiple clinical aspects (PROSPERO CRD42020184468).","Amorim Dos Santos, J; Normando, A G C; Carvalho da Silva, R L; Acevedo, A C; De Luca Canto, G; Sugaya, N; Santos-Silva, A R; Guerra, E N S",J Dent Res,100,13

We use data from the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Virgo combined with data from their first and second observing runs. For the first time we are able to match (for PSR~J0437\textminus4715) or surpass (for PSR~J0711\textminus6830) the indirect limits on gravitational-wave emission from recycled pulsars inferred from their observed spin-downs, and constrain their equatorial ellipticities to be less than $10^{-8}$. For each of the five pulsars, we perform targeted searches that assume a tight coupling between the gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signal phase evolution. We also present constraints on PSR~J0711\textminus6830, the Crab pulsar and the Vela pulsar from a search that relaxes this assumption, allowing the gravitational-wave signal to vary from the electromagnetic expectation within a narrow band of frequencies and frequency derivatives.","Collaboration, The LIGO Scientific; Abbott, the Virgo Collaboration R.; Abbott, T.

DS patients often present with several congenital defects and chronic diseases, including immunity disorders. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;) have been seen, which appear to vary with age. At birth, patients present with combined immunodeficiency, with frequent infections that decrease with age. Furthermore, high levels of IL-4 and IL-10 with anti-inflammatory properties and low levels of IL-6 and TNF-&#945; are described in children. The immune system is believed to play an essential role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and it has been associated with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an exaggerated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that may eventually trigger a severe situation called cytokine storm. On the other hand, genetic features seem to be involved in the predisposition to illness and its severity. Overexpression of DSCR1 and ZAKI-4 inhibits the translocation of activated T lymphocyte nuclear factor (NF-AT) to the nucleus, a main step in the inflammatory responsiveness. We discuss here the possible role of immunology and genetic features of DS in the infection and prognosis in COVID-19.","Altable, Marcos; de la Serna, Juan Moisés",Neurol. sci,100,20

However, there is as yet little evidence on how the pandemic and shielding impacted the health and social well-being of CV older people. METHODS: We used data from wave 9 (2018/2019) and the first COVID-19 substudy (June/July 2020) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Using logistic and linear regression models, we investigated associations between being CV and health and social well-being during the pandemic, while controlling for prepandemic levels of the outcome variables. We also explored the interactions between CV and age group (50s, 60s, 70s, 80+), and between CV and shielding. RESULTS: CV people were more likely to report worse health and social well-being outcomes during the pandemic, even taking into account prepandemic differences. However, changes in health were not uniform across different age groups, and CV respondents were generally at greater risks of deterioration in health and social well-being compared with those not CV in the same age group. CV respondents who were shielding reported worse outcomes compared with those not CV and not shielding. CONCLUSIONS: While policies focusing on shielding CV older people reduce rates of hospitalisation and death from COVID-19, policymakers should also pay attention to understanding and addressing the wider needs of this group if their long-term health and social well-being are not to be compromised.","Di Gessa, Giorgio; Price, Debora",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),100,21

AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: Based on these observations, speculations raised the concerns that ACEIs/ARBs users would be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and would be at higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease and death. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis of the association between prior use of ACEIs and ARBs and mortality due to COVID-19 disease. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search of several databases from November 2019 to June 18, 2020 was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, and Scopus. Medrxiv.org was also searched for unpublished data. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES: Nine studies with a total of 18,833 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 met our eligibility criteria. Prior use of ACEIs and/or ARBs was associated with reduced mortality among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, with a pooled adjusted relative risk (aRR) from 6 studies of 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.42-0.94) (I = 65%). Three studies reported separately on ACEIs or ARBs and their association with survival among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, with a pooled adjusted relative risk of 0.78, 95% CI (0.58-1.04) (I = 0%) and 0.97, 95% CI (0.73-1.30) (I = 0%) respectively. The results of sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main analysis. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests that use of ACEIs/ARBs is associated with a decreased risk of death among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. This finding provides a reassurance to the public not to stop prescribed ACEIs/ARBs because of fear of severe COVID-19.","Kashour, Tarek; Bin Abdulhak, Aref A; Tlayjeh, Haytham; Hassett, Leslie C; Noman, Anas; Mohsen, Ala; Al-Mallah, Mouaz H; Tleyjeh, Imad M",Am. j. ther,100,33

Amongst the detected Covid-19 cases, several cases are also found asymptomatic. The presently available Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) system for detecting COVID-19 lacks due to limited availability of test kits and relatively low positive symptoms in the early stages of the disease, urging the need for alternative solutions. The tool based on Artificial Intelligence might help the world to develop an additional COVID-19 disease mitigation policy. In this paper, an automated Covid-19 detection system has been proposed, which uses indications from Computer Tomography (CT) images to train the new powered deep learning model- U-Net architecture. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated using 1000 Chest CT images. The images were obtained from three different sources - Two different GitHub repository sources and the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology's excellent collection. Out of 1000 images, 552 images were of normal persons, and 448 images were obtained from COVID-19 affected people. The proposed algorithm has achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 94.86% and 93.47% respectively, with an overall accuracy of 94.10%. The U-Net architecture used for Chest CT image analysis has been found effective. The proposed method can be used for primary screening of COVID-19 affected persons as an additional tool available to clinicians.","Kalane, Prasad; Patil, Sarika; Patil, B P; Sharma, Davinder Pal",Biomed Signal Process Control,100,15

OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify biomarkers for disease severity and progression of COVID-19. METHODS: Forty-eight cytokines in the plasma samples from 50 COVID-19 cases including 11 critically ill, 25 severe, and 14 moderate patients were measured and analyzed in combination with clinical data. RESULTS: Levels of 14 cytokines were found to be significantly elevated in COVID-19 cases and showed different expression profiles in patients with different disease severity. Moreover, expression levels of IFN-Î³-induced protein 10, monocyte chemotactic protein-3, hepatocyte growth factor, monokine-induced gamma IFN, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha, which were shown to be highly associated with disease severity during disease progression, were remarkably higher in critically ill patients, followed by severe and then the moderate patients. Serial detection of the 5 cytokines in 16 cases showed that continuously high levels were associated with deteriorated progression of disease and fatal outcome. Furthermore, IFN-Î³-induced protein 10 and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 were excellent predictors for the progression of COVID-19, and the combination of the 2 cytokines showed the biggest area under the curve of the receiver-operating characteristics calculations with a value of 0.99. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we report biomarkers that are highly associated with disease severity and progression of COVID-19. These findings add to our understanding of the immunopathologic mechanisms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and provide potential therapeutic targets and strategies.","Yang, Yang; Shen, Chenguang; Li, Jinxiu; Yuan, Jing; Wei, Jinli; Huang, Fengmin; Wang, Fuxiang; Li, Guobao; Li, Yanjie; Xing, Li; Peng, Ling; Yang, Minghui; Cao, Mengli; Zheng, Haixia; Wu, Weibo; Zou, Rongrong; Li, Delin; Xu, Zhixiang; Wang, Haiyan; Zhang, Mingxia; Zhang, Zheng; Gao, George F; Jiang, Chengyu; Liu, Lei; Liu, Yingxia",J. allergy clin. immunol,100,16

It is imperative to develop a prognostic tool to identify high-risk patients and assist in the formulation of treatment plans. We retrospectively collected 366 severe or critical COVID-19 patients from four centers, including 70 patients who died within 14 days (labeled as high-risk patients) since their initial CT scan and 296 who survived more than 14 days or were cured (labeled as low-risk patients). We developed a 3D densely connected convolutional neural network (termed De-COVID19-Net) to predict the probability of COVID-19 patients belonging to the high-risk or low-risk group, combining CT and clinical information. The area under the curve (AUC) and other evaluation techniques were used to assess our model. The De-COVID19-Net yielded an AUC of 0.952 (95% confidence interval, 0.928-0.977) on the training set and 0.943 (0.904-0.981) on the test set. The stratified analyses indicated that our model's performance is independent of age, sex, and with/without chronic diseases. The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that our model could significantly categorize patients into high-risk and low-risk groups (p < 0.001). In conclusion, De-COVID19-Net can non-invasively predict whether a patient will die shortly based on the patient's initial CT scan with an impressive performance, which indicated that it could be used as a potential prognosis tool to alert high-risk patients and intervene in advance.","Meng, Lingwei; Dong, Di; Li, Liang; Niu, Meng; Bai, Yan; Wang, Meiyun; Qiu, Xiaoming; Zha, Yunfei; Tian, Jie",IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,100,16

Members of minority racial and ethnic groups have experienced disproportionate COVID-19–associated morbidity and mortality (1);however, COVID-19 vaccination coverage is lower in these groups (2). CDC used data from CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD)* to assess disparities in vaccination coverage among persons aged ≥16 years by race and ethnicity during December 14, 2020–May 15, 2021. Measures of coverage included receipt of ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose (i.e., receipt of the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines or 1 dose of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine [Johnson And Johnson]) and full vaccination (receipt of 2 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines or 1 dose of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine). Among 9.6 million persons aged ≥16 years enrolled in VSD during December 14, 2020–May 15, 2021, ≥1-dose coverage was 48.3%, and 38.3% were fully vaccinated. As of May 15, 2021, coverage with ≥1 dose was lower among non-Hispanic Black (Black) and Hispanic persons (40.7% and 41.1%, respectively) than it was among non-Hispanic White (White) persons (54.6%). Coverage was highest among non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) persons (57.4%). Coverage with ≥1 dose was higher among persons with certain medical conditions that place them at higher risk for severe COVID-19 (high-risk conditions) (63.8%) than it was among persons without such conditions (41.5%) and was higher among persons who had not had COVID-19 (48.8%) than it was among those who had (42.4%). Persons aged 18–24 years had the lowest ≥1-dose coverage (28.7%) among all age groups. Continued monitoring of vaccination coverage and efforts to improve equity in coverage are critical, especially among populations disproportionately affected by COVID-19. VSD is a collaboration between CDC’s Immunization Safety Office and eight integrated health care organizations in six U.S. states.† VSD captures information on COVID-19 vaccine doses administered, regardless of where they are received, based on an automated search within the organizations’ facilities (outpatient and inpatient records) and external systems (e.g., health insurance claims and state or local immunization What is already known about this topic?

As of May 15, 2021, 48.3% of persons identified in CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink aged ≥16 years had received ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose and 38.3% were fully vaccinated. Coverage with ≥1 dose was lower among non-Hispanic Black (40.7%) and Hispanic persons (41.1%) than among non-Hispanic White persons (54.6%);coverage was highest (57.4%) among non-Hispanic Asian persons.

As predicted, there are several obstacles for medical and governmental authorities to efficiently manage this respiratory illness. In spite of appropriated supplies, most hospitals are suffering from a scarcity of free beds, protective masks, sanitizing liquids and even ECMO machines for patients with severe cases. Defeating this pandemic is impossible without united and coordinated international attempts shaped by all countries of the world. We believe that an international scaled-determination is required to diminish the complex impacts of pandemic. The most important priorities are supposed to be i) The development of potential vaccine candidates to provide protection and interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, ii) To ensure enough supplies for hospitals and their homogeneous distribution among the countries with the worst number of severe cases, iii) There is a need for more studies to identify potential treatments that are effective for the control of this viral infection and iv) It is imperative to provide easy access to diagnostic kits for all countries affected by this pandemic. In the light of these suggestions, it would be recommendable to at least temporarily abandon the political checkouts in both national and international levels; therefore, all partners will be potentially able to efficiently enforce their strategies for the elimination of this unique threat to the human populations.","Perez Perez, Guillermo I; Talebi Bezmin Abadi, Amin",Arch Med Res,100,12

Its profile in patients with pre-existing chronic liver disease (CLD) is largely unknown. We studied the liver injury patterns of SARS-Cov-2 in CLD patients, with or without cirrhosis. METHODS: Data was collected from 13 Asian countries on patients with CLD, known or newly diagnosed, with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Altogether, 228 patients [185 CLD without cirrhosis and 43 with cirrhosis] were enrolled, with comorbidities in nearly 80%. Metabolism associated fatty liver disease (113, 61%) and viral etiology (26, 60%) were common. In CLD without cirrhosis, diabetes [57.7% vs 39.7%, OR = 2.1 (1.1-3.7), p = 0.01] and in cirrhotics, obesity, [64.3% vs. 17.2%, OR = 8.1 (1.9-38.8), p = 0.002] predisposed more to liver injury than those without these. Forty three percent of CLD without cirrhosis presented as acute liver injury and 20% cirrhotics presented with either acute-on-chronic liver failure [5 (11.6%)] or acute decompensation [4 (9%)]. Liver related complications increased (p < 0.05) with stage of liver disease; a Child-Turcotte Pugh score of 9 or more at presentation predicted high mortality [AUROC 0.94, HR = 19.2 (95 CI 2.3-163.3), p < 0.001, sensitivity 85.7% and specificity 94.4%). In decompensated cirrhotics, the liver injury was progressive in 57% patients, with 43% mortality. Rising bilirubin and AST/ALT ratio predicted mortality among cirrhosis patients. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-Cov-2 infection causes significant liver injury in CLD patients, decompensating one fifth of cirrhosis, and worsening the clinical status of the already decompensated. The CLD patients with diabetes and obesity are more vulnerable and should be closely monitored.","Sarin, Shiv Kumar; Choudhury, Ashok; Lau, George K; Zheng, Ming-Hua; Ji, Dong; Abd-Elsalam, Sherief; Hwang, Jaeseok; Qi, Xiaolong; Cua, Ian Homer; Suh, Jeong Ill; Park, Jun Gi; Putcharoen, Opass; Kaewdech, Apichat; Piratvisuth, Teerha; Treeprasertsuk, Sombat; Park, Sooyoung; Wejnaruemarn, Salisa; Payawal, Diana A; Baatarkhuu, Oidov; Ahn, Sang Hoon; Yeo, Chang Dong; Alonzo, Uzziel Romar; Chinbayar, Tserendorj; Loho, Imelda M; Yokosuka, Osamu; Jafri, Wasim; Tan, Soeksiam; Soo, Lau Ing; Tanwandee, Tawesak; Gani, Rino; Anand, Lovkesh; Esmail, Eslam Saber; Khalaf, Mai; Alam, Shahinul; Lin, Chun-Yu; Chuang, Wan-Long; Soin, A S; Garg, Hitendra K; Kalista, Kemal; Batsukh, Badamnachin; Purnomo, Hery Djagat; Dara, Vijay Pal; Rathi, Pravin; Al Mahtab, Mamun; Shukla, Akash; Sharma, Manoj K; Omata, Masao",Hepatol Int,100,6

RESULTS: Out of 335 BS patients contacted, fourteen cases of SARS-CoV-2 were identified between April 1st, 2020 and February 9th, 2021, suggesting a prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among BS patients of 4.2%, in line with the data of the general population in Italy (4.4%). When comparing clinical features between SARS-CoV-2 cases and matched SARS-CoV-2 negative BS patients, we found that the presence of different disease manifestations did not significantly differ between the two groups. SARS-CoV-2 cases and controls were also comparable in terms of immunosuppressive therapy, with the only exception of corticosteroids (71.4% vs. 35.7%, p=0.030), whose daily dose was significantly higher in cases than controls [5mg/day (IQR 0-10,) vs. 0 mg/day (IQR 0-5), p=0.005], suggesting that the right timing of usage and the more appropriate dosage of corticosteroid are a key question for the better management of these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, patients with BS do not seem to be at a greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe complications compared with the general population.","Mattioli, I.; Bettiol, A.; Silvestri, E.; Urban, M.

In this context, it is necessary to summarize the features and indications of the different types of masks. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To consult and to compile the different recommendations disseminated by prestigious institutions such as the World Health Organization, the European Center for Disease Prevention, the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine, or the Ministry of Health of the Government of Spain has been reviewed. RESULTS: The institutions consulted recommend reserving FFP respirators for healthcare workers, especially when carrying out aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) (minimum FFP2 protection) and consider some reutilization systems during times of scarcity. The use of surgical masks is recommended to professionals who do not perform AGPs and to the symptomatic population but exist variations in its indications intended for the general healthy population. CONCLUSION: In the context of shortage of personal protective equipment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a prioritization and rationalization of the use of each type of mask should be established according to the user and the activity performed.","Aranaz Andrés, Jesús M; Gea Velázquez de Castro, M Teresa; Vicente-Guijarro, Jorge; Beltrán Peribáñez, Joaquín; García Haro, Mercedes; Valencia-Martín, José Lorenzo; Bischofberger Valdés, Cornelia",J Healthc Qual Res,100,3

OBJECTIVE: To describe and classify the cutaneous findings with supporting histopathology of confirmed COVID-19 inpatients. METHODS: We included consecutive inpatients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 for whom a dermatology consult was requested. A skin biopsy was performed in all cases. Skin findings were classified as being compatible with a cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 or as representing a distinct clinical entity. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were studied in whom thirty-one dermatologic diagnoses were made. Twenty-two of the dermatoses were compatible with a cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19; nine entities were not associated with infection by SARS-CoV-2. The most common COVID-19-associated pattern was an exanthematous presentation. In four patients, a new pattern was observed, characterized by discrete papules with varied histopathological findings including a case of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis. No cases of pernio-like lesions were identified. Skin findings not associated with COVID-19 represented 29% of diagnoses and included Malassezia folliculitis, tinea, miliaria and contact dermatitis. LIMITATIONS: There is no gold-standard test to distinguish between viral exanthems and drug reactions. CONCLUSION: A histopathological study is critical before attributing skin findings to a manifestation of COVID-19.","Barrera-Godínez, A; Méndez-Flores, S; Gatica-Torres, M; Rosales-Sotomayor, A; Campos-Jiménez, K I; Carrillo-Córdova, D M; Durand-Muñoz, M C; Mena-Hernández, G L; Melchor-Mendoza, Y K; Ruelas-Villavicencio, A L; García-Irigoyen, A; Acatitla-Acevedo, G A; Toussaint-Caire, S; Domínguez-Cherit, J",J.

However, non-recyclability of these oxides has restricted their practical applications. In present work, a novel nanostructured composite monoclinic bismuth vanadate@ activated carbon fibers (BiVO4@ACF) photocatalyst was efficaciously synthesized using a solvothermal method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Bruner-Emmett-Teller (BET). The specific surface area, phase composition, microstructure, binding and photocatalytic activity of BiVO4@ACF pose great dependence on solvent nature and chelating agents utilized for synthesis. The photocatalytic and antibacterial potential of this composite was evaluated and optimized by using a model pollutant, Reactive Rhodamine Blue (RhB) and pathogenic microbes (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus). The composite possesses enhanced photocatalytic and antibacterial activity and was reutilized for three rounds of respective reaction without any loss of activity and structure as evident from SEM and XRD results. The photocatalytic mechanism of photodegradation of dye and bactericidal properties of samples under visible light irradiation was determined by scavenger and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The enhanced photocatalytic and antibacterial activity, chemical stability and most importantly good recyclability of BiVO4@ACFs highlight the potential application of this composite in water purification and other biological applications.","Saleem, Aimen; Ahmed, Toheed; Ammar, Muhammad; Zhang, Hong-Ling; Xu, Hong-Bin; Tabassum, Romana",J Photochem Photobiol B,100,6

Along with the DYP intervention, the individuals residing in Chandigarh and Panchkula union territories in the northern part of India were assessed for Ayurveda-based body?mind constitutional type. Ayurveda describes body?mind constitution as ?prakriti,? which has been discussed from two angles, namely physiological and psychological as body and mind are correlated.Methods:Cluster sampling of waitlist control study subjects was used as the sampling method for the study. A total of 1,215 registered subjects (81 diabetic) responded in randomly selected clusters in Chandigarh and Panchkula. Ayurveda physicians did Ayurveda body?mind constitutional assessment called prakriti assessment (physiological body?mind constitution assessment) in 35 participants (23 diabetic, 12 prediabetic) as a part of the study.Results:A group of 50 subjects was randomly selected for yoga intervention out of 81 diabetes mellitus adults, and 31 subjects were enrolled as waitlist controls. A significant decrease in the glycosylated hemoglobin levels from 8.49 ± 1.94% to 7.97 ± 2.20% in the intervention group was noticed.

We reported a 65-years- old male patient with complaints of acute progressive symmetric ascending quadriparesis. Two weeks prior to hospitalization, the patient suffered from cough, fever, and RT-PCR was reported positive for COVID-19 infection. The electrodiagnostic test showed that the patient is an AMSAN variant of GBS. COVID-19 stimulates inflammatory cells and produces various inflammatory cytokines and as a result, it creates immune-mediated processes. GBS is an immune-mediated disorder and molecular mimicry as a mechanism of autoimmune disorder plays an important role in creating it. It is unclear whether COVID-19 induces the production of antibodies against specific gangliosides. Further investigations should be conducted about the mechanism of GBS in patients with COVID-19, in the future.","Sedaghat, Zahra; Karimi, Narges",J Clin Neurosci,100,30

However, adoption of these measures varies greatly. We aimed to improve health messaging to increase adherence to public health behaviours to reduce COVID-19 transmission by: 1) determining attitudes towards public health measures and current behaviours; 2) identifying barriers to following public health measures; and, 3) identifying public health communication strategies. We recruited participants from a random panel of 3000 phone numbers across Alberta to fill a predetermined quota: age (18-29; 30-59; 60+ years), geographic location (urban; rural), and whether they had school-age children. Two researchers coded and themed all transcripts. We performed content analysis and in-depth thematic analysis. Nine focus groups were conducted with 2-8 participants/group in August-September, 2020. Several themes were identified: 1) importance of public health measures; 2) compliance with public health measures; 3) critiques of public health messaging; and 4) suggestions for improving public health messaging. Physical distancing and masking were seen as more important than using a contact tracing app. There were mixed views around willingness to take COVID-19 vaccine. Current public health messaging was perceived as conflicting. Participants felt that consistent messaging and using social media to reach younger people would be helpful. In conclusion, these findings provide insights that can be used to inform targeted (e.g., by age, current behaviour) public health communications to encourage behaviors that reduce COVID-19 transmission.","Benham, Jamie L; Lang, Raynell; Kovacs Burns, Katharina; MacKean, Gail; Léveillé, Tova; McCormack, Brandi; Sheikh, Hasan; Fullerton, Madison M; Tang, Theresa; Boucher, Jean-Christophe; Constantinescu, Cora; Mourali, Mehdi; Oxoby, Robert J; Manns, Braden J; Hu, Jia; Marshall, Deborah A",PLoS One,100,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: With IRB approval, we identified 23 consecutive men with stage 1 testicular cancer (diagnosed after orchiectomy) undergoing surveillance with unenhanced MRI of the abdomen and pelvis. Three blinded radiologists (2 inexperienced R1/R2 and 1 experienced R3) independently assessed MRI for: presence, location and size of abnormal lymph nodes and degree of confidence (5-point Likert scale) in diagnosis. Diagnostic accuracy was tabulated and compared between groups using ROC. Inter-observer agreement was assessed using Cohen's kappa statistic. RESULTS: 17.4% (4/23) men developed 6 metastatic lymph nodes (reference standard: interval development from baseline, size > 1.0 cm short axis). R1 and R2 detected 75% (3/4) patients with abnormal lymph nodes, compared to R3 who detected all four cases. False positive interpretations occurred in: 5.2% (1/19) R1, 10.5% (2/19) R2 and no patients for R3.

However, most Î³-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) used to achieve pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling are at the basic research or preclinical stage, limiting the translation of fundamental findings into clinical practice. This present study aimed to evaluate the potential of several clinical candidates of GSIs as browning agents for the treatment of obesity. METHODS: Seven GSIs that are clinical candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease or cancer were selected and their impacts on Notch inhibition as well as promoting beige biogenesis were compared using in vitro culture of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. RESULTS: Four compounds (i.e.RO4929097, PF-03084014, LY3039478, and BMS-906024) that efficiently inhibited the expression of Notch target genes in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were identified. Moreover, these compounds were optimized for dose-dependent effects at three gradient concentrations (0.5, 1, and 10 µM) to promote beige adipogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes without causing severe cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings not only highlight the potential of cross-therapeutic application of these GSIs for obesity treatment via inhibition of Î³-secretase-mediated processing of Notch signaling, but also provide important experimental evidence to support further design and development of clinically translatable Notch-inhibiting drug delivery systems.","Huang, Di; Qiu, Jiamin; Kuang, Shihuan; Deng, Meng",Pharm Res,100,26

The COVID-19 pandemic in India has become a public health threat, and if we go by the number of confirmed cases then the situation seems to be a matter of grave concern. According to real-time data, the numbers of confirmed cases are growing exponentially. No doubt, substantial public health interventions both at the national and state levels are implemented immediately by the Government of India; there is a need for improved preparedness plans and mitigation strategies along with accurate forecasting. The present study aims to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak infected cases in India. The data have been obtained from https://www.covid19india.org, https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus, and ICMR reported publicly available information about COVID-19 confirmation cases. We have used the double exponential smoothing method for forecasting the trends in terms of confirmed, active, recovered and death cases from COVID-19 for emergency preparedness and future predictions. Findings reveal that the estimated value of point forecast is just 8.22% of the total number of confirmed cases reported on a daily basis across the country. It was observed that the deaths were lower for the states and union territories with a higher detection rate. It is suggested that by keeping in view the limited healthcare resources in the country, accurate forecasting, early detection, and avoidance of acute care for the majority of infected cases is indispensable.","Dwivedi, Rinshu; Athe, Ramesh; Mahesh, Kavi; Modem, Praveen Kumar",J Public Aff,100,16

No clinical methods currently exist to enhance aged HSC function, and little is known regarding how aging affects molecular responses of HSCs to biological stimuli. Exposure of HSCs from young fish, mice, nonhuman primates, and humans to 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (dmPGE2) enhances transplantation, but the effect of dmPGE2 on aged HSCs is unknown. Here we show that ex vivo pulse of bone marrow cells from young adult (3 mo) and aged (25 mo) mice with dmPGE2 prior to serial competitive transplantation significantly enhanced long-term repopulation from aged grafts in primary and secondary transplantation (27 % increase in chimerism) to a similar degree as young grafts (21 % increase in chimerism; both p < 0.05). RNA sequencing of phenotypically-isolated HSCs indicated that the molecular responses to dmPGE2 are similar in young and old, including CREB1 activation and increased cell survival and homeostasis. Common genes within these pathways identified likely key mediators of HSC enhancement by dmPGE2 and age-related signaling differences. HSC expression of the PGE2 receptor EP4, implicated in HSC function, increased with age in both mRNA and surface protein. This work suggests that aging does not alter the major dmPGE2 response pathways in HSCs which mediate enhancement of both young and old HSC function, with significant implications for expanding the therapeutic potential of elderly HSC transplantation.","Patterson, Andrea M; Plett, P Artur; Sampson, Carol H; Simpson, Edward; Liu, Yunlong; Pelus, Louis M; Orschell, Christie M",,100,21

This caused huge disruption to care provision and family carers were relied upon to assume this care at home. Many family carers, including those in employment, found themselves navigating additional care responsibilities without 'usual levels' of support from family, friends, work, school, day care services, homecare and community services. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on family carers, their employment and care-giving responsibilities, through the lens of the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory (Hobfoll, 1989). Adopting a qualitative research approach, 16 family carers (14 females, 2 males) who were in employment prior to the onset of or during the pandemic, participated in an in-depth, semi-structured telephone or online video interview between June and September 2020. Interviews lasted between 45 and 100 min, were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. A thematic analysis of the interview data identified four main themes: colliding worlds; navigating unchartered waters alone; opportunity despite adversity and the relentless unknowing. Findings indicate that the onset of the pandemic resulted in the sudden loss of valued resources, which disrupted routines and caused care and work life domains to become intrinsically intertwined. Consistent with the main principles of the COR theory, adapting and transitioning to different ways of working and caring with depleted resources and supports, generated considerable stress for family carers and impacted their well-being. The implications for employers, healthcare providers, policy makers and other key stakeholders are considered, to enable family carers to successfully reconcile work with care and protect their well-being, as the pandemic continues to unfold and in the event of future societal crises.","Lafferty, Attracta; Phillips, Dominique; Dowling-Hetherington, Linda; Fahy, Majella; Moloney, Breda; Duffy, Clare; Paul, Gillian; Fealy, Gerard; Kroll, Thilo",Heal. soc. care community,100,16

This pandemic enforced the cancellation or postponement of multiple events, which leads to a reduction in travelling and subsequently there were fewer vehicles on the road, which leads to a decrease in air and water pollution. Road traffic accidents and crime rate had come down suddenly. Due to lockdown, there was a reduction in transportation and industrial activity which allowed Mother Nature to recharge and replenish. Due to lockdown, people spent quality time with their family, fulfilled their hobbies, learnt many new skills and understood the importance of sanitation, hand hygiene and social distancing. This pandemic is a lesson for us to learn many new things. This crisis revealed that there is a need to improve our healthcare system and clinical researches. Immunity of an individual can play an important role to fight these kinds of viral diseases, and these diseases can be avoided by simply following the basic concepts of the Ayurveda.

Sensitivity of antigen tests has been shown to be lower than that of rRT-PCR; however, data to evaluate epidemiologic characteristics that affect test performance are limited. METHODS: Paired mid-turbinate nasal swabs were collected from university students and staff and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using both Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA) and rRT-PCR assay. Specimens positive by either rRT-PCR or antigen FIA were placed in viral culture and tested for subgenomic RNA (sgRNA). Logistic regression models were used to evaluate characteristics associated with antigen results, rRT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values, sgRNA, and viral culture. RESULTS: Antigen FIA sensitivity was 78.9% and 43.8% among symptomatic and asymptomatic participants respectively. Among rRT-PCR positive participants, negative antigen results were more likely among asymptomatic participants (OR 4.6, CI:1.3-15.4) and less likely among participants reporting nasal congestion (OR 0.1, CI:0.03-0.8). rRT-PCR-positive specimens with higher Ct values (OR 0.5, CI:0.4-0.8) were less likely, and specimens positive for sgRNA (OR 10.2, CI:1.6-65.0) more likely, to yield positive virus isolation. Antigen testing was >90% positive in specimens with Ct values <29. Positive predictive value of antigen test for positive viral culture (57.7%) was similar to that of rRT-PCR (59.3%). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 antigen test advantages include low cost, wide availability and rapid turnaround time, making them important screening tests. The performance of antigen tests may vary with patient characteristics, so performance characteristics should be accounted for when designing testing strategies and interpreting results.","Ford, Laura; Lee, Christine; Pray, Ian W; Cole, Devlin; Bigouette, John Paul; Abedi, Glen R; Bushman, Dena; Delahoy, Miranda J; Currie, Dustin W; Cherney, Blake; Kirby, Marie; Fajardo, Geroncio; Caudill, Motria; Langolf, Kimberly; Kahrs, Juliana; Zochert, Tara; Kelly, Patrick; Pitts, Collin; Lim, Ailam; Aulik, Nicole; Tamin, Azaibi; Harcourt, Jennifer L; Queen, Krista; Zhang, Jing; Whitaker, Brett; Browne, Hannah; Medrzycki, Magdalena; Shewmaker, Patricia; Bonenfant, Gaston; Zhou, Bin; Folster, Jennifer; Bankamp, Bettina; Bowen, Michael D; Thornburg, Natalie J; Goffard, Kimberly; Limbago, Brandi; Bateman, Allen; Tate, Jacqueline E; Gieryn, Douglas; Kirking, Hannah L; Westergaard, Ryan; Killerby, Marie",Clin. infect. dis,100,24

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: East London Pancreatic Cancer Epidemiology (EL-PaC-Epidem) Study at Barts Health National Health Service Trust, UK. Linked electronic health records were interrogated on a cohort of participants (age &#8805;18 years), reported with HPB conditions between 1 April 2008 and 6 March 2020. PARTICIPANTS: EL-PaC-Epidem Study participants, alive on 12 February 2020, and living in East London within the previous 6 months (n=15 440). The cohort represents a multi-ethnic population with 51.7% belonging to the non-White background. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: COVID-19 incidence and mortality. RESULTS: Some 226 (1.5%) participants had confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis between 12 February and 12 June 2020, with increased odds for men (OR 1.56; 95% CI 1.2 to 2.04) and Black ethnicity (2.04; 1.39 to 2.95) as well as patients with moderate to severe liver disease (2.2; 1.35 to 3.59). Each additional comorbidity increased the odds of infection by 62%. Substance misusers were at more risk of infection, so were patients on vitamin D treatment. The higher ORs in patients with chronic pancreatic or mild liver conditions, age >70, and a history of smoking or obesity were due to coexisting comorbidities. Increased odds of death were observed for men (3.54; 1.68 to 7.85) and Black ethnicity (3.77; 1.38 to 10.7). Patients having respiratory complications from COVID-19 without a history of chronic respiratory disease also had higher odds of death (5.77; 1.75 to 19). CONCLUSIONS: In this large population-based study of patients with HPB conditions, men, Black ethnicity, pre-existing moderate to severe liver conditions, six common medical multimorbidities, substance misuse and a history of vitamin D treatment independently posed higher odds of acquiring COVID-19 compared with their respective counterparts. The odds of death were significantly high for men and Black people.","Dayem Ullah, Abu Z M; Sivapalan, Lavanya; Kocher, Hemant M; Chelala, Claude",BMJ Open,100,32

However, pandemics like covid-19 require deep learning capabilities at mobile devices (detect respiratory rate using mobile robotics or conduct CT scan using a mobile scanner), which are severely constrained by the limited storage and computation resources at the device level. To solve this problem, we propose a three-tier architecture, including robot layers, edge layers, and cloud layers. We adopt this architecture to design a non-contact respiratory monitoring system to break down respiratory rate calculation tasks. Experimental results of respiratory rate monitoring show that the proposed approach in this paper significantly outperforms other approaches. It is supported by computation time costs with 2.26 ms per frame, 27.48 ms per frame, 0.78 seconds for convolution operation, similarity calculation, processing one-minute length respiratory signals, respectively. And the computation time costs of our three-tier architecture are less than that of edge+cloud architecture and cloud architecture. Moreover, we use our three-tire architecture for CT image diagnosis task decomposition. The evaluation of a CT image dataset of COVID-19 proves that our three-tire architecture is useful for resolving tasks on deep learning networks by edge equipment.

For example, more young adults (ages 18-34) appeared to self-report being inactive and more appeared to sit for > 8 h/day compared to older adults. High sitting time was reported by US adults (>40% sitting > 8 h/day) during April 2020. However, high levels of physical activity (>70% meeting guidelines) were also reported. Since physical activity cannot eliminate the negative health effects of sitting, maintaining activity and limiting sitting during periods of large workplace and societal shifts is encouraged.","Meyer, Jacob; Herring, Matthew; McDowell, Cillian; Lansing, Jeni; Brower, Cassandra; Schuch, Felipe; Smith, Lee; Tully, Mark; Martin, Joel; Caswell, Shane; Cortes, Nelson; Boolani, Ali",Prev Med Rep,100,7

This study evaluates whether the 3-month incidence of pregnancy is higher among women reporting reproductive coercion than similar women reporting no reproductive coercion. We tested this hypothesis in longitudinal data from a sample of African-American women ages 18-24 recruited from community settings in Atlanta, Georgia, US, in 2012-2014 (n = 560). Participants were surveyed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months. To reduce selection bias, we used full matching on 22 baseline variables related to demographics, economic power, risky alcohol use, and gender-based power inequality. We used logistic regression in the matched sample with outcome pregnancy 3 months later, controlling for baseline fertility intentions (n = 482, n = 458, n = 452 at respectively 3, 6, 9 months). At 3 months, 15% of women reported reproductive coercion. At 6 months, 11.3% of women reporting coercion were pregnant vs. 4.6% of matched women reporting no coercion (p = 0.06). Women reporting coercion had 3 times the odds of pregnancy as matched women reporting no coercion (AOR 2.95, 95% CI (1.16, 6.98), p = 0.02). Among women pregnant after coercion, only 15% wanted to be pregnant then or sooner. Women reporting reproductive coercion are at greater risk of unwanted or mistimed pregnancies, and the semen exposure that caused these pregnancies could also transmit STI/HIV. Clinicians should screen patients for reproductive coercion; consider using semen exposure biomarkers such as PSA or Yc-PCR to identify condom sabotage or stealthing; and refer women experiencing reproductive coercion to supportive services.","Rosenbaum, Janet E; DiClemente, Ralph J",Health Serv Outcomes Res Methodol,100,3

Current methods for cognitive assessment tend to be inconvenient, costly and infrequently performed. This is unfortunate because cognitive assessment is an important tool. In the young it can detect atypical development, and in older people it can detect cognitive decline. For both young and old, cognitive assessments can identify problems and trigger interventions for reducing harms (e.g., adverse reactions to drugs) or providing treatment. Serious games for cognitive assessment can potentially be self-administered and played on an on-going basis so as to track cognitive status over time, something that is not practical with current methods. Inspired by this opportunity the BrainTagger team has developed a suite of cognitive assessment games. Studies are being carried out to assess the validity of these games for measuring the cognitive functions that they target, but those studies don't address the issue of whether people will be willing to play the game repeatedly, without supervision, over an extended period of time. Thus we carried out a longitudinal study with BrainTagger. We report on the logistical challenges of running this study with an international team located in Canada and Japan during the COVID19 pandemic. We also report on how the perceived ""fun""of games changed over time. Our games were all versions of Whack-a-mole games, with each game requiring a different cognitive function to distinguish between targets (moles to hit) and distractors (moles to avoid). While the basic Whack-a-mole game is fun to play, having to play the same games again and again over a larger time period appeared to be more challenging than anticipated and motivation and acceptance seemed to gradually decrease over the course of the study. We conclude that addition of gamification features, such as leaderboards and in-game rewards, are needed to sustain enjoyment of our BrainTagger games and likely other games as well. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Urakami, J.; Hu, Y.

Although numerous strategies have tried to reduce inadequate antibiotic prescribing, antibiotics are still prescribed in 60% of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs) cases in Catalonia (Spain). This study aims to explore service users' experiences of ALRTIs, the quality and access to healthcare services, and health education. Selective purposive sampling was carried out, based on a prior definition of participant characteristics. These were sex, age, ethnicity, date of the last ALRTI, number of ALRTIs in the last year, and treatments received. Participants with a previous diagnosis of ALRTIs were recruited from three primary health care centres in Barcelona and one in Tarragona. Twenty-nine interviews were conducted between April and June 2019. A content thematic analysis was performed. Three themes were identified: 1) risk perceptions and help-seeking; 2) treatment preferences and antibiotic use; and 3) relationship dynamics and communication with healthcare professionals. Accounts of service users' sense of autonomy towards their health and power dynamics within the healthcare system were apparent. Supporting service users to become reliable, subjective and agentic experts of their health and bodies could help them to voice their healthcare agendas. Power structures embedded within healthcare, political and economic institutions should be challenged so that healthcare services can be co-developed (with service users) and based on service users' autonomy and horizontal relationships. Special consideration should be paid to the intersection of social vulnerabilities. A concordance approach to prescribing could be key to improve the responsible use of antibiotics and to contribute to the prevention of AMR in primary healthcare. The marketisation of health, and the increased demands of private healthcare in Spain due to the financial pressures on public healthcare as a consequence of the financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic, are a risk for promoting adequate antibiotic prescribing and use.

It has also heavily burdened healthcare professionals and the virus poses serious risks for their personal and professional lives. Therefore, the present study examined the associations between fear of COVID-19 and workplace phobia among doctors in Pakistan during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was conducted among 421 doctors in Pakistan between April 10 and May 25, 2020. The Workplace Phobia Scale (WPS) and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) were the main psychometric instruments used in this study. RESULTS: There was a significant positive relationship between fear of COVID-19 and workplace panic anxiety and workplace avoidance behavior. Significantly higher fear of COVID-19 was found among (i) females compared to males, (ii) doctors with 5 years or less of work experience compared to those with more than 5 years, and (iii) postgraduate trainees compared with other ranks. Two groups (doctors who were above 30 years old and postgraduate trainees) were found to have higher levels of workplace phobia compared to their counterparts. Doctors with severe levels of fear of COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of workplace panic anxiety and workplace avoidance behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with workplace phobia which may negatively affect doctors' performance. Therefore, important steps are needed to protect doctors' health by providing sufficient resources to allay their fears and anxieties which consequently help them in carrying out their frontline duties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Malik, Sadia; Ullah, Irfan; Irfan, Muhammad; Ahorsu, Daniel Kwasi; Lin, Chung-Ying; Pakpour, Amir H; Griffiths, Mark D; Rehman, Ibad Ur; Minhas, Rafia",BMC Public Health,100,24

METHODS: The clinical performance of Euroimmun ELISA SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Wantai SARS-CoV-2 Ab ELISA, and DiaPro COVID-19 IgG confirmation were evaluated in the context of both a retrospective and a prospective analysis of COVID-19 patients. The retrospective analysis included plasma samples from 63 COVID-19 patients and 89 control (pre-pandemic) patients. The prospective study included 203 patients who tested either negative (n = 181) or positive (n = 22) by RT-PCR before serology sampling. RESULTS: The specificity was 92.1 %, 98.9 %, 100 % and 98.9 % and the sensitivity 14 days after onset of symptoms was 95.6 %, 95.6 %, 97.8 % and 95.6 % for Euroimmun IgG, Abbott IgG, Wantai Ab, and DiaPro IgG confirmation SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays, respectively. The low specificity of Euroimmun IgG (for ratio <5) was not confirmed in routine care setting (98.5 % negative agreement).

We investigated the risk of COVID-19 infection and subsequent hospitalisation and death in splenectomized patients. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of all individuals with a microbiologically verified COVID-19 infection in Denmark through December 31, 2020. To each case, we matched three controls on age, sex, and region of residence. We examined the association between previous splenectomy and the risk of COVID-19 infection, hospitalisation, and death using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: We identified 165,623 individuals with a positive COVID-19 test and 493,300 matched controls. Mean age was 38 years. 130 and 422 splenectomies were performed in the COVID-19 positive individuals and controls, respectively.

While improving the different components of these systems has been the focus of numerous studies, estimating the impact of such improvements on the revenue has been overlooked in the literature despite its practical importance. Indeed, quantifying the benefit of a change in a system serves as support for investment decisions. This is a challenging problem as it corresponds to the difference between the generated value and the value that would have been generated keeping the system as before. The latter is not observable. Moreover, the expected impact can be small in relative value. In this paper, we cast the problem as counterfactual prediction of unobserved revenue. The impact on revenue is then the difference between the observed and the estimated revenue. The originality of this work lies in the innovative application of econometric methods proposed for macroeconomic applications to a new problem setting. Broadly applicable, the approach benefits from only requiring revenue data observed for origin-destination pairs in the network of the airline at each day, before and after a change in the system is applied. We report results using real large-scale data from Air Canada. We compare a deep neural network counterfactual predictions model with econometric models.

Meanwhile, host-targeted drugs that inhibit cellular transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) can prevent SARS-CoV-2 from entering cells, and its combination with chloroquine and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitors can limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients with COVID-19. The present article provides an overview of these small-molecule therapeutics based on insights from medicinal chemistry research and focuses on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors, such as the nucleoside analogues remdesivir, favipiravir and ribavirin. This review also covers inhibitors of 3C-like protease (3CLpro), papain-like protease (PLpro) and other potentially innovative active ingredient molecules, describing their potential targets, activities, clinical status and side effects.","Tian, Dengke; Liu, Yuzhi; Liang, Chengyuan; Xin, Liang; Xie, Xiaolin; Zhang, Dezhu; Wan, Minge; Li, Han; Fu, Xueqi; Liu, Hong; Cao, Wenqiang",Biomed Pharmacother,100,26

Nevertheless, robust estimation of the SIR model presents a significant challenge, particularly with limited and possibly noisy data in the initial phase of the pandemic. K-means algorithm is used to perform a cluster analysis of the top ten countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases, to observe if there are any significant differences among countries in terms of robustness. As a result of model variation tests, the robustness of parameter estimates is found to be particularly problematic in developing countries. The incompatibility of parameter estimates with the observed characteristics of COVID-19 is another potential problem. Hence, a series of research questions are visited. We propose a SPE (""Single Parameter Estimation"") approach to circumvent these potential problems if the basic SIR is the model of choice, and we check the robustness of this new approach by model variation and structured permutation tests. Dissemination of quality predictions is critical for policy and decision-makers in shedding light on the next phases of the pandemic.","Senel, Kerem; Ozdinc, Mesut; Ozturkcan, Selcen",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,100,16

The present study aimed to analyze the Healthy School Canteen (HSC) policy and identify challenges of its implementation to improve the school food environment in Iran. METHODS: This mixed method study included two qualitative and quantitative phases. In the qualitative phase, triangulation approach was applied by using semi-structured interviews with key informants, documents review and direct observation. Data content analysis was conducted through policy analysis triangle framework. In the quantitative phase, food items available in 64 canteens of primary schools of Tehran province were gathered. The food's nutrient data were evaluated using their nutrition facts label. The number and proportion of foods that met the criteria based on Iran's HSC guideline and the World Health Organization nutrient profile model for the Eastern Mediterranean Region (WHO-EMR) were determined. RESULTS: The main contextual factors that affected adoption of HSC policy included health (nutritional transition, high prevalence of non-communicable diseases and unhealthy food environment in and around the schools), political (upstream supportive policies and joint memorandums about health children between the Ministry of Health and Medical Education and Ministry of Education), structural (the lack of unified stewardship, inadequate human resource capacity, poor inter-sectional cooperation), economic (school financial problems, poor fiscal supportive of food policies), and socio-cultural (mothers working outside the home, the role of children's peer group, low nutrition knowledge of school principals) factors. Assessment of the school canteens showed that a large proportion of available foods did not comply with the national guidelines (54.7 ± 2.54%) and WHO-EMR model (85.6 ± 2.34%). The main reasons identified for incomplete implementation of the policy were inadequate physical and economic infrastructure to set up standard school canteens, lack of scientific criteria for food categorization, poor monitoring, high price of healthy foods, and conflict of interest among the actors. CONCLUSION: The majority of foods and beverages available in the school canteens did not comply with national and regional standards. Iran HSC policy needs to be improved by using an evidence-based approach and active interaction between all key actors.","Babashahi, Mina; Omidvar, Nasrin; Joulaei, Hassan; Zargaraan, Azizollaah; Zayeri, Farid; Veisi, Elnaz; Doustmohammadian, Azam; Kelishadi, Roya",BMC Public Health,100,23

Common characteristics can predispose these patients to the development of severe respiratory illness, which may be particularly relevant during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: A scoping review was performed to assess the impact of pulmonary comorbidities and adverse respiratory outcomes in HNSCC patients. RESULTS: Advanced age, history of tobacco and alcohol abuse, and cardiopulmonary comorbidities are significant risk factors for the development of adverse respiratory outcomes. Treatment toxicities from radiation or chemoradiation therapy significantly increase these risks. CONCLUSION: Respiratory complications are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality among HNSCC patients, and the COVID-19 pandemic may disproportionately affect this population. Interventions designed to decrease smoking and alcohol use, improve oral hygiene, and aggressively manage medical comorbidities are important to the long-term management and health of these patients.","Silverman, Dustin A; Lin, Chen; Tamaki, Akina; Puram, Sidharth V; Carrau, Ricardo L; Seim, Nolan B; Eskander, Antoine; Rocco, James W; Old, Matthew O; Kang, Stephen Y",Head Neck,100,16

However, little is known about the infectiousness of RT-PCR positive patients who pass undetected by AGT. In a screening setting for mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients with high COVID-19 prevalence (30-40%), 1141 patients were tested using one of five AGTs and RT-PCR. Where the results differed, virus viability in the samples was tested on cell culture (CV-1 cells). The test battery included AGTs by JOYSBIO, Assure Tech, SD Biosensor, VivaChek Biotech and NDFOS. Sensitivities of the ATGs compared to RT-PCR ranged from 42% to 76%. The best test yielded a 76% sensitivity, 97% specificity, 92% positive, and 89% negative predictive values, respectively. However, in the best performing ATG tests, almost 90% of samples with ""false negative"" AGT results contained no viable virus. Corrected on the virus viability, sensitivities grew to 81-97% and, with one exception, the tests yielded high specificities >96%. Performance characteristics of the best test after adjustment were 96% sensitivity, 97% specificity, 92% positive, and 99% negative predictive values (high prevalence population). We, therefore, believe that virus viability should be considered when assessing the AGT performance. Also, our results indicate that a well-performing antigen test could in a high-prevalence setting serve as an excellent tool for identifying patients shedding viable virus. We also propose that the high proportion of RT-PCR-positive samples containing no viable virus in the group of ""false negatives"" of the antigen test should be further investigated with the aim of possibly preventing needless isolation of such patients.","Homza, Miroslav; Zelena, Hana; Janosek, Jaroslav; Tomaskova, Hana; Jezo, Eduard; Kloudova, Alena; Mrazek, Jakub; Svagera, Zdenek; Prymula, Roman",Viruses,100,1

We hypothesized that methylene blue (MB) photochemical treatment, which has various clinical applications, could decontaminate PPE contaminated with coronavirus. DESIGN: The 2 arms of the study included (1) PPE inoculation with coronaviruses followed by MB with light (MBL) decontamination treatment and (2) PPE treatment with MBL for 5 cycles of decontamination to determine maintenance of PPE performance. METHODS: MBL treatment was used to inactivate coronaviruses on 3 N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) and 2 medical mask models. We inoculated FFR and medical mask materials with 3 coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and we treated them with 10 µM MB and exposed them to 50,000 lux of white light or 12,500 lux of red light for 30 minutes. In parallel, integrity was assessed after 5 cycles of decontamination using multiple US and international test methods, and the process was compared with the FDA-authorized vaporized hydrogen peroxide plus ozone (VHP+O3) decontamination method. RESULTS: Overall, MBL robustly and consistently inactivated all 3 coronaviruses with 99.8% to >99.9% virus inactivation across all FFRs and medical masks tested. FFR and medical mask integrity was maintained after 5 cycles of MBL treatment, whereas 1 FFR model failed after 5 cycles of VHP+O3. CONCLUSIONS: MBL treatment decontaminated respirators and masks by inactivating 3 tested coronaviruses without compromising integrity through 5 cycles of decontamination. MBL decontamination is effective, is low cost, and does not require specialized equipment, making it applicable in low- to high-resource settings.","Lendvay, Thomas Sean; Chen, James; Harcourt, Brian H; Scholte, Florine E M; Lin, Ying Ling; Kilinc-Balci, F Selcen; Lamb, Molly M; Homdayjanakul, Kamonthip; Cui, Yi; Price, Amy; Heyne, Belinda; Sahni, Jaya; Kabra, Kareem B; Lin, Yi-Chan; Evans, David; Mores, Christopher N; Page, Ken; Chu, Larry F; Haubruge, Eric; Thiry, Etienne; Ludwig-Begall, Louisa F; Wielick, Constance; Clark, Tanner; Wagner, Thor; Timm, Emily; Gallagher, Thomas; Faris, Peter; Macia, Nicolas; Mackie, Cyrus J; Simmons, Sarah M; Reader, Susan; Malott, Rebecca; Hope, Karen; Davies, Jan M; Tritsch, Sarah R; Dams, Lorène; Nauwynck, Hans; Willaert, Jean-Francois; De Jaeger, Simon; Liao, Lei; Zhao, Mervin; Laperre, Jan; Jolois, Olivier; Smit, Sarah J; Patel, Alpa N; Mayo, Mark; Parker, Rod; Molloy-Simard, Vanessa; Lemyre, Jean-Luc; Chu, Steven",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,100,16

The drug is known to have low oral bioavailability (37%) which may be attributed to its relatively high molecular weight, low solubility, dissolution rate, and incomplete intestinal absorption. To overcome these drawbacks, liquid (L) and solid (S) self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDs) of AZM were developed and optimized. Eight different pseudo-ternary diagrams were constructed based on the drug solubility and the emulsification studies in various SEDDs excipients at different surfactant to co-surfactant (Smix) ratios. Droplet size (DS) < 150 nm, dispersity (D) &#8804; 0.7, and transmittance (T)% > 85 in three diluents of distilled water (DW), 0.1 mM HCl, and simulated intestinal fluids (SIF) were considered as the selection criteria. The final formulations of L-SEDDs (L-F1(H)), and S-SEDDs (S-F1(H)) were able to meet the selection requirements. Both formulations were proven to be cytocompatible and able to open up the cellular epithelial tight junctions (TJ). The drug dissolution studies showed that after 5 min > 90% and 52.22% of the AZM was released from liquid and solid SEDDs formulations in DW, respectively, compared to 11.27% of the pure AZM, suggesting the developed SEDDs may enhance the oral delivery of the drug.

However, despite their successes, participants ultimately remained unable to sing in chorus due to network constraints. We draw on theories of liveness from performance studies to explain our findings, arguing that HCI might orientate itself to online liveness as being co-produced through rich participatory structures that dissolve traditional distinctions between live and recorded and performer and audience. We discuss how participants appropriated existing platforms to achieve this, but these in turn shaped their practices in unforeseen ways.

COVID-19 pneumonia sometimes leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), during which thrombosis and bleeding are major causes of death. Anticoagulation such as heparin is essential for COVID-19 patients on ECMO; however, bleeding might be caused by not only heparin, but also acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS). To date, no study has examined ECMO-related bleeding and AVWS in COVID-19 patients.We report a COVID-19 patient who experienced bleeding from AVWS in addition to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) during ECMO. The level of high-molecular weight VWF multimers decreased during ECMO therapy, and these findings promptly improved after discontinuation of ECMO. Plasma levels of VWF antigen were extremely high, probably due to endothelial cell damage caused by COVID-19. On the other hand, plasma levels of ADAMTS13 activity were moderately reduced, to 20-30% of normal. The patient was successfully treated with cryoprecipitate in bleeding during ECMO without a reduction in heparin, which might have induced thromboembolism. Bleeding found in this patient might be caused by AVWS and DIC.Severe COVID-19 patients are in a thrombotic state and need to receive anticoagulant therapy. However, once they receive ECMO therapy, bleeding symptoms could be observed. In such cases, physicians should think of AVWS in addition to the side effect of heparin and DIC.","Hayakawa, Masaki; Takano, Keisuke; Kayashima, Michinori; Kasahara, Kei; Fukushima, Hidetada; Matsumoto, Masanori",J. atheroscler. thromb,100,28

The pandemic also brought to the fore certain social practices resulting from individual behaviors, such as wearing a mask and practicing social isolation. It demonstrated the need for social commitment and pro-social behaviors if societies are to respond successfully. The purpose of this article is to evaluate psychological and sociodemographic characteristics associated with compliance or noncompliance of individuals with these practices in two different phases of the pandemic experience in Brazil: in the first month and after three months. Participants for the first phase of the study were recruited through advertisements in the media and social networks. 1,914 individuals aged between 14 and 81 years agreed to participate, 78.2% of these were women, from 25 Federative Units in Brazil. In the second phase, 761 individuals who participated in the first phase, were reassessed. The authors used the following instruments for data collection: a standardized questionnaire collecting information of sociodemographic characteristics and dynamics of social isolation;the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale;the Life Satisfaction Scale;the Positive and Negative Affections Scale;and the Reduced Personality Markers and Stress Mindset Scale. All instruments used presented evidence of validity and adequate reliability indexes. The comparison of categorical exploratory variables with motives for following social isolation protocols was performed using Pearson's Chi-square, and the comparison of continuous exploratory variables was performed using the Mann-Whitney test. Covariance Analysis was performed using as covariates those that showed significance/effect on isolation in previous analyses. The results showed that respondents practicing social isolation to comply with governmental recommendations had lower scores on the scales of neuroticism and conscientiousness. They reported also less stress, anxiety, and depression, and less general distress. Overall, these respondents also displayed more positive affect, and tended to reframe stress in a more positive way than others. These preliminary results describe the psychological characteristics of individuals and their associations with social behaviors in a period of collective stress and high social risk.","Zanini, D.

In addition to locating the camera for a good view of the manipulated object, our autonomous camera takes into account workspace constraints, including the horizon and safety constraints. We developed a simulation environment to test our method on the""wire chaser""surgical training task from validated training curricula in conventional laparoscopy and robot-assisted surgery. Furthermore, we propose, for the first time, the application of the proposed autonomous camera method in video-based surgical skill assessment, an area where videos are typically recorded using fixed cameras. In a study with N=30 human subjects, we show that video examination of the autonomous camera view as it tracks the ring motion over the wire leads to more accurate user error (ring touching the wire) detection than when using a fixed camera view, or camera movement with a fixed orientation. Our preliminary work suggests that there are potential benefits to autonomous camera positioning informed by scene orientation, and this can direct designers of automated endoscopes and surgical robotic systems, especially when using chip-on-tip cameras that can be wristed for 6-DoF motion.","Abdelaal, Alaa Eldin; Hong, Nancy; Avinash, Apeksha; Budihal, Divya; Sakr, Maram; Hager, Gregory D.; Salcudean, Septimiu E.",,100,16

METHODS: The participants were workers at hospitals designated to treat COVID-19 who completed a questionnaire about their perceptions related to COVID-19, work experience during the previous MERS-CoV outbreak, and symptoms of PTSD ascertained by the PTSD Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Participants' characteristics were compared using the chi-square test. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate the associations between perceptions and the prevalence of PTSD, stratified by occupational type and previous MERS-CoV experience. RESULTS: Non-medical personnel showed stronger associations with PTSD than medical personnel according to general fear (odds ratio [OR], 6.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.92 to 23.20), shortages of supplies (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.56), and issue-specific fear (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.59). Those with prior MERS-CoV quarantine experience were more prone to PTSD than those without such experience in terms of general fear (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.37), shortages of supplies (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.40), and issue-specific fear (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.38). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, non-medical personnel tended to have higher odds of being categorized as having PTSD. Workers with prior MERS-CoV experience were more susceptible than those without such experience. These findings suggest the need for timely interventions to manage human resources for a sustainable quarantine system.","Lee, Youngrong; Kim, Kwanghyun; Park, Sungjin; Jung, Sun Jae",J Prev Med Public Health,100,30

For the first time, the results of our study suggested that vaccination with BCG may increase the risk for COVID-19 at certain age, particularly in individuals vaccinated at childhood. Childhood BCG vaccination increased the likelihood of being diagnosed with COVID-19 fivefold in COVID-19 low-incidence countries and threefold in high-incidence countries. A reasonable explanation for this effect is the activation of certain innate immunity mechanisms associated with inflammatory reactions. These factors should be considered when analysing the risks associated with this global pandemic.","de la Fuente, José; Armas, Octavio; Sánchez-Rodríguez, Luis; Gortázar, Christian; Lukashev, Alexander N",Transbound. emerg. dis.

Aspirin use is associated with better outcomes among COVID-19 positive patients. We hypothesized that the aspirin use for primary cardiovascular disease prevention might have a protective effect on COVID-19 susceptibility and disease duration. We conducted a retrospective population-based cross-sectional study, utilizing data from the Leumit Health Services database. The proportion of patients treated with aspirin was significantly lower among the COVID-19-positive group, as compared to the COVID-19-negative group [73 (11.03%) vs. 1548 (15.77%); P = 0.001]. Aspirin use was associated with lower likelihood of COVID-19 infection, as compared to nonusers (adjusted OR 0.71 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.99; P = 0.041). Aspirin users were older (68.06 ± 12.79 vs. 56.63 ± 12.28 years of age; P < 0.001), presented a lower BMI (28.77 ± 5.4 vs. 30.37 ± 4.55; P < 0.0189), and showed higher prevalence of hypertension (56, 76.71%), diabetes (47, 64.38%), and COPD (11, 15.07%) than the aspirin nonusers (151, 25.64%, P < 0.001; 130, 22.07%, P < 0.001; and 43, 7.3%, P = 0.023, respectively). Moreover, COVID-19 disease duration (considered as the time between the first positive and second negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test results) among aspirin users was significantly shorter, as compared to aspirin nonusers (19.8 ± 7.8 vs. 21.9 ± 7.9 P = 0.045). Among hospitalized COVID-positive patients, a higher proportion of surviving subjects were treated with aspirin (20, 19.05%), as opposed to 1 dead subject (14.29%), although this difference was not significant (P = 0.449). In conclusion, we observed an inverse association between the likelihood of COVID-19 infection, disease duration and mortality, and aspirin use for primary prevention.","Merzon, Eugene; Green, Ilan; Vinker, Shlomo; Golan-Cohen, Avivit; Gorohovski, Alessandro; Avramovich, Eva; Frenkel-Morgenstern, Milana; Magen, Eli",FEBS j,100,3

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 84 patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed from January 23, 2020 to February 19, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups: severe group (n = 23) and non-severe group (n = 61). Clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and CT findings on admission were analyzed. CT quantitative parameters, including GGO, consolidation, total lesion score, percentage GGO, and percentage consolidation (both relative to total lesion volume) were calculated. Relationships between the CT findings and laboratory data were estimated. Finally, a discrimination model was established to assess the severity of COVID-19. RESULTS: Patients in the severe group had higher baseline neutrophil percentage, increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and procalcitonin levels, and lower baseline lymphocyte count and lymphocyte percentage (p < 0.001). The severe group also had higher GGO score (p < 0.001), consolidation score (p < 0.001), total lesion score (p < 0.001), and percentage consolidation (p = 0.002), but had a lower percentage GGO (p = 0.008). These CT quantitative parameters were significantly correlated with laboratory inflammatory marker levels, including neutrophil percentage, lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, hs-CRP level, and procalcitonin level (p < 0.05). The total lesion score demonstrated the best performance when the data cut-off was 8.2%. Furthermore, the area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity were 93.8% (confidence interval [CI]: 86.8-100%), 91.3% (CI: 69.6-100%), and 91.8% (CI: 23.0-98.4%), respectively. CONCLUSION: CT quantitative parameters showed strong correlations with laboratory inflammatory markers, suggesting that CT quantitative analysis might be an effective and important method for assessing the severity of COVID-19, and may provide additional guidance for planning clinical treatment strategies.","Sun, Dong; Li, Xiang; Guo, Dajing; Wu, Lan; Chen, Ting; Fang, Zheng; Chen, Linli; Zeng, Wenbing; Yang, Ran",Korean J Radiol,100,16

Seventy-four COVID-19 positive and 228 COVID-19 negative patients were evaluated with routine haematological parameters. Severe disease was defined as death and/or need of intensive care treatment. Twenty-seven COVID-19 positive and 18 COVID-19 negative patients were furthermore included for morphological evaluation using smear examination. Significant differences were found for platelet indices and white blood cell parameters. Thus, platelet count and plateletcrit was lower in COVID-19 patients, whilst mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, and platelet large cell ratio was significantly higher than in non-COVID-19 patients. Leukocyte, neutrophil, immature granulocyte, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil, and basophil count was lower in COVID-19 patients. No significant differences were found for red blood cell count, haemoglobin, haematocrit or mean corpuscular haemoglobin for COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients with a severe disease course had higher levels of immature granulocytes, but lower lymphocyte and platelet counts compared to patients with non-severe COVID-19. In terms of morphology, 14.8% of COVID-19 patients had a normal smear examination, compared to 83.3% of non-COVID-19 patients. Hypogranulated neutrophils were more frequent in COVID-19 patients (p < .001), but non-COVID-19 patients had higher levels of reactive lymphocytes, compared to COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, several haematological morphological abnormalities are more frequent in patients with COVID-19 disease, and several findings indicate that platelets play a fundamental role in the pathophysiology of the disease.","Alnor, Anne; Sandberg, Maria Boysen; Toftanes, Barbara Ella; Vinholt, Pernille Just",Scand J Clin Lab Invest,100,1

RBC loading with drugs can be performed in several ways—either via encapsulation within the RBC or surface coupling, and either ex vivo or in vivo—depending on the intended application. In this review, we briefly summarize currently used technologies for RBC loading/coupling with an eye on how pharmacokinetics is impacted. Additionally, we provide a detailed description of key ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination) changes that would be expected for RBC-associated drugs and address unique features of RBC pharmacokinetics. As thorough understanding of pharmacokinetics is critical in successful translation to the clinic, we expect that this review will provide a jumping off point for further investigations into this area.","Glassman, Patrick M.; Villa, Carlos H.; Ukidve, Anvay; Zhao, Zongmin; Smith, Paige; Mitragotri, Samir; Russell, Alan J.; Brenner, Jacob S.; Muzykantov, Vladimir R.",Pharmaceutics,100,25

Our objective was to investigate the incidence, time course, laboratory features, and in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 patients with suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE). METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who had undergone ultrasound imaging for suspected VTE from March 13 to May 18, 2020. The medical records of the included patients were reviewed for D-dimer, fibrinogen, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, platelet count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and high-sensitivity troponin T at admission and at up to seven time points before and after ultrasound examination. The clinical outcomes included superficial venous thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, intubation, and death. Mixed effects logistic, linear, and Cox proportional hazards methods were used to evaluate the relationships between the laboratory markers and VTE and other in-hospital outcomes. RESULTS: Of 138 patients who had undergone imaging studies, 44 (31.9%) had evidence of VTE. On univariable analysis, an elevated admission CRP (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.09; P = .02; per 10-U increase in CRP), platelet count (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.04-2.12; P = .03; per 1000-U increase in platelet count), and male sex (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.19-5.84; P = .02), were associated with VTE. However only male sex remained significant on multivariable analysis (OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.01-5.56; P = .048). The independent predictors of death included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.07; P = .04), active malignancy (HR, 4.39; 95% CI, 1.39-13.91; P = .01), elevated admission D-dimer (HR, 1.016; 95% CI, 1.003-1.029; P = .02), and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (HR, 4.81; 95% CI, 1.76-13.10; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Male sex, elevated CRP, and elevated platelet count at admission were associated with VTE on univariable analysis. However, only male sex remained significant on multivariable analysis. Older age, active malignancy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and elevated D-dimer at admission were independently associated with death for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","Thondapu, Vikas; Montes, Daniel; Rosovsky, Rachel; Dua, Anahita; McDermott, Shaunagh; Lu, Michael T; Ghoshhajra, Brian; Hoffmann, Udo; Gerhard-Herman, Marie Denise; Hedgire, Sandeep",J.

We aimed to investigate whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were associated with a decreased risk of symptomatic and asymptomatic reinfection. METHODS: A large, multicentre, prospective cohort study was done, with participants recruited from publicly funded hospitals in all regions of England. All health-care workers, support staff, and administrative staff working at hospitals who could remain engaged in follow-up for 12 months were eligible to join The SARS-CoV-2 Immunity and Reinfection Evaluation study. Participants were excluded if they had no PCR tests after enrolment, enrolled after Dec 31, 2020, or had insufficient PCR and antibody data for cohort assignment. Participants attended regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing (every 2-4 weeks) and completed questionnaires every 2 weeks on symptoms and exposures. At enrolment, participants were assigned to either the positive cohort (antibody positive, or previous positive PCR or antibody test) or negative cohort (antibody negative, no previous positive PCR or antibody test). The primary outcome was a reinfection in the positive cohort or a primary infection in the negative cohort, determined by PCR tests. Potential reinfections were clinically reviewed and classified according to case definitions (confirmed, probable, or possible) and symptom-status, depending on the hierarchy of evidence. Primary infections in the negative cohort were defined as a first positive PCR test and seroconversions were excluded when not associated with a positive PCR test. A proportional hazards frailty model using a Poisson distribution was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) to compare infection rates in the two cohorts. FINDINGS: From June 18, 2020, to Dec 31, 2020, 30 625 participants were enrolled into the study. 51 participants withdrew from the study, 4913 were excluded, and 25 661 participants (with linked data on antibody and PCR testing) were included in the analysis. Data were extracted from all sources on Feb 5, 2021, and include data up to and including Jan 11, 2021. 155 infections were detected in the baseline positive cohort of 8278 participants, collectively contributing 2 047 113 person-days of follow-up. This compares with 1704 new PCR positive infections in the negative cohort of 17 383 participants, contributing 2 971 436 person-days of follow-up. The incidence density was 7·6 reinfections per 100 000 person-days in the positive cohort, compared with 57·3 primary infections per 100 000 person-days in the negative cohort, between June, 2020, and January, 2021. The adjusted IRR was 0·159 for all reinfections (95% CI 0·13-0·19) compared with PCR-confirmed primary infections. The median interval between primary infection and reinfection was more than 200 days. INTERPRETATION: A previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an 84% lower risk of infection, with median protective effect observed 7 months following primary infection. This time period is the minimum probable effect because seroconversions were not included. This study shows that previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 induces effective immunity to future infections in most individuals.

Most countries are well connected on a global scale, making it nearly impossible to implement perfect and prompt mitigation strategies for infectious disease outbreaks. In particular, due to the explosive growth of international travel, the complex network of human mobility enabled the rapid spread of COVID-19 globally. OBJECTIVE: South Korea was one of the earliest countries to be affected by COVID-19. In the absence of vaccines and treatments, South Korea has implemented and maintained stringent interventions, such as large-scale epidemiological investigations, rapid diagnosis, social distancing, and prompt clinical classification of severely ill patients with appropriate medical measures. In particular, South Korea has implemented effective airport screenings and quarantine measures. In this study, we aimed to assess the country-specific importation risk of COVID-19 and investigate its impact on the local transmission of COVID-19. METHODS: The country-specific importation risk of COVID-19 in South Korea was assessed. We investigated the relationships between country-specific imported cases, passenger numbers, and the severity of country-specific COVID-19 prevalence from January to October 2020. We assessed the country-specific risk by incorporating country-specific information. A renewal mathematical model was employed, considering both imported and local cases of COVID-19 in South Korea. Furthermore, we estimated the basic and effective reproduction numbers. RESULTS: The risk of importation from China was highest between January and February 2020, while that from North America (the United States and Canada) was high from April to October 2020. The R0 was estimated at 1.87 (95% CI 1.47-2.34), using the rate of &#945;=0.07 for secondary transmission caused by imported cases. The Rt was estimated in South Korea and in both Seoul and Gyeonggi. CONCLUSIONS: A statistical model accounting for imported and locally transmitted cases was employed to estimate R0 and Rt. Our results indicated that the prompt implementation of airport screening measures (contact tracing with case isolation and quarantine) successfully reduced local transmission caused by imported cases despite passengers arriving from high-risk countries throughout the year. Moreover, various mitigation interventions, including social distancing and travel restrictions within South Korea, have been effectively implemented to reduce the spread of local cases in South Korea.","Lee, Hyojung; Kim, Yeahwon; Kim, Eunsu; Lee, Sunmi",JMIR Public Health Surveill,100,1

Recent findings indicate the presence of COVID-19 in patients with irregular findings on chest X-rays. There are many reports on this topic that include machine learning strategies for the identification of COVID-19 using chest X-rays. Other current studies have used non-public datasets and complex artificial intelligence (AI) systems. In our research, we suggested a new COVID-19 identification technique based on the locality-weighted learning and self-organization map (LWL-SOM) strategy for detecting and capturing COVID-19 cases. We first grouped images from chest X-ray datasets based on their similar features in different clusters using the SOM strategy in order to discriminate between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. Then, we built our intelligent learning model based on the LWL algorithm to diagnose and detect COVID-19 cases. The proposed SOM-LWL model improved the correlation coefficient performance results between the Covid19, no-finding, and pneumonia cases;pneumonia and no-finding cases;Covid19 and pneumonia cases;and Covid19 and no-finding cases from 0.9613 to 0.9788, 0.6113 to 1 0.8783 to 0.9999, and 0.8894 to 1, respectively. The proposed LWL-SOM had better results for discriminating COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients than the current machine learning-based solutions using AI evaluation measures.","Osman, A.

Although large population datasets, such as phone-based mobility data, may provide some glimpse into such compliance, it is often proprietary, and may not be available for all locales. In this work, we examine the usefulness of video sharing on social media as a proxy of the amount of time Internet users spend at home. In particular, we focus on the number of people sharing YouTube videos on Twitter before and during COVID-19 lockdown measures were imposed by 109 countries. We find that the media sharing behavior differs widely between countries, in some having immediate response to the lockdown decrees - mostly by increasing the sharing volume dramatically - while in others having a substantial lag. We confirm that these insights correlate strongly with mobility, as measured using phone data. Finally, we illustrate that both media sharing and mobility behaviors change more drastically around mandated lockdowns, and less so around more lax recommendations. We make the media sharing volume data available to the research community for continued monitoring of behavior change around public health measures.","Mejova, Yelena; Kourtellis, Nicolas",,100,20

This study aims to present the effect of the promulgation of social distancing measures on the spread of COVID-19 in the cases of 10 highly infected countries. The authors focus on the statistics of the COVID-19 confirmed-cases and deaths in 10 highly infected countries, including The U.S., Spain, Italy, The U.K., France, Germany, Russia, Turkey, Iran and China, and the response to the pandemic of these countries in the period from January 11 to May 2, 2020. The relationships between the social distancing measures and the statistics of COVID-19 confirmed-cases and deaths were analyzed in order to elucidate the effectiveness of the social distancing measures on the spread of COVID-19 in 10 highly infected countries. The results showed it took1-4 weeks since the highest level of social distancing measures promulgation until the daily confirmed-cases and deaths showed signs of decreasing. The effectiveness of the social distancing measures on the spread of COVID-19 was different between the 10 focused countries. This variation is due to the difference in the levels of promulgated social distancing measures, as well as the difference in the COVID-19 spread situation at the time of promulgation between the countries.","Thu, Tran Phuoc Bao; Ngoc, Pham Nguyen Hong; Hai, Nguyen Minh; Tuan, Le Anh",Sci Total Environ,100,7

However, assessing the effectiveness of those intervention practices hinges on the understanding of virus transmission, which remains uncertain. Here we show that airborne transmission is highly virulent and represents the dominant route to spread the disease. By analyzing the trend and mitigation measures in Wuhan, China, Italy, and New York City, from January 23 to May 9, 2020, we illustrate that the impacts of mitigation measures are discernable from the trends of the pandemic. Our analysis reveals that the difference with and without mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping the pandemic trends in the three epicenters. This protective measure alone significantly reduced the number of infections, that is, by over 78,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and over 66,000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9. Other mitigation measures, such as social distancing implemented in the United States, are insufficient by themselves in protecting the public. We conclude that wearing of face masks in public corresponds to the most effective means to prevent interhuman transmission, and this inexpensive practice, in conjunction with simultaneous social distancing, quarantine, and contact tracing, represents the most likely fighting opportunity to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work also highlights the fact that sound science is essential in decision-making for the current and future public health pandemics.","Zhang, Renyi; Li, Yixin; Zhang, Annie L; Wang, Yuan; Molina, Mario J",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,100,19

However, it is unclear what interaction types are associated with outcome-improvement in remote-CBT (rCBT) for SHA. This study aimed to identify interaction types that predict outcomes and sudden gains in rCBT for SHA using initial therapy session content. Forty-eight participants in rCBT for SHA had interactions at their first sessions categorized and rated in terms of patient activation: an individual's confidence and ability to manage their health. Multilevel modelling assessed whether early interaction types predicted session-by-session wellbeing. For participants experiencing sudden gains (n = 12) interactions at the session directly prior to the gain were similarly categorized and rated. The scores were then compared with ratings for the preceding session. A smaller proportion of early sessions was taken up with problem descriptions among those with greater outcome improvements. There was also a significant reduction in the proportion of the session spent describing problems in the session directly prior to a sudden gain, as compared with the previous session. Conversely, clients with better outcomes made more positive evaluations of themselves and therapy, noticed more positive changes and made more contributions to structuring interactions at initial sessions.

Understanding the environmental factors that affect the spread of the disease COVID-19 infection is critical to stop the spread of the disease. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether population density is associated with the infection rate of the COVID-19. We collected data from official webpages of cities in China and in the USA. The data were organized on Excel spreadsheets for statistical analyses. We calculated the morbidity and population density of cities and regions in these two countries. We then examined the relationship between morbidity and other factors. Our analysis indicated that the population density in cities in Hubei province where the COVID-19 was severe was associated with a higher percentage of morbidity, with an r value of 0.62. Similarly, in the USA, the density of 51 states and territories is also associated with morbidity from COVID-19 with an r value of 0.55. In contrast, as a control group, there is no association between the morbidity and population density in 33 other regions of China, where the COVID-19 epidemic is well under control. Interestingly, our study also indicated that these associations were not influenced by the first case of COVID-19. The rate of morbidity and the number of days from the first case in the USA have no association, with an r value of - 0.1288. Population density is positively associated with the percentage of patients with COVID-19 infection in the population. Our data support the importance of such as social distancing and travel restriction in the prevention of COVID-19 spread.","Yin, Heliang; Sun, Tong; Yao, Lan; Jiao, Yan; Ma, Li; Lin, Lin; Graff, J Carolyn; Aleya, Lotfi; Postlethwaite, Arnold; Gu, Weikuan; Chen, Hong",,100,32

Here we studied the stability of Nudaurelia capensis omega virus (N&#969;V) virus-like particles (VLPs) in simulated GI fluids. N&#969;V VLPs capsids and procapsids were transiently expressed in plants, the VLPs were incubated in various simulated GI fluids and their stability was determined by gel electrophoresis, density gradient ultracentrifugation and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that the capsids were highly resistant to simulated gastric fluids at pH &#8805; 3. Even under the harshest conditions, which consisted of a pepsin solution at pH 1.2, N&#969;V capsids remained assembled as VLPs, though some digestion of the coat protein occurred. Moreover, 80.8% (±10.2%) stability was measured for N&#969;V capsids upon 4 h incubation in simulated intestinal fluids. The high resistance of this protein cage to digestion and denaturation can be attributed to its distinctively compact structure. The more porous form of the VLPs, the procapsid, was less stable under all conditions. Our results suggest that N&#969;V VLPs capsids are likely to endure transit through the GI tract, designating them as promising candidate protein nanocages for oral drug delivery.","Berardi, Alberto; Castells-Graells, Roger; Lomonossoff, George P",Eur J Pharm Biopharm,100,6

The use of digital technologies has been seen as an important effort to combat the pandemic and one of such technologies is contact tracing applications. These applications were successfully employed to face other infectious diseases, thus they have been used during the current pandemic. However, the use of contact tracing poses several privacy concerns since it is necessary to store and process data which can lead to the user/device identification as well as location and behavior tracking. These concerns are even more relevant when considering nationwide implementations since they can lead to mass surveillance by authoritarian governments. Despite the restrictions imposed by data protection laws from several countries, there are still doubts on the preservation of the privacy of the users. In this article, we analyze the privacy features in national contact tracing COVID-19 applications considering their intrinsic characteristics.

METHODS: Regional data on SI and SSI certification in the period after the onset of the lockdown (19 March 2020-18 June 2020) were compared to the period immediately before lockdown (1 January 2020-18 March 2020) and to the same periods in 2019. Change documented was compared to post-lockdown reductions in primary and secondary ophthalmic care activity. RESULTS: In 2019, during the 3-month period (19 March 2019-18 June 2019), 115 individuals were certified as sight impaired (SI 36, SSI 75, unspecified 4). Of those certified, 65 were female, 49 male. Principal causes of certification were: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (N = 45), glaucoma (N = 20) and diabetic eye disease (DED) (N = 10). Mean VA, recorded from the better eye of those certified, was 0.96 LogMAR. In the 3 months following the onset of lockdown (19 March 2020-18 June 2020), only 37 individuals were certified (SI 6, SSI 31), 12 female and 25 male. AMD was the most frequent cause of sight impairment (N = 20). There were only two DED certifications and one due to glaucoma. Mean VA in the better eye of those certified was 1.15LogMAR. The numbers of CVI certifications completed following the introduction of COVID-19 lockdown fell by 68%, compared to the 2019 data. There was a significant reduction in the proportion of female certifications (p = 0.01), and in certifications due to glaucoma (p = 0.02). The proportion of those certified as SSI as opposed to SI in the period after the onset of lockdown rose from 68% in 2019 to 84% in 2020. The mean VA of those certified in the period after the onset of lockdown, when compared to those certified in the other three periods, was worse by between 0.21 and 0.19 LogMAR (p = 0.06). Reductions reflected change in overall primary and secondary ophthalmic care activity. CONCLUSIONS: It is inconceivable that COVID-19 has reduced the incidence of sight-threatening eye disease. We must therefore assume that a flood of newly presenting sight loss will present once the pandemic has passed. New presentations will include those who would normally have attended during the lockdown period, and patients who, had they accessed ophthalmic care at the appropriate time, would have been saved from severe levels of blindness. The implications of the predicted increase in demand for medical, social and low vision related services are huge.","Jackson, Jonathan; Silvestri, Giuliana; Stevenson, Michael; Sinton, Janet; Witherow, Jacqueline; McCann, Roseleen; Moutray, Tanya; Cushley, Laura",Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,100,16

We aimed to discover how elderly people coped with the psychological burdens of pandemic and the social isolation in Hungary. METHODS: This study included 589 (441 females) Hungarian individuals, aged 60-83 (M = 68.1, SD = 4.46). We collected online survey data to reach a wide population of elderly. Results of hierarchical linear modelling and structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses established how the current life-changing circumstances, the intolerance of uncertainty, loneliness and social support influence the mental health (e.g. depression, anxiety, well-being) of the elderly. The model was used to explore how adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies mediated the effects. RESULTS: Findings showed that perceived change in mood, social connectedness, and quality of life was negatively affected by catastrophizing and loneliness; whereas positive refocusing and contamination fear had a positive effect. According to the SEM analysis, intolerance of uncertainty and loneliness directly affected mental health. Further, maladaptive emotion regulation strategies mediated the connection between intolerance of uncertainty, contamination fear, loneliness and mental health. Whereas adaptive emotion regulation strategy mediated the connection between social support from friends, contamination fear, loneliness and mental health. CONCLUSION: Overall, our research might help the understanding of how external and internal factors contributed to the well-being of elderly people during the COVID-19. The model can also be translated into professional interventions to develop coping strategies among elderly for the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic in their lives.","Lábadi, Beatrix; Arató, Nikolett; Budai, Tímea; Inhóf, Orsolya; Stecina, Diána T; Sík, Attila; Zsidó, András N",Aging Ment Health,100,20

Commonly, there are exist multiple types of malware infecting a network of computing devices, or different messages can spread over the social network. Information spreading and virus propagation are interdependent processes. To capture such independencies, we integrate two epidemic models into one holistic framework, known as the modified Susceptible-Warned-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SWIRS) model. The first epidemic model describes the information spreading regarding the risk of malware attacks and possible preventive procedures. The second one describes the propagation of multiple viruses over the network of devices. To minimize the impact of the virus spreading and improve the protection of the networks, we consider an optimal control problem with two types of control strategies: information spreading among healthy nodes and the treatment of infected nodes. We obtain the structure of optimal control strategies and study the condition of epidemic outbreaks. The main results are extended to the case of the network of two connected clusters. Numerical examples are used to corroborate the theoretical findings.","Taynitskiy, Vladislav; Gubar, Elena; Fedyanin, Denis; Petrov, Ilya; Zhu, Quanyan",,100,8

We describe an immunocompetent woman with a cutaneous manifestation of Candida parasilopsis fungemia, a prominent eschar, which proved to be the nidus for the candidemia. We stress the value of selectively removing eschars. C. parasilopsis and C. auris are increasingly important causes of sepsis and wound infections. We emphasize that commercially available biochemical-based tests may misidentify C. auris as C. parapsilosis, and stress the added danger of C. auris to critically ill-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Any health care facility with evidence of infection or colonization with C. auris requires very close monitoring, since this fungus is a nosocomial threat comparable to SARS-CoV-2 in its mortality and fomite adhesiveness! Both organisms have the potential to be transmitted as nosocomial pathogens; health care workers need to follow strict CDC guidelines. During this COVID-19 pandemic, every health care facility should closely monitor for the possible deadly combination of the SARS-CoV-2 and C. auris. The identification of C. auris necessitates use of sophisticated technology not readily available to make this essential diagnosis since C. auris is multi-drug resistant and isolation precautions would become paramount.","Schwartz, Robert A; Kapila, Rajendra",Dermatol Ther,100,16

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study conducted during the second phase of the pandemic, adult patients with PNES documented by video-EEG and followed up in two tertiary epilepsy centers responded to a structured telephone survey. Data were gathered on demographics, clinical features and frequency of PNES, history of psychiatric comorbidity, access to treatment, as well as on anxiety (GAD-7 items) and depressive symptoms (NDDI-E). RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (78% female; mean age of 31.36â¯years [SDâ¯=â¯10.6]) were contacted and 15 (28%) reported increased frequency of PNES during the pandemic. Higher scores of GAD-7 items (pâ¯<â¯0.001) and NDDI-E (pâ¯<â¯0.001) were associated with PNES worsening. There was strong evidence of a correlation between higher stress levels (pâ¯<â¯0.001) and poor sleep quality (p 0.005) with PNES aggravation. After regression, stress was the strongest predictor of PNES increased frequency. SIGNIFICANCE: Patients with functional neurological disorders are vulnerable during ubiquitously felt stressors. However, the atmosphere of uncertainty did not affect these patients equally. Patients with PNES showing symptoms of anxiety and depression are at higher risk of seizure worsening. Early identification of this subset of patients may prevent this detrimental outcome.","Valente, Kette D; Alessi, Rudá; Baroni, Gislaine; Marin, Rachel; Dos Santos, Bernardo; Palmini, André",Epilepsy Behav,100,1

Early experience shows that it predominantly affects older age groups with children and young adults being generally more resilient to more severe disease (1-3). From a health standpoint, children and young people are less directly affected than adults and presentation of the disease has shown different characteristics. Nonetheless, COVID-19 has had severe repercussions on children and young people. These indirect, downstream implications should not be ignored. An understanding of the issues is essential for those who hope to advocate effectively for children to prevent irreversible damage to the adults of the future. This article reviews some of the evidence of harm to children that may accrue indirectly as a result of pandemics. It explores the physical and psychological effects, discusses the role of parenting and education, offering practical advice about how best to provide support as a health care professional.","Ashikalli, Louicia; Carroll, Will; Johnson, Christine",,100,1

Among these mutations are amino acid changes N501Y (lineage B.1.1.7, first identified in the UK), and the combination N501Y, E484K, K417N (B.1.351, first identified in South Africa), all located at the interface on the receptor binding domain (RBD). We experimentally establish that RBD containing the N501Y mutation results in 7-fold stronger binding to the hACE2 receptor than wild type RBD. The E484K mutation only slightly enhances the affinity for the receptor, while K417N attenuates affinity. As a result, RBD from B.1.351 containing all three mutations binds 3-fold stronger to hACE2 than wild type RBD but 2-fold weaker than N501Y. However, the recently emerging double mutant E484K/N501Y binds even stronger than N501Y. The independent evolution of lineages containing mutations with different effects on receptor binding affinity, viral transmission and immune evasion underscores the importance of global viral genome surveillance and functional characterization.","Laffeber, Charlie; de Koning, Kelly; Kanaar, Roland; Hg Lebbink, Joyce",J Mol Biol,100,26

The authors describe the rapid rollout of a population health clinical and organizational response in preparedness and capabilities to support the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Italian province of Modena. The authors review the processes, the challenges faced, and describe how excess demand for hospital services was successfully mitigated and thus overwhelming the healthcare services avoided the collapse of the local health care system. An analysis of bed occupancy in the region predicted during the first weeks of the epidemic. The SEIR model estimated the number of infected people under different containment measures. Community resources were mobilized to reduce provincial hospitals' burden of care. A population health approach, based on a radical reorganization of the workflow and emergency patient management, was implemented. The bed saturation of the Modena Healthcare Agency was measured by an ad hoc, newly implemented intensive care unit (ICU) bed occupancy and COVID-19 centralized governance dashboard. ICU bed occupancy increased by 114%, avoiding saturation of the Modena Healthcare Agency system. The Emilia-Romagna region achieved a higher rate of ICU bed availability at 2.15 ICU beds per 10,000 inhabitants as compared with community 1 ICU bed availability prior to the pandemic. Rapid and radical local reorganization of regional efforts helped inform the successful development and implementation of strategic choices within the hospital and the community to prevent the saturation of key facilities.","Romani, Gabriele; Dal Mas, Francesca; Massaro, Maurizio; Cobianchi, Lorenzo; Modenese, Mirko; Barcellini, Amelia; Ricciardi, Walter; Barach, Paul; Lucà, Rossella; Ferrara, Maria",Popul. health manag.

We found that bone marrow cells (BMCs) transplanted from APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice into wild-type (Wt) mice at 3 months of age continuously expressed human Aß in the blood, and caused AD phenotypes including Aß plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), tau hyperphosphorylation, neuronal degeneration, neuroinflammation, and behavioral deficits in the Wt recipient mice at 12 months after transplantation. Bone marrow reconstitution in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice with Wt-BMCs at 3 months of age reduced blood Aß levels, and alleviated brain Aß burden, neuronal degeneration, neuroinflammation, and behavioral deficits in the AD model mice at 12 months after transplantation.

MethodsWe contacted a random sample of the population by sending a letter to named individuals aged 18 or over from the NHS GP registrations list. We then sent respondents a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) kit for SARS-CoV-2 antibody self-testing and asked them to perform the test at home and complete a questionnaire, including reporting of their test result. Overall, 161,537 adults completed questionnaires and self-administered LFIA tests for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 between 27 October and 10 November 2020. ResultsThe overall adjusted and weighted prevalence was 5.6% (95% CI 5.4-5.7). This was an increase from 4.4% (4.3-4.5) in round 3 (September), a relative increase of 26.9% (24.0-29.9).The largest increase by age was in the 18 to 24 year old age group, which increased (adjusted and weighted) from 6.7% (6.3-7.2) to 9.9% (9.3-10.4), and in students, (adjusted, unweighted) from 5.9% (4.8-7.1) to 12.1% (10.8-13.5). Prevalence increased most in Yorkshire and The Humber, from 3.4% (3.0-3.8) to 6.3% (5.9-6.8) and the North West from 4.5% (4.2-4.9) to 7.7% (7.2-8.1). In contrast, the prevalence in London was stable, at 9.5% (9.0-9.9) and 9.5% (9.1-10.0) in rounds 3 and 4 respectively.

This review summarizes the implications of the pandemic on the health and wellness of surgeons and trainees, with a particular focus on those in vascular surgery (VS). A literature review was completed using common resource databases. We provide a brief history of burnout in VS and explore burnout and wellness in VS during this unprecedented pandemic. We then offer recommendations to address mental health needs by the VS workforce and highlight opportunities to address the gaps in the literature. The impact of COVID-19 on the professional and personal lives of surgeons and trainees in VS is notable. More than half of vascular surgeons reported some degree of anxiety. Factors associated with anxiety and burnout include COVID-19 exposure, moral injury, practice changes, and financial impacts. Trainees appeared to have more active coping strategies with dampened rates of anxiety compared to those in practice. Women appear to be disproportionately affected by the pandemic, with higher rates of anxiety and burnout. Groups underrepresented in medicine seemed to have more resilience when it came to burnout, but struggled with other inequities in the health care environment, such as structural racism and isolation. Strategies for addressing burnout include mindfulness practices, exercise, and peer and institutional support. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial mental health impact on the VS workforce globally, as shifts were made in patient care, surgical practice, and work-home life concerns.","Drudi, Laura M; Nishath, Thamanna; Ma, Xiya; Mouawad, Nicolas J; O039,; Banion, Leigh Ann; Shalhub, Sherene",Semin Vasc Surg,100,24

Whereas in the past it referred to the distance between groups in more recent times it signifies the space between individuals. The aspiration for safe space and personal boundaries in recent years indicated that social distancing has acquired an increasingly individuated and privatised form. This article suggests that the demand for safe space can be interpreted as a demand for a quarantine from psychic threats. This pre-existing demand for a quarantine from criticism and pressure has seamlessly meshed with the imperative of social distancing in the COVID-19 era.,"Furedi, Frank",Society,100,20

Because pregnant women are at increased risk for hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mechanical ventilation support, obstetricians will be facing the dilemma of initiating maternal corticosteroid therapy while weighing its potential adverse effects on the fetus (or neonate if the patient is postpartum and breastfeeding).

Functional inhibition of the acid sphingomyelinase using tricyclic antidepressants prevented infection of epithelial cells, for instance with SARS-CoV-2. The structure of ambroxol, i.e. trans-4-[(2,4-dibromanilin-6-yl)-methyamino]-cyclohexanol, a mucolytic drug applied by inhalation, suggests that the drug might inhibit the acid sphingomyelinase, and thereby infection with SARS-CoV-2. To test this, we used spike protein pseudotyped viral particles (pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike), a bona fide system for mimicking SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. Viral uptake and formation of ceramide localization were determined by fluorescence microscopy, activity of the acid sphingomyelinase by consumption of [14C]sphingomyelin and ceramide was quantified by a kinase method. We found that entry of pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike required activation of acid sphingomyelinase and release of ceramide, events that were all prevented by pretreatment with ambroxol. We also obtained nasal epithelial cells from human volunteers prior to and after inhalation of ambroxol. Inhalation of ambroxol reduced acid sphingomyelinase activity in nasal epithelial cells, and prevented pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced acid sphingomyelinase activation, ceramide release, and entry of pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike ex vivo. The addition of purified acid sphingomyelinase or C16 ceramide restored entry of pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike into ambroxol-treated epithelial cells. We propose that ambroxol might be suitable for clinical studies to prevent COVID-19.","Carpinteiro, Alexander; Gripp, Barbara; Hoffmann, Markus; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Hoertel, Nicolas; Edwards, Michael J; Kamler, Markus; Kornhuber, Johannes; Becker, Katrin Anne; Gulbins, Erich",J Biol Chem,100,29

As a result, systems report record losses, while demand for emergency room, hospital, and intensive care beds have surged. Studies have admitted that many surgeries are unnecessary, and physician leaders admit that profit plays a role in driving such needless cost and risk. Most diseases are better managed with medications and lifestyle changes. But it pays more to replace a knee than to prevent that replacement. We must bring surgical and medical value closer in-line. Communities of color are suffering disproportionately from coronavirus. The social determinants of health that lead to higher concentrations of hypertension and diabetes can be mitigated by investment in primary care. Such investment has been proven to decrease cost and increase quality of life. However, the United States spends 50% less on primary care, than other developed countries. While showing promise, telehealth is not a panacea. It relies on continued reimbursement parity, and there remains a digital divide. Any meaningful fix will draw the ire from those who profit from such a profligate system.

In this work, the Spanish labor market was analyzed through the labor force survey (EPA) from a gender perspective, demonstrating the existing inequalities at the labor level, both of employment and unemployment rates, and of jobs where the glass ceiling is evident and of economic remuneration where the salary gap continues to be important. In addition, through an ARIMA model, the evolution of the number of Spanish working women was analyzed, and how the economic crisis of 2009 and the sanitaria have affected their employment in the various crises (COVID-19).

AXL is a candidate receptor for SARS-CoV-2, particularly in the respiratory system, and the GAS6/AXL axis is targeted in current clinical trials against COVID-19. However, GAS6 and TAMs have not been evaluated in COVID-19 patients at emergency admission. METHODS: Plasma GAS6, AXL, and MERTK were analyzed in 132 patients consecutively admitted to the emergency ward during the first peak of COVID-19. RESULTS: GAS6 levels were higher in the SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, increasing progressively with the severity of the disease. Patients with initial GAS6 at the highest quartile had the worst outcome, with a 3-month survival of 65%, compared to a 90% survival for the rest. Soluble AXL exhibited higher plasma concentration in deceased patients, without significant differences in MERTK among SARS-CoV-2-positive groups. GAS6 mRNA was mainly expressed in alveolar cells and AXL in airway macrophages. Remarkably, THP-1 human macrophage differentiation neatly induces AXL, and its inhibition (bemcentinib) reduced cytokine production in human macrophages after LPS challenge.

Those data should have served to answer important clinical questions such as: what are the risk factors for becoming infected? What are good clinical variables to predict prognosis? What kinds of patients are more likely to survive mechanical ventilation? Are there clinical subphenotypes of the disease? All these, and many more, are crucial questions to improve our clinical strategies against the epidemic and save as many lives as possible. One might assume that in the era of big data and machine learning, there would be an army of scientists crunching petabytes of clinical data to answer these questions. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Our health systems have proven to be completely unprepared to generate, in a timely manner, a flow of clinical data that could feed these analyses. Despite gigabytes of data being generated every day, the vast quantity is locked in secure hospital data servers and is not being made available for analysis. Routinely collected clinical data are, by and large, regarded as a tool to inform decisions about individual patients, and not as a key resource to answer clinical questions through statistical analysis. The initiatives to extract COVID-19 clinical data are often promoted by private groups of individuals and not by health systems, and are uncoordinated and inefficient. The consequence is that we have more clinical data on COVID-19 than on any other epidemic in history, but we have failed to analyze this information quickly enough to make a difference. In this viewpoint, we expose this situation and suggest concrete ideas that health systems could implement to dynamically analyze their routine clinical data, becoming learning health systems and reversing the current situation.","Prieto-Merino, D.; Bebiano Da Providencia, E.

Healthcare-acquired infection has been reported in similar epidemics, but there are limited data on the prevalence of COVID-19 among HCWs and their associated clinical outcomes in the United States. METHODS: We established two high-throughput employee testing centers in Seattle, Washington with drive-through and walk-through options for symptomatic employees in the University of Washington Medicine system and its affiliated organizations. Using data from these testing centers, we report the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among symptomatic employees and describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes among employees with COVID-19. RESULTS: Between March 12 and April 23, a total of 3,477 symptomatic employees were tested for COVID-19 at two employee testing centers; 185 (5.3%) employees tested positive for COVID-19. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was similar when comparing frontline HCWs (5.2%) to non-frontline staff (5.5%). Among 174 positive employees reached for follow-up at least 14 days after diagnosis, 6 reported COVID-related hospitalization; all recovered. CONCLUSIONS: During the study period, we observed that the prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests among symptomatic HCWs was comparable to that of symptomatic non-frontline staff. Reliable and rapid access to testing for employees is essential to preserve the health, safety, and availability of the healthcare workforce during this pandemic and to facilitate the rapid return of SARS-CoV-2 negative employees to work.","Mani, Nandita S; Budak, Jehan Z; Lan, Kristine F; Bryson-Cahn, Chloe; Zelikoff, Allison; Barker, Gwendolyn E C; Grant, Carolyn W; Hart, Kristi; Barbee, Carrie J; Sandoval, Marissa D; Dostal, Christine L; Corcorran, Maria; Ungerleider, Hal M; Gates, Jeff O; Olin, Svaya V; Bryan, Andrew; Hoffman, Noah G; Marquis, Sara R; Harvey, Michelle L; Nasenbeny, Keri; Mertens, Kathleen; Chew, Lisa D; Greninger, Alexander L; Jerome, Keith R; Pottinger, Paul S; Dellit, Timothy H; Liu, Catherine; Pergam, Steven A; Neme, Santiago; Lynch, John B; Kim, H Nina; Cohen, Seth A",Clin. infect. dis,100,11

The prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is also higher in regional and remote populations, and people with known CVD have increased morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition, COVID-19 is associated with serious cardiac manifestations, potentially placing additional demand on limited regional services at a time of diminished visiting metropolitan support with restricted travel. Inter-hospital transfer is currently challenging as receiving centres enact pandemic protocols, creating potential delays, and cardiovascular resources are diverted to increasing intensive care unit (ICU) and emergency department (ED) capacity. Regional and rural centres have limited staff resources, placing cardiac services at risk in the event of staff infection or quarantine during the pandemic. MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS: Health districts, cardiologists and government agencies need to minimise impacts on the already vulnerable cardiovascular health of regional and remote Australians and New Zealanders throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

Many of these changes have been serially modified in adaptation to growing service demands and department provision capacity. We evaluated the impact of the pandemic on the foot and ankle service at our trauma unit, assessing whether these adaptations to practice were justifiable, successful and sustainable for the future. This was a single-centre, retrospective cohort study analysing the patient care pathway from admission to discharge, for two pre-defined timeframes: Phase 0 (pre-lockdown phase) and Phase 1 (lockdown phase). Patients were split into stable and unstable injuries depending on their fracture pattern. The follow-up modality and duration were evaluated. Trauma throughput for the equivalent timeframe in 2019 was also analysed for comparison. There were 106 unstable fractures and 100 stable fractures in 2020.78 interventional procedures were performed on 72 patients with unstable fractures in Phase-1. Close contact casting was performed on 13 patients at presentation in the ED. Selective patients underwent partial fixation in theatre, which still provided adequate stability. 35% of patients with a stable fracture were discharged directly from the ED with written advice from a review letter. The treatment modality in selective patients, particularly the vulnerable should be carefully assessed. Interventions performed at presentation often negate the need for admission. Partial fixation reduces intraoperative time and surgical insult. Integrating telemedicine into the care pathway, particularly for stable ankle fractures reduces the need for physician-patient contact and eases follow-up burden. Many of our recommended changes are easily replicated in other clinical settings. Should these adaptations demonstrate long-term sustainability, it is likely they will remain incorporated into future clinical practice.","Shah, Rohi; Ahad, Abdul; Faizi, Murtuza; Mangwani, Jitendra",,100,33

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the association of metabolic risk factors and risk of Covid-19. METHODS: This study was designed according to PRISMA guidelines. Two independent researchers searched for the relevant studies using PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. The search terms developed focusing on two main roots of ""Covid-19"" and ""metabolic risk factors"". All relevant observational, analytical studies, review articles, and a meta-analysis on the adult population were included in this meta-analysis. Meta-analysis was performed using the random effect model for pooling proportions to address heterogeneity among studies. Data were analyzed using STATA package version 11.2, (StataCorp, USA). RESULTS: Through a comprehensive systematic search in the targeted databases we found 1124 papers, after running the proses of refining, 13 studies were included in the present meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of obesity in Covid-19 patients was 29% (95% CI: 14-47%). For Diabetes and Hypertension, these were 22% (95% CI: 12% 33%) and 32% (95% CI: 12% 56%), respectively. There was significant heterogeneity in the estimates of the three pooled prevalence without any significant small-study effects. Such warning points, to some extent, guide physicians and clinicians to better understand the importance of controlling co-morbid risk factors in prioritizing resource allocation and interventions. CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis showed that hypertension is more prevalent than obesity and diabetes in patients with Covid-19 disease. The prevalence of co-morbid metabolic risk factors must be adopted for better management and priority settings of public health vaccination and other required interventions. The results may help to improve services delivery in COVID-19 patients, while helping to develop better policies for prevention and response to COVID-19 and its critical outcomes.","Moazzami, Bahram; Chaichian, Shahla; Kasaeian, Amir; Djalalinia, Shirin; Akhlaghdoust, Meisam; Eslami, Masoud; Broumand, Behrooz",PLoS One,100,1

Initial reports from the outbreak in Italy, China and the USA have provided anecdotal evidence of improved outcomes with the administration of anti-IL-6 agents, and large-scale trials evaluating these therapies are ongoing. STUDY DESCRIPTION: In this retrospective case series, clinical outcomes and correlates of response to treatment with the IL-6 receptor antagonist sarilumab are described for 15 patients with COVID-19 from a single institution in Southern Italy. Among 10 patients whose symptoms improved after sarilumab treatment, rapid decreases in CRP levels corresponded with clinical improvement. Lower levels of IL-6 at baseline as well as lower neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio as compared with patients whose COVID-19 did not improve with treatment were associated with sarilumab-responsive disease. CONCLUSIONS: This observation may reflect a possible clinical benefit regarding early intervention with IL-6-modulatory therapies for COVID-19 and that CRP could be a potential biomarker of response to treatment.","Montesarchio, Vincenzo; Parrela, Roberto; Iommelli, Chiara; Bianco, Antonella; Manzillo, Elio; Fraganza, Fiorentino; Palumbo, Cristiana; Rea, Gaetano; Murino, Patrizia; De Rosa, Rosanna; Atripaldi, Luigi; D039,; Abbraccio, Maurizio; Curvietto, Marcello; Mallardo, Domenico; Celentano, Egidio; Grimaldi, Antonio Maria; Palla, Marco; Trojaniello, Claudia; Vitale, Maria Grazia; Million-Weaver, Samuel Lewis; Ascierto, Paolo Antonio",J. immunotherap. cancer,100,10

In the present work, we close a gap in the literature by computing the time delay during the proton tunneling. Our results, based on the well-known dwell time and our model of the entropic time, range from femtoseconds to picoseconds, and completely agree with the time scales of the structural changes in molecules (mutation processes not the complete replication processes). The tunneling delay times are thus nonnegligible and imply that the DNA mutations can be resolved using the attosecond laser technology, if not the femtosecond technology.

Respondents were recontacted after four months. Information sources included mainstream media, state health departments, the CDC, the White House, and a well-known university. We also examined how demographics, political partisanship, and skepticism about COVID-19 were associated with the perceived trustworthiness of information sources and decreased trustworthiness over time. At baseline, the majority of respondants reported high trust in COVID-19 information from state health departments (75.6%), the CDC (80.9%), and a university (Johns Hopkins, 81.1%). Mainstream media was trusted by less than half the respondents (41.2%), and the White House was the least trusted source (30.9%). At the 4-month follow-up, a significant decrease in trustworthiness in all five sources of COVID-19 information was observed. The most pronounced reductions were from the CDC and the White House. In multivariate analyses, factors associated with rating the CDC, state health department, and a university as trustworthy sources of COVID-19 information were political party affiliation, level of education, and skepticism about COVID-19. The most consistent predictor of decreased trust was political party affiliation, with Democrats as compared to Republicans less likely to report decreased trust across all sources.","Latkin, Carl A; Dayton, Lauren; Strickland, Justin C; Colon, Brian; Rimal, Rajiv; Boodram, Basmattee",J Health Commun,100,26

Several studies have indicated defects in the immune system of COVID-19 patients at different disease stages. Therefore, this study investigated whether alters in immune responses of COVID-19 patients may be considered as predicting factors for disease outcome. METHODS: The percentages of innate and adoptive immune cells in the recovered and dead patients with COVID-19, and healthy subjects were determined by flow cytometry. The levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and other immune factors were also measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: At the first day of hospitalization, the frequencies of CD56dim CD16+ NK cells and CD56bright CD16dim/- NK cells in patients who died during treatment were significantly increased compared to recovered and healthy individuals (P < 0.0001). The recovered and dead patients had a significant increase in monocyte number in comparison with healthy subjects (P < 0.05). No significant change was observed in Th1 cell numbers between the recovered and dead patients while Th2, Th17 cell, and Treg percentages in death cases were significantly lower than healthy control and those recovered, unlike exhausted CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and activated CD4 + T cells (P < 0.0001-0.05). The activated CD8 + T cell was significantly higher in the recovered patients than healthy individuals (P < 0.0001-0.05). IL-1&#945;, IL-1ß, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; levels in patients were significantly increased (P < 0.0001-0.01). However, there were no differences in TNF-&#945; and IL-1ß levels between dead and recovered patients. Unlike TGF-ß1 level, IL-10 was significantly increased in recovered patients (P < 0.05). Lymphocyte numbers in recovered patients were significantly increased compared to dead patients, unlike ESR value (P < 0.001-0.01). CRP value in recovered patients significantly differed from dead patients (P < 0.001).

The components of ICBT for tinnitus have, however, not been dismantled and thus the effectiveness of the different therapeutic components is unknown. It is, furthermore, not known if tinnitus subgroups with different clinical profiles respond differently to ICBT. Aims This dismantling study aimed to explore the contribution of applied relaxation within internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for reducing tinnitus distress and comorbidities associated with tinnitus. A secondary aim was to assess whether outcomes varied for three tinnitus subgroups, namely those with significant tinnitus severity, those with low tinnitus severity, and those with significant depression. Methods A parallel randomized controlled trial design (n = 126) was used to compare audiologist-guided applied relaxation with the full ICBT intervention. Recruitment was online and via the intervention platform. Assessments were completed at four-time points including a 2-month follow-up period. The primary outcome was tinnitus severity as measured by the Tinnitus Functional Index. Secondary outcomes were included for anxiety, depression, insomnia, negative tinnitus cognitions, health-related quality of life, hearing disability, and hyperacusis. Treatment engagement variables including the number of logins, number of modules opened, and the number of messages sent. Both an intention-to-treat analysis and completer's only analysis were undertaken. Results Engagement was low which compromised results as the full intervention was undertaken by few participants. Both the ICBT and applied relaxation resulted in large improvements of tinnitus severity (within-group effect sizes d = 0.87 and 0.68, respectively for completers only analysis), which were maintained, or further improved at follow-up. These reductions in tinnitus distress were greater for the ICBT group, with a small effect size differences (between-group d = 0.15 in favor of ICBT for completers only analysis). Tinnitus distress decreased the most at post-intervention for those with significant depression at baseline. Both ICBT and applied relaxation contributed to significant reductions on most secondary outcome measures, with no group differences, except for a greater reduction of hyperacusis in the ICBT group. Conclusion Due to poor compliance partly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic results were compromised. Further studies with stronger protocols are required. The intervention's effectiveness increased with initial level of tinnitus distress;those with the highest scores at intake experienced the most substantial changes on the outcome measures. This may suggest tailoring of interventions according to tinnitus severity. Larger samples are needed to confirm this.","Beukes, Eldré W.; Andersson, Gerhard Fagelson Marc A.; Manchaiah, Vinaya",Internet Interventions,100,22

Traditionally, physicians receive limited formal telemedicine training, making preparedness for this transition uneven. To describe challenges to and attitudes toward providing virtual patient care, we distributed a survey to physicians within our system who largely had no formal prior training/experience with telemedicine, but transitioned to routine telemedicine use. Data collected are then used to offer actionable recommendations for health system leaders and medical educators. Materials and Methods: Surveys were distributed to all faculty outpatient general internal medicine physicians working at any New York University Langone Health, New York City Health + Hospitals/Bellevue and Gouverneur, and the VA NY Harbor Health System (n = 378) in mid-2020. Survey items consisted of Likert and open-ended questions related to experience with televisits (13 items) and attitudes toward care (24 items). Results: Telehealth-related challenges varied by site and modality. Primary challenges included establishing a connection from the patient's (98%) or physician's end (84%) and difficulty in the following domains: working with team members (39%), physical examinations (95%), establishing new patient relationships (70%), and taking history (40%), among others. In thematic analysis, significant themes with illustrative qualitative commentary emerged related to technological challenges, new systems issues, and new patient/physician communication experiences. Discussion: Experience differences were rooted in the type of technology employed. Safety-net practices conducted mostly telephonic visits, whereas private outpatient sites utilized video, despite both using identical electronic medical records. As we consider a ""new normal"" and prolonged community transmission of COVID-19 infection, it is essential to establish telemedicine training, tools, and protocols that meet the needs of both patients and physicians.","Wilhite, Jeffrey A; Altshuler, Lisa; Fisher, Harriet; Gillespie, Colleen; Hanley, Kathleen; Goldberg, Eric; Wallach, Andrew; Zabar, Sondra",Telemed. j. e. health,100,16

Patients and methods: A vocal biomarker, a unitless scalar with a value between 0-1, was developed based on 434 voice samples. The biomarker training was followed by a prospective, multi-center, observational study. All subjects were tested for SARS-CoV-2, had their voice recorded to a smartphone application and gave their informed consent to participate in the study. The association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the vocal biomarker was evaluated. Results: Final study population included 80 subjects with a median age of 29 [23-36], of whom 68% were men. Forty patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Infected patients were 12 times more likely to report at least one symptom (odds ratio 11.8, p<.001). The vocal biomarker was significantly higher among infected patients (0.11 [0.06-0.17] vs. 0.19 [0.12-0.3], p=.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) evaluating the association of the vocal biomarker with SARS-CoV-2 status was 72%. With a biomarker threshold of 0.115, the results translated to a sensitivity and specificity of 85% [95% CI: 70-94%] and 53% [95% CI: 36-69%], respectively. When added to a self-reported symptom classifier, the AUC significantly improved from 0.775 to 0.85. Conclusion: Voice analysis is associated with SARS-CoV-2 status and holds the potential to improve the accuracy of self-reported symptom-based screening tools. This pilot study suggests a possible role for vocal biomarkers in screening for SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects.","Maor, Elad; Tsur, Nir; Barkai, Galia; Meister, Ido; Makmel, Shmuel; Friedman, Eli; Aronovich, Daniel; Mevorach, Dana; Lerman, Amir; Zimlichman, Eyal; Bachar, Gideon",,100,24

As of March 26, 2020, there are more than 500,000 cases and more than 25,000 deaths related to COVID-19, and the numbers are increasing by the hour. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the trends in confirmed COVID-19 cases in North Carolina, and to understand patterns in virtual visits related to symptoms of COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of confirmed COVID-19 cases and patients using an on-demand, statewide virtual urgent care center. We collected data from February 1, 2020, to March 15, 2020. Institutional Review Board exemption was obtained prior to the study. RESULTS: As of March, 18 2020, there were 92 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 733 total virtual visits. Of the total visits, 257 (35.1%) were related to COVID-19-like symptoms. Of the COVID-19-like visits, the number of females was 178 (69.2%). People in the age groups of 30-39 years (n=67, 26.1%) and 40-49 years (n=64, 24.9%) were half of the total patients. Additionally, approximately 96.9% (n=249) of the COVID-like encounters came from within the state of North Carolina. Our study shows that virtual care can provide efficient triaging in the counties with the highest number of COVID-19 cases. We also confirmed that the largest spread of the disease occurs in areas with a high population density as well as in areas with major airports. CONCLUSIONS: The use of virtual care presents promising potential in the fight against COVID-19. Virtual care is capable of reducing emergency room visits, conserving health care resources, and avoiding the spread of COVID-19 by treating patients remotely. We call for further adoption of virtual care by health systems across the United States and the world during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Khairat, Saif; Meng, Chenlu; Xu, Yuxuan; Edson, Barbara; Gianforcaro, Robert",JMIR Public Health Surveill,100,16

Platelets are important players in inflammation-induced thrombosis. In particular, procoagulant platelets support thrombin generation and mediate thromboinflammation. OBJECTIVES: To examine if procoagulant platelet formation is altered in COVID-19 patients and if procoagulant platelets contribute to pulmonary thrombosis. PATIENTS/METHODS: Healthy donors and COVID-19 patients were recruited from the University of Utah Hospital System. Platelets were isolated and procoagulant platelet formation measured by annexin V binding as well as mitochondrial function were examined. We utilized mice lacking the ability to form procoagulant platelets (CypDplt-/- ) to examine the role of procoagulant platelets in pulmonary thrombosis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We observed that platelets isolated from COVID-19 patients had a reduced ability to become procoagulant compared to those from matched healthy donors, as evidenced by reduced mitochondrial depolarization and phosphatidylserine exposure following dual stimulation with thrombin and convulxin. To understand what impact reduced procoagulant platelet responses might have in vivo, we subjected mice with a platelet-specific deletion of cyclophilin D, which are deficient in procoagulant platelet formation, to a model of pulmonary microvascular thrombosis. Mice with platelets lacking cyclophilin D died significantly faster from pulmonary microvascular thrombosis compared to littermate wild-type controls. These results suggest dysregulated procoagulant platelet responses may contribute to thrombotic complications during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Denorme, Frederik; Manne, Bhanu Kanth; Portier, Irina; Petrey, Aaron C; Middleton, Elizabeth A; Kile, Benjamin T; Rondina, Matthew T; Campbell, Robert A",J. thromb. haemost,100,1

Several methods are used commonly to measure polarization in social networks by purely inspecting their structure. We analyse eight of such methods and show that all of them yield high polarization scores even for random networks with similar density and degree distributions to typical real-world networks. Further, some of the methods are sensitive to degree distributions and relative sizes of the polarized groups. We propose normalization to the existing scores and a minimal set of tests that a score should pass in order for it to be suitable for separating polarized networks from random noise. The performance of the scores increased by 38%-220% after normalization in a classification task of 203 networks. Further, we find that the choice of method is not as important as normalization, after which most of the methods have better performance than the best-performing method before normalization. This work opens up the possibility to critically assess and compare the features and performance of structural polarization methods.","Salloum, Ali; Chen, Ted Hsuan Yun; Kivela, Mikko",,100,1

COVID-19 can provoke an acute inflammatory process and uncontrolled oxidative stress, which predisposes one to respiratory syndrome, and in the worst case, death. Recent evidence suggests the mechanistic role of mitochondria and vitamin D in the development of COVID-19. Indeed, mitochondrial dynamics contribute to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and its uncoupling involves pathological situations. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with altered mitochondrial dynamics with consequent oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory state, cytokine production, and cell death. Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency seems to be associated with increased COVID-19 risk. In contrast, vitamin D can normalize mitochondrial dynamics, which would improve oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory state, and cytokine production. Furthermore, vitamin D reduces renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation and, consequently, decreases ROS generation and improves the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, the purpose of this review is to deepen the knowledge about the role of mitochondria and vitamin D directly involved in the regulation of oxidative stress and the inflammatory state in SARS-CoV-2 infection. As future prospects, evidence suggests enhancing the vitamin D levels of the world population, especially of those individuals with additional risk factors that predispose to the lethal consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","de Las Heras, Natalia; Martín Giménez, Virna Margarita; Ferder, León; Manucha, Walter; Lahera, Vicente",,100,2

It has been recently suggested that SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS may differ from usual non-SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS by higher respiratory system compliance (CRS), lower potential for recruitment with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) contrasting with severe shunt fraction. The purpose of the study was to systematically assess respiratory mechanics and recruitability in SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS. Methods: Gas exchanges, CRSand hemodynamics were assessed at 2 levels of PEEP (15 cmH2O and 5 cmH2O) within 36 h (day1) and from 4 to 6 days (day 5) after intubation. The recruited volume was computed as the difference between the volume expired from PEEP 15 to 5 cmH2O and the volume predicted by compliance at PEEP 5 cmH2O (or above airway opening pressure). The recruitment-to-inflation (R/I) ratio (i.e. the ratio between the recruited lung compliance and CRSat PEEP 5 cmH2O) was used to assess lung recruitability. A R/I ratio value higher than or equal to 0.5 was used to define highly recruitable patients. Results: The R/I ratio was calculated in 25 of the 26 enrolled patients at day 1 and in 15 patients at day 5. At day 1, 16 (64%) were considered as highly recruitable (R/I ratio median [interquartile range] 0.7 [0.55–0.94]) and 9 (36%) were considered as poorly recruitable (R/I ratio 0.41 [0.31–0.48]). The PaO2/FiO2ratio at PEEP 15 cmH2O was higher compared to PEEP 5 cmH2O only in highly recruitable patients (173 [139–236] vs 135 [89–167] mmHg; p &lt; 0.01). Neither PaO2/FiO2or CRSmeasured at PEEP 15 cmH2O or at PEEP 5 cmH2O nor changes in PaO2/FiO2or CRSin response to PEEP changes allowed to identify highly or poorly recruitable patients. Conclusion: In this series of 25 patients with SARS-Cov-2 associated ARDS, 64% were considered as highly recruitable and only 36% as poorly recruitable based on the R/I ratio performed on the day of intubation. This observation suggests that a systematic R/I ratio assessment may help to guide initial PEEP titration to limit harmful effect of unnecessary high PEEP in the context of Covid-19 crisis.","Beloncle, François M.; Pavlovsky, Bertrand; Desprez, Christophe; Fage, Nicolas; Olivier, Pierre-Yves; Asfar, Pierre; Richard, Jean-Christophe; Mercat, Alain",Ann.

DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of open-ended prompts included as part of an anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey of pregnant women in the United States. SETTING: Online survey with participants from 47 states within the U.S. PARTICIPANTS: Self-identified pregnant women recruited through Facebook, Twitter, and other online sources. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: An anonymous, online survey of pregnant women (distributed April 3 - 24, 2020) included an open-ended prompt asking women to tell us how COVID-19 had affected their prenatal care. Open-ended narrative responses were downloaded into Excel and coded using the Attride-Sterling Framework. 2519 pregnant women from 47 states responded to the survey, 88.4% of whom had at least one previous birth. Mean age was 32.7 years, mean weeks pregnant was 24.3 weeks, and mean number of prenatal visits at the point of the survey was 6.5. Predominant themes of the open narratives included COVID-19's role in creating structural changes within the healthcare system (reported spontaneously by 2075 respondents), behavioral changes among both pregnant women and their providers (reported by 429 respondents), and emotional consequences for women who were pregnant (reported by 503 respondents) during the pandemic. Changes resulting from COVID-19 varied widely by provider, and women's perceptions of the impact on quality of care ranged from perceiving care as extremely compromised to perceiving it to be improved as a result of the pandemic. KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Women who are pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic have faced enormous upheaval as hospitals and healthcare providers have struggled to meet the simultaneous and often competing demands of infection prevention, pandemic preparedness, high patient volumes of extremely sick patients, and the needs of 'non-urgent' pregnant patients. In some settings, women described very few changes, whereas others reported radical changes implemented seemingly overnight. While infection rates may drive variable responses, these inconsistencies raise important questions regarding the need for local, state, national, or even global recommendations for the care of pregnant women during a global pandemic such as COVID-19.","Javaid, Sarah; Barringer, Sarah; Compton, Sarah D; Kaselitz, Elizabeth; Muzik, Maria; Moyer, Cheryl A",Midwifery,100,16

Furthermore, those amounts exceeded their respective shale values. The pollution evaluation indices indicated a moderate level of contamination by Cs, Pb, Th, Ag, Hf, Ta, W, and lanthanides but excluding lanthanum (La) and lutetium (Lu). The pollution load index revealed pollution at two brickfields. Multivariate statistics reported that coal combustion in the brick kilns is the primary source of lanthanides, actinides, Y, Zr, and Hf in the soil, while other elements derived mostly from natural sources. A portion originated from coal combustion in brick kilns and agricultural activities. Changes in metal (oid)s concentrations were non-linear with the distance between the kilns and sampling points. Consequently, further studies are required and should consider meteorological factors and severity of human impact in the study area.","Kumar, Sazal; Zhao, Meixia; Zhang, Haiyang; Rahman, Md Aminur; Luo, Chuanxiu; Rahman, Mohammad Mahmudur",Chemosphere,100,29

Photonics offers an alternate route to simulating such nonclassical behavior in a more robust platform. However, in photonic implementations to date, an increase to the depth of a continuous quantum walk requires modifying the footprint of the system. Here we report continuous walks of a two-photon quantum frequency comb with entanglement across multiple dimensions. The coupling between frequency modes is mediated by electro-optic phase modulation, which makes the evolution of the state completely tunable over a continuous range. With arbitrary control of the phase across different modes, we demonstrate a rich variety of behavior: from walks exhibiting ballistic transport or strong energy confinement, to subspaces featuring bosonic or fermionic character. We also explore the role of entanglement dimensionality and demonstrate biphoton energy bound states, which are only possible with multilevel entanglement. This suggests the potential for such walks to quantify entanglement in high-dimensional systems.","Imany, Poolad; Lingaraju, Navin B.; Alshaykh, Mohammed S.; Leaird, Daniel E.; Weiner, Andrew M.",,100,16

METHODS: Data of 45,161 Brazilian adults from a nationwide behavior survey, conducted between April 24th and May 24th (2020), were used. Participants reported physical inactivity (PI; <150 min/week), high TV-viewing (TV; &#8805;4 h/day), and high computer/tablet use (PC; &#8805;4 h/day) before and during COVID-19 quarantine (exposures). For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without the risk behavior before quarantine. Changes in sleep quality during the quarantine period (maintained/got better or worsened) were treated as a mediator. Elevated frequencies of feelings of loneliness, sadness (feel sad, crestfallen, or depressed), and anxiety (feel worried, anxious, or nervous) during the pandemic period were the study outcomes. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during quarantine, skin color, previous diagnosis of depression, and adherence to quarantine. Mediation models were created using the Karlson Holm Breen method. RESULTS: The incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use were associated with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety feelings. Worsening sleep quality partly mediated the association of the incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use with loneliness (PI:30.9%; TV:19.6%; PC: 30.5%), sadness (PI:29.8%; TV:29.3%; PC: 39.1%), and anxiety (PI:21.9%; TV:30.0%; PC:38.5%). CONCLUSION: The association of the incidence of physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors with mental health indicators is partly mediated by worsening sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine.","Werneck, André O; Silva, Danilo R; Malta, Deborah Carvalho; Lima, Margareth G; Souza-Júnior, Paulo R B; Azevedo, Luiz O; Barros, Marilisa B A; Szwarcwald, Célia L",Sleep Med,100,26

We show by off-axis electron holography that the piezoelectric potential and information about the indium concentration from the mean inner potential are obtained simultaneously. By separating the components using a model, we show that for higher concentrations of indium in the quantum wells grown on InGaNOS substrates, the piezoelectric potentials are reduced. The measurements of the indium concentrations by electron holography have been verified by combining energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, X-ray diffraction and from the tensile deformation made by precession electron diffraction.

Lung tissue examination has been largely derived from autopsy - a combination of case reports, small and moderately sized series with international scope. Common and uncommon histopathology provides insight into the progression of severe, fatal disease. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 lung histology is most commonly diffuse alveolar damage as part of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Lung injury can be temporally heterogeneous, with patterns of healing alongside new injury. Viral studies, including immunohistochemistry, RNA in-situ hybridization, and tissue-based Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assist in discerning complications of therapy (e.g. ventilator-associated pneumonia) from primary viral-induced injury. Response to viral infection produces systemic effects, and one major manifestation is thrombosis of micro-circulation and larger vessels. Less common patterns include neutrophil-rich inflammation, raising speculation that neutrophil extra-cellular traps may play a role in both viral control and exaggerated immune response. SUMMARY: The heterogeneity of fatal cases- persistence of viral infection in lung, clearance of virus but severe lung injury, thrombosis, and exaggerated immune response - suggest that antiviral, antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and supportive therapy play a role in treatment, but that the patient-specific cause and timing of the lung injury is important in choosing intervention.","Borczuk, Alain C",Curr. opin. pulm. med,100,23

Here we utilized a combination of targeted amino acids (AAs) and clinical biochemical profiling to analyze the plasma of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) subjects at the hospitalization stage and 1-month post-infection convalescent stage, respectively, to investigate the systematic injury during COVID-19 disease progress. We found the virus-induced inflammatory status and reduced liver synthesis capacity in hospitalized patients, which manifested with increased branched-chain AAs (BCAAs), aromatic AAs (AAAs), one-carbon related metabolites, and decreased methionine. Most of these disturbances during infection recover except for the increased levels of medium-chain acylcarnitines (ACs) in the convalescent subjects, implying the existence of incomplete fatty acids oxidation during recovery periods. Our results suggested that the imbalance of the AA profiling in COVID-19 patients. The majority of disturbed AAs recovered in 1 month.

The aim of this systematic review was to appraise the quality and availability of guidelines, and whether non-invasive ventilation in the early stages of the pandemic is of importance. DESIGN AND METHOD: Databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, as well as websites of international organizations and gray literature, were searched up to June 23, 2020. The reference lists of eligible papers were also hand-searched. RESULTS: A total of 26 guidelines met the inclusion criteria. According to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument, the guidelines' methodological quality was low. Among six domains, Rigour of Development and Editorial Independence were of the lowest quality. Given the lack of evidence from randomized clinical trials and the great variation between different regions, recommendations for non-invasive ventilation have generated considerable debate regarding the early stages of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Improving the methodological quality of the guidelines should be a goal with regard to future pandemics.

Autogenic training is a well-known method in Europe for the treatment of anxiety and stress disorders. The practice of autogenic training is also reported to improve neurovegetative and immune regulation. This study focuses on describing how autogenic training is helping its practitioners to cope with the pandemic. Specifically, they report strong beneficial effects on their physical, psychological, and relational health. In total, 75 autogenic training practitioners (41 women), age 22–71, participated in the survey. An ad-hoc questionnaire was developed to collect information on sociodemographic variables, health status during the pandemic, characteristics of their AT practice, and response to the pandemic as outcome variables. The questionnaire was distributed through Google Forms in the first week of September 2020. The results show that there was an increase in the practice of autogenic therapy during the pandemic, especially among women. In addition, the majority of participants (88%) remained healthy during the pandemic. Furthermore, the results show that autogenic training is very useful for physical and psychological health and for a better understanding of others. Therefore, the practice of autogenic training is recommended to people who live moments of anxiety, are afraid of illness, or feel that they have to improve the quality of relationships with others.","de Rivera, Luis; Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Naiara; Dosil-Santamaría, María; de Rivera-Monterrey, Leonor",Front Psychol,100,17

The mRNA technology was used to manufacture the Pfizer vaccine; however, as a pioneering technology that has never been used in the manufacture of vaccines, many people have concerns about the vaccine’s side effects. Thus, the current study aimed to track the short-term side effects of the vaccine. METHODS: The information in this study was gathered by a Google Form-questionnaire (online survey). The results included the responses of 455 individuals, all of whom are Saudi Arabia inhabitants. Adverse effects of the vaccine were reported after the first and the second doses. RESULTS: The most common symptoms were injection site pain, headaches, flu-like symptoms, fever, and tiredness. Less common side effects were a fast heartbeat, whole body aches, difficulty breathing, joint pain, chills, and drowsiness. Rare side effects include Bell’s palsy and lymph nodes swelling and tenderness. Flu-like symptoms were more common among those under 60 years of age, while injection site pain was more frequent among recipients who were 60 years and older. The study revealed a significant increase in the number of females who suffered from the vaccine side effects compared to males. Difficulty of breathing was more reported among recipients who had been previously infected with the coronavirus compared to those who had not been previously infected. CONCLUSION: Most of the side effects reported in this study were consistent with Pfizer’s fact sheet for recipients and caregivers.

STUDY DESIGN: An observational retrospective design was used to investigate avoided visits and hospitalizations of an departmental emergency department combined with a clustering approach on multimorbidity patterns. METHODS: A multimorbidity clustering technique was applied on the emergency department diagnostics to segment the population in diseases clusters. Global visits and hospitalizations from an emergency department during the 2020 lockdown were put in perspective with the same period during 2019. Using a comparison with the five previous years, avoided hospitalizations per inhabitants during the lockdown were estimated for each diseases cluster. RESULTS: During the 8 weeks of lockdown, the number of emergency department visits have been reduced by 41.47% and resultant hospitalizations by 28.50% compared to 2019. The retrospective study showed that 14 of 17 diseases clusters had a statistically significant reduction in hospitalizations with a pronounced effect on lower acuity diagnoses and middle-aged patient, leading to 293 avoided hospitalizations per 100,000 inhabitants compared to the 5 previous years and to the 85.8 COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100,000 inhabitants. CONCLUSION: Although specific to a regional context of pandemic containment, the study suggest that COVID-19 lockdown had beneficial effects on the crowding situation of the emergency departments and hospitals with avoidance effects primarily link to reduced risks.","Wartelle, Adrien; Mourad-Chehade, Farah; Yalaoui, Farouk; Chrusciel, Jan; Laplanche, David; Sanchez, Stéphane",Public Health Pract (Oxf),100,1

Lung ultrasound (LUS) use has been proposed to identify suspected COVID-19 patients and direct them to the isolation area in the emergency department (ED) or to discharge them for outpatient treatment. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to retrospectively investigate the use of LUS in the ED to identify COVID-19 pneumonia (CP). METHODS: We performed a retrospective single-center study including all patients accessing the ED who underwent LUS examination for suspicion of COVID-19 during the initial outbreak. Demographics, clinical parameters, laboratory values, imaging features, and outcome variables were collected. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 41% patients were COVID-19-positive; 67% of them were diagnosed with CP. The ROC curve of the LUS score showed an area under the curve of 0.837 (95% CI 0.75–0.92) and with a cutoff value ≥3 identified 28 of 31 patients with CP and 11 of 15 without (sensitivity 90%, 95% CI 74–97% specificity 75%, 95% CI 56–76%). LUS in combination with nasopharyngeal swab has a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 74–97%) and a specificity of 61% (95% CI 44–67%). CONCLUSIONS: LUS is a promising technique for early identification of CP in patients who accessed the ED in an active epidemic time. The LUS score shows a sensitivity of 90% for CP, allowing to quickly direct patients with COVID-19 to the ED isolation area or to discharge them for outpatient treatment.","Zanforlin, Alessandro; Strapazzon, Giacomo; Falk, Markus; Gallina, Valentina; Viteritti, Antonio; Valzolgher, Laura; La Guardia, Mario; Ferro, Federica; Pagani, Leonardo; Vezzali, Norberto",Respiration,100,20

Emerging evidence suggests that there might be an association between COVID‐19 and GBS. Nevertheless, the underlying pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed bioinformatic analyses to delineate the potential genetic crosstalk between COVID‐19 and GBS. RESULTS: COVID‐19 and GBS were associated with a similar subset of immune/inflammation regulatory genes, including TNF, CSF2, IL2RA, IL1B, IL4, IL6 and IL10. Protein‐protein interaction network analysis revealed that the combined gene set showed an increased connectivity as compared to COVID‐19 or GBS alone, particularly the potentiated interactions with CD86, IL23A, IL27, ISG20, PTGS2, HLA‐DRB1, HLA‐DQB1 and ITGAM, and these genes are related to Th17 cell differentiation. Transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with COVID‐19 and GBS further demonstrated the activation of interleukin‐17 signalling in both conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Augmented Th17 cell differentiation and cytokine response was identified in both COVID‐19 and GBS. PBMC transcriptome analysis also suggested the pivotal involvement of Th17 signalling pathway. In conclusion, our data suggested aberrant Th17 cell differentiation as a possible mechanism by which COVID‐19 can increase the risk of GBS.","Li, Zheng; Huang, Ziheng; Li, Xingye; Huang, Cheng; Shen, Jianxiong; Li, Shugang; Zhang, Lin; Wong, Sunny H.; Chan, Matthew T.

The base case was a 65-year-old male smoker with COPD presenting for surgical biopsy of 1.5-2.0 cm lung nodule highly suspicious for cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared immediate surgical resection to delayed resection after three months. The likelihood of key outcomes was derived from the literature where available. The outcome was 5-year overall survival. Results Immediate surgical resection resulted in a similar but slightly higher 5-year overall survival when compared to delayed resection (0.77 versus 0.74), due to the risk of disease progression. However, if the probability of acquired COVID-19 infection is greater than 13%, delayed resection is favorable (0.74 vs 0.73). Conclusions Immediate surgical biopsy of lung nodules suspicious for cancer in hospitals with low COVID-19 prevalence likely results in improved 5-year survival. However, as the risk of perioperative COVID-19 infection increases above 13%, a delayed approach has similar or improved survival. This balance should be frequently re-examined at each healthcare facility throughout the curve of the pandemic.","Shipe, Maren E.; Haddad, Diane N.; Deppen, Stephen A.; Kozower, Benjamin D.; Grogan, Eric L.",Ann Thorac Surg,100,16

For this reason, we implemented new forms of care. Mainly electronic consultation (eConsult) using institutional email as way of contact between Primary Care Providers (PCPs) and nephrologist, trying to decrease in-person visit. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the results of the creation in June 2020 of a Nephrology electronic consultation in our hospital. METHOD: Retrospective observational study of eConsults made to our department, which serves a population of 200.000 people, with total of 9 primary care centers. The study period was June 10, 2020 to December 31, 2020. We have studied the number of eConsults, response time, type of consult made, problem resolution and subsequent follow up. RESULTS: Of 141 workdays, in 61 days (43%) there was eConsult, total 80 eConsults, mean 1.3 and median 1 daily (range 1 to 3). All primary care centers used this communication way, as well as 50 PCPs. Median response time for eConsult was 1 day (range 1-4). 55% patient was male, mean age 70.8 years (SD 13.9) (range 16-95 years). 64% it was his first assessment for Nephrology. The most frequent causes of eConsult: increase of creatinine (41.3%), uncontrolled blood pressure (12.5%), sodium and potassium disturbances (11.3%), treatment adjustment (11.3%) and changes in previous appointment (8.8%). After assessment eConsult, to 55% of patients was treatment adjustment, 22.5% were converted to an in-person visit, 11% they didn´t need any action but only 1 patient was referred to the emergency room. 44% patient is subsequent follow up by PCPs, 39% by nephrologist, 15% joint assessment PCP and nephrologist and 2% by other specialists. Only 2 patients (2.5%) made second eConsult. CONCLUSION: The eConsult is an important help to PCPs to solve doubts quickly, avoid unnecessary the travels to hospital the patients, treatment adjustment above all in control of hypertension an ionic disturbance, and guide in handling of chronic kidney disease. The diffusion and empowerment of this type of consultation in a next future may decrease, partly, the usual saturation of face-to-face visit and optimize the patient population being seen by nephrologist.","Herrero Berron, Juan Carlos; Lentisco, Carolina; Oliet, Aniana; Suso, Andrea; Onate Alonso, Irene; Sanchez, Maria; Camacho, Rosa; Mon, Carmen; Ortiz, Milagros; Ortega, Olimpia",Nephrol Dial Transplant,100,1

However, they may cause a wide range of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). While most irAEs are manageable with temporary cessation of ICI and immunosuppression, cardiovascular toxicity can be associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. As ICIs evolve to include high-risk patients with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors and disease, the risk and relevance of ICI-associated cardiotoxicity may be even higher. RECENT FINDINGS: Several cardiovascular toxicities such as myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, and pericardial disease have been reported in association with ICIs. Recent findings also suggest an increased risk of atherosclerosis with ICI use. ICI-associated myocarditis usually occurs early after initiation and can be fulminant. A high index of suspicion is required for timely diagnosis. Prompt treatment with high-dose corticosteroids is shown to improve outcomes. SUMMARY: Although the overall incidence is rare, ICI cardiotoxicity, particularly myocarditis, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, making it a major therapy-limiting adverse event. Early recognition and prompt treatment with the cessation of ICI therapy and initiation of high-dose corticosteroids are crucial to improve outcomes. Cardio-oncologists will need to play an important role not just in the management of acute cardiotoxicity but also to reduce the risk of long-term sequelae.","Patel, Rushin P.; Parikh, Rohan; Gunturu, Krishna S.; Tariq, Rana Zouveenoor; Dani, Sourbha S.; Ganatra, Sarju; Nohria, Anju",Curr Oncol Rep,100,16

This study seeks to characterize Emergency Department (ED) discharges suspected of Covid-19 that are admitted within 72 h. METHODS: We abstracted all adult discharges with suspected Covid-19 from five New York City EDs between March 2nd and April 15th. Those admitted within 72 h were then compared against those who were not using descriptive and regression analysis of background and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Discharged ED patients returning within 72 h were more often admitted if suspected of Covid-19 (32.9% vs 12.1%, p < .0001). Of 7433 suspected Covid-19 discharges, the 139 (1.9%) admitted within 72 h were older (55.4 vs. 45.6 years, OR 1.03) and more often male (1.32) or with a history of obstructive lung disease (2.77) or diabetes (1.58) than those who were not admitted (p < .05). Additional associations included non-English preference, cancer, heart failure, hypertension, renal disease, ambulance arrival, higher triage acuity, longer ED stay or time from symptom onset, fever, tachycardia, dyspnea, gastrointestinal symptoms, x-ray abnormalities, and decreased platelets and lymphocytes (p < .05 for all). On 72-h return, 91 (65.5%) subjects required oxygen, and 7 (5.0%) required mechanical ventilation in the ED. Twenty-two (15.8%) of the study group have since died. CONCLUSION: Several factors emerge as associated with 72-h ED return admission in subjects suspected of Covid-19. These should be considered when assessing discharge risk in clinical practice.","Margus, Colton; Sondheim, Samuel E.; Peck, Nathan M.; Storch, Bess; Ngai, Ka Ming; Ho, Hsi En; She, Trent",Am J Emerg Med,100,20

Bioinformatics represent an outstanding approach to reveal key immunogenic regions in viral proteins. Here, five non-structural proteins (NSP) of SARS-CoV-2 (NSP7, NSP8, NSP9, NSP12, and NSP13) were screening for potential human leukocyte antigen (HLA) binding peptides. These peptides showed robust viral antigenicity, immunogenicity, and a marked interaction with HLA alleles. Interestingly, several peptides showed affinity by HLA class I (HLA-I) alleles that commonly activates to NK cells. Moreover, HLA-I and HLA class II (HLA-II) binding peptides induced humoral and cell-mediated responses after in silico vaccination. Notably, these peptides are conserved among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Enhanced TCB is an expansion of the traditional TCB that proved highly effective during Taiwan’s 2003 SARS outbreak. TCB’s success derived from ensuring that Health Care Workers (HCWs) and patients were protected from fomite, contact and droplet transmission within hospitals. Although TCB proved successful during SARS, achieving a similar level of success with the COVID-19 outbreak requires adapting TCB to the unique manifestations of this new disease. These manifestations include asymptomatic infection, a hyper-affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility, false negatives, and an incubation period of up to 22 days. Enhanced TCB incorporates the necessary adaptations. In particular, eTCB includes expanding the TCB transition zone to incorporate a new sector – the quarantine ward. This ward houses patients exhibiting atypical manifestations or awaiting definitive diagnosis. A second adaptation involves enhancing the checkpoint hand disinfection and gowning up with Personal Protective Equipment deployed in traditional TCB. Under eTCB, checkpoint hand disinfection and donning of face masks are now required of all visitors who seek to enter hospitals. These enhancements ensure that transmissions by droplets, fomites and contact are disrupted both within hospitals and between hospitals and the broader community. Evidencing eTCB effectiveness is Taiwan’s success to date in containing and controlling the community-hospital-community transmission cycle.","Yen, Muh-Yong; Schwartz, Jonathan; Chen, Shey-Ying; King, Chwan-Chuen; Yang, Guang-Yang; Hsueh, Po-Ren",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,100,20

We aimed to study the epidemiology, clinical features and short-term outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. METHODS: We performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital, including 55 severe patients and 166 non-severe patients, from January 2, 2020 to February 10, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 221 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea. On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia. In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate agreement among TTW and NS, NPS, or BAL for identification of viral and bacterial pathogens in dairy calves with BRD. ANIMALS: One hundred dairy calves with naturally acquired BRD. METHODS: Calves were sampled by all 4 methods. Viral agents were identified by real‐time RT‐PCR, bacteria were identified by aerobic culture, and Mycoplasma bovis (M. bovis) isolates were speciated by PCR. Agreement among TTW and NS, NPS, or BAL was evaluated by calculating the kappa statistic and percent positive agreement. McNemar's exact test was used to compare the proportions of positive results. RESULTS: Agreement among TTW and NS, TTW and NPS, and TTW and BAL, was very good for identification of P. multocida, M. haemolytica, and M. bovis.

We present a stealth labeling approach that can efficiently, and with high fidelity, generate RNA transcripts, through enzymatic incorporation of the triphosphate of tC(O), a fluorescent tricyclic cytosine analogue. We demonstrate this by incorporation of tC(O) in up to 100% of the natural cytosine positions of a 1.2 kb mRNA encoding for the histone H2B fused to GFP (H2B:GFP). Spectroscopic characterization of this mRNA shows that the incorporation rate of tC(O) is similar to cytosine, which allows for efficient labeling and controlled tuning of labeling ratios for different applications. Using live cell confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we show that the tC(O)-labeled mRNA is efficiently translated into H2B:GFP inside human cells. Hence, we not only develop the use of fluorescent base analogue labeling of nucleic acids in live-cell microscopy but also, importantly, show that the resulting transcript is translated into the correct protein. Moreover, the spectral properties of our transcripts and their translation product allow for their straightforward, simultaneous visualization in live cells. Finally, we find that chemically transfected tC(O)-labeled RNA, unlike a state-of-the-art fluorescently labeled RNA, gives rise to expression of a similar amount of protein as its natural counterpart, hence representing a methodology for studying natural, unperturbed processing of mRNA used in RNA therapeutics and in vaccines, like the ones developed against SARS-CoV-2.","Baladi, Tom; Nilsson, Jesper R.; Gallud, Audrey; Celauro, Emanuele; Gasse, Cécile; Levi-Acobas, Fabienne; Sarac, Ivo; Hollenstein, Marcel R.; Dahlén, Anders; Esbjörner, Elin K.; Wilhelmsson, L.

Not controlling such disasters brings about severe disruptions in the supply chains and communities and, thereby, irreparable losses will come into play. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of these disasters that has caused severe disruptions across the world and in many supply chains, particularly in the healthcare supply chain. Therefore, this paper, for the first time, develops a practical decision support system based on physicians' knowledge and fuzzy inference system (FIS) in order to help with the demand management in the healthcare supply chain, to reduce stress in the community, to break down the COVID-19 propagation chain, and, generally, to mitigate the epidemic outbreaks for healthcare supply chain disruptions. This approach first divides community residents into four groups based on the risk level of their immune system (namely, very sensitive, sensitive, slightly sensitive, and normal) and by two indicators of age and pre-existing diseases (such as diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure). Then, these individuals are classified and are required to observe the regulations of their class. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed approach was measured in the real world using the information from four users and the results showed the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.","Govindan, Kannan; Mina, Hassan; Alavi, Behrouz",Transp Res E Logist Transp Rev,100,16

METHODS: One hundred and sixty-four first-year college students answered twice-weekly questionnaires assessing stress exposure and perception, sleep duration, and sleep quality from January until May, 2020 (N=4,269 unique observations). RESULTS: Multilevel growth modeling revealed that prior to distance learning, student stress was increasing and sleep duration and quality were decreasing. After transitioning online, students’ stress exposure and perception trajectories immediately and continuously decreased; sleep quality initially increased but decreased over time; and sleep duration increased but then plateaued for the remainder of the semester. Days with higher stress exposure than typical for that student were associated with lower sleep quality, and both higher stress exposure and perception at the transition were linked with simultaneous lower sleep quality. Specific groups (e.g., females) were identified as at-risk for stress and sleep problems. CONCLUSION: Although transitioning to remote learning initially alleviated college students’ stress and improved sleep, these effects plateaued, and greater exposure to academic, financial, and interpersonal stressors predicted worse sleep quality on both daily and average levels. Environmental stressors may particularly dictate sleep quality during times of transition, but adaptations in learning modalities may help mitigate short-term detrimental health outcomes during global emergencies, even during a developmental period with considerable stress vulnerability. Future studies should examine longer-term implications of these trajectories on mental and physical health.","Gusman, Michaela S; Grimm, Kevin J; Cohen, Adam B; Doane, Leah D",Sleep,100,0

With the rapid community spread and the possibility of another wave of COVID-19 infections in the fall, receiving an influenza vaccine is of particular importance to mitigate the risk associated with overlapping influenza and COVID-19 infections. METHODS: We utilized cross-sectional data from the 2016 to 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a nationally representative U.S. telephone-based survey of adults 18 years or older. Race/ethnicity was our exposure of interest. We assessed the relative difference in influenza vaccination by race/ethnicity for each U.S. state in the overall U.S. population and among those with ASCVD as prevalence of receipt of influenza vaccination among Blacks or Hispanics minus prevalence among Whites divided by prevalence among Whites. We used multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models to evaluate the association between socioeconomic risk factors and receipt of influenza vaccination. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 1,747,397 participants of whom 21% were older than 65 years, 51% women, 63% White, 12% Black, 17% Hispanic, and 9% with history of ASCVD. The receipt of influenza vaccine was 38% in the overall population and 51% among those with self-reported ASCVD, which translates to approximately to 97 million and 12 million US adults, respectively. The receipt of influenza vaccine among individuals with ASCVD was 54% for Whites, 45% for Blacks, and 42% for Hispanics (p<0.001). In the overall U.S. population, the median (interquartile range) relative difference for influenza vaccination between Blacks and Whites was 17% (-27%, -9%) and –22% (-29%, -9%) between Hispanics and Whites across all U.S. states. Among individuals with and without ASCVD, Age older than 65 years, greater than college education, higher income, and having a PCP were significantly associated with higher odds of receipt of influenza vaccination, while being employed, lack of healthcare coverage, Black race, and delay in healthcare access were significantly inversely associated with having received an influenza vaccine CONCLUSIONS: Only 50% patients with ASCVD receive influenza vaccines. The receipt of influenza vaccination among individuals with ASCVD is lower among Blacks and Hispanics compared to Whites with significant state-level variation. There are important socioeconomic determinants that are associated with receipt of influenza vaccine.","Rifai, Mahmoud Al; Khalid, Umair; Misra, Arunima; Liu, Jing; Nasir, Khurram; Cainzos-Achirica, Miguel; Mahtta, Dhruv; Ballantyne, Christie M.; Petersen, Laura A.; Virani, Salim S.",Am J Prev Cardiol,100,16

Here, we investigated asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection development and progression in subjects undergoing mandatory quarantine on airport arrival. METHODS: 2714 subjects were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and all were quarantined for 2 weeks. Viral retesting was undertaken on symptom development and routinely at 14 days if asymptomatic. Asymptomatic positive patients underwent viral testing every 2 days to determine viral clearance. RESULTS: 188/2714(6.9%) patients became SARS-CoV-2 positive. On arrival, 44/188(23.4%) testing positive were symptomatic and 92/188(48.9%) were asymptomatic (136/188 positive on arrival); all 92 patients remained asymptomatic and were retested every 2-days until viral clearance. 2526 quarantined subjects remained virus free at 14-days. Viral clearance did not differ between these symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (12.6 ± 1.0days and 12.1 ± 0.4days, respectively). Of the 52/188(27.7%) testing negative on arrival, 27/52 became positive and developed symptoms from day 2 to day 13 following arrival. 25/188(13.3%) subjects remained asymptomatic and tested positive at day 14; viral testing was undertaken every 2 days in these subjects, 24/188(12.8%) remained asymptomatic with viral clearance (9.4 ± 0.7days) less than those asymptomatic on arrival(p < 0.002).

OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the risk of infection for patients with solid tumors undergoing ICI therapy based on a systematic review and meta-analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Pubmed databases were searched up to 1 December 2020. Randomized trials comparing any ICI alone, with chemotherapy (CT), or with other agents versus placebo, CT, or other agents were included. Three independent reviewers extracted the data. The primary outcome was the RR of all-grade (G) and G3–5 infections for patients receiving ICI-based treatments. Random or fixed-effect models were used according to statistical heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 21,451 patients from N = 36 studies were eligible. ICIs were associated with a similar risk of all-grade infections (RR = 1.02; 95% CI 0.84–1.24; P = 0.85) versus non-ICI treatments (G1–5 events: 9.6 versus 8.3%). When the ICIs alone were compared to CT, their use was associated with 42% less risk of all-grade infections (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.4–0.85; P = 0.01). Compared to CT, the combination of ICIs and CT increased the risk of all-grade (RR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.23–1.53; P < 0.01) and severe infections (RR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.17–1.96; P < 0.01). In anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-CTLA-4, monotherapy, and combination trials, the RR of all-grade infections was 0.72 (95% CI 0.49–1.05; P = 0.09), 1.18 (95% CI 0.95–1.46; P = 0.13), 1.74 (95% CI 1.13–2.67; P = 0.01), 0.97 (95% CI 0.79–1.19; P = 0.75) and 2.26 (95% CI 1.34–3.8; P < 0.01), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to CT alone, ICIs were safer and are recommended for frail patients. Conversely, CT + ICIs or ICIs combinations increased infection risk. Further studies are required to identify high-risk patients and evaluate the need for CT dose reduction or prophylactic myeloid growth factors.

METHODS This retrospective cohort study included 43,267 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Veterans Health Administration between 03/01/20 and 08/31/20 and followed until 09/30/20. We focused our analysis on patients that were subsequently hospitalized, and categorized them into groups based on the month of hospitalization. We summarized our findings through descriptive statistics. We used a nonparametric rank-sum test for trend to examine any differences in the distribution of our study variables across the six months. RESULTS During our study period, 8,240 patients were hospitalized, and 1,081 (13.1%) died within 30 days of admission. Hospitalizations increased over time, but the proportion of patients that died consistently declined from March (N=221/890, 24.8%) to August (N=111/1,396, 8.0%). Patients hospitalized in March compared to August were younger on average, mostly black, and symptomatic. They also had a higher frequency of baseline comorbidities, including hypertension and diabetes, and were more likely to present with abnormal laboratory findings including low lymphocyte counts and elevated creatinine. Lastly, receipt of mechanical ventilation and Hydroxychloroquine declined from March to August, while treatment with Dexamethasone and Remdesivir increased.

An arginine-rich motif of P7a N-terminus was found to determine nuclear and nucleolar localization. Amino acids substitution or deletion of the R-rich motif interfered with P7a nuclear and nucleolar localization. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays revealed that P7a protein interacted with Nicotiana benthamiana nuclear import factor importin α, suggesting that P7a is translocated into the nucleus by the classical importin α/β-dependent pathway. Moreover, P7a also interacted with the nucleolar protein fibrillarin. Mutations in the R-rich motif of P7a diminished P7a interactions with importin α and fibrillarin, influenced viral replication in Nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts and altered the symptom phenotype and viral RNA accumulation in Chenopodium amaranticolor plants. These results demonstrate that the R-rich motif of P7a is correlated with nuclear and nucleolar localization, viral replication and virus infection.","Wang, Xiaohui; Zhang, Yanjing; Xu, Jin; Shi, Lindan; Fan, Huiyan; Han, Chenggui; Li, Dawei; Yu, Jialin",Virus Research,100,20

The timely availability of thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes has enabled the scientific community to study the origin, structures, and pathogenesis of the virus. The pandemic has spurred research publication and resulted in an unprecedented number of therapeutic proposals. Because the development of new drugs is time consuming, several strategies, including drug repurposing and repositioning, are being tested to treat patients with COVID-19. Researchers have developed several potential vaccine candidates that have shown promise in phase II and III trials. As of 12 November 2020, 164 candidate vaccines are in preclinical evaluation, and 48 vaccines are in clinical evaluation, of which three have cleared phase III trials (Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2, Gamaleya's Sputnik V, and Moderna's mRNA-1273 vaccine).

Although data on the prevalence of AF is well established, its effect on mortality and survival has been inconsistent. The study aims to assess the mortality risk in Covid-19 patients who had AF during hospitalization. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients admitted with a PCR confirmed COVID 19. We estimated 7-day and 30-day mortality through Kaplan-Meier survival curves and covariate-adjusted logistic regression and Cox Proportional Hazards models. We also obtained patient demographics, length of stay (LOS), Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, and co-morbidities, including the history of asthma, Diabetes Mellitus (DM), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension (HTN), acute kidney injury (AKI), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). RESULTS: Five hundred and fifty-four patients with COVID 19 were reviewed. A group of 82 (15%) patients were identified with AF, of which 32 (40%) patients had no prior history of AF. Compared to the non-AF group, these patients were significantly older (78 vs. 69 years old), more likely to be white (77% vs. 63%), have a longer LOS (11 vs. 7), and have an ICU admission (55% vs. 24%). They also had significantly increased 7-day (16% vs. 5%) and 30-day mortality (43% vs. 12%). Additionally, they were more likely to have a history of DM, CHF, AKI, and HTN. AF during admission was associated with an increased risk of 7-day and 30-day mortality (OR=2.28, p=0.039 and OR = 3.56, p < 0.001, respectively). This group also had a significantly lower survival probability at 7 days and 30 days (p=0.005, p < 0.0001, respectively). New-onset AF was associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality (OR = 5.72 p < 0.001) and lower survival probability at 30 days (p=0.005) only. Cox Proportional Hazards regression analysis for AF on admission and new-onset AF were significant at 30-days (HR=1.9 [1.2-3] p=0.0037 and HR=2 [1.1-3.4] p=0.0173, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that COVID 19 patients with AF have significantly worse outcomes than patients without AF. In our population, since AF patients were older and had more co-comorbidities, higher LOS, and ICU admission, a cause-and-effect relationship cannot be confidently determined. However, adjusting for these co-variates still produced a statistically significant negative effect on mortality and survival. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The driving force behind the high incidence of AF, whether due to systemic illness or Covid 19 infection, remains to be determined, but it should be noted that COVID 19 patients with AF, especially new-onset AF have higher mortality.

It is not clear whether vimentin has a role in PCV2 infection nor how it affects PCV2 infection. In this study, the function of vimentin in PK-15 cells infected with PCV2 has been elucidated. We found that vimentin had a restrictive effect on the replication of PCV2 in PK-15 cells. Overexpression of vimentin by transferred pCAGGS-vimentin and down-regulation by the respective scrambled small interfering RNA showed that vimentin restricted the replication and virion production of PCV2. A special interaction between vimentin and PCV2 Cap protein was observed using laser confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation assay. Moreover, overexpression of vimentin could decrease NF-κB activity and increase PCV2-induced caspase-3 activity in PK-15 cells.

We aimed to identify the effects of lockdown on their glycemic status, lifestyle changes and psychosocial health. METHODS: The pre- and post-lockdown data of 110 T2D adults who were under regular follow up was collected by direct interview during their visit to the diabetes clinic. The variables analyzed included demographic data, HbA1c, body weight, lifestyle changes, psychosocial factors and use of technology. RESULT: The overall physical activity and dietary adherence remained unchanged in more than 80% of the participants. There was increased consumption of vegetables (80.9%), fruits (42.7%), and decreased unhealthy snacking (63%). 90% of them had access to medications. No significant change was noted in the mean HbA1c and body weight before and after lockdown. Most of them (99%) watched television and 73.6% of them spent time with their family members. Those with mental stress and poor sleep had unhealthy dietary habits. Poor glycemic control was seen in those with less physical activity and an unhealthy diet. CONCLUSION: Lockdown did not cause a major change in the overall glycemic control. Measures to promote healthy lifestyle practices along with ways to reduce psychosocial stress must be implemented for better T2D management during such restricted times.","Sankar, Prasanth; Ahmed, Waseem N.; Mariam Koshy, Vineetha; Jacob, Rittin; Sasidharan, Saranya",Diabetes Metab Syndr,100,21

M(pro) is highly conserved among all seven human coronaviruses, with certain M(pro) inhibitors having broad-spectrum antiviral activity. In this study, we designed two hybrid inhibitors UAWJ9-36-1 and UAWJ9-36-3 based on the superimposed X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) with GC-376, telaprevir, and boceprevir. Both UAWJ9-36-1 and UAWJ9-36-3 showed potent binding and enzymatic inhibition against the M(pro)’s from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-HKU1. Cell-based Flip-GFP M(pro) assay results show that UAWJ9-36-1 and UAWJ9-36-3 inhibited the intracellular protease activity of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). In addition, UAWJ9-36-1 and UAWJ9-36-3 had potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E, with UAWJ9-36-3 being more potent than GC-376 in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. Selectivity profiling revealed that UAWJ9-36-1 and UAWJ9-36-3 had an improved selectivity index over that of GC-376 against host cysteine proteases calpain I and cathepsin L, but not cathepsin K. The X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) with UAWJ9-36-1 and UAWJ9-36-3 were both solved at 1.9 Å, which validated our design hypothesis. Overall, hybrid inhibitors UAWJ9-36-1 and UAWJ9-36-3 are promising candidates to be further developed as broad-spectrum coronavirus antivirals.","Xia, Zilei; Sacco, Michael; Hu, Yanmei; Ma, Chunlong; Meng, Xiangzhi; Zhang, Fushun; Szeto, Tommy; Xiang, Yan; Chen, Yu; Wang, Jun",ACS Pharmacol Transl Sci,100,21

Immune evasion mutations that maintain virulence and fitness such as N439K can emerge within SARS-CoV-2 S, highlighting the need for ongoing molecular surveillance to guide development and usage of vaccines and therapeutics.","Thomson, Emma C.; Rosen, Laura E.; Shepherd, James G.; Spreafico, Roberto; da Silva Filipe, Ana; Wojcechowskyj, Jason A.; Davis, Chris; Piccoli, Luca; Pascall, David J.; Dillen, Josh; Lytras, Spyros; Czudnochowski, Nadine; Shah, Rajiv; Meury, Marcel; Jesudason, Natasha; De Marco, Anna; Li, Kathy; Bassi, Jessica; O’Toole, Aine; Pinto, Dora; Colquhoun, Rachel M.; Culap, Katja; Jackson, Ben; Zatta, Fabrizia; Rambaut, Andrew; Jaconi, Stefano; Sreenu, Vattipally B.; Nix, Jay; Jarrett, Ruth F.; Beltramello, Martina; Nomikou, Kyriaki; Pizzuto, Matteo; Tong, Lily; Cameroni, Elisabetta; Johnson, Natasha; Wickenhagen, Arthur; Ceschi, Alessandro; Mair, Daniel; Ferrari, Paolo; Smollett, Katherine; Sallusto, Federica; Carmichael, Stephen; Garzoni, Christian; Nichols, Jenna; Galli, Massimo; Hughes, Joseph; Riva, Agostino; Ho, Antonia; Semple, Malcolm G.; Openshaw, Peter J.M.; Baillie, J.

We explore the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the welfare of remittance-dependent households using a dataset collected in the Philippines prior to the outbreak. First, we confirm that remittances are associated with welfare of households, particularly for those whose head is male or lower educated. Then, we use the revision of the 2020 GDP projections before and after the COVID-19 crisis to gauge potential impacts on households caused by the pandemic. We find that remittance inflow will decrease by 14–20% and household spending per capita will decline by 1–2% (food expenditure per capita by 2–3%) in one year as a result of the pandemic.","Murakami, Enerelt; Shimizutani, Satoshi; Yamada, Eiji",Econ Disaster Clim Chang,100,1

In this study, the garlic-derived nanovesicles (GDVs) were isolated and digested with trypsin to remove all surface proteins. Digested GDVs showed less uptake compared to undigested GDVs, confirming that the surface proteins played a role in the endocytosis. On the cell side (HepG2), interestingly, blocking the CD98 receptors significantly reduced the uptake of GDVs. During the cellular internalization of GDVs, we observed that some surface proteins of GDVs were co-localized with CD98. A total lysate of the GDV surface showed a high presence of a mannose-specific binding protein, II lectin. Blocking GDV II lectin (using mannose preincubation) highly reduced the GDV internalization, which supports that direct interaction between II lectin and CD98 plays an important role in internalization. The GDVs also exhibited in vitro anti-inflammatory effect by downregulating proinflammatory factors on the HepG2 cells. This work contributes to understanding a part of the GDV internalization process and the cellular anti-inflammatory effects of garlic.","Song, Heliang; Canup, Brandon S.

Nowadays, several alternatives considering sources and quantity of protein, fat and carbohydrates have arisen and clinical evidence supports all of them for at least some metabolic outcomes. Given this variety in diets and the lack of a single ideal diet, one must evaluate if patients at risk, many of which having a lower income, can actually afford these diets. Aim: We modelled four-week food plans for a typical family of two adults and two school children based on seven different dietary patterns: highly processed standard omnivore diet (HPSD), freshly cooked standard omnivore diet (FCSD), both with German average dietary composition, low-protein vegan diet (VeganD), low-fat vegetarian diet (VegetD), low-fat omnivore diet (LFD), Mediterranean diet (MedD) and high-fat moderate-carb diet (MCD). The isocaloric diets were designed with typical menu variation for all meal times. We then assessed the lowest possible prices for all necessary grocery items in 12 different supermarket chains, avoiding organic foods, special offers, advertised exotic super foods and luxury articles. Prices for dietary patterns were compared in total, stratified by meal time and by food groups. Results: Among all seven dietary patterns, price dispersion by supermarket chains was 12–16%. Lowest average costs were calculated for the VegetD and the FCSD, followed by HPSD, LFD, VeganD, MedD and—on top—MCD. VeganD, MedD and MCD were about 16%, 23% and 67% more expensive compared to the FCSD. Major food groups determining prices for all diets are vegetables, salads and animal-derived products. Calculations for social welfare severely underestimate expenses for any kind of diet. Conclusions: Food prices are a relevant factor for healthy food choices. Food purchasing is financially challenging for persons with very low income in Germany. Fresh-cooked plant-based diets are less pricy than the unhealthy HPSD. Diets with reduced carbohydrate content are considerably more expensive, limiting their use for people with low income. Minimum wage and financial support for long-term unemployed people in Germany are insufficient to assure a healthy lifestyle.","Kabisch, Stefan; Wenschuh, Sören; Buccellato, Palina; Spranger, Joachim; Pfeiffer, Andreas F.H.",Nutrients,100,14

First, based on the indicator system of overseas investment risks, five major types of investment risks are identified. Second, the Deep Neural Network (DNN) is introduced; a risk evaluation model is constructed for enterprise overseas investment. Finally, the investment attractiveness index in the Fraser risk assessment learning label is adopted as the evaluation results of the model. According to the classification of risks, the model is trained and its performance is tested. The results show that the major source of overseas investment risks includes basic resources, political systems, economic and financial development, and environmental protection. The corresponding risk score is high. North American country clusters and Oceanian country clusters have lower investment risks, while the investment risks in Africa, Latin America, and Asia are affected by multiple factors of the specific cities. This is closely related to the resources and legal systems possessed by the country clusters. This is of great significance for enterprises to conduct risk assessment in overseas investment.","Xu, Xiuyan",PLoS One,100,16

To assess the distribution of AvRVs in chickens and turkeys, we have developed specific PCR protocols. These protocols were applied in two field studies investigating faecal samples or intestinal contents of diseased birds derived from several European countries and Bangladesh. In the first study, samples of 166 chickens and 33 turkeys collected between 2005 and 2008 were tested by PAGE and conventional RT-PCR and AvRVs were detected in 46.2%. In detail, 16.1% and 39.2% were positive for AvRVs of groups A or D, respectively. 11.1% of the samples contained both of them and only four samples (2.0%) contained rotaviruses showing a PAGE pattern typical for groups F and G. In the second study, samples from 375 chickens and 18 turkeys collected between 2009 and 2010 were analyzed using a more sensitive group A-specific and a new group D-specific real-time RT-PCR. In this survey, 85.0% were AvRV-positive, 58.8% for group A AvRVs, 65.9% for group D AvRVs and 38.9% for both of them. Although geographical differences exist, the results generally indicate a very high prevalence of group A and D rotaviruses in chicken and turkey flocks with cases of diarrhoea, growth retardation or RSS. The newly developed diagnostic tools will help to investigate the epidemiology and clinical significance of AvRV infections in poultry.","Otto, Peter H.; Ahmed, Muzahed Uddin; Hotzel, Helmut; Machnowska, Patrycja; Reetz, Jochen; Roth, Bernhard; Trojnar, Eva; Johne, Reimar",Vet Microbiol,100,0

(2) Methods: We recruited teens with EDs from social media in two phases: (1) Discovery Group, (2) Testing Group. The Discovery Group (n = 14) participants were recruited from Facebook/Instagram and were asked to review the app for up to one week and provide qualitative feedback. After incorporating feedback from the Discovery Group, we refined our social media outreach methods to connect with 30 teens with EDs to pilot this mobile app. Recruitment from a variety of platforms on social media was successful, with the majority of enrolled participants in the Testing Group coming from Snapchat (60%) and a large percentage of participants belonging to gender and sexual minority groups (63%). (3) Results: Participants from both groups experienced extremely high rates of depression (100% Discovery, 90% Testing) and/or anxiety symptoms (100% Discovery, 93% Testing) in addition to ED symptoms, and noted this as a possible barrier to app engagement. (4) Conclusion: Use of social media for recruitment of teens with EDs is feasible and may connect with groups who may be more difficult to reach using traditional recruitment methods. Among the Discovery Group there was high acceptability of and interest in an app to support ED recovery, and characteristics of both groups demonstrated need for support in other mental health domains.

In cancer patients (pts) the lethality has been higher than in normal population, but, little is known on the impact in adults with ALL. Our objective was to analyze the frequency, clinical characteristics and outcome of adult ALL patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Methods. Between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 (the period of the peak of COVID-19 infection in Spain) two registries from the PETHEMA (Programa Español de Tratamientos en Hematologia) and GETH (Grupo Español de Trasplante Hematopoyético y Terapia Celular) groups were activated to recruit adult patients with ALL and COVID-19 infection confirmed by PCR. The PETHEMA registry was based on ASH proposal (www.ashresearchcollaborative.org/covid-19-registry) and the GETH registry was specifically performed for hematological diseases and COVID-19 infection. Both registries were merged for this study. Eighty-four Spanish centers were contacted and weekly reminds were sent until May 19, 2020. The demographic and clinical characteristics of ALL and COVID-19 infection, the comorbidities, the treatment and outcome were collected. The study was closed for follow in July 10, 2020. Results. Fifty-six of 84 centers answered the survey and 28 patients with ALL and COVID-19 infection were identified in 17 of them, especially on March (n=11) and April (n=15). Median age was 46 (range 20-78) yrs. and 19 were aged over 40 yrs. Fifteen pts were male, 1 was active smoker and 9 showed one or more comorbidities (chronic liver disease [n=2] diabetes [n=1], hypertension [n=5], cardiopathy [n=2], prior malignancy [n=1] and hypogammaglobulinemia [n=1]). ALL was of B-cell precursors in 18 pts (Ph+ in 6) and T in 10. Twenty-six pts were on treatment of LAL (induction [n=10], consolidation [n=3], maintenance [n=1], HSCT [n=5], rescue [n=6], and palliative [n=1]). Eight patients were previously submitted to allogeneic HSCT, CAR T [n=1] or immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies (inotuzumab, n=4) and 21 were receiving immunosuppressive drugs (corticosteroids in 11, fludarabine in 4, among others). Eleven pts showed neutropenia <0.5x109/L and 18 lymphocytopenia <0.5x109/L. Median value of C reactive protein was 28.7 mg/L (0.9-311.7) and D-dimer 690 ng/mL (120-31,200). The main clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection were: fever (n=18), cough (n=16), shortness of breath (n=9) and asthenia (n=11) and 5 pts were asymptomatic. The most frequency therapies were hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (n=23), combined or not with lopinavir/ritonavir. Tocilizumab was given to 8 pts. Twelve pts required oxygen supply and 7 required ICU support (median stay 16 [1-47] days). COVID-19 was solved in 18 pts, although 5 pts showed PCR+ persistence (median 25 [16-91] days) after resolution of symptoms. The treatment of ALL was stopped/modified in 11 pts. Nine pts dead (COVID-19 [n=6], COVID-19 and ALL progression [n=2] and COVID-19 andPseudomonassepsis [n=1]). A trend for higher mortality was observed in patients with neutropenia <0.5x109/L and in those with lymphocytopenia <0.5x109/L. Conclusion. The frequency of adult patients with ALL and COVID-19 infection can be considered high, given the low incidence of adult ALL. COVID-19 infection was frequent in patients with advanced age and on ALL therapy. The frequency of severe COVID-19 infection and the mortality were high.

In this article we reviewed the strategies of escalation and de-escalation put in place at a large university hospital in Madrid during the COVID-19 outbreak, in order to meet the growing demand of ICU beds. Materials and methods The data displayed originated from the hospital information system and the hospital contingency plan. Results The COVID-19 outbreak produced a surge of ICU patients which saturated the available ICU capacity within a few days. A total of four new ICUs had to be opened in order to accommodate all necessary new ICU admissions. Management challenges included infrastructure, material allocation and ICU staffing. Through the strategies put in place the hospital was able to generate a surge capacity of ICU beds of 340%, meet all requirements and also maintain minimal surgical activity. Conclusions Hospital surge capacity is to date hardly quantifiable and often has to face physical limitations (material, personnel, spaces). However an extremely flexible and adaptable management strategy can help to overcome some of these limitations and stretch the system capacities during times of extreme need.","Bardi, T.; Gomez-Rojo, M.; Candela-Toha, A.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architectures proposed over the recent years for medical image classification. Specifically, the procedure called Transfer Learning was adopted. With transfer learning, the detection of various abnormalities in small medical image datasets is an achievable target, often yielding remarkable results. The datasets utilized in this experiment are two. Firstly, a collection of 1427 X-ray images including 224 images with confirmed Covid-19 disease, 700 images with confirmed common bacterial pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions. Secondly, a dataset including 224 images with confirmed Covid-19 disease, 714 images with confirmed bacterial and viral pneumonia, and 504 images of normal conditions. The data was collected from the available X-ray images on public medical repositories. The results suggest that Deep Learning with X-ray imaging may extract significant biomarkers related to the Covid-19 disease, while the best accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity obtained is 96.78%, 98.66%, and 96.46% respectively. Since by now, all diagnostic tests show failure rates such as to raise concerns, the probability of incorporating X-rays into the diagnosis of the disease could be assessed by the medical community, based on the findings, while more research to evaluate the X-ray approach from different aspects may be conducted.","Apostolopoulos, Ioannis D.; Mpesiana, Tzani A.",Phys Eng Sci Med,100,6

We developed a new experimental system in pigs to closely evaluate the process by which H(2) is absorbed in the lungs, enters the bloodstream, and is distributed, metabolized, and excreted. We inserted and secured catheters into the carotid artery (CA), portal vein (PV), and supra-hepatic inferior vena cava (IVC) to allow repeated blood sampling and performed bilateral thoracotomy to collapse the lungs. Then, using a hydrogen-absorbing alloy canister, we filled the lungs to the maximum inspiratory level with 100% H(2). The pig was maintained for 30 seconds without resuming breathing, as if they were holding their breath. We collected blood from the three intravascular catheters after 0, 3, 10, 30, and 60 minutes and measured H(2) concentration by gas chromatography. H(2) concentration in the CA peaked immediately after breath holding; 3 min later, it dropped to 1/40 of the peak value. Peak H(2) concentrations in the PV and IVC were 40% and 14% of that in the CA, respectively. However, H(2) concentration decay in the PV and IVC (half-life: 310 s and 350 s, respectively) was slower than in the CA (half-life: 92 s). At 10 min, H(2) concentration was significantly higher in venous blood than in arterial blood. At 60 min, H(2) was detected in the portal blood at a concentration of 6.9–53 nL/mL higher than at steady state, and in the SVC 14–29 nL/mL higher than at steady state. In contrast, H(2) concentration in the CA decreased to steady state levels. This is the first report showing that inhaled H(2) is transported to the whole body by advection diffusion and metabolized dynamically.","Sano, Motoaki; Ichihara, Genki; Katsumata, Yoshinori; Hiraide, Takahiro; Hirai, Akeo; Momoi, Mizuki; Tamura, Tomoyoshi; Ohata, Shigeo; Kobayashi, Eiji",PLoS One,100,20

However, limited basic science and clinical studies have been performed to address the potential disease specific immune-mediated mechanisms causing secondary glomerular pathology, its various types of presentation, and the potential treatments. CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old man with chronic active rheumatoid arthritis presented with nephrotic syndrome and was found to have membranous nephropathy with eosinophilic intracapillary thrombi on renal biopsy. Proteinuria persisted despite complete withdrawal from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Throughout the disease course, he developed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis and pulmonary sarcoidosis, both of which achieved clinical resolution with glucocorticoids. However, only partial improvement was observed in proteinuria with treatment of steroids and Rituximab. CONCLUSION: Our case presented a unique and complicated clinical phenotype of active rheumatoid arthritis, with clinical features of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, histopathologic features of membranous and cryoglobulinemic nephropathy in the absence of DMARDs use, as well as pulmonary sarcoidosis. We speculate that there is a wider spectrum of glomerular disease in patients with untreated rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the potential association between rheumatoid arthritis and cryoglobulinemic vasculitis should probably be revisited and requires further studies to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and treatment options.","Wang, Qiyu; Ruiz, Juan P.; Hart, Peter D.",BMC Nephrol,100,21

The sensitivity of the Roche, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant and Siemens antibody assays was 94.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 84.3-98.8 %), 98.1 % (95% CI: 89.9-100 %) and 100 % (95% CI: 93.3-100 %). The sensitivity of the N-based Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and the glycoprotein-based Euroimmun ELISA was 45.3 % (95% CI: 31.6-59.6 %) and 83.3 % (95% CI: 70.2-91.9 %). The nucleoprotein-based Roche and the glycoprotein-based Abbott receptor binding domain (RBD) and Siemens tests were more sensitive than the N-based Abbott and the Euroimmun antibody tests (p=0.0001 to p=0.039). The N-based Abbott antibody test was less sensitive 6 months than 4-10 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection (p = 0.0001). The findings show that most SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays correctly identified previous infection 6 months after infection. The sensitivity of pan-Ig antibody tests was not reduced at 6 months when IgM antibodies have usually disappeared. However, one of the nucleoprotein-based antibody tests significantly lost diagnostic sensitivity over time.","Kannenberg, Judith; Schnurra, Carolin; Reiners, Nina; Henschler, Reinhard; Buhmann, Raymund; Kaiser, Thorsten; Biemann, Ronald; Hönemann, Mario; Ackermann, Grit; Trawinski, Henning; Jassoy, Christian",Journal of Clinical Virology Plus,100,26

Thus, it is important to assess people’s perception of stress during COVID-19 for both research and practical purposes. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is one of the most widely used instruments to measure perceived stress; however, previous validation studies focused on specific populations, possibly limiting the generalization of results. (2) Methods: This study tested the psychometric properties of three versions of the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS-14, CPSS-10, and CPSS-4) in the Chinese general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. A commercial online survey was employed to construct a nationally representative sample of 1133 adults in Mainland China (548 males and 585 females) during a one-week period. (3) Results: The two-factor (positivity and negativity) solution for the three versions of the CPSS showed a good fit with the data. The CPSS-14 and CPSS-10 had very good reliability and the CPSS-4 showed acceptable reliability, supporting the concurrent validity of the CPSS. (4) Conclusions: All three versions of the CPSS appear to be appropriate for use in research with samples of adults in the Chinese general population under the COVID-19 crisis. The CPSS-10 and CPSS-14 both have strong psychometric properties, but the CPSS-10 would have more utility because it is shorter than the CPSS-14. However, the CPSS-4 is an acceptable alternative when administration time is limited.","She, Zhuang; Li, Dan; Zhang, Wei; Zhou, Ningning; Xi, Juzhe; Ju, Kang",Int J Environ Res Public Health,100,1

A new influenza A/H1N1 (pH1N1) virus emerged in April 2009, proceeded to spread worldwide, and was designated as an influenza pandemic. A/H1N1 viruses had circulated in 1918–1957 and 1977–2009 and were in the annual vaccine during 1977–2009. Methods. Serum antibody to the pH1N1 and seasonal A/H1N1 viruses was measured in 579 healthy adults at enrollment (fall 2009) and after surveillance for illness (spring 2010). Subjects reporting with moderate to severe acute respiratory illness had illness and virus quantitation for 1 week; evaluations for missed illnesses were conducted over holiday periods and at the spring 2010 visit. Results. After excluding 66 subjects who received pH1N1 vaccine, 513 remained. Seventy-seven had reported with moderate to severe illnesses; 31 were infected with pH1N1 virus, and 30 with a rhinovirus. Determining etiology from clinical findings was not possible, but fever and prominent myalgias favored influenza and prominent rhinorrhea favored rhinovirus. Tests of fall and spring antibody indicated pH1N1 infection of 23% had occurred, with the rate decreasing with increasing anti-pH1N1 antibody; a similar pattern was seen for influenza-associated illness. A reducing frequency of pH1N1 infections was also seen with increasing antibody to the recent seasonal A/H1N1 virus (A/Brisbane/59/07). Preexisting antibody to pH1N1 virus, responses to a single vaccine dose, a low infection-to-illness ratio, and a short duration of illness and virus shedding among those with influenza indicated presence of considerable preexisting immunity to pH1N1 in the population. Conclusions. The 2009 A/H1N1 epidemic among healthy adults was relatively mild, most likely because of immunity from prior infections with A/H1N1 viruses.","Couch, Robert B.; Atmar, Robert L.; Franco, Luis M.; Quarles, John M.; Niño, Diane; Wells, Janet M.; Arden, Nancy; Cheung, Sheree; Belmont, John W.",Clinical Infectious Diseases,100,30

The most striking manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 is atypical pneumonia and respiratory complications; however, various neurological manifestations are now well recognized. Currently, there have been very few case reports regarding COVID-19 in patients with a known history of myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis (MG) causes muscle weakness, especially respiratory muscles, in high-risk COVID-19 patients, which can lead to severe respiratory compromise. There are few reported cases of severe myasthenia crisis following COVID-19, likely due to the involvement of the respiratory apparatus and the use of immunosuppressive medication. We report the first case of ocular MG developing secondary to COVID-19 infection in a 65-year-old woman. Two weeks prior to hospitalization, the patient suffered from cough, fever, and diarrhea and was found to be positive for COVID-19 via a nasopharyngeal RT-PCR swab test. The electrodiagnostic test showed decremental response over more than 10% on repetitive nerve stimulation test of orbicularis oculi. She tested positive for antibodies against acetylcholine receptor. COVID-19 is known to cause the release of inflammatory cytokines, leading to immune-mediated damage.

To complement existing models in rodents and non-human primates, we have evaluated the potential benefits of an HRSV infection model in ferrets (Mustela putorius furo). Nine- to 12-month-old HRSV-seronegative immunocompetent or immunocompromised ferrets were infected with a low-passage wild-type strain of HRSV subgroup A (10(5) TCID(50)) administered by intra-tracheal or intra-nasal inoculation. Immune suppression was achieved by bi-daily oral administration of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone. Throat and nose swabs were collected daily and animals were euthanized four, seven, or 21 days post-infection (DPI). Virus loads were determined by quantitative virus culture and qPCR. We observed efficient HRSV replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tract. In immunocompromised ferrets, virus loads reached higher levels and showed delayed clearance as compared to those in immunocompetent animals. Histopathological evaluation of animals euthanized 4 DPI demonstrated that the virus replicated in the respiratory epithelial cells of the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles.

Cholesterol enriched lipid rafts represent a platform for viruses to enter the host cell by endocytosis. Generally, higher membrane cholesterol coincides with higher efficiency of COVID-19 entry. Inversely, patients with COVID-19 show lowered levels of blood cholesterol, high-density and low-density lipoproteins. The modulated efficiency of viral entry can be explained by availability of SR-B1 and LDL-receptors. Especially HDL seems to have a variety of roles, from being itself a scavenger for viruses, an immune modulator and mediator of viral entry. Due to inverse roles of membrane cholesterol and lipoprotein cholesterol in COVID-19 infected patients, treatment of these patients with cholesterol lowering statins remains controversial. In conclusion, cholesterol and lipoproteins are potential markers for monitoring the viral infection status where mechanistic inconsistencies warrant immediate further research.","Kočar, Eva; Režen, Tadeja; Rozman, Damjana",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Biol Lipids,100,16

Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) was applied for assessing quality of included studies and Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA) was followed for reporting. We included 81 studies from 65 research articles on POCTs of SARS, MERS and COVID-19. Most studies had high risk of patient selection and index test bias but low risk in other domains. Diagnostic specificities were high (> 0.95) for included studies while sensitivities varied depending on type of assays and sample used. Most studies (n = 51) used reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to diagnose coronaviruses. RT-LAMP of RNA purified from COVID-19 patient samples had pooled sensitivity at 0.94 (95% CI: 0.90–0.96). RT-LAMP of crude samples had substantially lower sensitivity at 0.78 (95% CI: 0.65–0.87). Abbott ID Now performance was similar to RT-LAMP of crude samples. Diagnostic performances by CRISPR and RT-LAMP on purified RNA were similar. Other diagnostic platforms including RT- recombinase assisted amplification (RT-RAA) and SAMBA-II also offered high sensitivity (> 0.95).

We performed this cross-sectional study to assess the levels and determinants of public KAP towards COVID-19 in a large, multinational sample. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study (survey). SETTING: The questionnaire was distributed to potential respondents via online platforms. PARTICIPANTS: 71 890 individuals from 22 countries. METHODS: We formulated a four-section questionnaire in English, followed by validation and translation into seven languages. The questionnaire was distributed (May to June 2020) and each participant received a score for each KAP section. RESULTS: Overall, the participants had fair knowledge (mean score: 19.24±3.59) and attitudes (3.72±2.31) and good practices (12.12±1.83) regarding COVID-19. About 92% reported moderate to high compliance with national lockdown. However, significant gaps were observed: only 68.2% knew that infected individuals may be asymptomatic; 45.4% believed that antibiotics are an effective treatment; and 55.4% stated that a vaccine has been developed (at the time of data collection). 71.9% believed or were uncertain that COVID-19 is a global conspiracy; 36.8% and 51% were afraid of contacting doctors and Chinese people, respectively. Further, 66.4% reported the pandemic had moderate to high negative effects on their mental health. Female gender, higher education and urban residents had significantly (p≤0.001) higher knowledge and practice scores. Further, we observed significant correlations between all KAP scores. CONCLUSIONS: Although the public have fair/good knowledge and practices regarding COVID-19, significant gaps should be addressed.

One way to understand why people differ in their attitudes is to examine how personality traits predict the degree to which people hold different attitudes. METHODS: We collected data (N = 1420) from Portugal and Spain using Facebook advertising. We measured the Dark Triad and Big Five traits, and negative affect, along with ad hoc items for religiousness, and attitudes towards and fear of COVID. RESULTS: Neuroticism and Negative affect was linked to various domains of insecurity or fear and provides insights into how personality predicts concerns and behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Religious people were less trusting in science, thought prayer was answer, and attributed the existence of the virus to an act of God. Women reported more fear of COVID-19 than men did, and this was enabled by women’s greater tendency to have Negative Affect and higher Neuroticism than men. CONCLUSIONS: Neurotic people and those with more Negative Affect appear to be more fearful, more trusting in others and systems likely to protect them (e.g., scientists), and less likely to trust in systems shown to not help them (e.g., prayer). We found other effects for the Dark Triad traits and the Big Five traits. In total, we highlight some of the reasons that people may be in such disagreements about what to do about the virus at the individual and institutional levels. Personality, place, and participant’s sex all appear to play a role in the psychology of COVID-19 beliefs.","Brito-Costa, Sonia; Jonason, Peter K; Tosi, Michele; Antunes, Rui; Silva, Sofia; Castro, Florêncio",Eur J Public Health,100,21

This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a topical triamcinolone-loaded liposome formulation (TALF) as an adjuvant to intravitreal RBZ therapy in treatment- naïve patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Subjects were randomly assigned to the RBZ-TALF or the RBZ-pro re nata (RBZ-PRN) groups. Patients from the RBZ-TALF group were instructed to apply TALF for 12 months after a single dose of RBZ. Patients from the RBZ-PRN group received three monthly RBZ-IVTs. Retreatment with RBZ was considered in the case of nAMD reactivation. Regarding safety, non-ocular abnormalities were observed during TALF therapy. Concerning efficacy, non-significant differences were identified in terms of visual acuity or central foveal thickness when the RBZ-PRN and RBZ-TALF groups were compared. It is worth noting that the average number of RBZ injections was significantly lower in the RBZ-TALF group (2.5 ± 1.4 vs. 6.1 ± 1.3 IVTs; p = 0.0004).

The phenomenon has been implicated in critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus implicated in COVID-19. Critically ill COVID-19 patients experiencing cytokine storm are believed to have a worse prognosis and increased fatality rate. In SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, cytokine storm appears important to the pathogenesis of several severe manifestations of COVID-19: acute respiratory distress syndrome, thromboembolic diseases such as acute ischemic strokes caused by large vessel occlusion and myocardial infarction, encephalitis, acute kidney injury, and vasculitis (Kawasaki-like syndrome in children and renal vasculitis in adult). Understanding the pathogenesis of cytokine storm will help unravel not only risk factors for the condition but also therapeutic strategies to modulate the immune response and deliver improved outcomes in COVID-19 patients at high risk for severe disease.

Group A received the same education that was used the previous year (i.e., four hours of theoretical lectures followed by four hours of practical exercises performed on a fellow student). Group B did their practical training on fellow students in groups of three, with each student taking turns performing, receiving and observing the procedure. Group C received training using an anatomically correct model before their practical training on a fellow student. After each training step, the students completed a questionnaire about their confidence administering local anaesthesia.

This serious outbreak and the precipitously increasing numbers of deaths worldwide necessitated the urgent need to develop an effective severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. The development of COVID-19 vaccines has moved quickly. In this study, we assessed the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of an inactivated (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and its lot to lot consistency. A total of 1620 healthy adults aged 18–59 years were randomly assigned to receive 2 injections of the trial vaccine or placebo on a day 0 and 14 schedule. This article was based on an interim report completed within 3 months following the last dose of study vaccine. The interim analysis includes safety and immunogenicity data for 540 participants in the immunogenicity subset and an efficacy analysis of the 1620 subjects. For the safety evaluation, solicited and unsolicited adverse events were collected after the first and second vaccination within 14 and 28 days, respectively. Blood samples were collected for an antibody assay before and 14 days following the second dose. RESULTS: Most of the adverse reactions were in the solicited category and were mild in severity. Pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported symptom. Antibody IgG titer determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was 97.48% for the seroconversion rate. Using a neutralization assay, the seroconversion rate was 87.15%. The efficacy in preventing symptomatic confirmed cases of COVID-19 occurring at least 14 days after the second dose of vaccine using an incidence rate was 65.30%. CONCLUSIONS: From the 3-month interim analysis, the vaccine exhibited a 65.30% efficacy at preventing COVID-19 illness with favorable safety and immunogenicity profiles.","Fadlyana, Eddy; Rusmil, Kusnandi; Tarigan, Rodman; Reza Rahmadi, Andri; Prodjosoewojo, Susantina; Sofiatin, Yulia; V Khrisna, Citra; Mulia Sari, Rini; Setyaningsih, Lilis; Surachman, Fikrianti; Sjafri Bachtiar, Novilia; Sukandar, Hadyana; Megantara, Imam; Murad, Chrysanti; Nur A Pangesti, Krisna; Setiawati, Vivi; Sudigdoadi, Sunarjati; Hu, Yaling; Gao, Qiang; Kartasasmita, Cissy B",Vaccine,100,20

Existing curricula emphasize tenets of patient safety but rarely address the impact of medical errors on health care providers, particularly at the undergraduate level. The authors developed an interactive session exploring the professional and personal effects of medical errors for 300 second-year medical students. METHODS: The session utilized case-based learning, small group discussion, and video vignettes. Physicians in multiple specialties were interviewed, sharing narrative accounts of their experience with medical errors and adverse events. Discussions were facilitated by local physicians, who delivered content and shared personal anecdotes. Surveys using a 5-point Likert scale were conducted before and after the session. RESULTS: Pre- and post-test surveys resulted in 91 responses in 2016 and 174 in 2017. In 2016, results showed significant change in student responses by 0.34 units (SD 0.35 units; p < 0.001). Two survey items addressing student awareness and three items addressing confidence were significant. The domains assessing students’ attitudes and knowledge regarding medical errors were not significant. In 2017, the overall mean change was 0.33 with a lower standard error, 0.03 (p < 0.001), showing significance in both years the session was delivered. CONCLUSION: A 1-h, small-group session increased medical students’ understanding of the impact of medical errors and adverse events on providers and the supportive resources available. Recruitment of local faculty to facilitate discussions and share personal anecdotes enhanced the success of the session.","Musunur, Swapna; Waineo, Eva; Walton, Edward; Deeds, Kathryn; Levine, Diane",Acad Psychiatry,100,20

We sought to characterize their perceptions and identify reasons underlying inappropriate use. METHODS: We conducted 12 focus groups with nurses and nursing assistants at 4 medical centers. We analyzed the thematic content of 73 discrete “stories” told by focus group participants. RESULTS: We identified 5 story types surrounding RPE use: 1) policies are known and seen during work routines; 2) during protocol lapses, use is reinforced through social norms; 3) clinical experiences sometimes supersede protocol adherence; 4) when risk perception is high, we found concern regarding accessing RPE; and 5) HCWs in emergency departments were viewed as not following protocol because risk was ever-present. DISCUSSION: HCWs were aware of the importance of RPE and protocols for using it, and these supported use when protocol lapses occurred. However, protocol adherence was undermined by clinical experience, perceived risk, and the distinct context of the emergency department where patients continually arrive with incomplete or delayed diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Protocols, visual cues, and social norms contribute to a culture of safety. This culture can be undermined when HCWs experience diagnostic uncertainty or they mistrust the protocol and instead rely on their clinical experiences.","Fix, Gemmae M.; Reisinger, Heather Schacht; Etchin, Anna; McDannold, Sarah; Eagan, Aaron; Findley, Kimberly; Gifford, Allen L.; Gupta, Kalpana; McInnes, D.

We observed the co-circulation of at least 13 different SARS-CoV-2 lineages over time, which were linked to multiple importations and characterized by large transmission clusters concomitant with a high number of infections. Subsequent implementation of a three-phase nationwide lockdown strategy greatly reduced infection numbers and hospitalizations. Yet we present evidence of sustained viral spread among sporadic clusters acting as hidden reservoirs during summer 2020. Mathematical modelling shows that increased mobility among residents eventually catalyzed the coalescence of such clusters, thus driving up the number of infections and initiating a new epidemic wave.

Furthermore, paediatric emergency departments (EDs) have rapidly adapted provision of care in response to the pandemic. This qualitative study utilized insight from multidisciplinary frontline staff to understand 1) the changes in paediatric emergency healthcare utilization during COVID-19 2) the experiences of working within the restructured health system. METHODS: Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with frontline staff working in two paediatric EDs and two mixed adult and children EDs. Participants included emergency medicine clinicians (n = 5), nursing managerial staff (n = 6), social workers (n = 2) and nursing staff (n = 2). Thematic Analysis (TA) was applied to the data to identify key themes. RESULTS: The pandemic and public health restrictions have had an adverse impact on children’s health and psychosocial wellbeing, compounded by difficulty in accessing primary and community services. The impact may have been more acute for children with disabilities and chronic health conditions and has raised child protection issues for vulnerable children. EDs have shown innovation and agility in the structural and operational changes they have implemented to continue to deliver care to children, however resource limitations and other challenges must be addressed to ensure high quality care delivery and protect the wellbeing of those tasked with delivering this care. CONCLUSIONS: The spread of COVID-19 and subsequent policies to address the pandemic has had wide-reaching implications for children’s health and wellbeing. The interruption to health and social care services is manifesting in myriad ways in the ED, such as a rise in psychosocial presentations. As the pandemic continues to progress, policy makers and service providers must ensure the continued provision of essential health and social services, including targeted responses for those with existing conditions.

We carried out an ecological study to assess the association between long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) on COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality after accounting for demographic, socioeconomic and meteorological variables. The study was based on publicly available data. Multivariable negative binomial mixed regression models were fitted, and results were reported in terms of incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMR). The effect of winter temperature and humidity was modelled through restricted cubic spline. Data from 1,439 municipalities out of 1,507 (95%) were included in the analyses, leading to a total of 61,377 COVID-19 cases and 40,401 deaths from all-causes collected from February 20(th) to April 16(th) and from March 1(st) to April 30(th), 2020, respectively. Several demographic and socioeconomic variables resulted significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality in a multivariable fashion. An increase in average winter temperature was associated with a nonlinear decrease in COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality, while an opposite trend emerged for the absolute humidity. An increase of 10 μg/m(3) in the mean annual concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 over the previous years was associated with a 58% and 34% increase in COVID-19 incidence rate, respectively. Similarly, a 10 μg/m(3) increase of annual mean PM2.5 concentration was associated with a 23% increase in all-cause mortality. An inverse association was found between NO(2) levels and COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality. Our ecological study showed that exposure to PM was significantly associated with the COVID-19 incidence and excess mortality during the first wave of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy.","de Angelis, Elena; Renzetti, Stefano; Volta, Marialuisa; Donato, Francesco; Calza, Stefano; Placidi, Donatella; Lucchini, Roberto G.; Rota, Matteo",Environ Res,100,1

This study focuses on co-designing mini games to support teaching and learning CT principles and concepts in an online environment. Online co-design (OCD) of mini games enhances students’ understanding of problem-solving through a rigorous process of designing contextual educational games to aid their own learning. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, where face-to-face co-designing between researchers and stakeholders could be difficult, OCD is a suitable option. CS students in a Nigerian higher education institution were recruited to co-design mini games with researchers. Mixed research methods comprising qualitative and quantitative strategies were employed in this study. Findings show that the participants gained relevant knowledge, for example, how to (i) create game scenarios and game elements related to CT, (ii) connect contextual storyline to mini games, (iii) collaborate in a group to create contextual low-fidelity mini game prototypes, and (iv) peer review each other’s mini game concepts.

We found that after ectodomain shedding, ACE2 is targeted for intramembrane proteolysis by γS, releasing a soluble ACE2 C-terminal fragment. Consistently, chemical or genetic inhibition of γS results in the accumulation of a membrane-bound fragment of ectodomain-deficient ACE2. Although chemical inhibition of γS does not alter SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, these data point to a novel pathway for cellular ACE2 trafficking.","Bartolomé, Alberto; Liang, Jiani; Wang, Pengfei; Ho, David D.; Pajvani, Utpal B.",Sci Rep,100,1

In the healthy lung, ATII cells coordinate the host defense mechanisms, not only generating a restrictive alveolar epithelial barrier, but also orchestrating host defense mechanisms and secreting surfactant proteins, which are important in lung protection against pathogen exposure. Moreover, surfactant proteins help to maintain homeostasis in the distal lung and reduce surface tension at the pulmonary air–liquid interface, thereby preventing atelectasis and reducing the work of breathing. ATII cells may also contribute to the fibroproliferative reaction by secreting growth factors and proinflammatory molecules after damage. Indeed, various acute and chronic diseases are associated with intensive inflammation. These include oedema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, fibrosis and numerous interstitial lung diseases, and are characterized by hyperplastic ATII cells which are considered an essential part of the epithelialization process and, consequently, wound healing. The aim of this review is that of revising the physiologic and pathologic role ATII cells play in pulmonary diseases, as, despite what has been learnt in the last few decades of research, the origin, phenotypic regulation and crosstalk of these cells still remain, in part, a mystery.","Ruaro, Barbara; Salton, Francesco; Braga, Luca; Wade, Barbara; Confalonieri, Paola; Volpe, Maria Concetta; Baratella, Elisa; Maiocchi, Serena; Confalonieri, Marco",Int J Mol Sci,100,21

Autopsy studies showed high prevalence of platelet-fibrin-rich microthrombi in several organs. The aim of the study was therefore to evaluate the safety and efficacy of antiplatelet therapy (APT) in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and its impact on survival. METHODS: 7824 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in a multicentre international prospective registry (Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation-COVID-19 Registry). Clinical data and in-hospital complications were recorded. Data on APT, including aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs, were obtained for each patient. RESULTS: During hospitalisation, 730 (9%) patients received single APT (93%, n=680) or dual APT (7%, n=50). Patients treated with APT were older (74±12 years vs 63±17 years, p<0.01), more frequently male (68% vs 57%, p<0.01) and had higher prevalence of diabetes (39% vs 16%, p<0.01). Patients treated with APT showed no differences in terms of in-hospital mortality (18% vs 19%, p=0.64), need for invasive ventilation (8.7% vs 8.5%, p=0.88), embolic events (2.9% vs 2.5% p=0.34) and bleeding (2.1% vs 2.4%, p=0.43), but had shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (8±5 days vs 11±7 days, p=0.01); however, when comparing patients with APT versus no APT and no anticoagulation therapy, APT was associated with lower mortality rates (log-rank p<0.01, relative risk 0.79, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.94). On multivariable analysis, in-hospital APT was associated with lower mortality risk (relative risk 0.39, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.48, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: APT during hospitalisation for COVID-19 could be associated with lower mortality risk and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, without increased risk of bleeding.

I discuss shortcomings in the ways that history is often used in school science, and examine how knowledge of previous pandemics might help in teaching about COVID-19. I look at the potential of issues to do with measurement in the context of COVID-19 (e.g. measurement of mortality figures) to introduce school students to issues about philosophy of science, and I show how COVID-19 has the affordance to broaden and deepen the moral philosophy that students typically meet in biology lessons. COVID-19 also provides opportunities to introduce students to sociological ways of thinking, examining data and questioning human practices. It can also enable students to see how science, economics and politics inter-relate. In the final part of the paper, I suggest that there are strong arguments in favour of an interdisciplinary approach in tackling zoonoses like COVID-19 and that there is much to be said for such interdisciplinarity in school science lessons when teaching about socio-scientific issues and issues intended to raise scientific literacy.","Reiss, Michael J.",Sci Educ (Dordr),100,1

To conserve personal protective equipment, reduce the spread of the virus, and keep student learners safe, leaders of medical schools across the country made the difficult decision to suspend in-person clinical experiences. As medical students were sent home and hospital systems ramped up their response to the virus, many essential health care workers (HCWs) faced an immediate challenge. As “nonessential” services such as schools and daycare centers abruptly closed, HCWs serving on the frontlines in inpatient settings needed a way to both fight the pandemic and care for their children. APPROACH: Medical students at Oregon Health & Science University were able to rapidly OR organize to provide childcare for essential HCWs. For roughly 8 weeks following the state of emergency (March 13 through May 15, 2020), students used Twitter and emerging technology to match families in need of childcare with a trainee volunteer. OUTCOMES: By May 15th, the service had successfully fulfilled 181 of the 202 requests for childcare (90%) over the course of 8 weeks. Of the 181 completed childcare requests, 172 (95%) were fulfilled by an individual (1:1 volunteer-to-household pairing), and 9 (5%) were fulfilled by 2 or more volunteers. NEXT STEPS: The trainees who provided childcare will apply the skills learned (e.g., clear communication, grassroots organizing, triaging, leveraging new technology) to patient care. Broader applications for this system include organizing volunteers to conduct contract tracing or to provide public health information in languages other than English. Future research includes examining the effect of the service on the productivity, morale, and mental health of both those who provided and received childcare.","Lane, Emily C.A.; Tran, Audrey A.; Graulty, Christian J.; Bumsted, Tracy",Acad Med,100,12

METHODS: A 2-year surveillance program of children presenting with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) was carried out to characterize the viral etiology and to assess whether using gene amplification and sequencing could be a reliable approach to monitor virus introduction and spread in a population subgroup. RESULTS: Using multiplex RT-PCR, 15 different respiratory viruses were detected within the 486 nasopharyngeal positive samples collected among 817 children aged <9-year old who presented with ARI during October 2006 to September 2008. A single virus was detected in 373 patients (45.7%), and two to four viruses in 113 patients (13.8%). The most frequent causative viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (24.7%), human bocavirus (24.5%), and human rhinovirus (HRV) (15%). RSV was more prevalent in winter and among young infants. Cases of seasonal influenza A and B viruses were reported mainly in January and August. An increase in adenovirus infection was observed during the spring of the second year of the study. Sequence analyses showed multiple introductions of different virus subtypes and identified a high prevalence of the newly defined HRV-C species. A higher viral incidence was observed during the winter of 2008, which was unusually cold. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the usefulness of multiplex RT-PCR for virus detection and co-infection, and for implementation of a molecular monitoring system for endemic and epidemic viral respiratory infections.","Wang, Wei; Cavailler, Philippe; Ren, Peijun; Zhang, Jing; Dong, Wei; Yan, Huajie; Mardy, Sek; Cailhol, Johann; Buchy, Philippe; Sheng, Jun; Fontanet, Arnaud; Deubel, Vincent",J Clin Virol,100,1

Infodemiology metrics have been widely and successfully used to assess and forecast epidemics and outbreaks. OBJECTIVE: In light of the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that started in Wuhan, China in 2019, online search traffic data from Google are used to track the spread of the new coronavirus disease in Europe. METHODS: Time series from Google Trends from January to March 2020 on the Topic (Virus) of “Coronavirus” were retrieved and correlated with official data on COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide and in the European countries that have been affected the most: Italy (at national and regional level), Spain, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Statistically significant correlations are observed between online interest and COVID-19 cases and deaths. Furthermore, a critical point, after which the Pearson correlation coefficient starts declining (even if it is still statistically significant) was identified, indicating that this method is most efficient in regions or countries that have not yet peaked in COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: In the past, infodemiology metrics in general and data from Google Trends in particular have been shown to be useful in tracking and forecasting outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics as, for example, in the cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome, Ebola, measles, and Zika. With the COVID-19 pandemic still in the beginning stages, it is essential to explore and combine new methods of disease surveillance to assist with the preparedness of health care systems at the regional level.","Mavragani, Amaryllis",JMIR Public Health Surveill,100,21

We performed a retrospective cohort study using real-time analysis of electronic medical records (EMR) of patients from multiple healthcare organizations in the United States. Our results showed that Black patients with COVID-19 have a significantly higher risk of mortality, hospitalization, and invasive mechanical ventilation compared to White patients. The incremental risk of poor outcomes in Blacks persists despite accounting for a higher prevalence of comorbidities. This may point to the disparities in socioeconomic determinants of health affecting Blacks and the need for an improvement in the care of this vulnerable population.","Khan, Ahmad; Chatterjee, Arka; Singh, Shailendra",,100,5

The need for a tailored, peer-led group programme was raised by parent carers, who co-developed the Healthy Parent Carers programme with researchers. This study aimed to test the feasibility of programme delivery in community settings, and the feasibility and acceptability of a randomised controlled trial design. METHODS: Participants were individually randomised with concealed allocation to a structured group programme and access to online resources (intervention), or access to the online resources only (control). Measures of wellbeing and secondary and economic outcomes were collected before randomisation, immediately post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention. Descriptive statistics on recruitment and attrition, demographics, attendance, and fidelity of intervention delivery were analysed with feedback on the acceptability of the trial design. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-three parent carers expressed an interest in taking part. Ninety-two participants recruited from across six sites were randomised (47 intervention, 45 control). Lead and assistant facilitators were trained and delivered the group sessions. Sixteen (34%) participants in the intervention arm did not attend any sessions, and attendance varied across sites and sessions. One participant withdrew post-randomisation, and 83 (90%) participants completed outcome measures at the six-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that it was feasible to deliver the programme in community settings. The number of parent carers who expressed interest signifies the need for such a programme and the feasibility of recruiting to a definitive trial. Loss to follow-up was low. Further research is needed to explore ways to reduce barriers to participation in person and assess the feasibility and acceptability of programme content and delivery for more ethnically diverse groups, and potentially using interpreters. Given the Covid-19 pandemic and delivery format feedback, there is also a need to investigate remote or blended delivery strategies. Although the results indicate that a definitive trial is feasible, programme impact would be strengthened through exploration of these uncertainties.

The extent of superinfecting virus propagation depends on the time of superinfection; there is 90% exclusion by 4 hr after the initial infection, and more than 99% by 6 hr. When superinfection is attempted at 6 hr after infection, the superinfecting virus is incapable of carrying out DNA replication or early gene transcription, demonstrating that an early event in the virus life cycle is inhibited. The rate of adsorption of the superinfecting virus is unaltered which shows that exclusion is affected at a point between adsorption and early gene transcription. In order to exclude superinfection, the primary infecting virus does not require replication of its DNA or expression of its late genes but it must express one or more early genes.","Christen, Linda; Seto, Janny; Niles, Edward G.",Virology,100,29

The request to stay at home particularly applied to cancer patients, who were considered at higher risk for infection and severe events. Patients had to experience substantial psychosocial implications of mass quarantine and they were also faced with special challenges to receive safe cancer care. This study aimed to investigate the perspectives of people living with cancer during mass quarantine. Method(s): The Italian Association of Cancer Nurses (AIIAO) conducted an online survey from March 29th to May 3rd, 2020, which corresponds to 'Phase One' of the COVID-19 Italian emergency plan. People living with cancer and self-isolated at home were invited to fill in the survey via social groups. Data about socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, opinion on the impact of SARS-CoV-2, access to cancer care, behavioural measures implemented, and the perception of being isolated (ISOLA scale) were collected. Result(s): Participants were 195 adults living with cancer (female=76%, mean age=50.3+/-11.2 years). They were more often affected by haematological malignancy (51.3%) and staying at home with partner and children (38.5%) for more than 4 weeks (70.8%). Only 54% of them believed to be at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and 51% for severe complications. Measures to prevent the infection included hand washing (95.2%), social distancing (81.5%), face mask (96.3%), gloves (55.6%), and remedies to boost their immune system (29%). Overall, 62% reported diminished/absent access to cancer care and 29% were afraid that their cancer was not under control. The mean scores of the ISOLA scale (range 1-5) were 2.64 (SD=0.81) for isolation-related suffering, 3.31 (SD=1.13) for problems in the relationship with others, and 3.14 (SD=1.06) for difficulties in the relationship with oneself. Greater social isolation in quarantine was reported by the older patients, with lower education, and living without children. Conclusion(s): In the context of grave threats to their physical and mental health, people living with cancer need help from nurses to prioritise their health, cope with isolation-related suffering, and identify effective preventive behaviours.

Bladder cancer, on the contrary, is a well-known disease burdened by a high rate of affected patients and risk of recurrence, progression and death. SUMMARY: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) often involves mild clinical symptoms but in some cases, it can lead to pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction. Factors associated with developing a more severe disease are increased age, obesity, smoking and chronic underlying comorbidities (including diabetes mellitus). High-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) progression and worse prognosis are also characterized by a higher incidence in patients with risk factors similar to COVID-19. Immune system response and inflammation have been found as a common hallmark of both diseases. Most severe cases of COVID-19 and high-risk NMIBC patients at higher recurrence and progression risk are characterized by innate and adaptive immune activation followed by inflammation and cytokine/chemokine storm (interleukin [IL]-2, IL-6, IL-8). Alterations in neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets accompany the systemic inflammatory response to cancer and infections. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio for example have been recognized as factors related to poor prognosis for many solid tumors, including bladder cancer, and their role has been found important even for the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. KEY MESSAGES: All these mechanisms should be further analyzed in order to find new therapeutic agents and new strategies to block infection and cancer progression. Further than commonly used therapies, controlling cytokine production and inflammatory response is a promising field.","Busetto, Gian Maria; Porreca, Angelo; Del Giudice, Francesco; Maggi, Martina; D'Agostino, Daniele; Romagnoli, Daniele; Musi, Gennaro; Lucarelli, Giuseppe; Palmer, Katie; Colonna di Paliano, Ascanio; Muto, Matteo; Hurle, Rodolfo; Terracciano, Daniela; de Cobelli, Ottavio; Sciarra, Alessandro; De Berardinis, Ettore; Ferro, Matteo",Urol Int,100,16

Coincidently, the receptor-binding domain (RBD, residues 318–510) of SAR-CoV S protein is a major antigenic site to induce neutralizing antibodies. Here, we used RBD-Fc, a fusion protein containing the RBD and human IgG1 Fc, as a model in the studies and found that a single amino acid substitution in the RBD (R441A) could abolish the immunogenicity of RBD to induce neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice and rabbits. With a panel of anti-RBD mAbs as probes, we observed that R441A substitution was able to disrupt the majority of neutralizing epitopes in the RBD, suggesting that this residue is critical for the antigenic structure responsible for inducing protective immune responses. We also demonstrated that the RBD-Fc bearing R441A mutation could not bind to soluble and cell-associated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor for SARS-CoV and failed to block S protein-mediated pseudovirus entry, indicating that this point mutation also disrupted the receptor-binding motif (RBM) in the RBD. Taken together, these data provide direct evidence to show that a single amino acid residue at key position in the RBD can determine the major function of SARS-CoV S protein and imply for designing SARS vaccines and therapeutics.","He, Yuxian; Li, Jingjing; Jiang, Shibo",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,100,18

The rate of rapid dissemination, magnitude of viral contagiousness, person to person transmission at an asymptomatic phase of illness pose a unique and dangerous challenge for all patients, including neonatal and obstetric patients. Although scientific understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, nature of transmission, and efficacy of mitigation strategies is growing, neither a cure or vaccine have been developed. While COVID-19 is primarily a disease of older patients, infection is now seen across all age demographics with reports of illness in pregnant patients and infants. Altered hormone status and predominance of Th-2 immune helper cells may result in increased predisposition to SARS-CoV-2. Case reports of pregnant patients demonstrate a clinical presentation comparable to non-pregnant adults, but evidence of vertical transmission to the fetus is controversial. Neonatal reports demonstrate an inconsistent and non-specific phenotype, and it is often difficult to separate COVID-19 from the underlying conditions of prematurity or bacterial infection. The development of international registries to enable risk profiling of COVID-19 positive pregnant mothers and/or their offspring may facilitate the development of enhanced mitigation strategies, medical treatments and effective vaccinations.","Elgin, T.G.; Fricke, E.M.; Hernandez Reyes, M.E.; Tsimis, M.E.; Leslein, N.S.; Thomas, B.A.; Sato, T.S.; McNamara, P.J.",Journal of neonatal-perinatal medicine,100,1

Methods and Results: Conserved regions in the haemagglutinin genes of avian influenza viruses subtype H5 served as targets for the primers and TaqMan‐MGB probe design. Concentrations of primers and probe were optimized to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the reactions. A plasmid containing the haemagglutinin gene was constructed and in vitro transcribed for a quantitative assay of copy numbers of the target gene. The results revealed that the optimal concentration of primers and probe was 640 and 480 nmol l(−1), respectively. The threshold of 100 copies of target molecules could be detected. The linear range for detection was determined as 10(2) to 10(8) molecules in reaction. Conclusions: It took less than 3 h to complete the detection from viral RNA extraction, with good sensitivity and repeatability.

Innate immune response at this point is crucial for managing the replication and early stage symptoms of virus infection. This study was aimed to evaluate the expression of pattern recognition receptors and cytokines in upper airway cells of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Methods: : Forty seven nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens from 25 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and 22 SARS-CoV-2 negative individuals were investigated for expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), NOD-like receptors family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), interleukin (IL) - 6, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and type-1 interferons (IFNs) by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: : Increased expression of TLR2, MDA5 and ACE2 was detected in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in comparison with controls. MDA5 expression was significantly higher in asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients than the patients with severe symptoms. The asymptomatic group showed significant induction of type 1 IFNs than the symptomatic group. Non-specific induction of TLR7 could be observed in nasopharyngeal (NP) cells irrespective of symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Interpretation & conclusions: : The findings suggest that increased MDA5 in NP cells of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive patients may subsequently induce type 1 IFNs to protect the individuals from further clinical severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A future prospective study in NPS of larger cohort needs to be performed to confirm our findings.","Mohanty, Madhu Chhanda; Varose, Swapnil Yashwant; Sawant, Unnati Prashant; Fernandes, Mevis Minin",Indian j. med. res,100,26

The serious game Vil Du?! was developed to help children open up about sexual experiences. Vil Du?! is a non-verbal communication game, which resembles a dress-up game, in which children can show the therapist what happened to them. The current study examined how and for which therapy components Vil Du?! was used by therapists. METHODS: We used a mixed-methods triangulation design. Therapists filled out online surveys about the use of Vil Du?! with 23 clients (M(age) = 11.38 years, SD = 3.96; 61 % female). We also conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 therapists. The data were analyzed in SPSS (quantitative) and Nvivo (qualitative) following the stepwise guidelines of Zhang and Wildemuth. RESULTS: Merged qualitative and quantitative data revealed that therapists acknowledged the usefulness of Vil Du?! mostly for the therapy components trauma narration and processing, and psycho-education about sexuality. In addition, Vil Du?! might be most useful for clients who have difficulty with disclosing sexual abuse experiences, due to limited verbal abilities or feelings of guilt, shame, avoidance, and tension. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations from this study were incorporated in a user manual as a first step toward more systematic and broad implementation of Vil Du?! in the treatment of young sexual abuse victims. A next step is to test whether implementing Vil Du?! in therapy is effective in reducing the negative mental health consequences of sexual abuse for children and adolescents.","Endendijk, Joyce J.; Tichelaar, Henny K.; Deen, Menno; Deković, Maja",Child Adolesc Psychiatry Ment Health,100,18

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor responsible for SARS-CoV-2 access to human cells, and ACE2 expression is increased in patients with diabetes and hypertension treated with ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. We hypothesize that an upregulation of ACE2 due to its non-enzymatic glycation could be considered, by changing the protein tertiary structure in terms of amino acid (mostly lysine) available to be glycated. In fact, in a single ACE2 molecule, 34 lysine residues are present in the extracellular portion, and at least one of these is co-involved in a fundamental hydrogen-bond interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). The worse outcome of COVID-19 in people with diabetes could be related to the non-enzymatic glycation that triggers the activity of ACE2. Moreover, DNA methylation of genes regulating islet beta-cell function, as well as in insulin resistance of peripheral tissues such as liver, muscle, and adipose tissue may be involved, as already demonstrated for cancer conditions. DNA methylation, besides being considered as a biomarker to predict the risk of obesity and T2D, has been suggested also as a target for dietary and pharmacological treatments. The present observations may suggest further interventions in order to improve the outcome of COVID-19 in people affected by diabetes.","Sartore, Giovanni; Ragazzi, Eugenio; Faccin, Luca; Lapolla, Annunziata",Med Hypotheses,100,16

Method: A sample of 2,722 Slovene adults, aged from 18 to 82 years filled in the Big Five Inventory, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Mental Health Continuum. A path analysis with the Bootstrap estimation procedure was performed to evaluate the mediating effect of resilience in the relationship between personality and psychological functioning. Results: Resilience fully or partially mediated the relationships between all the Big Five but extraversion with subjective well-being and stress experienced at the beginning of the COVID-19 outburst. Neuroticism was the strongest predictor of less adaptive psychological functioning both directly and through diminished resilience.

Short of a truly effective preventive or curative vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, it is becoming increasingly clear that multiple pathophysiologic processes seen with COVID-19 as well as SARS-CoV-2 itself should be targeted. Because alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) embraces a panoply of biologic activities that may antagonize several pathophysiologic mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2, we hypothesize that this naturally occurring molecule is a promising agent to ameliorate COVID-19. We posit at least seven different mechanisms by which AAT may alleviate COVID-19. First, AAT is a serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) shown to inhibit TMPRSS-2, the host serine protease that cleaves the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, a necessary preparatory step for the virus to bind its cell surface receptor ACE2 to gain intracellular entry. Second, AAT has anti-viral activity against other RNA viruses HIV and influenza as well as induces autophagy, a known host effector mechanism against MERS-CoV, a related coronavirus that causes the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Third, AAT has potent anti-inflammatory properties, in part through inhibiting both nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) activation and ADAM17 (also known as tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme), and thus may dampen the hyper-inflammatory response of COVID-19. Fourth, AAT inhibits neutrophil elastase, a serine protease that helps recruit potentially injurious neutrophils and implicated in acute lung injury. AAT inhibition of ADAM17 also prevents shedding of ACE2 and hence may preserve ACE2 inhibition of bradykinin, reducing the ability of bradykinin to cause a capillary leak in COVID-19. Fifth, AAT inhibits thrombin, and venous thromboembolism and in situ microthrombi and macrothrombi are increasingly implicated in COVID-19. Sixth, AAT inhibition of elastase can antagonize the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a complex extracellular structure comprised of neutrophil-derived DNA, histones, and proteases, and implicated in the immunothrombosis of COVID-19; indeed, AAT has been shown to change the shape and adherence of non-COVID-19-related NETs. Seventh, AAT inhibition of endothelial cell apoptosis may limit the endothelial injury linked to severe COVID-19-associated acute lung injury, multi-organ dysfunction, and pre-eclampsia-like syndrome seen in gravid women. Furthermore, because both NETs formation and the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies are increased in both COVID-19 and non-COVID pre-eclampsia, it suggests a similar vascular pathogenesis in both disorders. As a final point, AAT has an excellent safety profile when administered to patients with AAT deficiency and is dosed intravenously once weekly but also comes in an inhaled preparation. Thus, AAT is an appealing drug candidate to treat COVID-19 and should be studied.","Bai, Xiyuan; Hippensteel, Joseph; Leavitt, Alida; Maloney, James P.; Beckham, David; Garcia, Cindy; Li, Qing; Freed, Brian M.; Ordway, Diane; Sandhaus, Robert A.; Chan, Edward D.",Med Hypotheses,100,23

Here, I synthesize the latest knowledge in wetland restoration based on revegetation with hydrophytes and stress common challenges and potential solutions. The review mainly focusses on natural wetlands but also includes information about naturalized constructed wetlands, which nowadays are being used not only to improve water quality but also to increase biodiversity. Available publications, peer-reviewed and any public domain, from the last 20 years, were reviewed. Several countries developed pilot case-studies and field-scale projects with more or less success, the large-scale ones being less frequent. Using floating species is less generalized than submerged species. Sediment transfer is more adequate for temporary wetlands. Hydrophyte revegetation as a restoration tool could be improved by selecting suitable wetlands, increasing focus on species biology and ecology, choosing the suitable propagation and revegetation techniques (seeding, planting). The clear negative factors which prevent the revegetation success (herbivory, microalgae, filamentous green algae, water and sediment composition) have to be considered. Policy-making and wetland restoration practices must more effectively integrate the information already known, particularly under future climatic scenarios.","Rodrigo, Maria A.",Plants (Basel),100,7

The mechanism of recombination in RNA viruses is template switching. Coronavirus transcription also involves template switching at specific regions, called transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). It is hypothesized but not yet verified that TRS sites are prone to recombination events. Here, we developed a tool called SuPER to systematically identify TRS in coronavirus genomes and then investigated whether recombination is more common at TRS. We ran SuPER on 506 coronavirus genomes and identified 465 TRS-L and 3509 TRS-B. We found that the TRS-L core sequence (CS) and the secondary structure of the leader sequence are generally conserved within coronavirus genera but different between genera. By examining the location of recombination breakpoints with respect to TRS-B CS, we observed that recombination hotspots are more frequently co-located with TRS-B sites than expected.","Yang, Yiyan; Yan, Wei; Hall, A Brantley; Jiang, Xiaofang",Mol Biol Evol,100,1

However, about 15 % of patients progress to severe stages and 2.5% of these patients succumb to this illness. Most patients with severe disease belong to the elderly age group (< 65 years of age) and have multiple associated co-morbidities. The immune responses induced by the COVID 19 virus, during the incubation and non-severe stages, requires the early initiation of a specific adaptive immune response to eliminate the virus and prevent the progress to severe stages. In patients with a dysfunctional bridge adaptive immunity, the innate immune response becomes exaggerated due to the lack of feedback from the adaptive immune cells. The resultant cytokine storm is responsible for the severe lung injury leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome seen in COVID 19 patients. Mesenchymal stem cells are known to suppress overactive immune responses as well as bring about tissue regeneration and repair. This immuno-modulatory effect of MSCs could hold potential to manage a patient with severe symptoms of COVID 19 infection due to a dysfunctional adaptive immune system.","Rao US, Vishal; Thakur, Shalini; Rao, Jyothsna; Arakeri, Gururaj; Brennan, Peter A; Jadhav, Sachin; Suhail Sayeed, Mufti; Rao, Gururaj",Med Hypotheses,100,1

Data on the effect of COVID-19 in pregnancy are limited to small case series. Objectives To evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes in pregnancy and the vertical transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Study Desigh Clinical records were retrospectively reviewed for 116 pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia from 25 hospitals in China between January 20 and March 24, 2020. Evidence of vertical transmission was assessed by testing for SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal pharyngeal swab samples. Results The median gestational age on admission was 38+0 (IQR 36+0-39+1) weeks. The most common symptoms were fever (50.9%, 59/116) and cough (28.4%, 33/116); 23.3% (27/116) patients presented without symptoms. Abnormal radiologic findings were found in 96.3% (104/108) of cases. There were eight cases (6.9%, 8/116) of severe pneumonia but no maternal deaths. One of eight patients (1/8) that presented in the first- and early-second-trimester had a missed spontaneous abortion. Twenty-one of 99 patients (21.2%, 21/99) that had delivered had preterm birth, including six with preterm premature ruptured of membranes. The rate of spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks was 6.1% (6/99). There was one case of severe neonatal asphyxia that resulted in neonatal death. Eighty-six of the 100 neonates that had testing for SARS-CoV-2 had negative results, of these ten neonates had paired amniotic fluid and cord blood samples that were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and spontaneous preterm birth. There is no evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection when the infection manifests during the third-trimester of pregnancy.","Yan, Jie; Guo, Juanjuan; Fan, Cuifang; Juan, Juan; Yu, Xuechen; Li, Jiafu; Feng, Ling; Li, Chunyan; Chen, Huijun; Qiao, Yuan; Lei, Di; Wang, Chen; Xiong, Guoping; Xiao, Fengyi; He, Wencong; Pang, Qiumei; Hu, Xiaoling; Wang, Suqing; Chen, Dunjin; Zhang, Yuanzhen; Poon, Liona C.; Yang, Huixia",Am J Obstet Gynecol,100,26

Across the study period, number of stroke activations showed significant decline (p = 0.004, 95% CI 6.513 to − 2.287), as the number of COVID-19 cases increased exponentially, whilst proportion of activations receiving acute recanalization therapy remained stable (p = 0.519, 95% CI − 1.605 to 2.702). Amongst AIS patients that received acute recanalization therapy, early neurological outcomes in terms of change in median NIHSS at 24 h (-4 versus -4, p = 0.685) were largely similar between the pre- and during DORSCON orange periods. The number of stroke activations decreased while the proportion receiving acute recanalization therapy remained stable in the current COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore.

The aim of the present study was to assess the long-term effects of BS on chronic low-grade inflammation markers related to severe obesity. Moreover, the meaning of the type of BS procedure as well as the remission of type 2 diabetes (T2D) for inflammatory status up to 4 years after BS was analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study including 163 patients at baseline, inflammatory and metabolic parameters were assessed at 4 time points: before surgery (baseline), 6 months after surgery (visit 1), 2 years after surgery (visit 2), and 4 years after surgery (visit 3). Univariate regression analysis was used to identify variables that were thought to determine change in inflammatory parameters. RESULTS: CRP, hs-CRP, leucocytes, and ferritin significantly declined in the mid- and long-term according to the U-shaped curve of weight loss (p<0.001). Change in body mass index (BMI) at long-time follow-up showed a significant linear effect on change in leucocytes (B=0.082; p<0.001) and change in hs-CRP (B=0.03; p<0.05). There was a strong, positive correlation between T2D and hs-CRP at visit 2 (r(s)=0.195; p<0.05) and visit 3 (r(s)=0.36; p=0.001). With regard to type of surgery and gender, there were no significant differences in inflammatory parameters. CONCLUSION: BS is able to reduce obesity-related chronic low-grade inflammation up to 4 years after surgical intervention. The improvement in metaflammation is related to the change in BMI and remission of T2D in the long-term.

We hypothesized that GC7 could be useful for preconditioning kidneys from donors prior transplantation. Using a preclinical porcine brain-death (BD) donation model, we carried out in vivo evaluation of GC7 pre-treatment (3 mg/kg iv, 5 min after BD) at the beginning of the 4h-donor management, after which kidneys were collected, cold-stored (18h in UW) and one was allo-transplanted. Groups were defined as following (n=6 per group): healthy (CTL), untreated BD (Vehicle) and GC7-treated BD (Vehicule+GC7). At the end of 4h-management, GC7 treatment decreased BD-induced markers, as ROS markers. In addition, GC7 increased expression of mitochondrial-protective PGC1α and anti-oxidant proteins (SOD2, HO-1, NRF2 and Sirtuins). At the end of cold storage, GC7 treatment induced an increase of NRF2 and PGC1α mRNA and a better mitochondrial integrity/homeostasis with a decrease of DRP1-activation and increase of MFN2. Moreover, GC7 treatment significantly improved kidney outcome during 90 days follow-up after transplantation (fewer creatininemia and fibrosis). Overall, GC7 treatment was shown to be protective for kidneys against BD-induced injuries during donor management and subsequently appeared to preserve antioxidant defences and mitochondria homeostasis; these protective effects being accompanied by a better transplantation outcome.","Giraud, Sebastien; Kerforne, Thomas; Zely, Jeremy; Ameteau, Virginie; Couturier, Pierre; Tauc, Michel; Hauet, Thierry",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,100,1

PURPOSE: To evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether use of ACEIs or ARBs either increases risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or is associated with worse COVID-19 disease outcomes, and to assess the efficacy of these medications for COVID-19 treatment. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (Ovid) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2003 to 4 May 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance for 1 year; the World Health Organization database of COVID-19 publications and medRxiv.org through 17 April 2020; and ClinicalTrials.gov to 24 April 2020, with planned ongoing surveillance. STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies and trials in adults that examined associations and effects of ACEIs or ARBs on risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. DATA EXTRACTION: Single-reviewer abstraction confirmed by another reviewer, independent evaluation by 2 reviewers of study quality, and collective assessment of certainty of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two retrospective cohort studies found that ACEI and ARB use was not associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, and 1 case–control study found no association with COVID-19 illness in a large community (moderate-certainty evidence). Fourteen observational studies, involving a total of 23 565 adults with COVID-19, showed consistent evidence that neither medication was associated with more severe COVID-19 illness (high-certainty evidence). Four registered randomized trials plan to evaluate ACEIs and ARBs for treatment of COVID-19. LIMITATION: Half the studies were small and did not adjust for important confounding variables. CONCLUSION: High-certainty evidence suggests that ACEI or ARB use is not associated with more severe COVID-19 disease, and moderate-certainty evidence suggests no association between use of these medications and positive SARS-CoV-2 test results among symptomatic patients. Whether these medications increase the risk for mild or asymptomatic disease or are beneficial in COVID-19 treatment remains uncertain. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.

The present study aims to investigate fluctuations in depression and anxiety using the COVID-19 pandemic as a model crisis. A total of 1512 adults living in the United States enrolled in this online study beginning April 2, 2020 and were assessed weekly for 10 weeks (until June 4, 2020). We measured depression and anxiety using the Zung Self-Rating Depression scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (state subscale), respectively, along with demographic and COVID-related surveys. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine factors contributing to longitudinal changes in depression and anxiety. We found that depression and anxiety levels were high in early April, but declined over time. Being female, younger age, lower-income, and previous psychiatric diagnosis correlated with higher overall levels of anxiety and depression; being married additionally correlated with lower overall levels of depression, but not anxiety. Importantly, worsening of COVID-related economic impact and increase in projected pandemic duration exacerbated both depression and anxiety over time. Finally, increasing levels of informedness correlated with decreasing levels of depression, while increased COVID-19 severity (i.e., 7-day change in cases) and social media use were positively associated with anxiety over time. These findings not only provide evidence for overall emotional adaptation during the initial weeks of the pandemic, but also provide insight into overlapping, yet distinct, factors contributing to depression and anxiety throughout the first wave of the pandemic.","Shuster, Anastasia; O’Brien, Madeline; Luo, Yi; Berner, Laura A.; Perl, Ofer; Heflin, Matthew; Kulkarni, Kaustubh; Chung, Dongil; Na, Soojung; Fiore, Vincenzo G.; Gu, Xiaosi",Transl Psychiatry,100,26

Although nurses are indispensable healthcare professionals, programs to develop nurses with global health competencies and relevant studies are rare. Accordingly, this study was designed to develop a program to increase global health competencies and global leadership in nursing students and test its effect. Methods: A single group pre- and post-test study design was used. A 13-weeks program was developed and implemented with 204 students. Data were analyzed using paired t-test. The program to promote global health competencies was designed to improve nursing students' knowledge of global health, global leadership, global health competencies, critical thinking ability, and student-student partnership. Results: Global health competencies (t = −19.96, p < 0.001), self-assessed global leadership (t = −7.67, p < 0.001), and critical thinking ability (t = −7.67, p < 0.001) all significantly increased. Discussion: The study findings of increased global health competencies and global leadership in nursing students after participation in the program indicated ways in which global health competencies of nurses need to be developed. Therefore, the following aspects should be considered. First, nursing educators should understand the need and importance of global health education and accordingly, current nursing curriculums should be revised to include courses about global health. A systematic course of studies about global health should be developed and implemented based on discussions among experts and researchers. Second, as future health care professionals, nursing students should take an interest in global health problems and recognize various issues that need to be solved beyond borders between countries. To develop global health competencies, various efforts and systematic curriculum revisions are necessary.","Hwang, Won Ju; Jo, Hyun Hee",Front Public Health,100,1

The purpose of this study was to better understand the challenges experienced and strategies utilized by Australian athletes (n = 7) and coaches (n = 5) preparing for the Tokyo Paralympic Games using semi-structured interviews. The thematic analysis highlighted challenges specific to participants’ sport (e.g., budgetary constraints, decentralized experiences, athletes with various impairments), personal life (e.g., moving cities to access coaching, postponing vocational/educational developments, isolation from social circles), and associated uncertainties (e.g., COVID-19, qualifications, accreditations). Participants managed these challenges by utilizing strategies to ‘anticipate and prepare’ (e.g., detailed planning, effective communication, contingency plans) and ‘manage expectations’ (e.g., understanding specific roles and boundaries, focusing on the process [i.e., effort over results]). Trust and communication between athletes and coaches was key in coaches’ better understanding of how athletes’ impairments interact with their training and competition environments and tailor support to each athlete’s unique needs. Last, participants reflected on the ‘pressure’ of the Games due to their performance having an impact on their career trajectory ‘post-Tokyo’ with some athletes contemplating retirement and others realizing the consequences of their performance on sport-related vocation and sponsorship. Coaches also accepted the success of their programs and job security will depend on outcomes at the Games. The findings from this study shed light on factors to consider to reduce challenges for teams preparing for major competitions but also highlight key practical implications to support athletes and coaches leading up, during, and post-major Games.","Dehghansai, N.; Pinder, R.

Launched as part of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (Act-A) in June 2020, COVAX suggested to serve as a vaccine buyers’ and distribution club for countries around the world. It also aimed to support the pharmaceutical industry in speeding up and broadening vaccine development. While COVAX has recently come under critique for failing to bring about global vaccine equity, influential politicians and public health advocates insist that future iterations of it will improve pandemic preparedness. So far COVAX’s role in the ongoing financialization of global health, i.e. in the rise of financial concepts, motives, practices and institutions has not been analyzed. METHODS: This article describes and critically assesses COVAX’s financial logics, i.e. the concepts, arguments and financing flows on which COVAX relies. It is based on a review of over 109 COVAX related reports, ten in-depth interviews with global health experts working either in or with COVAX, as well as participant observation in 18 webinars and online meetings concerned with global pandemic financing, between September 2020 and August 2021. RESULTS: The article finds that COVAX expands the scale and scope of financial instruments in global health governance, and that this is done by conflating different understandings of risk. Specifically, COVAX conflates public health risk and corporate financial risk, leading it to privilege concerns of pharmaceutical companies over those of most participating countries – especially low and lower-middle income countries (LICs and LMICs). COVAX thus drives the financialization of global health and ends up constituting a risk itself - that of perpetuating the downsides of financialization (e.g. heightened inequality, secrecy, complexity in governance, an ineffective and slow use of aid), whilst insufficiently realising its potential benefits (pandemic risk reduction, increased public access to emergency funding, indirect price control over essential goods and services). CONCLUSION: Future iterations of vaccine buyers’ and distribution clubs as well as public vaccine development efforts should work towards reducing all aspects of public health risk rather than privileging its corporate financial aspects. This will include reassessing the interplay of aid and corporate subsidies in global health.","Stein, Felix",Global Health,100,23

The nature of the coronavirus genome is nonsegmented, single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA. Its size ranges from 27 to 32 kb, which is significantly larger when compared with other RNA viruses. The gene encoding the large surface glycoprotein is up to 4.4 kb, encoding an imposing trimeric, highly glycosylated protein. This soars some 20 nm above the virion envelope, giving the virus the appearance-with a little imagination-of a crown or coronet. Coronavirus research has contributed to the understanding of many aspects of molecular biology in general, such as the mechanism of RNA synthesis, translational control, and protein transport and processing.

We aimed to describe the diagnosed COVID-19 cases and to estimate the symptomatic and asymptomatic suspected cases among individuals with pre-existing myocardial infarction myocardial infarction and their relatives in lockdown period. Methods: We conducted a two-week cross-sectional telephone survey, from May 4 to May 15, 2020, including all households with at least one individual with pre-existing cardiovascular disease in the past two years. We defined a suspected COVID-19 case when living with at least one individual tested positive to COVID-19, or when an individual has been in contact with a suspected or confirmed case since the March 1rst, or when a relative from the same house has been hospitalized or deceased for COVID-19. Results: We observed high rates of compliance with health measures during the lockdown period, regardless of age or risk factors. Among individuals with myocardial infarction history, two were COVID-19 confirmed, 13.37% were suspected (94/703) of whom 70.21% (66/94) asymptomatic. Conclusions: Individuals with myocardial infarction history presented different symptoms association with more respiratory signs.

In 2003, after nucleic acid genotyping, a new virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). After nine years, another coronavirus emerged in the middle east and was named MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome—Coronavirus). Finally, in December 2019, a new unknown coronavirus was isolated from a cluster of patients and was named SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019). This review aims to propose a complete overview of autopsy in the three coronaviruses over the past two decades, showing its pivotal role in the management of unknown diseases. A total of 116 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 14 studies were collected concerning SARS-CoV (87 autopsy reports, from Asian and American countries), 2 studies for MERS-CoV (2 autopsy reports, from Middle-East Asian countries), and 100 studies on SARS-CoV-2 (930 autopsy reports). Analyzing the data obtained on COVID-19, based on the country criterion, a large number of post-mortem investigation were performed in European countries (580 reports), followed by American countries (251 reports). It is interesting to note that no data were found from the Oceanic countries, maybe because of the minor involvement of the outbreak. In all cases, autopsy provided much information about each unknown coronavirus. Despite advanced technologies in the diagnostic fields, to date, autopsy remains the gold standard method to understand the biological features and the pathogenesis of unknown infections, especially when awareness of a pathogen is restricted and the impact on the healthcare system is substantial. The knowledge gained through this technique may positively influence therapeutic strategies, ultimately reducing mortality.","Sessa, Francesco; Salerno, Monica; Pomara, Cristoforo",Medicina (Kaunas),100,22

RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence rate of anxiety among women was 36.77%, and some adaptation of behavior was observed. Logistic regression analysis showed that pregnant women who had an annual household income of less than $7,000, were primiparous, went out for prenatal examination, wanted to self-monitor during pregnancy but did not know how to do it, believed that they should be strictly isolated at home and cancel prenatal examinations, and expected to receive pregnancy healthcare through teleconsultation services showed a higher risk of anxiety. Nevertheless, pregnant Zhuang women who were 22–35 years old, undergraduate-educated, and in their second trimester were less likely to suffer from anxiety. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant psychological impact on pregnant women from ethnic minorities. Factors related to quarantine and social isolation policies appear to drive changes in behaviors and anxiety disorders. Multidisciplinary mental health services and culturally sensitive interventions are necessary for minority pregnant women, especially for low-income primiparous women in the first or third trimester.","Ge, Yuan; Shi, Chunhong; Wu, Bin; Liu, Yannan; Chen, Ling; Deng, Yuegui",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,100,1

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective survey study. METHODS: This study used an online questionnaire about the effects of face masks on daily life communication of adult CI users. The questionnaire consists of three parts: (a) A face mask questionnaire, (b) loneliness question (c) three subdomains of the Nijmegen Cochlear Implant Questionnaire to assess quality of life. The questionnaires were send out on October 20, 2020. Four hundred and seven adult CI users were invited to participate in the study. The survey inclusion was closed on November 5, 2020. The study setting was the Rotterdam Cochlear Implant Center, Erasmus MC, a tertiary referral center in The Netherlands. The loneliness question and Nijmegen Cochlear Implant Questionnaire were analyzed for possible differences between the current situation with masks and the situation before, when masks were not commonly used. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty one adult CI users (54% female, mean age 62 years) participated in the study. The face mask questionnaire showed that face masks cause considerable problems in daily life communication of 80% of the participants. Also, CI users tend to feel more lonely and all used subdomains of the Nijmegen Cochlear Implant Questionnaire worsened due to the use of face masks. CONCLUSION: The widespread use of face masks greatly complicates the daily life communication of CI users and reduces quality of life.

The organizational framework of offering employer-sponsored mindfulness programming to HCPs sets the stage for an orchestrated, mindful response to COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This single arm pre-post interventional research tested changes in measures of burnout, resilience, perceived stress and work engagement for interprofessional HCP faculty and students participating in Mindfulness in Motion (MIM), a novel eight-week multimodal evidenced–based onsite intervention. METHODS: A Graduate Medical Education (GME) pilot of MIM was expanded to target inter-professional resiliency within an academic health center. MIM is the core offering of the Gabbe Health and Wellness program for students, staff, faculty, and residents and is embedded across the entire medical center. RESULTS: The faculty/student role demographic categories (n = 267) included resident physicians, resident chaplains, attending physicians, medical center faculty, and hospital administrative/managerial clinical staff. These cohorts demonstrated significant 27% reduction in participants meeting burnout criteria. Total burnout was determined by scores on subscales of emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and personal accomplishment (PA) of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). There was a highly significant pre/post decrease in the in the emotional exhaustion (p < 0.00001) and depersonalization scores (p < 0.001), with highly significant increase in the personal accomplishment (p < 0.00001) scores. Resilience, as measured by the Connor Davidson Resiliency Scale (CDRS), significantly increased (p < 0.00001), alongside a significant increase (p < 0.00001) in the total Utrecht Work Engagement Score (UWES) and a significant decrease in scores on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (p < 0.00001). CONCLUSION: MIM significantly reduced burnout and perceived stress, for interprofessional (HCP) faculty and staff, while increasing resilience and work engagement in a large healthcare system.

Upon stimulation, the inflammasomes activate the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 and induce gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis. Dysregulated inflammasome signaling could lead to hyperinflammation in response to environmental triggers, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of childhood autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases. In this review, we group childhood rheumatic diseases into the autoinflammation to autoimmunity spectrum and discuss about the involvement of inflammasomes in disease mechanisms. Genetic mutations in inflammasome components cause monogenic autoinflammatory diseases, while inflammasome-related genetic variants have been implicated in polygenic childhood rheumatic diseases. We highlight the reported associations of inflammasome signaling-related genetic polymorphisms/protein levels with pediatric autoimmune disease susceptibility and disease course. Furthermore, we discuss about the use of IL-1 receptor antagonist as an adjunctive therapy in several childhood autoimmune diseases, including macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) related to COVID-19. A comprehensive multi-cohort comparison on inflammasome gene expression profile in different pediatric rheumatic diseases is needed to identify patient subsets that might benefit from the adjunctive therapy of IL-1β inhibitors.","Yang, Chin-An; Chiang, Bor-Luen",Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,100,3

METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional study conducted during the peak of COVID-19 in Pakistan between May and June, 2020 comprised of 2307 Pakistani male and female participants. Subjects under 18 years of age and nationality other than Pakistani were excluded. An online questionnaire was administered via the Internet using various kinds of social media. RESULTS: The study was comprised of 2307 male and female participants; 2074 (89.90%) used SM for seeking COVID-19 information, 450 (20%) used both Facebook (FB) and WhatsApp (WA), and 267 (11.6%) used FB, WA, Twitter, and Instagram. Respondents’ perceptions showed that: 529 (23%) believed in SM information and 1564 (67.8%) stated that COVID-19 affected their social and mental wellbeing. Respondents’ knowledge revealed that: 1509 (65.40%) had poor knowledge (≤ 50% score), and 798 (34.6%) had good knowledge (> 50% score) (P < 0.001) about COVID-19.

International drug trial guidelines recommend trialists review plans for handling missing data in the conduct and statistical analysis, but clear recommendations are lacking. METHODS We present a four-step strategy for handling missing outcome data in the analysis of randomised trials that are ongoing during a pandemic. We consider handling missing data arising due to (i) participant infection, (ii) treatment disruptions and (iii) loss to follow-up. We consider both settings where treatment effects for a 'pandemic-free world' and 'world including a pandemic' are of interest. RESULTS In any trial, investigators should; (1) Clarify the treatment estimand of interest with respect to the occurrence of the pandemic; (2) Establish what data are missing for the chosen estimand; (3) Perform primary analysis under the most plausible missing data assumptions followed by; (4) Sensitivity analysis under alternative plausible assumptions. To obtain an estimate of the treatment effect in a 'pandemic-free world', participant data that are clinically affected by the pandemic (directly due to infection or indirectly via treatment disruptions) are not relevant and can be set to missing. For primary analysis, a missing-at-random assumption that conditions on all observed data that are expected to be associated with both the outcome and missingness may be most plausible. For the treatment effect in the 'world including a pandemic', all participant data is relevant and should be included in the analysis. For primary analysis, a missing-at-random assumption - potentially incorporating a pandemic time-period indicator and participant infection status - or a missing-not-at-random assumption with a poorer response may be most relevant, depending on the setting. In all scenarios, sensitivity analysis under credible missing-not-at-random assumptions should be used to evaluate the robustness of results. We highlight controlled multiple imputation as an accessible tool for conducting sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS Missing data problems will be exacerbated for trials active during the Covid-19 pandemic. This four-step strategy will facilitate clear thinking about the appropriate analysis for relevant questions of interest.","Cro, Suzie; Morris, Tim P; Kahan, Brennan C; Cornelius, Victoria R; Carpenter, James R",BMC medical research methodology,100,5

One of the major challenges of this disease is the high number of patients needing advanced respiratory support due to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as the lung is the major –although not exclusive- target of the virus. The molecular mechanisms, pathogenic drivers and the target cell type(s) in SARS-CoV-2 infection are still poorly understood, but the development of a “hyperactive” immune response is proposed to play a role in the evolution of the disease and it is envisioned as a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Here we propose a theory by which the main targets for SARS-CoV-2 are the Type II Alveolar Epithelial Cells and the clinical manifestations of the syndrome are a direct consequence of their involvement. We propose the existence of a vicious cycle by which once alveolar damage starts in AEC II cells, the inflammatory state is supported by macrophage pro-inflammatory polarization (M1), cytokines release and by the activation of the NF-κB pathway. If this theory is confirmed, future therapeutic efforts can be directed to target Type 2 alveolar cells and the molecular pathogenic drivers associated with their dysfunction with currently available therapeutic strategies.","Carcaterra, M.; Caruso, C.",Med Hypotheses,100,1

This outbreak not only affected healthcare systems but the resultant economic losses were also enormous. COVID-19 has demanded that the health care systems globally evolve, develop new strategies, identify new models of functioning, and at times, fall back on the old conservative methods of orthopedic care to decrease the risk of disease transmission. Although, the majority of hospitals are refraining from performing elective surgeries, emergent and urgent procedures cannot be delayed. Various strategies have been developed at the institute level to reduce the risk of infection transmission among the theatre team from an unsuspected patient (asymptomatic and presymptomatic) during the perioperative period. Material and methods The present study is a part of an ongoing project which is being conducted in a tertiary level hospital after obtaining research review board approval. All patients admitted either for vertebral fracture or spinal cord compression from February 2020 to May 2020 were included. The present study included 13 patients (nine males and four females) with an average age of 35.4 years The oldest patient was of 63 years which is considered a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19 infection. Results Eight patients (61.5%) presented with spinal cord injury (SCI) due to vertebral fracture with fall from height (87.5%) as the most common etiology. Among the traumatic SCI patients, six (75%) were managed surgically with posterior decompression and instrumented fusion with pedicle screws while two patients (25%) were managed conservatively. There were four patients (30.8%) of tuberculosis of the spine of whom two (50%) were managed with posterior decompression, debridement, and stabilization with pedicle screws, samples for culture, biopsy, and cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) were collected during the procedure; for the remaining two patients (50%), a trans-pedicular biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis for initiation of anti-tubercular therapy. Prolapsed intervertebral disc causing cauda equina syndrome was the reason for emergency surgery in one patient (7.7%). COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was performed in four patients (30.8%), in whom the most common symptom was fever (two patients (50%)). These patients were residents of high prevalence area for COVID-19 infection. Sore throat (25%), fatigue (25%), and low oxygen saturation (25%) were present in one patient which prompted us to get the COVID-19 test. All patients were reported negative for COVID-19. Conclusion The structural organization and the management protocol we describe allowed us to reduce infection risk and ultimately hospital stay, thereby maximizing the already stretched available medical resources. These precautions helped us to reduce transmission and exposure to COVID-19 in health care workers (HCW) and patients in our institute. The aim of this article is that our early experience can be of value to the medical communities that will soon be in a similar situation.","Verma, Virendra; Nagar, Manoj; Jain, Vaibhav; Santoshi, John A; Dwivedi, Manish; Behera, Prateek; Selvanayagam, Rajkumar; Pal, Dharm; Singh, Kuldeep",Cureus,100,1

The awareness of COVID-19 and wellness among Thai health professional students, such as medical, physical therapy, nursing, pharmacy, and medical technology students were surveyed during the early “new normal” informing policy. The participants included 1,001 students, aged 17 to 25 years old, who responded to a Google form questionnaire set by request. The results showed that the prominent health risks among the Thai health professional students included sedentary behavior, obesity, and mental symptoms. A positive rating in attitude towards the COVID-19 epidemic was mostly observed.

RESULTS: Most hematological and biochemical indexes of patients with COVID‐19 were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be predictive of a diagnosis of COVID‐19. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.87 and hemoglobin with an AUC of 0.81. Red blood cell, albumin, eosinophil, hematocrit, alkaline phosphatase, and mean platelet volume had fair discriminatory ability. Combinations of any two parameters performed better than did the RDW alone. CONCLUSIONS: Routine laboratory examinations may be helpful for the diagnosis of COVID‐19. Application of laboratory tests may help to optimize the use of isolation rooms for patients when they present with unexplained febrile respiratory illnesses.","Pan, Yunbao; Ye, Guangming; Zeng, Xiantao; Liu, Guohong; Zeng, Xiaojiao; Jiang, Xianghu; Zhao, Jin; Chen, Liangjun; Guo, Shuang; Deng, Qiaoling; Hong, Xiaoyue; Yang, Ying; Li, Yirong; Wang, Xinghuan",Clin Transl Med,100,1
