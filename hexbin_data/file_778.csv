The IHR name the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) as one of the international organisations with whom the WHO must cooperate and co-ordinate in implementing the IHR. It was organisations like the IFRC and MSF, that worked to stop the spread of Ebola following the outbreak in 2014. The focus of this chapter is the work of the IFRC during the Ebola outbreak. The IFRC carries out relief operations to assist victims of disasters, and combines this with development work to strengthen the capacities of its member National Societies. The IFRC’s work focuses on four core areas: promoting humanitarian values, disaster response, disaster preparedness, and health and community care. Combining a study of the IFRC as an organisation with a legal mandate of its own, elucidated in the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and the more general international legal framework, this chapter uses international law as a framework to reflect on the limits and effectiveness of legal measures in responding to Ebola. To this end, international law provides a logical and global method to respond to infectious diseases. This chapter finds that the mandate and practice of the IFRC in the response to Ebola provides material to critically analyse each of these parts in light of infectious disease proliferation in 2014–2016. Since outbreak was announced in early 2014 more than 10,000 Red Cross volunteers were trained in Ebola response. IFRC supported emergency operations in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have targeted 23 million people.","Shucksmith-Wesley, Christy",Infectious Diseases in the New Millennium,778,4

Indonesia’s sovereignty claims conflicted with the decades-long practice of sharing influenza samples with the WHO, and was seen as an affront to scientific norms of cooperation and openness. The conflict was ostensibly resolved in 2011 with the introduction of the WHO’s Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (PIP Framework), which was intended to secure access to influenza viruses from around the world and effect a fairer distribution of vaccines and other benefits associated with the use of pandemic influenza samples. The problem is, the PIP Framework did not resolve the issues created with the concept of viral sovereignty. In fact, by recognising the sovereign rights of states over this subset of pathogens, the PIP Framework legitimised viral sovereignty as a broader legal norm. Instead of resisting this concept, the WHO quietly acceded to it and reinforced a set of perverse incentives for countries to restrict access to pathogens precisely when those pathogens embody the greatest value: during a public health emergency. This chapter demonstrates that the concept of viral sovereignty did not begin with Indonesia in 2007, and more importantly, it did not end with the PIP Framework in 2011. Despite the term “viral sovereignty” fading into relative obscurity, the concept itself is now an established legal norm that could delay efforts to save lives during epidemics and pandemics.","Rourke, Michelle F.",Infectious Diseases in the New Millennium,778,4

Complex interactions amongst abnormality in epidermal barrier function, environment, infectious agents and immunological defects are considered as key factors in the pathogenesis of AD. Although the role of oxidative stress has been studied in some skin diseases, investigation of the same in AD is intermittent. Calcineurin inhibitors and/or topical corticosteroids are currently available; however, it causes atrophy of the skin, burning sensation, and systemic side effects which leads to poor patient compliance. These limitations provoke the strong need to develop an innovative approach in managing AD. Nanomaterials for effective drug delivery to skin conditions such as AD have attracted a lot of attention owing to its ability to encapsulate, protect, and release the cargo at the diseased skin site. However, there are lots of unmet challenges especially in terms of development of non-toxic formulations and clinical translation of established nanomedicines in the form of accessible products. Numerous formulations have emerged as carrier for poorly soluble and permeable drugs, viz., lipidic, polymeric, metal, silica, liposomes, hydrocarbon gels and this field is evolving. This review is intended to provide an insight incidences associated with pathophysiology of AD and challenges with existing treatments of AD. Focus is kept on reviewing current development and emerging nanomedicines for effective treatment of AD. The review also inculcates merits of several nanomedicines in overcoming challenges of existing products and its future implications.","Parekh, Khushali; Mehta, Tejal A; Dhas, Namdev; Kumar, Pavan; Popat, Amirali",AAPS PharmSciTech,778,1

The Thoracic Domain of the Asian Society for Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery reports a consensus statement on the provision of thoracic cancer surgery during this pandemic. METHODS A Thoracic Experts Panel was convened by the Society. A consensus on the provision, safety, and setting of thoracic cancer surgery during the pandemic was obtained through a Delphi process. RESULTS Responses were received from 26 panel members (96% response rate) from 10 regions across Asia. The Society recommended that elective thoracic cancer surgery services may need to be reduced or postponed if medical resources were needed for COVID-19 patients, especially intensive care unit beds and ventilators. However, thoracic cancer surgery should proceed as normal for all solid tumors, without restrictions based on disease stage, availability of non-surgical treatment options, or patient condition (unless there is a high likelihood of postoperative intensive care unit stay). Aerosol-forming procedures should be avoided intra- and perioperatively. The surgical approach does not make a difference in terms of safety. Services for thoracic cancer patients should be offered only in hospitals that maintain isolation wards for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS Services for patients with thoracic cancer should be maintained during the COVID-19 pandemic. The position of the Society is that thoracic surgeons have a responsibility to perform good surgical management of thoracic cancer during the pandemic, to advocate for patients' rights to receive it, and to safeguard patients and staff from infection.","Jheon, Sanghoon; Ahmed, Aneez Db; Fang, Vincent Wt; Jung, Woohyun; Khan, Ali Zamir; Lee, Jang-Ming; Sihoe, Alan Dl; Thongcharoen, Punnarerk; Tsuboi, Masahiro; Turna, Akif; Nakajima, Jun",Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals,778,16

However, alteplase also increases the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage; we aimed to determine the proportional and absolute effects of alteplase on the risks of intracerebral haemorrhage, mortality, and functional impairment in different types of patients. METHODS We used individual patient data from the Stroke Thrombolysis Trialists' (STT) meta-analysis of randomised trials of alteplase versus placebo (or untreated control) in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. We prespecified assessment of three classifications of intracerebral haemorrhage: type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage within 7 days; Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in Stroke Monitoring Study's (SITS-MOST) haemorrhage within 24-36 h (type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage with a deterioration of at least 4 points on National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]); and fatal intracerebral haemorrhage within 7 days. We used logistic regression, stratified by trial, to model the log odds of intracerebral haemorrhage on allocation to alteplase, treatment delay, age, and stroke severity. We did exploratory analyses to assess mortality after intracerebral haemorrhage and examine the absolute risks of intracerebral haemorrhage in the context of functional outcome at 90-180 days. FINDINGS Data were available from 6756 participants in the nine trials of intravenous alteplase versus control. Alteplase increased the odds of type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage (occurring in 231 [6·8%] of 3391 patients allocated alteplase vs 44 [1·3%] of 3365 patients allocated control; odds ratio [OR] 5·55 [95% CI 4·01-7·70]; absolute excess 5·5% [4·6-6·4]); of SITS-MOST haemorrhage (124 [3·7%] of 3391 vs 19 [0·6%] of 3365; OR 6·67 [4·11-10·84]; absolute excess 3·1% [2·4-3·8]); and of fatal intracerebral haemorrhage (91 [2·7%] of 3391 vs 13 [0·4%] of 3365; OR 7·14 [3·98-12·79]; absolute excess 2·3% [1·7-2·9]). However defined, the proportional increase in intracerebral haemorrhage was similar irrespective of treatment delay, age, or baseline stroke severity, but the absolute excess risk of intracerebral haemorrhage increased with increasing stroke severity: for SITS-MOST intracerebral haemorrhage the absolute excess risk ranged from 1·5% (0·8-2·6%) for strokes with NIHSS 0-4 to 3·7% (2·1-6·3%) for NIHSS 22 or more (p=0·0101). For patients treated within 4·5 h, the absolute increase in the proportion (6·8% [4·0% to 9·5%]) achieving a modified Rankin Scale of 0 or 1 (excellent outcome) exceeded the absolute increase in risk of fatal intracerebral haemorrhage (2·2% [1·5% to 3·0%]) and the increased risk of any death within 90 days (0·9% [-1·4% to 3·2%]). INTERPRETATION Among patients given alteplase, the net outcome is predicted both by time to treatment (with faster time increasing the proportion achieving an excellent outcome) and stroke severity (with a more severe stroke increasing the absolute risk of intracerebral haemorrhage). Although, within 4·5 h of stroke, the probability of achieving an excellent outcome with alteplase treatment exceeds the risk of death, early treatment is especially important for patients with severe stroke.

The illusion consists in a compelling and immediate experience that the space behind an occluding object in the foreground is empty. Although the illusion refers to a region of space, which is invisible due to occlusion (a blind spot), there is evidence to suggest that it is nevertheless driven by visual mechanisms and that it can be just as deceptive and powerful as ordinary visual illusions. We suggest that this novel illusion can make situations involving blind spots in a road user's field of view even more dangerous than one would expect based on the lack of visibility by itself. This could be because it erroneously makes the road user feel that (s)he has actually seen everything there is to see, and thus has verified that the blind spot is empty. This hypothesis requires further testing before definitive conclusions can be drawn, but we wish to make researchers and authorities involved in the analysis of traffic accidents and on-the-spot crash investigations aware of its potential role in order to encourage registration of relevant data and facilitate further research.","Ekroll, Vebjørn; Svalebjørg, Mats; Pirrone, Angelo; Böhm, Gisela; Jentschke, Sebastian; van Lier, Rob; Wagemans, Johan; Høye, Alena",Cognitive research: principles and implications,778,19

However, the safety and effectiveness of MSCs in the treatment of COVID-19-associated pneumonia patients need to be systematically reviewed and analyzed. Two independent researchers searched for the relevant studies published between October 2019 and April 2021 in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, WAN FANG, and CNKI databases. A total of 22 studies involving 371 patients were included in the present study. MSCs were administered in 247 participants, and MSCs were allogeneic from umbilical cord, adipose tissue, menstrual blood, placenta, Wharton's jelly, or unreported sources. Combined results found that MSCs group significantly reduced the incidence of adverse events (OR = 0.43, 95%CI. = 0.22~0.84, P = 0.01) and mortality (OR = 0.17, 95%CI. = 0.06~0.49, P < 0.01), and the difference compared with control group was statistically significant. No MSCs treat-related serious adverse events were reported. The lung function and radiographic outcomes, and biomarker levels of inflammation and immunity all showed improvement trends. Therefore, MSCs therapy is an effective and safe method in the treatment of COVID-19-associated pneumonia and shows advantages in less adverse events and mortality. However, a standard and effective MSCs treatment program needs to be developed.","Wang, J.; Shi, P.; Chen, D.; Wang, S.; Wang, P.; Feng, X.; Zhang, L.",,778,16

The mig gene is inducible in macrophages and in other cells in response to interferon (IFN)-gamma. We have transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with cDNA encoding human Mig and we have derived CHO cell lines from which we have purified recombinant human Mig (rHuMig). rHuMig induced the transient elevation of [Ca2+]i in human tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TIL) and in cultured, activated human peripheral blood-derived lymphocytes. No responses were seen in human neutrophils, monocytes, or Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines. rHuMig was chemotactic for TIL by a modified Boyden chamber assay but rHuMig was not chemotactic for neutrophils or monocytes. The CHO cell lines, IFN-gamma-treated human peripheral-blood monocytes, and IFN-gamma-treated cells of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 all secreted multiple and identical HuMig species as revealed by SDS-PAGE. Using the CHO-derived rHuMig, we have shown that the species' heterogeneity is due to proteolytic cleavage at basic carboxy-terminal residues, and that the proteolysis occurs before and not after rHuMig secretion by the CHO cells. The major species of secreted rHuMig ranged from 78 to 103 amino acids in length, the latter corresponding to the full-length secreted protein predicted from the HuMig cDNA. Carboxy-terminal-truncated forms of rHuMig were of lower specific activity compared to full-length rHuMig in the calcium flux assay, and the truncated species did not block the activity of the full- length species. It is likely that HuMig plays a role in T cell trafficking and perhaps in other aspects of the physiology of activated T cells.",,J Exp Med,778,7

This study was conducted to determine Influenza A virus and its co infection with RSV among the hospitalized children with ARI. METHODS A total of 153 throat samples of the hospitalized young children aged between below one year and 5 years with the clinical signs of ARI were collected from the different hospitals in Khuzestan from June 2009 to April 2010. The samples were tested for Influenza A viruses by real time PCR. Positive IAV samples were tested for influenza A sub type H1N1 and for RSV by the nested PCR. RESULTS In this study, from the total 153 samples, 35 samples (22.9%) including 15 (42.8%) females and 20 (57.2%) males were positive for influenza A viruses. From the 35 positive samples for IAV, 14 were positive for swine H1N1 subtype. All the positive samples for influenza showed negative for RSV infection which revealed no coinfection with RSV. The prevalence of influenza A among age/sex groups was not significant. CONCLUSION Influenza A is a prevalent viral agent isolated from young children with ARI. Influenza A subtype H1N1 was accounted for the 40 percent all laboratory-proven diagnoses of influenza in 2009.

For the first time, we completed the life cycle of P. odocoilei in three Stone's sheep (O. dalli stonei) and two thinhorn hybrids (O. dalli stonei x O. dalli dalli), each infected with 200 third-stage larvae from slugs (Deroceras laeve). The prepatent period ranged from 68 days to 74 days, and shedding of first-stage larvae (L1) peaked at >10,000 L1 per gram of feces between 90 and 110 days postinfection. A total of 75, 27, and 14 adult P. odocoilei were recovered from skeletal muscles of three Stone's sheep. Starting in the prepatent period, all infected sheep lost weight and developed peripheral eosinophilia. At 2 wk before patency, two thinhorn hybrids developed neurologic signs (hind end ataxia, loss of conscious proprioception, and hyperesthesia) that resolved at patency. Eosinophilic pleocytosis and antibody to Parelaphostrongylus spp. were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of the affected sheep, suggesting that the migration route of the ""muscleworm"" P. odocoilei may involve the central nervous system. Twenty days after treatment with ivermectin, neurologic signs recurred and larval shedding ceased in one infected thinhorn hybrid, whereas multiple treatments transiently suppressed but did not eliminate larval shedding in the other. During patency, two Stone's sheep with numerous eggs and larvae of P. odocoilei in the lungs died of respiratory failure following anesthesia or exertion. Parelaphostrongylus odocoilei has widespread geographic distribution, high prevalence, the possibility of causing neurologic and respiratory disease, resistance to treatment, and may constitute a significant emerging disease risk for thinhorn sheep.","Jenkins, E J; Hoberg, E P; Polley, L",Journal of wildlife diseases,778,29

Treatment consists of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs with methotrexate (MTX) as first choice, yet documentation of the efficacy of this treatment is limited. The objective of this review is to make an accessible overview of the existing evidence on the clinical effect of MTX in the treatment of peripheral PsA. METHODS A systematic search for randomised controlled trials was conducted using the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. Studies examining the effect of MTX on peripheral arthritis in adult patients with PsA were included. Only trials published in English were considered and for each study, the methodological quality was assessed. RESULTS Seven studies qualified given the selected criteria. None of the two placebo-controlled trials included found a significant reduction in tender and swollen joint counts. Trials comparing MTX to combination therapy with TNF-alpha inhibitor or ciclosporin A demonstrated some clinical benefits of MTX; however, combination therapy was superior to MTX monotherapy. In a strategy trial, patients were able to reach minimal disease activity with MTX treatment alone, pointing towards some efficacy of MTX on clinical manifestations. CONCLUSIONS Clinical benefits have been found in the treatment of PsA with MTX. MTX has demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of psoriasis; however, the treatment of peripheral arthritis still lacks supportive evidence. More controlled trials need to be conducted to underpin evidence-based use of MTX.","Ruhoff, Josephine Thusgaard; Horn, Hans Christian; Ellingsen, Torkell",Danish medical journal,778,28

A 5.3 kilobase viral insert in the clone pMB179 has been identified. The region of this clone coding for the spike gene has been sequenced by the chain termination method, and we present here the first report of DNA sequence data for a coronavirus spike protein, the protein which forms the characteristic 'corona' after which the group is named. The amino acid sequence of the primary translation product, deduced from the DNA sequence, predicts a polypeptide of 1162 amino acids with a molecular weight of 127 006. This has many interesting features which confirm and extend our knowledge of this recently characterized membrane glycoprotein. The polypeptide is subsequently cleaved to S1 and S2, and partial amino acid analysis of the amino-terminus of the S1 polypeptide has been employed to locate the position of this terminus of S1 within the large open reading frame. The amino acid analysis also reveals the presence of an 18 amino acid putative signal sequence on the primary translation product which is not present on the mature S1 polypeptide.","Binns, M M; Boursnell, M E; Cavanagh, D; Pappin, D J; Brown, T D",The Journal of general virology,778,1

To characterise the IBV isolates using sequence analysis. METHODS Pooled tissue samples (trachea, kidney, caecal tonsils and cloacal swabs) from 164 broiler and 53 layer flocks located throughout New Zealand were collected in transport medium containing antibiotics. Tissues were homogenised and the resultant supernatant used directly in a RT-PCR assay, and also inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old embryonated eggs for virus isolation. Primers for the RT-PCR were selected from an area close to the N-terminus of the S1 (spike) gene and bracketed the hypervariable region 1 (HVR 1). The RT-PCR amplimers were sequenced from both termini, and alignment was constructed and analysed. RESULTS From the 217 field samples that were subjected to RT-PCR, 42 (19%) were positive. Twenty-nine (69%) of these RT-PCR-positive, and none of the RT-PCR-negative, samples yielded virus by isolation in chicken embryos. A phylogenetic tree constructed from these amplimers, that spanned the HVR of the S1 gene, revealed the IBV isolates clustered into two demarcated groups which had <60% homology. It is likely that the isolates of one group were derived from the live attenuated vaccine commonly used in New Zealand. CONCLUSIONS The RT-PCR assay exhibited higher sensitivity than virus isolation and could be used for rapid diagnosis of IBV in the field. The prevalence of IBV appears to be surprisingly high in New Zealand although the use of pooled samples in the study did not allow accurate calculation of the prevalence in birds. Sequence analysis of a hypervariable region from the S1 gene was informative for the differentiation of closely-related strains.","Ramneek,; Mitchell, N L; McFarlane, R G",New Zealand veterinary journal,778,4

Eukaryotic ribosomes possess more RNA and a higher number of proteins than eubacterial ribosomes. As the tertiary structure and basic function of the ribosomes are conserved, what is the contribution of these additional elements?

As such, the role of the hospitalist as an inpatient medicine specialist has become increasingly important to many health systems. More recently, subspecialties in medicine have begun adopting the hospitalist model to care for their inpatients. This care delivery model helps provide continuity, potentially decreased cost and length of stay, and a better quality of life with a more predictable schedule for hospitalists and their outpatient colleagues. This model also aims to provide more timely consultation for inpatients, to help improve communication among inpatient caregiver teams, and to reduce redundant tests while also enhancing patient satisfaction. As a primarily outpatient procedure (and clinic)-based specialty, gastroenterology may benefit from the hospitalist model by being able to provide highly specialized care to acutely ill hospitalized patients with less disruption to outpatient schedules.

METHODS: COVID-19 daily death counts for 1,976 US nonmetropolitan counties for the period March 2-July 26, 2020, were extracted from USAFacts and merged with county-level American Community Survey and Area Health Resource File data. Covariates included county percent poverty, age composition, adjacency to a metropolitan county, health care supply, and state fixed effects. Mixed-effects negative binomial regression with random intercepts to account for repeated observations within counties were used to predict differences in the average daily increase in the COVID-19 mortality rate across quartiles of percent Black and percent Hispanic. FINDINGS: Since early March, the average daily increase in the COVID-19 mortality rate has been significantly higher in rural counties with the highest percent Black and percent Hispanic populations.

To reveal the impact of damming on the composition and flux changes of nutrients in rivers, this study conducted a detailed survey of a large sub-tropical reservoir (Xinanjiang Reservoir, XAJR) in eastern China from August 2013 to June 2014 obtaining samples at bi-monthly intervals. The thermal stratification, water quality in situ parameters, and the contents of nutrients in the water column of the river inflow, transition area, central reservoir area, and discharge water of the XAJR were analyzed in detail along the fluvial direction. The results show that the thermal stratification of the XAJR had seasonal and spatial heterogeneity. Accordingly, the pH and dissolved oxygen saturation degree in water also showed a similar stratification phenomenon. The analysis of nutrient limitation for primary productivity indicated that in different seasons, varying limiting degrees of the silicon or phosphorus were developed in different locations along the XAJR- river system. Among them, the river area and transition area were more susceptible to silicon restriction in winter, whereas phosphorus restriction mainly occurred during the warm seasons from April to October. XAJR had a retention effect on nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicon, among which phosphorus was more easily retained by the reservoir. In addition, nitrogen underwent transformation processes between different forms inside the reservoir. In the reservoir, the different degrees of retention effect of nutrients also led to a significant increase in the ratio of silicon to phosphorus and nitrogen to phosphorus in the discharged water. This study confirmed that thermal stratification has important control over the contents and forms of nutrients in water. This finding provided an idea for the restoration of the fluxes and stoichiometric ratios of the nutrients in the downstream river using the reservoir's capacity for artificial regulation.","Wang, Fushun",Water Res,778,13

These studies should have been published after the guide for the management of patients with COVID-19 from World Health Organization guide (available in March 13, 2020). RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included, in which 143 clinical samples were identified (38 of amniotic fluid; 34 of placentas or membranes; 39 from umbilical cord blood and 32 from human milk). Among the 143 samples, nine were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (one amniotic fluid sample obtained before rupturing the membranes; six samples of placenta or membranes, although authors indicate the possibility of contamination by maternal blood in three of these, and two samples of human milk). CONCLUSIONS: Following our search criteria, we found no studies that demonstrate the detection of SARS-CoV-2, in conjunction with viral isolation and the evaluation of the infective capacity of viral particles, in clinical samples of amniotic fluid, placenta or membranes, umbilical cord blood and human milk, from women with a confirmed or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.

One of the viral proteases called main protease or Mpro, plays a crucial role in the replication of SARS-CoV-2. As the structure of Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the Mpro of SARS-CoV-1 (responsible for SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004), we hypothesize that the inhibitors of SARS-CoV-1 Mpro can also inhibit the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. To test this hypothesis, a total of 79 isatin derivatives, which inhibited Mpro activity under in vitro conditions, were selected from the literature, and then screened through AutoDock Vina. The chemical features of the top 5 isatin derivatives with low binding energies (-8.5 to -8.2 kcal/mol) were used to screen similar types of compounds from several small-molecule libraries containing 15856508 compounds. A total of 1,609 compounds with similarity score &#8805; 6 were screened and then subjected to docking as well as ADME analysis.

We retrospectively reviewed all patients treated by the department of neurosurgery and cranio-maxillofacial surgery at our hospital for complex scalp deficiencies and malignant scalp tumors affecting the skull between 2006 and 2019, and extracted data on demographics, surgical technique, and perioperative complications. Thirty-seven patients were treated. Most cases were operated simultaneously (n: 32) and 6 cases in a staged procedure. Nineteen patients obtained a free flap for scalp reconstruction, 15 were treated with local axial flaps, and 3 patients underwent full thickness skin graft treatment. Complications occurred in 62% of cases, mostly related to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation disorders. New cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) disturbances occurred in 8 patients undergoing free flaps and shunt dysfunction occurred in 5 patients undergoing local axial flaps. Four patients died shortly after the surgical procedure (perioperative mortality 10.8%). Combined scalp and skull deficiency present a challenging task. An interdisciplinary treatment helps to prevent severe and specialty-specific complications, such as hydrocephalus.

To gain molecular-level insight into their astonishingly high conductivities, we combine experimental photoemission spectroscopy with DFT+&#931; current-voltage calculations on a representative Gold-MHC-Gold junction. We find that conduction across the dry, 3 nm long protein occurs via off-resonant coherent tunneling, mediated by a large number of protein valence-band orbitals that are strongly delocalized over heme and protein residues. This picture is profoundly different from the electron hopping mechanism induced electrochemically or photochemically under aqueous conditions.

The mean age was 30.67 ± 7.48 years (range, 17 to 64 years). Of all respondents, 29.4% were men. Of the staff surveyed, 43.2% had stress reaction syndrome. The highest prevalence of psychological distress was OCS (37.5%), followed by somatization symptoms (33.3%), anxiety symptoms (31.6%), and depression symptoms (29.6%). Univariate analyses indicated that female subjects, middle aged subjects, subjects in the low income group, and subjects working in isolation wards were prone to experience psychological distress. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed ""Reluctant to work or considered resignation"" (odds ratio [OR], 5.192; 95%CI, 2.396-11.250; P < .001), ""Afraid to go home because of fear of infecting family"" (OR, 2.099; 95%CI, 1.299-3.391; P = .002) ""Uncertainty about frequent modification of infection and control procedures"" (OR, 1.583; 95%CI, 1.061-2.363; P = .025), and""Social support"" (OR, 1.754; 95%CI, 1.041-2.956; P = .035) were correlated with psychological reactions. ""Reluctant to work or considered resignation"" and ""Afraid to go home because of fear of infecting family"" were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of Anxiety (OR, 3.622; 95% CI, 1.882-6.973; P < .001; OR, 1.803; 95% CI, 1.069-3.039; P = .027), OCS (OR, 5.241; 95% CI, 2.545-10.793; P < .001; OR, 1.999; 95% CI, 1.217-3.282; P = .006) and somatization (OR, 5.177; 95% CI, 2.595-10.329; P < .001; OR, 1.749; 95% CI, 1.051-2.91; P = .031). ""Stigmatization and rejection in neighborhood because of hospital work"", ""Reluctant to work or considered resignation"" and ""Uncertainty about frequent modification of infection and control procedures"" were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of Depression(OR, 2.297; 95% CI, 1.138-4.637; P = .020; OR, 3.134; 95% CI, 1.635-6.006; P = .001; OR, 1.645; 95% CI, 1.075-2.517; P = .022). CONCLUSIONS: Hospital staff showed different prevalence of psychological distress during the COVID-19 epidemic. Our study confirmed the severity of negative psychological distress on hospital staff and identified factors associated with negative psychological distress that can be used to provide valuable information for psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Juan, Yang; Yuanyuan, Cheng; Qiuxiang, You; Cong, Liu; Xiaofeng, Lai; Yundong, Zhang; Jing, Cheng; Peifeng, Qiao; Yan, Long; Xiaojiao, Xiang; Yujie, Lai",Compr Psychiatry,778,26

Clinical, radiological and laboratory data from patients who underwent lung resection from December 2019 to March 2020 were retrospectively collected until June 2020. Univariable Cox regression models were estimated to evaluate potential prognostic factors for developing COVID-19 and to investigate postoperative mortality among patients who developed symptomatic COVID-19 infection. We examined data from 107 patients. (74 lobectomies, 32 wedge/segmentectomies and 1 pneumonectomy). Twelve patients developed COVID-19 (Group 1), whereas 95 patients were not infected (Group 2). In Group 1, 6 patients (50%) died from complications related to infection; in Group 2, one patient (1%) died because of non-COVID-19-related causes. Median days from surgery to first symptoms, CT confirmation, clinical confirmation and PCR positivity was 48.1, 54.3, 55.1, and 55.2 respectively. At univariable analysis, DLCO/VA% (Pâ¯=â¯0.008), duration of the surgery (Pâ¯=â¯0.009), smoking history (pack/year) (P < 0.001), BMI (P< 0.001) and number of segments resected (Pâ¯=â¯0.010) were associated with COVID-19 onset.

Patients who undergo lung resection and then develop symptomatic COVID-19 infection are at higher risk of developing severe respiratory complications and postoperative death. Insidious symptoms' onset may lead to a delay in diagnosis. We suggest two mitigating strategies: (1) Improve symptoms surveillance and isolation during recovery period, (2) Be aware of a potential greater risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 and death correlated with elevated CCI, BMI, smoking history, DLCO/VA%, number of resected segments and duration of surgery.","Scarci, Marco; Raveglia, Federico; Bortolotti, Luigi; Benvenuti, Mauro; Merlo, Luca; Petrella, Lea; Cardillo, Giuseppe; Rocco, Gaetano",Semin. thorac. cardiovasc. surg,778,31

Nutrition is one of multiple factors that determines the immune response and good nutrition is important in supporting the immune response. Immunity can be impaired in older people, particularly those who are frail, in those living with obesity, in those who are malnourished and in those with low intakes of micronutrients. The immune impairments associated with nutritional inadequacy increase susceptibility to infection and permit infections to become more severe, even fatal. The adverse impact of poor nutrition on the immune system, including its inflammatory component, may be one of the explanations for the higher risk of more severe outcomes from infection with SARS-CoV-2 seen in older people and in those living with obesity. Studies of individual micronutrients including vitamin D and zinc suggest roles in reducing severity of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Good nutrition is also important in promoting a diverse gut microbiota, which in turn supports the immune system. The importance of nutrition in supporting the immune response also applies to assuring robust responses to vaccination.

In the UK, a public health driven policy of population ""lockdown"" has had enormous personal and economic impact. METHODS: We compare UK response and outcomes with European countries of similar income and healthcare resources. We calibrate estimates of the economic costs as different % loss in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) against possible benefits of avoiding life years lost, for different scenarios where current COVID-19 mortality and comorbidity rates were used to calculate the loss in life expectancy and adjusted for their levels of poor health and quality of life. We then apply a quality-adjusted life years (QALY) value of £30,000 (maximum under national guidelines). RESULTS: There was a rapid spread of cases and significant variation both in severity and timing of both implementation and subsequent reductions in social restrictions. There was less variation in the trajectory of mortality rates and excess deaths, which have fallen across all countries during May/June 2020. The average age at death and life expectancy loss for non-COVID-19 was 79.1 and 11.4 years, respectively, while COVID-19 were 80.4 and 10.1 years; including adjustments for life-shortening comorbidities and quality of life plausibly reduces this to around 5 QALY lost for each COVID-19 death. The lowest estimate for lockdown costs incurred was 40% higher than highest benefits from avoiding the worst mortality case scenario at full life expectancy tariff and in more realistic estimations they were over 5 times higher. Future scenarios showed in the best case a QALY value of £220k (7xNICE guideline) and in the worst-case £3.7m (125xNICE guideline) was needed to justify the continuation of lockdown. CONCLUSION: This suggests that the costs of continuing severe restrictions are so great relative to likely benefits in lives saved that a rapid easing in restrictions is now warranted.","Miles, David K; Stedman, Michael; Heald, Adrian H",Int J Clin Pract,778,1

Mentoring is a potential strategy to overcome these barriers. We piloted an in-person and telehealth mentoring strategy to implement the Telehealth-supported, Integrated Community Health Workers (CHWs), Medication-access, group visit Education (TIME) program in a community clinic. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants (n=55) were low-income Latino(a)s with type 2 diabetes. The study occurred in two, 6-month phases. Phase I provided proof-of-concept and an observational experience for the clinic team; participants (n=37) were randomized to the intervention (TIME) or control (usual care), and the research team conducted TIME while the clinic team observed. Phase II provided mentorship to implement TIME, and the research team mentored the clinic team as they conducted TIME for a new single-arm cohort of participants (n=18) with no previous exposure to the program. Analyses included baseline to 6-month comparisons of diabetes outcomes (primary outcome: hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)): phase I intervention versus control, phase II (within group), and research-run (phase I intervention) versus clinic-run (phase II) arms. We also evaluated baseline to 6-month CHW knowledge changes. RESULTS: Phase I: compared with the control, intervention participants had superior baseline to 6-month improvements for HbA1c (mean change: intervention: −0.73% vs control: 0.08%, p=0.016), weight (p=0.044), target HbA1c (p=0.035), hypoglycemia (p=0.021), medication non-adherence (p=0.0003), and five of six American Diabetes Association (ADA) measures (p<0.001–0.002). Phase II: participants had significant reductions in HbA1c (mean change: −0.78%, p=0.006), diastolic blood pressure (p=0.004), body mass index (0.012), weight (p=0.010), medication non-adherence (p<0.001), and six ADA measures (p=0.007–0.005). Phase I intervention versus phase II outcomes were comparable. CHWs improved knowledge from pre-test to post-tests (p<0.001).

When felt toward social groups, disgust can dampen empathy and promote dehumanization. Therefore, we investigated whether the BIS facilitates the dehumanization of groups associated with disease by inspiring disgust toward them. An initial content analysis found that Nazi propaganda predominantly dehumanized Jews by portraying them as disease vectors or contaminants. This inspired three correlational studies supporting a Prophylactic Dehumanization Model in which the BIS predicted disgust toward disease-relevant outgroups, and this disgust in turn accounted for the dehumanization of these groups. In a final study, we found this process of prophylactic dehumanization had a downstream effect on increasing anti-immigrant attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, consistent with the evolutionary logic of a functionally flexible BIS, this effect only occurred when the threat of COVID-19 was salient. The implications of these results for the study of dehumanization and evolutionary theories of xenophobia are discussed.

Science that explores the underappreciated local health impacts and health-related costs of climate change can enhance advocacy by demonstrating the need to both address the root causes of climate change and enhance climate resilience in vulnerable communities. The climate crisis has historically been predominantly conceived as a global environmental challenge; examination of climate impacts on public health enables researchers to localize this urgent problem for members of the public and policymakers.

As of January 2020, more than 2500 cases of MERS-CoV resulting in around 860 deaths were reported globally. In the absence of neither effective treatment nor a ready-to-use vaccine, control measures can be derived from mathematical models of disease epidemiology. In this manuscript, we propose and analyze a compartmental model of zoonotic MERS-CoV transmission with two co-circulating strains. The human population is considered with eight compartments while the zoonotic camel population consist of two compartments. The expression of basic reproduction numbers are obtained for both single strain and two strain version of the proposed model. We show that the disease-free equilibrium of the system with single stain is globally asymptotically stable under some parametric conditions. We also demonstrate that both models undergo backward bifurcation phenomenon, which in turn indicates that only keeping [Formula: see text] below unity may not ensure eradication. To the best of the authors knowledge, backward bifurcation was not shown in a MERS-CoV transmission model previously. Further, we perform normalized sensitivity analysis of important model parameters with respect to basic reproduction number of the proposed model. Furthermore, we perform optimal control analysis on different combination interventions with four components namely preventive measures such as use of masks, isolation of strain-1 infected people, strain-2 infected people and infected camels. Optimal control analysis suggests that combination of preventive measures and isolation of infected camels will eventually eradicate the disease from the community.","Ghosh, Indrajit; Nadim, Sk Shahid; Chattopadhyay, Joydev",Nonlinear Dyn,778,27

In response, many state and local governments issued shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, restricting nonessential activities outside residents' homes (2). CDC initially issued guidance recommending postponing routine adult vaccinations, which was later revised to recommend continuing to administer routine adult vaccines (3). In addition, factors such as disrupted operations of health care facilities and safety concerns regarding exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, resulted in delay or avoidance of routine medical care (4), likely further affecting delivery of routine adult vaccinations. Medicare enrollment and claims data of Parts A (hospital insurance), B (medical insurance), and D (prescription drug insurance) were examined to assess the change in receipt of routine adult vaccines during the pandemic. Weekly receipt of four vaccines (13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV13], 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine [PPSV23], tetanus-diphtheria or tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine [Td/Tdap], and recombinant zoster vaccine [RZV]) by Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65 years during January 5-July 18, 2020, was compared with that during January 6-July 20, 2019, for the total study sample and by race and ethnicity. Overall, weekly administration rates of the four examined vaccines declined by up to 89% after the national emergency declaration in mid-March (1) compared with those during the corresponding period in 2019. During the first week following the national emergency declaration, the weekly vaccination rates were 25%-62% lower than those during the corresponding week in 2019. After reaching their nadirs of 70%-89% below 2019 rates in the second to third week of April 2020, weekly vaccination rates gradually began to recover through mid-July, but by the last study week were still lower than were those during the corresponding period in 2019, with the exception of PPSV23. Vaccination declined sharply for all vaccines studied, overall and across all racial and ethnic groups.

In COVID-19, the coronavirus activates macrophages by inducing the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-18 and TNF] that can damage endothelial cells, activate platelets and neutrophils to produce thromboxane A2 (TxA2), and mediate thrombus generation. In severe cases, all these phenomena can lead to patient death. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the Toll Like Receptor (TLR) results in the release of pro-IL-1ß that is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by the production of active mature IL-1ß which is the most important cytokine in causing fever and inflammation. Its activation in COVID-19 can cause a ""cytokine storm"" with serious biological and clinical consequences. Blockade of IL-1 with inhibitory and anti-inflammatory cytokines represents a new therapeutic strategy also for COVID-19. Recently, very rare allergic reactions to vaccines have been reported, with phenomena of pulmonary thrombosis. These side effects have raised substantial concern in the population. Highly allergic subjects should therefore be vaccinated under strict medical supervision. COVID-19 has accelerated vaccine therapy but also the use of drugs and monoclonal antibodies (mABs) which have been used in COVID-19 therapy. They are primarily adopted to treat high-risk mild-to-moderate non-hospitalized patients, and it has been noted that the administration of two mABs gave better results. mABs, other than polyclonal plasma antibodies from infected subjects with SARS-CoV-2, are produced in the laboratory and are intended to fight SARS-CoV-2. They bind specifically to the antigenic determinant of the spike protein, inhibiting the pathogenicity of the virus. The most suitable individuals for mAB therapy are people at particular risk, such as the elderly and those with serious chronic diseases including diabetics, hypertension and obesity, including subjects suffering from cardiovascular diseases. These antibodies have a well-predetermined target, they bind mainly to the protein S (formed by the S1A, B, C and D subtypes), located on the viral surface, and to the S2 protein that acts as a fuser between the virus and the cell membrane. Since mABs are derived from a single splenic immune cell, they are identical and form a cell clone which can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by binding to the epitope of the virus. However, this COVID-19 therapy may cause several side effects such as mild pain, bleeding, bruising of the skin, soreness, swelling, thrombotic-type episodes, arterial hypertension, changes in heart activity, slowed bone marrow activity, impaired renal function, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, allergic reaction, fever, and possible subsequent infection may occur at the site of injection. In conclusion, the studies promoting mAB therapy in COVID-19 are very promising but the results are not yet definitive and more investigations are needed to certify both their good neutralizing effects of SARS-CoV-2, and to eliminate, or at least mitigate, the harmful side effects.","Conti, P; Pregliasco, F E; Calvisi, V; Caraffa, Al; Gallenga, C E; Kritas, S K; Ronconi, G",J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,778,18

This study aims to see how the pandemic has influenced the severity of the disease, complication, and mortality of patients undergoing emergency cholecystectomy and appendectomy. METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records of patients admitted to the emergency department and undergoing to cholecystectomy and appendicectomy in the periods from March to May 2019 and 2020. RESULTS: We observed that COVID-19 did not change the severity of presentation or the outcome of patients with gallbladder disease, but caused a 24.2% increase in the prevalence of complicated appendicitis (p<0.05). However, disagreeing with what was expected, we did not identify a greater number of perioperative complications in patients undergoing an appendectomy. CONCLUSION: Therefore, it seems that in a university tertiary referral center COVID-19 did not influence the management and outcome of inflammatory diseases treated in the surgical emergency department.","Piltcher-da-Silva, R.; Castro, T.

Patient‐facing services have been compromised for patients and clinicians alike. The implications of such disruption for dermatology undergraduate education are unknown. Numerous undergraduate programmes have faced disruption, with teaching postponed or featuring reformatted, ad‐hoc delivery. Following the pandemic, it is anticipated UK medical education will face a ‘new normal’, with a much greater emphasis on technology‐enhanced learning(1). This presents a challenge to dermatology educators as we reflect upon our undergraduate curriculum delivery in an uncertain climate.","Oki, O.; Shah, S.; Scrivens, L.; Guckian, J.",Clin Exp Dermatol,778,11

Ferroptosis is biochemically and morphologically distinct and disparate from other forms of regulated cell death. Recently, mounting studies have investigated the mechanism of ferroptosis, and numerous proteins play vital roles in regulating ferroptosis. With detailed studies, emerging evidence indicates that ferroptosis is found in multiple lung diseases, demonstrating that ferroptosis appears to be particularly important for lung diseases. The mounting interest in ferroptosis drugs specifically targeting the ferroptosis mechanism holds substantial therapeutic promise in lung diseases. The present review emphatically summarizes the functions and integrated molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis in various lung diseases, proposing that multiangle regulation of ferroptosis might be a promising strategy for the clinical treatment of lung diseases.","Ma, Tian-Liang; Zhou, Yong; Wang, Ci; Wang, Lu; Chen, Jing-Xian; Yang, Hui-Hui; Zhang, Chen-Yu; Zhou, Yong; Guan, Cha-Xiang",Oxid Med Cell Longev,778,31

Previous research suggests that BTO dielectric constant increases as nanoparticle diameter decreases. This report recounts an investigation of this relationship. Injection-molded nanocomposites of 5 vol% BTO nanoparticles incorporated in a low-density polyethylene matrix were fabricated and measured. Finite-element analysis was used to model nanocomposites of all BTO sizes and the results were compared with experimental data. Both indicated a negligible relationship between BTO diameter and dielectric constant at 5 vol%. However, a path for fabricating and testing composites of 30 vol% and higher is presented here.
