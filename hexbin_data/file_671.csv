15753,Off-label use of orthopedical trauma implants in a low-income country,2021-02-26,"Ionic crystals composed of elemental ions such as NaCl are non-polar due to directionless ionic bonding interactions. Here, we show that these can develop polarity by changing their building blocks from elemental ions to superalkali and superhalogen cluster-ions, which mimic the chemistry of alkali and halogen atoms, respectively. Due to the non-spherical geometries of these cluster ions, corresponding supersalts form anisotropic polar structures with ionic bonding, yet covalent-like directionality, akin to sp(3) hybridized systems. Using density functional theory and extensive structure searches, we predict a series of stable ferroelectric/ferroelastic supersalts, PnH(4)MX(4) (Pn = N, P; M = B, Al, Fe; X = Cl, Br) composed of superalkali PnH(4) and superhalogen MX(4) ions. Unlike traditional ferroelectric/ferroelastic materials, the cluster-ion based supersalts possess ultra-low switching barrier and can endure large ion displacements and reversible strain. In particular, PH(4)FeBr(4) exhibits triferroic coupling of ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and antiferromagnetism with controllable spin directions via either ferroelastic or 90-degree ferroelectric switching.","Gao, Yaxin; Wu, Menghao; Jena, Puru",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7910577/,671

41614,Concerns raised with MHRA of anticoagulant use during pandemic,2020-10-24,"The labour productivity index is a mainstay measure for comparing countries’ relative economic performance, but the Covid-19 pandemic could expose some of its inherent limitations: it focuses on people in work and ignores unemployment, and it is not standardised. In theory, a country’s index value could increase, even though its GDP might fall, because of significant increased unemployment in low-productivity sectors such as tourism and retail. It follows that the index value could fall when these sectors recover. Also, high-performing countries could see their index value fall because of the pandemic’s impact in high-value sectors, such as demand for oil.Consequently, a wider perspective of productivity is necessary. This paper, therefore, proposes a complementary index which adjusts labour productivity for levels of unemployment—the social labour productivity index (SLPI)—and recommends that the labour productivity index itself should be standardised. The relationship between employment and productivity is complex. For example, the UK’s economic performance, involving comparatively low labour productivity and low unemployment, has been deemed a ‘productivity puzzle’. A literature review discusses this relationship, but it is clear that econometric worldwide evaluation requires very large data sets, that are unlikely to be routinely available in practice to monitor international performance. By contrast, data sets on national productivity are small and already available, although they contain little or no data on causal factors. SLPI values were calculated for differing levels of unemployment and relative labour productivity for newly employed workers for countries where data was available; with patterns over the period 1986–2016 established for the G7 countries, Portugal, Ireland, Greece, and Spain. There were marked variations between the two indices for countries with high unemployment. The SLPI presents a practicable measure which can be utilised quickly in these unprecedented times. Using available data to compare countries’ GDP with their total workforce, it arguably provides a better measure of their overall economic and social health. Sensitivity analyses varying assumptions can model differing potential scenarios to sit alongside GDP and labour productivity index predictions.","Gandy, Rob; Mulhearn, Chris",SN Bus Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7605133/,671

57104,Revision of precautions in Japan: August 2021,2021-08-28,"There is a critical need to understand the health risks associated with vaping e-cigarettes, which has reached epidemic levels among teens. Juul is currently the most popular type of e-cigarette on the market. Using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://ctdbase.org), a public resource that integrates chemical, gene, phenotype and disease data, we aimed to analyze the potential molecular mechanisms of eight chemicals detected in the aerosols generated by heating Juul e-cigarette pods: nicotine, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, free radicals, crotonaldehyde, acetone, pyruvaldehyde, and particulate matter. Curated content in CTD, including chemical-gene, chemical-phenotype, and chemical-disease interactions, as well as associated phenotypes and pathway enrichment, were analyzed to help identify potential molecular mechanisms and diseases associated with vaping. Nicotine shows the most direct disease associations of these chemicals, followed by particulate matter and formaldehyde. Together, these chemicals show a direct marker or mechanistic relationship with 400 unique diseases in CTD, particularly in the categories of cardiovascular diseases, nervous system diseases, respiratory tract diseases, cancers, and mental disorders. We chose three respiratory tract diseases to investigate further, and found that in addition to cellular processes of apoptosis and cell proliferation, prioritized phenotypes underlying Juul-associated respiratory tract disease outcomes include response to oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and several cell signaling pathways (p38MAPK, NIK/NFkappaB, calcium-mediated).","Grondin, Cynthia J.; Davis, Allan Peter; Wiegers, Jolene A.; Wiegers, Thomas C.; Sciaky, Daniela; Johnson, Robin J.; Mattingly, Carolyn J.",Curr Res Toxicol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8379377/,671
59635,Discomfort assessment in peripheral angiography: randomized clinical trial of Iodixanol 270 versus Ioversol 320 in diabetics with critical limb ischemia.,2014,"Collateral-dependent blood flow is capable of significantly lessening the severity of stroke. Unfortunately, collateral flow varies widely in patients for reasons that remain unclear. Studies in mice have shown that the number and diameter of cerebral collaterals vary widely due primarily to polymorphisms in genes, e.g., Rabep2, involved in their formation during development. However, understanding how variation in collateral abundance affects stroke progression has been hampered by lack of a method to reversibly ligate the distal middle cerebral artery (MCAO) in mice. Here we present a method and examine infarct volume 24 h after transient (tMCAO, 90 min) versus permanent occlusion (pMCAO) in mice with good versus poor collaterals. Wildtype C57BL/6 mice (have abundant collaterals) sustained small infarctions following tMCAO that increased 2.1-fold after pMCAO, reflecting significant penumbra present at 90 min. Mutant C57BL/6 mice lacking Rabep2 (have reduced collaterals) sustained a 4-fold increase in infarct volume over WT following tMCAO and a smaller additional increase (0.4-fold) after pMCAO, reflecting reduced penumbra. Wildtype BALB/cBy (have a deficient Rabep2 variant and poor collaterals) had large infarctions following tMCAO that increased less (0.6-fold) than the above wildtype C57BL/6 mice following pMCAO. Mutant BALB/cBy mice (have deficient Rabep2 replaced with the C57BL/6 variant thus increased collaterals) sustained smaller infarctions after tMCAO. However, unlike C57BL/6 versus Rabep2 mice, penumbra was not increased since infarct volume increased only 0.3-fold following pMCAO. These findings present a murine model of tMCAO and demonstrate that neuroprotective mechanisms, in addition to collaterals, also vary with genetic background and affect the evolution of stroke.","Zhang, Hua; Faber, James E",Med one,https://doi.org/10.20900/mo.20190024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31840083/,671
60685,The OPERA study: the tenor or baritone of shorter duration of DAPT?,2014,"BACKGROUND Different gastrojejunal anastomotic (GJA) techniques have been described in laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). There is conflicting data on whether one technique is superior to the other. We aimed to compare hand-sewn (HSA), circular-stapled (CSA) and linear-stapled (LSA) anastomotic techniques in terms of stricture rates and their impact on subsequent weight loss. METHODS A prospectively collected database was used to identify patients undergoing LRYGB surgery between March 2005 and May 2012. Anastomotic technique (HSA, CSA, LSA) was performed according to individual surgeon preference. The database recorded patient demographics, relevant comorbidities and the type of GJA performed. Serial weight measurements and percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) were available at defined follow-up intervals. RESULTS Included in the data were 426 patients, divided between HSA (n = 174, 40.8%), CSA (n = 110, 25.8%) and LSA (n = 142, 33.3%). There was no significant difference in the stricture rates (HSA n = 17, 9.72%; CSA n = 9, 8.18%; LSA n = 8, 5.63%; p = 0.4006). Weight loss was similar between the three techniques (HSA, CSA and LSA) at 3 months (40.6% ± 16.2% vs 35.92% ± 21.42% vs 48.21 % ± 14.79%; p = 0.0821), 6 months (61.48% ± 23.94% vs 58.16 % ± 27.31% vs 60.18% ± 22.26%; p = 0.2296), 12 months (72.94% ± 19.93% vs 69.72 ± 21.42% vs 66.05% ± 17.75%; p = 0.0617) and 24 months (73.29% ± 22.31% vs 68.75 % ± 24.71% vs 69.40% ± 23.10%; p = 0.7242), respectively. The stricture group lost significantly greater weight (%EWL) within the first 3 months compared to the non-stricture group (45.39% ± 16.82 % vs 39.22 % ± 21.93%; p = 0.0340); however, this difference had resolved at 6 months (61.29% ± 18.50 % vs 59.79% ± 23.03%; p = 0.8802) and 12 months (71.59 % ± 18.67 % vs 68.69 % ± 22.19 %; p = 0.5970). CONCLUSIONS There was no significant difference in the rate of strictures between the three techniques, although the linear technique appears to have the lowest requirement for post-operative dilatation. The re-intervention rate will, in part, be dictated by the threshold for endoscopy, which will vary between units. Weight loss was similar between the three anastomotic techniques. Surgeons should use techniques that they are most familiar with, as stricture and weight loss rates are not significantly different.","Lee, Sangoh; Davies, Andrew R; Bahal, Sameer; Cocker, Daniel M; Bonanomi, Gianluca; Thompson, Jeremy; Efthimiou, Evangelos",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-014-1219-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24595472/,671
61687,Navien catheter experience in neuroendovascular interventions.,2017,"Background: Pain is a significant problem in adults living with advanced liver disease, having limited guidance available for its clinical management. While pain is considered a multidimensional experience, there have been limited reviews of the pain literature in advanced liver disease conducted with a multidimensional framework. Aims: The goal of this scoping review was to identify and map the multidimensional domains of pain in adults with advanced liver disease using the biopsychosocial model. Methods: We used Arksey and O'Malley's scoping framework. A search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, and CINAHL databases and the gray literature using specific eligibility criteria (1990-2019). Citation selection and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers and in duplicate. Results: Of the 43 studies that met inclusion criteria, 51% were from North America and 93% utilized quantitative methods. The combined studies reported on 168,110 participants with ages ranging between 23 to 87 years. Only 9% reported an objective scoring system for liver disease severity. Few studies reported pain classification (9%) and intensity (16%). Pain prevalence ranged between 18% and 100%, with pain locations including joint, abdomen, back, head/neck, and upper/lower extremities. We identified and mapped 115 pain factors to the biopsychosocial model: physical (81%), psychological (65%), and sociocultural (5%). Only 9% measured pain using validated multidimensional tools. Pharmacological intervention (92%) prevailed among pain treatments. Conclusions: Pain is not well understood in patients with advanced liver disease, having limited multidimensional pain assessment and treatment approaches. There is a need to systematically examine the multidimensional nature of pain in this population.","Gorospe, Franklin F; Istanboulian, Laura; Puts, Martine; Wong, David; Lee, Elizabeth; Dale, Craig M",Canadian journal of pain = Revue canadienne de la douleur,https://doi.org/10.1080/24740527.2020.1785855; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33987500/,671

63578,Initial experience with the AXERA 2 Femoral Access System in neurovascular procedures.,2015,"OBJECTIVES To characterize our institutional experience with sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in patients with vulvar cancer. We describe the oncologic outcomes of these patients and the utilization of SLN detection techniques over time. METHODS A retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent inguinofemoral SLN biopsy as part of their treatment for vulvar cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from January 1, 2000 to April 1, 2019. Patients were included in this analysis if they underwent inguinofemoral SLN biopsy for vulvar cancer, irrespective of presenting factors such as histology, tumor size or laterality. An ""at-risk groin"" was defined as either the right or left groin for which SLN biopsy of inguinofemoral lymph nodes was performed. RESULTS A total of 160 patients were included in our analysis, representing 265 at-risk groins. 114 patients had squamous cell histology representing 195 at-risk groins. Of the 169 negative groins in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, the 2 year isolated groin recurrence rate was 1.2%. SLN detection rate, irrespective of modality, was 96.2%. Technetium-99 (TC-99) + blue dye detected SLNs in 91.8% of groins; TC-99 + indocyanine green detected SLNs in 100% of groins (p=0.157). Among the 110 groins that underwent mapping with TC-99 and blue dye, 4 patients had failed mapping with blue dye and mapped with TC-99 alone (3.6%). Among the 96 groins that underwent mapping with TC-99 and ICG, 14 patients failed to map with TC-99 and mapped with indocyanine green alone (14.6%). CONCLUSIONS SLN mapping in vulvar cancer is reliable and oncologically effective. The utilization of indocyanine green for mapping has increased over the past decade and is associated with high rates of SLN detection.","Broach, Vance; Abu-Rustum, Nadeem R; Sonoda, Yukio; Brown, Carol L; Jewell, Elizabeth; Gardner, Ginger; Chi, Dennis S; Zivanovic, Oliver; Leitao, Mario M",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,https://doi.org/10.1136/ijgc-2019-000936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32075896/,671

66463,Manual aspiration thrombectomy using the Penumbra catheter in patients with acute M1 occlusion: A single-center study.,2015,"PURPOSE To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the quantitative parameters derived from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI in differentiating lacrimal gland pleomorphic adenomas (LGPAs) from lacrimal gland malignant epithelial tumors (LGMETs). METHODS Seventy-seven cases with LG epithelial tumors confirmed by histopathology (47 LGPAs and 30 LGMETs) underwent DWI and DCE-MRI. The quantitative parameters including the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), the volume transfer constant (Ktrans), the efflux rate constant from the extravascular extracellular space (EES) to blood plasma (Kep), and the extravascular extracellular volume fraction (Ve) were used to differentiate LGPAs from LGMETs. Independent-samples t test was conducted to compare these parameters. The diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS Compared with LGPAs, LGMETs had significantly lower ADC value (1.090 ± 0.169mm2/s) (P < 0.001), higher Ktrans value (0.892 ± 0.517/min) (P = 0.001), and Kep value (1.300 ± 1.131/min) (P = 0.002). ADC as a diagnostic index showed a better diagnostic efficacy in predicting malignant tumors (AUC 0.914, sensitivity 90.0%, specificity 85.1%, and accuracy 87.0%) than Ktrans and Kep alone. The combination of ADC and Ktrans presented the optimal diagnostic performance for the differentiation (AUC 0.938, sensitivity 93.3%, specificity 87.2%, accuracy 89.6%). CONCLUSION The quantitative parameters including ADC, Ktrans, and Kep derived from DWI and DCE-MRI might be potential imaging biomarkers in differentiating LGPAs from LGMETs. The combination of ADC and Ktrans is superior to other quantitative parameters in distinguishing LGPAs from LGMETs.","Wang, Yongzhe; Song, Liyuan; Guo, Jian; Xian, Junfang",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-020-02455-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32430642/,671

It is unknown what effect this has had on the physical and mental health of adolescents. OBJECTIVE Identify the impact of playing a sport during the COVID-19 pandemic on the health of student athletes. DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Sample recruited via email. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS 559 STATE-XXX high school athletes (age=15.7±1.2 yrs., female=44%) from 44 high schools completed an online survey in October 2020. A total of 171 (31%) athletes played (PLY) a fall sport, while 388 (69%) did not play (DNP). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Demographics included: sex, grade and sports played. Assessments included the General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for quality of life. Univariable comparisons between the two groups were made via t-tests or chi-square tests. Means for each continuous outcome measure were compared between the groups by ANOVA models that controlled for Age, Sex, Teaching method (Virtual, Hybrid, or In-person), and the % of students eligible for free lunch. RESULTS PLY group participants were less likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety (PLY=6.6%, DNP=44.1%, p<0.001) and depression (PLY=18.2%, DNP=40.4%, p<0.001).

CML is now managed as a chronic disease requiring both long-term treatment and close molecular monitoring in the majority of patients. AREAS COVERED Evidence suggests that in a substantial number of patients who have achieved a stable deep molecular response (DMR), TKI treatment can be safely discontinued without loss of response. Therefore, treatment-free remission (TFR), through the achievement of a DMR, is increasingly regarded as a feasible treatment goal in about 20 to 40% CML patients. Nevertheless, a proportion of patients with chronic phase CML treated with TKIs remain in stable MMR and do not achieve a DMR. EXPERT OPINION We provide prospective views on how it is possible to optimize treatment for patients in stable MMR but not in DMR in order to finalize the therapeutic strategy.","Stagno, Fabio; Breccia, Massimo; Di Raimondo, Francesco",Expert review of anticancer therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14737140.2020.1829483; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985290/,671

86658,Unprotected carotid artery stenting in modern practice.,2014,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW To assess the safety and bleeding risk in men on chronic oral anticoagulation, including antiplatelet therapies, undergoing bladder outlet procedures for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). RECENT FINDINGS There are conflicting findings; however, most recent series show that when treating bladder outlet obstruction from BPH in patients on chronic anticoagulants, there is an increased risk of hemorrhagic complications for these men. There is also an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications, especially when antithrombotic therapy is used for secondary prevention and is withdrawn perioperatively. Some have found bipolar electrosurgical vaporization of the prostate, laser vaporization, and enucleation of the prostate to provide superior hemostatic outcomes compared to classic monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate. SUMMARY Extra caution should always be given to patients on chronic anticoagulation undergoing surgical procedures, given increased risk of bleeding and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. For men with BPH undergoing bladder outlet procedures, photoselective vaporization of the prostate, Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate, and vaporization of the prostate with bipolar electrosurgical instruments may result in less bleeding complications. Further prospective randomized studies are needed to elucidate which methods provide better hemostasis and lower postoperative bleeding to best manage men with BPH on chronic antithrombotic therapy, especially when the anticoagulation therapy cannot be discontinued prior to therapy.","Marien, Tracy; Shah, Ojas",Current opinion in urology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0b013e32835ac039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23095607/,671

METHODS This multiinstitutional retrospective study involved 45 patients treated with PED across the United States. All patients included presented between November 2009 and October 2013 with cranial neuropathy (cranial nerves [CNs] II, III, IV, and VI) due to intracranial aneurysm. Outcome analysis included clinical and procedural variables at the time of treatment as well as at the latest clinical and radiographic follow-up. RESULTS Twenty-six aneurysms (57.8%) were located in the cavernous segment, while 6 (13.3%) were in the clinoid segment, and 13 (28.9%) were in the ophthalmic segment of the internal carotid artery. The average aneurysm size was 18.6 mm (range 4-35 mm), and the average number of flow diverters placed per patient was 1.2. Thirty-eight patients had available information regarding duration of cranial neuropathy prior to treatment. Eleven patients (28.9%) were treated within 1 month of symptom onset, while 27 (71.1%) were treated after 1 month of symptoms. The overall rate of cranial neuropathy improvement for all patients was 66.7%. The CN deficits resolved in 19 patients (42.2%), improved in 11 (24.4%), were unchanged in 14 (31.1%), and worsened in 1 (2.2%). Overtime, the rate of cranial neuropathy improvement was 33.3% (15/45), 68.8% (22/32), and 81.0% (17/21) at less than 6, 6, and 12 months, respectively. At last follow-up, 60% of patients in the isolated CN II group had improvement, while in the CN III, IV, or VI group, 85.7% had improved. Moreover, 100% (11/11) of patients experienced improvement if they were treated within 1 month of symptom onset, whereas 44.4% (12/27) experienced improvement if they treated after 1 month of symptom onset; 70.4% (19/27) of those with partial deficits improved compared with 30% (3/10) of those with complete deficits. CONCLUSIONS Cranial neuropathy caused by cerebral aneurysm responds similarly when the aneurysm is treated with the PED compared with open surgery and coil embolization. Lower morbidity and higher occlusion rates obtained with the PED may suggest it as treatment of choice for some of these lesions. Time to treatment is an important consideration regardless of treatment modality.","Brown, Benjamin L; Lopes, Demetrius; Miller, David A; Tawk, Rabih G; Brasiliense, Leonardo B C; Ringer, Andrew; Sauvageau, Eric; Powers, Ciarán J; Arthur, Adam; Hoit, Daniel; Snyder, Kenneth; Siddiqui, Adnan; Levy, Elad; Hopkins, L Nelson; Cuellar, Hugo; Rodriguez-Mercado, Rafael; Veznedaroglu, Erol; Binning, Mandy; Mocco, J; Aguilar-Salinas, Pedro; Boulos, Alan; Yamamoto, Junichi; Hanel, Ricardo A",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2015.4.jns142790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26473786/,671

93201,Extensive distortion and dysfunction of an Edwards Valeo Lifestent placed for stenosis of the superior vena cava.,2011,"OBJECTIVE To determine whether exposure of workers handling engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) may result in increased inflammation and changes in lung function. METHODS A prospective panel study compared changes in several markers of inflammation for ENP handling and non-ENP handling control workers. Nanoparticle exposure was measured during ENP handling and for controls. Lung function, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), C-reactive protein (CRP), blood cell counts and several serum cytokines were measured at baseline, at the end of the shift and at the end of the working week. RESULTS Nanoparticle exposure was not higher when ENPs were being handled; nanoparticle counts were higher in offices and in ambient air than in laboratories. There were no differences at baseline in lung function, FeNO, haemoglobin, platelet, white cell counts or CRP levels between those who handled nanoparticles and those who did not, with or without asthmatic participants. There were statistically significant increases in sCD40 and sTNFR2 over the working day for those who handled ENPs. The changes were larger and statistically significant over the working week and sCD62P also showed a statistically significant difference. The changes were slightly smaller and less likely to be statistically significant for atopic than for non-atopic participants. CONCLUSIONS Even at low ENP exposure, increases in three cytokines were significant over the week for those who handled nanoparticles, compared with those who did not. However, exposure to low and transient levels of nanoparticles was insufficient, to trigger measurable changes in spirometry, FeNO, CRP or blood cell counts.","Glass, Deborah Catherine; Mazhar, Mahjabeen; Xiang, Sue; Dean, Pamela; Simpson, Pamela; Priestly, Brian; Plebanski, Magdalena; Abramson, Michael; Sim, Malcolm Ross; Dennekamp, Martine",Occupational and environmental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2016-104111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28847906/,671
94475,Covidien micro vascular plug in congenital heart diseases and vascular anomalies: A new kid on the block for premature babies and older patients.,2017,"OBJECTIVES The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced health systems to offer video and telephone visits as in-person visit alternatives. Although video visits offer some benefits compared with telephone visits, they require complex setup, which may disadvantage some patients due to the ""digital divide."" Our objective was to determine patient and neighborhood characteristics associated with visit modality. STUDY DESIGN This was a cross-sectional study across 1652 primary care and specialty care practices of adult patients at an integrated health system from April 23 to June 1, 2020. METHODS We used electronic health record and administrative data. Our primary outcome was visit modality (in-person, video, or telephone), which was captured using billing codes. We assessed predictors of using video vs telephone using multivariable logistic regression. We used hierarchical logistic regression to determine the contribution of patient-, physician-, and practice-level components of variance in the choice of video or telephone visits. RESULTS We analyzed 231,596 visits by 162,102 patients. Sixty-five percent of the visits were virtual (31.7% telephone, 33.5% video). Patients who were older than 65 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.40-0.43), Black (AOR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.57-0.63), Hispanic (AOR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.73-0.80), Spanish-speaking (AOR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.52-0.61), and from areas with low broadband access (AOR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98) were less likely to use video visits. Practices (38%) and clinicians (26%) drove more of the variation in video visit use than patients (9%). CONCLUSIONS Telemedicine access differences may compound disparities in chronic disease and COVID-19 outcomes. Institutions should monitor video visit use across demographics and equip patients, clinicians, and practices to promote telemedicine equity.","Rodriguez, Jorge A; Betancourt, Joseph R; Sequist, Thomas D; Ganguli, Ishani",The American journal of managed care,https://doi.org/10.37765/ajmc.2021.88573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33471458/,671

A 52-year-old woman manifested in our hospital postprandial epigastric pain, and extrinsic compression of the celiac trunk revealed by an abdominal computed tomography. After the induction of general anesthesia, the celiac artery origin was completely skeletonized using a laparoscopic dissector and vessel sealing system. Intraoperative Doppler ultrasound demonstrated that, after surgery, the stenosis of the celiac artery, and poststenotic dilatation observed before the release of the median arcuate ligament, had completely disappeared. In conclusion, the laparoscopic release of the median arcuate ligament is a minimally invasive treatment for median arcuate ligament syndrome. The intraoperative Doppler ultrasound is useful for confirming the decompression of the celiac artery, although long-term follow-up is mandatory.","Tsujimoto, Hironori; Hiraki, Shuichi; Sakamoto, Naoko; Yaguchi, Yoshihisa; Kumano, Isao; Yoshida, Kazumichi; Matsumoto, Yusuke; Akase, Takayoshi; Horiguchi, Hiroyuki; Ono, Satoshi; Yamamoto, Junji; Hase, Kazuo","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e318243a3ab; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22487643/,671

97566,A single stent strategy in patients with lifestyle limiting claudication: 3-year results from the Durability II trial.,2015,"BACKGROUND Tunneled central venous catheters (tCVCs) are considered inferior to arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) and grafts in all nephrology guidelines. However, they are being increasingly used as hemodialysis vascular access. The purpose of this study was to document the natural history of tCVCs and determine the rate and type of catheter replacement. METHODS This was a prospective study of 141 patients who underwent hemodialysis with tCVCs between January 2008 and December 2012. The patients used 154 tCVCs. Standard protocols about management of tCVCs, according to European Renal Best Practice, were well established. All catheters were inserted in the internal jugular vein. Criteria for catheter removal were persistent bloodstream infection, detection of an outbreak of catheter-related bloodstream (CRBS) infections, or catheter dysfunction. Event rates were calculated per 1,000 catheter days; tCVC cumulative survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS Catheter replacement occurred in 15 patients (0.29 per 1,000 days); catheter dysfunction was the main cause of replacement (0.18 per 1,000 days), typically within 12 months of surgical insertion. A total of 53 CRBS events in 36 patients were identified (0.82 per 1,000 days); 17 organisms, most commonly Gram-positive pathogens, were isolated; 87% of CVC infections were treated by systemic antibiotics associated with lock therapy. tCVC cumulative survival was 91% at 1 year, 88% at 2 years and 85% at 4 years. CONCLUSIONS Our data show a high survival rate of tCVCs in hemodialysis patients, with low incidence of catheter dysfunction and CRBS events. These data justify tCVC use for hemodialysis vascular access, also as first choice, especially in patients with exhausted peripheral access and limited life expectancy.","Mandolfo, Salvatore; Acconcia, Pasqualina; Bucci, Raffaella; Corradi, Bruno; Farina, Marco; Rizzo, Maria Antonietta; Stucchi, Andrea",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.5301/jva.5000236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24811590/,671

Materials and methods: Rectangular random-pattern flaps were elevated from the back of each rat. Group I was the control group. In group II 0.1 mL of cineole, in group III 0.1 mL of alpha-pinene, in group IV 0.1 mL of camphor, in group V 0.1 mL each of alpha-pinene and cineole, in group VI 0.1 mL each of alpha-pinene and camphor, in group VII 0.1 mL each of cineole and camphor, and in group VIII, 0.1 mL each of alpha-pinene, cineole, and camphor was orally administered once a day before surgery. The luminal area of the largest blood vessel in the proximal flap was measured. Interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and vascular endothelial growth factor values were measured. Results: The mean percentage of the viable surface area was significantly greater in groups VIII, III, and V. The mean percentage of vessel diameter was significantly greater in groups V, VIII, and VII. Conclusion: We suggest that alpha-pinene and cineole were the components of RO that were responsible for increased flap survival. The most effective of feature of RO was the antiinflammatory effects.","İnce, Bilsev; Dadacı, Mehmet; Kılınç, İbrahim; Oltulu, Pembe; Yarar, Serhat; Uyar, Mehmet",Turkish journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.3906/sag-1704-166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29916225/,671
100147,"Finding your way back: wires, loops, needles and balloons.",2013,"PURPOSE Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is an emerging, minimally invasive treatment for patients with massive and submassive pulmonary embolism (PE). The value of follow-up pulmonary angiography for evaluating improvement after CDT is limited by a paucity of large studies assessing its utility and role for additional intervention. The purpose of our study was to assess the role of next-day pulmonary angiography for CDT in patients with acute massive and submassive PE undergoing continuous pulmonary arterial pressure monitoring, and secondarily, determine factors that are correlated with a need for further therapy. METHODS Patients who underwent CDT from 2006 to 2016 for massive and submassive PE were reviewed. Patient demographics, comorbidities, preprocedural lab results, noninvasive hemodynamic studies, and technical variables were recorded. Among patients receiving next-day angiography, those requiring further therapy, defined as continued CDT beyond the standard 24 hours (with or without catheter repositioning or exchange) and/or mechanical or suction thrombectomy were contrasted with those not requiring additional therapy to assess for the role of angiography and patient factors that correlate with need for further therapy. RESULTS Thirty-two patients underwent CDT for massive (n=14) and submassive (n=18) PE. Eighteen (56.3%) were male, 14 (43.7%) were Caucasian, 18 (56.3%) were African-American, with a mean age of 66.2 years (range, 26-87 years). Of the 27 (84.4%) patients that underwent next-day pulmonary angiography, 16 (59.3%) did not require additional therapy and 11 (40.7%) did require additional therapy. Additional therapy included extended CDT beyond 24 hours (n=4), mechanical/suction thrombectomy (n=5), or both extended CDT and mechanical/suction thrombectomy (n=2). Younger age (50.1 vs. 62.2 years, P = 0.039) was correlated with a need for further therapy. Initial (40.7 vs. 34.8 mmHg, P = 0.248), next-day (31.5 vs. 26.3 mmHg, P = 0.259), and interval change (4.6 vs. 8.0 mmHg, P = 0.669) in pulmonary artery pressures were not statistically significant between patient subsets. Preprocedural right ventricular/left ventricular ratio (RV/LV) also did not differ significantly (1.74 vs. 1.75, P = 0.961). Thirty-day mortality were comparable (2 vs. 1, P = 0.332). CONCLUSION Next-day pulmonary angiography is a useful method to identify patients needing additional therapy including extended CDT and/or mechanical or suction thrombectomy in acute PE management. Pulmonary arterial pressures and preprocedural RV/LV ratios were not found to be predicative of those requiring further intervention.","Ahmed, Osman; Vo, Nhi; Patel, Mikin V; DiSomma, Nerina; Ozen, Merve; Arslan, Bulent",Diagnostic and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.5152/dir.2019.18142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31120428/,671
100240,Transradial access for flow diversion of intracranial aneurysms: Case series.,2020-07-05,"Health information technology offers a powerful tool to monitor the performance of a healthcare system. Advances in computer technology and capacity combined with lower start-up costs will allow developing countries to achieve greater impact when they initiate electronic health information systems. We focused on the integrated health information system that was established in Taiwan in conjunction with the launch of the National Health Insurance (NHI) programme. We used data from that health information system to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of chemotherapy use among breast cancer patients. We then used this analysis to discuss what policy makers can learn from this type of analysis. We identified a cohort of patients in the NHI Research Database who had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2001 and had received chemotherapy following surgical removal of the tumour. We followed these patients for 3 years and conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from the payer's perspective. Using the net benefit regression approach, we compared the cost effectiveness of the two most commonly prescribed first-line chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of breast cancer in 2001 in Taiwan. The dependent variable of the regression model was the individual-level net benefit, and the independent variables included a binary variable indicating the choice of chemotherapy regimen, the patients' age, co-morbidity, type of surgery, geographic region and type of treatment facility. We employed both frequentist and Bayesian approaches in our net benefit regression analyses. In the Bayesian analysis, we applied non-informative priors to all parameters in the base-case analyses. We then explored the use of informative priors in the sensitivity analysis, using cost-effectiveness data published in the literature to form the prior distributions for the relevant parameters. Over 60% of surgically treated breast cancer patients received either CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil) or CEF (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, fluorouracil). A comparison of patient characteristics indicated that patients in the CEF group tended to be younger (47.8 vs 49.1 years; p = 0.016), and were significantly more likely to have undergone a mastectomy (84% vs 76%; p < 0.001) and to have been treated in a teaching hospital (26% vs 13%; p < 0.001). We also observed significant variations in geographic region of the location of facilities between treatment groups. On average, CEF was not cost effective in the treatment of patients with breast cancer in Taiwan, although analyses stratified by geographic region suggested a wide variation across regions. At a societal willingness to pay (WTP) of new Taiwanese dollar ($NT)1 500 000 ($US80 000), the probability that CEF was more cost effective than CMF was 0.0%, 0.0%, 0.0% and 3.9% for the Taipei metropolitan area, and the north, middle and the combined south and east region, respectively; the probability became 0.6%, 0.0%, 1.3% and 54.5%, respectively, at a WTP of $NT5 000 000 ($US270 000). After co-variate adjustments, the probabilities were 0.0%, 0.0%, 0.0% and 0.8%, respectively at a WTP of $NT1 500 000, and were 0.0%, 0.0%, 1.4% and 34.7% at $NT5 000 000. Sensitivity analyses showed that CEF potentially could have been more cost effective than CMF within a reasonable range of societal WTP (i.e. $NT1 000 000-3 000 000 or $US55 000-160 000) had the optimal dosage level for CEF been established for breast cancer patients in Taiwan. A population-based, fully integrated electronic health information system provides useful data to assess the cost effectiveness of competing treatments and interventions in current practice. This research may potentially inform policy makers of modifications that can be instituted to improve the cost effectiveness of a new therapy. However, findings from this study need to be interpreted with caution because the study provided information only on the short-term cost effectiveness (i.e. 3 years) of CEF compared with CMF. It is possible that a future analysis will reach a different conclusion when more years of follow-up data become available.","Shih, Ya-Chen Tina; Pan, I-Wen; Tsai, Yi-Wen",PharmacoEconomics,https://doi.org/10.2165/11314110-000000000-00000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19888794/,671
100798,Use of stent retriever for treatment of iatrogenic intracranial vasospasm.,2019,"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Dec 2019 and has spread globally. Diabetics are at increased risk of infections caused by a variety of pathogens including virus. The present research was aimed to describe clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with diabetes. METHODS A retrospective multicenter study of COVID-19 patients with diabetes was conducted in four hospitals in Wuhan, Shanghai and Anhui Province. RT-PCR or next generation sequencing was executed to confirm the existence of SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory specimens. RESULTS 54 diabetics (10.36%) were recruited from 521 COVID-19 patients, with a median age of 63 (IQR, 52-70) years. Among them, 51 were previously diagnosed with diabetes and 3 were newly diagnosed based on HbA1c over 6.5%. For COVID-19, 47 of the 54 patients had an exposure history. Fever (47/54, 87.04%), dry cough (36/54, 66.67%) and expectoration (21/53, 39.62%) were among the top three symptoms. Lung infiltration was bilateral (46/52, 88.46%) and multilobe (47/52, 90.38%), and ground-glass opacity (36/37, 97.30%) was the most common pattern in radiological images. Besides, COVID-19 patients with diabetes were prone to be classified as severe or critical type (46.30%, 25/54) and complicated with acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute kidney injury. The proportion of ICU admission and death among the COVID-19 diabetics were 14.81% (8/54) and 12.96% (7/54), respectively. CONCLUSIONS With older age, diabetics diagnosed as COVID-19 were prone to developing into severe type, and exhibited a high rate of ICU admission and mortality.

Surgical repair of this problem is challenged by a paucity of soft tissue, poor functional outcome, and a high rate of recurrence. Acellular dermal matrix has become increasingly popular in reconstructive surgery--at times--as an alternative to local and free tissue transfer in different parts of the body. However, its applicability in contracture release, particularly in hand surgery, has not been widely explored. METHODS Nine patients with burn contracture scars involving different locations in the hand and the wrist underwent two-stage reconstruction consisting of contracture release and use of acellular dermal matrix followed by definitive coverage with skin graft at the second stage. Patients were followed up for a period of at least 10 months (range, 10 to 25 months), during which time the passive range of motion of the hand was used as a quantitative measure of surgical outcome. RESULTS All nine patients retained at least 83 percent of the corrected range of motion involving the affected joints by 1 year and at least 89 percent of correction at each webspace. No patient required a revision procedure. CONCLUSION Acellular dermal matrix can be an effective tool in surgical treatment of difficult burn contracture deformity in the hand, with lasting results.","Askari, Morad; Cohen, Myles J; Grossman, Peter H; Kulber, David A",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0b013e31820a6511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21460666/,671

105144,Predictors for prolonged hospital stay after transcatheter mitral valve repair with the MitraClip.,2014,"Despite substantial advances in anesthesia safety within the past decades, perioperative mortality remains a prevalent problem and can be considered among the top causes of death worldwide. Acute organ failure is a major risk factor of morbidity and mortality in surgical patients and develops primarily as a consequence of a dysregulated inflammatory response and insufficient tissue perfusion. Neurological dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, intestinal dysfunction, and hepatic impairment are among the most serious complications impacting patient outcome and recovery. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative arrangements, such as enhanced recovery after surgery programs, can contribute to lowering the occurrence of organ dysfunction, and mortality rates have improved with the advent of specialized intensive care units and advances in procedures relating to extracorporeal organ support. However, no specific pharmacological therapies have proven effective in the prevention or reversal of perioperative organ injury. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms of organ dysfunction is essential to identify novel treatment strategies to improve perioperative care and outcomes for surgical patients. This review focuses on recent knowledge of pathophysiological and molecular pathways leading to perioperative organ injury. Additionally, we highlight potential therapeutic targets relevant to the network of events that occur in clinical settings with organ failure.","Conrad, Catharina; Eltzschig, Holger K",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000005191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33186161/,671
105420,Aortic and coronary aneurysms: are they really distinct entities?,2015,"PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE To evaluate and compare the incidences of post-operative pelvic pain (PPP) in patients undergoing ablation, enucleation and conventional transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Using MEDLINE via PubMed and Cochrane CENTRAL, randomised control trials (RCTs) and observational studies reporting PPP rates post-ablation, enucleation or TURP were identified. The risk of biases (RoB) in RCTs and observation studies were assessed using the Cochrane RoB1.0 tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, respectively. RESULTS 62 studies were included for qualitative analysis, while 51 of them reported number of patients with PPP post-intervention. Three observational studies and 13 RCTs compared the rates of PPP in patients undergoing ablation, enucleation or TURP. The most reported types of PPP are dysuria, abdominal pain and irritative symptoms. The pooled incidence of PPP at 1-month follow-up in patients undergoing ablation, enucleation and TURP were 0.15 (95% CI 0.10-0.22), 0.09 (95% CI 0.04-0.19 and 0.10 (95% CI 0.06-0.15), respectively. PPP is no longer prevalent at 3-months and onwards post-operatively. Ablation is associated with a higher risk of PPP than enucleation (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.04-4.62) and TURP (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.03-5.62) in observational studies but not RCTs; and there were no significant differences in the rates of PPP upon comparison of other modalities. CONCLUSION PPP is common after transurethral benign prostatic hyperplasia surgery. Patients undergoing ablation had a higher rate of post-intervention PPP than those undergoing enucleation and TURP in observational studies.","Wroclawski, Marcelo Langer; Castellani, Daniele; Heldwein, Flavio L; Teles, Saulo Borborema; Cha, Jonathan Doyun; Zhao, Hongda; Herrmann, Thomas; Chan, Vinson Wai-Shun; Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun",World journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00345-021-03678-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33787985/,671

Methods The literature at home and abroad on the treatment of ONFH with vascularized bone grafting was reviewed, and the mechanism, operating methods and effectiveness, indications, and complications were summarized. Results Vascularized bone grafting is a commonly used clinical hip-preserving operation. By replacing necrotic bone tissue with vascularized bone, it can rebuild the blood circulation system, promote the healing of the necrotic area, and provide biomechanical support for the necrotic area of the femoral head, prevent the joint surface collapse. The main operations include the vascularized iliac bone flap grafting, the vascularized greater trochanter bone flap grafting, and the vascularized fibular grafting. The clinical application has achieved certain effectiveness, and the different procedures are suitable for different types of patients. The procedures need to be selected based on the patient's overall condition, the cause of ONFH, the necrosis stage, and the degree of the evaluation. Conclusion Vascularized bone grafting has a definite effectiveness in the treatment of ONFH in the young and middle-aged. It can significantly improve hip joint function, control the further development of the disease to a great extent, effectively delay or even avoid hip arthroplasty. It is a reliable hip-preserving operation worthy of promotion.","Ding, Haibo; Wang, Yang; Lu, Yun",Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi = Chinese journal of reparative and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.7507/1002-1892.202006053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719249/,671
112523,"Alternative technique for clot retrieval: The ""tip of the iceberg"" technique.",2015,"Achieving radical tumor resection while preserving disease-free tissue during breast-conserving surgery (BCS) remains a challenge. Here, mass spectrometry technologies were used to discriminate stromal tissues reported to be altered surrounding breast tumors, and build tissue classifiers ex vivo. Additionally, we employed the approach for in vivo and real-time classification of breast pathology based on electrosurgical vapors. Breast-resected samples were obtained from patients undergoing surgery at MUMC+. The specimens were subsequently sampled ex vivo to generate electrosurgical vapors analyzed by rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS). Tissues were processed for histopathology to assign tissue components to the mass spectral profiles. We collected a total of 689 ex vivo REIMS profiles from 72 patients which were analyzed using multivariate statistical analysis (principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis). These profiles were classified as adipose, stromal and tumor tissues with 92.3% accuracy with a leave-one patient-out cross-validation. Tissue recognition using this ex vivo-built REIMS classification model was subsequently tested in vivo on electrosurgical vapors. Stromal and adipose tissues were classified during one BCS. Complementary ex vivo analyses were performed by REIMS and by desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) to study the potential of breast stroma to guide BCS. Tumor border stroma (TBS) and remote tumor stroma (RTS) were classified by REIMS and DESI-MS with 86.4% and 87.8% accuracy, respectively. We demonstrate the potential of stromal molecular alterations surrounding breast tumors to guide BCS in real-time using REIMS analysis of electrosurgical vapors.","Vaysse, Pierre-Maxence; Kooreman, Loes F S; Engelen, Sanne M E; Kremer, Bernd; Olde Damink, Steven W M; Heeren, Ron M A; Smidt, Marjolein L; Porta Siegel, Tiffany",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-77102-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33208813/,671
115109,A provisional strategy for treating true bifurcation lesions employing a scoring balloon for the side branch: final results of the AGILITY trial.,2013,"BACKGROUND American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) clinical practice guidelines on the evaluation of pulmonary nodules may have low adoption among clinicians in Asian countries. Unique patient characteristics of Asian patients affect the diagnostic evaluation of pulmonary nodules. The objective of these clinical practice guidelines was to adapt those of CHEST to provide consensus-based recommendations relevant to practitioners in Asia. METHODS A modified ADAPTE process was used by a multidisciplinary group of pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons in Asia. An initial panel meeting analyzed all CHEST recommendations to achieve consensus on recommendations and identify areas that required further investigation before consensus could be achieved. Revised recommendations were circulated to panel members for iterative review and redrafting to develop the final guidelines. RESULTS Evaluation of pulmonary nodules in Asia broadly follows those of the CHEST guidelines with important caveats. Practitioners should be aware of the risk of lung cancer caused by high levels of indoor and outdoor air pollution, as well as the high incidence of adenocarcinoma in female nonsmokers. Furthermore, the high prevalence of granulomatous disease and other infectious causes of pulmonary nodules need to be considered. Therefore, diagnostic risk calculators developed in non-Asian patients may not be applicable. Overall, longer surveillance of nodules than those recommended by CHEST should be considered. CONCLUSIONS TB in Asia favors lesser reliance on PET scanning and greater use of nonsurgical biopsy over surgical diagnosis or surveillance. Practitioners in Asia are encouraged to use these adapted consensus guidelines to facilitate consistent evaluation of pulmonary nodules.","Bai, Chunxue; Choi, Chang-Min; Chu, Chung Ming; Anantham, Devanand; Chung-Man Ho, James; Khan, Ali Zamir; Lee, Jang-Ming; Li, Shi Yue; Saenghirunvattana, Sawang; Yim, Anthony",Chest,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2016.02.650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26923625/,671

METHODS A survey was conducted in all 6 neurosurgical departments in the Veneto region to collect data about surgical, inpatient care and endovascular procedures during the month of March for each year from 2016 to 2020. Safety measures to avoid infection from SARS-CoV-2 and any COVID-19 cases reported among neurosurgical patients or staff members were considered. RESULTS The mean number of neurosurgical admissions for the month of March over the 2016-2019 period was 663, whereas in March 2020 admissions decreased by 42%. Emergency admissions decreased by 23%. The average number of neurosurgical procedures was 697, and declined by 30% (range -10% to -51% in individual centers). Emergency procedures decreased in the same period by 23%. Subarachnoid hemorrhage and spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage both decreased in Veneto-by 25% and 22%, respectively. Coiling for unruptured aneurysm, coiling for ruptured aneurysm, and surgery for ruptured aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation diminished by 49%, 27%, and 78%, respectively. Endovascular procedures for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) increased by 33% in 2020 (28 procedures in total). There was a slight decrease (8%) in brain tumor surgeries. Neurosurgical admissions decreased by 25% and 35% for head trauma and spinal trauma, respectively, while surgical procedures for head trauma diminished by 19% and procedures for spinal trauma declined by 26%. Admissions and surgical treatments for degenerative spine were halved. Eleven healthcare workers and 8 patients were infected in the acute phase of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS This multicenter study describes the effects of a COVID-19 outbreak on neurosurgical activities in a vast region in Italy. Remodulation of neurosurgical activities has resulted in a significant reduction of elective and emergency surgeries compared to previous years. Most likely this is a combined result of cancellation of elective and postponable surgeries, increase of conservative management, increase in social restrictions, and in patients' fear of accessing hospitals. Curiously, only endovascular procedures for AIS have increased, possibly due to reduced physical activity or increased thrombosis in SARS-CoV-2. The confounding effect of thrombectomy increase over time cannot be excluded. No conclusion can be drawn on AIS incidence. Active monitoring with nasopharyngeal swabs, wearing face masks, and using separate pathways for infected patients reduce the risk of infection.","Raneri, Fabio; Rustemi, Oriela; Zambon, Giampaolo; Del Moro, Giulia; Magrini, Salima; Ceccaroni, Yuri; Basso, Elisabetta; Volpin, Francesco; Cappelletti, Martina; Lardani, Jacopo; Ferraresi, Stefano; Guida, Franco; Chioffi, Franco; Pinna, Giampietro; Canova, Giuseppe; d'Avella, Domenico; Sala, Francesco; Volpin, Lorenzo",Neurosurgical focus,https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.9.focus20691; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260134/,671
118630,Pipeline embolization device deployment via an envoy distal access XB guiding catheter-biaxial platform: A technical note.,2016,"OBJECTIVES In traumatically injured patients, excessive blood loss necessitating the transfusion of red blood cell (RBC) units is common. Indicators of early RBC transfusion in the pre-hospital setting are needed. This study aims to evaluate the association between hypothermia (<36°C) and transfusion risk within the first 24 hours after arrival to hospital for a traumatic injury. METHODS We completed an audit of all traumatically injured patients who had emergent surgery at a single tertiary care center between 2010 and 2014. Using multivariable logistic regression analysis, we evaluated the association between pre-hospital hypothermia and transfusion of ≥1 unit of RBC within 24 hours of arrival to the trauma bay. RESULTS Of the 703 patients included to evaluate the association between hypothermia and RBC transfusion, 203 patients (29%) required a transfusion within 24 hours. After controlling for important confounding variables, including age, sex, coagulopathy (platelets and INR), hemoglobin, and vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate), hypothermia was associated with a 68% increased odds of transfusion in multivariable analysis (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.11-2.56). CONCLUSIONS Hypothermia is strongly associated with RBC transfusion in a cohort of trauma patients requiring emergent surgery. This finding highlights the importance of early measures of temperature after traumatic injury and the need for intervention trials to determine if strategies to mitigate the risk of hypothermia will decrease the risk of transfusion and other morbidities.","Jivraj, Naheed K; Kaustov, Lilia; Hao, Kennedy Ning; Strauss, Rachel; Callum, Jeannie; Tien, Homer; Alam, Asim Q",CJEM,https://doi.org/10.1017/cem.2019.412; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084553/,671
121384,Stent apposition in late and very late stent thrombosis: the apposing views.,2013,"Fifty years ago, David Baltimore published a brief conceptual paper delineating the classification of viruses by the routes of genome expression. The six ""Baltimore classes"" of viruses, with a subsequently added 7th class, became the conceptual framework for the development of virology during the next five decades. During this time, it became clear that the Baltimore classes, with relatively minor additions, indeed cover the diversity of virus genome expression schemes that also define the replication cycles. Here, we examine the status of the Baltimore classes 50 years after their advent and explore their links with the global ecology and biology of the respective viruses. We discuss an extension of the Baltimore scheme and why many logically admissible expression-replication schemes do not appear to be realized in nature. Recent phylogenomic analyses allow tracing the complex connections between the Baltimore classes and the monophyletic realms of viruses. The five classes of RNA viruses and reverse-transcribing viruses share an origin, whereas both the single-stranded DNA viruses and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses evolved on multiple independent occasions. Most of the Baltimore classes of viruses probably emerged during the earliest era of life evolution, at the stage of the primordial pool of diverse replicators, and before the advent of modern-like cells with large dsDNA genomes. The Baltimore classes remain an integral part of the conceptual foundation of biology, providing the essential structure for the logical space of information transfer processes, which is nontrivially connected with the routes of evolution of viruses and other replicators.","Koonin, Eugene V; Krupovic, Mart; Agol, Vadim I",Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,https://doi.org/10.1128/mmbr.00053-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34259570/,671

METHODS Oncology care providers (n=2,008) participated in a survey in which they identified barriers and promoters for delivering psychosocial care at their respective institutions. Multilevel modeling was used to examine (1) the extent to which provider and institutional characteristics were associated with the most common barriers, and (2) associations between perceived barriers and institutional capacity to deliver psychosocial services as measured by the Cancer Psychosocial Care Matrix. RESULTS Across 58 Commission on Cancer-accredited programs in North America, the most frequently reported barriers were inadequate number of psychosocial care personnel, lack of funding, inadequate amount of time, lack of systematic procedures, and inadequate training for oncology providers. Overall, there were few significant differences in reported barriers by type of institution or type of provider. In general, the most frequently reported barriers were significantly associated with the institution's capacity to deliver quality psychosocial care. In particular, the lack of a systematic process for psychosocial care delivery significantly predicted lower levels of institutional capacity to deliver quality psychosocial care. CONCLUSIONS When identifying barriers, respondents reported a greater number of institutional barriers than barriers related to individual provider or patient characteristics. These results present a compelling case for cancer programs to implement and monitor systematic procedures for psychosocial care and to integrate these procedures in routine clinical practice.

This study aimed to evaluate changes in physical activity (PA), mental health, sleep, and social media use among adolescent girls during lockdown. METHODS 281 female pupils (12-14 y) taking part in the ongoing Walking In Schools study on the island of Ireland self-reported PA, mental health, sleep, and social media use before (September-October 2019) and during lockdown (May-June 2020), via questionnaires. These were supplemented with open-ended structured interviews conducted with 16 girls during lockdown. RESULTS During the period of lockdown and school closures, pupils tried new forms of PA and undertook PA with family, but there was no significant change in self-reported PA. There was a decline in health-related quality of life and motivation for exercise; however, self-efficacy for walking and happiness with appearance increased. There was no change in sleep quality or social media usage.

Previous studies revealed only a limited number of candidate genes for camptothecin biosynthesis in Camptotheca acuminata, and it is still poorly understood how its biosynthesis of camptothecin has evolved. Here, we report a high-quality, chromosome-level C. acuminata genome assembly. We find that C. acuminata experiences an independent whole-genome duplication and numerous genes derive from it are related to camptothecin biosynthesis. Comparing with Catharanthus roseus, the loganic acid O-methyltransferase (LAMT) in C. acuminata fails to convert loganic acid into loganin. Instead, two secologanic acid synthases (SLASs) convert loganic acid to secologanic acid. The functional divergence of the LAMT gene and positive evolution of two SLAS genes, therefore, both contribute greatly to the camptothecin biosynthesis in C. acuminata. Our results emphasize the importance of high-quality genome assembly in identifying genetic changes in the evolutionary origin of a secondary metabolite.","Kang, Minghui; Fu, Rao; Zhang, Pingyu; Lou, Shangling; Yang, Xuchen; Chen, Yang; Ma, Tao; Zhang, Yang; Xi, Zhenxiang; Liu, Jianquan",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23872-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34112794/,671

The SDG outcomes are structured through the interconnectivities of the three 'wedding cake' layers of 'economy', 'society' and 'biosphere', as posited by the Stockholm Resilience Centre. The key policy contribution is to quantify the resulting SDG synergies and trade-offs, whilst also decomposing and calculating the part-worth of the market drivers which contribute to these outcomes. The paper employs a global economic simulation model that combines rational market behaviour with environmental constraints (MAGNET) and is further extended with an SDG metrics module. A 'non-sustainable' world reveals trade-offs between economy and biosphere SDGs, with population growth of particular concern to a safe planetary operating space in the world's poorest regions. Sustainable visions could reduce natural resource pressures and emissions and meet energy requirements at potentially limited economic cost. Notwithstanding, these futures do not address income inequalities and potentially increase food security concerns for the most vulnerable members of society. Consequently, developed region led international cooperation and in-kind income transfers to developing countries, constitutes a necessary prerequisite to help remedy the SDG trade-offs exhibited within the more sustainable global pathways.","Philippidis, George; Shutes, Lindsay; M'Barek, Robert; Ronzon, Tévécia; Tabeau, Andrzej; van Meijl, Hans",Journal of cleaner production,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32921933/,671

Selected service should be Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant at minimum and a Business Associate Agreement should be in place for protection of privacy. Ensuring the compatibility of the designated clinic computer with the system's requirements and installation of all safeguards must follow. Appointments should be documented in the same manner as in-office visits and teledentistry patients must be located within the clinician's statutory license boundary. Informed consent forms should include teledentistry or a supplemental teledentistry consent form should be used.

132672,Perioperative management of drug-eluting stents: the Achilles heel of bridging.,2013,"BACKGROUND Adolescents' health-related behavior varies from weekday to weekend. Only few studies, however, have examined to which degree such variation will affect markers of cardiometabolic health. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to examine if markers of cardiometabolic health differ between different days of the week in adolescents. METHODS This cross-sectional school-based study included up to 581 participants, 11-17 years old. Markers of metabolic health were insulin, glucose, triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and blood pressure. Linear mixed regression modelling was used to examine the cardiometabolic profile across weekdays. RESULTS Significant declining trends were observed across the week in adolescents' levels of cardiometabolic health markers. Lower levels of insulin (16.1%), glucose (2.6%) and triglyceride (24.7%) were observed on Fridays compared to Mondays (p ≤ 0.006). Gradual improvement in measurement profiles across weekdays was less apparent for HDL-C, LDL-C, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (P ≥ 0.06). Analyses stratified by sex suggested a more noticeable pattern of gradual improvement across weekdays in boys than in girls. CONCLUSION Significantly lower levels of insulin, glucose and triglyceride were observed in adolescents on Fridays compared to Mondays. However, when sex specific analyses were performed significant profile variations were only observed across the week in boys. More research is needed to better understand which behavioral factors in particular seem to influence weekly variation in markers of cardiometabolic health - especially since such variation potentially will have an impact on how assessments of markers of cardiometabolic health optimally should be planned, standardized and carried out, both in research and in medical practice.","Hansen, Louise Sølund; Pedersen, Marlene Rosager Lund; Tarp, Jakob; Bugge, Anna; Wedderkopp, Niels; Møller, Niels Christian",BMC cardiovascular disorders,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-020-01692-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894053/,671

The patients had an average age of 71 years (range, 63-83 years) and an average body mass index (BMI) of 24.3 kg/m(2) (range, 21-28 kg/m(2)). The average operating time was 89 min (range, 75-115 min). No significant blood loss or complications occurred. The average length of hospital stay was 5.4 days (range, 4-11 days). The average incision length was 3.1 cm (range, 2.5-4.5 cm). Histopathology showed adequate tumor excision margins and an average lymph node yield of 15 nodes (range, 7-26 nodes). CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic surgery for colectomy is feasible. It can be performed without specialized instrumentation and at no extra cost. Further evaluation is required.","Rieger, Nicholas A; Lam, Francis F",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0683-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19760335/,671

The current COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity for greater use of TeleNP and understanding of neuropsychologists' experience with this unique assessment medium. METHODS During the course of a no-cost global webinar related to practical/ethical considerations of TeleNP practice, attendees were invited to engage in a 26-question survey about their TeleNP use and related COVID-19 concerns. TeleNP practices before the COVID-19 pandemic and early on during the global outbreak were queried among survey participants, along with examination of TeleNP intentions following COVID-19. RESULTS Multiple countries were represented across five continents, with two-thirds of respondents being from the United States. Approximately one-fourth of respondents reported using TeleNP for clinical interview, feedback, and intervention prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and approximately one-tenth of individuals used TeleNP for testadministration. Increased use of TeleNP for clinical interview, feedback, and intervention was reported within the first few weeks of the global COVID-19 outbreak, though the use of TeleNP for testing remained relatively unchanged. Most respondents indicated an intention for future use of TeleNP. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest the use of TeleNP is increasing, although use of remote TeleNP testing is still developing. Findings also illustrate increasing use of TeleNP in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and encourage follow-up investigation in future studies to understand the changing practices and rates of TeleNP provision over time.","Hammers, Dustin B; Stolywk, Renerus; Harder, Lana; Cullum, C Munro",The Clinical neuropsychologist,https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2020.1810323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32844714/,671

This binding requires the RBD to undergo a conformational change from a closed to an open state. In the present study, a key pair of salt bridges formed by the side chains of K537 and E619, residues at the interfaces of SD1 and SD2, respectively, was identified to promote the opening of the RBD. Mutations of K537Q and E619D reduced their side chain lengths and eliminated this pair of salt bridges; as a result, the opening of the RBD was not observed in the MD simulations. Thus, blocking the formation of this pair of salt bridges is a promising approach for treating novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). FDA approved drug molecules were screened by their capabilities of blocking the formation of the key pair of salt bridges, achieved by their positional stabilities in the cavity containing the side chains of K537 and E619 formed in the interface between SD1 and SD2. Simeprevir, imatinib, and naldemedine were identified to possess the desired capability with the most favorable interaction energies.","Mao, Ruichao; Bie, Lihua; Xu, Maofeng; Wang, Xiaocong; Gao, Jun",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1cp01045j; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34008647/,671

However, encapsidation by rubella virus capsid protein is specific for 40S genomic RNA. As a first step toward understanding the assembly of rubella virus nucleocapsid at the molecular level, the interaction between capsid protein and genomic RNA was studied by Northwestern (RNA-protein) blot analysis. RNA probes prepared by in vitro transcription were used to localize the RNA sequence that participates in binding to the capsid protein. We have identified a 29-nucleotide RNA sequence (nucleotides 347 to 375) that is essential for the binding. By using overlapping synthetic peptides of capsid protein, a peptide domain (residues 28 to 56) that displays specific RNA-binding activity of capsid protein has been located. This result suggests that the specific recognition of viral RNA during rubella virus assembly involves, at least in part, the nucleocapsid protein.","Liu, Z; Yang, D; Qiu, Z; Lim, K T; Chong, P; Gillam, S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8642641/,671

The aim of the study was to present our preliminary experience in laparoscopic cholecystectomy through single intraumbilical incision. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three patients with gallbladder symptoms (2 female, 1 male) underwent surgery through single intraumbilical incision. In two cases the procedure was performed with three 5 mm Dexide port approach and in one, with a flexible rubber/gel SILSTM-Port (Covidien, USA) access. A simple 5 mm optics was employed. In two procedures the following disposable instruments were used: roticulator Endo dissect, roticulator Endo grasp, mini Sears scissors as well as standard hook and clips while for the third procedure, a conventional multi-use grasp and roticular Endo dissect. The gallbladder was elevated to the integuments by two sutures to expose Calot's triangle and bladder site. Following exposure, the bile duct and the vesical artery were clipsed and cut routinely to remove the gallbladder in a plastic bag through the bell-button. After procedures no drains were left in the peritoneal cavities. RESULTS In all three cases the laparoscopic procedure was performed. The median operative time was 88 min. In one female patient, bleeding into the peritoneal cavity was reported and called for laparotomy within a few hours of laparoscopic procedure. Intraoperatively, the branch of vesical artery was sutured to arrest bleeding. The median hospital stay following procedure was 3, 8 and 5 days respectively. After the procedure, the last female patient was observed to have pharyngitis and enlarged jugular lymph nodes that abated after antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be performed by experienced laparoscopic surgeons. For adequate evaluation of the efficacy and safety of this procedure it is necessary to perform further clinical studies on a larger number of patients.","Misiak, Andrzej; Szczepanik, Andrzej B",Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19999799/,671

248446,Delayed follow-up of medical retina patients due to COVID-19: impact on disease activity and visual acuity,2021,"BACKGROUND: As COVID-19 vaccine distribution efforts continue, public health workers can strategize about vaccine promotion in an effort to increase willingness among those who may be hesitant. METHODS: In April 2020, we surveyed a national probability sample of 2279 U.S. adults using an online panel recruited through address-based sampling. Households received a computer and internet access if needed to participate in the panel. Participants were invited via e-mail and answered online survey questions about their willingness to get a novel coronavirus vaccine when one became available. The survey was completed in English and Spanish. We report weighted percentages. RESULTS: Most respondents were willing to get the vaccine for themselves (75%) or their children (73%). Notably, Black respondents were less willing than White respondents (47% vs. 79%, p < 0.001), while Hispanic respondents were more willing than White respondents (80% vs. 75%, p < 0.003). Females were less likely than makes (72% vs. 79%, p < 0.001). Those without insurance were less willing than the insured (47% vs. 78%, p < 0.001). Willingness to vaccinate was higher for those age 65 and older than for some younger age groups (85% for those 65 and older vs. 75% for those 50-64, p < 0.017; 72% for those 35-49, p < 0.002; 70% for those 25-34, p = NS and 75% for ages 18-24, p = NS), but other groups at increased risk because of underlying medical conditions or morbid obesity were not more willing to get vaccinated than their lower risk counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Most Americans were willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine, but several vulnerable populations reported low willingness. Public health efforts should address these gaps as national implementation efforts continue.","Kelly, Bridget J; Southwell, Brian G; McCormack, Lauren A; Bann, Carla M; MacDonald, Pia D M; Frasier, Alicia M; Bevc, Christine A; Brewer, Noel T; Squiers, Linda B",BMC Infect Dis,,671

299804,BBIBP-CorV,2021,"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 has led to the death of thousands of adults worldwide. It is now clear that the hyper-inflammatory response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 plays a major role in disease severity and lethality of the infection. Macrophages are innate immune cells that sense and respond to infections by producing a plethora of inflammatory molecules and by interacting with other inflammatory cells. Therefore, macrophages may be diriment on eliminating pathogens and promoting organ repair. However, macrophages can be a major player of the so called cytokine storm and may be damaging to the tissues. It is believed that macrophage activation syndrome is induced by SARS-CoV to be lethal. Surprisingly and fortunately few children die from COVID-19. For instance, in Italy, out of more than 30.000 deaths for COVID-19, three are children. Therefore, we must wonder why? Are macrophages different in children compared to adults? In my opinion they are different. It has been demonstrated that macrophages populate the lung in three ""developmental waves"", and it has been suggested that similar waves may be observed in other important organs, such as the heart and kidney. It is most likely that macrophages heterogeneity is involved in determining the severity. There are no doubts that macrophages are important in determining life or death in these patients. Comparing macrophages of children with those of adults with different degrees of disease severity is, therefore, mandatory.","Pagliaro, Pasquale",Med Hypotheses,,671

HS GAGs display a wide range of critical biological functions, particularly in cell signaling. HS is composed of repeating units of 1 â 4 glucosidically linked uronic acid and glucosamine residues. Heparin, a pharmacologically important version of HS, having higher sulfation and a higher content of iduronic acid than HS, is a widely used clinical anticoagulant. However, due to their heterogeneity and complex structure, HS and heparin are very challenging to analyze, limiting biological studies and even resulting in safety concerns in their therapeutic application. Therefore, reliable methods of structural analysis of HS and heparin are critically needed. In addition to the structural analysis of heparin, its concentration in blood needs to be closely monitored to avoid complications such as thrombocytopenia or hemorrhage caused by heparin overdose. This review summarizes the progress in biotechnological approaches in the structural characterization of HS and heparin over the past decade and includes the development of the ultrasensitive approaches for detection and measurement in biological samples.","Qiao, Meng; Lin, Lei; Xia, Ke; Li, Jun; Zhang, Xing; Linhardt, Robert J",Talanta,,671

We used 6654 small molecules in molecular docking and top-50 docking scored compounds were initially used in short (10-ns) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Based on average MM/GBSA binding free energy results, long (100-ns) MD simulations were employed for the identified hits. Both binding energy results as well as crucial residues in ligand binding were also compared with a positive control TMPRSS2 inhibitor, Camostat mesylate. Based on these numerical calculations we proposed a compound (benzquercin) as strong TMPRSS2 inhibitor. If these results can be validated by in vitro and in vivo studies, benzquercin can be considered to be used as inhibitor of TMPRSS2 at the clinical studies.","Durdaği, Serdar",Turk. J. Biol.,,671

370187,Palbociclib,2020,"BackgroundIdentifying and testing individuals likely to have SARS-CoV-2 is critical for infection control, including post-vaccination. Vaccination is a major public health strategy to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection globally. Some individuals experience systemic symptoms post-vaccination, which overlap with COVID-19 symptoms. This study compared early post-vaccination symptoms in individuals who subsequently tested positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2, using data from the COVID Symptom Study (CSS) app. DesignWe conducted a prospective observational study in UK CSS participants who were asymptomatic when vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) or Oxford-AstraZeneca adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) between 8 December 2020 and 17 May 2021, who subsequently reported symptoms within seven days (other than local symptoms at injection site) and were tested for SARS-CoV-2, aiming to differentiate vaccination side-effects per se from superimposed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The post-vaccination symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 test results were contemporaneously logged by participants. Demographic and clinical information (including comorbidities) were also recorded. Symptom profiles in individuals testing positive were compared with a 1:1 matched population testing negative, including using machine learning and multiple models including UK testing criteria. FindingsDifferentiating post-vaccination side-effects alone from early COVID-19 was challenging, with a sensitivity in identification of individuals testing positive of 0.6 at best. A majority of these individuals did not have fever, persistent cough, or anosmia/dysosmia, requisite symptoms for accessing UK testing; and many only had systemic symptoms commonly seen post-vaccination in individuals negative for SARS-CoV-2 (headache, myalgia, and fatigue). InterpretationPost-vaccination side-effects per se cannot be differentiated from COVID-19 with clinical robustness, either using symptom profiles or machine-derived models. Individuals presenting with systemic symptoms post-vaccination should be tested for SARS-CoV-2, to prevent community spread.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThere are now multiple surveillance platforms internationally interrogating COVID-19 and/or post-vaccination side-effects. We designed a study to examine for differences between vaccination side-effects and early symptoms of COVID-19. We searched PubMed for peer-reviewed articles published between 1 January 2020 and 21 June 2021, using keywords: ""COVID-19"" AND ""Vaccination"" AND (""mobile application"" OR ""web tool"" OR ""digital survey"" OR ""early detection"" OR ""Self-reported symptoms"" OR ""side-effects""). Of 185 results, 25 studies attempted to differentiate symptoms of COVID-19 vs. post-vaccination side-effects; however, none used artificial intelligence (AI) technologies (""machine learning"") coupled with real-time data collection that also included comprehensive and systematic symptom assessment. Additionally, none of these studies attempt to discriminate the early signs of infection from side-effects of vaccination (specifically here: Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) and Oxford-AstraZeneca adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19)). Further, none of these studies sought to provide comparisons with current testing criteria used by healthcare services. Added value of this studyThis study, in a uniquely large community-based cohort, uses prospective data capture in a novel effort to identify individuals with COVID-19 in the immediate post-vaccination period. Our results show that early symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be differentiated from vaccination side-effects robustly. Thus, post-vaccination systemic symptoms should not be ignored, and testing should be considered to prevent COVID-19 dissemination by vaccinated individuals. Implications of all the available evidenceOur study demonstrates the critical importance of testing symptomatic individuals - even if vaccinated - to ensure early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to prevent future pandemic waves in the UK and elsewhere.","Canas, Liane S; Osterdahl, Marc F.; Deng, Jie; Hu, Christina; Selvachandran, Somesh; Polidori, Lorenzo; May, Anna; Molteni, Erika; Murray, Benjamin; Chen, Liyuan; Kerfoot, Eric; Klaser, Kerstin; Antonelli, Michela; Hammers, Alexander; Spector, Tim; Ourselin, Sebastien; Steves, Claire J.; Sudre, Carole H.; Modat, Marc; Duncan, Emma L.",,,671

Data harmonization is a key challenge in seamless use of multisite EHRs for COVID-19 research. We developed a COVID-19 application ontology in the national Accrual to Clinical Trials (ACT) network that enables harmonization of data elements that are critical to COVID-19 research. The ontology contains over 50 000 concepts in the domains of diagnosis, procedures, medications, and laboratory tests. In particular, it has computational phenotypes to characterize the course of illness and outcomes, derived terms, and harmonized value sets for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 laboratory tests. The ontology was deployed and validated on the ACT COVID-19 network that consists of 9 academic health centers with data on 14.5M patients. This ontology, which is freely available to the entire research community on GitHub at https://github.com/shyamvis/ACT-COVID-Ontology, will be useful for harmonizing EHRs for COVID-19 research beyond the ACT network.","Visweswaran, S.; Samayamuthu, M.

This round presents common-unit or purchasing-power-parity data for 176 countries on Gross Domestic Product and its components. We review a number of important issues, what is new, what is not new, and what the new data can and cannot do. Of great importance is the lack of news, that the results are broadly in line with earlier results from 2011. We consider the relationship between national accounts measures and health, particularly in light of the COVID-19 epidemic which may reduce global inequality, even as it increases inequality within countries. We emphasize things that GDP cannot do, some familiar-like its silence on distribution-and some less familiar-including its increasing detachment from national material well-being in a globalized world where international transfers of capital and property rights can have enormous effects on GDP, such as the 26 percent increase in Ireland's GDP in 2015.","Deaton, A.; Schreyer, P.",Review of Income and Wealth,,671
522066,Immunosuppressants,2021,"Here, we addressed the pharmacology and toxicology of synthetic organoselenium compounds and some naturally occurring organoselenium amino acids. The use of selenium as a tool in organic synthesis and as a pharmacological agent goes back to the middle of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. The rediscovery of ebselen and its investigation in clinical trials have motivated the search for new organoselenium molecules with pharmacological properties. Although ebselen and diselenides have some overlapping pharmacological properties, their molecular targets are not identical. However, they have similar anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, possibly, via activation of transcription factors, regulating the expression of antioxidant genes. In short, our knowledge about the pharmacological properties of simple organoselenium compounds is still elusive. However, contrary to our early expectations that they could imitate selenoproteins, organoselenium compounds seem to have non-specific modulatory activation of antioxidant pathways and specific inhibitory effects in some thiol-containing proteins. The thiol-oxidizing properties of organoselenium compounds are considered the molecular basis of their chronic toxicity; however, the acute use of organoselenium compounds as inhibitors of specific thiol-containing enzymes can be of therapeutic significance. In summary, the outcomes of the clinical trials of ebselen as a mimetic of lithium or as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 proteases will be important to the field of organoselenium synthesis. The development of computational techniques that could predict rational modifications in the structure of organoselenium compounds to increase their specificity is required to construct a library of thiol-modifying agents with selectivity toward specific target proteins.","Nogueira, Cristina W; Barbosa, Nilda V; Rocha, João B T",Arch Toxicol,,671

Of 22,647 participants, 22.5% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2–specific antibodies. Seroprevalence for police and firefighters was similar to overall seroprevalence; seroprevalence was highest in correctional staff (39.2%) and emergency medical technicians (38.3%) and lowest in laboratory technicians (10.1%) and medicolegal death investigators (10.8%). Adjusted analyses demonstrated association between seropositivity and exposure to SARS-CoV-2–positive household members (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.52 [95% CI 3.19–3.87]), non-Hispanic Black race or ethnicity (aOR 1.50 [95% CI 1.33–1.68]), and severe obesity (aOR 1.31 [95% CI 1.05–1.65]). Consistent glove use (aOR 1.19 [95% CI 1.06–1.33]) increased likelihood of seropositivity; use of other personal protective equipment had no association.

637145,Endovascular cerebral aneurysm treatment volume during coronavirus 2019.,2021-09-13,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Cancer patients undergoing active treatment may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 due to the effects of the malignant disease and the anti-cancer treatment. Assessing COVID-19 vaccine efficacy in protecting these patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection, is important due to the worldwide pandemic reaching an unprecedented third surge. Cancer patients on active neoplastic treatment had a reduced antibody response following immunization with the BNT162b2 vaccine, manifested as significantly more seronegative results and lower antibody levels compared with those of non-cancer individuals. The risk of a negative serological response was 7.35 times higher in patients on active anticancer treatment. This impaired serological response was mostly attributed to chemotherapy treatment. Cancer patients receiving non-chemotherapy treatments had a similar serologic response as those without cancer. Vaccinated cancer patients treated with chemotherapy might not be protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection and may need to continue exercising precautionary measures such as social distancing and facial masking. ABSTRACT: The BNT162b2 vaccine was shown to be highly effective in reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection in healthy individuals and patients with chronic disease. However, there are little data regarding its efficacy in patients treated for cancer. We analyzed the humoral response following vaccination with the second dose of BNT162b2 in 140 patients with solid malignancies who were receiving anti-cancer therapy at the time of vaccination and 215 participants who had not been diagnosed with cancer. Multivariate analysis was performed, followed by matching the two groups by age, gender and days from vaccination. The humoral response in the cancer patient group was significantly lower than in the non-cancer group: 20/140 seronegative (14.3%) vs. 3/215 (1.4%), p < 0.001; median IgG levels 2231 AU/mL (IQR 445-8023) vs. 4100 (IQR 2231-6774) p = 0.001 respectively. The odds ratio for negative serology results in cancer patients adjusted by age and gender was 7.35 compared to participants without cancer. This effect was observed only in chemotherapy treated patients: 17/73 seronegative (23.3%) vs. 3/215 (1.4%), p < 0.001; median IgG 1361 AU/mL vs. 4100, p < 0.001 but not in patients treated with non-chemotherapeutic drugs. Reduced immunogenicity to COVID-19 vaccine among chemotherapy-treated cancer patients, raises the need to continue exercising protective measures after vaccination in these patients.","Agbarya, Abed; Sarel, Ina; Ziv-Baran, Tomer; Agranat, Sivan; Schwartz, Orna; Shai, Ayelet; Nordheimer, Sharon; Fenig, Shlomit; Shechtman, Yelena; Kozlener, Ella; Taha, Tarek; Nasrallah, Haitam; Parikh, Roma; Elkoshi, Nadav; Levy, Carmit; Khoury, Rasha; Brenner, Ronen",Cancers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13164191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34439346/,671
