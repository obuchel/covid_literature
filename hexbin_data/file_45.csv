59,59,59,Transmission patterns of smallpox: systematic review of natural outbreaks in Europe and North America since World War II,21.04936,1.6081914,2006-05-05,"BACKGROUND: Because smallpox (variola major) may be used as a biological weapon, we reviewed outbreaks in post-World War II Europe and North America in order to understand smallpox transmission patterns. METHODS: A systematic review was used to identify papers from the National Library of Medicine, Embase, Biosis, Cochrane Library, Defense Technical Information Center, WorldCat, and reference lists of included publications. Two authors reviewed selected papers for smallpox outbreaks. RESULTS: 51 relevant outbreaks were identified from 1,389 publications. The median for the effective first generation reproduction rate (initial R) was 2 (range 0–38). The majority outbreaks were small (less than 5 cases) and contained within one generation. Outbreaks with few hospitalized patients had low initial R values (median of 1) and were prolonged if not initially recognized (median of 3 generations); outbreaks with mostly hospitalized patients had higher initial R values (median 12) and were shorter (median of 3 generations). Index cases with an atypical presentation of smallpox were less likely to have been diagnosed with smallpox; outbreaks in which the index case was not correctly diagnosed were larger (median of 27.5 cases) and longer (median of 3 generations) compared to outbreaks in which the index case was correctly diagnosed (median of 3 cases and 1 generation). CONCLUSION: Patterns of spread during Smallpox outbreaks varied with circumstances, but early detection and implementation of control measures is a most important influence on the magnitude of outbreaks. The majority of outbreaks studied in Europe and North America were controlled within a few generations if detected early.","Bhatnagar, Vibha; Stoto, Michael A; Morton, Sally C; Boer, Rob; Bozzette, Samuel A",BMC Public Health,45,30
165,165,165,"Gatekeepers of health: A qualitative assessment of child care centre staff's perspectives, practices and challenges to enteric illness prevention and management in child care centres",20.973076,1.7446388,2008-06-13,"BACKGROUND: Enteric outbreaks associated with child care centres (CCC) have been well documented internationally and in Canada. The current literature focuses on identifying potential risk factors for introduction and transmission of enteric disease, but does not examine why these risk factors happen, how the risk is understood and managed by the staff of CCCs, or what challenges they experience responding to enteric illness. The purpose of this study was to explore the understanding, knowledge and actions of CCC staff regarding enteric illness and outbreaks, and to identify challenges that staff encounter while managing them. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with staff of regulated CCCs in Southern Ontario. Five focus groups were held with 40 participants. An open ended style of interviewing was used. Data were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: CCC staff play an important role in preventing and managing enteric illness. Staff used in-depth knowledge of the children, the centre and their personal experiences to assist in making decisions related to enteric illness. The decisions and actions may differ from guidance provided by public health officials, particularly when faced with challenges related to time, money, staffing and parents. CONCLUSION: CCC staff relied on experience and judgment in coordination with public health information to assist decision-making in the management of enteric illness and outbreaks. Advice and guidance from public health officials to CCC staff needs to be consistent yet flexible so that it may be adapted in a variety of situations and meet regulatory and public health requirements.","Taylor, Marsha; Adams, Cindy L; Ellis, Andrea",BMC Public Health,45,5
730,730,730,"Making sense of perceptions of risk of diseases and vaccinations: a qualitative study combining models of health beliefs, decision-making and risk perception",21.126799,1.667388,2011-12-20,"BACKGROUND: Maintaining high levels of childhood vaccinations is important for public health. Success requires better understanding of parents' perceptions of diseases and consequent decisions about vaccinations, however few studies have considered this from the theoretical perspectives of risk perception and decision-making under uncertainty. The aim of this study was to examine the utility of subjective risk perception and decision-making theories to provide a better understanding of the differences between immunisers' and non-immunisers' health beliefs and behaviours. METHODS: In a qualitative study we conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with 45 Australian parents exploring their experiences and perceptions of disease severity and susceptibility. Using scenarios about 'a new strain of flu' we explored how risk information was interpreted. RESULTS: We found that concepts of dread, unfamiliarity, and uncontrollability from the subjective perception of risk and ambiguity, optimistic control and omission bias from explanatory theories of decision-making under uncertainty were useful in understanding why immunisers, incomplete immunisers and non-immunisers interpreted severity and susceptibility to diseases and vaccine risk differently. Immunisers dreaded unfamiliar diseases whilst non-immunisers dreaded unknown, long term side effects of vaccines. Participants believed that the risks of diseases and complications from diseases are not equally spread throughout the community, therefore, when listening to reports of epidemics, it is not the number of people who are affected but the familiarity or unfamiliarity of the disease and the characteristics of those who have had the disease that prompts them to take preventive action. Almost all believed they themselves would not be at serious risk of the 'new strain of flu' but were less willing to take risks with their children's health. CONCLUSION: This study has found that health messages about the risks of disease which are communicated as though there is equality of risk in the population may be unproductive as these messages are perceived as unbelievable or irrelevant. The findings from this study have implications beyond the issue of childhood vaccinations as we grapple with communicating risks of new epidemics, and indeed may usefully contribute to the current debate especially in the UK of how these theories of risk and decision-making can be used to 'nudge' other health behaviours.","Bond, Lyndal; Nolan, Terry",BMC Public Health,45,30
1554,1554,1554,The niche reduction approach: an opportunity for optimal control of infectious diseases in low-income countries?,21.140186,1.7532123,2014-07-25,"BACKGROUND: During the last century, WHO led public health interventions that resulted in spectacular achievements such as the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the elimination of malaria from the Western world. However, besides major successes achieved worldwide in infectious diseases control, most elimination/control programs remain frustrating in many tropical countries where specific biological and socio-economical features prevented implementation of disease control over broad spatial and temporal scales. Emblematic examples include malaria, yellow fever, measles and HIV. There is consequently an urgent need to develop affordable and sustainable disease control strategies that can target the core of infectious diseases transmission in highly endemic areas. DISCUSSION: Meanwhile, although most pathogens appear so difficult to eradicate, it is surprising to realize that human activities are major drivers of the current high rate of extinction among upper organisms through alteration of their ecology and evolution, i.e., their “niche”. During the last decades, the accumulation of ecological and evolutionary studies focused on infectious diseases has shown that the niche of a pathogen holds more dimensions than just the immune system targeted by vaccination and treatment. Indeed, it is situated at various intra- and inter- host levels involved on very different spatial and temporal scales. After developing a precise definition of the niche of a pathogen, we detail how major advances in the field of ecology and evolutionary biology of infectious diseases can enlighten the planning and implementation of infectious diseases control in tropical countries with challenging economic constraints. SUMMARY: We develop how the approach could translate into applied cases, explore its expected benefits and constraints, and we conclude on the necessity of such approach for pathogen control in low-income countries.","Roche, Benjamin; Broutin, Hélène; Choisy, Marc; Godreuil, Sylvain; de Magny, Guillaume Constantin; Chevaleyre, Yann; Zucker, Jean-Daniel; Breban, Romulus; Cazelles, Bernard; Simard, Frédéric",BMC Public Health,45,30
1579,1579,1579,Progress and challenges of disaster health management in China: a scoping review,20.917181,1.8314046,2014-09-10,"BACKGROUND: Despite the importance of an effective health system response to various disasters, relevant research is still in its infancy, especially in middle- and low-income countries. OBJECTIVE: This paper provides an overview of the status of disaster health management in China, with its aim to promote the effectiveness of the health response for reducing disaster-related mortality and morbidity. DESIGN: A scoping review method was used to address the recent progress of and challenges to disaster health management in China. Major health electronic databases were searched to identify English and Chinese literature that were relevant to the research aims. RESULTS: The review found that since 2003 considerable progress has been achieved in the health disaster response system in China. However, there remain challenges that hinder effective health disaster responses, including low standards of disaster-resistant infrastructure safety, the lack of specific disaster plans, poor emergency coordination between hospitals, lack of portable diagnostic equipment and underdeveloped triage skills, surge capacity, and psychological interventions. Additional challenges include the fragmentation of the emergency health service system, a lack of specific legislation for emergencies, disparities in the distribution of funding, and inadequate cost-effective considerations for disaster rescue. CONCLUSIONS: One solution identified to address these challenges appears to be through corresponding policy strategies at multiple levels (e.g. community, hospital, and healthcare system level).","Zhong, Shuang; Clark, Michele; Hou, Xiang-Yu; Zang, Yuli; FitzGerald, Gerard",Glob Health Action,45,5
3589,3589,3589,Mental health workers perceptions of disaster response in China,21.13544,1.5522599,2019-01-03,"BACKGROUND: The post-disaster mental health crisis intervention (MHCI) system in China remains immature and unsystematic. We aim to report the perceptions of a large sample of MHCI workers and government administrators and provide recommendations for developing a national mental health disaster response management plan in China. METHODS: An in-depth qualitative study was conducted, collecting data from 20 focus-group discussions and 25 key stakeholder interviews. These recruited participants who had been involved in different types of disaster rescue across 7 provinces/cities where disasters have recently occurred. We used thematic analysis to analyze the data and relevant findings were extracted for policy recommendation. RESULTS: Mental health workers’ perspectives were examined in detailed according to four core themes: forms of organization, intervention pathway, intervention strategy and technique, and public health information. Post-disaster MHCI should be approached in teams that are integrated with emergency medicine systems, and be led by unified command management. All levels of local health and family planning commission should prepare post-disaster MHCI work plans and build response teams/emergency centres. Future training for MHCI workers should focus on: building a sense of trust within the team; clarifying each member’s role; strengthening the screening, assessment and referrals training for psychological professionals; and providing psychological intervention training for Chinese psychiatrists. It is necessary to set up guiding principles for disaster research ethics, mental health rehabilitation and media interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Through exploring and analyzing the perceptions of current disaster response mental health workers and government administrators, our findings provide essential recommendations for developing a national to county level post-disaster MHCI emergency management plan and can guide the formulation of relevant laws and regulation in China.

3803,3803,3803,‘Tiny Iceland’ preparing for Ebola in a globalized world,20.931332,1.6106718,2019-05-07,"Background: The Ebola epidemic in West Africa caused global fear and stirred up worldwide preparedness activities in countries sharing borders with those affected, and in geographically far-away countries such as Iceland. Objective: To describe and analyse Ebola preparedness activities within the Icelandic healthcare system, and to explore the perspectives and experiences of managers and frontline health workers. Methods: A qualitative case study, based on semi-structured interviews with 21 staff members in the national Ebola Treatment Team, Emergency Room at Landspitali University Hospital, and managers of the response team. Results: Contextual factors such as culture and demography influenced preparedness, and contributed to the positive state of mind of participants, and ingenuity in using available resources for preparedness. While participants believed they were ready to take on the task of Ebola, they also had doubts about the chances of Ebola ever reaching Iceland. Yet, factors such as fear of Ebola and the perceived stigma associated with caring for a potentially infected Ebola patient, influenced the preparation process and resulted in plans for specific precautions by staff to secure the safety of their families. There were also concerns about the teamwork and lack of commitment by some during training. Being a ‘tiny’ nation was seen as both an asset and a weakness in the preparation process. Honest information sharing and scenario-based training contributed to increased confidence amongst participants in the response plans. Conclusions: Communication and training were important for preparedness of health staff in Iceland, in order to receive, admit, and treat a patient suspected of having Ebola, while doubts prevailed on staff capacity to properly do so. For optimal preparedness, likely scenarios for future global security health threats need to be repeatedly enacted, and areas plagued by poverty and fragile healthcare systems require global support.","Gunnlaugsson, Geir; Hauksdóttir, Íris Eva; Bygbjerg, Ib Christian; Pinkowski Tersbøl, Britt",Glob Health Action,45,5

In this review, we discuss the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, management strategy, and clinical outcomes of cardiopulmonary failure (CPF) in patients with EV-A71 infection. The pathogenesis of CPF involves both catecholamine-related cardiotoxicity following brainstem encephalitis and vasodilatory shock due to cytokine storm. Sympathetic hyperactivity, including tachycardia and hypertension, are the early clinical manifestations of cardiopulmonary involvement, which may progress to pulmonary edema/hemorrhage and/or CPF. The management strategy comprises multidisciplinary supportive treatment, including fluid management, positive pressure ventilation support, and use of milrinone, vasopressors, and inotropes. Some patients may require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Major neurological sequelae are almost inevitable once a child develops life-threatening illness.

The disparities in breastfeeding support across Chicagoland are symptomatic of inequitable health care access shaped by persisting structural racism. A number of community hospitals that once served AA families by providing easy access to care no longer exist. Recently, South Side obstetric unit and hospital closures have increased. Simultaneously, funding is increasingly competitive for community health organizations and federally qualified health centers. Institutions and agencies that do receive funding or adequately allocate funding to include lactation services cannot address breastfeeding barriers within socioeconomically marginalized communities. The unmet funding needs not only affect breastfeeding families but also impede the growth of a multilevel lactation care workforce. Finally, inconsistencies persist between breastfeeding information provided by lactation providers and delivery team care received in the hospital. Despite these barriers, we believe pathways exist to improve breastfeeding rates among South Side AA communities, such as perinatal home visiting services. Stakeholders must recognize the longstanding effects of structural racism and address the inequitable distribution of perinatal care across Chicagoland. Stakeholders must also place value in and be supportive of lactation care providers and the families they serve through both funding and policies. These changes, in addition to community-level collaboration, can improve breastfeeding rates for AA families on Chicagoland's South Side.","Butler, Margaret; Allen, Jo Ann; Hoskins-Wroten, Jacqueline; Sanders-Bey, Tytina; Venegas, Ruth Nydia; Webb, Irene; Ragland, Kathryn",Breastfeed Med,45,30

However, evidence of the impact of preoperative frailty on short-term postoperative outcomes or functional recovery is limited. This retrospective study included 234 consecutive patients with severe AS who underwent SAVR or TAVR at Kobe University Hospital between Dec 2013 and Dec 2019. Primary outcomes were postoperative complications, postoperative 6-min walking distance (6MWD), and home discharge rates. The mean age was 82 ± 6.6 years. There were 169 (SAVR: 80, TAVR: 89) and 65 (SAVR: 20, TAVR: 45) patients in the non-frail and frail groups, respectively (p = 0.02). The postoperative complication rates in the frail group were significantly higher than those in the non-frail group [30.8% (SAVR: 35.0%, TAVR: 28.9%) vs. 10.7% (SAVR: 15.0%, TAVR: 6.7%), p < 0.001].

Recent evidence suggests that exploring socioeconomic status (SES), health and lifestyle-related factors might contribute to a better understanding of road traffic crashes (RTCs). Thus, the aim of this study was to construct indices for the assessment of crash rates and mobility patterns among young Colombians who live in the central region of the country. The specific objectives were developing SES, health and lifestyle indices, and assessing the self-reported RTCs and mobility features depending on these indices. A sample of 561 subjects participated in this cross-sectional study. Through a reduction approach of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), three indices were constructed. Mean and frequency differences were contrasted for the self-reported mobility, crash rates, age, and gender. As a result, SES, health and lifestyle indices explained between 56.3–67.9% of the total variance. Drivers and pedestrians who suffered crashes had higher SES. A healthier lifestyle is associated with cycling, but also with suffering more bike crashes; drivers and those reporting traffic crashes have shown greater psychosocial and lifestyle-related risk factors. Regarding gender differences, men are more likely to engage in road activities, as well as to suffer more RTCs. On the other hand, women present lower healthy lifestyle-related indices and a less active implication in mobility. Protective factors such as a high SES and a healthier lifestyle are associated with RTCs suffered by young Colombian road users. Given the differences found in this regard, a gender perspective for understanding RTCs and mobility is highly suggestible, considering that socio-economic gaps seem to differentially affect mobility and crash-related patterns.","Serge, Andrea; Quiroz Montoya, Johana; Alonso, Francisco; Montoro, Luis",Int J Environ Res Public Health,45,30

In 2019, the Geneva AD Biomarker Roadmap Initiative included blood biomarkers in the systematic validation of AD biomarkers. METHODS: A panel of experts convened in November 2019 at a two-day workshop in Geneva. The level of maturity (fully achieved, partly achieved, preliminary evidence, not achieved, unsuccessful) of blood biomarkers was assessed based on the Biomarker Roadmap methodology and discussed fully during the workshop which also evaluated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers. RESULTS: Plasma p-tau has shown analytical validity (phase 2 primary aim 1) and first evidence of clinical validity (phase 3 primary aim 1), whereas the maturity level for Aβ remains to be partially achieved. Full and partial achievement has been assigned to p-tau and Aβ, respectively, in their associations to ante-mortem measures (phase 2 secondary aim 2). However, only preliminary evidence exists for the influence of covariates, assay comparison and cut-off criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relative infancy of blood biomarkers, in comparison to CSF biomarkers, much has already been achieved for phases 1 through 3 – with p-tau having greater success in detecting AD and predicting disease progression. However, sufficient data about the effect of covariates on the biomarker measurement is lacking. No phase 4 (real-world performance) or phase 5 (assessment of impact/cost) aim has been tested, thus not achieved.","Ashton, N. J.; Leuzy, A.; Karikari, T.

Amphibian chytrid fungi and the viruses of the Ranavirus genus are causing disease outbreaks worldwide, including in protected areas such as National Parks. However, we lack information about their effect over amphibian populations in the long-term, and sometimes these mortality episodes are considered as transient events without serious consequences over longer time-spans. Here, we relate the occurrence of both pathogens with the population trends of 24 amphibian populations at 15 sites across a national Park in northern Spain over a 14-year period. Just one out 24 populations presents a positive population trend being free of both pathogens, while seven populations exposed to one or two pathogens experienced strong declines during the study period. The rest of the study populations (16) remain stable, and these tend to be of species that are not susceptible to the pathogen present or are free of pathogens. Our study is consistent with infectious diseases playing an important role in dictating amphibian population trends and emphasizes the need to adopt measures to control these pathogens in nature. We highlight that sites housing species carrying Ranavirus seems to have experienced more severe population-level effects compared to those with the amphibian chytrid fungus, and that ranaviruses could be just as, or more important, other more high-profile amphibian emerging pathogens.","Bosch, Jaime; Mora-Cabello de Alba, Amparo; Marquínez, Susana; Price, Stephen J.; Thumsová, Barbora; Bielby, Jon",Front Vet Sci,45,30

However, the mechanisms underlying platelet hyperactivity in CD are not well understood. We investigated the assembly of platelet NLRP3 inflammasome in patients with active CD and its correlation with platelet hyperactivity. In this study, Real-time PCR and western blotting analyses uncovered that ASC, NLRP3, and active caspase-1 were significantly upregulated in platelets from patients with active CD compared with healthy subjects. As revealed by flow cytometry (FCM) and ELISA analyses, the levels of interleukin-1β in both serum and isolated platelets were elevated in patients with active CD. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments revealed an increased assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome in platelets from patients with active CD. In addition, higher levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were observed in these platelets by FCM. Furthermore, elevated levels of platelet P-selectin exposure and fibrinogen binding were demonstrated in patients with active CD by FCM. They were positively correlated with the protein levels of NLRP3 inflammasome components. Collectively, our results indicate that the ROS-NLRP3 inflammasome-interleukin-1β axis may contribute to platelet hyperactivity in active CD.","Zhang, Ge; Chen, He; Guo, Yifan; Zhang, Wei; Jiang, Qiuyu; Zhang, Si; Han, Liping; Chen, She; Xue, Ruyi",Front Pharmacol,45,5

20615,20615,20615,COVID-19:: An impasse between livelihood and health,20.730995,1.6322526,2020-08-13,"BACKGROUND: Since 2010, large reductions in funding for local government services have been introduced in England. These reductions in funding have potentially led to reduced provision of health-promoting public services. We aimed to investigate whether areas that showed a greater decline in funding also had more adverse trends in life expectancy and premature mortality. METHODS: In this longitudinal ecological study, we linked annual data from the Ministry of Housing, Communities, and Local Government on local government revenue expenditure and financing to 147 upper-tier local authorities in England between 2013 and 2017 with data from Public Health England, on male and female life expectancy at birth, male and female life expectancy at age 65 years, and premature (younger than 75 years) all-cause mortality rate for male and female individuals. Local authorities were excluded if their populations were too small or if changes in boundaries meant consistent data were not available. Using multivariable fixed-effects panel regression models, and controlling for local socioeconomic conditions, we estimated whether changes in local funding from 2013 were associated with changes in life expectancy and premature mortality. We included a set of alternative model specifications to test the robustness of our findings. FINDINGS: Between 2013 and 2017, mean per-capita central funding to local governments decreased by 33% or £168 per person (range –£385 to £1). Each £100 reduction in annual per person funding was associated over the study period 2013–17 with an average decrease in life expectancy at birth of 1·3 months (95% CI 0·7–1·9) for male individuals and 1·2 months (0·7–1·7) for female individuals; for life expectancy at age 65 years, the results show a decrease of 0·8 months (0·3–1·3) for male individuals and 1·1 months (0·7–1·5) for female individuals. Funding reductions were greater in more deprived areas and these areas had the worst changes in life expectancy. We estimated that cuts in funding were associated with an increase in the gap in life expectancy between the most and least deprived quintiles by 3% for men and 4% for women. Overall reductions in funding during this period were associated with an additional 9600 deaths in people younger than 75 years in England (3800–15 400), an increase of 1·25%. INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that cuts in funding for local government might in part explain adverse trends in life expectancy. Given that more deprived areas showed greater reductions in funding, our analysis suggests that inequalities have widened. Since the pandemic, strategies to address these adverse trends in life expectancy and reduce health inequalities could prioritise reinvestment in funding for local government services, particularly within the most deprived areas of England.

However, promoting psychological well-being among adolescents is often neglected despite significant short-term and long-term benefits. OBJECTIVE: This research has 3 main objectives: (1) to assess the acceptability of Match Emoji, a casual video game with psychological well-being concepts among 13-15-year-old students in a New Zealand secondary school; (2) to identify the feasibility of the research process; and (3) to explore the preliminary well-being and therapeutic potential of Match Emoji. METHODS: Approximately 40 participants aged 13-15 years from a local secondary college in Wellington, New Zealand, will be invited to download and play Match Emoji 3-4 times a week for 5-15 minutes over a 2-week period. Participants will complete 4 assessments at baseline, postintervention, and 3 weeks later to assess psychological well-being and therapeutic changes. Statistical analysis will be used to synthesize data from interviews and triangulated with assessment changes and game analytics. This synthesis will help to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the Match Emoji. RESULTS: The key outputs from the project will include the acceptability, feasibility, and therapeutic potential of Match Emoji. It is anticipated that participants will have finished playing the recommended game play regimen by August 2021 with analysis of results completed by October 2021. CONCLUSIONS: Data from the study are expected to inform future research on Match Emoji including a randomized controlled trial and further adjustments to the design and development of the game.

Currently, GA is mainly extracted from the roots of cultivated licorice. However, licorice only contains low amounts of GA, and the amount of licorice that can be planted is limited. GA supplies are therefore limited and cannot meet the demands of growing markets. GA has a complex chemical structure, and its chemical synthesis is difficult, therefore, new strategies to produce large amounts of GA are needed. The development of metabolic engineering and emerging synthetic biology provide the opportunity to produce GA using microbial cell factories. In this review, current advances in the metabolic engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for GA biosynthesis and various metabolic engineering strategies that can improve GA production are summarized. Furthermore, the advances and challenges of yeast GA production are also discussed. In summary, GA biosynthesis using metabolically engineered S. cerevisiae serves as one possible strategy for sustainable GA supply and reasonable use of traditional Chinese medical plants.","Guan, Ruobing; Wang, Mengge; Guan, Zhonghua; Jin, Cheng-Yun; Lin, Wei; Ji, Xiao-Jun; Wei, Yongjun",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,45,24

An epidemiological study in Upper Egypt,21.037895,1.8550321,2021-03-05,"The adverse health effects of long and short-term exposure to ambient air pollutants are well established in the epidemiological literature. Amongst all pollutants, fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)), poses a significant mortality risk because of its toxicity and extensive human exposure. During COVID-19 lockdowns, numerous studies have reported a reduction in ambient PM(2.5) concentrations due to decreased anthropogenic activities. Therefore, potential health benefits are plausible during this period. In this pursuit, the current study aims to estimate the potential deaths that might have been avoided due to the reductions in PM(2.5) levels during COVID-19 lockdowns in India's 12 states. For the same, concentration–response functions are developed, and the changes in PM(2.5) levels were calculated. Overall, PM(2.5) levels in the analysed states decreased by an average of 19.61 µg/m(3) (SD = 10.34 µg/m(3)) during the months of April–June 2020 compared to the previous year. The concentration–response coefficient (β) obtained for the Indian states is 0.02272 (0.01063–0.03481, 95% Confidence Interval). Upon using these values in the calculation, our analysis estimates that nearly 73,853–92,116 mortalities might have been avoided in the 12 analysed Indian states for the period of April–June 2020 due to the COVID-19 lockdown. Given the high levels of PM(2.5) in India with its well-known associated health risks and the results of this study, it is likely that the number of lives potentially saved during the COVID-19 lockdown due to reduced concentrations of PM(2.5) might surpass the COVID-19 deaths in the country.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel infectious process prompting hyperglycemic crisis. SARS-CoV-2 at the level of the lungs affects ACE2 functioning which in turns decrease the B cells proliferation at the pancreas and hinders insulin secretion. Advanced age and comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus are considered to be a risk factors for severe illness and mortality between patients with SARS-CoV-2. We present the case of a 39-year-old woman with medical history of uterine fibroma, who presented with complains of general malaise, polyuria and polydipsia of one week evolution, associated with sore throat, subjective fever, dry cough, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Physical examination remarkable for dry oral mucosa, decreased skin turgor, and prolonged capillary refills. Vital signs significant for hypertension, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Laboratory work up remarkable for glucose of 1321 mg/dL, HCO3- of 16 mEq/L, serum osmolality of 333 mOsm/kg, serum ketones positive and HbA1C of 15%. ABG’s showed pH of 7.33, PCO2 of 29.8 and a PAO2 of 158.5 mmHg for a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AG of 15.3 mEq/L), non-anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis.

Clinical and laboratory workup met criteria for diagnosis of HHS and Diabetes Mellitus de Novo most likely secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patient was treated with aggressive IV hydration and insulin infusion with resolution of hyperglycemia, ketonemia and symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 infection can precipitate acute metabolic complications in patients with diabetes or unknown diagnosis of diabetes. The effect of the virus could be direct effect on β-cell function. To our knowledge, there are only a few cases reported of HHS precipitated by SARS-CoV-2 infection therefore medical awareness is important for early diagnosis of possible triggering factors such as COVID-19 and early management of patients presenting with new onset hyperglycemic emergencies.","Rivera Nazario, Ivan Augusto; Ortiz, Arnaldo Nieves; Rivera, Jose Ayala; Moya, Kyomara Hernandez; Rojas, Arnaldo; Lopez, Zahira Marie Lugo; Torres, Marina Torres; Cintron-Colon, Hector R; Fonseca, Vanessa; Bisono, Nicolas Cabrera; Miranda, Maria De Lourdes",J Endocr Soc,45,12

As a country undergoing profound societal change, China faces growing challenges to reduce the disease burden caused by psychiatric disorders. In this review, we aim to present an overview of progress in neuroscience research and clinical services for psychiatric disorders in China during the past three decades, analysing contributing factors and potential challenges to the field development. We first review studies in the epidemiological, genetic and neuroimaging fields as examples to illustrate a growing contribution of studies from China to the neuroscience research. Next, we introduce large-scale, open-access imaging genetic cohorts and recently initiated brain banks in China as platforms to study healthy brain functions and brain disorders. Then, we show progress in clinical services, including an integration of hospital and community-based healthcare systems and early intervention schemes. We finally discuss opportunities and existing challenges: achievements in research and clinical services are indispensable to the growing funding investment and continued engagement in international collaborations. The unique aspect of traditional Chinese medicine may provide insights to develop a novel treatment for psychiatric disorders. Yet obstacles still remain to promote research quality and to provide ubiquitous clinical services to vulnerable populations. Taken together, we expect to see a sustained advancement in psychiatric research and healthcare system in China.

A total of 1,188 adolescents (aged between 12 and 16 years) completed the Perceived Social Support from Family and Friends and Perception of the School Environment Questionnaires, the Trait Meta Mood Scale (TMMS), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 (CD-RISC), and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) for social support, emotion regulation, resilience, and life satisfaction. By applying structural equation modeling (SEM), the results reveal a direct prediction of family support, emotion regulation, and resilience on life satisfaction. Support from friends and emotion regulation was also found to explain resilience, and support from family and teachers was found to predict emotion regulation. In conclusion, emotion regulation and social support were found to indirectly affect life satisfaction among adolescents through resilience. The theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.","Azpiazu Izaguirre, Lorea; Fernández, Arantzazu Rodríguez; Palacios, Eider Goñi",Front Psychol,45,13

Our objective was to determine whether an in vitro model of ARDS can recapitulate the same AM functional defect observed in vivo and be used to further investigate pathophysiological mechanisms. Methods: AMs were isolated from the lung tissue of patients undergoing lobectomy and then treated with pooled bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid previously collected from patients with ARDS. AM phenotype and effector functions (efferocytosis and phagocytosis) were assessed by flow cytometry. Rac1 gene expression was assessed using quantitative real-time PCR. Results: ARDS BAL treatment of AMs decreased efferocytosis (p = 0.0006) and Rac1 gene expression (p = 0.016); however, bacterial phagocytosis was preserved. Expression of AM efferocytosis receptors MerTK (p = 0.015) and CD206 (p = 0.006) increased, whereas expression of the antiefferocytosis receptor SIRPα decreased following ARDS BAL treatment (p = 0.036). Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibition partially restored AM efferocytosis in an in vitro model of ARDS (p = 0.009). Conclusions: Treatment of lung resection tissue AMs with ARDS BAL fluid induces impairment in efferocytosis similar to that observed in patients with ARDS. However, AM phagocytosis is preserved following ARDS BAL treatment. This specific impairment in AM efferocytosis can be partially restored by inhibition of ROCK. This in vitro model of ARDS is a useful tool to investigate the mechanisms by which the inflammatory alveolar microenvironment of ARDS induces AM dysfunction.","Mahida, Rahul Y.; Scott, Aaron; Parekh, Dhruv; Lugg, Sebastian T.; Belchamber, Kylie B.

Their biological functions in and beyond innate immunity, structure and activity relationships, mechanisms of action, and therapeutic potential continue to be interesting research topics. This review examines recent progress in our understanding of alpha and theta-defensins - the two structural classes composed of members of myeloid origin. RECENT FINDINGS A novel mode of antibacterial action is described for human enteric alpha-defensin 6, which forms structured nanonets to entrap bacterial pathogens and protect against bacterial invasion of the intestinal epithelium. The functional multiplicity and mechanistic complexity of defensins under different experimental conditions contribute to a debate over the role of enteric alpha-defensins in mucosal immunity against HIV-1 infection. Contrary to common belief, hydrophobicity rather than cationicity plays a dominant functional role in the action of human alpha-defensins; hydrophobicity-mediated high-order assembly endows human alpha-defensins with an extraordinary ability to acquire structural diversity and functional versatility. Growing evidence suggests that theta-defensins offer the best opportunity for therapeutic development as a novel class of broadly active anti-infective and anti-inflammatory agents. SUMMARY Defensins are the 'Swiss army knife' in innate immunity against microbial pathogens. Their modes of action are often reminiscent of the story of 'The Blind Men and the Elephant'. The functional diversity and mechanistic complexity, as well as therapeutic potential of defensins, will continue to attract attention to this important family of antimicrobial peptides.","Zhao, Le; Lu, Wuyuan",Current opinion in hematology,45,1

A sacral anterior root stimulator at low frequency can drive volitional bladder voiding, but surgical rhizotomy of the lumbosacral dorsal roots is needed to prevent spontaneous voiding and dyssynergia. However, rhizotomy is irreversible and eliminates sexual function, and the stimulator gives no information on bladder fullness. We designed a closed-loop neuroprosthetic interface that measures bladder fullness and prevents spontaneous voiding episodes without the need for dorsal rhizotomy in a rat model. To obtain bladder sensory information, we implanted teased dorsal roots (rootlets) within the rat vertebral column into microchannel electrodes, which provided signal amplification and noise suppression. As long as they were attached to the spinal cord, these rootlets survived for up to 3 months and contained axons and blood vessels. Electrophysiological recordings showed that half of the rootlets propagated action potentials, with firing frequency correlated to bladder fullness. When the bladder became full enough to initiate spontaneous voiding, high-frequency/amplitude sensory activity was detected. Voiding was abolished using a high-frequency depolarizing block to the ventral roots. A ventral root stimulator initiated bladder emptying at low frequency and prevented unwanted contraction at high frequency. These data suggest that sensory information from the dorsal root together with a ventral root stimulator could form the basis for a closed-loop bladder neuroprosthetic.","Chew, Daniel J; Zhu, Lan; Delivopoulos, Evangelos; Minev, Ivan R; Musick, Katherine M; Mosse, Charles A; Craggs, Michael; Donaldson, Nicholas; Lacour, Stéphanie P; McMahon, Stephen B; Fawcett, James W",Science translational medicine,45,16

Background Angioedema (AE) is a non-pitting, non-itching swelling of skin or mucosa. The symptom can become life-threatening if located in the airways. Primary (monosymptomatic) AE is a manifestation of several different diseases and the diagnosis is not always straight-forward. The aetiological and pathophysiological factors of primary AE are not completely clarified. There is a need for further investigation. Patients and Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of patients referred to an outpatient dermatology clinic in a tertiary care hospital for clinical assessment due to primary AE in the period from 1996 to 2014. Results A total of 315 patients were identified with primary AE. The most frequent subtype was idiopathic AE (42.5%) and the second most common was angiotensin-converting enzymeinhibitor (ACEi)-induced AE (31.1%). Three patients were diagnosed with hereditary AE and one patient was diagnosed with acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency. At least 107 (34.0%) patients had established histaminergic AE. More than 1/3 of the patients were treated in an emergency room or hospitalized due to AE. A 98.1% of patients had experienced AE in the head and neck area. Seven patients were in the need of acute airway intervention. Six of these had ACEi-induced AE. Female sex and smoking were found to be risk factors for developing AE. Conclusion The most frequent diagnoses were histaminergic-, non-histaminergic idiopathic AE and ACEi-induced AE, whereas complement C1-inhibitor deficiency was rare. Histaminergic AE made up a substantial group of patients with primary AE. Even though there are different pathophysiological causes of AE, many cases have overlapping clinical manifestations, which make diagnosis and treatment difficult.","Pall, Amalie Hartvig; Lomholt, Anne Fog; von Buchwald, Christian; Bygum, Anette; Rasmussen, Eva Rye",Journal of asthma and allergy,45,1

DESIGN Randomized, crossover. METHODS Twelve athletes (mean[M] ± standard deviation[SD]; age, 20 ± 1 years; height, 174 ± 8 cm; body mass, 72.1 ± 11.0 kg; VO2max 53.9 ± 7.3 mL⋅kg-1⋅min-1) completed four trials (euhydrated without dousing, hypohydrated without dousing, euhydrated with dousing, and hypohydrated with dousing), which involved intermittent treadmill running (five 15-minute bouts) in the heat (M ± SD; ambient temperature, 34.7 ± 2.1 °C; relative humidity, 46 ± 3%; wet-bulb globe temperature, 28.0 ± 0.4 °C). Participants also completed four cognitive, power, agility, reaction time, and repeated sprint performance tests throughout each trial. Heart rate (HR) and rectal temperature (Trec) were measured continuously. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed to assess differences between physiological and performance variables. Alpha was set at ≤0.05, a priori. Data are reported as mean difference ± standard error (MD ± SE). RESULTS HR was significantly lower in euhydrated trials compared to hypohydrated trials, irrespective of dousing (8 ± 2 bpm; p = 0.001). Dousing did not significantly impact HR (p = 0.455) and there was no interaction between hydration and dousing (p = 0.893). Trec was significantly lower in euhydrated trials compared to hypohydrated trials (0.39 ± 0.05 °C, p < 0.001), with no effect from dousing alone (p = 0.113) or the interaction of hydration and dousing (p = 0.848). Dousing resulted in improved sprint performance (11 ± 3 belt rotations, p = 0.007), while hydration status did not (p = 0.235). CONCLUSIONS Athletes should aim to maintain euhydration during exercise in the heat for improved physiological function and cooling with ice-water dousing elicits additional performance benefits.","Benjamin, Courteney L; Sekiguchi, Yasuki; Morrissey, Margaret C; Butler, Cody R; Filep, Erica M; Stearns, Rebecca L; Casa, Douglas J",Journal of science and medicine in sport,45,31

Therefore we felt it essential to determine whether exercise training might injure a systemic right ventricle which is loaded with every heartbeat. Previous studies have shown that short term exercise training is feasible in TGA patients, but its effect on ventricular function is unclear. We demonstrate that systemic right ventricular function is preserved (and may be improved) in TGA patients with exercise training programmes that are typical of recreational and sports participation, with no evidence of injury on biomarker assessment. Stroke volume reserve during exercise correlates with exercise training response in our TGA patients, identifying this as a marker of a systemic right ventricle (SRV) that may most tolerate (and possibly even be improved by) exercise training. ABSTRACT We aimed to assess the haemodynamic effects of exercise training in transposition of the great arteries (TGA) patients with systemic right ventricles (SRVs). TGA patients have limited exercise tolerance and early mortality due to systemic (right) ventricular failure. Whether exercise training enhances or injures the SRV is unclear. Fourteen asymptomatic patients (34 ± 10 years) with TGA and SRV were enrolled in a 12 week exercise training programme (moderate and high-intensity workouts). Controls were matched on age, gender, BMI and physical activity. Exercise testing pre- and post- training included: (a) submaximal and peak; (b) prolonged (60 min) submaximal endurance and (c) high-intensity intervals. Oxygen uptake (V̇O2; Douglas bag technique), cardiac output (Q̇c, foreign-gas rebreathing), ventricular function (echocardiography and cardiac MRI) and serum biomarkers were assessed. TGA patients had lower peak V̇O2, Q̇c, and stroke volume (SV), a blunted Q̇c/V̇O2 slope, and diminished SV response to exercise (SV increase from rest: TGA = 15.2%, controls = 68.9%, P < 0.001) compared with controls. After training, TGA patients increased peak V̇O2 by 6 ± 8.5%, similar to controls (interaction P = 0.24). The magnitude of SV reserve on initial testing correlated with Q̇c training response (r = 0.58, P = 0.047), though overall, no change in peak Q̇c was observed. High-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) and N-terminal prohormone of brain naturetic peptide (NT pro-BNP) were low and did not change with acute exercise or after training. Our data show that TGA patients with SRVs in this study safely participated in exercise training and improved peak V̇O2. Neither prolonged submaximal exercise, nor high-intensity intervals, nor short-term exercise training seem to injure the systemic right ventricle.","Shafer, K M; Janssen, L; Carrick-Ranson, G; Rahmani, S; Palmer, D; Fujimoto, N; Livingston, S; Matulevicius, S A; Forbess, L W; Brickner, B; Levine, B D",The Journal of physiology,45,1

Recently, ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs), made from ferroelectric hafnium oxide (HfO2), have demonstrated promising SHG capabilities due to their unique symmetric transfer curves. In this letter, we illustrate how this symmetry is highly sensitive to material properties by varying the thickness of the ferroelectric layer and the doping of the silicon substrate. We show that the SHG conversion gain and the spectral purity are greatly increased (up to 96%) by precisely tuning the ferroelectric polarization reversal and the quantum tunneling currents. Based on this, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the generation of the difference and of the sum of two input frequencies (frequency mixing) with a single FeFET, which we attribute to the inherently strong quadratic component of the symmetric transfer characteristics. Due to the reversible and continuous ferroelectric switching in HfO2, our approach allows for an electrical control of the energy distribution of spectral components, thus opening up new and very promising paths for frequency manipulations with simple ferroelectric devices.","Mulaosmanovic, Halid; Dünkel, Stefan; Trentzsch, Martin; Beyer, Sven; Breyer, Evelyn T; Mikolajick, Thomas; Slesazeck, Stefan",ACS applied materials & interfaces,45,1

Precise control of primordial follicle activation (PFA) is essential for reproduction, but how this is achieved is unclear. Here, we show that canonical wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT) signaling is pivotal for pre-granulosa cell (pre-GC) activation during PFA. We identified several WNT ligands expressed in pre-GCs that act in an autocrine manner. Inhibition of WNT secretion from pre-GCs/GCs by conditional knockout (cKO) of the wntless (Wls) gene led to female infertility. In Wls cKO mice, GC layer thickness was greatly reduced in growing follicles, which resulted in impaired oocyte growth with both an abnormal, sustained nuclear localization of forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) and reduced phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6). Constitutive stabilization of β-catenin (CTNNB1) in pre-GCs/GCs induced morphological changes of pre-GCs from a squamous into a cuboidal form, though it did not influence oocyte activation. Our results reveal that canonical WNT signaling plays a permissive role in the transition of pre-GCs to GCs, which is an essential step to support oocyte growth.","Habara, Okiko; Logan, Catriona Y; Kanai-Azuma, Masami; Nusse, Roeland; Takase, Hinako M",Development,45,26

This supralinear synaptic integration is subject to modulation by inhibition. However, the specific rules by which different subtypes of interneurons affect the modulation have remained largely elusive. To examine how inhibition influences active synaptic integration, we optogenetically manipulated the activity of two subtypes of interneurons: dendrite-targeting somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons and perisomatic-targeting parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons. In acute slices of mouse primary visual cortex, electrical stimulation evoked nonlinear synaptic integration that depended on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Optogenetic activation of SST interneurons in conjunction with electrical stimulation resulted in predominantly divisive inhibitory gain control, reducing the magnitude of the supralinear response without affecting its threshold. PV interneuron activation, on the other hand, had a minimal effect on the supralinear response. Taken together, these results delineate the roles for SST and PV neurons in active synaptic integration. Differential effects of inhibition by SST and PV interneurons likely increase the computational capacity of the pyramidal neurons in modulating the nonlinear integration of synaptic output.Significance StatementThe principal function of neurons is to integrate a barrage of synaptic inputs and convert them into spike output. Such integration of inputs in the sensory neocortex ensures the transformation of environmental stimuli into a meaningful perception of the outside world. Synaptic integration in neuronal dendrites is shaped by passive electrical properties, active voltage-gated mechanisms, and inhibition from interneurons. Our results show that two genetically distinct subtypes of interneurons exert different types of inhibitory influence on active dendritic integration. Subtype-specific inhibitory influences provide a modulatory repertoire for the single cell computations that occur during synaptic integration.","Dorsett, Christopher; Philpot, Benjamin D; Smith, Spencer LaVere; Smith, Ikuko T",eNeuro,45,8

OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine and evaluate the trajectory of surgical wound pain from day 1 to day 14 after posterior spinal fusion (PSF) surgery in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Information regarding how the postoperative pain improves with time offers invaluable information not only to the patients and parents but also to assist the clinician in managing postoperative pain. METHODS AIS patients who were planned for elective PSF surgery from September 2015 to December 2015 were prospectively recruited into this study. All patients underwent a similar pain management regimen with patient-controlled anesthesia (PCA) morphine, acetaminophen, celecoxib, and oxycodone hydrochloride. RESULTS A total of 40 patients (36 F:4 M) were recruited. The visual analogue score (VAS) pain score was highest at 12 hours postoperation (6.0 ± 2.3). It reduced to 3.9 ± 2.2 (day 4), 1.9 ± 1.6 (day 7), and 0.7 ± 1.1 (day 14). The total PCA usage in all patients was 12.4 ± 9.9 mg (first 12 hours), 7.1 ± 8.0 mg (12 to 24 hours), 5.6 ± 6.9 (24-36 hours), and 2.1 ± 6.1 mg (36-48 hours). The celecoxib capsules usage was reducing from 215.0 ± 152.8 mg at 24 hours to 55.0 ± 90.4 mg on day 14. The acetaminophen usage was reducing from 2275 ± 1198 mg at 24 hours to 150 ± 483 mg at day 14. Oxycodone hydrochloride capsules consumption rose to the peak of 1.4 ± 2.8 mg on day 4 before gradually reducing to none by day 13. CONCLUSION With an adequate postoperation pain regimen, significant pain should subside to a tolerable level by postoperative day 4 and negligible by postoperative day 7.

METHODS A retrospective study of 28 patients with DAVFs who presented with intracranial hemorrhage to 2 separate institutions was performed. The information reviewed included clinical presentation, location and size of hemorrhage, angiographic features, treatment, and clinical and radiologically documented outcomes. Clinical and radiological follow-up were available in 27 of 28 patients (mean follow-up 17 months). RESULTS The vast majority of patients were male (86%), and the most common presenting symptom was sudden-onset headache. All DAVFs had cortical venous drainage, and about one-third were associated with a venous varix. The most common location was tentorial (75%). Treatment ranged from endovascular (71%), surgical (43%), Gamma Knife surgery (4%), or a combination of modalities. The majority of fistulas (75%) were completely obliterated, and most patients experienced excellent clinical outcome (71%, modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or 1). There were no complications in this series. CONCLUSIONS Case series, including the current one, suggest that the vast majority of patients who present with intracranial hemorrhage from a DAVF are male. The most common location for DAVFs presenting with hemorrhage is tentorial. Excellent outcomes are achieved with individualized treatment, which includes various therapeutic strategies alone or in combination. Despite the hemorrhagic presentation, almost two-thirds of patients experience a full recovery with no or minimal residual symptoms.","Daniels, David J; Vellimana, Ananth K; Zipfel, Gregory J; Lanzino, Giuseppe",Neurosurgical focus,45,33

Although Billroth II (BII) reconstruction is simpler and faster than Billroth I or Roux-en-Y (RY) reconstruction in patients undergoing totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG), BII reconstruction is associated with several complications, including more severe bile reflux. BII Braun anastomosis may be a better alternative to RY reconstruction. Methods. This retrospective study included 56 consecutive patients who underwent TLDG for gastric cancer, followed by BII Braun or RY reconstruction, between January 2013 and December 2015. Surgical outcomes, including length of operation, quantity of blood lost, and postoperative complications, were compared in the two groups. Results. Clinicopathological characteristics did not differ between the BII Braun and RY groups. Mean length of operation was significantly longer in the RY than the BII Braun group (157.3 min versus 134.6 min, p < 0.010), but length of hospital stay, blood loss, and complication rate did not differ between the two groups. Ileus occurred in three patients (10.0%) in the RY group. Endoscopic findings 6 months after surgery showed bile reflux in seven (28%) patients in the BII Braun group and five (17.2%) in the RY group (p = 0.343), but no significant differences in rate of gastric residue or degree of gastritis in the remnant stomach in the two groups. Conclusions. B-II Braun anastomosis is a good alternative to RY reconstruction, reducing length of operation and ileus after TLDG.","Cui, Long-Hai; Son, Sang-Yong; Shin, Ho-Jung; Byun, Cheulsu; Hur, Hoon; Han, Sang-Uk; Cho, Yong Kwan",Gastroenterology research and practice,45,1

METHODS Using a prospectively collected cohort of AIS patients, we performed univariate and multivariate (displayed as adjusted Odds Ratios, OR and 95% confidence intervals, 95% CI) analyses regarding the severity of AIS in patients with preceding DOAC (N = 210) versus VKA (N = 173) therapy. Additionally, we provide a sensitivity analysis considering only patients with warranted therapeutic anticoagulation activity. FINDINGS In a comprehensive stroke center population, the frequency of AIS under DOAC was multiple times higher than previously reported at around 6% of all AIS and steadily increasing. National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) in VKA patients (median 7, IQR 2-14) was equal to DOAC (median 5, IQR 2-16) on univariate analysis (P = 0.229). According to the multivariable linear logistic regression analysis adjusting for confounders of severe stroke, VKA was not significantly associated with higher NIHSS scores (β - 0.165, 95% CI - 1.874 to 1.545, P = 0.850) as compared to DOAC. Also in the sensitivity analysis considering only patients with warranted therapeutic OAC therapy, VKA was not significantly associated with higher NIHSS scores (β - 1.392, 95% CI - 3.506 to 0.721, P = 0.195) as compared to DOAC. However, VKA as compared to DOAC was significantly associated with lower rates of good functional outcome at three months (0.527, 95% CI 0.300-0.928), but not with increased mortality (aOR 1.825, 95% CI 0.780-4.273). INTERPRETATION Ischemic stroke in patients taking DOAC is an important and frequent scenario. Stroke severity in our real world population dataset is equal in patients taking VKA and DOAC, also in the case of warranted anticoagulation therapy. Preceding VKA as compared to DOAC was associated with lower rates of good functional outcome without excess mortality, but a causal relationship cannot be proven by our study design.","Auer, Elias; Frey, Sebastién; Kaesmacher, Johannes; Hakim, Arsany; Seiffge, David J; Goeldlin, Martina; Arnold, Marcel; Fischer, Urs; Jung, Simon; Meinel, Thomas Raphael",Journal of neurology,45,9

We conducted a multicenter one arm proof of concept interventional study. Patients with Covid-19 disease with moderate-to-severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, elevated C-reactive Protein and need for mechanical ventilation and/or CPAP were enrolled. One to three 250-300 ml unit of hyperimmune plasma (neutralizing antibodies titer ≥1:160) were administered. Primary outcome was 7-days hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were PaO2/FiO2, laboratory and radiologic changes, as well as weaning from mechanical ventilation and safety. The study observed 46 patients from March, 25 to April, 21 2020. Patients were aged 63, 61% male, of them, 30 were on CPAP and 7 intubated. PaO2/FiO2 was 128 (SD 47). Bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray was present in 36 patients (84%). Symptoms and ARDS duration were 14 (SD 7) and 6 days (SD 3). Three patients (6.5%) died within 7 days as compared to an expected 15% from the National Statistics and 30% from a small concurrent cohort of 23 patients. The upper one-sided 90%CI was 13.9%, allowing to reject the null hypothesis of a 15% mortality. PaO2/FiO2 increased by 112 units (95%CI 82 to142) in survivors, the chest radiogram severity decreased in 23% (95%CI 5% to 42%); CRP, Ferritin and LDH decreased by 60, 36 and 20% respectively. Weaning from CPAP was obtained in 26/30 patients and 3/7 were extubated. Five serious adverse events occurred in 4 patients (2 likely, 2 possible treatment related).

A subset of the irradiated animals was treated with AEOL 10150, a potent catalytic scavenger of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Lung tissues were collected at necropsy for molecular and immunohistochemical (IHC) studies. Microarray expression profiling in the irradiated lung tissues identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathways important in innate immunity. The elevated expression of cytokines (CCL2, CCL11, IL-8), complement factors (CFB, C3), apoptosis-related molecules (p53, PTEN, Bax, p21, MDM2, c-Caspase 3), and adhesion molecules (fibronectin, integrin β6, ICAM-1) were further studied using real-time PCR, Western blot, or IHC. Oxidative stress and pulmonary inflammatory cell infiltration were increased in the irradiated lungs. Treatment with AEOL 10150 significantly decreased oxidative stress and monocyte/macrophage infiltration. Cytokine/chemokine-induced excessive innate immune response after thoracic irradiation plays an important role in RILI. To our knowledge, this is the first study to highlight the role of cytokine/chemokine-induced innate immune responses in radiation-induced pulmonary toxicity in a NHP model.","Cui, Wanchang; Zhang, Pei; Hankey, Kim G; Xiao, Mang; Farese, Ann M; MacVittie, Thomas J",Health physics,45,17

There are a number of different approaches to achieve this. In this study we have collated current national and international guidelines to produce a synopsis to support this changing practice. METHODS The databases PubMed, Embase, Trip database, national guideline clearinghouse, BMJ Best practice were interrogated. Guidelines published before 2010 were excluded. The AGREE-II tool was used for quality assessment. RESULTS 24 guidelines were drawn from 2278 potential publications. A consensus exists for local excision for ""low risk"" T1 rectal cancer but there is no agreement how to stratify the risk of treatment failure. There is a low level of agreement for rectal preservation for more advanced disease but when mentioned is recommended for unfit patients or in th context of a clinical trial. Guidelines are inconsistent with respect to surveillance in node negative disease and after, complete response to chemoradiotherapy CONCLUSION: According to current guidelines and consensus statements organ preservation for rectal cancer beyond low risk T1, is still considered experimental and only indicated in patients unsuitable for radical surgery..

However, patients with cancer treated with these drugs might experience severe, life-threatening toxicity because of germline genetic variation in the DPYD gene. This is a genetic predisposition with an established mechanistic basis that links genetic variation in the DPYD gene to an increase in systemic drug exposure, resulting in an increased risk of toxicity. Pharmacology guidelines provide recommendations on avoiding treatment with fluoropyrimidines or reducing their dose in patients carrying DPYD genetic variants conferring an increased risk of toxicity. However, oncology societies in the United States do not recommend systematic testing. Instead, on April 30, 2020, the European Society for Medical Oncology issued a document recommending genetic testing. In this scenario of contradicting information, practicing oncologists struggle with reaching an informed decision on whether genetic testing should be applied before treatment. This is mostly due to uncertainty about the clinical relevance of genetic testing from the perspective of a practicing oncologist. To reach an informed decision, practicing oncologists need access to concise information on the genetic variants to be tested and a practitioner-friendly interpretation of the test results. We believe this information is currently lacking. To our knowledge, for the first time, we provide a single guide for health care professionals to make an evidence-based decision about DPYD testing for patients with cancer. This article provides the essential knowledge base for oncologists to have an informed discussion with their patients about the genetic testing for DPYD. This document assists practitioners in quickly evaluating whether, when, where, and how to order a DPYD genetic test.","Innocenti, Federico; Mills, Sarah C; Sanoff, Hanna; Ciccolini, Joseph; Lenz, Heinz-Josef; Milano, Gerard",JCO oncology practice,45,7

Electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) are widely used clinical diagnostic tools to monitor for abnormal brain and cardiac rhythms in patients. Here, a technique to simultaneously record video, EEG, and ECG in mice to measure behavior, brain, and cardiac activities, respectively, is described. The technique described herein utilizes a tethered (i.e., wired) recording configuration in which the implanted electrode on the head of the mouse is hard-wired to the recording equipment. Compared to wireless telemetry recording systems, the tethered arrangement possesses several technical advantages such as a greater possible number of channels for recording EEG or other biopotentials; lower electrode costs; and greater frequency bandwidth (i.e., sampling rate) of recordings. The basics of this technique can also be easily modified to accommodate recording other biosignals, such as electromyography (EMG) or plethysmography for assessment of muscle and respiratory activity, respectively. In addition to describing how to perform the EEG-ECG recordings, we also detail methods to quantify the resulting data for seizures, EEG spectral power, cardiac function, and heart rate variability, which we demonstrate in an example experiment using a mouse with epilepsy due to Kcna1 gene deletion. Video-EEG-ECG monitoring in mouse models of epilepsy or other neurological disease provides a powerful tool to identify dysfunction at the level of the brain, heart, or brain-heart interactions.","Mishra, Vikas; Gautier, Nicole M; Glasscock, Edward",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,45,31

Cholecystectomy has been proposed as a strategy to prevent recurrent IAP. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the efficacy of cholecystectomy in reducing the risk of recurrent IAP. METHODS PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases were searched systematically for studies including patients with IAP treated by cholecystectomy, with data on recurrence of pancreatitis. Studies published before 1980 or including chronic pancreatitis and case reports were excluded. The primary outcome was recurrence rate. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analyses were undertaken to calculate risk ratios using a random-effects model with the inverse-variance method. RESULTS Overall, ten studies were included, of which nine were used in pooled analyses. The study population consisted of 524 patients with 126 cholecystectomies. Of these 524 patients, 154 (29·4 (95 per cent c.i. 25·5 to 33·3) per cent) had recurrent disease. The recurrence rate was significantly lower after cholecystectomy than after conservative management (14 of 126 (11·1 per cent) versus 140 of 398 (35·2 per cent); risk ratio 0·44, 95 per cent c.i. 0·27 to 0·71). Even in patients in whom IAP was diagnosed after more extensive diagnostic testing, including endoscopic ultrasonography or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, the recurrence rate appeared to be lower after cholecystectomy (4 of 36 (11 per cent) versus 42 of 108 (38·9 per cent); risk ratio 0·41, 0·16 to 1·07). CONCLUSION Cholecystectomy after an episode of IAP reduces the risk of recurrent pancreatitis. This implies that current diagnostics are insufficient to exclude a biliary cause.","Umans, D S; Hallensleben, N D; Verdonk, R C; Bouwense, S A W; Fockens, P; van Santvoort, H C; Voermans, R P; Besselink, M G; Bruno, M J; van Hooft, J E",The British journal of surgery,45,29

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 30 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into Control group and Model group. The rat model of RA was induced by using type II collagen in Model group. The primary synovial cells were isolated from the synovial tissues of the rats and were assigned into Control group, Model group, and lncRNA H19 inhibitor intervention group. 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining was applied to detect cell proliferation in each group. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was employed to determine the cell apoptosis in each group. Western blotting assay was adopted to measure the expression levels of Notch1 and hairy/enhancer of split-1 (Hes1) in each group of cells. RESULTS The RA score of the Model group was higher than that of the Control group. Compared to the Control group, the expression of lncRNA H19, Notch, and Hes1 of the synovial cells in the Model group were significantly elevated. Besides, the cell proliferation rate of the Model was also increased, while the cell apoptosis rate was decreased compared with those in the Control group. Moreover, in comparison with Model group, lncRNA H19 inhibitor intervention group exhibited a lowered lncRNA H19 level, remarkably reduced cell proliferation rate and protein levels of Notch1 and Hes1, as well as notably raised cell apoptosis rate. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicated that lncRNA H19 inhibitor could repress the proliferation and promote the apoptosis of synovial cells in RA rats, which might be attributed to the inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway.","Zhi, L-Q; Zhong, Q; Ma, J-B; Xiao, L; Yao, S-X; Wang, X",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,45,1

We undertook a scoping review to identify and characterise the existing training programmes and curricula for GPOs globally. Design We searched three major electronic databases: EMBASE, Medline/PubMed and Education Source for articles that described a medical oncology training programme for GPs. All study types were eligible in this review. We followed a two-stage standardised screening process using two independent reviewers to evaluate the eligibility of the articles. Results Five peer-reviewed articles were included in our review and grey literature scans identified an additional seven GPO training programmes for a total of 12 programmes and their curricula. All of the included studies were from high-income countries. The duration of programmes varied from comprehensive programmes structured over 2 years (n = 2) to shorter duration medical oncology training activities (n = 2), a short, 1.5-day workshop and a 10-hour course. In the grey literature, GPO training programme durations ranged from 2 weeks to 13 months. A mixture of delivery methods was employed including didactic lectures and clinical rotations. Conclusion This scoping review identified a small number of heterogeneous studies and grey literature sources that described and/or evaluated medical oncology training programmes for GPs. The information synthesised here can be used to foster the collaboration needed for the continued development of GPO programmes that could help address the problem of lack of workforce to meet the rising burden of cancer, especially in LMICs.","Gyawali, Bishal; Jalink, Matthew; Effing, Sophie Marie Anne; Dalgarno, Nancy; Kolomitro, Klodiana; Thapa, Niresh; Poudyal, Bishesh Sharma; Berry, Scott",Ecancermedicalscience,45,5

This study used Generalizability Theory to test the dependability of psychotherapy competence assessments based on video observation of trainees. A 10-item rating form was developed from a collection of forms used by graduate programs (n = 102) in counseling and clinical psychology, and a review of the common factors research literature. This form was then used by 11 licensed psychologists to rate eight graduate trainees while viewing 129, approximately 5-min video clips from their psychotherapy sessions with clients (n = 22) at a graduate program's training clinic. Generalizability analyses were used to forecast how the number of raters and clients, and length of observation time impact the dependability of ratings in various rating designs. Raters were the primary source of error variance in ratings, with rater main effects (leniency bias) and dyadic effects (rater-target interactions) contributing 24% and 7% of variance, respectively. Variance due to segments (video clips) was also substantial, suggesting that therapist performance varies within the same counseling session. Generalizability coefficients (G) were highest for crossed rating designs and reached maximum levels (G > .50) after four raters watched each therapist working with three clients and observed 15 min per dyad. These findings suggest that expert raters show consensus in ratings even without rater training and only limited direct observation. Future research should investigate the validity of competence ratings as predictors of outcome.

Among 176 pediatric HSCT recipients, 84 with respiratory symptoms within one yr after HSCT were tested by viral culture or multiplex PCR. Within 28 d after HSCT, nine patients were infected with RVs; the incidence of a first episode of RV infection within 28 d after HSCT was 5.1%. Eight patients recovered without complications.

The viruses present in the biosphere are the top predators in the life chain, virtually without enemies, except perhaps the immune system, and harsh environmental physicochemical conditions restricting their dissemination. We know a lot about viruses, but do we know enough? This series of reviews is dedicated to adenoviruses (AdVs), a family of nonenveloped DNA viruses occurring in vertebrates, including humans. AdVs have been the focus of intense research for more than 67 years. Besides causing disease, they have immensely contributed to the advance of life sciences and medicine over the past decades. Recently, AdVs have been widely used as vehicles in gene therapy and vaccination. They continue to provide fundamental insights into virus-host interactions in cells, tissues and organisms, as well as systems and metabolic networks. This special issue of FEBS Letters presents a unique collection of 23 state-of-the-art review articles by leading adenovirologists. In this prelude, I present the chapters, which provide a solid basis for further exploring the rich heritage in adenovirus molecular cell biology, structural biology, genetics, immunology, gene therapy and epidemiology. I conclude with an essential discussion of six blind spots in adenovirology.","Greber, Urs F",FEBS letters,45,17

The objective of the present study was to determine whether patients with an active cannabis use disorder have an elevated risk of postoperative complications. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study of patients undergoing elective surgery in the United States using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2006 to 2015. A sample of 4,186,622 inpatients 18 to 65 yr of age presenting for 1 of 11 elective surgeries including total knee replacement, total hip replacement, coronary artery bypass graft, caesarian section, cholecystectomy, colectomy, hysterectomy, breast surgery, hernia repair, laminectomy, and other spine surgeries was selected. The principal exposure was an active cannabis use disorder, as defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic codes for cannabis dependence and cannabis abuse. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of in-hospital postoperative myocardial infarction, stroke, sepsis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, respiratory failure, and in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, total hospital costs, and the individual components of the composite endpoint. RESULTS The propensity-score matched-pairs cohort consisted of 27,206 patients. There was no statistically significant difference between patients with (400 of 13,603; 2.9%) and without (415 of 13,603; 3.1%) a reported active cannabis use disorder with regard to the composite perioperative outcome (unadjusted odds ratio = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.42; P < 0.001; Adjusted odds ratio = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.11; P = 0.63). However, the adjusted odds of postoperative myocardial infarction was 1.88 (95% CI, 1.31 to 2.69; P < 0.001) times higher for patients with a reported active cannabis use disorder (89 of 13,603; 0.7%) compared with those without (46 of 13,603; 0.3%) an active cannabis use disorder (unadjusted odds ratio = 2.88; 95% CI, 2.34 to 3.55; P < 0.001).

METHODS All clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with VATS or open lobectomy were retrospectively evaluated. Total nodes, N2 nodes, and nodes at each station were evaluated for associations with surgery type and location of involved lobe. RESULTS There were 79 VATS and 464 open lobectomy or segmental resections for stage I tumors. Overall, fewer lymph nodes were sampled with VATS compared with thoracotomy (7.4 +/- 0.6 vs 8.9 +/- 0.2, respectively; p = 0.029), and fewer N2 nodes were sampled with VATS versus thoracotomy as well (2.5 +/- 3.0 vs 3.7 +/- 3.3, p = 0.004). There were no differences in N1 node sampling between the two groups (5.2 +/- 3.6 vs 4.9 +/- 4.2, p = 0.592). Furthermore, there were more station 7 nodes with thoracotomy versus VATS (1.2 +/- 0.1 vs 0.6 +/- 0.1, p = 0.002). Among right-sided lesions, there was no difference in 4R nodes between groups (1.4 +/- 0.4 vs 1.6 +/- 0.2, p = 0.7) although there was a trend toward more level 7 nodes with thoracotomy (1.0 +/- 0.2 vs 1.4 +/- 0.2, p < 0.08). Among left-sided resections there were more station 7 nodes with thoracotomy versus VATS (1.0 +/- 0.1 vs 0.4 +/- 0.1, p < 0.001) and more station 5/6 nodes (1.1 +/- 0.1 vs 0.5 +/- 0.1, p < 0.04). For upper lobe resections, the total nodes (8.9 +/- 0.3 vs 7.4 +/- 0.7, p = 0.05) and station 7 nodes (1.0 +/- 0.1 vs 0.6 +/- 0.1, p < 0.01) were higher with thoracotomy than VATS. There was no difference in 2-year survival between groups (81% vs 83%, p = 0.4). CONCLUSIONS Our early experience with VATS has been associated with fewer lymph nodes sampled compared with open lobectomy although there was no survival difference. Analysis of these differences has directed us toward a more focused lymph node sampling with VATS lobectomy.","Denlinger, Chadrick E; Fernandez, Felix; Meyers, Bryan F; Pratt, Wande; Zoole, Jennifer Bell; Patterson, G Alexander; Krupnick, A Sasha; Kreisel, Daniel; Crabtree, Traves",The Annals of thoracic surgery,45,1

Here, we elucidate a transcription-independent mechanism for the neuropoietic activities of IL-6 related to axon development, regeneration, and repair. We examined the outcome of IL-6 deficiency on structure and function of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons, which form the optic projection. We found that IL-6 deficiency substantially delays anterograde axon transport in vivo. The reduced rate of axon transport is accompanied by changes in morphology, structure, and post-translational modification of microtubules. In vivo and in vitro studies in mice and swine revealed that IL-6-dependent microtubule phenotypes arise from protein-protein interactions between STAT3 and stathmin. As in tumor cells and T cells, this STAT3-stathmin interaction stabilizes microtubules in RGCs. Thus, this IL-6-STAT3-dependent mechanism for axon architecture is likely a fundamental mechanism for microtubule stability systemically.","Wareham, Lauren K; Echevarria, Franklin D; Sousa, Jennifer L; Konlian, Danielle O; Dallas, Gabrielle; Formichella, Cathryn R; Sankaran, Priya; Goralski, Peter J; Gustafson, Jenna R; Sappington, Rebecca M",iScience,45,33

METHODS This study included patients with coronavirus disease-2019 who were hospitalized between February 9, 2020, and March 30, 2020. Univariate Cox regression analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO) were used to select variables. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was applied to identify independent risk factors in coronavirus disease-2019. RESULTS 1135 patients were analysed during the study period. A total of 35 variables were considered to be risk factors after the univariate regression analysis of the clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters (p < 0.05), and LASSO regression analysis screened out seven risk factors for further study. The six independent risk factors revealed by multivariate Cox regression were myoglobin (HR 5.353, 95% CI 2.633-10.882; p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (HR 2.063, 95% CI 1.036-4.109; p = 0.039), neutrophil count (HR 2.015, 95% CI 1.154-3.518; p = 0.014), interleukin 6 (HR 9.753, 95% CI 2.952-32.218; p < 0.001), age (HR 2.016, 95% CI 1.077-3.773; p = 0.028), and international normalized ratio (HR 2.595, 95% CI 1.412-4.769; p = 0.002). CONCLUSION Our results suggested that inflammation-associated factors were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality in coronavirus disease-2019 patients. C-reactive protein, neutrophil count and interleukin 6 were independent factors for predicting in-hospital mortality and had a better independent predictive ability. We believe these findings may allow early identification of the patients at high risk for death, and can also assist better management of these patients. This article is protected by copyright.

The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the literature examining the chance of having a live born child after ART in women with chronic diseases, compared to other women receiving ART. We focused on some of the most prevalent chronic diseases in women during their reproductive years, ie ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus. Secondly, we studied the chance of successful implantation. The literature search was performed in the database Pubmed.gov. including all studies published before October 2020. Title and abstracts of 58 papers were reviewed, 37 papers were excluded and other 8 studies were excluded after full-text evaluation. Only 13 papers were eligible for review. Results indicate that women with ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hyperthyroidism, and diabetes mellitus type 2 might have problems with low implantation rate or early embryo development during ART. On the contrary, the few studies on women with hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus type 1, and epilepsy suggest an equivalent chance of a live birth compared to other women undergoing ART. A possible explanation behind these differences could reside in the disease-specific dysregulation of the innate or adaptive immune system. To our knowledge, this is the first review on ART in women with chronic diseases, and it has disclosed that the evidence in this area is indeed sparse. We encourage others to examine live birth after ART in women with chronic diseases.","Nørgård, Bente Mertz; Catalini, Laura; Jølving, Line Riis; Larsen, Michael Due; Friedman, Sonia; Fedder, Jens",Clinical epidemiology,45,1

For those familiar with conventional techniques, however, this type of operation demands a different type of eye/hand coordination and involves unfamiliar working instruments. Herein, the authors describe the learning curve and the clinical outcomes of single port laparoscopic cholecystectomy for 150 consecutive patients with benign gallbladder disease. METHOD All patients underwent single port laparoscopic cholecystectomy using a homemade glove port by one of five operators with different levels of experiences of laparoscopic surgery. The learning curve for each operator was fitted using the non-linear ordinary least squares method based on a non-linear regression model. RESULTS Mean operating time was 77.6 ± 28.5 min. Fourteen patients (6.0%) were converted to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Complications occurred in 15 patients (10.0%), as follows: bile duct injury (n = 2), surgical site infection (n = 8), seroma (n = 2), and wound pain (n = 3). One operator achieved a learning curve plateau at 61.4 min per procedure after 8.5 cases and his time improved by 95.3 min as compared with initial operation time. Younger surgeons showed significant decreases in mean operation time and achieved stable mean operation times. In particular, younger surgeons showed significant decreases in operation times after 20 cases. CONCLUSION Experienced laparoscopic surgeons can safely perform single port laparoscopic cholecystectomy using conventional or angled laparoscopic instruments. The present study shows that an operator can overcome the single port laparoscopic cholecystectomy learning curve in about eight cases.","Han, Hyung Joon; Choi, Sae Byeol; Park, Man Sik; Lee, Jin Suk; Kim, Wan Bae; Song, Tae Jin; Choi, Sang Yong",Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic sciences,45,19

While bat, camel, and human DPP4 support MERS-CoV infection, several DPP4 orthologs, including mouse, ferret, hamster, and guinea pig DPP4, do not. Previous work revealed that glycosylation of mouse DPP4 plays a role in blocking MERS-CoV infection. Here, we tested whether glycosylation also acts as a determinant of permissivity for ferret, hamster, and guinea pig DPP4. We found that, while glycosylation plays an important role in these orthologs, additional sequence and structural determinants impact their ability to act as functional receptors for MERS-CoV. These results provide insight into DPP4 species-specific differences impacting MERS-CoV host range and better inform our understanding of virus-receptor interactions associated with disease emergence and host susceptibility.IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV is a recently emerged zoonotic virus that is still circulating in the human population with an ∼35% mortality rate. With no available vaccines or therapeutics, the study of MERS-CoV pathogenesis is crucial for its control and prevention. However, in vivo studies are limited because MERS-CoV cannot infect wild-type mice due to incompatibilities between the virus spike and the mouse host cell receptor, mouse DPP4 (mDPP4). Specifically, mDPP4 has a nonconserved glycosylation site that acts as a barrier to MERS-CoV infection. Thus, one mouse model strategy has been to modify the mouse genome to remove this glycosylation site. Here, we investigated whether glycosylation acts as a barrier to infection for other nonpermissive small-animal species, namely, ferret, guinea pig, and hamster. Understanding the virus-receptor interactions for these DPP4 orthologs will help in the development of additional animal models while also revealing species-specific differences impacting MERS-CoV host range.","Peck, Kayla M; Scobey, Trevor; Swanstrom, Jesica; Jensen, Kara L; Burch, Christina L; Baric, Ralph S; Heise, Mark T",Journal of virology,45,23

The causative agent, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), replicates rapidly, efficiently disseminating within the infected host and being passed on to susceptible animals via direct contact or the aerosol route. To survive in the host, FMDV has evolved to block the host interferon (IFN) response. Previously, we and others demonstrated that the leader proteinase (L(pro)) of FMDV is an IFN antagonist. Here, we report that another FMDV-encoded proteinase, 3C(pro), also inhibits IFN-α/β response and the expression of IFN-stimulated genes. Acting in a proteasome- and caspase-independent manner, the 3C(pro) of FMDV proteolytically cleaved nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-κB) essential modulator (NEMO), a bridging adaptor protein essential for activating both NF-κB and interferon-regulatory factor signaling pathways. 3C(pro) specifically targeted NEMO at the Gln 383 residue, cleaving off the C-terminal zinc finger domain from the protein. This cleavage impaired the ability of NEMO to activate downstream IFN production and to act as a signaling adaptor of the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway. Mutations specifically disrupting the cysteine protease activity of 3C(pro) abrogated NEMO cleavage and the inhibition of IFN induction. Collectively, our data identify NEMO as a substrate for FMDV 3C(pro) and reveal a novel mechanism evolved by a picornavirus to counteract innate immune signaling.","Wang, Dang; Fang, Liurong; Li, Kui; Zhong, Huijuan; Fan, Jinxiu; Ouyang, Chao; Zhang, Huan; Duan, Erzhen; Luo, Rui; Zhang, Zhongming; Liu, Xiangtao; Chen, Huanchun; Xiao, Shaobo",Journal of virology,45,1

This scoping review analysed the existing, contemporary evidence regarding surgical positioning-related tissue damage risks, from both biomechanical and clinical perspectives, focusing on the challenges in preventing tissue damage in the constraining operating room environment, which does not allow repositioning and limits the use of dynamic or thick and soft support surfaces. Deep and multidisciplinary aetiological understanding is required for effective prevention of intraoperatively acquired tissue damage, primarily including pressure ulcers (injuries) and neural injuries. Lack of such understanding typically leads to misconceptions and increased risk to patients. This article therefore provides a comprehensive aetiological description concerning the types of potential tissue damage, vulnerable anatomical locations, the risk factors specific to the operative setting (eg, the effects of anaesthetics and instruments), the complex interactions between the tissue damage risk and the pathophysiology of the surgery itself (eg, the inflammatory response to the surgical incisions), risk assessments for surgical patients and their limitations, and available (including emerging) technologies for positioning. The present multidisciplinary and integrated approach, which holistically joins the bioengineering and clinical perspectives, is unique to this work and has not been taken before. Close collaboration between bioengineers and clinicians, such as demonstrated here, is required to revisit the design of operating tables, support surfaces for surgery, surgical instruments for patient stabilisation, and for surgical access. Each type of equipment and its combined use should be evaluated and improved where needed with regard to the two major threats to tissue health in the operative setting: pressure ulcers and neural damage.","Gefen, Amit; Creehan, Sue; Black, Joyce",International wound journal,45,9

Participants were enrolled from 18 countries in Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, Latin America, and North America. Subjects underwent anogenital examinations and sampling of the penis, scrotum, and perineal/perianal regions. RESULTS The incidence rate of any HPV DNA genotype 6, 11, 16, and/or 18 detection was 9.0 cases per 100 person-years. Rates of HPV DNA detection were highest in men from Africa. Median time to clearance of HPV genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18 DNA was 6.1, 6.1, 7.7, and 6.2 months, respectively. Median time to clearance of persistently detected HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 DNA was 6.7, 3.2, 9.2, and 4.7 months, respectively. CONCLUSION The study results suggest that the acquisition of HPV 6, 11, 16, and/or 18 in males is common and that many of these so-called infections are subsequently cleared, similar to findings for women. Nevertheless, given the high rate of HPV detection among young men, HPV vaccination of males may reduce infection in men and reduce the overall burden of HPV-associated disease in the community.","Moreira, Edson Duarte; Giuliano, Anna R; Palefsky, Joel; Flores, Carlos Aranda; Goldstone, Stephen; Ferris, Daron; Hillman, Richard J; Moi, Harald; Stoler, Mark H; Marshall, Brooke; Vuocolo, Scott; Guris, Dalya; Haupt, Richard M",The Journal of infectious diseases,45,12

Single anastomosis duodenal switch (LDS) combines a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) with a loop attachment of the duodenal stump. There are two major variables the sleeve, and the intestine that processes ingested food. A comparison of patients that had a VSG with those that have had a LDS approximates the contribution of each component. METHODS A retrospective matched cohort analysis of VSG and LDS patients was obtained by matching every LDS patient to a VSG patient of the same sex and BMI. Excess weight lost percentage (%EWL) and the total weight loss percentage (%TWL) was analyzed. The data was compared through descriptive statistics and non-linear regression analysis. RESULTS Over 18 months, patients who received the LDS lost more %TWL and %EWL and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Additionally, with time, the difference became more profound. Weight loss stabilized at approximately 9-12 months and 15 to 18 for VSG and LDS patients', respectively. At 6 months post op, there was approximately 13 % difference in weight loss. This increased to 29 % difference at 18 months. CONCLUSION LDS patients lose more weight than VSG. Preserving 3 m of intestinal length adds 30 % greater weight loss at 18 months. Early weight loss is similar between the two operations, while the intestinal component becomes more important with weight loss differentials increasing as time since surgery lengthens.","Cottam, Austin; Cottam, Daniel; Roslin, Mitchell; Cottam, Samuel; Medlin, Walter; Richards, Christina; Surve, Amit; Zaveri, Hinali",Obesity surgery,45,29

In this study, we aimed to investigate the possible association between serum levels of the inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP) and personality traits. METHODS In this study, serum levels of high-sensitivity CRP were determined by ELISA in a population of 270 42-year-old women recruited from the population registry who had been assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory. Self-reported previous or ongoing depression was also recorded. Unpaired two-tailed t-tests were used for comparison between two groups and correlations were evaluated by the calculation of Pearson's r-coefficient. RESULTS The temperament trait harm avoidance was positively (r = 0.227, p < 0.05) and the character trait self-directedness was negatively (r = -0.261, p < 0.01) associated with serum levels of CRP (p-values corrected for multiple comparisons). The correlations between the personality traits and CRP were observed also after exclusion of subjects reporting ongoing depression (n = 26). Whereas women reporting ongoing depression showed significantly increased levels of CRP as compared to non-depressed women (n = 155), women reporting a history of depression displayed no significant difference in CRP levels as compared to women that reported that they had never been depressed. CONCLUSION Serum levels of CRP in women was found to be associated with the personality traits harm avoidance and self-directedness. In addition, moderately elevated levels may be a state dependent marker of depression.","Henningsson, Susanne; Baghaei, Fariba; Rosmond, Roland; Holm, Göran; Landén, Mikael; Anckarsäter, Henrik; Ekman, Agneta",Behavioral and brain functions : BBF,45,1

As a critical epidemiological metric, the incubation period is of public health and clinical importance. While the incubation time of COVID-19 is generally similar to that of SARS and MERS, recent studies identifying factors that impact the incubation period of COVID-19, travel history, for example, only tell part of the story.

During surgery the correct setting of operative room (OR) is mandatory to reduce the risk of contamination. Personal protection equipment (PPE), specific devices, and planned OR setting are essential during surgery in pandemic COVID-19. Methods: Medline, PubMed, Scientific societies recommendations, and guidelines were consulted to identify articles reporting the setup of OR during pandemic COVID-19. Results: OR must have a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter with negative pressure and a high air exchange cycle rate. Every supply kit should be packed and placed in the OR before patient arrival. A detailed checklist of equipment and devices is necessary. Personal PPE at the highest level should be provided to every HCP (Association of the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation [AAMI]-Level-III surgical gowns; double latex-free gloves with Acceptable Quality Level <1.0; FFP3 or powered air-purifying respirator masks with face shield). Anesthesia should be performed with a rapid sequence intubation. During surgery energy devices should be settled to the lower level in combination with a smoke evacuation switch pen with disposable smoke evacuation HEPA filter to minimize surgical smoke spread. During laparoscopy low pneumoperitoneum pressures and aspiration systems must be provided. Conclusions: Emergency surgery during pandemic COVID-19 increases the risk for every HCP in the OR. A theoretical risk of transmission from the surgical field exists. It is mandatory the adoption of strong strategies to reduce the risk of contamination in the OR.","Perrone, Gennaro; Giuffrida, Mario; Bellini, Valentina; Lo Coco, Alessandro; Pattonieri, Vittoria; Bonati, Elena; Del Rio, Paolo; Bignami, Elena Giovanna; Catena, Fausto",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Three new antiviral drugs, exploiting this technology, have been approved by the FDA while others are in clinical studies as anticancer agents. AREAS COVERED The authors describe the origin and development of this technology and its incredible success in transforming the drug discovery of antiviral and anticancer nucleoside analogues. As evidence, discussion on the antiviral ProTides on the market, and those currently in clinical development is included. The authors focus on how the proven capacity of this technology to generate new drug candidates has stimulated its application to non-nucleoside-based molecules. EXPERT OPINION The ProTide approach has been extremely successful in delivering blockbuster antiviral medicines and it seems promising in oncology. Its application to non-nucleoside-based small molecules is recently emerging and proving effective in other therapeutic areas. However, investigations to explain the lack of activity of certain ProTide series and comprehensive structure activity relationship studies to identify the appropriate phosphoramidate motifs depending on the parent molecule are in our opinion mandatory for the future development of these compounds.","Serpi, Michaela; Pertusati, Fabrizio",Expert opinion on drug discovery,45,1

The model assumes that the images in the dataset are non-linear mappings of low-dimensional latent vectors. We use the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to represent the non-linear transformation. The parameters of the generator as well as the low-dimensional latent vectors are jointly estimated only from the undersampled measurements. This approach is different from traditional CNN approaches that require extensive fully sampled training data. We penalize the norm of the gradients of the non-linear mapping to constrain the manifold to be smooth, while temporal gradients of the latent vectors are penalized to obtain a smoothly varying time-series. The proposed scheme brings in the spatial regularization provided by the convolutional network. The main benefit of the proposed scheme is the improvement in image quality and the orders-of-magnitude reduction in memory demand compared to traditional manifold models. To minimize the computational complexity of the algorithm, we introduce an efficient progressive training-in-time approach and an approximate cost function. These approaches speed up the image reconstructions and offers better reconstruction performance.","Zou, Qing; Ahmed, Abdul Haseeb; Nagpal, Prashant; Kruger, Stanley; Jacob, Mathews",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,45,20

In addressing emergencies or special cases, each medical institution in a metropolitan area typically has a siloed process for capturing emergency patient records. These approaches vary in technical capabilities and may include use of an electronic medical record system (EMR) or a hybrid paper/EMR process. Given the projected volume of patients for the COVID-19 pandemic and the proposed multi-institutional team approach needed in case of significant provider illness, IEMS sought a simple, efficient, consolidated EMR solution to support planning for the potential capacity gap. IEMS approached Regenstrief Institute (RI), an established partner with experience in supporting OpenMRS, a global good EMR platform that had been deployed in multiple settings globally. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this project was to determine if OpenMRS, a global good, could be used to quickly stand up a system that would meet the needs for health emergency data collection and reporting. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION METHODS The team used an ""all hands on deck"" approach, bringing together technical and subject matter experts, and a human-centered and iterative process to ensure the system met the key needs of IEMS. The OpenMRS Reference Application was adapted to the specific need and deployed as Docker containers to servers within the Indiana Health Information Exchange. PROJECT OUTCOMES AND LESSONS LEARNED In less than two weeks, the Regenstrief team was able to install, configure and set up a working version of OpenMRS to support the desired electronic record requirements for the IEMS disaster field clinics. Using a human-centered approach, the RI team developed, tested, and released a user-friendly, installation-ready solution complete with an end user manual and a base support plan. IEMS and RI are sharing this approach to demonstrate how a global good can quickly generate a solution for COVID-19 and other disaster responses. CONCLUSIONS Open source global goods can rapidly be adapted to meet local needs in an emergency. OpenMRS can be adapted to meet the needs of basic emergency medical services registration, triage, and basic data collection.","Mamlin, Burke W; Shivers, Jennifer E; Glober, Nancy K; Dick, Jonathan J",International journal of medical informatics,45,14

RESULTS Patterns of diffusion restriction were variable in our population with only a minority (26%) of lesions showing a central pattern. Among other patterns, peripheral restriction was present in 42% of the cases. Central diffusion restriction was associated with smaller abscesses. Duration of symptoms was not associated with restriction pattern. Inter-reader agreement for pattern description was moderate (κ = 0.52). CONCLUSIONS Liver abscesses have a much more variable appearance than previously described, with both central and peripheral diffusion restriction patterns observed frequently.

Pregnant women have increased susceptibility and disease severity to viral infections like influenza and HRVs, as do asthmatics. Successful pregnancy requires immunological modulation to permit fetal tolerance. OBJECTIVES To determine whether pregnant women have reduced innate antiviral interferon (IFN) responses to HRV infection compared with non-pregnant women. METHODS An in vitro culture system was used, where peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood of 54 women, including 10 stable asthmatics who were pregnant and 10 who were not pregnant, 10 non-asthmatic women who were pregnant, 10 who were ≥6 months post partum and 10 who were not pregnant. Samples were also collected from four exacerbating pregnant asthmatics. PBMCs were cultured with HRV43 and HRV1B. The antiviral proteins IFNα and IFNλ were measured from culture supernatants by ELISA. RESULTS Compared with healthy non-pregnant women, pregnant women had significantly reduced innate IFN responses to HRV infection (p<0.02), persisting ≥6 months post partum (p≤0.02). Pregnant asthmatics had significantly reduced IFNλ responses compared with healthy non-pregnant women (p≤0.034), while during current asthma exacerbations a decrease in IFNα (p≤0.023) and IFNλ (p=0.007) was observed. Induction by a TLR7 agonist induced a similar pattern of decreased innate IFNs during pregnancy as observed when HRV was the inducing agent. CONCLUSIONS Reduced antiviral IFNs during pregnancy and asthma provide an important mechanism for increased susceptibility, morbidity and mortality in pregnant women with respiratory viral infection.","Forbes, Rebecca Louise; Gibson, Peter G; Murphy, Vanessa E; Wark, Peter A B",Thorax,45,1

In ATSD, the individual is both the causative actor and casualty. As a result, in ATSD, distinctive negative psychological sequelae are grafted onto the usual distressing symptoms of PTSD, differentiating them from both PTSD and complex-PTSD. Whether the actions were intentional or unintentional and regardless of complications by comorbid psychiatric disorders, individuals with ATSD additionally experience some or all of the following symptoms stemming from actions for which they were responsible, wholly or in part: severe and unrelenting reality-based guilt, shame, remorse, regret, bitterness, self-betrayal, inability to trust oneself, and moral injury. Empirical studies investigating trauma-associated guilt and moral injury provide evidence to support these formulations. Clinical vignettes illustrate a range of circumstances leading to ATSD, in each instance adding significantly to the individual's distress, impeding recovery, and often requiring specific psychotherapeutic attention over and above that required for PTSD or complex-PTSD. These psychotherapeutic strategies have included intense, prolonged, noninterruptive, open-minded listening; avoiding premature whitewashing of responsibility and guilt; facilitating grief over lost innocence; helping create personal narratives that permit self-acceptance despite permanently altered damaged self-image; and, for some individuals, guiding repentance and restorative actions. Systematic case series and additional studies are necessary to ascertain how intentionality, self-harm versus harming others, and various comorbidities shape ATSD presentations, and to better delineate effective treatment strategies.","Yager, Joel; Kay, Jerald",The Journal of nervous and mental disease,45,0

The development of monitoring approaches with high temporal and spatial resolution and actively involving citizens, is strategic in areas where relevant and also short-term emissive events frequently occur and the conventional approaches fail due to the high variability of fugitive emissions. Moreover, even if unpleasant odors are not necessarily direct triggers of health effects, they could be associated with the release of other harmful compounds. Monitoring approaches also involving citizens are thus strategic tools because odors annoyance perceived by population may be a potential health risk warning. Therefore, the developed sensing network was set up in Val d'Agri (Basilicata, Italy) where a petroleum pre-treatment plant (COVA) rises in a rural and inhabited area. The data collected during the monitoring campaign from the 16th February to the 30th July 2017, showed Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOCs) concentrations decreasing moving away from the plant and up to five times higher than levels registered in the closest municipality (Viggiano). Moreover, recurrent short-term critical events characterized by concentration values far above the average of the period and with maximum values ranging from 0.92 to 1.89 ppm, were registered in correspondence with high levels of benzene (up to 23.9 μg/m3) and anemometric conditions able to transport pollutants from COVA to each receptor site. The spatial and temporal distribution of TVOC concentrations proved to be affected by the distance from COVA, wind direction and industrial activities verified using video reportage and citizen claims. Therefore, the developed approach has proven to be a useful tool to credit people's perception of odors and also to quantify citizen exposure to VOCs during short-term events.","Di Gilio, Alessia; Palmisani, Jolanda; Petraccone, Stefania; de Gennaro, Gianluigi",The Science of the total environment,45,31

How the dual-reactive TCR recognizes these radically distinct p-MHC surfaces is revealed by our structural study, that the introduction of TCR T18A induces a molecular switch of the TL9 peptide in B4201 to approach its conformation in B8101. Most importantly, unique docking of CDR3β towards MHC but not peptide ligand strengthens the peptide tolerance of T18A, extends the ability of TCR to adapt mutations.

In this Letter, we experimentally investigate the generation of drops of a viscoelastic suspension, made of non-Brownian spherical particles dispersed in a dilute polymer solution. Using high-speed imaging, we characterize the different stages of the detachment. Our experiments show that the particles primarily affect the initial Newtonian necking by increasing the fluid viscosity. In the viscoelastic regime, particles do not affect the thinning until the onset of the blistering instability, which they accelerate. We find that the transition from one regime to another, which corresponds to the coil-stretch transition of the polymer chains, strongly depends on the particle content. Considering that the presence of rigid particles increase the deformation of the liquid phase, we propose an expression for the local strain rate in the suspension, which rationalizes our experimental results.

The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is considered the gold standard for measuring serum neutralizing antibodies but requires high level biosafety, live viral cultures and days to complete. We hypothesized that competitive enzyme linked immunoassays (ELISAs) based on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) attachment to its host receptor, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2r), would correlate with PRNT, given the central role of RBD-ACE2r interactions in infection and published studies to date, and enable evaluation of vaccine responses. Methods and Findings: Configuration and development of a competitive ELISA with plate-bound RBD and soluble biotinylated ACE2r was accomplished using pairs of pre/post vaccine serum. When the competitive ELISA was used to evaluate N=32 samples from COVID-19 patients previously tested by PRNT, excellent correlation in IC50 results were observed (rs= .83, p < 0.0001). When the competitive ELISA was used to evaluate N=41 vaccinated individuals and an additional N=14 unvaccinated recovered COVID-19 patients, significant differences in RBD-ACE2r inhibitory activity were associated with prior history of COVID-19 and type of vaccine received. In longitudinal analyses pre and up to 200 days post vaccine, surrogate neutralizing activity increased markedly after primary and booster vaccine doses, but fell substantially, up to <12% maximal levels within 6 months. Conclusions: A competitive ELISA based on inhibition of RBD-ACE2r attachment correlates well with PRNT, quantifies significantly higher activity among vaccine recipients with prior COVID (vs. those without), and highlights marked declines in surrogate neutralizing activity over a 6 month period post vaccination. The findings raise concern about the duration of vaccine responses and potential need for booster shots.","Wisnewski, A. V.; Liu, J.; Lucas, C.

The goal, however, has been to describe these corpora themselves rather than to make inferences about underlying populations. This paper shows that a difference-in-differences method based on the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index can identify the bias in digital corpora that is introduced by non-local populations. These methods tell us where significant changes have taken place and whether this leads to increased or decreased diversity. This is an important step in aligning digital corpora like social media with the real-world populations that have produced them.","Dunn, Jonathan; Coupe, Tom; Adams, Benjamin",,45,1

METHODS Based on preliminary analysis of 39 different segments of the N protein, We choosed six purified N protein for further antigenicity characterization in this study, including that PN360 (1 -360aa), PN301 (1-301aa), PN199 (30-228aa), PN185 (30-214aa), PN155b (60-214aa), and PN125 (90-214aa). We developed Western-Bolt and ELISA to detect antibody reactivity between truncated N fragments with sera from SARS-CoV-negative normal adults or SARS-CoV patient convalescent sera. RESULTS Western-Bolt results show that all the six fragments have reacted with the SARS patient convalescent sera, but the PN360 and PN301 showed obvious cross-reaction with sera from SARS-CoV-negative normal adults; sensitivity analysis using an ELISA coating with PN199, PN185, PN155b, PN125 as antigen showed that the PN185 and PN155b are better than PN125.

These include the elderly, persons with cardiopulmonary diseases, and immunocompromised hosts. Epidemiological evidence indicates that the impact of RSV in older adults may be similar to that of nonpandemic influenza. In addition, RSV has been found to cause 2 to 5% of adult community-acquired pneumonias. Attack rates in nursing homes are approximately 5 to 10% per year, with significant rates of pneumonia (10 to 20%) and death (2 to 5%). Clinical features may be difficult to distinguish from those of influenza but include nasal congestion, cough, wheezing, and low-grade fever. Bone marrow transplant patients prior to marrow engraftment are at highest risk for pneumonia and death. Diagnosis of RSV infection in adults is difficult because viral culture and antigen detection are insensitive, presumably due to low viral titers in nasal secretions, but early bronchoscopy is valuable in immunosuppressed patients. Treatment of RSV in the elderly is largely supportive, whereas early therapy with ribavirin and intravenous gamma globulin is associated with improved survival in immunocompromised persons. An effective RSV vaccine has not yet been developed, and thus prevention of RSV infection is limited to standard infection control practices such as hand washing and the use of gowns and gloves.","Falsey, A R; Walsh, E E",Clinical microbiology reviews,45,11

With the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2, there are now seven human coronaviruses. Those that cause mild diseases are the 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1, and the pathogenic species are SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviruses (order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and subfamily Orthocoronavirinae) are spherical (125nm diameter), and enveloped with club-shaped spikes on the surface giving the appearance of a solar corona. Within the helically symmetrical nucleocapsid is the large positive sense, single stranded RNA. Of the four coronavirus genera (α,β,γ,δ), human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are classified under α-CoV (HCoV-229E and NL63) and β-CoV (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoVOC43 and HCoV-HKU1). SARS-CoV-2 is a β-CoV and shows fairly close relatedness with two bat-derived CoV-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Even so, its genome is similar to that of the typical CoVs. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats, and it appears to be so for SARS-CoV-2 as well. The possibility of an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans has already been shown with civet cats acting as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoVs, and dromedary camels for MERS-CoV. Human-to-human transmission is primarily achieved through close contact of respiratory droplets, direct contact with the infected individuals, or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. The coronaviral genome contains four major structural proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, all of which are encoded within the 3' end of the genome. The S protein mediates attachment of the virus to the host cell surface receptors resulting in fusion and subsequent viral entry. The M protein is the most abundant protein and defines the shape of the viral envelope. The E protein is the smallest of the major structural proteins and participates in viral assembly and budding. The N protein is the only one that binds to the RNA genome and is also involved in viral assembly and budding. Replication of coronaviruses begin with attachment and entry. Attachment of the virus to the host cell is initiated by interactions between the S protein and its specific receptor. Following receptor binding, the virus enters host cell cytosol via cleavage of S protein by a protease enzyme, followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The next step is the translation of the replicase gene from the virion genomic RNA and then translation and assembly of the viral replicase complexes. Following replication and subgenomic RNA synthesis, encapsidation occurs resulting in the formation of the mature virus. Following assembly, virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and released by exocytosis.","Malik, Y A",The Malaysian journal of pathology,45,9

Of the many functions of the body affected by the complex process of ageing, the immune system in particular undergoes various changes, collectively termed immunosenescence. As a result, elderly people are more susceptible to infections and are frequently less protected by vaccines. This review summarises the effect of ageing on immunity, emphasising the age-associated changes within T and B cells at a molecular and cellular level. Furthermore, it discusses strategies, such as the addition of immunostimulatory adjuvants and the use of potent antigen-delivery systems, that may counteract age-related defects in immune responses to vaccination. A proper understanding of how immunological memory is affected by ageing, and the introduction of strategies to ameliorate vaccine efficacy in the elderly, might reduce the incidence and the severity of infectious disease within this fragile age group and have a strong impact on the quality of life of elderly individuals.","Kovaiou, Rania D; Herndler-Brandstetter, Dietmar; Grubeck-Loebenstein, Beatrix",Expert reviews in molecular medicine,45,33

METHODS Data were collected primarily through telephone interviews with EMS officials throughout the State. To provide a comparison, nine out-of-state emergency services agencies were invited to participate. RESULTS Emergency medical services agencies from nine of the 23 counties (39%) provided responses to some or all of the questions in the telephone survey. Seven of the nine out-of-state agencies provided responses to the survey. Most of the EMS agencies do not have broad, formal plans for response to large-scale bio-terrorist or pandemic events. CONCLUSIONS The findings indicate that EMS agencies in this state fundamentally are unprepared for a large-scale bioterrorism or pandemic event. The few existing plans rely heavily on mutual aid from agencies that may be incapable of providing such aid. Therefore, EMS agencies must be prepared to manage a response to these incidents without assistance from any agencies outside of their local community. In order to accomplish this, they must begin planning and develop close working relationships with public health, healthcare, and elected officials within their local communities.","Maguire, Brian J; Dean, Stephen; Bissell, Richard A; Walz, Bruce J; Bumbak, Andrew K",Prehospital and disaster medicine,45,19

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study METHOD: For this study, data was collected from patients who visited the emergency department (ED) and Cardiac Care Unit of Noordwest Ziekenhuisgroep in Alkmaar and Den Helder. This data collection took place from 1 February to 28 June in 2019 and during the same period in 2020. The number of visits per day was investigated. The outcome measures for hospital occupation were the number of admissions per day and the average length of stay. Outcome measures for health damage were length of stay and mortality. RESULTS The number of ED visits fell by 27% during the lockdown. For the specialties of internal medicine and pulmonary medicine, the number of admissions from the ED was the same during the lockdown, but the length of stay was longer. For all other specialties, the number of admissions from the ED was lower during the lockdown, but the admission duration was the same. Mortality was higher and hospital stay longer for patients admitted to the specialties of internal medicine and pulmonary medicine. In all other specialisms studied, there was no higher mortality or longer hospital stay. CONCLUSION From the start of the lockdown, there was a sharp drop in the number of ED visits. The number of ED visits recovered slowly after this drop. For specialties that did not treat COVID-19 patients, hospital occupation was lower than usual. The number of admissions from the ED had decreased for these specialties. Based on the outcome measures length of stay and mortality, we were unable to find any indications of health damage as a result of the drop in admissions.","Hoogcarspel, S J; Doodeman, H J; Schakenraad, D; de Nooij, L",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,45,31

The source of these neuropeptides have been confined to the contributions of small afferent nerves or possibly neuroendocrine cells. We tested the hypothesis that repeated exposure to allergen would alter the sources and abundance of neuropeptides in airways. Right middle lobes from rats (8 wk old) exposed to 2.5% ovalbumin (OVA) for five episodes (30 min each) or filtered air were inflation fixed with paraformaldehyde. The lobes were dissected to expose the airway tree, permeabilized with DMSO, and incubated in antibody to rat calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), followed with a fluorochrome-labeled second antibody. CGRP-positive structures were imaged via confocal microscopy. Airways were later embedded in plastic and sectioned for cell identification. In animals challenged with OVA, CGRP-positive cells, not neuroendocrine or neuronal in origin (confirmed by a lack of protein gene product 9.5 signal), were recorded along the axial path. In section, this fluorescent signal was localized to granules within epithelial cells. Alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff staining of these same sections positively identify these cells as mucous cells. Mucous cells of animals not challenged with OVA were not positive for CGRP. We conclude that episodic allergen exposure results in the accumulation of CGRP within mucous cells, creating a new source for the release of this neuropeptide within the airway.","Larson, Shawnessy D; Plopper, Charles G; Baker, Greg; Tarkington, Brian K; Decile, Kendra C; Pinkerton, Kent; Mansoor, James K; Hyde, Dallas M; Schelegle, Edward S",American journal of physiology.

Six synthetic peptides (C(1) to C(6)), which reproduced the six IR sequences were used as peptide-based, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antigens. Two IRs, IR(2) and IR(6), were found to be immunodominant. Studies with serially collected serum samples from experimentally infected dogs revealed that the antibody response to IR(6) appears earlier and is stronger than that to IR(2). Thus, the IR(6) sequence alone appeared to be sufficient for serodiagnosis. When C(6) alone was used as antigen, the peptide-based ELISA was positive in 7 of 23 dogs (30%) as early as 3 weeks postinfection. All dogs (n = 33) became strongly positive 1 or 2 weeks later, and this response persisted for the entire study, which lasted for 69 weeks. Of 55 sera submitted by veterinarians from dogs suspected of having Lyme disease, 19 were also positive by the C(6) ELISA, compared to 20 positives detected by immunoblot analysis using cultured B. burgdorferi lysates as antigen. The sensitivity of using C(2) and C(6) together for detecting specific antibody in both experimentally infected and clinically diagnosed dogs was not better than sensitivity with C(6) alone, confirming that C(6) suffices as a diagnostic probe. Moreover, the C(6) ELISA yielded 100% specificity with serum samples collected from 70 healthy dogs, 14 dogs with infections other than B. burgdorferi, and 15 animals vaccinated with either outer surface protein A, whole-spirochete vaccines, or the common puppy-vaccines. Therefore, this C(6) ELISA was both sensitive and specific for the serodiagnosis of canine Lyme disease and could be used with vaccinated dogs.","Liang, F T; Jacobson, R H; Straubinger, R K; Grooters, A; Philipp, M T",Journal of clinical microbiology,45,1

Aerobic exercise interventions have been shown to increase maximal oxygen consumption in selected patients. In addition, preliminary evidence, although mixed, suggests that aerobic exercise training can improve blood pressure control, lipid profiles and mental health in this population. A few larger studies are now available showing that aerobic training can also improve physical functioning and performance. The impact on survival or hospitalisation has not been determined. Resistance exercise training, although less studied, appears to increase muscle strength and size and may also improve functioning. There have been several reports of successful combined exercise interventions, but the designs have not allowed evaluation of the relative benefits of aerobic and resistance training on physical functioning. Despite the evidence that exercise is safe and beneficial in patients with CKD, dialysis patients remain inactive, and exercise assessment, counselling and training is not widely offered to patients with CKD. Studies of the barriers to patient participation in exercise and to provider assessment and recommendations are needed so that more widely generalisable interventions can be developed. However, in the interim, patients should be encouraged to participate in moderate physical activity to meet the US Surgeon General's recommendations. Patients who are weak can benefit from strength-training interventions. Resistance and aerobic exercise programmes should be initiated at relatively low intensity in patients with CKD and progressed as slowly as tolerated in order to avoid injury and discontinuation of exercise.

OBJECTIVES This investigation was undertaken to assess utilization and expenditures for vertebral augmentation procedures, including vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, in the fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare population from 2009 to 2018. STUDY DESIGN The present study was designed to assess utilization and expenditures in all settings, for all providers in the FFS Medicare population from 2009 to 2018 in the United States. In this manuscript:• A patient was described as receiving vertebral augmentation over the course of the year.• An episode was considered as one treatment per region per day utilizing primary codes only. • Services or procedures were considered to be procedures including multiple levels.A standard 5% national sample of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) physician outpatient billing claims data for those enrolled in the FFS Medicare program from 2009 to 2018 was utilized. All the expenditures were presented with allowed costs and adjusted for inflation to 2018 US dollars. RESULTS In 2009, there were 76,860 episodes of vertebral augmentation with a rate of 168 per 100,000 Medicare population, which declined to 58,760, or 99 per 100,000 population for a total decline of 41%, or an annual rate of decline of 5.7% per 100,000 Medicare population. Vertebroplasty interventions declined more dramatically than kyphoplasty from 2009. Total episodes of vertebroplasty were 27,380 with an annual rate of 60 per 100,000 Medicare population, decreasing to 9,240, or 16 per 100,000 Medicare population, a 66% decline in episodes and a 74% decline in overall rate with an annual decline of 11.4% and 13.9%. In contrast, kyphoplasty interventions were 49,480, for a rate per 100,000 population of 108 in 2009 compared to 49,520 in 2018 with a rate of 83, for a decrease of 23% and 2.9% annual decrease. Evaluation of expenditures showed a net decrease of $30,102,809, or 8%, from $378,758,311 in 2009 to $348,655,502 in 2018. However, inflation-adjusted expenditures decreased overall by 21% and 3% annually from $443,147,324 in 2009 to $345,655,502 in 2018. In addition, inflation-adjusted total expenditures per 100,000 Medicare population decreased from $967,549 to $584,992, for an overall decrease of 40%, or an annual decrease of 5%. Per patient expenditures decreased 2% overall with 0% decrease per year. LIMITATIONS Vertebral augmentation procedures were assessed only in the FFS Medicare service population. This excluded over 30% of the Medicare population, which is enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans. CONCLUSIONS This study shows a significant decline in relative utilization patterns of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures, along with reductions in overall expenditures. The inflation-adjusted total expenditures of kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty decreased 21% with an annual decline of 3%. The inflation-adjusted expenditures per 100,000 of Medicare population decreased 40% overall and 5% per year. In addition, vertebroplasty has seen substantial declines in utilization and expenditure patterns compared to kyphoplasty procedures, which showed trends of decline.","Manchikanti, Laxmaiah; Senapathi, Sri Harsha Vardhan; Milburn, James M; Brook, Allan L; Vangala, Brahma Prasad; Pampati, Vidyasagar; Sanapati, Mahendra R; Hirsch, Joshua A",Pain physician,45,1

SARS-CoV-2 Infections and Covid-19 Fatalities in German Districts,20.745367,1.8508192,2020,"First we remind general considerations concerning biodiversity on earth and particularly the loss of genetic biodiversity that seems irreversible whether its origin is directly or indirectly linked to human activities. Urgent and considerable efforts must be made from now on to cataloge, understand, preserve, and enhance the value of biodiversity while ensuring food safety and human and animal health. Ambitious integrated and multifield research programs must be implemented in order to understand the causes and anticipate the consequences of loss of biodiversity. Such losses are a serious threat to sustainable development and to the quality of life of future generations. They have an influence on the natural balance of global biodiversity in particularly in reducing the capability of species to adapt rapidly by genetic mutations to survive in modified ecosystems. Usually, the natural immune systems of mammals (both human and animal), are highly polymorphic and able to adapt rapidly to new situations. We more specifically discuss the fact that if the genetic diversity of the affected populations is low the invading microorganisms, will suddenly expand and create epidemic outbreaks with risks of pandemic. So biodiversity appears to function as an important barrier (buffer), especially against disease-causing organisms, which can function in different ways. Finally, we discuss the importance of preserving biodiversity mainly in the wildlife ecosystems as an integrated and sustainable approach among others in order to prevent and control the emergence or reemergence of diseases in animals and humans (zoonosis). Although plants are also part of this paradigm, they fall outside our field of study.","Maillard, Jean-Charles; Gonzalez, Jean-Paul",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,45,33

However, federal guidelines for licensing IBV vaccines indicate that challenge-virus detection following vaccination is to be conducted in embryonated eggs. In this study, we examined qRT-PCR data with the use of universal and type-specific primers and probe sets for IBV detection and compared those data with challenge-virus detection in embryonated eggs to determine if the two methods of evaluating vaccine efficacy are comparable. In addition, we tested the qRT-PCR assays on thermocyclers from two different manufacturers. We found the universal IBV primers and probe set to be comparable to challenge-virus detection in embryonated eggs. However, for some IBV types (Mass41 and Conn on the SmartCycler II and Ark, Mass41, Conn, and GA98 on the ABI 7500) the qRT-PCR assay was more sensitive than virus detection in embryonated eggs. This may simply be due to the universal IBV qRT-PCR assay being more sensitive than virus detection in eggs or to the assay detecting nucleic acid from nonviable virus. This finding is important and needs to be considered when evaluating challenge-virus detection for vaccination and challenge studies, because qRT-PCR could potentially identify positive birds that would otherwise be negative by virus detection in embryonated eggs; thus it could lead to a more stringent measure of vaccine efficacy. We also found that the IBV type-specific primers and probe sets designed in this study were in general less sensitive than the universal IBV primers and probe set. Only the Ark-DPI-spedcific assay on the SmartCycler II and the Ark-DPI-, Mass41-, and DE072/GA98- (for detection of GA98 virus only) specific assays on the ABI 7500 were comparable in sensitivity to virus detection in eggs. We found that a number of variables, including the virus type examined, primers and probe efficiency and stability, and assay conditions, including thermocycler platform, can affect the data obtained from qRT-PCR assays. These results indicate that qRT-PCR assays can be used to detect IBV challenge virus, but each assay, including the assay conditions and thermocycler, should be individually evaluated if those data are expected to be comparable to virus detection in embryonated eggs.","Roh, Ha-Jung; Hilt, Deborah A; Jackwood, Mark W",Avian diseases,45,26

This allowed us to detect vaccine virus in as few as 3% of the birds in a flock of 20,000 birds with a 95% confidence level. We found that the number of birds positive for IBV vaccine following vaccination in the field resembled a parabolic-shaped curve that peaked around 14 days postvaccination, or it resembled a sinusoidal-type wave with a frequency of about 2 wk. The patterns did not appear to correlate with water or spray vaccination methods, nor did they correlate with the type of backpack sprayer used. The highest number of positive birds in a flock ranged from 66% to 100%. The viral genome copies in the tracheal swabs, as determined by real-time RT-PCR, ranged from 1 x 10(2.6)/ml to 1 x 10(5.2)/ml and, in most studies, had a positive correlation with the number of birds positive for vaccine virus in the flock. On the last sample day of each study, 21, 28, or 35 days postvaccination, from 12% to 66% of the birds were still positive for vaccine virus, and although different IBV vaccine types were used in each study, only Arkansas vaccine virus was identified in selected samples on those days. Arkansas vaccine virus was also the only virus identified in selected samples at 1, 3, and 5 days postvaccination, clearly indicating that Arkansas vaccine virus is persisting in the birds. Protection studies conducted on birds vaccinated with Arkansas- and Delaware-type vaccines and removed from the field at 21 days postvaccination showed complete protection against challenge with Delaware (except for one bird), whereas protection against Arkansas challenge was between 37.5% and 62.5%. Our findings show that introduction of IBV vaccines into a commercial broiler flock do not necessarily follow a seemingly logical pattern of a high number of birds infected followed by clearance from the trachea, but resembled either a parabolic curve or a sinusoidal-type wave. In addition, Arkansas vaccine viruses are clearly persisting in commercial broilers, which may be because of incomplete protection observed for that IBV type.","Jackwood, Mark W; Hilt, Deborah A; McCall, Amber W; Polizzi, Crystal N; McKinley, Enid T; Williams, Susan M",Avian diseases,45,30

The results of all three tests were similar. Serum total protein concentration was directly correlated to gamma globulin concentration and gave the best indication of morbidity and mortality. Thirteen of 13 fawns with serum total protein concentrations of 5 g/dl or less at 1 to 7 days of age developed diarrhea and died before 17 days of age. Only 1 of 14 fawns having a serum protein concentration above this level became sick and died. Seven of 13 fawns that had serum total protein concentrations of 5 g/dl or less, and that had already developed diarrhea, were given 20 ml of plasma per kg body weight. Although this increased their serum gamma globulin concentrations 0.3 g/dl, none survived. Administration of bovine colostrum to one fawn increased its serum gamma globulin concentration suggesting that mule deer fawns are able to absorb gamma globulins from bovine colostrum.","Parkinson, D E; Ellis, R P; Lewis, L D",Journal of wildlife diseases,45,1

The goal of this study is to examine whether and how youth care workers utilize social media communications for reaching out to detached adolescents and providing them emotional support. Qualitative in-depth interviews (N=17) were conducted with counselors, social workers, and clinical psychologists who work with youth at risk. A thematic analysis of the interviews revealed three principal psychosocial usages of social media: (1) Reaching out and maintaining reciprocal and meaningful therapeutic relationships with youth at risk over time; (2) Identifying risks and emotional distress; and (3) ""stepping in"" and providing psychosocial assistance, when needed. These beneficial practices are made possible through the high accessibility and the sense of secured mediation that characterize social media communication and that complement the psychosocial needs of youth at risk. Alongside these advantages, the analysis yielded several significant challenges in social media therapeutic relationships, including privacy dilemmas and blurring of authority and boundaries. Given that social media communication is a relatively new phenomenon, the applied psychosocial practices are shaped through a process of trial and error, intuitive decisions, and peer learning. Although the main conclusion from this study supports the notion that the advantages of social media therapeutic relationships with youth at risk outweigh their problematic aspects, future research is recommended to establish clear guidelines for youth caregivers who wish to integrate the new media in their daily psychosocial work.","Rosenberg, Hananel; Ophir, Yaakov; Billig, Miriam",Child Youth Serv Rev,45,30

In the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, multiple RT-PCR-based tests were developed to screen for viral infection. As an emergency response to increasing testing demand, we established a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR diagnostics platform for which we compared different commercial and in-house RT-PCR protocols. Four commercial, one customized, and one in-house RT-PCR protocols were evaluated with 92 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 92 SARS-CoV-2-negative samples. Furthermore, economical and practical characteristics of these protocols were compared. In addition, a highly sensitive digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) method was developed, and application of RT-PCR and ddPCR methods on SARS-CoV-2 environmental samples was examined. Very low limits of detection (1 or 2 viral copies/µL), high sensitivities (93.6% to 97.8%), and high specificities (98.7% to 100%) for the tested RT-PCR protocols were found. Furthermore, the feasibility of downscaling two of the commercial protocols, which could optimize testing capacity, was demonstrated. Tested commercial and customized RT-PCR detection kits show very good and comparable sensitivity and specificity, and the kits could be further optimized for use on SARS-CoV-2 viral samples derived from human and surface swabbed samples.","Tastanova, Aizhan; Stoffel, Corinne Isabelle; Dzung, Andreas; Cheng, Phil Fang; Bellini, Elisa; Johansen, Pål; Duda, Agathe; Nobbe, Stephan; Lienhard, Reto; Bosshard, Philipp Peter; Levesque, Mitchell P",J Mol Diagn,45,24

We performed a retrospective study of 2880 cases of COVID-19 admitted in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China, among which 922 had detected the HbA1c levels. We found that COVID-19 patients with either lower levels of HbAlc (3%-4.9%) or higher levels of HbAlc (&#8805;6%) were associated with elevated all-cause mortality. Meanwhile, we observed that HbAlc levels were highly correlated with haemoglobin (Hb) and total cholesterol (TC) (P < .0001), moderately correlated with albumin (ALB) and high-sensitive C reaction protein (hs-CRP) (0.0001 < P<.001), and relatively low correlated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (.001 < P<.01).

Previous research has demonstrated that framing could influence perception and behaviors of audience members in the mass media. The question addressed in this paper concerns which information frame is best for reporting negative news (eg, deaths) and positive news (eg, recoveries or cures) related to the outbreak of COVID-19. Methods: During the Spring Festival holidays of 2020 in China, we investigated a sample of 8170 participants’ risk perceptions and emotional responses to the pandemic, and their willingness to forward updates when the information is presented in different frames by using a 2 (domain: living [good news] vs dying [bad news]) × 2 (count: absolute vs relative) × 2 (population base: excluding population base vs including population base) × 2 (content: text-only vs text-plus-graphic) mixed factorial design, with the first factor being a within-subjects factor and the last three being between-subjects factors. Results: Results indicated that (1) participants were more willing to forward good news (eg, cures) than bad news (eg, deaths);(2) when reporting bad news, the inclusion of the “population base” was effective in minimizing negative emotions;(3) when reporting good news, excluding the “population base” was more effective than including it in order to maximize positive emotions;(4) a text-plus-graphic frame worked better than a text-only frame in lowering the level of risk perception and negative emotions.

Due to economic pressure, the government of India had to implement a policy of relaxing control during the rising period of the epidemic. This paper proposes a compartment model to study the development of COVID-19 in India after relaxing control. The Sigmoid function reflecting the cumulative effect is used to characterize the model-based diagnosis rate, cure rate and mortality rate. Considering the influence of the lockdown on the model parameters, the data are fitted using the method of least squares before and after the lockdown. According to numerical simulation and model analysis, the impact of India's relaxation of control before and after the inflection point is studied. Research shows that adopting a relaxation policy prematurely will have disastrous consequences. Even if the degree of relaxation is only 5% before the inflection point, it will increase the number of deaths by 15.03%. If the control is relaxed after the inflection point, the higher degree of relaxation, the more likely a secondary outbreak will occur, which will extend the duration of the pandemic, leading to more deaths and put more pressure on the health care system. It is found that after the implementation of the relaxation policy, medical quarantine capability and public cooperation are two vital indicators. The results show that if the supply of kits and detection speed can be increased after the control is relaxed, the secondary outbreak can be effectively avoided. Meanwhile, the increase in public cooperation can significantly reduce the spread of the virus, suppress the second outbreak of the pandemic and reduce the death toll. It is of reference significance to the government's policy formulation.","Yu, Xinchen; Qi, Guoyuan; Hu, Jianbing",Nonlinear Dyn,45,30

Public deliberations and controversies about models and their projections are illuminating. These help trace how projections are ‘made multiple’ in their enactments as ‘public troubles’. We need an approach to evidence-making for policy which is emergent and adaptive, and which treats science as an entangled effect of public concern made in social practices.

However, no report is currently available regarding the direct effects of HCQ on gut microbiota, which is associated with the outcomes of elderly patients with COVID-19. Here, we first investigated the effects of HCQ on intestinal microecology in mice. MAIN METHODS: Fifteen female C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into two groups: HCQ group (n = 10) and control group (n = 5). Mice in the HCQ group were administered with HCQ at dose of 100 mg/kg by gavage daily for 14 days. The feces of mice were collected before and on the 7th and 14th days after HCQ challenge, and then analyzed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. At the end of the experiment, the hematology, serum biochemistry and cytokines were determined, respectively. The mRNA expression of tight junction proteins in colonic tissues were also studied by RT-PCR. KEY FINDINGS: HCQ challenge had no effects on the counts of white blood cells, the levels of serum cytokines, and the gene expression of tight junction proteins in colon. HCQ also did not increase the content of serum d-lactate in mice. Notably, HCQ significantly decreased the diversity of gut microbiota, increased the relative abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes whereas decreased that of Firmicutes. SIGNIFICANCE: Short-term high dose HCQ challenge changes gut microbiota but not the intestinal integrity and immunological responses in mice. Special attention should be paid to the effects of HCQ on intestinal microecology in future clinical use.","Pan, Zhi-Yuan; Chang, Yu-Xiao; Han, Ni; Hou, Feng-Yi; Lee, B J Yang; Zhi, Fa-Chao; Yang, Rui-Fu; Bi, Yu-Jing",Life Sci,45,30

Using SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses, we confirmed that isolated human islet cells are permissive to infection. In eleven COVID-19 patients, we examined the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS and other receptors and factors, such as DPP4, HMBG1 and NRP1, that might facilitate virus entry. Whereas 70% of the COVID-19 patients expressed ACE2 in the vasculature, only 30% displayed ACE2-expression in beta-cells. Even in the absence of manifest new-onset diabetes, necroptotic cell death, immune cell infiltration and SARS-CoV-2 viral infection of pancreatic beta-cells may contribute to varying degrees of metabolic dysregulation in patients with COVID-19.","Steenblock, Charlotte; Richter, Stefanie; Berger, Ilona; Barovic, Marko; Schmid, Janine; Schubert, Undine; Jarzebska, Natalia; von Mässenhausen, Anne; Linkermann, Andreas; Schürmann, Annette; Pablik, Jessica; Dienemann, Thomas; Evert, Katja; Rodionov, Roman N; Semenova, Natalia Y; Zinserling, Vsevolod A; Gainetdinov, Raul R; Baretton, Gustavo; Lindemann, Dirk; Solimena, Michele; Ludwig, Barbara; Bornstein, Stefan R",Nat Commun,45,1

The challenges faced by patients with prolonged COVID-19-related hospitalizations - social isolation, disability, neurologic sequelae, adjustment-related anxiety, depression, and stress - may be mitigated by the novel use of VR as one modality of a comprehensive rehabilitation plan. This descriptive study aimed to understand patient satisfaction and perceived benefit of virtual reality on a COVID-19 recovery unit, as well as the logistical and operational feasibility of providing VR content for patients and staff. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the COVID-19 surge in New York City in 2020, the COVID-19 Recovery Unit (CRU) of a large academic hospital invited patients and staff to participate in VR sessions with three categories of experience: (1) Guided meditation, (2) Exploration of natural environments, (3) Cognitive stimulation games. Patients and staff were surveyed about satisfaction and perceived benefit. RESULTS: 13 patients and 11 staff were surveyed, with median patient satisfaction scores of 9 out of 10, with ten representing ""extremely satisfied,"" and median staff satisfaction scores of 10. 13/13 patients answered ""yes"" to recommending the therapy to others, and 12/13 answered ""yes"" to perceived enhancement of their treatment. 11/11 staff answered ""yes"" to recommending the therapy to others, and 11/11 answered ""yes"" to perceived enhancement of their wellbeing. DISCUSSION: A VR program implemented on a COVID-19 rehabilitation unit for patients and healthcare providers was rated as highly satisfactory with perceived benefit by survey respondents. Participants commented that the use of VR was useful in coping with isolation and loneliness, and could be implemented within the context of clinical care for COVID-19 patients as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation model. The use of VR was also logistically and operationally feasible on the CRU. Future work to compare benefits of VR to standard neuropsychological rehabilitation is needed.","Kolbe, Laura; Jaywant, Abhishek; Gupta, Alka; Vanderlind, W Michael; Jabbour, Gina",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,45,1

The potential of anaerobic digestion (AD) to remove antibiotics and ARGs was investigated through tetracycline (TC) and sulfadimethoxine (SDM) additions into dairy manure digested for 44 d. This was the first study to evaluate antibiotics at concentrations quantified on-farm and relevant to field applications of manure. Triplicate treatments included a 1 mg L-1 TC spike, a 10 mg L-1 TC spike, a 1 mg L-1 SDM spike (SDM 1), a 10 mg L-1 SDM spike, a mixture of TC and SDM at 1 mg L-1 each (TC+SDM 1), and a manure-only treatment. The SDM spikes were reduced by >99% reduction during the AD processing, but TC additions had variable reductions (0-96%). Molecular analyses showed that decreases in tetM gene copies correlated with declines in TC; however, reductions in SDM concentration did not correlate with decreases in sul1 gene copy concentrations. The AD reactors containing 10 mg L-1 of TC and 10 mg L-1 of SDM both had CH4 production reductions of 7.8%, whereas no CH4 reduction was observed in other treatments (1 mg L-1 treatments). The study results were the first to confirm that AD can remove SDM when adding at concentrations observed in on-farm manure (<1 mg L-1 ) without compromising energy production. Because TC adsorbs to the solid particles and transforms into isomers, the decreases in TC concentrations were more variable and should be closely monitored.","Schueler, Jenna; Lansing, Stephanie; Crossette, Emily; Naas, Kayla; Hurst, Jerod; Raskin, Lutgarde; Wigginton, Krista; Aga, Diana S",,45,22

Recently the Ddimer test has been used as a marker of inflammation in COVID-19 pneumonia and has been shown to correlate with worse outcomes. An understanding of trajectories and relation to clot burden and outcomes of this novel use of serial measurements of D-dimer in COVID-19 ICU patients remains to be explored. Methods: We reviewed patients who were admitted to the Northwestern Hospital COVID ICUs from 3/1/20 to 7/31/20. We obtained demographics, d-dimer lab values, venous duplex studies from upper and lower extremities (UE/LE dopplers), CT-angiogram (CTA) reports, and mortality outcomes from our electronic medical record database. Reports were processed using string analysis with manual physician validation. Analysis was done in R with nonparametric numeric variables being compared by two-tailed Mann Whitney tests. Results: We had 370 patients in our cohort, with median (interquartile range (IQR)) age being 60 (49-69), 229/370 (62%) male, 128 (35%) of Hispanic ethnicity, 117 (32%) of African-American ethnicity, and 135 (36%) of Caucasian descent. 70 patients died (19%). The total number of VTE imaging tests included: 87 CTAs, 102 UE dopplers, and 232 LE dopplers. Clot was discovered in 43/102 (42%) UE dopplers, 62/232 (27%) of LE dopplers, and 25/87 (29%) of CTAs. Patients underwent a median of 2 (1-3) imaging studies, and 10 (4-20) d-dimer measurements. 79 unique patients (21%) had VTE detected. There was no statistically significant difference in age between the clot vs noclot groups: 57(45-68) vs 61(49-59) years, p=0.34, or BMI: 30.5(25.6-34.8) in clot vs 29(25.4-34.5) kg/m2 in no-clot group (p=0.55). Mortality was significantly higher at 36% in the clot group vs 15% in the group without clot (p&lt;0.005). Hospital length of stay in the group with clot was significantly longer at 30.5(20.3-43.5) days vs no-clot 14(7.9-18.5) days (p&lt;0.0001). The clot group had higher initial d-dimer values 2,236(752-3,654) ng/ml than the no-clot group 757(395-1,940) (p&lt;0.0001), and also higher peak d-dimer values 9,476(3,353-16,595) vs 2,113(686-3,689) ng/ml (p&lt;0.0001). Conclusion: Critically ill COVID-19 patients exhibit a high rate of clot formation.

Synergetically using these individual components along with robust representation and data generation techniques autonomously in closed loops holds enormous promise for accelerated drug design which is a time consuming and expensive task otherwise. In this perspective, we present the most recent breakthrough achieved by each of the components, and how such autonomous AI and ML workflow can be realized to radically accelerate the hit identification and lead optimization. Taken together, this could significantly shorten the timeline for end-to-end antiviral discovery and optimization times to weeks upon the arrival of a novel zoonotic transmission event.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients admitted to 2 new RICUs built specifically in our institution to face the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, from April 1 until May 30, 2020. RESULTS: During this period, 106 COVID-19 patients were admitted to these 2 RICUs, 65 of them (61%) transferred from an ICU (step-down) and 41 (39%) from the ward or emergency room (step-up). Most of them (72%) were male and mean age was 66 ± 12 years. 31% of them required support with oxygen therapy via high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and 14% non-invasive ventilation (NIV). 42 of the 65 patients stepping down (65%) had a previous tracheostomy performed and most of them (74%) were successfully decannulated during their stay in the RICU. Length of stay was 7 [4-11] days. 90-day mortality was 19% being significantly higher in stepping up patients than in those transferred from the ICU (25 vs. 10% respectively; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: RICUs are a valuable hospital resource to respond to the challenges of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic both to treat deteriorating and recovering COVID-19 patients.","Matute-Villacís, Mónica; Moisés, Jorge; Embid, Cristina; Armas, Judith; Fernández, Isabel; Medina, Montserrat; Ferrer, Miquel; Sibila, Oriol; Badia, Joan Ramón",BMC Pulm Med,45,22

We find that, although generally very pessimistic, a substantial proportion of individuals believes that their households' economy will be doing substantially better than the national and global economy, suggesting a ""financial better-than-average"" effect. Furthermore, we find that the pessimism regarding future household economic situation and being financially ignorant are associated with decreased financial well-being, while the (inter)national economic situation is not.

COVID-19, which initially started in Wuhan City of China and then spread to the whole world, has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The continuous increase in the number of confirmed cases leads to high mortality across the world. Growing evidence indicates that the mortality rate is very predominant in elderly people and those with preexisting health conditions. However, the potential pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is still unknown. The dysregulated/exuberant immune response may have substantially contributed to the SARS-CoV-2-mediated pathology. Nevertheless, there is no clinically approved drug/vaccine currently available that can restrict its pathogenesis. However, several drugs are currently shown to provide some therapeutic benefits for COVID-19 patients, including antiviral drugs that might have a significant role in restricting the current pandemic of COVID-19.

METHODS: Data were taken from the Hamburg survey of homeless individuals (n = 100 individuals in the here used model, mean age 44.8 years, SD 12.5) focusing on homeless individuals in Hamburg, Germany. The number of physician visits in the past 3 months and hospitalization in the preceding 12 months were used as outcome measures. Drawing on the Andersen model of health care use as a conceptual framework, predisposing characteristics, enabling resources and need factors as well as psychosocial variables were included as correlates. RESULTS: Negative binomial regressions showed that increased physician visits were associated with being female (IRR: 4.02 [95% CI: 1.60-10.11]), absence of chronic alcohol consume (IRR: 0.26 [95% CI: 0.12-0.57]) and lower health-related quality of life (IRR: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.96-0.98]). Furthermore, logistic regressions showed that the likelihood of hospitalization was positively associated with lower age (OR: 0.93 [95% CI: 0.89-0.98]), having health insurance (OR: 8.11 [2.11-30.80]) and lower health-related quality of life (OR: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.94-0.99]). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that predisposing characteristics (both age and sex), enabling resources (i.e., health insurance) and need factors in terms of health-related quality of life are main drivers of health care use among homeless individuals.

However, for vaccination efforts to succeed, there must be widespread willingness to vaccinate. Prior research has found that Black Americans, who are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, report lower intentions to get a vaccine than do other populations. We investigate two potential contributors to this disparity: COVID-19 vaccine-related behavioral beliefs and trust in four COVID-19 information sources (mainstream media, social media, President Trump, and public health officials and agencies). Using a nationally-representative survey (n= 889), we demonstrate that differences in vaccination beliefs explain the lower vaccination intentions reported by Black participants, compared to non-Black participants. However, while trust in information sources is associated with vaccination beliefs, differences in trust do not account for the observed differences in vaccination beliefs by race. Furthermore, we find that race moderates the relationships between trust in two sources (Trump and public health officials and agencies) and vaccination beliefs. The effects of trusting these sources on COVID-19 vaccine-related beliefs are smaller among Black participants; thus trust in these sources is less consequential to their pro-vaccination beliefs. Our results suggest that trust in information sources alone does not explain the observed relationship between race and vaccination beliefs.","Woko, Chioma; Siegel, Leeann; Hornik, Robert",J Health Commun,45,1

ACE2 is a multifunctional monocarboxypeptidase responsible for generating Ang-(1-7) from Ang II. ACE2 is important in the vascular system where it is found in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in many vascular beds. Among the best characterized functions of ACE2 is its role in regulating vascular tone. ACE2 through its effector peptide Ang-(1-7) and receptor Mas1 induces vasodilation and attenuates Ang II-induced vasoconstriction. In endothelial cells activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas1 axis increases production of the vasodilator's nitric oxide and prostacyclin's and in vascular smooth muscle cells it inhibits pro-contractile and pro-inflammatory signaling. Endothelial ACE2 is cleaved by proteases, shed into the circulation and measured as soluble ACE2. Plasma ACE2 activity is increased in cardiovascular disease and may have prognostic significance in disease severity. In addition to its enzymatic function, ACE2 is the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV) and SARS-Cov-2, which cause SARS and coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) respectively. ACE-2 is thus a double-edged sword: it promotes cardiovascular health while also facilitating the devastations caused by coronaviruses. COVID-19 is associated with cardiovascular disease as a risk factor and as a complication. Mechanisms linking COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease are unclear, but vascular ACE2 may be important. This review focuses on the vascular biology and (patho)physiology of ACE2 in cardiovascular health and disease and briefly discusses the role of vascular ACE2 as a potential mediator of vascular injury in COVID-19.","Kuriakose, Jithin; Montezano, Augusto C; Touyz, Rhian M",Clin Sci (Lond),45,16

ODC is activated by antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1) and 2 (AZIN2). AZIN1 and recently AZIN2 have been related to cancer, however, their functions in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) have not been studied. We evaluated the immunoexpression of AZIN1 and 2 in tumor tissue from ACC patients, and related the results to clinical and clinicopathological features and patient survival. STUDY DESIGN: We performed immunohistochemical study on minor salivary and mucous gland ACC tissue samples of patients treated at the Helsinki University Hospital (Helsinki, Finland) during 1974-2012. We scored AZIN1 and 2 immunoexpression in 42 and 45 tumor tissue samples, respectively, and correlated them with clinicopathological factors and survival. RESULTS: Enhanced AZIN2 expression was associated with better survival. In addition, both AZINs were seen more commonly in cribriform and tubular than in solid growth patterns. AZIN1 expression did not correlate with the studied clinicopathological factors. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that AZIN2 expression is higher in cancer tissue with secretory functions. In ACC tissue, high AZIN2 expression could be related to well-differentiated histological type which still has a functioning vesicle transportation system. Thus, AZIN2 could be a prognostic factor for better survival of ACC patients.","Hämetoja, Hanna; Andersson, Leif C; Mäkitie, Antti; Bäck, Leif; Hagström, Jaana; Haglund, Caj",APMIS acta pathol. microbiol. immunol. scand,45,3

In particular, aged individuals and individuals with comorbidities, including obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, have significantly higher risks of hospitalization and death than normal individuals. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), belonging to the RAS family, has received much attention during this COVID-19 pandemic, owing to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a receptor for cellular entry. Additionally, the RAS greatly affects energy metabolism in certain pathological conditions, including cardiac failure, diabetes mellitus, and viral infections. This article discusses the potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 modulates the RAS and energy metabolism in individuals with obesity and diabetes mellitus. The article aims to highlight the appropriate strategies for combating the COVID-19 pandemic in the clinical setting and emphasize on the areas that require further investigation in relation to COVID-19 infections in patients with obesity and diabetes mellitus from the viewpoint of endocrinology and metabolism.","Mori, Jun; Oudit, Gavin Y; Lopaschuk, Gary D",Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab,45,27

This knowledge offers an unprecedented opportunity to disrupt entrenched strategies and to reinvest in MNCH in the post-COVID-19 so-called new normal. Furthermore, analysis of the short-term, medium-term, and longer-term consequences of previous socioeconomic shocks provides important insights into those domains of MNCH, such as neurocognitive development and nutrition, for which investment will generate the greatest benefit.

Proper triage of patients with possible COVID-19 via chief complaint is critical but not fully optimized. This study aimed to investigate the association between presentation by chief complaints and COVID-19 status. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed adult emergency department (ED) patient visits from five different NYC hospital campuses from March 1, 2020 to May 13, 2020 of patients who underwent nasopharyngeal COVID-19 RT-PCR testing. The positive and negative COVID-19 cohorts were then assessed for different chief complaints obtained from structured triage data. Sub-analysis was performed for patients older than 65 and within chief complaints with high mortality. RESULTS: Of 11,992 ED patient visits who received COVID-19 testing, 6524/11992 (54.4%) were COVID-19 positive. 73.5% of fever, 67.7% of shortness of breath, and 65% of cough had COVID-19, but others included 57.5% of weakness/fall/altered mental status, 55.5% of glycemic control, and 51.4% of gastrointestinal symptoms. In patients over 65, 76.7% of diarrhea, 73.7% of fatigue, and 69.3% of weakness had COVID-19. 45.5% of dehydration, 40.5% of altered mental status, 27% of fall, and 24.6% of hyperglycemia patients experienced mortality. CONCLUSION: A novel high risk COVID-19 patient population was identified from chief complaint data, which is different from current suggested CDC guidelines, and may help triage systems to better isolate COVID-19 patients. Older patients with COVID-19 infection presented with more atypical complaints warranting special consideration. COVID-19 was associated with higher mortality in a unique group of complaints also warranting special consideration.","Clifford, Christopher T; Pour, Trevor R; Freeman, Robert; Reich, David L; Glicksberg, Benjamin S; Levin, Matthew A; Klang, Eyal",Am. j. emerg. med,45,26

An ad hoc questionnaire was administered. The participants were 1046 people (48.57% male and 51.43% female) and the average age of 40 (+or- DT 13.35 years). Regarding the practice of physical activity, a significant decrease in intensity and quantity stands out (p < .001), and a modification of the type of physical activity performed, going from cardiovascular sports and muscular fitness to soft gymnastics and flexibility practices. The total percentage of people who did no physical activity at all, increased. In addition, although more free time was available, people in ERTE situation significantly decreased their amount of physical activity performed (p < .001). These results allow us to conclude that confinement has meant a modification of physical activity practice habits and a decrease in the recommended values healthy healthy, and therefore has had implications on health and quality of life.

Patients were divided into severe group and critically-severe group according to the severity of illness. Age-matched healthy volunteers were recruited as a control group. The cardiac cavity diameters, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), tricuspid valve regurgitation pressure gradient biggest (TRPG), pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP), maximum inferior vena cava diameter (IVCmax) and minimum diameter (IVCmin), and inferior vena cava collapse index (ICV-CI) were measured using echocardiography. We found that the TAPSE was significantly decreased in pneumonia patients compared to healthy subjects (P < 0.0001), and it was significantly lower in critically-severe patients (P = 0.0068). The TAPSE was less than 17 mm in three (8.6%) severe and five (35.7%) critically-severe patients. In addition, the TAPSE was significantly decreased in severe ARDS patients than in mild ARDS patients. The IVCmax and IVCmin were significantly increased in critically-severe patients compared to healthy subjects and severe patients (P < 0.01), whereas the ICV-CI was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). COVID-19 patients had significantly larger right atrium and ventricle than healthy controls (P < 0.01). The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in critically-severe patients was significantly lower than that in severe patients and healthy controls (P < 0.05).

However, reports on practical large-scale group testing for SARS-CoV-2 have been scant. Key open questions concern reduced sensitivity due to sample dilution, the rate of false positives, the actual efficiency (number of tests saved by pooling), and the impact of infection rate in the population on assay performance. Here, we report an analysis of 133,816 samples collected between April and September 2020 and tested by Dorfman pooling for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We spared 76% of RNA extraction and RT-PCR tests, despite the frequently changing prevalence (0.5 to 6%). We observed pooling efficiency and sensitivity that exceeded theoretical predictions, which resulted from the nonrandom distribution of positive samples in pools.

The dynamic nature of the component elements of wind farms and considering the risks interdependencies motivate this combination. A questionnaire survey targeting experts is conducted for calculating the modified Risk Priority Numbers (RPNs). Thirty-four factors are ranked, and the nine CSFs identified as “Political instability”, “Sanctions”, “Economic insecurity”, “Interest rate fluctuations”, “Exchange rate fluctuations”, “Inflation rate fluctuations”, “Feasibility risk”, “Shortage of capital risk”, and “Supplier risk”. The values of RPNT = 260.26, RPNC = 251.31, and RPNQ = 238.77 indicate that “Exchange rate fluctuations” is the most important critical risk. The second one, is “Political instability” with RPNT = 255.35, RPNC = 247.28, and RPNQ = 230.56. The simulation results of a 50 MW wind farm reveal, with a 90% confidence level, “Sanctions” would cause 43.9% increase in project execution time and 28% decrease in project quality, and “Shortage of capital risk” has the greatest impact on project cost, with a 25.79% increase. This work further proposes several strategies to respond to the CRs and concludes that investments in REs can support post-COVID-19 economic recovery.","Zeinalnezhad, Masoomeh Chofreh Abdoulmohammad Gholamzadeh Goni Feybi Ariani Hashemi Leila Sadat Klemeš Jiří Jaromír",Energy,45,22

Curtailment of intensive care unit (ICU) access threatens complex surgery, particularly impacting on outcomes for time-sensitive cancer surgery. Oesophageal cancer surgery is a good example. This study explored the impact of the pandemic on process and short-term surgical outcomes, comparing the first wave of the pandemic from April to June in 2020 with the same period in 2019. METHODS: Data from all four Irish oesophageal cancer centres were reviewed. All patients undergoing resection for oesophageal malignancy from 1 April to 30 June inclusive in 2020 and 2019 were included. Patient, disease, and peri-operative outcomes (including COVID-19 infection) were compared. RESULTS: In 2020, 45 patients underwent oesophagectomy, and 53 in the equivalent period in 2019. There were no differences in patient demographics, co-morbidities, or use of neoadjuvant therapy. The median time to surgery from neoadjuvant therapy was 8 weeks in both 2020 and 2019. There were no significant differences in operative interventions between the two time periods. There was no difference in operative morbidity in 2020 and 2019 (28% vs 40%, p = 0.28). There was no in-hospital mortality in either period. No patient contracted COVID-19 in the perioperative period. CONCLUSIONS: Continuing surgical resection for oesophageal cancer was feasible and safe during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland. The national response to this threat was therefore successful by these criteria in the curative management of oesophageal cancer.","Bolger, Jarlath C; Donlon, Noel E; Butt, Waqas; Neary, Colm; Al Azzawi, Mohammed; Brett, Orla; King, Sinead; Downey, Eithne; Arumugasamy, Mayilone; Murphy, Thomas; Robb, William B; Collins, Chris G; Carroll, Paul A; Donohoe, Claire L; Ravi, Narayanasamy; Reynolds, John V",Ir. j. med. sci,45,1

Among the modulable factors, diet has been identified as a key regulator of microbiota composition in patients with metabolic syndrome and related diseases, including the metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). The altered microbiota disrupts the intestinal barrier at different levels inducing functional and structural changes at the mucus lining, the intercellular junctions on the epithelial layer, or at the recently characterized vascular barrier. Barrier disruption leads to an increased gut permeability to bacteria and derived products which challenge the immune system and promote inflammation.

While control measures, such as quarantine, lockdown and social distancing, reduce infections and infection-related deaths, they have severe negative economic and social consequences. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to explore the acceptability of different infectious disease control measures, and examine how respondents trade off between economic and health outcomes. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was developed, with attributes covering: control restrictions, duration of restrictions, tracking, number of infections and of deaths, unemployment, government expenditure and additional personal tax. A representative sample of Australians (n = 1046) completed the survey, which included eight choice tasks. Data were analysed using mixed logit regression to identify heterogeneity and latent class models to examine heterogeneity. RESULTS: In general, respondents had strong preferences for policies that avoided high infection-related deaths, although lower unemployment and government expenditure were also considered important. Respondents preferred a shorter duration for restrictions, but their preferences did not vary significantly for the differing levels of control measures. In terms of tracking, respondents preferred mobile phone tracking or bracelets when compared to no tracking. Significant differences in preferences was identified, with two distinct classes: Class 1 (57%) preferred the economy to remain open with some control measures, whereas Class 2 (43%), had stronger preferences for policies that reduced avoidable deaths. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the Australian population is willing to relinquish some freedom, in the short term, and trade off the negative social and economic impacts of the pandemic, to avoid the negative health consequences.","Manipis, Kathleen; Street, Deborah; Cronin, Paula; Viney, Rosalie; Goodall, Stephen",Patient,45,20

We also find that the countrywide distribution of cases across states/provinces in these nations also displays similar inequality, indicating self-similarity across scales. Neighbourhoods with slums are found to contain the highest density of cases across all cities under consideration, revealing that slums constitute the most at-risk urban locations in this epidemic. We present a stochastic network model to study the spread of a respiratory epidemic through physically proximate and accidental daily human contacts in a city, and simulate outcomes for a city with two kinds of neighbourhoods-slum and non-slum. The model reproduces observed empirical outcomes for a broad set of parameter values-reflecting the potential validity of these findings for epidemic spread in general, especially across cities of the developing world. We also find that distribution of cases becomes less unequal as the epidemic runs its course, and that both peak and cumulative caseloads are worse for slum neighbourhoods than non-slums at the end of an epidemic. Large slums in the developing world, therefore, contain the most vulnerable populations in an outbreak, and the continuing growth of metropolises in Asia and Africa presents significant challenges for future respiratory outbreaks from perspectives of public health and socioeconomic equity.","Sahasranaman, Anand; Jensen, Henrik Jeldtoft",J R Soc Interface,45,1

Against this background Verity et al. (2020, Lancet Infections Diseases) have rapidly assembled case data and used statistical modelling to infer the IFR for COVID-19. We have attempted an in-depth statistical review of their approach, to identify to what extent the data are sufficiently informative about the IFR to play a greater role than the modelling assumptions, and have tried to identify those assumptions that appear to play a key role. Given the difficulties with other data sources, we provide a crude alternative analysis based on the Diamond Princess Cruise ship data and case data from China, and argue that, given the data problems, modelling of clinical data to obtain the IFR can only be a stop-gap measure.

India has also achieved a significant reduction in malaria burden in 2018 and has committed to eliminate malaria by 2030. The Mandla Malaria Elimination Demonstration Project (MEDP) was started in 2017 in 1233 villages of District Mandla to demonstrate malaria elimination in a tribal district with hard-to-reach areas was possible using active and passive surveillance, case management, vector control, and targeted information, education and communication campaigns. An operational plan was developed to strengthen the existing surveillance and malaria elimination systems, through fortnightly active case detection to ensure that all cases including those that are introduced into the communities are rapidly identified and treated promptly. The plan also focused on the reduction of human-mosquito contact through the use of Long-Lasting Insecticial Nets (LLINs) and Indoor Residual Spray (IRS). The operational plan was modified in view of the present COVID-19 pandemic by creating systems of assistance for the local administration for COVID-related work while ensuring the operational integrity of malaria elimination efforts. RESULTS: The use of MEDP study design and operational plan, with its built-in management control systems, has yielded significant (91%) reduction of indigenous cases of malaria during the period from June 2017 to May 2020. The malaria positivity rate was 0.33% in 2017-18, 0.13% in 2018-19, and 0.06% in 2019-20. Mass screening revealed 0.18% malaria positivity in September-October 2018, followed by 0.06% in June 2019, and 0.03% in December 2019, and these were mostly asymptomatic cases in the community. The project has been able to sustain the gains of the past three years during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: This paper provides the study design and the operational plan for malaria elimination in a high-burden district of Central India, which presented difficulties of hard to reach areas, forest malaria, and complex epidemiology of urban and rural malaria. The lessons learned could be used for malaria elimination efforts in rest of the country and other parts of South Asia with comparable demography and epidemiology.","Rajvanshi, Harsh; Bharti, Praveen K; Nisar, Sekh; Jain, Yashpal; Jayswar, Himanshu; Mishra, Ashok K; Sharma, Ravendra K; Saha, Kalyan B; Shukla, Man Mohan; Das, Aparup; Kaur, Harpreet; Wattal, Suman L; Singh, Neeru; Lal, Altaf A",Malar J,45,1

The reason for this proposal is the usual scientific argument claiming that these trials are the most efficient method to obtain reliable results, and individuals in these countries will continue to get the local standard of care, meaning no vaccination, and thus participants are not being left worse off. We refute this argument on two counts. First the global equity and justice issue, that the scarcity of vaccines in most countries is created by the rich nations that have hoarded vaccines. Second, the science versus research ethics issue, that there are valid scientific methods like non-inferiority trials which can give reliable results, and that applying a standard of care imposed by rich nations is both unethical and possibly exploitative. Thus, we feel that the WHO Ad Hoc Expert Group is wrong in proposing to continue placebo-controlled Covid-19 vaccine trials.","Ahmad, Aasim; Dhrolia, Murtaza F",Indian J Med Ethics,45,13

Purpose: To synthesize empirical research from disparate sources that describes public perceptions of ACP, palliative care, and hospice in ways that could inform public messaging. Data Sources: Searches of PubMed and other databases were made from January 2011 to January 2020. Study Selection: Studies reporting survey or interview data with the public that asked specifically about awareness and attitudes toward ACP, palliative care, or hospice were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two reviewers independently screened citations, read full texts, and performed data abstraction. Twelve studies met inclusion criteria and included >9800 participants. For ACP, 80% to 90% of participants reported awareness, and a similar proportion considered it important, but only 10% to 41% reported having named a proxy or completed a written document. For palliative care, 66% to 71% of participants reported no awareness of palliative care, and those who reported awareness often conflated it with end-of-life care. However, after being prompted with a tested definition, 95% rated palliative care favorably. For hospice, 86% of participants reported awareness and 70% to 91% rated it favorably, although 37% held significant misconceptions. Limitations: A limited number of studies met inclusion criteria, and some were published in nonpeer reviewed sources. The studies reflect public perceptions pre-COVID-19. Conclusion: Consumer perceptions of ACP, palliative care, and hospice each have a distinct profile of awareness, perceptions of importance, and reports of action taking, and these profiles represent three different challenges for public messaging.","Grant, Marian S; Back, Anthony L; Dettmar, Nicole S",J. palliat. med,45,14

During laparoscopic gastrostomy, it is standard to perform gastropexy, apposing visceral and parietal peritoneum. In some settings, due to altered anatomy from prior surgery, direct apposition of the stomach to the abdominal wall is not possible. This study reports a series of cases where laparoscopic gastrostomy was performed via a Witzel approach without gastropexy. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients at a tertiary academic medical center who underwent Witzel gastrostomy without gastropexy over a 3-year period. In each case, an 18-French tube was placed into the fundus of the stomach and secured with a purse-string suture. A 5-cm serosalized Witzel tunnel was created around the tube using running silk suture. No gastropexy was performed. RESULTS: Six patients underwent 7 Witzel gastrostomy procedures. In three cases, patients had undergone prior major upper abdominal surgery where adhesive disease prevented gastropexy. In the other four cases, the patients had undergone prior gastric bypass with antecolic antegastric position of the roux limb. No patient suffered leak of gastric contents into the peritoneum, and there were no postoperative complications or mortality related to the gastrostomy. CONCLUSION: In cases where enteral access is necessary, and where the stomach cannot reach the anterior abdominal wall for gastropexy due to prior surgeries, a Witzel gastrostomy without gastropexy is a safe option which resulted in no morbidity or mortality in our series.","Davies, Joshua; Pernar, Luise; Eble, Danielle; Fernandez, Adolfo Z; Carmine, Brian; Hess, Donald; Carter, Cullen",Obes. surg,45,7

In this context, there are major concerns for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly for those treated with immunomodulators, biologics, and Janus Kinase inhibitors. Infection susceptibility is, in fact, one of the reported risks for immunotherapy drugs. This review provides the existing evidence from worldwide case series describing: (a) the risk for the SARS-CoV-2 infection and (b) the risk of a severe infection outcome in patients with IBD treated with immunotherapy. Further, the review discusses the potential mechanisms underlying why this group of patients with IBD might be protected from contracting the infection and from a worse disease. From the available data, it appears that these patients should have an enhanced adherence to the recommended preventive measures, suggesting a role in reducing their risk of infection. Furthermore, the immunotherapy may dampen the cytokine storm and inflammation associated with COVID-19. The results of this review seem to confirm that patients with IBD receiving immunomodulators, biologics, or Janus Kinase inhibitors do not have an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection or develop a more severe COVID-19. According to the current evidence, it is advisable to maintain immunotherapy, apart from corticosteroids, in patients with IBD in order to avoid relapse. This review reports only on the cases of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab sample. This is a limitation and a more accurate epidemiological picture of the infection will be obtained only via the expanded use of antibody tests.","Scribano, Maria Lia",Dig. dis. sci,45,29

It is influenced by multiple factors such as surgical, patient-related, and orthodontic aspects. While recent reviews mainly focus on short-term dental changes (0.5-2 years), longer follow-up dental stability remains hardly reviewed. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term stability of dental and dentolabial changes following combined orthodontic and orthognathic surgical treatment with a minimum follow-up period of 5 years. SEARCH METHODS: A systematic search was conducted up to December 2019 using Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and case series with a minimum of 10 patients, which reported long-term dental stability following combined orthodontic and orthognathic treatment, were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Long-term changes were assessed for overjet, overbite, maxillary, and mandibular incisors' position and relationship of lip position to maxillary and mandibular incisors. Risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook. RESULTS: Following the screening of 3178 articles, 11 studies were included (2 RCT, 9 retrospective) with a postoperative follow-up period ranging from 5 to 15 years. A decrease in overjet was observed for patients with skeletal class III malocclusion, whereas overjet increased in class II patients at long-term follow-up. Overbite increased in class II patients, whereas class III showed variable results. The lower incisor position was more stable vertically than horizontally; the latter showing more outcome variability. Dentolabial changes corresponded to the normal ageing process and results were not clinically significant after long-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests variability of dental and dentolabial stability in both skeletal class II and III patients. Further prospective studies are required to develop guidelines for long-term follow-up assessment using computer tomography or cone-beam computed tomography imaging, before final conclusions can be drawn.

The availability of both monomer and dimer crystal bound with a common ligand, '13b' (&#945;-ketoamide inhibitor), opened up opportunities to understand the Mpro mechanism of action. A comparative analysis of both forms of Mpro was carried out to elucidate the binding site architectural differences in the presence and absence of '13b'. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the presence of '13b' enhances the stability of Mpro than the unbound APO form. The N- and C- terminals of both the protomers stabilize each other, and making it's interface essential for the active form of Mpro. In comparison to monomer, the relatively high affinity of '13b' is gained in dimer pocket due to the high stability of the pocket by the interaction of S1 residue of chain B with residues F140, E166 and H172 of chain A, which is absent in monomer. The comprehensive essential dynamics, protein structure network analysis and thermodynamic profiling highlight the hot-spots, pivotal in molecular recognition process at protein-ligand and protein-protein interaction levels, cross-validated through computational alanine scanning study. A comparative description of '13b' binding mechanism in both forms illustrates valuable insights into the inhibition mechanism and the selection of critical residues suitable for the structure-based approaches for the identification of more potent Mpro inhibitors.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

However, such generation systems often suffer from problems of hallucinated facts, and are not inherently designed to incorporate useful external information. Grounded generation models appear to offer remedies, but their training typically relies on rarely-available parallel data where corresponding information-relevant documents are provided for context. We propose a framework that alleviates this data constraint by jointly training a grounded generator and document retriever on the language model signal. The model learns to reward retrieval of the documents with the highest utility in generation, and attentively combines them using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) ensemble to generate follow-on text. We demonstrate that both generator and retriever can take advantage of this joint training and work synergistically to produce more informative and relevant text in both prose and dialogue generation.","Zhang, Yizhe; Sun, Siqi; Gao, Xiang; Fang, Yuwei; Brockett, Chris; Galley, Michel; Gao, Jianfeng; Dolan, Bill",,45,1

Yet, they mostly focus on capturing information from the nodes considering their connectivity, and not much work has been done in representing the edges, which are essential components of a graph. However, for tasks such as graph reconstruction and generation, as well as graph classification tasks for which the edges are important for discrimination, accurately representing edges of a given graph is crucial to the success of the graph representation learning. To this end, we propose a novel edge representation learning framework based on Dual Hypergraph Transformation (DHT), which transforms the edges of a graph into the nodes of a hypergraph. This dual hypergraph construction allows us to apply message passing techniques for node representations to edges. After obtaining edge representations from the hypergraphs, we then cluster or drop edges to obtain holistic graph-level edge representations. We validate our edge representation learning method with hypergraphs on diverse graph datasets for graph representation and generation performance, on which our method largely outperforms existing graph representation learning methods. Moreover, our edge representation learning and pooling method also largely outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification, not only because of its accurate edge representation learning, but also due to its lossless compression of the nodes and removal of irrelevant edges for effective message passing.","Jo, Jaehyeong; Baek, Jinheon; Lee, Seul; Kim, Dongki; Kang, Minki; Hwang, Sung Ju",,45,16

METHODS: NtAbs were titrated as dose-inhibiting 50% virus replication (ID50) by live virus microneutralization. We evaluated 41 health care workers recovering from mild or asymptomatic infection at first vaccination dose (T1_inf) and 21 days later (T2_inf). Sixteen uninfected health care workers were evaluated 20 days after first dose (T2_uninf) and 20 days after second vaccine dose (T3_uninf). RESULTS: At T2_inf, but not at T1_inf, there was a significant correlation between days from diagnosis (median 313, interquartile range 285-322) and NtAb levels (P = 0.011). NtAb titres increased at T2_inf with respect to T1_inf (1544 (732-2232) vs 26 (10-88), P < 0.001). Similarly, there was a significant increase in NtAb titres at T3_uninf compared with T2_uninf (183 (111-301) vs 5 (5-15), P < 0001). However, NtAb levels at T2_inf were significantly higher than those at T2_uninf and T3_uninf (P < 0.0001 for both analyses). CONCLUSIONS: A single vaccination in people with mild or asymptomatic previous infection further boosts SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity to levels higher than those obtained by complete two-vaccination in uninfected subjects.","Vicenti, Ilaria; Gatti, Francesca; Scaggiante, Renzo; Boccuto, Adele; Zago, Daniela; Basso, Monica; Dragoni, Filippo; Zazzi, Maurizio; Parisi, Saverio Giuseppe",Int J Infect Dis,45,1

Consequently, there is a need for effective treatment options to improve cognitive functioning in these patients. In a healthy aging population, multidomain web-based lifestyle interventions have been found to be effective in preventing cognitive decline and improving cognitive functioning. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of the web-based lifestyle intervention Mijn Fitte Brein (My Fit Brain [MFB]) on cognitive functioning in patients with cancer returning to work. METHODS: The study consists of a feasibility study (N=10), followed by a randomized controlled trial (RCT; N=220). Patients will be recruited by their occupational physicians after their return to work following cancer treatment. Mijn Fitte Brein is organized into 4-week cycles in which patients set a lifestyle goal using the Goal Attainment Scale, receive weekly tips and support, and finally evaluate whether they succeeded in achieving this goal. Lifestyle goals are based on 6 domains: physical exercise, diet, sleep, stress, alcohol use, and smoking. In the feasibility study, data on user experience (structured interview) and usability, assessed with the Post-Study System Usability Scale, will be collected and used to optimize Mijn Fitte Brein. In the RCT, patients will be randomized 1:1 between an intervention group and a control group. Patients will be assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The primary outcome measure is subjective cognitive functioning, assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog). Secondary outcome measures are lifestyle, objective cognitive functioning, and work and psychosocial factors. RESULTS: Recruitment for the feasibility study has started in February 2020. As of July 2020, however, no patients have been enrolled (due to COVID-19 restrictions). The findings of the feasibility study will be used to optimize the Mijn Fitte Brein intervention. Enrollment for the RCT will continue when possible. The feasibility study will take 6 months (including making adjustments to the intervention), and the RCT will take 2 years. The final results are expected in 2024. The results of the feasibility study and the RCT will be published in peer-reviewed journals. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first time the feasibility and efficacy of a multidomain web-based lifestyle intervention will be studied in patients with cancer. If Mijn Fitte Brein is found to be effective in decreasing cognitive complaints in these patients returning to work, it will be a promising treatment option because of being both affordable and accessible.

Although these were not randomized controlled trials, they do suggest a potential avenue for further investigation. Technical details in these reports however were limited. In this work we review the literature and identify details including nominal kilovoltage ranges, filtration, and focus-skin distances (FSDs). Using a freely available and benchmarked code, we generated spectra and used these as sources for Monte Carlo simulations using the EGSnrc software package. The approximate sources were projected through a radiologically anthropomorphic phantom to provide detailed dose distributions within a targeted lung volume (approximate right middle lobe). After accounting for the reported exposure levels, mean lung doses fell in a relatively narrow range: 30-80 cGy. Variation in patient dimensions and other details are expected to result in an uncertainty on the order of ± 20%. This result is consistent with the dose range expected to induce anti-inflammatory effects.","Kirkby, Charles; Mackenzie, Marc",Phys Med Biol,45,17

In this work, acetylated lignin was used to encapsulate five different porphyrins, aiming to preserve their photophysical properties, and for further use as antibacterial treatment. The obtained nanoparticles were physically characterized, through dynamic light scattering size measurement, polydispersity index and zeta potential values. Additionally, the photophysical properties of the nanoparticles, namely UV-vis absorption, fluorescence emission, singlet oxygen production and photobleaching, were compared with those of the free porphyrins. It was found that all the porphyrins were susceptible to encapsulation, with an observed decrease in their fluorescence quantum yield and singlet oxygen production. These nanoparticles were able to exert an effective photodynamic bactericide effect (blue-LED light, 450–460 nm, 15 J/cm2) on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Furthermore, it was achieved a photodynamic bactericidal activity on an encapsulated lipophillic porphyrin, where the free porphyrin failed to diminish the bacterial survival. In this work it was demonstrated that acetylated lignin encapsulation works as a universal, cheap and green material for the delivery of porphyrins, while preserving their photophysical properties.","Maldonado-Carmona, Nidia Tan-Sothea Ouk Villandier Nicolas Claude Alain Calliste Calvete Mário J.

Indeed, these changes in tryptophan metabolism correlated with interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. Widespread dysregulation of nitrogen metabolism was also seen in infected patients, with altered levels of most amino acids, along with increased markers of oxidant stress (e.g., methionine sulfoxide, cystine), proteolysis, and renal dysfunction (e.g., creatine, creatinine, polyamines). Increased circulating levels of glucose and free fatty acids were also observed, consistent with altered carbon homeostasis. Interestingly, metabolite levels in these pathways correlated with clinical laboratory markers of inflammation (i.e., IL-6 and C-reactive protein) and renal function (i.e., blood urea nitrogen).CONCLUSIONIn conclusion, this initial observational study identified amino acid and fatty acid metabolism as correlates of COVID-19, providing mechanistic insights, potential markers of clinical severity, and potential therapeutic targets.FUNDINGBoettcher Foundation Webb-Waring Biomedical Research Award; National Institute of General and Medical Sciences, NIH; and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH.","Thomas, Tiffany; Stefanoni, Davide; Reisz, Julie A; Nemkov, Travis; Bertolone, Lorenzo; Francis, Richard O; Hudson, Krystalyn E; Zimring, James C; Hansen, Kirk C; Hod, Eldad A; Spitalnik, Steven L; D039,; Alessandro, Angelo",JCI insight,45,1

New long-term analyses of cognition in people with HIV-1 identified that cognitive decline over time is associated with multimorbidity, particularly diabetes, chronic lung disease, and vascular disease risk conditions. These conditions are associated with aging, and the question of whether people with HIV are at risk for premature aging was addressed by several reports. New findings from large analyses of resting state networks also provided valuable information on the structural and functional networks that are affected by HIV-1 infection and cognitive impairment. Several reports addressed changes after initiating or switching antiretroviral therapy (ART). Findings that will improve understanding of the biologic mechanisms of brain injury in people with HIV were also presented and included evidence that host (eg, myeloid activation, inflammation, and endothelial activation) and viral (eg, transcriptional activity and compartmentalization) factors adversely affect brain health. Other research focused on adjunctive therapies to treat HIV-1 and its complications in the central nervous system. This summary will review these and other findings in greater detail and identify key gaps and opportunities for researchers and clinicians.","Ances, B. M.; Anderson, A. M.; Letendre, S.

Zoonoses are the commonest source of emerging human infections and inter-species transmission is facilitated by anthropogenic factors such as encroachment and destruction of wilderness areas, wildlife trafficking and climate change. South Africa was selected for a 'One Health' study to identify research priorities for control of zoonoses due to its complex disease burden and an overstretched health system. METHODS: A multidisciplinary group of 18 experts identified priority zoonotic diseases, knowledge gaps and proposed research priorities for the next 5 y. Each priority was scored using predefined criteria by another group of five experts and then weighted by a reference group (n=28) and the 18 experts. RESULTS: Seventeen diseases were mentioned with the top five being rabies (14/18), TB (13/18), brucellosis (11/18), Rift Valley fever (9/11) and cysticercosis (6/18). In total, 97 specific research priorities were listed, with the majority on basic epidemiological research (n=57), such as measuring the burden of various zoonoses (n=24), followed by 20 on development of new interventions. The highest research priority score was for improving existing interventions (0.77/1.0), followed by health policy and systems research (0.72/1.0). CONCLUSION: Future zoonotic research should improve understanding of zoonotic burden and risk factors and new interventions in public health. People with limited rural services, immunocompromised, in informal settlements and high-risk occupations, should be the highest research priority.","Simpson, Greg; Quesada, Fabiola; Chatterjee, Pranab; Kakkar, Manish; Chersich, Matthew F; Thys, Séverine",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,45,20

In Spain, the heterogeneous distribution of the virus infection and the different health strategies have conditioned the morbidity and fatality rate. The aim of this study was to analyse the lethality of the infection by sex and age range in the Autonomous Communities (AC) of Spain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To perform the analysis, data were extracted from the Ministry of Health, Regional and Public Health Departments of the different AC. The infected population was estimated from the results of the ENE-COVID19 and the population registered on 1 January 2020 (INE) for the validity of the IgG antibody test with 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The case fatality rate (TL) (deaths/1000 estimated infected) by sex and age (<20years, 20-64 and &#8805;65years) was calculated for each AC. The standardized case fatality ratio (REL) was calculated by the exact method (EPIDAT). RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain was 6% (range, 1.4% [Ceuta] -14.1% [Community of Madrid]). The TL in Spain was 9,6/1000, ranged per AC from 1/1000 in Melilla to 26.6/1000 in La Rioja, with no correlation between case fatality and prevalence of infection. The TL was higher in men (10.2/1000, ratio 1.17 with respect to women), except in Cataluña (ratio 0.92), and especially high in those over 64years of age in La Rioja (143.5/1000), Asturias (69.2/1000) and Basque Country (46.6/1000). Overall excess REL was found to be over 30% in La Rioja (2.91; 95%CI: 2.36-3.57), Asturias (1.51; 95%CI: 1.27-1.80), Basque Country (1.42; 95%CI: 1.31-1.54) and Extremadura (1.37; 95%CI: 1.20-1.57) and in those over 64 years in Madrid and the Canary Islands. CONCLUSIONS: SARs-CoV-2 virus infection has been very unevenly distributed in the different ACs, with notably differences in TL between ACs, particularly high in La Rioja, Asturias and the Basque Country. Is important to study the excess in TL the population over 64years of age in the ACs of Madrid and the Canary Islands.","Martín-Sánchez, V; Barquilla-García, A; Vitelli-Storelli, F; Segura-Fragoso, A; Ruiz-García, A; Serrano-Cumplido, A; Olmo-Quintana, V; Calderón-Montero, A",Semergen,45,24

METHODS: Patients in this study included newly diagnosed outpatients and online patients who did not undergo an outpatient diagnosis. Patients performed regular ear self-examinations, took pictures at home using their smartphone endoscopes, and submitted images to a WeChat community. Otolaryngologist gave timely online feedback. All of the following data were recorded: patients age and gender, disease duration, outpatient diagnosis, side, telemedicine duration, number of telemedicine visits, outcomes, satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 74 patients were included in the study, including 39 males and 35 females, with an average age of 31.1 ± 13.7 years (range 4-55 years). Of these patients, 68 were outpatients, and 6 directly participated in telemedicine online. The patient's disease duration ranged from 1 day to 15 days, with an average of 4.0 ± 3.0 days. The mean duration was 8.1 days (range: 3-21 days) for telemedicine. The mean number of visits was 2.7 times (range: 2-6 times) for telemedicine. 68 (91.9%) of the 74 patients were cured, 6 (8.1%) were improved, and 0 (0%) were ineffective. Almost all patients were pleased with the telemedicine service, 71.9 0% were very satisfied (n = 62), 28.10% were very satisfied (n = 11), and 0% were dissatisfied (n = 0). CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone otoscopes telemedicine can decrease outpatient follow-up, reduce the risk of cross-infection, increase telemedicine accuracy, and improve patient satisfaction.

YTHDF1 is associated with the development of several kinds of cancers, yet whether common variants of the YTHDF1 gene influence Wilms tumor risk is unknown. We present, here, a hospital-based case-control study specifically designed to investigate the role of YTHDF1 genetic variants on Wilms tumor. METHODS: We successfully genotyped samples of 408 Wilms tumor cases and 1198 controls which were collected from five hospitals across China. The unconditional logistic regression was adopted to analyze the contributions of YTHDF1 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the risk of Wilms tumor. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were generated to evaluate the conferring risk of YTHDF1 gene SNPs (rs6011668 C>T, rs6090311 A>G). RESULTS: Neither of the two SNPs could contribute to the risk of Wilms tumor. A negative association was also detected in the combined effects of protective genotypes on Wilms tumor risk. The stratification analysis revealed that compared with those with CC genotype, rs6011668 CT/TT genotype was associated with increased Wilms tumor risk in those &#8804;18 months (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.02-2.30, p = 0.038), and with decreased Wilms tumor risk in those >18 months (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.50-0.97, p = 0.034).

Several prior studies have calculated excess deaths in the United States but were limited to the national or state level, precluding an examination of area-level variation in excess mortality and excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19. In this study, we take advantage of county-level variation in COVID-19 mortality to estimate excess deaths associated with the pandemic and examine how the extent of excess mortality not assigned to COVID-19 varies across subsets of counties defined by sociodemographic and health characteristics. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this ecological, cross-sectional study, we made use of provisional National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data on direct COVID-19 and all-cause mortality occurring in US counties from January 1 to December 31, 2020 and reported before March 12, 2021. We used data with a 10-week time lag between the final day that deaths occurred and the last day that deaths could be reported to improve the completeness of data. Our sample included 2,096 counties with 20 or more COVID-19 deaths. The total number of residents living in these counties was 319.1 million. On average, the counties were 18.7% Hispanic, 12.7% non-Hispanic Black, and 59.6% non-Hispanic White. A total of 15.9% of the population was older than 65 years. We first modeled the relationship between 2020 all-cause mortality and COVID-19 mortality across all counties and then produced fully stratified models to explore differences in this relationship among strata of sociodemographic and health factors. Overall, we found that for every 100 deaths assigned to COVID-19, 120 all-cause deaths occurred (95% CI, 116 to 124), implying that 17% (95% CI, 14% to 19%) of excess deaths were ascribed to causes of death other than COVID-19 itself. Our stratified models revealed that the percentage of excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 was substantially higher among counties with lower median household incomes and less formal education, counties with poorer health and more diabetes, and counties in the South and West. Counties with more non-Hispanic Black residents, who were already at high risk of COVID-19 death based on direct counts, also reported higher percentages of excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19. Study limitations include the use of provisional data that may be incomplete and the lack of disaggregated data on county-level mortality by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and sociodemographic and health characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that direct COVID-19 death counts in the US in 2020 substantially underestimated total excess mortality attributable to COVID-19. Racial and socioeconomic inequities in COVID-19 mortality also increased when excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 were considered. Our results highlight the importance of considering health equity in the policy response to the pandemic.","Stokes, Andrew C; Lundberg, Dielle J; Elo, Irma T; Hempstead, Katherine; Bor, Jacob; Preston, Samuel H",PLoS Med,45,3

In hospitalized-patients, prompt interruption of the virus-driven inflammatory process by using combination treatments seems theoretically of outmost importance. Our aim was to investigate the hypothesis of multifaceted management of these patients. Methods A treatment algorithm based on ferritin was applied in 311 patients (67.2% males; median age 63-years; moderate disease, n=101; severe, n=210). Patients with ferritin <500ng/ml received anakinra 2-4mg/kg/day ± corticosteroids (Arm A, n=142) while those with &#8805;500ng/ml received anakinra 5-8mg/kg/day with corticosteroids and Î³-globulins (Arm B, n=169). In case of no improvement a single dose of tocilizumab (8mg/kg; maximum 800mg) was administered with the potential of additional second and/or third pulses. Treatment endpoints were the rate of the development of respiratory failure necessitating intubation and the SARS-CoV-2-related mortality. The proposed algorithm was also validated in matched hospitalized-patients treated with standard-of-care during the same period. Results In overall, intubation and mortality rates were 5.8% and 5.1% (0% in moderate; 8.6% and 7.6% in severe). Low baseline pO2/FiO2 and older age were independent risk factors. Comparators had significantly higher intubation (HR=7.4; 95%CI: 4.1-13.4; p<0.001) and death rates (HR=4.5, 95%CI: 2.1-9.4, p<0.001).

The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of statins on COVID-19 severity for people who have been taking statins before COVID-19 infection. The examined research patients include people that had taken three types of statins consisting of Atorvastatin, Simvastatin, and Rosuvastatin. The case study includes 561 patients admitted to the Razi Hospital in Ghaemshahr, Iran, during February and March 2020. The illness severity was encoded based on the respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, systolic pressure, and diastolic pressure in five categories: mild, medium, severe, critical, and death. Since 69.23% of participants were in mild severity condition, the results showed the positive effect of Simvastatin on COVID-19 severity for people that take Simvastatin before being infected by the COVID-19 virus. Also, systolic pressure for this case study is 137.31, which is higher than that of the total patients. Another result of this study is that Simvastatin takers have an average of 95.77 mmHg O2Sat; however, the O2Sat is 92.42, which is medium severity for evaluating the entire case study.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between overdose deaths and carfentanil availability in the United States. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of drug overdose deaths from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and carfentanil exhibit data from drug seizures submitted to drug crime labs and published by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Trends in overdose deaths were compared in states with high carfentanil exhibits with states with low or no carfentanil exhibits. SETTING: United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1 035 923 drug overdose death records in the United States from 1979 through 2019 were studied. MEASUREMENTS: The outcomes studied were number of overdose deaths and mortality rates by state. FINDINGS: Drug overdose deaths have been closely tracked along an exponential curve. The years 2016 and 2017 witnessed a hyper-exponential surge with increases in overdose deaths of 11 228 (+21.4%) and 6605 (+10.4%), respectively. Subsequently in 2018, drug overdose deaths declined by -2870 (-4.1%). This rise and then fall coincided with a surge and then decline in carfentanil drug seizure exhibits during these same years: 0 (2015), 1292 (2016), 5857 (2017) and 804 (2018). The majority of carfentanil exhibits were localized to a few states. The 2018 decline in overdose deaths in the top five states with the greatest spike in carfentanil exhibits in 2017 (Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Michigan) was 2848, which accounted for nearly all of the total US decline. CONCLUSIONS: The 2016-2017 acceleration and then 2018 decline in drug overdose deaths in the United States was associated with the sudden rise and then fall of carfentanil availability. Given the regional variation, carfentanil's decreased availability may have contributed to the reduction in overdose deaths in 2018.","Jalal, Hawre; Burke, Donald S",Addiction,45,16

Although there are many unknowns surrounding COVID-19 vaccine development, vaccine demand will likely outstrip early supply, making prospective planning for vaccine allocation critical for ensuring the ethical distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Here, we propose three central goals for COVID-19 vaccination campaigns: to reduce morbidity and mortality, to minimise additional economic and societal burdens related to the pandemic and to narrow unjust health inequalities. We evaluate five prioritisation approaches, assess their likely impact on advancing the three goals of vaccine allocation and identify open scientific questions that may alter their outcomes. We argue that no single prioritisation approach will advance all three goals. Instead, we propose a multipronged approach that considers the risk of serious COVID-19 illness, instrumental value and the risk of transmission, and is guided by future research on COVID-19-specific clinical and vaccine characteristics.

Though quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) is the method of choice for COVID-19 diagnostics, the resource-intensive and time-consuming nature of the technique impairs its wide applicability in resource-constrained settings and calls for novel strategies to meet the ever-growing demand for more testing. In this context, a pooled sample testing strategy was evaluated in the setting of emerging disease outbreak in 3 central Indian districts to assess if the cost of the test and turn-around time could be reduced without compromising its diagnostic characteristics and thus lead to early containment of the outbreak. From 545 nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples received from the three emerging districts, a total of 109 pools were created with 5 consecutive samples in each pool. The diagnostic performance of qRT-PCR on pooled sample was compared with that of individual samples in a blinded manner. While pooling reduced the cost of diagnosis by 68% and the laboratory processing time by 66%, 5 of the 109 pools showed discordant results when compared with induvial samples. Four pools which tested negative contained 1 positive sample and 1 pool which was positive did not show any positive sample on deconvolution. Presence of a single infected sample with Ct value of 34 or higher, in a pool of 5, was likely to be missed in pooled sample analysis. At the reported point prevalence of 4.8% in this study, the negative predictive value of qRT-PCR on pooled samples was around 96% suggesting that the adoption of this strategy as an effective screening tool for COVID-19 needs to be carefully evaluated.","Singh, Anirudh K; Nema, Ram Kumar; Joshi, Ankur; Shankar, Prem; Nema, Shashwati; Raghuwanshi, Arun; Patankar, Chitra; Mathew, Bijina J; Shrivas, Arti; Pandey, Ritu; Tripathi, Ranu; Biswas, Debasis; Singh, Sarman",PLoS One,45,16

First, the role of ACE2 itself is still a matter of investigation, and no specific drugs are available targeting ACE2. Second, as a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 interaction with ACE2, there is an impairment of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) involved in the functioning of vital organs like the heart, kidney, brain, and lungs. In developing antiviral drugs for COVID-19, ACE2, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and the specific enzymes involved in the viral and cellular gene expression have been the primary targets. SARS-CoV-2 being a new virus with unusually high mortality, there has been a need to get medicines in an emergency, and the drug repurposing has been a primary strategy. Considering extensive mortality and morbidity throughout the world, we have made a maiden attempt to discover the drugs interacting with RAS and identify the lead compounds from herbal plants using molecular docking. Both host ACE2 and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and ORF8 appear to be the primary targets for the treatment of COVID-19. While the drug repurposing of currently approved drugs seems to be one strategy for the treatment of COVID-19, purposing phytochemicals may be another essential strategy for discovering lead compounds. Using in silico molecular docking, we have identified a few phytochemicals that may provide insights into designing herbal and synthetic therapeutics to treat COVID-19.","Goyal, Ramesh K; Majeed, Jaseela; Tonk, Rajiv; Dhobi, Mahaveer; Patel, Bhoomika; Sharma, Kalicharan; Apparsundaram, Subbu",Rev Cardiovasc Med,45,16

Unfortunately, a simplified risk score that could easily be used in primary care or general practice settings has not been developed. The objective of this study is to identify a simplified risk score that could easily be used to quickly triage severe COVID-19 patients. All severe and critical adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 on the West campus of Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from 28 January 2020 to 29 February 2020 were included in this study. Clinical data and laboratory results were obtained. CURB-65 pneumonia score was calculated. Univariate logistic regressions were applied to explore risk factors associated with in-hospital death. We used the receiver operating characteristic curve and multivariate COX-PH model to analyse risk factors for in-hospital death. A total of 74 patients (31 died, 43 survived) were finally included in the study. We observed that compared with survivors, non-survivors were older and illustrated higher respiratory rate, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), but lower SpO2 as well as impaired liver function, especially synthesis function. CURB-65 showed good performance for predicting in-hospital death (area under curve 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-0.91). CURB-65 â©¾ 2 may serve as a cut-off value for prediction of in-hospital death in severe patients with COVID-19 (sensitivity 68%, specificity 81%, F1 score 0.7).

The increasing prevalence of malignancy has become a leading cause of human mortality. However, conflicting findings have been published on the association between malignancy and COVID-19 severity. This study aims to assess the pooled proportion of malignancy amongst 2019-nCov patients and to investigate the association between malignancy and COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Correlative studies were identi?ed by systematically searching electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Sciences and Embase) up to September 2, 2020. All data analyses were carried out using Stata 15.0. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies consisting of 9475 confirmed COVID-19 patients (median age 54.4 years [IQR 49-62], 54.0% men) were included. The overall proportion of malignancy was 2.5% (95% CI 1.6%-3.4%). The proportion of malignancy was higher in patients with severe/critical 2019-nCoV than those in non-severe/non-critical group (3.9% [95% CI 2.0-6.3] vs 1.4% [95% CI 0.8-2.2]). Furthermore, pre-existing malignancy was associated with more than twofold higher risk of severe/critical patients with COVID-19 (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.65-3.06 I2 = 0.0%). CONCLUSION: Malignancy was associated with up to 2.3-fold higher risk of severe/critical COVID-19 and may serve as a clinical predictor for adverse outcomes.","Liu, G E; Cai, Wei; Liu, Huan; Jiang, Hai Hong; Yi Bi, Yong; Wang, Hong",Turkish journal of medical sciences,45,20

This is especially true for subpopulations like young men who have sex with men and young transgender women (YMSM-YTW) who report higher rates of substance use. This study examines changes in prevalence and frequency of marijuana and non-marijuana drug use among YMSM-YTW following the onset of the pandemic. METHOD: Data for this analysis (n = 458 participants, 1356 observations) come from an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of YMSM-YTW. A series of Bayesian multilevel models were used to examine change in prevalence and frequency of use for marijuana and non-marijuana drugs. RESULTS: Results indicated no systematic change in prevalence or frequency of marijuana use. However, a decrease in non-marijuana drug use was observed (OR = 0.60, 95 % CrI: [0.37, 0.94]) following the onset of the pandemic. Furthermore, a small increase in the frequency of non-marijuana drug use was observed (OR = 1.79, 95 % CrI: [1.02, 3.21]) among individuals who used these substances. CONCLUSIONS: These findings concur with a small number of studies identifying a decrease in drug use prevalence but increase in frequency among those who continue to use drugs. Despite the protective effect of lower drug use prevalence, higher frequency of use may lead to additional negative health outcomes of drug use, particularly among groups facing multiple health challenges such as YMSM-YTW.

In an effort to minimize the risk of exposure and optimize patient care, we sought to develop, test, provide training, and implement a standardized algorithm for intubating these high-risk patients at our institution. METHODS: We developed an initial intubation algorithm, incorporating strategic use of equipment and incorporating emerging best practices. By combining simulation-based training sessions and rapid-cycle improvement methodology with physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists, and incorporating their feedback into the development, we were able to optimize the process prior to implementation. Training sessions also enabled the participants to practice the algorithm as a team. Upon completion of each training session, participants were invited to complete a brief online survey about their overall experience. RESULTS: An algorithm and training system vetted by simulation and actual practice were developed. A training video and dissemination package were made available for other emergency departments to adopt. Survey results were overall positive, with 97.92% of participants feeling confident in their role in the intubation process, and many participants citing the usefulness of the multidisciplinary approach to the training. CONCLUSION: A multidisciplinary, team-based approach to the development and training of a standardized intubation algorithm combining simulation and rapid-cycle improvement methodology is a useful, effective process to respond to rapidly evolving clinical information and experiences during a global pandemic.","Trembley, Lauren L; Tobias, Adam Z; Schillo, Gwendolyn; von Foerster, Nicholas; Singer, Jordan; Pavelka, Samantha L; Phrampus, Paul",West J Emerg Med,45,10

The analysis exploits a natural experiment to disentangle the effects of the virus and the laws aiming to contain it: Denmark and Sweden were similarly exposed to the pandemic but only Denmark imposed significant restrictions on social and economic activities. We estimate that aggregate spending dropped by around 25% (95% CI: 24 to 26%) in Sweden and, as a result of the shutdown, by 4 additional percentage points (95% CI: 3 to 5 percentage points [p.p.]) in Denmark. This suggests that most of the economic contraction is caused by the virus itself and occurs regardless of social distancing laws. The age gradient in the estimates suggests that social distancing reinforces the virus-induced drop in spending for low-health-risk individuals but attenuates it for high-risk individuals by lowering the overall prevalence of the virus in the society.","Sheridan, Adam; Andersen, Asger Lau; Hansen, Emil Toft; Johannesen, Niels",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,45,12

Unlike proteins, glycans do not typically adopt specific secondary structures and remain very mobile, influencing protein dynamics and interactions with other molecules. Glycan conformational freedom impairs complete structural elucidation of glycoproteins. Computer simulations may be used to model glycan structure and dynamics. However, such simulations typically require thousands of computing hours on specialized supercomputers, thus limiting routine use. Here, we describe a reductionist method that can be implemented on personal computers to graft ensembles of realistic glycan conformers onto static protein structures in a matter of minutes. Using this open-source pipeline, we reconstructed the full glycan cover of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein) and a human GABAA receptor. Focusing on S-protein, we show that GlycoSHIELD recapitulates key features of extended simulations of the glycosylated protein, including epitope masking, and provides new mechanistic insights on N-glycan impact on protein structural dynamics.","Gecht, Michael; Bülow, Sören von; Penet, Camille; Hummer, Gerhard; Hanus, Cyril; Sikora, Mateusz",,45,20

Due to geographical challenges and limited resources, clinicians developed novel strategies for managing patients. The use of a dual oxygen concentrator system for mechanical ventilation is one of the innovations developed by retrieval team members from the Emergency Department (ED) of the Sabah Women and Children's Hospital. Due to conditions requiring isolation of patients suspected of or positive for COVID-19, high-risk patients were treated in an ED extension area that lacked central wall oxygen. Direct access to oxygen tanks became the only viable option, but ensuring a continuous supply was laborious. The novel setup described within this paper has been used on intubated patients in the ED extension area with moderate to high ventilator settings successfully. This simple setup, designed to meet the limited resources within a pandemic environment, needed only a turbine-driven ventilator, two oxygen concentrators, a 3-way connector, and three oxygen tubing. The application of this setup could potentially save more critically ill patients who are being managed in resource-limited conditions such as in smaller district hospitals or out in the field.","Cheah, Phee Kheng; Steven, Evelyn Marie; Ng, Khai Keam; Hashim, Muammar Iqbal; Abdul Kadir, Mohamed Hakimi; Roder, Nicholas Paul",Int J Emerg Med,45,16

Therefore, a descriptive study of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2)/COVID-19 infection in transplant recipients and patients on the waiting list was conducted. The data sources were the information systems of the Instituto Nacional de Salud of Colombia: National Donation and Transplant Information System, the National Public Health Surveillance System, and the National COVID-19 Data Repository. Characteristics of the patients who tested positive were analyzed, and the mortality rate was determined. An Real Time-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 was performed in 7% of the transplant recipients included in this study, and 14.8% of those recipients tested positive. Among patients on the waiting list, 15.2% were tested, and 16.7% showed positive results. Overall, 1% (84/8108) of the transplant recipients and 2.5% (74/2926) of patients on the waiting list were infected with SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19.

In order to contain infection of this highly contagious disease, most of the world population is constrained to live in a complete or partial lockdown for months together with a minimal human-to-human interaction having far reaching consequences on countries' economy and mental well-being of their citizens. Hence, there is a need for a good predictive model for the health advisory bodies and decision makers for taking calculated proactive measures to contain the pandemic and maintain a healthy economy. This paper extends the mathematical theory of the classical Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemic model and proposes a Generalized SIR (GSIR) model that is an integrative model encompassing multiple waves of daily reported cases. Existing growth function models of epidemic have been shown as the special cases of the GSIR model. Dynamic modeling of the parameters reflect the impact of policy decisions, social awareness, and the availability of medication during the pandemic. GSIR framework can be utilized to find a good fit or predictive model for any pandemic. The study is performed on the COVID-19 data for various countries with detailed results for India, Brazil, United States of America (USA), and World. The peak infection, total expected number of COVID-19 cases and thereof deaths, time-varying reproduction number, and various other parameters are estimated from the available data using the proposed methodology.

To enhance the prediction capabilities of the models, properties of the unknown uncertainties in the pandemic disease, which can be utterly random, or function of the system dynamics, or it can be correlated with an unknown function, should be determined. The known structures and amount of the uncertainties can also help the state authorities to improve the policies based on the recognized source of the uncertainties. For instance, the uncertainties correlated with an unknown function imply existence of an undetected factor in the casualties. In this paper, we extend the SpID-N (Suspicious-Infected-Death with non-pharmacological policies) model as in the form of MIMO (Multi-Input-Multi-Output) structure by adding the multi-dimensional unknown uncertainties. The results confirm that the infected and death sub-models mostly have random uncertainties (due undetected casualties) whereas the suspicious sub-model has uncertainties correlated with the internal dynamics (governmental policy of increasing the number of the daily tests) for Turkey. However, since the developed MIMO model parameters are learned from the data (daily reported casualties), it can be easily adapted for other countries. Obtained model with the corresponding uncertainties predicts a distinctive second peak where the number of deaths, infected and suspicious casualties disappear in 240, 290, and more than 300 days, respectively, for Turkey.","Tutsoy, Onder; Balikci, Kemal; Ozdil, Naime Filiz",Digit Signal Process,45,33

METHODS: An obesity model was established by feeding Sprague-Dawley rats (ORs) a high-fat diet (HFD) and treating them with COST for 8 weeks. A model of lipid accumulation in hepatocellular carcinoma cells was established by treating HepG2 cells with free fatty acids and COST for 24 h. RESULTS: COST treatment of ORs reduced weight gain, inhibited adipose tissue hypertrophy and hyperplasia, and reduced the fat-to-weight ratio. COST improved dyslipidaemia, reduced liver weight and organ index, inhibited hepatic lipid accumulation, and prevented liver steatosis, and the high COST dose increased TC and TG excretion in the stool. Treatment of lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells with COST reduced lipid accumulation and TG levels. COST modulated the expression of genes related to fat metabolism and ER stress response pathway-related factors in liver tissue and HepG2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: COST can inhibit weight gain and improve dyslipidaemia and lipid metabolism in ORs. The COST-mediated regulation of hepatic and HepG2 cell lipid metabolism might be related to inhibition of fat synthesis, acceleration of lipid oxidative catabolism and reduction in ER stress.","Deng, Xiaoyi; Ye, Zhijun; Cao, Hua; Bai, Yan; Che, Qishi; Guo, Jiao; Su, Zhengquan",Food Funct,45,32

Methods and Results: During the period from March 7, 2019, to April 18, 2020, due to disruption of molybdenum supply chain, we used low specific activity Tc-99m pertechnetate elute (0.5-2 mCi of 99mTcO4 in 5 mL) for each kit preparation. Two or three intradermal periareolar injections were done for each patient (0.02-0.1 mCi/0.2 mL for each injection). Immediately following injection, dynamic lymphoscintigraphy was done. Surgery was done the same day of injection and the axillary sentinel node was sought using a gamma probe. Overall, 35 patients were included in the study. The specific activity of the Tc-99m elute (in 5 mL) used for kit preparation was 2 mCi/10 mg in four, 1.5 mCi/10 mg in eight, 1.25 mCi/10 mg in eight, 1 mCi/10 mg in three, 0.75 mCi/10 mg in five, and 0.5 mCi/10 mg of 99mTc-Phytate in seven patients. For the first four groups of patients, we used two 0.2 mL injections, while in the latter two groups, three 0.2 mL injections were used. At least one sentinel node was detected in all patients but three in whom axilla was involved. Conclusion: Sentinel node biopsy can be achieved with low specific activity of Tc-99m elute at the time of Mo99-Tc-99m generator shortage. If special personal protection is used, sentinel node mapping can be done in nuclear medicine departments with excellent results despite the COVID-19 pandemic and disruption of generator shipment.","Sadri, Kayvan; Dabbagh, Vahid Reza; Forghani, Mohammad Naser; Asadi, Mahdi; Sadeghi, Ramin",Lymphat. res. biol,45,14

AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the COVID-19 outbreak on hospital admissions and outcomes in ACS patients in a single high-volume centre in southeastern Europe. METHODS: This retrospective observational study aimed to investigate the number of hospital admissions for ACS, clinical findings at admission, length of hospitalisation, major complications and in-hospital mortality during the COVID-19 outbreak and to compare the data with the same parameters during an equivalent time frame in 2019. For the ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) subgroup of patients, changes in ischaemic times were analysed as well. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction of 44.3% in the number of patients admitted for ACS during the COVID-19 outbreak when compared with the same period in 2019 (151 vs 271; 95% confidence interval 38.4-50.2, pâ¯<â¯0.01) with a higher mortality rate (13.2% vs 7.2%, pâ¯= 0.03). In 2020, patients with non-ST-elevated myocardial infarction presented more often with acute heart failure (3.3% vs 0.7%, pâ¯= 0.04).

APPROACH AND RESULTS: We conducted a multicenter study in the US of 112 adult LT recipients with COVID-19. The median age was 61 years (IQR 20), 54.5% (n=61) were male, and 39.3% (n=44) Hispanic. The mortality rate was 22.3% (n=25); 72.3% (n=81) were hospitalized and 26.8% (n=30) admitted to the ICU. Analysis of peak values of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) during COVID-19 showed moderate liver injury (ALT 2-5x ULN) in 22.2% (n= 18) and severe liver injury (ALT > 5x ULN) in 12.3% (n= 10). Compared to age and gender matched non-transplant patients with CLD and COVID-19 (n=375), the incidence of acute liver injury was lower in LT recipients (47.5% vs. 34.6%; p=0.037). Variables associated with liver injury in LT recipients were younger age (p= 0.009, odds ratio (OR) 2.06 [1.20-3.54]), Hispanic ethnicity (p= 0.011; OR 6.01 [1.51-23.9]), metabolic syndrome (p= 0.016; OR 5.87 [1.38-24.99]), vasopressor use (p= 0.018; OR 7.34 [1.39-38.52]) and antibiotic use (p= 0.046; OR 6.93 [1.04-46.26]).

More specifically, a compartmental epidemic model has been considered, in which vaccination, social distance measures, and testing of susceptible individuals have been included. Since the application of these mitigation measures entails a degree of uncertainty, the effects of the uncertainty about the application of social distance actions and testing of susceptible individuals on the disease transmission have been quantified, under the assumption of a mass vaccination program deployment. A spectral approach has been employed, which allows the uncertainty propagation through the epidemic model to be represented by means of the polynomial chaos expansion of the output random variables. In particular, a statistical moment-based polynomial chaos expansion has been implemented, which provides a surrogate model for the compartments of the epidemic model, and allows the statistics, the probability distributions of the interesting output variables of the model at a given time instant to be estimated and the sensitivity analysis to be conducted. The purpose of the sensitivity analysis is to understand which uncertain parameters have most influence on a given output random variable of the model at a given time instant. Several numerical experiments have been conducted whose results show that the proposed spectral approach to uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of epidemic models provides a useful tool to control and mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, when it comes to healthcare resource planning.","Olivares, Alberto; Staffetti, Ernesto",Chaos Solitons Fractals,45,20

An effective response to this pandemic requires health care workers (HCWs) to be present at work, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where they are already in critically low supply. To inform whether and to what degree policymakers in Bangladesh, and LMICs more broadly, should expect a drop in HCW attendance as COVID-19 continues to spread, this study aims to determine how HCW attendance has changed during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. Methods: This study analyzed daily fingerprint-verified attendance data from all 527 public-sector secondary and tertiary care facilities in Bangladesh to describe HCW attendance from January 26, 2019 to March 22, 2020, by cadre, hospital type, and geographic division. We then regressed HCW attendance onto fixed effects for day-of-week, month, and hospital, as well as indicators for each of three pandemic periods: a China-focused period (January 11, 2020 (first confirmed COVID-19 death in China) until January 29, 2020), international-spread period (January 30, 2020 (World Health Organization's declaration of a global emergency) until March 6, 2020), and local-spread period (March 7, 2020 (first confirmed COVID-19 case in Bangladesh) until the end of the study period). Findings: On average between January 26, 2019 and March 22, 2020, 34.1% of doctors, 64.6% of nurses, and 70.6% of other health care staff were present for their scheduled shift. HCWs' attendance rate increased with time in 2019 among all cadres. Nurses' attendance level dropped by 2.5% points (95% confidence interval (CI) = -3.2% to -1.8%) and 3.5% points (95% CI = -4.5% to -2.5%) during the international-spread and the local-spread periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, relative to the China-focused period. Similarly, the attendance level of other health care staff declined by 0.3% points (95% CI = -0.8% to 0.2%) and 2.3% points (95% CI = -3.0% to -1.6%) during the international-spread and local-spread periods, respectively. Among doctors, however, the international-spread and local-spread periods were associated with a statistically significant increase in attendance by 3.7% points (95% CI = 2.5% to 4.8%) and 4.9% points (95% CI = 3.5% to 6.4%), respectively. The reduction in attendance levels across all HCWs during the local-spread period was much greater at large hospitals, where the majority of COVID-19 testing and treatment took place, than that at small hospitals. Conclusions: After a year of significant improvements, HCWs' attendance levels among nurses and other health care staff (who form the majority of Bangladesh's health care workforce) have declined during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding may portend an even greater decrease in attendance if COVID-19 continues to spread in Bangladesh. Policymakers in Bangladesh and similar LMICs should undertake major efforts to achieve high attendance levels among HCWs, particularly nurses, such as by providing sufficient personal protective equipment as well as monetary and non-monetary incentives.","Do, Duy; Sarker, Malabika; Chen, Simiao; Lenjani, Ali; Tikka, Pauli; Bärnighausen, Till; Geldsetzer, Pascal",J Glob Health,45,1

However, V-V ECMO is a new technology compared to veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and cardiopulmonary bypass, and there are few reports of basic research. Although continuing research is desired, clinical research that standardizes conditions such as patients' background characteristics is difficult. The purpose of this study was to establish a simple and stably maintainable miniature V-V ECMO model to study the mechanisms of the biological reactions in circulation during V-V ECMO. The V-V ECMO system consisted of an original miniature membrane oxygenator, polyvinyl chloride tubing line, and roller pump. The priming volume of this system was only 8 mL. Polyethylene tubing was used to cannulate the right femoral vein as the venous return cannula for the V-V ECMO system. A 16-G cannula was passed through the right internal jugular vein and advanced into the right atrium as the conduit for venous uptake. The animals were divided into 2 groups: SHAM group and V-V ECMO group. V-V ECMO was initiated and maintained at 50-60 mL/kg/min, and oxygen was added into the oxygenator during V-V ECMO at a concentration of 100% (pump flow:oxygen = 1:10). Blood pressure was measured continuously, and blood cells were measured by blood collection. During V-V ECMO, the blood pressure and hemodilution rate were maintained around 80 mm Hg and 20%, respectively. Hb was kept at >10 g/dL, and V-V ECMO could be maintained without blood transfusion. It was possible to confirm oxygenation of and carbon dioxide removal from the blood. Likewise, the pH was adequately maintained. There were no problems with this miniature V-V ECMO system, and extracorporeal circulation progressed safely. In this study, a novel miniature V-V ECMO model was established in the rat. A miniature V-V ECMO model appears to be very useful for studying the mechanisms of the biological reactions during V-V ECMO and to perform basic studies of circulation assist devices.","Fujii, Yutaka; Sumikura, Hirohito; Nagahama, Daisuke",Artif. organs,45,5

METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data from COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalized from March 11, 2020 to September 4, 2020. The patients were randomly matched in a 1:1 ratio by age, sex, hospital of admission, smoking history, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease with a cohort of patients without COVID-19. The primary endpoint was the incidence of DVT/PE and the odds of developing DVT/PE using a conditional logistic regression model. The secondary endpoint was the hospitalization outcomes for COVID-19 patients with and without DVT/PE, including mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU stay, and length of hospitalization (LOH). Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify the variables associated with mortality, ICU admission, discharge disposition, ICU duration, and LOH. RESULTS: A total of 13,310 patients had tested positive for COVID-19, 915 of whom (6.9%) had been hospitalized across our multisite health care system. The mean age of the hospitalized patients was 60.8 ± 17.0 years, and 396 (43.3%) were women. Of the 915 patients, 82 (9.0%) had had a diagnosis of DVT/PE confirmed by ultrasound examination of the extremities and/or computed tomography angiography of the chest. The odds of presenting with DVT/PE in the setting of COVID-19 infection was greater than that without COVID-19 infection (0.6% [5 of 915] vs 9.0% [82 of 915]; odds ratio [OR], 18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.0-51.2; P < .001). The vascular risk factors were not different between the COVID-19 patients with and without DVT/PE. Mortality (P = .02), the need for ICU stay (P < .001), duration of ICU stay (P < .001), and LOH (P < .001) were greater in the DVT/PE cohort than in the cohort without DVT/PE. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, the hemoglobin (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.46-0.95; P = .04) and D-dimer (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.33-1.56; P = .03) levels were associated with higher mortality. Higher activated partial thromboplastin times (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.00-1.12; P = .03) and higher interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P = .05) were associated with a greater risk of ICU admission. IL-6 (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; P = .05) was associated with a greater risk of rehabilitation placement after discharge. On multivariable gamma regression analysis, hemoglobin (coefficient, -3.0; 95% CI, 0.03-0.08; P = .005) was associated with a prolonged ICU stay, and the activated partial thromboplastin time (coefficient, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.003-0.006; P = .05), international normalized ratio (coefficient, -3.2; 95% CI, 0.06-0.19; P = .002) and IL-6 (coefficient, 2.4; 95% CI, 0.0011-0.0027; P = .02) were associated with a prolonged LOH. CONCLUSIONS: A significantly greater incidence of DVT/PE occurred in hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients compared with a non-COVID-19 cohort matched for cardiovascular risk factors. Patients affected by DVT/PE were more likely to experience greater mortality, to require ICU admission, and experience prolonged ICU stays and LOH compared with COVID-19-positive patients without DVT/PE. Advancements in DVT/PE prevention are needed for patients hospitalized for COVID-19 infection.","Erben, Young; Franco-Mesa, Camila; Gloviczki, Peter; Stone, William; Quinones-Hinojoas, Alfredo; Meltzer, Andrew J; Lin, Michelle; Greenway, Melanie R F; Hamid, Osman; Devcic, Zlatko; Toskich, Beau; Ritchie, Charles; Lamb, Christopher J; De Martino, Randall R; Siegel, Jason; Farres, Houssan; Hakaim, Albert G; Sanghavi, Devang K; Li, Yupeng; Rivera, Candido; Moreno-Franco, Pablo; O039,; Keefe, Nancy L; Gopal, Neethu; Marquez, Christopher P; Huang, Josephine F; Kalra, Manju; Shields, Raymond; Prudencio, Mercedes; Gendron, Tania; McBane, Robert; Park, Myung; Hoyne, Jonathan B; Petrucelli, Leonard; Horo, John C; Meschia, James F",J.

Health care institutions rapidly transitioned to telehealth to provide care to patients. Prior to the pandemic, telehealth services extended mostly to patients with established diagnoses. Driven by a necessity to provide care to all patients during the pandemic, neurologists started evaluating new patients also via telehealth. OBJECTIVE: To explore opportunities, challenges, and feasibility of telehealth for new patients with neuromuscular disorders. METHODS: New patient visits performed in our neuromuscular clinic were analyzed from March 18, 2020 - July 31, 2020. Data collected included visit volume, demographics, geographic distance of patient's residence from our institution, and no-show and cancellation rates. RESULTS: Total number of patients seen was 1,471; 472 (32%) were new patients. No-show and cancellation rates for telehealth visits were lower than historical in-person visits. There was a wide range of ages (35-74 years) with representation of new patients from a large geographical territory. CONCLUSION: This study advances our understanding regarding the adoption and implementation of telehealth for new patients. Our clinic was able to provide timely access and care to a significant number of patients who could not travel to our institution during COVID-19.","Khan, Shaida; Kramer, Alan; McIver, Johnathan; Cady, Leah; Trivedi, Jaya R",Work,45,10

We propose a detailed model of the topology of the contact network under various external control regimes and demonstrate that this is sufficient to capture the salient dynamical characteristics and to inform decisions. Contact between individuals in the community is characterised by a contact graph, the structure of that contact graph is selected to mimic community control measures. Our model of city-level transmission of an infectious agent (SEIR model) characterises spread via a (a) scale-free contact network (no control); (b) a random graph (elimination of mass gatherings); and (c) small world lattice (partial to full lockdown - 'social' distancing). This model exhibits good qualitative agreement between simulation and data from the 2020 pandemic spread of a novel coronavirus. Estimates of the relevant rate parameters of the SEIR model are obtained and we demonstrate the robustness of our model predictions under uncertainty of those estimates. The social context and utility of this work is identified, contributing to a highly effective pandemic response in Western Australia.","Small, Michael; Cavanagh, David",IEEE Access,45,15

Assessments of detect vascular deficiencies among newly diagnosed and hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 have yet to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To assess endothelial function characteristics in relation to length of hospitalization and mortality in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and compare to patients without COVID-19. METHODS: A prospective observational study involving 180 patients with confirmed COVID-19 (COVID-19 group) or suspected and ruled out COVID-19 (Non-COVID-19 group). Clinical evaluation and flow mediated vasodilation (FMD) were performed between the first 24-48 h of hospitalization. Patients were followed until death or discharge. RESULTS: We evaluated 98 patients (COVID-19 group) and 82 (Non-COVID-19 group), COVID-19 group remained hospitalized longer and more deaths occurred compared to the Non-COVID-19 group (p = 0.01; and p < 0.01). Patients in COVID-19 group also had a significantly greater reduction in both FMDmm and FMD% (p < 0.01 in both). We found that absolute FMD&#8804;0.26 mm and relative FMD&#8804;3.43% were the ideal cutoff point to predict mortality and longer hospital stay. In Kaplan Meyer's analysis patients had a high probability of death within a period of up to 10 days of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 present endothelial vascular dysfunction early, remained hospitalized longer and had a higher number of deaths, when compared with patients without COVID-19.","Oliveira, Murilo Rezende; Back, Guilherme Dionir; da Luz Goulart, Cássia; Domingos, Bianca Cristina; Arena, Ross; Borghi-Silva, Audrey",Respir Med,45,1

This study aimed to analyze the satisfaction of patients and surgeons with the rapid expansion of telehealth at this time within the division of adult reconstructive surgery at a major urban academic tertiary hospital. METHODS: A total of 334 patients underging arthroplasty of the hip or knee who completed a telemedicine visit between 30 March and 30 April 2020 were sent a 14-question survey, scored on a five-point Likert scale. Eight adult reconstructive surgeons who used telemedicine during this time were sent a separate 14-question survey at the end of the study period. Factors influencing patient satisfaction were determined using univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression modelling. RESULTS: A total of 68 patients (20.4%) and 100% of the surgeons completed the surveys. Patients were ""Satisfied"" with their telemedicine visits (4.10/5.00 (SD 0.98)) and 19 (27.9%) would prefer telemedicine to in-person visits in the absence of COVID-19. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression modelling revealed that patients were more likely to be satisfied if their surgeon effectively responded to their questions or concerns (odds ratio (OR) 3.977; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.260 to 13.190; p = 0.019) and if their visit had a high audiovisual quality (OR 2.46; 95% CI 1.052 to 6.219; p = 0.042). Surgeons were ""Satisfied"" with their telemedicine experience (3.63/5.00 (SD 0.92)) and were ""Fairly Confident"" (4.00/5.00 (SD 0.53)) in their diagnostic accuracy despite finding the physical examinations to be only ""Slightly Effective"" (1.88/5.00 (SD 0.99)). Most adult reconstructive surgeons, seven of eight (87.5%) would continue to use telemedicine in the future. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine emerged as a valuable tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients undergoing arthroplasty and their surgeons were satisfied with telemedicine and see a role for its use after the pandemic. The audiovisual quality and the responsiveness of physicians to the concerns of patients determine their satisfaction. Future investigations should focus on improving the physical examination of patients through telemedicine and strategies for its widespread implementation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: SLE patients monitored by a single Italian centre were interviewed between February and July 2020. Patients were considered to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infections in case of 1) positive nasopharyngeal swab; 2) positive serology associated with COVID19 suggesting symptoms. The following data were also recorded: clinical symptoms, adoption of social distancing measures, disease activity and treatment discontinuation. RESULTS: 332 patients were enrolled in the study. Six patients (1.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the incidence being significantly higher in the subgroup of patients treated with biological Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (p = 0.005), while no difference was observed for other therapies, age at enrollment, disease duration, type of cumulative organ involvement or adoption of social isolation. The course of the disease was mild. Thirty-six patients (11.1%) discontinued at least part of their therapy during this time period, and 27 (8.1%) cases of disease flare were recorded. Correlation between flare and discontinuation of therapy was statistically significant (p<0.001). No significant increase of rate of flare in a subgroup of the same patients during 2020 was observed. CONCLUSION: Treatment discontinuation seems to be an important cause of disease flare. Our findings suggest that abrupt drug withdrawal should be avoided or evaluated with caution on the basis of individual infection risk and comorbidities.","Zucchi, Dina; Tani, Chiara; Elefante, Elena; Stagnaro, Chiara; Carli, Linda; Signorini, Viola; Ferro, Francesco; Trentin, Francesca; Fulvio, Giovanni; Cardelli, Chiara; Di Battista, Marco; Governato, Gianmaria; Figliomeni, Antonio; Mosca, Marta",PLoS One,45,16

One population that has been scarcely studied is non-neutropenic patients admitted specifically to medical ICUs. Even less is known about the broader category of medical ICU patients without active oncological disease. This group constitutes a very large share of the patients requiring critical care across the globe, especially in the era of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We analysed medical ICU candidaemia episodes that occurred in non-oncological patients in our tertiary academic centre in the United States from May 2014 to October 2020 to determine the incidence and species distribution of the associated isolates. We then separately considered non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 cases and compared their characteristics. In the non-COVID-19 group, there were 38 cases for an incidence of 1.1% and rate of 11/1000 admissions. In the COVID-19 group, there were 12 cases for an incidence of 5.1% and rate of 51/1000 admissions. In the entire sample, as well as separately in the non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 groups,Candida albicans accounted for a minority of isolates. Compared to non-COVID-19 patients with candidaemia, COVID-19 patients had lower ICU admission SOFA score but longer ICU length of stay and central venous catheter dwell time at candidaemia detection. This study provides valuable insight into the incidence and species distribution of candidaemia cases occurring in non-oncological critically ill patients and identifies informative differences between non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 patients.","Macauley, Precious; Epelbaum, Oleg",Mycoses,45,1

Therefore, our present study aimed to (i) assess the prevalence of burnout and levels of job satisfaction among physicians in Jordan, and (ii) explore physicians' opinions, experiences, and perceptions during the pandemic crisis. METHODS: This was a mixed-method study that utilized a structured web-based questionnaire and semi-structured individual interviews. The 10-Item Burnout Measure-Short version (BMS), and the 5-Item Short Index of Job Satisfaction (SIJS) were adopted to assess occupational burnout and job satisfaction, respectively. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, based on a conceptual framework that was developed from Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory of Motivation and Job Demands-Resources Model. Descriptive statistics and regression models, as well as inductive thematic analysis, were used to analyze quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 973 survey responses and 11 interviews were included in our analysis. The prevalence of burnout among physicians was (57.7%). Several significant factors were positively associated with burnout, including female gender, working at highly loaded hospitals, working for long hours, doing night shifts, lack of sufficient access to personal protective equipment, and being positively tested for SARS-CoV-2. Regarding job satisfaction, regression analysis revealed that age was positively associated with higher levels of job satisfaction. On contrary, being a general practitioner or specialist, working at highly loaded hospitals, low salaries, and suffering from burnout have predicted lower levels of job satisfaction. Besides, four themes have emerged from the thematic analysis: (i) Work-induced psychological distress during the pandemic, (ii) Decision-driven satisfactory and dissatisfactory experiences, (iii) Impact of the pandemic on doctor-patient communication and professional skills, and (iv) Economic impacts of the pandemic crisis and lockdown. CONCLUSION: A significant physical and psychological burden was associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Reliable efforts should be implemented aiming at protecting physicians' physical and mental wellbeing, enhancing their working conditions, and raising awareness about burnout.

METHODS: Clinical, laboratory, radiology, and treatment data of 41 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were retrospectively collected. The population was stratified by disease severity as mild, moderate, or severe, based on guidelines of the National Health and Medical Commission of China. RESULTS: The 41 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were studied, and the median age was 45 years (interquartile range [IQR], 31-53; range, 10-87 years) and 18 patients (43.9%) were female. All of the patients had recently visited Wuhan or other places (ie, Beijing, Thailand) or had Wuhan-related exposure. Common symptoms included fever (32[78%]) and cough (29[70.7%]). All patients were without hepatitis B/C virus hepatitis. CRP (C-reactive protein, 11.3 mg/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 2.45-35.2]) was elevated in 22 patients (53.7%), and cardiac troponin I (1.5 ng/mL [IQR, 0.8-5.0]) was elevated in 41 patients (100%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral ground glass opacity (GGO) or GGO with consolidation in the lungs of 27(65.9%) patients. 31(75.6%) patients had an abnormal electrocardiograph (ECG). Comparing the three groups, the levels of CRP and cardiac troponin I, GGO distribution in bilateral lungs, and electrocardiogram changes were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Cardiac troponin I had a strong positive correlation with CRP (r = 0.704, p = 0.042) and LDH (r = 0.738, p = 0.037). CONCLUSION: Significant differences among the groups suggest that several clinical parameters may serve as biomarkers of COVID-19 severity at hospital admission. Elevated cTnI could be considered as a predictor of severe COVID-19, reflecting the prognosis of patients with severe COVID-19.

It is difficult to stop the occurrence of new pathogens in the future due to the interconnection among humans, animals, and the environment. However, it is possible to face a new disease or to reduce the risk of its spread by implementing better early warning systems and effective disease control and prevention, e.g., effective global surveillance, development of technology for better diagnostics, effective treatments, and vaccines, the global political will to respond to any threats and multidisciplinary collaboration involving all sectors in charge of good health maintenance.

The problem is structured as an optimal control system for tracking a reference value, corresponding to the maximum usage level of a critical resource, such as ICU beds. However, instead of using conventional optimal control methods, RL is used to find optimal control policies. A framework was developed to calculate optimal cyclic lockdown timings using an RL-based on-off controller. The RL-based controller is implemented as an RL agent that interacts with an epidemic simulator, implemented as an extended SEIR epidemic model. The RL agent learns a policy function that produces an optimal sequence of open/lockdown decisions such that goals specified in the RL reward function are optimized. Two concurrent goals were used: the first one is a public health goal that minimizes overshoots of ICU bed usage above an ICU bed threshold, and the second one is a socio-economic goal that minimizes the time spent under lockdowns. It is assumed that cyclic lockdowns are considered as a temporary alternative to extended lockdowns when a region faces imminent danger of overpassing resource capacity limits and when imposing an extended lockdown would cause severe social and economic consequences due to lack of necessary economic resources to support its affected population during an extended lockdown.","Arango, Mauricio; Pelov, Lyudmil",,45,16

Working with Indigenous communities and organisations requires relationship building, collaboration and ceremony. In these unprecedented times, scholars cannot simply continue ""business as usual"". They must adapt everything, including how they teach, learn and work with Indigenous peoples, who are particularly vulnerable to this pandemic. Reflecting on the impacts that have already occurred and those that are still likely to come, the authors discuss what changes may need to be made in academia to support diverse actors within their scholarly community.

PA acts as a selective Ca++-dependent K-channels (Maxi-K, BK) antagonist in brain, causing motor system dysfunctions including tremors and seizures. However, its molecular mechanism at the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is still ambiguous. The Mediterranean diet key ingredient extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) provides a variety of minor bioactive phenolics. (+)-Pinoresinol (PN) and (+)-1-acetoxypinoresinol (AC) are naturally occurring lignans in EVOO with diverse biological activities. AC exclusively occurs in EVOO unlike PN, which occur in several plants. Results suggest that PA neurotoxicity molecular mechanism is mediated, in part, through distortion of JAK/STAT pathway. PA selectively activated STAT1 pathway, independently of IFN-Î³ pathway, in vitro in Schwann cells and in vivo in Swiss albino mice sciatic nerves. Preliminary in vitro screening of EVOO phenolic compounds library for ability to reverse PA toxicity on Schwann cells revealed PN and AC as potential hits. In a Swiss albino mouse model, AC significantly minimized the fatality after intra-peritoneal administration of PA fatal doses and normalized most biochemical factors by modulating the STAT1 expression. The olive lignan AC is a novel lead that can prevent the neurotoxicity of food-contaminating tremorgenic indole alkaloid mycotoxins.","Qusa, Mohammed; Abdelwahed, Khaldoun S; Meyer, Sharon; El Sayed, Khalid A",ACS chem. neurosci,45,1

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted at King Abdullah Hospital in Bisha Province, Saudi Arabia, from March 20 to June 30, 2020. Patients of different age groups were confirmed as having COVID-19 infection using a real-time polymerase chain reaction. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of the patients were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 132 patients, 85 were male and 47 were female, with a mean age of 50.9 years (SD±16.7). The patients were elderly (n = 29) and adults (n = 103). Of these, 54 (40.9%) had comorbidities, (25%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 12 (9.1%) died. On admission, the main clinical manifestations were fever (84.1%), cough (64.4%), shortness of breath (25%), chest pain (20.5%), and fatigue (18.2%). In all patients, increased neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes were observed. Patients' lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated. C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated in 48.5%, D-dimer in 43.2%, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in 40.9% of patients. The elderly showed higher neutrophil (p = 0.011) and lower lymphocyte (p = 0.009) counts than adults. Glucose, creatine kinase-MB, LDH, bilirubin, D-dimer, and ESR were significantly higher in the elderly than in the adults. The COVID-19 death group had a higher leucocyte count (p = 0.036), and higher urea (p = 0.029) and potassium (p = 0.022) than the recovered group but had a lower hemoglobin concentration (p = 0.018).

This articles discusses how chronological age and the category of 'older people' were addressed in social and health policies and the discourses surrounding the outbreak of COVID-19. It examines how these processes can affect the position of older people in society and the relationships between different generations. The article focuses on four main arguments. First, it points out that chronological age was established as a significant vector defining the human position in society during the pandemic. Second, it argues that the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to accelerate age-divisions in our societies and may contribute to the growth of ageist representations. Third, the way age was mobilised and depicted in debates surrounding the pandemic situation has also had an impact on intergenerational solidarity and may reinforce antagonism between generations. Fourth, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed some key structural problems in the field of elderly care and paternalistic attitudes that persist in relation to older people. The second part of the article discusses possible challenges relating to ageism, the well-being of older people, and elderly care that need to be addressed by (social) gerontology and the social sciences and that have been further exacerbated (not only) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Marhánková, Jaroslava Hasmanová",Sociologicky Casopis,45,33

The properties of chaotic neurons inspires us to employ them in artificial learning systems. Here, we propose a Neurochaos Learning (NL) architecture, where the neurons used to extract features from data are 1D chaotic maps. ChaosFEX+SVM, an instance of this NL architecture, is proposed as a hybrid combination of chaos and classical machine learning algorithm. We formally prove that a single layer of NL with a finite number of 1D chaotic neurons satisfies the Universal Approximation Theorem with an exact value for the number of chaotic neurons needed to approximate a discrete real valued function with finite support. This is made possible due to the topological transitivity property of chaos and the existence of uncountably infinite number of dense orbits for the chosen 1D chaotic map. The chaotic neurons in NL get activated under the presence of an input stimulus (data) and output a chaotic firing trajectory. From such chaotic firing trajectories of individual neurons of NL, we extract Firing Time, Firing Rate, Energy and Entropy that constitute ChaosFEX features. These ChaosFEX features are then fed to a Support Vector Machine with linear kernel for classification. The effectiveness of chaotic feature engineering performed by NL (ChaosFEX+SVM) is demonstrated for synthetic and real world datasets in the low and high training sample regimes. Specifically, we consider the problem of classification of genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and others). With just one training sample per class for 1000 random trials of training, we report an average macro F1-score>0.99 for the classification of SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV-1 genome sequences. Robustness of ChaosFEX features to additive noise is also demonstrated.","Harikrishnan, NB; Pranay, SY; Nagaraj, Nithin",,45,29

Reacting to the pandemic and adaptation in the ""new normal"" have been challenging tasks. Exiting the pandemic can lead to some after-shock effects such as ""disruption tails."" While the research community has undertaken considerable efforts to predict the pandemic's impacts and examine supply chain adaptive behaviors during the pandemic, little is known about supply chain management in the course of pandemic elimination and post-disruption recovery. If capacity and inventory management are unaware of the after-shock risks, this can result in highly destabilized production-inventory dynamics and decreased performance in the post-disruption period causing product deficits in the markets and high inventory costs in the supply chains. In this paper, we use a discrete-event simulation model to investigate some exit strategies for a supply chain in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our model can inform managers about the existence and risk of disruption tails in their supply chains and guide the selection of post-pandemic recovery strategies. Our results show that supply chains with postponed demand and shutdown capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic are particularly prone to disruption tails. We then developed and examined two strategies to avoid these disruption tails. First, we observed a conjunction of recovery and supply chain coordination which mitigates the impact of disruption tails by demand smoothing over time in the post-disruption period. Second, we found a gradual capacity ramp-up prior to expected peaks of postponed demand to be an effective strategy for disruption tail control.","Ivanov, Dmitry",Ann Oper Res,45,9

Although resistance exercise (RE) and protein supplementation partially protect against sarcopenia under controlled conditions, the efficacy of home-based, unsupervised RE (HBRE) and multi-ingredient supplementation (MIS) is largely unknown. In this randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind trial, we examined the effects of HBRE/MIS on muscle mass, strength, and function in free-living, older men. Thirty-two sedentary men underwent twelve weeks of home-based resistance band training (3 d/week), in combination with daily intake of a novel five-nutrient supplement ('Muscle5'; M5, n = 16, 77.4 ± 2.8 y) containing whey, micellar casein, creatine, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids, or an isocaloric/isonitrogenous placebo (PLA; n = 16, 74.4 ± 1.3 y), containing collagen and sunflower oil.

Textual sentiment classification harnesses the full computational potential of deep learning models. Typically, these research works are carried either with a popular open-source data corpus, or self-extracted short phrase texts from Twitter, Reddit, or web-scrapped text data from other resources. Rarely do we see a large amount of data on a current ongoing event is being collected and cultured further. Also, an even more complex task would be to model the data from a currently ongoing event, not only for scaling the sentiment accuracy but also for making a predictive analysis for the same. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for achieving sentiment evaluation accuracy by using a deep neural network on live-streamed tweets on Coronavirus and future case growth prediction. We develop a large tweet corpus exclusively based on the Coronavirus tweets. We split the data into train and test sets, alongside we perform polarity classification and trend analysis. The refined outcome from the trend analysis helps to train the data to provide an incremental learning curvature for our neural network, and we obtain an accuracy of 90.67%. Finally, we provide a statistical-based future prediction for Coronavirus cases growth. Not only our model outperforms several previous state-of-art experiments in overall sentiment accuracy comparison for similar tasks, but it also maintains a throughout performance stability among all the test cases when tested with several popular open-source text corpora.","Das, Sourav; Kolya, Anup Kumar",Evol Intell,45,29

Patient waiting times for cataract surgeries in many healthcare settings have increased recently due to the prolonged stop or slowdown of elective cataract surgery as a result of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). The aim of this review is to highlight the impact of such a ""de-prioritization"" of cataract surgery and to summarize some critical issues and useful hints on how to reorganize cataract pathways, with a special focus on perioperative diagnostic tools during the recovery phase and beyond. The experiences of a group of surgeons originating from nine different countries, named the European COVID-19 Cataract Group (EUROCOVCAT), have been combined with the literature and recommendations from scientific ophthalmic societies and healthcare institutions. Key considerations for elective cataract surgery should include the reduction of the number of unnecessary visits and examinations, adoption of precautionary measures, and implementation of telemedicine instruments. New strategies should be adopted to provide an adequate level of assistance and to guarantee safety conditions.

Here, we investigate whether maternal influenza infection has adverse effects on immune responses in offspring. We establish a two-hit mouse model to study the effect of maternal influenza A virus infection (first hit) on vulnerability of offspring to heterologous infections (second hit) in later life. Offspring born to influenza A virus infected mothers are stunted in growth and more vulnerable to heterologous infections (influenza B virus and MRSA) than those born to PBS- or poly(I:C)-treated mothers. Enhanced vulnerability to infection in neonates is associated with reduced haematopoetic development and immune responses. In particular, alveolar macrophages of offspring exposed to maternal influenza have reduced capacity to clear second hit pathogens. This impaired pathogen clearance is partially reversed by adoptive transfer of alveolar macrophages from healthy offspring born to uninfected dams. These findings suggest that maternal influenza infection may impair immune ontogeny and increase susceptibility to early life infections of offspring.","Jacobsen, Henning; Walendy-Gnirß, Kerstin; Tekin-Bubenheim, Nilgün; Kouassi, Nancy Mounogou; Ben-Batalla, Isabel; Berenbrok, Nikolaus; Wolff, Martin; Dos Reis, Vinicius Pinho; Zickler, Martin; Scholl, Lucas; Gries, Annette; Jania, Hanna; Kloetgen, Andreas; Düsedau, Arne; Pilnitz-Stolze, Gundula; Jeridi, Aicha; Yildirim, Ali Önder; Fuchs, Helmut; Gailus-Durner, Valerie; Stoeger, Claudia; de Angelis, Martin Hrabe; Manuylova, Tatjana; Klingel, Karin; Culley, Fiona J; Behrends, Jochen; Loges, Sonja; Schneider, Bianca; Krauss-Etschmann, Susanne; Openshaw, Peter; Gabriel, Gülsah",Nat Commun,45,24

However, findings from epidemiological studies have been inconsistent. The objective of this study was to assess the association between Se intake and risk of breast cancer in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). METHODS: This study included 145,033 postmenopausal women 50-79 years who completed baseline questionnaires between October 1993 and December 1998, which addressed dietary and supplemental Se intake and breast cancer risk factors. The association between baseline Se intake and incident breast cancer was examined in Cox proportional hazards analysis. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 15.5 years, 9487 cases of invasive breast cancer were identified. Total Se (highest versus lowest quartile: HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92-1.09, Ptrend = 0.66), dietary Se (highest versus lowest quartile: HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.89-1.08, Ptrend = 0.61), and supplemental Se (yes versus no: HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95-1.03) were not associated with breast cancer incidence. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that Se intake is not associated with incident breast cancer among postmenopausal women in the United States. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings by using biomarkers such as toenail Se to reduce the potential for misclassification of Se status.","Guo, Dan; Hendryx, Michael; Liang, Xiaoyun; Manson, JoAnn E; He, Ka; Vitolins, Mara Z; Li, Yueyao; Luo, Juhua",Breast Cancer Res Treat,45,3

Patients and methods: Single center retrospective observational study. All patients hospitalized, at Delta Regional Medical Center, regional hospital in the Mississippi Delta, with a COVID-19 diagnosis and discharged between March 1st and September 30th, 2020 are included. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality in relation to receipt of tofacitinib alone or in addition to dexamethasone (designated as the Tofacitinib Group), vs dexamethasone alone (designated as the Dexamethasone Group). Results: Of 269 eligible patients, 138 (51.3%) received tofacitinib uniformly and 131 (48.7%) patients received dexamethasone without tofacitinib. A total of 44 patients expired: 14 (31.82%) in the Tofacitinib Group and 30 (68.18%) in the Dexamethasone Group. The proportions of death among the Tofacitinib and Dexamethasone groups were respectively, 10.14% and 22.90%. This represents a 70% reduction in odds of dying among the Tofacitinib group compared to the Dexamethasone group after adjusting for age and clinical parameters captured at hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio=0.30, 95% confidence interval =0.12-0.76; p=0.01). Conclusions: The in-patient treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia has rapidly evolved. The addition of dexamethasone has made a relevant improvement on survival. Other immunomodulators are yet to show an impact. Here we present the potential survival benefit of the JAK-STAT inhibitor tofacitinib on COVID-19 pneumonia.

Neurologically impaired children are a vulnerable population with specific needs in terms of protection against infection and access to health services. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the effects of lockdown on the health of children with neurological disorders and on their access to care during lockdown. METHODS: Data from 514 children (282 males - 232 females) were collected through physician-administered interviews to investigate: the occurrence of viral-like physical symptoms, the correlation between the risk of developing such symptoms and several demographic and clinical variables, the occurrence of any worsening of the children's neurological conditions during lockdown, and their access to care services during this period. RESULTS: 49.1% experienced at least one symptom during the study period, but no child developed severe complications. The prevalence of symptoms was significantly lower during lockdown than during the previous two months. The underlying neurological condition worsened in 11.5% of the patients. Children who regularly left the home during lockdown were greater risk of exhibiting symptoms. During lockdown, 67.7% had a specialist appointment cancelled, 52.6% contacted their paediatrician, and 30.9% contacted their child neuropsychiatrist. Among patients who usually receive rehabilitation, 49.5% continued remotely. CONCLUSION: Lockdown protected children from infections. Telemedicine and telerehabilitation constituted a valid alternative for the care and treatment of these children, but they should not become a widespread and definitive model of care. COVID-19 and other emergency response plans must take into account the specific needs of children with disabilities.","Bova, Stefania Maria; Basso, Martina; Bianchi, Marta Francesca; Savaré, Laura; Ferrara, Giusi; Mura, Eleonora; Redaelli, Maria Gaia; Olivieri, Ivana; Veggiotti, Pierangelo",Disabil Health J,45,16

Barriers include, but are not limited to, the paucity of test norms, uncertainty about the equivalence of translated neuropsychological tests, and limited proficiency in the provision of culturally competent services. Similar issues generalize to telephone- and video-based administration of neuropsychological tests or teleneuropsychology (TeleNP) with Hispanics/Latinos (as), and few studies have examined its feasibility and validity in this group. The sudden onset of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted neuropsychologists to identify alternative ways to provide equitable care. Clinicians providing TeleNP to this population during (and after) the pandemic must consider safety, professional factors, and systemic barriers to accessing and benefitting from virtual modalities. METHOD: This clinical process manuscript describes how cross-cultural neuropsychologists across five U.S. academic institutions serving Hispanics/Latinos (as) developed TeleNP models of care during the pandemic. RESULTS: Workflows, test batteries, and resources for TeleNP assessment with monolingual and bilingual Spanish-speaking patients are included. Factors guiding model development and informing decisions to incorporate virtual administration of neuropsychological tests into their practice are also discussed.

In these situations, the wireless networks may become congested or completely disrupted and may not be adequate to support the traffic generated by rescuers. It is also considered as the key tool in Corona Virus (COVID-19) battle. Moreover, the conventional approaches with fixed gateways may not work either, and this might lead to decoding errors due to the large distance between mobile nodes and the gateway. To avoid the decoding errors and improve the reliability of the messages, we propose to use intermediate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to transfer messages from ground-based Long Range (LoRa) nodes to the remote base station (BS). Specifically, this UAV-enabled LoRa architecture is based on the ad hoc WiFi network, wherein, UAVs act as relays for the traffic generated between LoRa nodes and BS. To make the architecture more efficient, a distributed topology control algorithm is also proposed for UAVs. The algorithm is based on virtual spring forces and movement prediction technique that periodically updates the UAV topology to adapt to the movement of the ground-based LoRa nodes that move on the surface. The simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed approach for packet reception rate and average delay quality of service (QoS) metrics. It is observed that the mechanisms implemented in a UAV-enabled LoRa network effectively help to improve the packet reception rate with nominal buffer delays.","Saraereh, Omar A; Alsaraira, Amer; Khan, Imran; Uthansakul, Peerapong",,45,29

Ten patients from 2 families and 1 hospital were involved in the transmission. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted an epidemiological investigation to identify the cluster transmission of COVID-19. The demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and cluster characteristics were described and analyzed. RESULTS From January 27 to February 13, 2020, a total of 10 individuals were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 by the nucleic acid testing of nasopharyngeal swabs from 2 families and 1 hospital. Among the confirmed cases, 7 had atypical clinical symptoms and 3 were asymptomatic. The median times from onset to diagnosis and to discharge were 3.5 days (range, 1-5 days) and 19.5 days (range, 16-38 days), respectively. There were 4 patients whose exposure dates were 1, 3, 3, and 2 days earlier than the onset dates of their previous-generation cases, respectively. Four prevention and control measures were effectively used to interrupt the disease transmission. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 can be easily transmitted within families and in hospitals, and asymptomatic patients could act as a source of disease transmission. The results of this outbreak at the early epidemic stage support the recommendation that individuals with confirmed COVID-19 and all their close contacts should be subjected to medical quarantined observation and nucleic acid screening as early as possible, even if they do not have any symptoms. Meanwhile, people in high-risk areas should improve their protective measures.","Zhang, Hui; Song, Shuxuan; Chen, Zhijun; Bai, Miao; He, Zhen; Fu, Ting; Liu, Kun; Shao, Zhongjun",Med Sci Monit,45,1

Thus, we have decided to conduct this meta-analysis to explore this relationship. We complied to the PRISMA guidelines in conducting this meta-analysis. PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and medRxiv were searched until the 15th of February, 2021. We used the Random effect model in Meta XL, version 5.3 to pool the included studies. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q heterogeneity test and I². This meta-analysis included 634,338 COVID-19 patients from 16 studies. Our findings revealed that pre-diagnosis with mental disorders increased the risk of COVID-19 mortality and severity. This increase in the risk of COVID-19 mortality and severity remained significant in the model that only included the studies that adjusted for confounding variables. Furthermore, higher mortality was noticed in the included studies among schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders patients compared to mood disorders patients. In this meta-analysis we provided two models which both reported a significant increase in the risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality among patients with mental disorders, and with the upcoming COVID-19 vaccines, we recommend to give this category the priority in the vaccination campaigns along with medical health providers and elderly.","Toubasi, Ahmad A; AbuAnzeh, Rand B; Tawileh, Hind B Abu; Aldebei, Renad H; Alryalat, Saif Aldeen S",Psychiatry Res,45,10

As per the literature, the SARS-CoV-2 is known to exploit humanACE2 receptors (similar toprevious SARS-CoV-1) for gaining entry into the host cell for invasion, infection, multiplication and pathogenesis. However, considering the higher infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 along with the complex etiology and pathophysiological outcomes seen in COVID-19 patients, it seems that there may be an alternate receptor for SARS-CoV-2. I performed comparative protein sequence analysis, database based gene expression profiling, bioinformatics based molecular docking using authentic tools and techniques for unveiling the molecular basis of high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to previous known coronaviruses. My study revealed that SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV) harbors a RGD motif in its receptor binding domain (RBD) and the motif is absent in all other previously known SARS-CoVs. The RGD motif is well known for its role in cell-attachment and cell-adhesion. My hypothesis is that the SARS-CoV-2 may be (via RGD) exploiting integrins, that have high expression in lungs and all other vital organs, for invading host cells. However, an experimental verification is required. The expression of ACE2, which is a known receptor for SARS-CoV-2, was found to be negligible in lungs. I assume that higher infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 could be due to this RGD-integrin mediated acquired cell-adhesive property. Gene expression profiling revealed that expression of integrins is significantly high in lung cells, in particular &#945;vß6, &#945;5ß1, &#945;vß8 and an ECM protein, ICAM1. The molecular docking experiment showed the RBD of spike protein binds with integrins precisely at RGD motif in a similar manner as a synthetic RGD peptide binds to integrins as found by other researchers. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a number of phosphorylation sites that can induce cAMP, PKC, Tyr signaling pathways. These pathways either activate calcium ion channels or get activated by calcium. In fact, integrins have calcium & metal binding sites that were predicted around and in vicinity of RGD-integrin docking site in our analysis which suggests that RGD-integrins interaction possibly occurs in calcium-dependent manner. The higher expression of integrins in lungs along with their previously known high binding affinity (~KD = 4.0 nM) for virus RGD motif could serve as a possible explanation for high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. On the contrary, human ACE2 has lower expression in lungs and its high binding affinity (~KD = 15 nM) for spike RBD alone could not manifest significant virus-host attachment. This suggests that besides human ACE2, an additional or alternate receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is likely to exist. A highly relevant evidence never reported earlier which corroborate in favor of RGD-integrins mediated virus-host attachment is an unleashed cytokine storm which causes due to activation of TNF-&#945; and IL-6 activation; and integrins role in their activation is also well established. Altogether, the current study has highlighted possible role of calcium and other divalent ions in RGD-integrins interaction for virus invasion into host cells and suggested that lowering divalent ion in lungs could avert virus-host cells attachment.","Dakal, Tikam Chand",Immunobiology,45,24

In an effort to prevent hospital-acquired COVID-19 infections, most hospitals have severely curtailed elective surgery, performing only surgeries if the patient's survival or permanent function would be compromised by a delay in surgery. As hospitals emerge from the pandemic, it will be necessary to progressively increase surgical activity at a time when hospitals continue to care for COVID-19 patients. In an attempt to mitigate the risk of nosocomial infection, we have created a patient care pathway designed to minimize risk of exposure of patients coming into the hospital for scheduled procedures. The COVID-minimal surgery pathway is a predetermined patient flow, which dictates the locations, personnel, and materials that come in contact with our cancer surgery population, designed to minimize risk for virus transmission. We outline the approach that allowed a large academic medical center to create a COVID-minimal cancer surgery pathway within 7 days of initiating discussions. Although the pathway represents a combination of recommended practices, there are no data to support its efficacy. We share the pathway concept and our experience so that others wishing to similarly align staff and resources toward the protection of patients may have an easier time navigating the process.","Boffa, Daniel J; Judson, Benjamin L; Billingsley, Kevin G; Galetta, Domenico; Fontanez, Paul; Odermatt, Craig; Lindner, Kristy; Mitchell, Marci R; Henderson, Cara M; Carafeno, Tracy; Pinto, Josephine; Wagner, Jane A; Ancuta, Michael M; Beley, Peggy; Turner, Anne L; Banack, Trevor; Laurans, Maxwell S; Johnson, Dirk C; Yoo, Peter S; Morton, John M; Zurich, Holly; Davis, Kimberly; Ahuja, Nita",Ann Thorac Surg,45,16

The medical and scientific communities have also been confronted by an urgent need to better understand the mechanism of host-virus interaction aimed at developing therapies and vaccines. Since this viral disease can trigger a strong innate immune response, causing severe damage to the pulmonary tract, immunotherapies have also been explored as a means to verify the immunomodulatory effect and improve clinical outcomes, whilst the comprehensive COVID-19 immunology still remains under investigation. In this review, both cellular and molecular immunopathology as well as hemostatic disorders induced by SARS-CoV-2 are summarized. The immunotherapeutic approaches based on the most recent clinical and nonclinical studies, emphasizing their effects for the treatment of COVID-19, are also addressed.

Many previous studies have investigated the impact of working from home on the productivity of employees. However, most of these studies usually use a qualitative analysis method such as survey and interview, and the studied participants do not work from home for a long continuing time. Due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a large number of companies asked their employees to work from home, which provides us an opportunity to investigate whether working from home affects their productivity. In this study, to investigate the difference of developer productivity between working from home and working onsite, we conduct a quantitative analysis based on a dataset of developers' daily activities from Baidu Inc, one of the largest IT companies in China. In total, we collected approximately four thousand records of 139 developers' activities of 138 working days. Out of these records, 1,103 records are submitted when developers work from home due to COVID-19 pandemic. We find that WFH has both positive and negative impacts on developer productivity in terms of different metrics, e.g., the number of builds/commits/code reviews. We also notice that working from home has different impacts on projects with different characteristics including programming language, project type/age/size. For example, working from home has a negative impact on developer productivity for large projects. Additionally, we find that productivity varies for different developers. Based on these findings, we get some feedbacks from developers of Baidu and understand some reasons why WFH has different impacts on developer productivity.","Bao, Lingfeng; Li, Tao; Xia, Xin; Zhu, Kaiyu; Li, Hui; Yang, Xiaohu",,45,1

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) have been used for its treatment but their safety and efficacy remain uncertain. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review to synthesize the available data on the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Two reviewers searched for published and pre-published relevant articles between December 2019 and 8 June 2020. The data from the selected studies were abstracted and analyzed for efficacy and safety outcomes. Critical appraisal of the evidence was done by Cochrane risk of bias tool and Newcastle Ottawa Scale. The quality of evidence was graded as per the GRADE approach. RESULTS: We reviewed 12 observational and 3 randomized trials which included 10,659 patients of whom 5713 received CQ/HCQ and 4966 received only standard of care. The efficacy of CQ/HCQ for COVID-19 was inconsistent across the studies. Meta-analysis of included studies revealed no significant reduction in mortality with HCQ use [RR 0.98 95% CI 0.66-1.46], time to fever resolution (mean difference - 0.54 days (- 1.19-011)) or clinical deterioration/development of ARDS with HCQ [RR 0.90 95% CI 0.47-1.71]. There was a higher risk of ECG abnormalities/arrhythmia with HCQ/CQ [RR 1.46 95% CI 1.04 to 2.06]. The quality of evidence was graded as very low for these outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSION: The available evidence suggests that CQ or HCQ does not improve clinical outcomes in COVID-19.

Our experiment and simulation show that the output terahertz energy greatly enhances when the input laser pulse is highly chirped, contrary to a common optical rectification process. We find this abnormal behavior is attributed to a linear electro-optic (or Pockels) effect, in which the laser pulse propagating in LiNbO$_3$ is modulated by the terahertz field it produces, and this in turn drives optical rectification more effectively to produce the terahertz field. This resonant cascading effect can greatly increase terahertz conversion efficiencies when the input laser pulse is properly pre-chirped with additional third order dispersion. We also observe similar multicycle terahertz emission from lithium tantalate (LiTaO$_3$) at 14 THz and barium borate (BBO) at 7 THz, 10.6 THz, and 14.6 THz, all produced by narrowband phase-matched optical rectification.","Jang, Dogeun; Kim, Ki-Yong",,45,29

We develop two new techniques (individual contribution encoding and warm start) to handle categorical variables. We perform experiments showing that the predicates found by BOExplain have a higher degree of explanation compared to those found by the state-of-the-art query explanation engines. We also show that BOExplain is effective at deriving explanations for inference queries from source and training data on a variety of real-world datasets. BOExplain is open-sourced as a Python package at https://github.com/sfu-db/BOExplain.","Lockhart, Brandon; Peng, Jinglin; Wu, Weiyuan; Wang, Jiannan; Wu, Eugene",,45,26

Mentoring through formal or informal channels is one way to offer assistance to such students. During COVID-19 lockdowns, as classes and work moved online, mentoring also transitioned online. Electronic mentoring, or e-mentoring, was implemented formally by some universities and informally by independent researchers. This article describes the informal mentoring experiences of the lead author with 8 female student researchers, 6 of whom were mentored online. The students represented different racial and ethnic backgrounds, offering a collection of e-mentoring case studies during the pandemic. These independent field reports should not be assumed to represent any of the students' 6 universities, but they are a sample of what can be achieved by invested e-mentors. By sharing these anecdotal experiences, the authors call on all researchers of underrepresented groups to consider e-mentoring to support underrepresented student researchers and diversify the public health research field.","Mahayosnand, Ponn P; Zanders, Lavezza; Sabra, Z M; Essa, Saman; Ahmed, Samiha; Bermejo, Diana Mora; Funmilayo, Maryam; Sabra, D M; Ablay, Sheilamae",Health Secur,45,9

OBJECTIVES: To estimate excess demand for hospital beds due to COVID-19, the net financial impact of eliminating elective admissions in order to meet demand, and to explore the scenario when demand remains below capacity. RESEARCH DESIGN: An economic simulation to estimate the net financial impact of halting elective admissions, combining epidemiological reports, the US Census, American Hospital Association Annual Survey, and the National Inpatient Sample. Deterministic sensitivity analyses explored the results while varying assumptions for demand and capacity. SUBJECTS: Inputs regarding disease prevalence and inpatient utilization were representative of the US population. Our base case relied on a hospital admission rate reported by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of 137.6 per 100,000, with the highest rates in people aged 65 years and older (378.8 per 100,000) and 50-64 years (207.4 per 100,000). On average, elective admissions accounted for 20% of total hospital admissions, and the average rate of unoccupied beds across hospitals was 30%. MEASURES: Net financial impact of halting elective admissions. RESULTS: On average, hospitals COVID-19 demand for hospital bed-days fell well short of hospital capacity, resulting in a substantial financial loss. The net financial impact of a 90-day COVID surge on a hospital was only favorable under a narrow circumstance when capacity was filled by a high proportion of COVID-19 cases among hospitals with low rates of elective admissions. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals that restricted elective care took on a substantial financial risk, potentially threatening viability. A sustainable public policy should therefore consider support to hospitals that responsibly served their communities through the crisis.","Martin, Brook I; Brodke, Darrel S; Wilson, Fernando A; Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn; Nelson, Richard E",Med Care,45,3

In our Introductory Biology course, we ask students to describe the basic structure of the four biological macromolecules and link the basic monomeric structure with the overall function of the biological molecule. While most of our students are adept at memorizing basic facts, we find that only approximately 45% of the students are able to thoroughly articulate how the structure of the macromolecule relates to its function. To improve this metric and increase student engagement, we created an active learning module that consists of three parts: Research on an assigned biological molecule, design of a 3D printed learning aid (for example, 3D print four different amino acids that come together in specific ways using magnets), and finally the design and presentation of a learning module to the class that incorporates hands-on manipulation of their learning aid. Based on assessment questions as well as student reflections, this project has improved student engagement in the class. During Covid-19, two different alterations were made in response to social-distancing restrictions ? removal of the 3D printed model component, leaving the design aspects intact, and replacement of the the design components of the module with an individual presentation on one of the biological macromolecules using the same inquiry materials.

The Committee followed national best practices in CHW engagement. A CHW and an academic team identified CHWs and employers statewide, administered a survey in partnership with a CHW professional association, and conducted in-depth interviews with CHWs and employers. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize survey data and applied thematic analysis was used to interpret interview transcripts. Sixty-five CHWs and 37 employers participated in the survey. Twenty-one CHWs and 15 employers completed interviews. Survey data indicated that Louisiana CHW roles and activities are consistent with national research. Interviews revealed a lack of knowledge about CHWs among key stakeholders, CHW workforce challenges including lack of community and professional resources, and differing ideas about the value of common workforce development practices such as standardized training and credentialing. Findings suggest a need for widespread education about CHWs and support for CHW participation in professional associations to address common workforce challenges.

DESIGN: Confidential, self-administered questionnaire. SETTING: One hundred twenty-seven U.S. pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers. SUBJECTS: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation center program directors and coordinators. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In March 2020, a survey was sent to 127 pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers asking them to report their current hospital extracorporeal membrane oxygenation guidelines for coronavirus disease 2019-positive patients. Respondents were also asked their opinion on three ethical dilemmas including: prioritization of children over adults for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use, institution of do-not-resuscitate orders, and the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for coronavirus disease 2019-positive patients. Forty-seven extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers had enacted guidelines including 46 (100%) that offer venovenous-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and 42 (89%) that offer venoarterial-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for coronavirus disease 2019-positive pediatric patients. Forty-four centers (94%) stated that the indications for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation candidacy in coronavirus disease 2019 disease were similar to those used in other viral illnesses, such as respiratory syncytial virus or influenza. Most program directors (98%) did not endorse that children hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 should be made do-not-resuscitate and had variable opinions on whether children should be given higher priority over adults when rationing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Over half of program directors (60%) did not support the use of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for coronavirus disease 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation centers have proactively established guidelines for the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for coronavirus disease 2019-related illnesses. Further work is needed to help guide the fair allocation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation resources and to determine the appropriateness of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation.","MacGregor, Robert M; Antiel, Ryan M; Najaf, Tasnim; Said, Ahmed S; Warner, Brad W; Raval, Mehul V; Shakhsheer, Baddr",Pediatric critical care medicine,45,29

In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) published the ""WHO Consolidated Guideline on Self-Care Interventions for Health"" as a first installment in a planned series for various diseases (8). The first document focused on ""Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights"". Self-care including self-testing has the readily apparent benefits of privacy, confidentiality, speed, convenience, and access if the price is affordable. It is ""people-centered"" (9) and enables active participation in one's own health. It is also a health system approach as it can reduce burden on stretched systems with world-wide shortages in medical personnel or other barriers to health care access. Potential risks include: low specimen return rates, uncertain follow-up (linkage to care including treatment, repeat testing including test of cure, partner notification, counseling on risk reduction), unintended/unnecessary use (resulting in false positives with their own set of associated problems), incorrect use, lack of understanding of window periods (resulting in false negatives), lack of surveillance data generation, among other issues (9). The WHO systematically reviewed evidence for self-testing or specimen self-collection for GC, CT and syphilis, including US studies, and published a meta-analysis of available evidence (9). Programs offering self-collection of samples increased overall uptake of STI testing services (RR: 2.941, 95% CI 1.188 to 7.281) and case finding (RR: 2.166, 95% CI1.043 to 4.498), prior to the pandemic (9). U. S. laboratory research on the equivalence and/or superiority of self-collected versus provider-collected specimens for test sensitivity was reported by Gaydos et al (summarized or referenced in (10)). Based on this evidence, WHO issued a new recommendation in 2019 ""Self-collection of samples for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis should be made available as an additional approach to deliver STI testing services for individuals using STI testing services"" (8). In addition, WHO issued a new and conditional recommendation: ""Self-collection of samples for Treponema pallidum (syphilis) and Trichomonas vaginalis may be considered as an additional approach to deliver STI testing services for Individuals using STI testing services"" (8).

Existing surveillance systems are generally not based on population samples and are not longitudinal in design. METHODS: Samples were collected from individuals aged 2 years and older living in private households in England that were randomly selected from address lists and previous Office for National Statistics surveys in repeated cross-sectional household surveys with additional serial sampling and longitudinal follow-up. Participants completed a questionnaire and did nose and throat self-swabs. The percentage of individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was estimated over time by use of dynamic multilevel regression and poststratification, to account for potential residual non-representativeness. Potential changes in risk factors for testing positive over time were also assessed. The study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN21086382. FINDINGS: Between April 26 and Nov 1, 2020, results were available from 1â191â170 samples from 280â327 individuals; 5231 samples were positive overall, from 3923 individuals. The percentage of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 changed substantially over time, with an initial decrease between April 26 and June 28, 2020, from 0·40% (95% credible interval 0·29-0·54) to 0·06% (0·04-0·07), followed by low levels during July and August, 2020, before substantial increases at the end of August, 2020, with percentages testing positive above 1% from the end of October, 2020. Having a patient-facing role and working outside your home were important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the end of the first wave (April 26 to June 28, 2020), but not in the second wave (from the end of August to Nov 1, 2020). Age (young adults, particularly those aged 17-24 years) was an important initial driver of increased positivity rates in the second wave. For example, the estimated percentage of individuals testing positive was more than six times higher in those aged 17-24 years than in those aged 70 years or older at the end of September, 2020. A substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms around their positive test (45-68%, dependent on calendar time. INTERPRETATION: Important risk factors for testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 varied substantially between the part of the first wave that was captured by the study (April to June, 2020) and the first part of the second wave of increased positivity rates (end of August to Nov 1, 2020), and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the COVID-19 pandemic moving forwards.

An anonymous online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 2,254 full-time doctors/nurses in three Chinese provinces during 10/2020-11/2020. The prevalence of BICV was 75.1%/68.0% among nurses/doctors under the most optimum scenario of this study (free/80% effectiveness/rare mild side effects); it dropped to 64.6%/56.5% if it costed 600 Yuan (USD90). Similar prevalence was obtained (72.7%/71.2%) if the vaccination was recommended by the government/hospitals but dropped to <50% if effectiveness was 50% or mild side effects were common; 13.0% preferred to take up COVID-19 vaccination at the soonest (81.8% would wait and see). Scientific proof (completion of phase III clinical trials and approval from health authorities) was rated the highest in its impacts on vaccination decision, followed by vaccines' performance, and then logistics. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that perceived severity, perceived barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy (but neither perceived susceptibility nor perceived barriers) were significantly associated with the two BICV outcomes. The coverage of COVID-19 vaccination would be high only if the vaccines perform well.

Previous studies have suggested a role for endothelial cell injury in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. To determine whether endotheliopathy is involved in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy pathogenesis, we assessed markers of endothelial cell and platelet activation in critically and non-critically ill patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: In this single-centre cross-sectional study, hospitalised adult (&#8805;18 years) patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were identified in the medical intensive care unit (ICU) or a specialised non-ICU COVID-19 floor in our hospital. Asymptomatic, non-hospitalised controls were recruited as a comparator group for biomarkers that did not have a reference range. We assessed markers of endothelial cell and platelet activation, including von Willebrand Factor (VWF) antigen, soluble thrombomodulin, soluble P-selectin, and soluble CD40 ligand, as well as coagulation factors, endogenous anticoagulants, and fibrinolytic enzymes. We compared the level of each marker in ICU patients, non-ICU patients, and controls, where applicable. We assessed correlations between these laboratory results with clinical outcomes, including hospital discharge and mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to further explore the association between biochemical markers and survival. FINDINGS: 68 patients with COVID-19 were included in the study from April 13 to April 24, 2020, including 48 ICU and 20 non-ICU patients, as well as 13 non-hospitalised, asymptomatic controls. Markers of endothelial cell and platelet activation were significantly elevated in ICU patients compared with non-ICU patients, including VWF antigen (mean 565% [SD 199] in ICU patients vs 278% [133] in non-ICU patients; p<0·0001) and soluble P-selectin (15·9 ng/mL [4·8] vs 11·2 ng/mL [3·1]; p=0·0014). VWF antigen concentrations were also elevated above the normal range in 16 (80%) of 20 non-ICU patients. We found mortality to be significantly correlated with VWF antigen (râ=â0·38; p=0·0022) and soluble thrombomodulin (râ=â0·38; p=0·0078) among all patients. In all patients, soluble thrombomodulin concentrations greater than 3·26 ng/mL were associated with lower rates of hospital discharge (22 [88%] of 25 patients with low concentrations vs 13 [52%] of 25 patients with high concentrations; p=0·0050) and lower likelihood of survival on Kaplan-Meier analysis (hazard ratio 5·9, 95% CI 1·9-18·4; p=0·0087). INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that endotheliopathy is present in COVID-19 and is likely to be associated with critical illness and death. Early identification of endotheliopathy and strategies to mitigate its progression might improve outcomes in COVID-19.

Direct detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acids in respiratory tract specimens informs patient, healthcare institution and public health level decision-making. The numbers of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection tests are rapidly increasing, as is the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recognized a significant need for frequently updated systematic reviews of the literature to inform evidence-based best practice guidance. OBJECTIVE: The IDSA's goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assists clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests. In addition, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test performance, discuss the nuance of test result interpretation in a variety of practice settings, and highlight important unmet research needs in the COVID-19 diagnostic testing space. METHODS: IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 15 diagnostic recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Universal access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention and the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on the clinical performance of available tests is rapidly emerging, but the quality of evidence of the current literature is considered low to very low. Recognizing these limitations, the IDSA panel weighed available diagnostic evidence and recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19. In addition, testing is recommended for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected contact with a COVID-19 case. Testing asymptomatic individuals without known exposure is suggested when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage decisions, dictate eligibility for surgery, or inform administration of immunosuppressive therapy. Ultimately, prioritization of testing will depend on institutional-specific resources and the needs of different patient populations.","Hanson, Kimberly E; Caliendo, Angela M; Arias, Cesar A; Englund, Janet A; Lee, Mark J; Loeb, Mark; Patel, Robin; El Alayli, Abdallah; Kalot, Mohamad A; Falck-Ytter, Yngve; Lavergne, Valery; Morgan, Rebecca L; Murad, M Hassan; Sultan, Shahnaz; Bhimraj, Adarsh; Mustafa, Reem A",Clin. infect. dis,45,1

The SCENARIO model is an example of a thermoregulatory model that predicts heat strain including body core temperature (Tc) from individual characteristics, physical activity, clothing properties and environmental conditions. This paper presents work to optimize and enhance the SCENARIO model for prediction of Tc during high intensity load carriage tasks under predominantly tropical climate conditions. Data for model optimization (in-sample analysis) and model external validation were derived from four and two load carriage studies respectively. A total of four parameters characterizing metabolic heat production, sweat evaporation and ice ingestion for hydration were identified for model optimization based on physiological reasoning. The accuracy of Tc estimates was evaluated based on bias, root mean square deviation (RMSD), RMSD based on mean values (RMSD-Mean), and standard deviation fall-in percentage (SDP). Under in-sample analysis, the optimized model achieved bias, RMSD, RMSD-Mean and SDP of 0.01°C, 0.39°C, 0.14°C and 99%, respectively. When externally validated against two sets of unseen data, the model achieved comparable bias, RMSD, RMSD-Mean and SDP values of 0.06°C, 0.32°C, 0.13°C, 92% and 0.08°C, 0.39°C, 0.19°C, 92%, respectively. Overall, the results indicate the robustness of the optimized SCENARIO model for predicting the Tc responses during prolonged, high-intensity physical tasks under hot and humid environments. Future work to further validate the model against data beyond the range of the present study's experimental data and enhancing it for more accurate simulations of other heat strain markers including heart rate is recommended.","Tan, Alvin Pengshi; Cheong, Chee Hoong; Lee, Tong; Seng, Kok Yong; Teo, Chiang Juay",Comput Biol Med,45,15

The present work aims to study the molecular -docking and dynamic of three pertinent medicinal plants i.e. Eurycoma harmandiana, Sophora flavescens and Andrographis paniculata phyto-compounds against SARS-COV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro) and main protease (Mpro)/3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro). The interaction of protein targets and ligands was performed through AutoDock-Vina visualized using PyMOL and BIOVIA-Discovery Studio 2020. Molecular docking with canthin-6-one 9-O-beta-glucopyranoside showed highest binding affinity and less binding energy with both PLpro and Mpro/3CLpro proteases and was subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations for a period of 100ns. Stability of the protein-ligand complexes was evaluated by different analyses. The binding free energy calculated using MM-PBSA and the results showed that the molecule must have stable interactions with the protein binding site. ADMET analysis of the compounds suggested that it is having drug-like properties like high gastrointestinal (GI) absorption, no blood-brain barrier permeability and high lipophilicity. The outcome revealed that canthin-6-one 9-O-beta-glucopyranoside can be used as a potential natural drug against COVID-19 protease.","Verma, Devvret Mitra Debasis Paul Manish Chaudhary Priya Kamboj Anshul Thatoi Hrudayanath Janmeda Pracheta Jain Divya Panneerselvam P.; Shrivastav, Rakesh Pant Kumud Das Mohapatra Pradeep K.",Current Research in Pharmacology and Drug Discovery,45,21

These measures included strict lockdowns, shutting down educational institutions, markets, shopping malls, airports and masjids. The study primarily aimed to assess the individuals' knowledge, attitude, behavioral practices to prevent coronavirus and its psychological impacts on their mental health but later researcher also conducted another post study. Factually, the economic crisis, holy month of Ramadan and Eid-ul-Fitar forced the authorities soften the lockdown. Consequently, after this relaxation, the patients of Covid-19 as well as the death rates increased exponentially in Punjab. Methods: A non-equivalent quasi-experimental research designed was used to conduct pre and post study. An online survey having standardized questions about the peoples' knowledge regarding Covid-19, attitudes, their behavioral practices to prevent it and in what manner covid effected their mental health was conducted. Moreover, it also includes the information for demographics of sample. The link was sent to the participants through email, WhatsApp, Social media, Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. Similarly, same procedure was followed in post-study, with the same participants, but after a gap of three weeks. Results: Data was analyzed by SPSS and t-test was applied to draw comparisons among the responses of pre and post study. Results revealed that peoples' knowledge and attitude towards Covid-19 remained same in both studies, however, their behavioral practices to prevent Covid-19 and psychological impacts on their mental health (i.e., stress, depression, fear) greatly reduced in post study as compared to the prestudy. Conclusion: The authorities should initiate the health education programs to improve the knowledge, attitude and behavioral practices regarding Covid-19 and to combat its psychological impact on mental health. Besides, it is highly recommended that authorities should take bold steps to enforce formal, or smart lockdown to take control over the situation or else get ready to filled up the graveyards. The situation can also be controlled by enforcing precautionary measures and re-inviting awareness.","Naz, B.; Fida, M. K.; Khan, M. Z.; Safdar, A.; Asghar, M.

Here, we report that mice immunized with RBD219-N1/Alhydrogel® were fully protected from lethal SARS-CoV challenge (0% mortality), compared to ~30% mortality in mice immunized with the SARS S protein formulated with Alhydrogel®, and 100% mortality in negative controls. An RBD219-N1 formulation with Alhydrogel® was also superior to the S protein, unadjuvanted RBD, and AddaVax (MF59-like adjuvant)-formulated RBD in inducing specific antibodies and preventing cellular infiltrates in the lungs upon SARS-CoV challenge. Specifically, a formulation with a 1:25 ratio of RBD219-N1 to Alhydrogel® provided high neutralizing antibody titers, 100% protection with non-detectable viral loads with minimal or no eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates.

Further, maxillary expansion has been associated with nasal airway resistance alterations. This study aimed to investigate whether there is a correlation between skeletal features and nasal airflow- and olfaction-related problems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 68 patients (30 boys, 38 girls; mean age 9 ± 2 years) examined at the Ohu University Hospital. We classified patients into three skeletal Classes (Class I, II, and III) based on the ANB angle. Olfactory disorder history was collected from the guardians. Maxillofacial measurements, nasal airflow assessments, and olfactory tests were performed using cephalometric analysis, rhinomanometry, and T&T olfactometer, respectively. RESULTS: Malocclusion, resulting from skeletal mandibular protrusion and smaller maxilla, was associated with reduced olfaction in children. The detection and recognition thresholds of skeletal Class III were significantly higher than those of Classes I (p = .01) and II (p = .01). Significant correlations were observed between SNA and the detection threshold (r = -.50) as well as between nasion perpendicular-point A and the recognition threshold (r = -.53). The detection and recognition thresholds were significantly higher in Class III than in Classes I (r = .3) and II (r = -.1). CONCLUSIONS: Maxillary growth and development may be associated with olfaction in children. Changing the maxillofacial morphology may improve olfactory function. In the future, we will investigate how malocclusion treatment affects olfactory function.","Oka, Shiori; Kawanabe, Hitoshi; Yamanobe, Shinya; Fukui, Kazunori; Baba, Yuh; Deguchi, Toru",,45,1

This contributed to a virtual cessation of elective surgery during the pandemic surge. To inform evidence-based guidance on the decisions for surgery during the recovery phase of the pandemic, we compare 30-day outcomes in patients testing positive for COVID-19 before their operation, to contemporary propensity-matched COVID-19 negative patients undergoing the same procedures. METHODS: This prospective multicentre study included all patients undergoing surgery at 170 Veterans Health Administration (VA) hospitals across the United States. COVID-19 positive patients were propensity matched to COVID-19 negative patients on demographic and procedural factors. We compared 30-day outcomes between COVID-19 positive and negative patients, and the effect of time from testing positive to the date of procedure (&#8804;10 days, 11-30 days and >30 days) on outcomes. RESULTS: Between March 1 and August 15, 2020, 449 COVID-19 positive and 51,238 negative patients met inclusion criteria. Propensity matching yielded 432 COVID-19 positive and 1256 negative patients among whom half underwent elective surgery. Infected patients had longer hospital stays (median seven days), higher rates of pneumonia (20.6%), ventilator requirement (7.6%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 17.1%), septic shock (13.7%), and ischemic stroke (5.8%), while mortality, reoperations and readmissions were not significantly different. Higher odds for ventilation and stroke persisted even when surgery was delayed 11-30 days, and for pneumonia, ARDS, and septic shock >30 days after a positive test. DISCUSSION: 30-day pulmonary, septic, and ischaemic complications are increased in COVID-19 positive, compared to propensity score matched negative patients. Odds for several complications persist despite a delay beyond ten days after testing positive. Individualized risk-stratification by pulmonary and atherosclerotic comorbidities should be considered when making decisions for delaying surgery in infected patients.","Lal, Brajesh K; Prasad, Nikhil K; Englum, Brian R; Turner, Douglas J; Siddiqui, Tariq; Carlin, Minerva Mayorga; Lake, Rachel; Sorkin, John D",Am. j. surg,45,1

In a fast-evolving pandemic, evidence-based studies are lacking in many areas. This paper presents European Academy of Neurology (EAN) expert consensus statements to guide neurologists caring for patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A refined Delphi methodology was applied. In round 1, statements were provided by EAN scientific panels (SPs). In round 2, these statements were circulated to SP members not involved in writing them, asking for agreement/disagreement. Items with agreement >70% were retained for round 3, in which SP co-chairs rated importance on a five-point Likert scale. Results were graded by importance and reported as consensus statements. RESULTS: In round one, 70 statements were provided by 23 SPs. In round two, 259/1061 SP member responses were received. Fifty-nine statements obtained >70% agreement and were retained. In round three, responses were received from 55 co-chairs of 29 SPs. Whilst general recommendations related to prevention of COVID-19 transmission had high levels of agreement and importance, opinion was more varied concerning statements related to therapy. CONCLUSION: This is the first structured consensus statement on good clinical practice in patients with neurological disease during the COVID-19 pandemic that provides immediate guidance for neurologists.

A wide variety of treatment options are being considered for COVID-19, but there is still no definitive treatment or vaccine. This review aims to explain the background of the convalescent plasma treatment and its relations with COVID-19 immunity, to define the ideal treatment procedures and to reveal present and future perspectives in the light of rapidly growing data. Immunological basis of COVID-19 associated immune response and convalescent plasma as a treatment option: Since it has been shown that the impaired immune response of the host is one of the most important factors that increase the severity of the infection, treatment strategies to suppress aberrant immune activation are being dwelled on. Convalescent/immune plasma, which is derived from recently recovered patients and contains neutralizing antibodies and many other immune-modulatory substances, seems to be the most convenient strategy to restore normal immune function considering the fast-spreading nature of the ongoing pandemic. Conclusion and future perspectives: Even though mechanisms of action of plasma therapy are not fully delineated, it has been shown that it could lead to a reduction in mortality since other alternatives such as monoclonal antibodies or SARS-CoV-2 hyper immunoglobulin require much more time and effort to be developed.","Sayinalp, BaSak; Çinar, Olgu ErkIn; HaznedaroGlu, IbrahIm CelalettIn",,45,16

We overturned the concept by demonstrating that H2 exhibits antioxidant effects and protects cells against oxidative stress. Subsequently, it has been revealed that H2 has multiple functions in addition to antioxidant effects, including ant-inflammatory, anti-allergic functions, and as a cell death and autophagy regulation. Additionally, H2 stimulates energy metabolism. Because H2 does not readily react with most biomolecules without a catalyst, it is essential to identify the primary targets with which H2 reacts or interacts directly. As a first event, H2 may react directly with strong oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals (â¢OH) in vivo. This review addresses the key issues related to this in vivo reaction. â¢OH may have a physiological role because it triggers a free radical chain reaction and may be involved in the regulation of Ca2+ - or mitochondrial ATP-dependent K+ - channeling. In the subsequent pathway, H2 suppressed a free radical chain reaction, leading to decreases in lipid peroxide and its end products. Derived from the peroxides, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal functions as a mediator that up-regulates multiple functional PGC-1&#945;. As the other direct target in vitro and in vivo, H2 intervenes in the free radical chain reaction to modify oxidized phospholipids, which may act as an antagonist of Ca2+ -channels. The resulting suppression of Ca2+ - signaling inactivates multiple functional NFAT and CREB transcription factors, which may explain H2 multifunctionality. This review also addresses the involvement of NFAT in the beneficial role of H2 in COVID-19, Alzheimer's disease and advanced cancer. We discuss some unsolved issues of H2 action on lipopolysaccharide signaling, MAPK and NF-&#954;B pathways and the Nrf2 paradox. Finally, as a novel idea for the direct targeting of H2 , this review introduces the possibility that H2 causes structural changes in proteins via hydrate water changes.","Ohta, Shigeo",Curr. pharm. des,45,14

Prior studies have not examined the association of medication dose with risks. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included people aged &#8805;18 years enrolled in a US integrated healthcare system for at least 4 months as of 2/29/2020. Current ACEI and ARB use was identified from pharmacy data, and the estimated daily dose was calculated and standardized across medications. COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations were identified through 6/14/2020 from laboratory and hospitalization data. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals, adjusting for race/ethnicity, obesity and other covariates. RESULTS: Among 322,044 individuals, 826 developed COVID-19 infection. Among people using ACEI/ARBs, 204/56,105 developed COVID-19 (3.6 per 1000 individuals) compared with 622/265,939 without ACEI/ARB use (2.3 per 1000), yielding an adjusted OR of 0.91 (95% CI 0.74-1.12). For use of < 1 defined daily dose vs. nonuse, the adjusted OR for infection was 0.92 (95% CI 0.66-1.28); for 1 to < 2 defined daily doses, 0.89 (95% CI 0.66-1.19); and for &#8805;2 defined daily doses, 0.92 (95% CI 0.72-1.18). The OR was similar for ACEIs and ARBs and in subgroups by age and sex. 26% of people with COVID-19 infection were hospitalized; the adjusted OR for hospitalization in relation to ACEI/ARB use was 0.98 (95% CI 0.63-1.54), and there was no association with dose.

In the operating room, this potentially exposes personnel to aerosolized viruses as well as carcinogens. In light of circumstances surrounding COVID-19 and a concern for the safety of healthcare professionals, our study seeks to quantify the volumes of gas leaked from dynamic interactions between laparoscopic instruments and the trocar port to better understand potential exposure to surgically aerosolized particles. METHODS: A custom setup was constructed to simulate an insufflated laparoscopic surgical cavity. Two surgical instrument use scenarios were examined to observe and quantify opportunities for insufflation gas leakage. Both scenarios considered multiple configurations of instrument and trocar port sizes/dimensions: (1) the full insertion and full removal of a laparoscopic instrument from the port and (2) the movement of the scope within the port, recognized as ""dynamic interaction"", which occurs nearly 100% of the time over the course of any procedure. RESULTS: For a 5 mm instrument in a 5 mm trocar, the average volume of gas leaked during dynamic interaction and full insertion/removal scenarios were 43.67 and 25.97 mL of gas, respectively. Volume of gas leaked for a 5 mm instrument in a 12 mm port averaged 41.32 mL and 29.47 for dynamic interaction vs. instrument insertion and removal. Similar patterns were shown with a 10 mm instrument in 12 mm port, with 55.68 mL for the dynamic interaction and 58.59 for the instrument insertion/removal. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic interactions and insertion/removal events between laparoscopic instruments and ports appear to contribute to consistent leakage of insufflated gas into the OR. Any measures possible taken to reduce OR gas leakage should be considered in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Minimizing laparoscope and instrument removal and replacement would be one strategy to mitigate gas leakage during laparoscopic surgery.","Uecker, John M; Fagerberg, Austin; Ahmad, Naser; Cohen, Alexander; Gilkey, Mitchell; Alembeigi, Farshid; Idelson, Christopher R",Surg. endosc,45,16

However, in the context of a pandemic with a highly transmissible coronavirus, implementation of nutrition practice may be difficult. A multicenter electronic survey involving 62 dieticians was conducted, in order to understand barriers associated with dieticians' adherence to nutrition guidelines for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Indonesia. 69% of dieticians felt under stress when performing nutrition care, and 90% took supplements to boost their own immunity against the coronavirus. The concerns related to clinical practice included a lack of clear guidelines (74%), a lack of access to medical records (55%), inadequate experience or knowledge (48%), and a lack of self-efficacy/confidence (29%) in performing nutritional care. Half (52%) of the dieticians had performed nutrition education/counseling, 47% had monitored a patient's body weight, and 76% had monitored a patient's dietary intake. An adjusted linear regression showed that guideline adherence independently predicted the dieticians' nutrition care behaviors of nutrition counselling (ß: 0.24 (0.002, 0.08); p = 0.04), and monitoring of body weight (ß: 0.43 (0.04, 0.11); p = 0.001) and dietary intake (ß: 0.47(0.03, 0.10); p = 0.001) of COVID-19 patients.

Abnormally high prices have been reported at retail outlets and meat packers have been accused of unfair business practices because of widening price spreads. Processing facilities have experienced COVID-19 outbreaks resulting in shutdowns. Using weekly data on wholesale and retail prices of beef, pork, and poultry, we characterize the time series behavior and dynamic linkages of U.S. meat prices before the COVID-19 pandemic. We model vertical price transmission using both linear and threshold autoregressive (AR) models and vector error correction (VEC) models. With the estimated models, we then compare price movements under COVID-19 to model predictions. All three meat markets are well-integrated and we observe unexpected, large price movements in April and May of 2020. Early COVID-19 related shocks appear to be transitory with prices returning to expected levels at a pace consistent with the speed of transmission prior to the pandemic.

The copper acetate salt was added into the PIL nanoparticle dispersion and in situ reduced into copper nanoparticles anchoring onto the PIL nanoparticles. Despite being waterborne, the PIL in bulk is intrinsically insoluble in water and the formed coating is stable in water. The formed surface coating by PIL/copper composite nanoparticles was able to deactivate SARS-CoV-2 virions by 90.0% in 30 minutes and thus may effectively prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through surface contact.

Some of these measures can adversely affect mental health. Activities that can be performed at home may mitigate these consequences and improve overall mental well-being. In this study, home-based activities that have potential beneficial effects on mental health were examined. METHODS: A rapid review was conducted based on a search of the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PyscINFO, Global Health, epistemonikos.org, covid19reviews.org, and eppi.ioe.ac.uk/covid19_map_v13.html. Eligible studies include randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies published between 1/1/2000 and 28/05/2020 and that examined the impact of various activities on mental health outcomes in low-resource settings and contexts that lead to social isolation. Studies of activities that require mental health professionals or that could not be done at home were excluded. Two review authors performed title/abstract screening. At the full-text review stage, 25% of the potentially eligible studies were reviewed in full by two review authors; the rest were reviewed by one review author. Risk of bias assessment and data extraction were performed by one review author and checked by a second review author. The main outcome assessed was change or differences in mental health as expressed in Cohen's d; analysis was conducted following the synthesis without meta-analysis guidelines (SWiM). PROSPERO registration: CRD42020186082. RESULTS: Of 1,236 unique records identified, 160 were reviewed in full, resulting in 16 included studies. The included studies reported on the beneficial effects of exercise, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, and listening to relaxing music. One study reported on the association between solitary religious activities and post traumatic stress disorder symptoms. While most of the included studies examined activities in group settings, particularly among individuals in prisons, the activities were described as something that can be performed at home and alone. All included studies were assessed to be at risk of bias in one or more of the bias domains examined. CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that certain home-based activities can promote mental wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Guidelines are needed to help optimize benefits while minimizing potential risks when performing these activities.","Puyat, Joseph H; Ahmad, Haroon; Avina-Galindo, Ana Michelle; Kazanjian, Arminee; Gupta, Aanchel; Ellis, Ursula; Ashe, Maureen C; Vila-Rodriguez, Fidel; Halli, Priyanka; Salmon, Amy; Vigo, Daniel; Almeida, Alberto; De Bono, Christopher E",PLoS One,45,24

However, research providing a comprehensive and triangulated stakeholder perspective of perceived harms is lacking. How are adolescent online harms experienced and conceptualized by students, parents, and teachers? The present study comprised part of a qualitative needs assessment investigation with the use of focus groups and individual interviews among key stakeholder groups assessing perceived impacts with a focus on the negative consequences and perceived harms. The study’s sample consisted of students (N = 42, M(age) = 13.5, SD = 2.3), parents (N = 9, M(age) = 37, SD = 5.6) and teachers (N = 9, M(age) = 34, SD = 4.9) from the UK. Data were analysed with thematic analysis. Findings focused primarily on social media use impacts and indicated that processes underlying impacts experienced by adolescents may be conceptualized on a severity continuum. Stakeholder consensus on perceptions of challenges and perceived harms formed the second theme, with impacts further analysed as relating to time displacement, peer judgement, sensory overload and context of the adolescent with functional (performance, task switching, use of multiple devices), cognitive (loss or deterioration of attentional focus, attention deficit), and emotional consequences (stress, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive/checking behaviours). A third theme formed was individual vulnerabilities predisposing poor mental health outcomes. The final theme related to impacts dependent on context and meaning attached. Findings suggest a consideration of a spectrum approach encompassing a broader range of potential psychological challenges and perceived harms beyond safety concerns and addiction in understanding problematic adolescent online experiences. Understanding perceived harms can aid the objective setting of interventions and consideration of mental health literacy in school curricula.","Throuvala, Melina A.; Griffiths, Mark D.; Rennoldson, Mike; Kuss, Daria J.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,45,17

They pose an unpleasant experience for patients and a therapeutic challenge for clinicians. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterise the specific experiences of patients affected by the qualitative symptoms of parosmia and phantosmia including both triggers for symptoms and self-help measures they have tried. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey questionnaire was developed with the input of patient experts within the charity Fifth Sense. The survey was then open online for 3 months to charity members complaining of qualitative symptoms. The survey captured the frequency and impact of symptoms and self-management undertaken. Reflective feedback was also captured from a patient workshop. RESULTS: There were 100 participants; 61% female, age range 13-88. Common self-reported aetiology included sinonasal disease (17%), idiopathic (33%) and post-viral olfactory loss (26%) and post-traumatic olfactory loss (23%). Parosmia was reported as a daily symptom in 67% compared to 31% for phantosmia; 36% complained of suffering with both symptoms. Only 4% of respondents reported having received any successful treatment for their qualitative symptoms and 58% reported having received no treatment whatsoever. Olfactory training was the most common self-management method reported. CONCLUSION: This study illustrates that qualitative disturbances remain problematic for those who experience them due to the duration of symptoms, the relative lack of experience or knowledge amongst medical professionals and the lack of therapeutic options. In future, consideration needs to be given to adaptation and coping strategies to help patients deal with these symptoms.","Philpott, Carl; Dixon, Joanne; Boak, Duncan",Allergy Rhinol (Providence),45,17

Within approximately 30 days, the total number of confirmed cases climbed up to 1, 000, accompanied by a doubling period of less than 3 days. About one week later, after this number exceeded 4, 000 cases, and following some extreme lockdown measures taken by the Israeli government, the daily infection rate started a sharp decrease from the peak value of 1, 131 down to slightly more than 100 new confirmed cases on April 30. Motivated by this encouraging data, similar to the trends observed in many other countries, along with the growing economic pressures, the Israeli government has quickly lifted most of its emergency regulations. Throughout May, the daily number of new cases stayed at a very low level of 20–40 until at the end of May it started a steady increase, exceeding 1, 000 by the end of June and 2, 000 on July 22. As suggested by some experts and popular media, this disturbing trend may be even a part of a “second wave”. This article attempts to analyze the data available on Israel at the end of July 2020, compared to three European countries (Greece, Italy, and Sweden), in order to understand the local dynamics of COVID-19, assess the effect of the implemented intervention measures, and discuss some plausible scenarios for the foreseeable future.","Last, Mark",PLoS One,45,1

Therefore, predicting the number of deaths from the new coronavirus is an urgent task. The aim of the study is to analyze the factors affecting COVID-19 mortality rate in various countries, to predict direct and indirect victims of the pandemic in the Russian Federation, and to estimate additional mortality during the pandemic based on the demographic data. The main research method is econometric modeling. Comparison of various data was also applied. The authors' calculations were based on data from the RSSS, the World Bank, as well as specialized sites with coronavirus statistics in Russia and in the world. A predictive estimation of the deceased number of people due to the pandemic in Russia was made. It is confirmed that the deaths proportion of the completed cases of the disease depends on the level of testing. It is shown that the revealed mortality of the disease depends on the proportion of completed cases, on the population age structure, and on how early the pandemic entered the country compared to the other countries. It is determined that the number of additional deaths due to the coronavirus is approximately 31 thousand people. The analysis revealed that the relatively low proportion of COVID in Russia is the result of a special approach to the cause of death determination. The mortality rate in Russia in April 2020 was about 3% higher than in April 2019. The share of the deceased health workers in the total coronavirus mortality in the Russian Federation is higher than in the developed countries, which indicates an underestimation of the data on COVID- 19 deaths in the Russian Federation, and the unsatisfactory quality of the Russian healthcare system. The number of direct and indirect victims of the pandemic in the Russian Federation at the end of July was approximately 43 thousand people.","Lifshits, M.; Neklyudova, N.",,45,1

A postal questionnaire survey was conducted to explore the self-perceived pandemic preparedness of GPs in the West Midlands, United Kingdom, and to determine differences between urban and non-urban GPs. The postal questionnaire was sent out to 773 GPs in November 2005, and a reminder was sent in January 2006. In all, 427/773 (55%) questionnaires were returned, and 56% of respondents were aware of influenza pandemic preparedness plans. Approximately one-quarter of respondents (28%, 114/401) thought the response of their practice to a pandemic event would be very poor/poor. Non-urban GPs were significantly more likely to rate the response of their practice to a pandemic as likely to be poor (OR 3.01, 95%CI 1.03–8.76) and were less likely to be aware of pandemic preparedness plans (OR 0.62, 95%CI 0.39–0.99). Non-urban GPs were also significantly more likely to feel less confident in their ability to explain to their patients what to do and why during an influenza pandemic than GPs based in urban areas (OR 4.68, 95%CI 1.78–12.31). GPs rating of the odds of a pandemic affecting the United Kingdom did not differ significantly by geographic location. The results of this paper can be used to inform and influence public health policy and as evidence of a need to provide additional education and training to improve pandemic preparedness among GPs, in particular those in non-urban areas.","Beaumont, M.; Duggal, H.

Given the global prevalence of diabetes, affecting over 450 million people worldwide and still on the rise, the emerging COVID-19 crisis poses a serious threat to an extremely large vulnerable population. However, the broad heterogeneity and complexity of this dysmetabolic condition, with reference to etiologic mechanisms, degree of glycemic derangement and comorbid associations, along with the extensive sexual dimorphism in immune responses, can hamper any patient generalization. Even more relevant, and irrespective of glucose-lowering activities, DPP4 inhibitors and GLP1 receptor agonists may have a favorable impact on the modulation of viral entry and overproduction of inflammatory cytokines during COVID-19 infection, although current evidence is limited and not univocal. Conversely, SGLT2 inhibitors may increase the likelihood of COVID-19-related ketoacidosis decompensation among patients with severe insulin deficiency.

Because empathy is considered an important value for clinicians and may even be associated with better patient outcomes, we assessed the empathy of orthopaedic surgery trainees and identified factors associated with empathy. METHODS: Between June and September 2020, an anonymous survey was distributed electronically to trainees in 23 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited orthopaedic surgery residency programs via the Collaborative Orthopaedic Educational Research Group. The survey comprised the validated Short-Form 8-Item Empathy Quotient (EQ-8) questionnaire—scored on a scale of 0, least empathetic, to 16, most empathetic—and single-item measure of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization derived from the Maslach Burnout Index—scored using a frequency scale. In total, 438 of 605 (72%) trainees completed the survey. The scores were compared via one-way analysis of variance, with Bonferroni correction and Tukey post-hoc testing, α = 0.05. RESULTS: The mean (±SD) EQ-8 score among respondents was 11.3 ± 3.3. Women scored significantly higher (mean, 12.2 ± 2.8) than men (mean, 11.2 ± 3.3) (p = 0.02). Mean scores were significantly higher for trainees planning on a career in academic medicine (12.0 ± 2.9) than those intending to pursue private practice (10.9 ± 3.3) or those with a military commitment (10.4 ± 3.4) (p = 0.01). An inverse relationship was found between EQ-8 scores and single-item Maslach Burnout Index measures in depersonalization and emotional exhaustion (both, p < 0.01). No significant differences were found in EQ-8 scores across postgraduate year, program location, primary training setting, intended fellowship, relationship status, or whether they reported having children. CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between postgraduate year and EQ-8 score. Women and those intending to pursue a career in academic medicine had significantly higher levels of empathy. A significant inverse relationship was found between burnout and empathy. Respondents with higher levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization had lower levels of empathy.","Sabharwal, Samir; Lin, Carol; Weistroffer, Joseph K.; LaPorte, Dawn M.",JB JS Open Access,45,11

Understanding of the mechanisms by which CD8TRM achieve effective immune protection remains incomplete in a naturally recurring human disease. Using laser capture microdissection and transcriptional profiling, we investigate the impact of CD8TRM on the tissue microenvironment in skin biopsies sequentially obtained from a clinical cohort of diverse disease expression during herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) reactivation. Epithelial cells neighboring CD8TRM display elevated and widespread innate and cell-intrinsic antiviral signature expression, largely related to IFNG expression. Detailed evaluation via T-cell receptor reconstruction confirms that CD8TRM recognize viral-infected cells at the specific HSV-2 peptide/HLA level. The hierarchical pattern of core IFN-γ signature expression is well-conserved in normal human skin across various anatomic sites, while elevation of IFI16, TRIM 22, IFITM2, IFITM3, MX1, MX2, STAT1, IRF7, ISG15, IFI44, CXCL10 and CCL5 expression is associated with HSV-2-affected asymptomatic tissue. In primary human cells, IFN-γ pretreatment reduces gene transcription at the immediate-early stage of virus lifecycle, enhances IFI16 restriction of wild-type HSV-2 replication and renders favorable kinetics for host protection. Thus, the adaptive immune response through antigen-specific recognition instructs innate and cell-intrinsic antiviral machinery to control herpes reactivation, a reversal of the canonical thinking of innate activating adaptive immunity in primary infection. Communication from CD8TRM to surrounding epithelial cells to activate broad innate resistance might be critical in restraining various viral diseases.","Peng, Tao; Phasouk, Khamsone; Sodroski, Catherine N.; Sun, Sijie; Hwangbo, Yon; Layton, Erik D.; Jin, Lei; Klock, Alexis; Diem, Kurt; Magaret, Amalia S.; Jing, Lichen; Laing, Kerry; Li, Alvason; Huang, Meei-Li; Mertens, Max; Johnston, Christine; Jerome, Keith R.; Koelle, David M.; Wald, Anna; Knipe, David M.; Corey, Lawrence; Zhu, Jia",Front Immunol,45,1

As MYLK coding SNPs are associated with severe inflammatory disorders (asthma, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)), we explored clinically relevant inflammatory stimuli and promoter SNPs in nmMLCK promoter regulation. Methods: Full-length or serially deleted MYLK luciferase reporter promoter activities were measured in human lung endothelial cells (ECs). SNP-containing non-muscle MYLK (nmMYLK) DNA fragments were generated and nmMYLK promoter binding by transcription factors (TFs) detected by protein–DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Promoter demethylation was evaluated by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza). A preclinical mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) was utilized for nmMLCK validation. Results: Lung EC levels of nmMLCK were significantly increased in LPS-challenged mice and LPS, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), 18% cyclic stretch (CS) and 5-Aza each significantly up-regulated EC nmMYLK promoter activities. EC exposure to FG-4592, a prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor that increases hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) expression, increased nmMYLK promoter activity, confirmed by HIF1α/HIF2α silencing. nmMYLK promoter deletion studies identified distal inhibitory and proximal enhancing promoter regions as well as mechanical stretch-, LPS- and TNFα-inducible regions. Insertion of ARDS-associated SNPs (rs2700408, rs11714297) significantly increased nmMYLK promoter activity via increased transcription binding (glial cells missing homolog 1 (GCM1) and intestine-specific homeobox (ISX), respectively). Finally, the MYLK rs78755744 SNP (−261G/A), residing within a nmMYLK CpG island, significantly attenuated 5-Aza-induced promoter activity. Conclusion: These findings indicate nmMYLK transcriptional regulation by clinically relevant inflammatory factors and ARDS-associated nmMYLK promoter variants are consistent with nmMLCK as a therapeutic target in severe inflammatory disorders.","Sun, Xiaoguang; Sun, Belinda L.; Sammani, Saad; Bermudez, Tadeo; Dudek, Steven M.; Camp, Sara M.; Garcia, Joe G.N.",Clin Sci (Lond),45,20

In 2001, a new respiratory pathogen called human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was identified in respiratory secretions. hMPV is an RNA virus of the Paramyxoviridae family, and it has been isolated on every continent and from individuals of all ages. hMPV causes 7 to 19% of all cases of ARTIs in both hospitalized and outpatient children, and the rate of detection in adults is approximately 3%. Symptoms of hMPV infection range from a mild cold to a severe disease requiring a ventilator and cardiovascular support. The main risk factors for severe disease upon hMPV infection are the presence of a high viral load, coinfection with other agents (especially human respiratory syncytial virus), being between 0 and 5 months old or older than 65 years, and immunodeficiency. Currently, available treatments for hMPV infections are only supportive, and antiviral drugs are employed in cases of severe disease as a last resort. Ribavirin and immunoglobulins have been used in some patients, but the real efficacy of these treatments is unclear. At present, the direction of research on therapy for hMPV infection is toward the development of new approaches, and a variety of vaccination strategies are being explored and tested in animal models.

However, exercise can be provided remotely as part of a home exercise programme, while support and advice can be provided over the telephone. There is initial evidence from trials and systematic reviews to suggest that remotely provided physiotherapy can be used to manage a variety of musculoskeletal conditions safely and effectively. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The aim of this single-blind randomised controlled non-inferiority trial is to determine whether a supported home exercise programme is as good as or better than face-to-face physiotherapy for the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions. Two hundred and ten participants will be recruited from five public hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Participants will be randomised to either the supported home exercise group or the face-to-face physiotherapy group. Participants allocated to the supported home exercise group will initially receive one face-to-face session with the trial physiotherapist and will then be managed remotely for the next 6 weeks. Participants allocated to the face-to-face physiotherapy group will receive a course of physiotherapy as typically provided in Sydney government hospitals. The primary outcome is function measured by the Patient Specific Functional Scale at 6 weeks. There will be nine secondary outcomes measured at 6 and 26 weeks. Separate analyses will be conducted on each outcome, and all analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. A health economic evaluation will be conducted from a health funder plus patient perspective.

Patients (n = 102) with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) were tested. The patients were asymptomatic (n = 2) or had mild (n = 37) or severe symptoms requiring hospitalization in a medical unit (n = 35) or intensive care unit (n = 28). Specificity was evaluated for 42 patients with previous viral and parasitic diseases as well as a high level of rheumatic factor. The sensitivity of OG was 95.8% (95% confidence interval [CI95%], 89.6 to 98.8) for samples collected ≥10 days after the onset of symptoms, which was equivalent to the sensitivity of ASIA of 90.5% (CI95%, 82.8 to 95.6). OG uncovered six false-negative results of ASIA, of which two had only IgM with OG. Specificity was 100% (CI95%, 93.4 to 100) with both tests on samples, including patients infected with endemic coronavirus. Overall, OG performance characteristics indicate that the test is suitable for routine use in clinical laboratories, and its performance is equivalent to that of immunoassay. Testing OG on a larger asymptomatic population may be needed to confirm these results.","Dellière, Sarah; Salmona, Maud; Minier, Marine; Gabassi, Audrey; Alanio, Alexandre; Le Goff, Jérôme; Delaugerre, Constance; Chaix, Marie-Laure",J Clin Microbiol,45,26

These enzymes are unique among the cascade enzymes for ubiquitin and other ubiquitin-like proteins in that all of them are induced by type I IFNs or other stimuli, such as exposure to viruses and lipopolysaccharide. Mass spectrometric analysis has led to the identification of several hundreds of candidate proteins that can be conjugated by ISG15. Some of them are type I IFN-induced proteins, such as PKR and RIG-I, and some are the key regulators that are involved in IFN signaling, such as JAK1 and STAT1, implicating the role of ISG15 and its conjugates in type I IFN-mediated innate immune responses. However, relatively little is known about the functional significance of ISG15 induction due to the lack of information on the consequences of its conjugation to target proteins. Here, we describe the recent progress made in exploring the biological function of ISG15 and its reversible modification of target proteins and thus in their implication in immune diseases.","Jeon, Young Joo; Yoo, Hee Min; Chung, Chin Ha",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis,45,21

A questionnaire was developed to identify risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection. Overall, the percentage of positive calves and farms was 38.8 and 68.2%, respectively. The SSU rRNA-based PCR identified two Cryptosporidium species, Cryptosporidium parvum (95.8%) and C. bovis (4.2%). Sequence analyses of the glycoprotein (gp60) gene revealed that all C. parvum isolates belonged to the subtype family IIa (IIaA15G2R1 and IIaA16G3R1), with the exception of three isolates that belonged to the subtype family IId (IIdA20G1b and IIdA20). Mixed logistic regression results indicated that calves aged 15–21 days were more likely to be Cryptosporidium-positive. The risk of being positive was also significantly higher in herds from Central Sardinia and in farms using non-slatted flooring. In addition, the application of disinfectants and milk replacers was significantly associated with higher Cryptosporidium prevalence. In contrast, the risk of being positive was significantly reduced in halofuginone-treated calves. Our results reveal that a significant percentage of suckling calves are carriers of zoonotic subtypes of C. parvum. Thus, both healthy and diarrhoeic calves younger than 1 month may represent a risk for the transmission of cryptosporidiosis in humans and animals.

We identified a novel MERS-CoV-related betacoronavirus, Hp-BatCoV HKU25, from Chinese pipistrelle bats. Although it is closely related to MERS-CoV in most genome regions, its spike protein occupies a phylogenetic position between that of Ty-BatCoV HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV HKU5. Because Ty-BatCoV HKU4 but not Pi-BatCoV HKU5 can use the MERS-CoV receptor human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) for cell entry, we tested the ability of Hp-BatCoV HKU25 to bind and use hDPP4. The HKU25-receptor binding domain (RBD) can bind to hDPP4 protein and hDPP4-expressing cells, but it does so with lower efficiency than that of MERS-RBD. Pseudovirus assays showed that HKU25-spike can use hDPP4 for entry to hDPP4-expressing cells, although with lower efficiency than that of MERS-spike and HKU4-spike. Our findings support a bat origin of MERS-CoV and suggest that bat CoV spike proteins may have evolved in a stepwise manner for binding to hDPP4.","Lau, Susanna K P; Zhang, Libiao; Luk, Hayes K H; Xiong, Lifeng; Peng, Xingwen; Li, Kenneth S M; He, Xiangyang; Zhao, Pyrear Su-Hui; Fan, Rachel Y Y; Wong, Antonio C P; Ahmed, Syed Shakeel; Cai, Jian-Piao; Chan, Jasper F W; Sun, Yinyan; Jin, Dongyan; Chen, Honglin; Lau, Terrence C K; Kok, Raven K H; Li, Wenhui; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Woo, Patrick C Y",J Infect Dis,45,24

In this article, we utilize critical theories and engage with colonial histories to contextualize Afrodiasporic experiences in Australia, arguing that the conditional acceptance of Black bodies within Australian spaces is contingent upon the status quo of the white hegemony. The tropes and discourses that render the bodies of Black African migrants simultaneously invisible and hyper-visible indicate that immigration is not only a movement of bodies, but also a phenomenon solidly tied to global inequality, power, and the abjection of blackness. Drawing on critical race perspectives and theories of belonging, we highlight through use of literature how Black Africans in Australia are constructed as ‘perpetual strangers’.

Methods: Between April and May 2020, a cross-sectional survey was performed at two tertiary hospitals in Daegu, South Korea, on patients' experiences, coping strategies and perceptions. Results: Most of the 544 patients participating in the survey strictly adhered to personal protection guidance against COVID-19. In the early COVID-19 crisis, many patients canceled or postponed hospital visits (57.5%) and rescheduled biologics administrations (26.4%). Although 13.6% utilized telemedicine, the frequency of individuals leaving their homes remained unchanged. Although 50.4% were concerned about their susceptibility to COVID-19, 72.2% adhered to their treatment for IBD. In patients taking biologics or Janus kinase inhibitors, 86.8% disagreed that they should discontinue their medication as a preventative measure against COVID- 19, but 21.9% actually discontinued their medications. Of those with discordance between the perception of IBD drug adherence and active behaviors, 5.4% of all and 39.4% of biologics or Janus kinase inhibitors withheld drugs specifically due to fear of COVID-19. Only 7% of all patients discussed drug safety with their physicians. The level of concern for COVID-19 depended on the type of drug used. Conclusions: Patients with IBD showed concerns about the increased risk of COVID-19 due to IBD or their medications, and a considerable number of patients withheld their medications without consulting medical staff. Enhanced active communications with patients with IBD and appropriate health-related education should be provided.","Lee, Yoo Jin; Kim, Kyeong Ok; Kim, Min Cheol; Cho, Kwang Bum; Park, Kyung Sik; Jang, Byeong Ik",Gut liver (Online),45,1

This is augmented by the stigma faced at home and society, owing to the nature of their job. AIM: To assess the mental health issues and stigma amongst health care workers involved in COVID care. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a hospital based cross sectional study where 150 health care workers involved in the care of COVID-19 patients, directly and indirectly, were selected using systematic random sampling. They were assessed using Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) Hindi Version, The Impact of Event Scale - Revised scale and a Modified Stigma scale. RESULTS: Significant psychological stress, anxiety, depression and high risk for developing post-traumatic stress disorder was found in more than half of the healthcare workers, albeit more in those having direct contact with COVID patients (p < 0.05). Stigma was significantly reported in most HCWs, especially with concerns regarding public attitude and disclosure of their work profile. CONCLUSION: Healthcare Workers are at a higher risk for developing psychological disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder because of the immensely stressful work-related conditions and stigma related to working with COVID patients. This may lead to long lasting psychosocial consequences which may affect more severely than the infection itself. Early identification of psychological issues of HCWs and timely intervention is the key.","Sachdeva, Ankur; Nandini, Harsh; Kumar, Vipin; Chawla, Rakesh K.; Chopra, Kamal",Indian J Tuberc,45,18

There are three types of cell-based reporter systems that express certain reporter protein for positive-sense single strand RNA virus infections. The first type is classical reporter system, which relies on recombinant virus, reporter virus particle, or subgenomic replicon. During infection with the recombinant virus or reporter virus particle, the reporter protein is expressed and can be detected in real time in a dose-dependent manner. Using subgenomic replicon, which are genetically engineered viral RNA molecules that are capable of replication but incapable of producing virions, the translation and replication of the replicon could be tracked by the accumulation of reporter protein. The second type of reporter system involves genetically engineered cells bearing virus-specific protease cleavage sequences, which can sense the incoming viral protease. The third type is based on viral replicase, which can report the specific virus infection via detection of the incoming viral replicase. This review specifically focuses on the major technical breakthroughs in the design of cell-based reporter systems and the application of these systems to the further understanding and control of viruses over the past few decades.","Ren, Linzhu; Peng, Zhiyuan; Chen, Xinrong; Ouyang, Hongsheng",Appl Biochem Biotechnol,45,1

Under the enormous pressure created by the pandemic, scientists are studying virus transmission mechanisms in order to develop effective mitigation strategies. However, no established methods have been developed to control the spread of this deadly virus. In addition, the ease in lockdown has escalated air pollution which may affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission through attachment to particulates. The present review summarizes the role of graphene nanomaterials, which show antimicrobial behavior and have antiviral efficacy, in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Graphene and its derivatives have excellent antimicrobial efficacy, providing both physical and chemical mechanisms of damage. Coupled with their lightness, optimal properties, and ease of functionalization, they are optimal nanomaterials for coating onto fabrics such as personal protection equipment, face masks and gloves to control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 effectively. Biosensors using graphene can effectively detect the virus with high accuracy and sensitivity, providing rapid quantification. It is envisioned that the present work will boost the development of graphene-based highly sensitive, accurate and cost-effective diagnostic tools for efficiently monitoring and controlling the spread of COVID-19 and other air-borne viruses.","Thakur, Amrit Kumar; Sathyamurthy, Ravishankar; Ramalingam, Velraj; Lynch, Iseult; Sharshir, Swellam Wafa; Ma, Zhenjun; Poongavanam, Ganeshkumar; Lee, Suyeong; Jeong, Yeseul; Hwang, Jang-Yeon",Environmental science.

Licensed therapeutic or vaccine products are not available to treat filovirus diseases. Candidate therapeutics previously shown to be efficacious in non-human primate disease models are based on virus-specific designs and have limited broad-spectrum antiviral potential. Here we show that BCX4430, a novel synthetic adenosine analogue, inhibits infection of distinct filoviruses in human cells. Biochemical, reporter-based and primer-extension assays indicate that BCX4430 inhibits viral RNA polymerase function, acting as a non-obligate RNA chain terminator. Post-exposure intramuscular administration of BCX4430 protects against Ebola virus and Marburg virus disease in rodent models. Most importantly, BCX4430 completely protects cynomolgus macaques from Marburg virus infection when administered as late as 48 hours after infection. In addition, BCX4430 exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against numerous viruses, including bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and flaviviruses. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of non-human primate protection from filovirus disease by a synthetic drug-like small molecule.

The vision among the project consortium, comprising both research and industrial partners, is that the new biomarker will be predictive of a range of age-related conditions, which may be preventable through personalized nutrition. We combine philosophical analysis and ethnographic fieldwork to explore the possibilities and challenges of managing aging through bodily signs that are not straightforwardly linked to symptomatic disease. We document how the improvement of measurement brings about new conceptual challenges of demarcating healthy and unhealthy states. Moreover, we highlight that the reframing of aging as risk has social and ethical implications, as it is generative of normative notions of what constitutes successful aging and good citizenship.","Green, Sara; Hillersdal, Line",Hist Philos Life Sci,45,16
624572,624572,624572,An Unexpected Positive Effect of Social Distancing Measures on the Care of Children With Autism in Vietnam,20.667564,1.7048882,2021,"COVID-19 is disproportionately impacting Black communities in the United States due to racial structures that increase exposure (e.g., densely populated areas, substandard housing, overrepresentation in essential work) and promote underlying diseases that exacerbate COVID-19. This manuscript uses Oath of a Pharmacist as a framework to propose a set of best practices for pharmacists to mitigate inequities such as achieve competence in the ideology of structural racism; identify systems of power that jeopardize Black health; value Black voices; name the socio-structural determinants of health; define race as a socio-political construction; name historical and contemporary racism; apply resources equitably based on need; collect robust data to solve complex problems; diminish bias and view patients holistically in the contexts of inequities; and advocate for Black lives. While race is biological fiction, Black individuals are at an increased risk for COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths than their white counterparts due to navigating generations of racist practices that often converge with other inequities—such as sexism, classism. To describe these racial health disparities, structured, racial disadvantage is commonly ignored while personal choices and clinical care are highlighted as the culprits. Achieving health equity requires comprehension, acceptance, and assessment of structural racism, and pharmacists are highly trusted, uniquely positioned healthcare professionals who, through their knowledge, skills, and resources, can help attenuate the effects of structural racism to support Black lives.","Avant, Nicole D.",Innov Pharm,45,26

Our objective was to better characterize how the impact of COVID-19 prevalence in the community affected public utilization of ED resources for non-COVID-19 encounters during the pandemic. Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study performed at a single urban quaternary care academic medical center with 95,000 annual visits in Los Angeles County (LAC). Weekly ED COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 (NC) volumes were abstracted from May 2, 2019 through April 24, 2021;other data parameters obtained included age (<18, 18-64, 65+), arrival mode (walk-in, ambulance), Emergency Severity Index (ESI), and ED disposition (discharge, admit/transfer, psych transfer, death). COVID-19 encounters were queried by any ED diagnosis of “COVID” or “coronavirus.” SARS-CoV-2 testing and vaccination data were obtained from LAC from March 10, 2020 through May 1, 2021. We calculated LAC SARS-CoV-2 testing positivity rates and cumulative vaccination rates per week and examined daily ED NC volumes in relation to LAC testing positivity rates and vaccination rates. Paired t-tests were conducted to compare ED NC volumes before and after the start of the pandemic. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to compare ED NC volumes to LAC testing positivity and vaccination rates. Results: ED NC volumes reduced by an average of 29% one year prior to and after March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic began;there was a significant difference in volume before (M=1803, SD 53) and after (M=1284, SD 214), t(51)=2.01, P=<.001. The week of April 3 had the largest relative volume decrease of 61% with state of emergency and stay-at-home orders issued in the preceding two weeks. NC volumes regained pre-pandemic levels by the week of April 10, 2021 and sustained through May 2021. On April 10, 2021 47% of the eligible population age 16 and over in LAC had received at least 1 COVID-19 vaccination dose. Figure 1 represents trend lines of ED NC volume over time in relation to LAC COVID test positivity rate and vaccination percentage. The age breakdown showed pediatric <18 NC volumes had the highest relative reduction, but this volume only accounted for 5% of ED NC visits in our study period. Age groups 18-64 and 65+ had NC relative reductions of 20% and 22% respectively. The ESI levels 1-5 breakdown showed similar distributions pre and post pandemic;ESI-4 had the largest relative decrease of 37% with ESI-2 and ESI-3 decreasing by 27% and 15% respectively. The arrival method of patients was largely unchanged with walk-ins accounting for 80% and 79% pre and post pandemic. ED NC admission rates increased from 38% to 43% with corresponding decrease in discharges;psychiatric transfers and deaths were unchanged. ED NC volume and LAC COVID test positivity rates were found to have a very strong negative correlation (r(113) = -0.88, p<.001). Conversely ED NC volumes and cumulative LAC 16+ vaccination rates had a very strong positive correlation (r(113) = 0.94, p<.001). Conclusions: The higher the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community, the more hesitant patients behaved in seeking ED care for non-COVID-19 reasons. Lower disease prevalence and increasing vaccination rates correlate with a return of NC volumes back to pre-pandemic levels.

This study examined the prevalence of PTSS and its association with quality of life (QOL) among COVID-19 survivors during the post-COVID-19 era in China. Methods: This was a comparative, cross-sectional study. PTSS, depressive symptoms, and QOL were assessed with standardized instruments. Results: A total of 134 COVID-19 survivors and 214 non-infected controls (healthy controls hereafter) were recruited. Among COVID-19 survivors, the PTSS prevalence was 18.66% (95%CI: 11.98–25.34%), which was significantly higher than that (5.61%, 95%CI: 2.50–8.71%) of healthy controls (P < 0.001). After controlling for covariates, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed that COVID-19 survivors had a higher PTSS total score than did healthy controls [F((1,348)) = 4.664, P = 0.032]. A separate ANCOVA revealed there were no significant differences in overall QOL between COVID-19 survivors with and without PTSS [F((1,348)) = 1.067, P = 0.304]. A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that more severe depressive symptoms were significantly associated with PTSS in COVID-19 survivors (OR = 1.425, P < 0.001). Conclusions: PTSS were more severe in COVID-19 survivors compared to healthy controls in the post-COVID-19 era. Considering their negative impact on daily life and functional outcomes, regular assessment and appropriate treatments of PTSS should be conducted in COVID-19 survivors.","Yuan, Yuan; Liu, Zi-Han; Zhao, Yan-Jie; Zhang, Qinge; Zhang, Ling; Cheung, Teris; Jackson, Todd; Jiang, Guo-Qing; Xiang, Yu-Tao",Front Psychiatry,45,24

One challenge for producing effective prevention and treatment strategies is high intra-species genetic diversity. As different strains may have different biological properties, characterizing the genetic diversity is thus important to vaccine and drug design. Next-generation sequencing technology enables comprehensive characterization of both known and novel strains and has been widely adopted for sequencing viral populations. However, genome-scale reconstruction of haplotypes is still a challenging problem. In particular, haplotype assembly programs often produce contigs rather than full genomes. As a mutation in one gene can mask the phenotypic effects of a mutation at another locus, clustering these contigs into genome-scale haplotypes is still needed. Results We developed a contig binning tool, VirBin, which clusters contigs into different groups so that each group represents a haplotype. Commonly used features based on sequence composition and contig coverage cannot effectively distinguish viral haplotypes because of their high sequence similarity and heterogeneous sequencing coverage for RNA viruses. VirBin applied prototype-based clustering to cluster regions that are more likely to contain mutations specific to a haplotype. The tool was tested on multiple simulated sequencing data with different haplotype abundance distributions and contig sizes, and also on mock quasispecies sequencing data. The benchmark results with other contig binning tools demonstrated the superior sensitivity and precision of VirBin in contig binning for viral haplotype reconstruction.

Our aim was to design a semi-split inactivated vaccine offering a wide range of multi-epitope determinants important for the immune system including not only the spike (S) protein but also the envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins. We designed a semi-split vaccine prototype consisting of S protein-depleted viral particles and free S protein. Next, we investigated its immunogenic potential in BALB/c mice. The animals were immunized intradermally or intramuscularly with the dose adjusted with buffer or addition of aluminum hydroxide, respectively. The antibody response was evaluated by plasma analysis at 7 days after the first or second dose. The immune cell response was studied by flow cytometry analysis of splenocytes. The data showed a very early onset of both S protein-specific antibodies and virus-neutralizing antibodies at 90% inhibition regardless of the route of vaccine administration. However, significantly higher levels of neutralizing antibodies were detected in the intradermally (geometric mean titer - GMT of 7.8 ± 1.4) than in the intramuscularly immunized mice (GMT of 6.2 ± 1.5). In accordance with this, stimulation of cellular immunity by the semi-split vaccine was suggested by elevated levels of B and T lymphocyte subpopulations in the murine spleens. These responses were more predominant in the intradermally immunized mice compared with the intramuscular route of administration. The upward trend in the levels of plasmablasts, memory B cells, Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes, including follicular helper T cells, was confirmed even in mice receiving the vaccine intradermally at a dose of 0.5 μg. We demonstrated that the semi-split vaccine is capable of eliciting both humoral and cellular immunity early after vaccination. Our prototype thus represents a promising step toward the development of an efficient anti-COVID-19 vaccine for human use.","Petráš, Marek; Lesný, Petr; Musil, Jan; Limberková, Radomíra; Pátíková, Alžběta; Jirsa, Milan; Krsek, Daniel; Březovský, Pavel; Koladiya, Abhishek; Vaníková, Šárka; Macková, Barbora; Jírová, Dagmar; Krijt, Matyáš; Králová Lesná, Ivana; Adámková, Věra",bioRxiv,45,10

On average, ML is more accurate than human classifiers, across a variety of training and test datasets, and across evaluation panels. ML classifiers trained on different training sets are also more reliable than human classifiers, meaning that different ML classifiers are more consistent in assigning the same classifications to any given abstract, compared to different human classifiers. While the top five percentile of human classifiers can outperform ML in limited cases, selection and training of such classifiers is likely costly and difficult compared to training ML models. Our results suggest ML models are a cost effective and highly accurate method for addressing problems in comparative bibliometric analysis, such as harmonising the discipline classifications of research from different funding agencies or countries.","Goh, Yeow Chong; Cai, Xin Qing; Theseira, Walter; Ko, Giovanni; Khor, Khiam Aik",Scientometrics,45,3

Human to human transmission of the infection emphasizes the importance of adhering to public and social measure to halt its spread. However, the recent #ENDSARS protests led by angry youths in Nigeria resulted to complete flouting of all WHO guidelines meted to curb the spread of the virus. Given that the nation is the most populous African country with over 50 percent of her population been youths, this situation has huge implications for the country and Africa as a whole. The risk of community transmission occasioned by the protest, coupled with travels and active mobility across countries within the continent increases the risk of community transmission with possible increases in new cases over the next few weeks to months. From the foregoing, it is expedient to increase awareness and enforcement of the use of personal protective equipment especially use of nose masks, face shields and frequent hand washing or sanitizing in public places. These individual-targeted measures will go a long way to curtail the imminent community transmission of COVID-19 across Nigeria.

Infodemiology is now acknowledged by public health organizations and the WHO as an important emerging scientific field and critical area of practice during a pandemic. From the perspective of being the first “infodemiolgist” who originally coined the term almost two decades ago, I am positing four pillars of infodemic management: (1) information monitoring (infoveillance); (2) building eHealth Literacy and science literacy capacity; (3) encouraging knowledge refinement and quality improvement processes such as fact checking and peer-review; and (4) accurate and timely knowledge translation, minimizing distorting factors such as political or commercial influences. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, the United Nations has advocated that facts and science should be promoted and that these constitute the antidote to the current infodemic.

Since extensive and prolonged lockdowns are relatively novel experiences, not much is known about the well-being of individuals in such extreme situations. This research effort investigated the relationship between well-being elements and resiliency of 533 Filipino adults who were placed under the nationwide enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants comprised of 376 females (70.56%) and 157 males (29.45%). The median and mode ages of the participants is 23 years, while 25 is the mean age. PERMA Profiler was used to measure participants’ well-being elements, while Connor-Davidson Resiliency Scale-10 (CD-RISC-10) was used to measure their resiliency. Collected data were analyzed using the regression model and necessary condition analysis. This study corroborated that all the five pillars of well-being are significant positive correlates of resiliency (p < 0.00) in quarantined adults. The results shown accomplishment (β = 0.447, p < 0.01) positively predicts resiliency, while negative emotions (β = −0.171, p < 0.00) negatively predict resiliency. Lastly, the five pillars of well-being are necessary-but-not-sufficient conditions (ceiling envelopment with free disposal hull, CE-FDH p < 0.00) of resiliency. Our results cast a new light on well-being elements as constraints rather than enablers of resiliency. This novel result shows that optimum resiliency is only possible when all the five pillars of well-being are taken care of and when a person is at least minimally contented with their physical health. The present findings underscore the importance of a holistic as against an atomistic approach to maintaining good mental health, which suggests that deficiencies in certain areas of well-being may not be fully addressed by overcompensating on other areas, as all five pillars of well-being are necessary-but-not-sufficient conditions of resiliency. The study ends with the recommendation for the use of necessary condition analysis to study both classical and novel psychological research problems.","Camitan, Desiderio S.; Bajin, Lalaine N.",Front Psychol,45,17

Among 7 million patients, about 80% present mild to moderate disease, but studies dedicate to these patients are actually scarce. The aim of our study is to clarify the characteristics of laboratory test index of COVID-19 patient with moderate symptoms during the first wave of the pandemic in Wuhan, China. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included 107 adult inpatients with confirmed moderate disease of COVID-19 from the Affiliated Hospital of Jianghan University during February and early March 2020. All of these patients were recovered from COVID-19 and discharged from hospital. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of admission and discharge were extracted from electronic medical records and analyzed using SPSS, as well as among young, middle age and elderly people. RESULTS: The median age of this cohort of patients was 56.0 years. And the median hospitalization time was 16 days. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, asthenia and shortness of breath. On admission, laboratory results showed normal or increased neutrophil ratio, low lymphocyte count, decreased hemoglobin level, and increased inflammatory indicators (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)); and some patients were complicated with coagulation disorder and myocardial damage. Furthermore, patients older than 60 years had statistically higher CRP, ESR and fibrinogen level. As the health condition was improved at discharge, the median level of most laboratory results were in the normal range except hemoglobin and related blood cell count, as well as inflammatory indicator ESR. And patients older than 60 years showed slower recovery on coagulation parameters when compared to younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection induces a controllable inflammatory response in moderate disease of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Since patients older than 60 years had higher inflammatory state and more dysregulated coagulation condition, it might be essential to closely assess their illness.","Liu, Yuchen; Zhang, Xiaohong; Qiao, Jialu; Gong, Ruyu; You, Qiang; Sun, Jian; Liu, Wei; Sun, Binlian",J Clin Med Res,45,9

Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the ongoing seasonal influenza activity. Methods: We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to the spread of COVID-19 awareness and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of diagnoses. Findings: For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term government interventions can only delay the peak (by at most 7 months for a 3-month intervention). Interpretation: Handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing as a reaction to information dissemination about COVID-19 can be effective strategies to mitigate and delay the epidemic. We stress the importance of rapidly spreading awareness on the use of these self-imposed prevention measures in the population. Early-initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden.

Biometric security becomes a positive solution, adopted for many identification problems in various sectors, including Aviation. As the avionics business keeps growing worldwide, air terminals face the difficulties of increasingly more passenger volumes;with that, travelers' desire for a secure and consistent pass through the airport terminals is just expanding. COVID-19 has managed a hit in all parts of our lives. Maintaining social distance and wearing masks are very important in maintaining a person's health in this pandemic situation. In this scenario, facial recognition for passenger identification is difficult and tends to false acceptance of passengers with identical faces. To address this issue, contactless biometric traits like iris and fingerprints are considered for security growth. The paper deals with the fusion of iris and fingerprint to identify passengers without removing the masks and promotes safe travel. The iris and fingerprint features are extracted using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM) and cross number technique. Maintaining these templates requires more space for storage. To make this simple, Sparse autoencoder, an unsupervised deep learning technique is incorporated on the fused template for attaining the dimensionality reduction. A minimum cost matcher(MCM) is employed to increase the multimodal biometric system's accuracy and performance. Thus, the proposed system honors passenger security builds confidence in air travel, and also strives for economic growth.","Raiu, V.; Vidyasree, P.; Patel, A.; Ieee,",IEEE Aerospace Conference (AeroConf),45,18

Bangladesh is also one of the impacted countries, which needs to conduct sufficient tests to identify patients and accordingly adopt measures to limit the massive outbreak of this viral infection. But due to economic drawbacks and also unavailability of testing equipment, Bangladesh is lagging critically behind in test numbers. This study shows a pool testing method named Conditional Cluster Sampling (CCS) that utilizes soft computing and data analysis techniques to reduce the expense of total testing equipment. The proposed method also demonstrates its effectiveness compared to the traditional individual testing method. Firstly, according to patients’ symptoms and severity of their conditions, they are classified into four classes- Minor, Moderate, Major, Critical. After that Random Forest Classifier (RFC) is used to predict the class. Then random sampling is done from each class according to CCS. Finally, using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) for 100 cycles, the effectiveness of CCS is demonstrated for different probability levels of infection. It is shown that the CCS method can save up to 22% of the test kits that can save a huge amount of money as well as testing time.","Zoha, Naurin; Ghosh, Sourav Kumar; Arif-Ul-Islam, Mohammad; Ghosh, Tusher",Inform Med Unlocked,45,16

The main transmission route of this virus is thought to be via droplets, but airborne transmission has not been completely ruled out. METHODS: This is a contact tracing investigation of a young woman subsequently diagnosed with the 2009 H1N1 Influenza virus who was symptomatic during a long-distance bus trip from Spain to Switzerland. Fever and cough had begun 24 h earlier, 2 h before she stepped onto a bus for a long-distance trip. After the 2009 H1N1 virus had been confirmed in the patient, the other bus travellers were contacted by telephone on day 7 and 10 after the bus trip. RESULTS: Of the 72 individuals travelling on the bus with the H1N1-infected young woman, 52 (72%) could be contacted. Only one of these 52 developed fever, with onset of symptoms 3 days after the bus trip, and rRT-PCR analysis of the nasopharyngeal swab showed the infection to be caused by the 2009 H1N1 virus. One other person complained of coughing 1 day after the bus trip, but without fever, and no further investigation was carried out. All other passengers remained without fever, coughing, or arthralgia. The risk of transmission was calculated as 1.96% (95% confidence interval 0–5.76%). CONCLUSION: The transmission rate of 2009 H1N1 Influenza was low on a long-distance bus trip.

Through systematic review and meta-analysis, we have investigated the differences in clinical characteristics and outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with (+) and without (-) venous thromboembolism (VTE). 45 studies with a total of 8859 patients were included in the qualitative synthesis. Subsequently, 38 studies with a total of 7847 patients, were quantitatively analysed. There was no mortality difference between the VTE (-) and VTE (+) hospitalized COVID-19 patients (RR1.32 (0.97, 1.79); 0.07; I 2 64%, p<0.001). Patients with VTE (+) were more likely to get admitted to the intensive care unit (RR1.77 (1.26, 2.50); p<0.001; I 2 63%, p= 0.03) and mechanically ventilated (RR 2.35 (1.22, 4.53); p=0.01; I 2 88%, p<0.001). Moreover, male gender (RR 1.19 (1.14,1.24), p<0.001; I2 0%, p=0.68), increased the risk of VTE.

The analytical and clinical performances of LightMix® Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene kit, a widely used commercial assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection, have not been well studied. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance characteristics of the LightMix® E-gene kit in comparison with well-validated in-house developed tests. STUDY DESIGN: Serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 culture isolate extracts were used for analytical sensitivity evaluation. A total of 289 clinical specimens from 186 patients with suspected COVID-19 and 8 proficiency testing (PT) samples were used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the LightMix® E-gene kit against in-house developed COVID-19-RdRp/Hel and COVID-19-N RT-PCR assays. RESULTS: The LightMix® E-gene kit had a limit-of-detection of 1.8 × 10(-1) TCID(50)/mL, which was one log(10) lower than those of the two in-house RT-PCR assays. The LightMix® E-gene kit (149/289 [51.6%]) had higher diagnostic sensitivity than the in-house assays (144/289 [49.8%] for RdRp/Hel and 146/289 [50.5%] for N). All three assays gave correct results for all the PT samples. Cycle threshold (Cp) values of the LightMix® E-gene kit and in-house assays showed excellent correlation. Reproducibility of the Cp values was satisfactory with intra- and inter-assay coefficient of variation values <5%. Importantly, the LightMix® E-gene kit, when used as a stand-alone assay, was equally sensitive as testing algorithms using multiple SARS-CoV-2 assays.

To reduce the risk of COVID‐19 in HF patients, telemedicine has been encouraged. METHODS AND RESULTS: During the COVID‐19 pandemic, telemedical management with mainly over‐the‐phone appointments became a major strategy of follow‐up of our HF clinic patients. Previously, the large majority of patients have been seen in the hospital with direct patient‐provider contact. We compared both strategies of follow‐up, in pre‐pandemic (PPP) and pandemic (PP) periods, regarding total mortality and hospitalizations/emergency department (ED) visits due to HF exacerbation. We prospectively studied a cohort of 196 patients. The mean follow‐up time in PPP was 1.4 years. In this period, 20 patients died. In PP (follow‐up of 71 days), there was one additional death. Total mortality in the first year of follow‐up was 12.0%, matching the mortality predicted by the Meta‐Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure score. Considering hospitalizations/ED visits due to decompensated HF, there was no statistically significant difference between PPP and PP. Only one patient was diagnosed with COVID‐19. CONCLUSIONS: In the light of an increase in telemedical management of this cohort of HF patients, we were able to maintain a low rate of admissions due to HF decompensation, without an increment in mortality. Regarding these results, we encourage the incremental use of telemedicine in HF patients in the context of this or future pandemics and also in situations in which physical consultation might not be possible due to logistic issues.","Afonso Nogueira, Marta; Ferreira, Fernanda; Raposo, Ana Filipa; Mónica, Lurdes; Simões Dias, Sara; Vasconcellos, Rafael; Proença, Gonçalo",ESC Heart Fail,45,2

However, the development of a new, effective, and safe vaccine or drug often requires years and poses great risks. At this critical stage, there is an advantage in using existing clinically approved drugs to treat COVID-19. In this study, in vitro severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike pseudotyped viral infection experiments indicated that histamine H(1) antagonists loratadine (LOR) and desloratadine (DES) could prevent entry of the pseudotyped virus into ACE2-overexpressing HEK293T cells and showed that DES was more effective. Further binding experiments using cell membrane chromatography and surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that both antagonists could bind to ACE2 and that the binding affinity of DES was much stronger than that of LOR. Molecular docking results elucidated that LOR and DES could bind to ACE2 on the interface of the SARS-CoV-2-binding area. Additionally, DES could form one hydrogen bond with LYS31 but LOR binding relied on non-hydrogen bonds. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of LOR and DES on SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus viropexis by blocking spike protein–ACE2 interaction.

Cohen et al). Here, we consider what we believe to be the especially confused and confusing case of the ageing of the human immune system, commonly referred to as “immunosenescence”. But what exactly is meant by this term? It has been used loosely in the literature, resulting in a certain degree of confusion as to its definition and implications. Here, we argue that only those differences in immune parameters between younger and older adults that are associated in some definitive manner with detrimental health outcomes and/or impaired survival prospects should be classed as indicators of immunosenescence in the strictest sense of the word, and that in humans we know remarkably little about their identity. Such biomarkers of immunosenescence may nonetheless indicate beneficial effects in other contexts, consistent with the notion of antagonistic pleiotropy. Identifying what could be true immunosenescence in this respect requires examining: (1) what appears to correlate with age, though generality across human populations is not yet confirmed; (2) what clearly is part of a suite of canonical changes in the immune system that happen with age; (3) which subset of those changes accelerates rather than slows aging; and (4) all changes, potentially population-specific, that accelerate agig. This remains an immense challenge. These questions acquire an added urgency in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, given the clearly greater susceptibility of older adults to COVID-19.","Pawelec, Graham; Bronikowski, Anne; Cunnane, Stephen C.; Ferrucci, Luigi; Franceschi, Claudio; Fülöp, Tamas; Gaudreau, Pierrette; Gladyshev, Vadim N.; Gonos, Efstathios S.; Gorbunova, Vera; Kennedy, Brian K.; Larbi, Anis; Lemaître, Jean-François; Liu, Guang-Hui; Maier, Andrea B.; Morais, José A.; Nóbrega, Otávio T.; Moskalev, Alexey; Rikkert, Marcel Olde; Seluanov, Andrei; Senior, Alistair M; Ukraintseva, Svetlana; Van Haelen, Quentin; Witkowski, Jacek; Cohen, Alan A.",Mech Ageing Dev,45,1

When an epidemiological disease is prevalent, estimating the case fatality rate, the proportion of deaths out of the total cases, accurately and quickly is important as the case fatality rate is one of the crucial indicators of the risk of a disease. In this work, we propose an alternative estimator of the case fatality rate that provides more accurate estimate during an outbreak by reducing the downward bias (underestimation) of the naive CFR, the proportion of deaths out of confirmed cases at each time point, which is the most commonly used estimator due to the simplicity. The proposed estimator is designed to achieve the availability of real-time update by using the commonly reported quantities, the numbers of confirmed, cured, deceased cases, in the computation. To enhance the accuracy, the proposed estimator adapts a stratification, which allows the estimator to use information from heterogeneous strata separately. By the COVID-19 cases of China, South Korea and the United States, we numerically show the proposed stratification-based estimator plays a role of providing an early warning about the severity of a epidemiological disease that estimates the final case fatality rate accurately and shows faster convergence to the final case fatality rate.","Kim, Byungwon; Kim, Seonghong; Jang, Woncheol; Jung, Sungkyu; Lim, Johan",PLoS One,45,1

Many hospitals limited face-to-face appointments to only the pregnant woman and restricted the number of support people present during labour, birth, and postnatal visits to one person. How these restrictions were experienced by partners and support persons of childbearing women are unknown. AIM: To explore the experiences of partners and support persons of women receiving maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A two-phased qualitative study including an online survey and interviews. Analysis was undertaken using content analysis. FINDINGS: Partners and support persons experienced a sense of ‘missing out’ from the pregnancy and maternity care experience because of changes in the provision of care during the pandemic. They reported feelings of isolation, psychological distress, and reduced bonding time with babies. Conflicting information and processes within and across maternity services contributed to feelings of uncertainty and a perceived reduction in the quality of care. Partners and support persons were negatively impacted by restrictions on maternity wards, however they also perceived these to be of benefit to women. DISCUSSION: Many partners and support persons were negatively impacted by restrictions in maternity services during the pandemic; strategies to ensure their active involvement in maternity care are needed. CONCLUSION: This study offers insights from the unique perspective of partners and support people of women receiving maternity care during the pandemic.

We implemented workflow changes to our molecular pathology laboratory, a national reference center, to maximize safety and productivity. We assess the impact this situation had on our caseload and what conclusions can be drawn about the wider impact of the pandemic in oncological therapy in Portugal. Material and Methods. We reviewed our database for all oncological molecular tests requested between March and April of 2019 and 2020. For each case, we recorded age, sex, region of the country, requesting institution, sample type, testing method, and turnaround time (TAT). A comparison between years was made. RESULTS: The total number of tests decreased from 421 in 2019 to 319 in 2020 (p = 0.0027). The greatest reduction was in clinical trial-related cases. Routine cases were similar between years (267 vs. 256). TAT was higher in 2019 (mean 15 days vs. 12.3 days; p = 0.0003). Medium- to large-sized public hospitals in the north of the country were mostly responsible for the reduction in cases (p = 0.0153). CONCLUSIONS: Case reduction was observed at hospitals that have mostly been involved in the treatment of COVID-19 and in the north of the country, the region worst-hit by the pandemic.

However, the relatively low external quantum efficiencies (mostly lower than 10%) strongly restrict their wider or even potential applications, which have been known related to the intrinsic properties of high Al-content AlGaN semiconductor materials and especially their quantum structures. Here, we review recent progress in the development of novel concepts and techniques in AlGaN-based LEDs and summarize the multiple physical fields as a toolkit for effectively controlling and tailoring the crucial properties of nitride quantum structures. In addition, we describe the key challenges for further increasing the efficiency of DUV LEDs and provide an outlook for future developments.","Li, Jinchai; Gao, Na; Cai, Duanjun; Lin, Wei; Huang, Kai; Li, Shuping; Kang, Junyong",Light Sci Appl,45,28

This study aims to explore the status of resilience among tertiary hospitals in Shandong Province, China. METHODS: A stratified random sample (n = 50) was derived from tertiary A, tertiary B, and tertiary C hospitals in Shandong Province, and was surveyed by questionnaire. Data on hospital characteristics and 8 key domains of hospital resilience were collected and analysed. Variables were binary, and analysed using descriptive statistics such as frequencies. RESULTS: A response rate of 82% (n = 41) was attained. Factor analysis identified four key factors from eight domains which appear to reflect the overall level of disaster resilience. These were hospital safety, disaster management mechanisms, disaster resources and disaster medical care capability. The survey demonstrated that in regard to hospital safety, 93% had syndromic surveillance systems for infectious diseases and 68% had evaluated their safety standards. In regard to disaster management mechanisms, all had general plans, while only 20% had specific plans for individual hazards. 49% had a public communication protocol and 43.9% attended the local coordination meetings. In regard to disaster resources, 75.6% and 87.5% stockpiled emergency drugs and materials respectively, while less than a third (30%) had a signed Memorandum of Understanding with other hospitals to share these resources. Finally in regard to medical care, 66% could dispatch an on-site medical rescue team, but only 5% had a ‘portable hospital’ function and 36.6% and 12% of the hospitals could surge their beds and staff capacity respectively. The average beds surge capacity within 1 day was 13%. CONCLUSIONS: This study validated the broad utility of a framework for understanding and measuring the level of hospital resilience. The survey demonstrated considerable variability in disaster resilience arrangements of tertiary hospitals in Shandong province, and the difference between tertiary A hospitals and tertiary B hospitals was also identified in essential areas.","Zhong, Shuang; Hou, Xiang-Yu; Clark, Michele; Zang, Yu-Li; Wang, Lu; Xu, Ling-Zhong; FitzGerald, Gerard",BMC Health Serv Res,45,0

We examine 12-year trends in distribution of IMGs among IM training programs and explore differences in program perceptions towards IMG recruitment. METHODS: Since 2007, Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine Annual Surveys have collected data about trainees by medical school graduate type. Sixteen additional questions regarding perceptions of IMGs were included in the 2017 spring survey. RESULTS: The 2017 survey response rate was 63.3% (236/373) and ranged from 61.9 to 70.2% for the 2007–2019 Annual Surveys. During that 12-year period, 55–70% of community programs’ and 22–30% of university programs’ PGY1 positions were filled by IMGs. In 2017, 45% of community programs’ and 15% of university programs’ interview and ranking positions were allocated to IMGs. Departmental pressure (university 45.6% [95% CI 43.7–47.5]; community 28.2% [95% CI 26.6–29.7]; p = 0.007), institutional priority (university 64.0% [95% CI 62.1–66.0]; community 41% [95% CI 36.9–44.6]; p = 0.001), and reputational concerns (university 52.8% [95% CI 50.0–55.6]; community 38.5% [95% CI 36.0–40.9]; p = 0.045) were cited as factors influencing recruitment of IMGs. CONCLUSION: Our study was limited to exploring program factors in residency recruitment and did not assess applicant preferences. There is a large, longstanding difference in the recruitment of IMGs to US community-based and university residencies, beginning during the interview and ranking process. Further research in disparities in IMG recruitment is needed, including exploring pressures, preferences, and potential biases associated with the recruitment of IMGs.

However, most of the studies characterizing this phenomenon have focused on well‐established RBPs harboring classical RNA‐binding domains (RBDs). Recent proteome‐wide approaches have greatly expanded the census of RBPs, discovering hundreds of proteins that interact with RNA through unconventional RBDs. These domains include protein–protein interaction platforms, enzymatic cores, and intrinsically disordered regions. Here, we compared the experimentally determined census of RBPs to gene ontology terms and literature, finding that 472 proteins have previous links with viruses. We discuss what these proteins are and what their roles in infection might be. We also review some of the pioneering examples of unorthodox RBPs whose RNA‐binding activity has been shown to be critical for virus infection. Finally, we highlight the potential of these proteins for host‐based therapies against viruses. RNA Interactions with Proteins and Other Molecules > Protein–RNA Interactions: Functional Implications.

Moreover, TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 differ from TLR4 in two particularly important ways for antiviral immunity: they can be activated by nucleic acid agonists mimicking compounds produced during the viral cycle, and they are typically present within the cell, along the endocytic pathway, where they sense viral products in the intraluminal space. Investigations in mice have demonstrated that the TLR7/9–IFN and TLR3–IFN pathways are different and critical for protective immunity to various experimental viral infections. Investigations in humans with interleukin‐1 receptor‐associated kinase‐4 (IRAK‐4) deficiency (unresponsive to TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9), UNC‐93B deficiency (unresponsive to TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9), and TLR3 deficiency have recently shed light on the role of these two pathways in antiviral immunity in natural conditions. UNC‐93B‐ and TLR3‐deficient patients appear to be specifically prone to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV‐1) encephalitis, although clinical penetrance is incomplete, whereas IRAK‐4‐deficient patients appear to be normally resistant to most viruses, including HSV‐1. These experiments of nature suggest that the TLR7‐, TLR8‐, and TLR9‐dependent induction of IFN‐α, IFN‐β, and IFN‐λ is largely redundant in human antiviral immunity, whereas the TLR3‐dependent induction of IFN‐α, IFN‐β, and IFN‐λ is critical for primary immunity to HSV‐1 in the central nervous system in children but redundant for immunity to most other viral infections.","Zhang, Shen‐Ying; Jouanguy, Emmanuelle; Sancho‐Shimizu, Vanessa; Von Bernuth, Horst; Yang, Kun; Abel, Laurent; Picard, Capucine; Puel, Anne; Casanova, Jean‐Laurent",Immunol Rev,45,7

Despite the availability of effective treatments for depression, barriers to screening and diagnosis still exist. The use of current standardized depression assessments can lead to underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis due to subjective symptom reporting and the distinct cognitive, psychomotor, and somatic features of LLD. To overcome these limitations, there has been a growing interest in the development of objective measures of depression using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as natural language processing (NLP). NLP approaches focus on the analysis of acoustic and linguistic aspects of human language derived from text and speech and can be integrated with machine learning approaches to classify depression and its severity. In this review, we will provide rationale for the use of NLP methods to study depression using speech, summarize previous research using NLP in LLD, compare findings to younger adults with depression and older adults with other clinical conditions, and discuss future directions including the use of complementary AI strategies to fully capture the spectrum of LLD.","DeSouza, Danielle D.; Robin, Jessica; Gumus, Melisa; Yeung, Anthony",Front Psychiatry,45,20

If new mutants of SARS coronavirus do initiate another epidemic, administration of prophylactic antibodies to risk groups may supplement the stringent isolation procedures that contained the first SARS outbreak. METHOD: We developed a mathematical model to investigate the effects of hospital admission and targeted antibody prophylaxis on the reproduction number R, defined as the number of secondary cases generated by an index case, during different SARS outbreak scenarios. RESULTS: Assuming a basic reproduction number R(0)=3, admission of patients to hospital within 4.3 days of symptom onset is necessary to achieve outbreak control without the need to further reduce community-based transmission. Control may be enhanced by providing pre-exposure prophylaxis to contacts of hospitalized patients, and through contact tracing and provision of post-exposure prophylaxis. Antibody prophylaxis may also be employed to reduce R below one and thereby restrict outbreak size and duration. CONCLUSIONS: Patient isolation alone can be sufficient to control SARS outbreaks provided that the time from onset to admission is short. Antibody prophylaxis as supplemental measure generally allows for containment of higher R(0) values and restricts both the size and duration of an outbreak.","Bogaards, Johannes Antonie; Putter, Hein; Jan Weverling, Gerrit; ter Meulen, Jan; Goudsmit, Jaap",Travel Med Infect Dis,45,28

While excess postpartum weight retention exacerbates T2DM risk, lifestyle changes and behavior modifications can promote healthy postpartum weight loss and contribute to T2DM prevention efforts. However, some women have difficulty prioritizing self-care during this life stage. Efficacious interventions that women can balance with motherhood to reduce T2DM risk remain a goal. The objective of the Moms in Motion study is to evaluate the efficacy of a simple, novel, activity-boosting intervention using ankle weights worn with daily activities during a 6-month postpartum intervention among women with GDM. We hypothesize that women randomized to the 6-month intensity-modifying intervention will (1) demonstrate greater weight loss and (2) greater improvement in body composition and biomarker profile versus controls. METHODS: This study will be a parallel two-arm randomized controlled trial (n = 160). Women will be allocated 1:1 to an ankle weight intervention group or a standard-of-care control group. The intervention uses ankle weights (1.1 kg) worn on each ankle during routine daily activities (e.g., cleaning, childcare). Primary outcomes include pre- and post-assessments of weight from Visit 2 to Visit 3. Secondary outcomes include body composition, glycemia (2-h, 75 g oral glucose tolerance test), and fasting insulin. Exploratory outcomes include energy expenditure, diet, and psychosocial well-being. DISCUSSION: Beyond the expected significance of this study in its direct health impacts from weight loss, it will contribute to exploring (1) the mechanism(s) by which the intervention is successful (mediating effects of energy expenditure and diet on weight loss) and (2) the effects of the intervention on body composition and biomarkers associated with insulin resistance and metabolic health. Additionally, we expect the findings to be meaningful regarding the intervention’s effectiveness on engaging women with GDM in the postpartum period to reduce T2DM risk.

We tried to visualize virus-like particles (VLPs) in plasma samples from hepatitis B surface antigen- and antibody to hepatitis C virus (HCV)-negative blood donors with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and examined the association of the virus-like particles and the genomes of parenterally transmissible GBV-C/HGV. Twenty-three plasma samples, 13 with elevated ALT levels and 10 with normal ALT values, from blood donors without infections of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV, were subjected to a 20%–60% sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and virus-like particles were observed by electron microscopy. GBV-C/HGV RNAs in the plasmas were tested. Virus-like particles were found in the fractions with densities of 1.15–1.16 g/ml from 12 of 13 (92.3%) plasmas with elevated ALT levels and 1 of 10 (10%) normal controls. The ultrastructural morphology of visualized VLPs was pleomorphic in size and appearance; the majority of the VLPs were 50- to 80-nm spherical particles with a 35- to 45-nm inner core and 9- to 12-nm-long surface spikelike projections. Rodlike VLPs 50–70 nm in diameter with a length of 110–160 nm were also observed in the same samples. The incidence of detection of the circulating VLPs was significantly (P < 0.001) related to elevated ALT levels, but GBV-C/HGV RNAs were detected in none of the plasmas containing the virus-like particles. Spherical VLPs are detected in HBV- and HCV-negative plasmas significantly correlated with the elevation of ALT, suggesting that they are implicated in non-B, non-C hepatitis.","Kaito, Masahiko; Tanaka, Hideaki; Horiike, Shinichiro; Fujita, Naoki; Iwasa, Motoh; Kobayashi, Yoshinao; Gabazza, Esteban Cesar; Adachi, Yukihiko; Konishi, Masayoshi; Watanabe, Shozo",Med Mol Morphol,45,28

Methods: This multi-faceted, family medicine-led, interprofessional team-based remote monitoring program was developed at Womens College Hospital in Toronto, Ontario. A cross-sectional chart review of the first cohort of patients was conducted and learnings from the implementation of CovidCare@Home are described.

Phenomena such empty mass vaccination sites and wasted vaccine doses in some regions suggest that in addition to dispelling misinformation and building trust, developing more person-centered vaccination strategies, that are modelled on what people want could further increase uptake. To inform vaccine distribution strategies that are aligned with public preferences for COVID-19 vaccination campaign features we conducted a survey and discrete choice experiment among a representative sample of 2,895 people in the US, between March 15 and March 22, 2021. We found that on average the public prioritized ease, preferring single to two dose vaccinations, vaccinating once rather than annually and reduced waiting times at vaccination sites - for some these were the primary preference drivers. Vaccine enforcement reduced overall vaccine acceptance, with a trend of increasing control aversion with increasing vaccine hesitancy, particularly among those who were young, Black/African American or Republican. These data suggest that making vaccination easy and promoting autonomy by offering the public choices of vaccination brands and locations may increase uptake, and that vaccine mandates could compromise autonomy and increase control aversion in those who are hesitant - reducing vaccination in such groups and potentially undermining the goals of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.","Eshun-Wilson, I.; Mody, A.; Tram, K.

The aim of this case report is to highlight the importance of screening cancer patients and those with co-morbidities such as renal impairment for Covid-19 and encouraging them to get vaccinated before undergoing elective surgeries. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of an 80 year old male patient with renal impairment who developed Covid-19 infection after transurethral resection of high grade transitional cell carcinoma of urinary bladder. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Although intra-hospital contagion of Covid-19 is not rare, increased risk of acquiring Covid-19 among cancer patient particularly if they have co-morbidities like renal impairment should be kept in mind and strict protective measures for Covid-19 for those patients should be done before, during and after the procedure. CONCLUSION: We theorized that patients with high grade transitional cell carcinoma of urinary bladder should be screened for Covid-19 and get vaccinated before the procedure.","Murshidi, Mujalli Mhailan; Ihmeidan, Mohammad Khaled; Murshidi, Muayyad Mujalli; Murshidi, Rand Mujalli (Sheikh Moh'd); Murshidi, Raghad Mujalli",Int J Surg Case Rep,45,24

Employing the city-level turnover data of political leaders in China between 2000 and 2018 and utilizing the fixed effects ordered logit model, we find that the likelihood of promotion of local leaders rises with their economic performance. This relationship holds more firmly in the municipal party secretary. The probability is also found to decrease with the economic performance of their immediate predecessors and neighboring cities. This finding is robust to various robustness tests. We interpret the finding as evidence that the relative economic performance (peer effects) also contributes to the local political turnover, in particular within a province. Moreover, after the Third Plenary Session of the 18(th) CPC Central Committee, a material change in the personnel arrangement within the party arises and this promotion mechanism shows a dynamic change. Our study sheds some light on the growing literature emphasizing the relationship between political turnover and economic performance.","Luo, Weijie; Qin, Shikun",J Chin Polit Sci,45,30

However, there have also been positively experienced changes in terms of awareness of nature, reflection of life, more intensive relationships, meaningful digital media usage to connect with others, and interest in spirituality. We were interested in the dynamics of these indicators directly after the first lockdown, the summer months and during the second wave of the pandemic with its second lockdown, and how they relate to the perceived restrictions, fears, and worries. Method: Survey with standardized questionnaires, i.e., Perceived Changes Questionnaire, WHO-Five Well-being Index, Brief Multidimensional Life Satisfaction Scale, Awe/Gratitude scale. Participants were categorized as cohort 1 (June 2020; n = 1,333), cohort 2 (July to September 2020, n = 823), and cohort three (October 2020 to January 2021, n = 625). Results: Participants perceived changes in specific attitudes and behaviors, which have impacted their well-being and life satisfaction. Compared to their experiences directly after the first wave of the pandemic (cohort 1), well-being (Hedge's g = 0.83) and life satisfaction (g = 0.63) decreased during the second wave (cohort 3) and participants' stressors increased (g = −0.94). At the same time, positive perceptions such as Nature/Silence/Contemplation (g = 0.67), Spirituality (g = 0.62), Relationships (g = 0.55), and Digital media usage declined (g = 0.31), but not Reflections on life (g = −0.03). In cohort 3, the proportion of persons relying on their faith as a strong hold was declining also in nominally religious persons. Awe/Gratitude was among the best predictors of perceived positive changes, indicating a resource which is nevertheless declining during the second wave of the pandemic (g = 0.60). Conclusions: Several perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors have changed, particularly during the second wave of the pandemic, which had a strong influence on psychological health. Although Awe/Gratitude was confirmed as the best predictor of perceived positive changes, this resource may not buffer against the negative outcomes of the pandemic but helps to recognize the still positive aspects in life. There is a need for new and not yet defined public health communities that could focus on persons which are affected in their physical, mental, social, and spiritual health and well-being due to the pandemic.","Büssing, Arndt; Rodrigues Recchia, Daniela; Dienberg, Thomas; Surzykiewicz, Janusz; Baumann, Klaus",Front Psychiatry,45,10

However, whether the strategy of engaging PHI as supplementary coverage is effective cannot be determined without knowing the impact of supplementary PHI on healthcare access and utilization, the evidence on which is currently absent in China. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of supplementary PHI on hospitalization and physical examination to provide such evidence in the Chinese setting. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from the 2015 wave of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Using probit models and bivariate probit models with instrumental variables (IVs), we evaluated the effects of supplementary PHI on the utilization of hospitalization and physical examination. Our analyses provided evidence that supplementary PHI increased the probability of physical examination but decreased that of hospitalization. Our findings suggest that supplementary PHI in China may effectively promote the use of high-value preventive care, thereby reducing subsequent utilization of expensive medical services.

No specific therapies are available to treat Covid-19 so far. Recently, main protease (M(pro)), a potential drug target from SARS-CoV-2 has been successfully crystallised. The present study is aimed at assessment of bioactive antiviral phytochemicals as potential SARS-COV-2 M(pro) inhibitors, using ensemble docking, molecular dynamics and MM-PBSA calculations. Ensemble docking studies were performed with Autodock vina program. The top 5 compounds having highest binding free energy were subjected to 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations with Gromacs. The resulting trajectories of converged period of MD were further exploited in MM-PBSA calculations to derive accurate estimates of binding free energies. The MD results were analysed with respect to RMSD, RMSF and hydrogen bond formation and occupancy parameters. The drugs remdesivir and nelfinavir were used as standard drugs for comparative studies. In the docking studies five phytochemicals, dalpanitin, amentoflavone, naringin, hinokiflavone, and rutin were found having lowest binding free energies (< − 10 kcal mol(−1)) which is lower than standard drugs. MD studies suggested that the complexes of these five phytochemicals with M(pro) stabilize with well accepted RMSD. Amongst these phytochemicals, hinokiflavove, amentoflavone and naringin were found having better binding affinity with ΔG(binging) than the standard drug remdesivir. Investigations and validation of these inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 would be helpful in bring these molecules at the clinical settings.

This article lays out the origins and distinctive features of China's development policies and vision, and argues that in a post-Covid world these may constitute an appealing alternative to the US-led development paradigm for many developing countries. We contrast the universalism and rigidity of contemporary development orthodoxy with China's emphasis on bilateral and pragmatic forms of development cooperation borne out of its domestic experience. While Chinese development assistance and loans enhance its soft power, partner countries are offered significant autonomy and flexibility. We conclude by outlining three factors which may impact the future of Chinese leadership in the field of global development; a reconciliation of global financial governance and China's development lending, the outcome of the upcoming American presidential election and domestic discontent within China over the Belt and Road Initiative.","Schindler, Seth; Jepson, Nicholas; Cui, Wenxing",,45,17

However, the factors determining whether or not pneumonia develops remain to be fully uncovered. We therefore explored the associations of several lifestyle factors with signs of pneumonia in COVID-19. METHODS: Between May and July 2020, we conducted an online survey of 201 adults in Germany who had recently gone through COVID-19, predominantly as outpatients. Of these, 165 had a PCR-based diagnosis and 36 had a retrospective diagnosis by antibody testing. The survey covered demographic information, eight lifestyle factors, comorbidities and medication use. We defined the main outcome as the presence vs. the absence of signs of pneumonia, represented by dyspnea, the requirement for oxygen therapy or intubation. RESULTS: Signs of pneumonia occurred in 39 of the 165 individuals with a PCR-based diagnosis of COVID-19 (23.6%). Among the lifestyle factors examined, only overweight/obesity was associated with signs of pneumonia (odds ratio 2.68 (1.29–5.59) p = 0.008). The observed association remained significant after multivariate adjustment, with BMI as a metric variable, and also after including the antibody-positive individuals into the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study finds an association of overweight/obesity with signs of pneumonia in COVID-19. This finding suggests that a signal proportional to body fat mass, such as the hormone leptin, impairs the body’s ability to clear SARS-CoV-2 before pneumonia develops. This hypothesis concurs with previous work and should be investigated further to possibly reduce the proportion of severe cases of COVID-19.","Sacco, Vanessa; Rauch, Barbara; Gar, Christina; Haschka, Stefanie; Potzel, Anne L.; Kern-Matschilles, Stefanie; Banning, Friederike; Benz, Irina; Meisel, Mandy; Seissler, Jochen; Lechner, Andreas",PLoS One,45,28

The behavioral factors of vaccine hesitancy or refusal are a crucial dimension that need to be understood in order to design appropriate interventions. The aim of this study was to explore the behavioral determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and to provide recommendations to increase the acceptance and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in Bangladesh. METHODS: We employed a Barrier Analysis (BA) approach to examine twelve potential behavioral determinants (drawn from the Health Belief Model [HBM] and Theory of Reasoned Action [TRA]) of intended vaccine acceptance. We conducted 45 interviews with those who intended to take the vaccine (Acceptors) and another 45 interviews with those who did not have that intention (Non-acceptors). We performed data analysis to find statistically significant differences and to identify which beliefs were most highly associated with acceptance and non-acceptance with COVID-19 vaccines. RESULTS: The behavioral determinants associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Dhaka included perceived social norms, perceived safety of COVID-19 vaccines and trust in them, perceived risk/susceptibility, perceived self-efficacy, perceived positive and negative consequences, perceived action efficacy, perceived severity of COVID-19, access, and perceived divine will. In line with the HBM, beliefs about the disease itself were highly predictive of vaccine acceptance, and some of the strongest statistically-significant (p<0.001) predictors of vaccine acceptance in this population are beliefs around both injunctive and descriptive social norms. Specifically, Acceptors were 3.2 times more likely to say they would be very likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine if a doctor or nurse recommended it, twice as likely to say that most people they know will get a vaccine, and 1.3 times more likely to say that most close family and friends will get a vaccine. The perceived safety of vaccines was found to be important since Non-acceptors were 1.8 times more likely to say that COVID-19 vaccines are “not safe at all”. Beliefs about one’s risk of getting COVID-19 disease and the severity of it were predictive of being a vaccine acceptor: Acceptors were 1.4 times more likely to say that it was very likely that someone in their household would get COVID-19, 1.3 times more likely to say that they were very concerned about getting COVID-19, and 1.3 times more likely to say that it would be very serious if someone in their household contracted COVID-19. Other responses of Acceptors on what makes immunization easier may be helpful in programming to boost acceptance, such as providing vaccination through government health facilities, schools, and kiosks, and having vaccinators maintain proper COVID-19 health and safety protocols. CONCLUSION: An effective behavior change strategy for COVID-19 vaccines uptake will need to address multiple beliefs and behavioral determinants, reducing barriers and leveraging enablers identified in this study. National plans for promoting COVID-19 vaccination should address the barriers, enablers, and behavioral determinants found in this study in order to maximize the impact on COVID-19 vaccination acceptance.","Kalam, Md.

This is particularly important as significant amounts of aerosols are generated during dental procedures, posing risk to dental care personnel and patients. Thus, reducing the titres of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva of infected patients could be one of the key approaches to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission during dental procedures. In this randomised control trial, the efficacy of three commercial mouth-rinse viz. povidone-iodine (PI), chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), in reducing the salivary SARS-CoV-2 viral load in COVID-19 positive patients were compared with water. A total of 36 COVID-19 positive patients were recruited, of which 16 patients were randomly assigned to four groups: PI group (n=4), CHX group (n=6), CPC group (n=4) and water as control group (n=2). Saliva samples were collected from all patients at baseline and at 5 min, 3 h and 6 h post-application of mouth-rinses/water. The samples were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR analysis. The fold change of Ct values were significantly increased in CPC group at 5 minutes and 6 h time points (p<0.05), while it showed significant increase at 6 h timepoint for PI group (p<0.01). Considering Ct values as an indirect method of arbitrarily quantifying the viral load, it can be postulated that CPC mouth-rinse can decrease the salivary SARS-CoV-2 levels within 5 minutes of use, compared to water rinsing. The effect of decreasing salivary load with CPC and PI mouth-rinsing was observed to be sustained at 6 h time point. Within the limitation of the current study, it can be concluded that use of CPC and PI formulated commercial mouth-rinses, with its sustained effect on reducing salivary SARS-CoV-2 level, may be useful as a pre-procedural rinse to help reduce the transmission of COVID-19.","Seneviratne, C.

We aimed at testing the feasibility of this approach for use in a long-term study focusing on infections in children in Germany. METHODS: Parents of 1- to 3-year-old children (n = 75) were recruited in nursery schools. They were asked to complete a symptom diary on a daily basis and to take monthly and symptom-triggered nasal swabs and stool samples from their child over the study period of three months. Feasibility was measured by means of the return proportions of symptom diaries and bio samples; acceptance was assessed by a questionnaire delivered to participants at the end of the study. RESULTS: The majority of the participants filled in the symptom diary during the three months study for 75 or more days (77.3 %), and provided the monthly nasal swabs (62.7 %) and stool samples (65.3 %). The time needed for the tasks was acceptable for most participants (symptom diary: 92.3 %, nasal swabs: 98.5 %, stool samples: 100.0 %).

Lessons from the local healthcare system at the centre of early COVID-19 outbreak in Italy.,20.83535,1.575868,2021-06-01,"The recent ‘outburst’ of COVID-19 spurred efforts to model and forecast its diffusion patterns, either in terms of infections, people in need of medical assistance (ICU occupation) or casualties. Forecasting patterns and their implied end states remains cumbersome when few (stochastic) data points are available during the early stage of diffusion processes. Extrapolations based on compounded growth rates do not account for inflection points nor end-states. In order to remedy this situation, we advance a set of heuristics which combine forecasting and scenario thinking. Inspired by scenario thinking we allow for a broad range of end states (and their implied growth dynamics, parameters) which are consecutively being assessed in terms of how well they coincide with actual observations. When applying this approach to the diffusion of COVID-19, it becomes clear that combining potential end states with unfolding trajectories provides a better-informed decision space as short term predictions are accurate, while a portfolio of different end states informs the long view. The creation of such a decision space requires temporal distance. Only to the extent that one refrains from incorporating more recent data, more plausible end states become visible. Such dynamic approach also allows one to assess the potential effects of mitigating measures. As such, our contribution implies a plea for dynamically blending forecasting algorithms and scenario-oriented thinking, rather than conceiving them as substitutes or complements.","Decock, Kristof; Debackere, Koenraad; Vandamme, Anne- Mieke; Van Looy, Bart",Scientometrics,45,28

Multiple chronic “diseases of civilization,” such as cardiovascular problems, cancers, ADHD, and dementias are prevalent, increasing morbidity rates. Stress, including the disruption of traditional sleep patterns by modern lifestyles, plays a prominent role in the etiology of these diseases, including obstructive sleep apnea. Surprisingly, jaw shrinkage since the agricultural revolution, leading to an epidemic of crooked teeth, a lack of adequate space for the last molars (wisdom teeth), and constricted airways, is a major cause of sleep-related stress. Despite claims that the cause of this jaw epidemic is somehow genetic, the speed with which human jaws have changed, especially in the last few centuries, is much too fast to be evolutionary. Correlation in time and space strongly suggests the symptoms are phenotypic responses to a vast natural experiment—rapid and dramatic modifications of human physical and cultural environments. The agricultural and industrial revolutions have produced smaller jaws and less-toned muscles of the face and oropharynx, which contribute to the serious health problems mentioned above. The mechanism of change, research and clinical trials suggest, lies in orofacial posture, the way people now hold their jaws when not voluntarily moving them in speaking or eating and especially when sleeping. The critical resting oral posture has been disrupted in societies no longer hunting and gathering. Virtually all aspects of how modern people function and rest are radically different from those of our ancestors. We also briefly discuss treatment of jaw symptoms and possible clinical cures for individuals, as well as changes in society that might lead to better care and, ultimately, prevention.","Kahn, Sandra; Ehrlich, Paul; Feldman, Marcus; Sapolsky, Robert; Wong, Simon",Bioscience,45,16

Understanding the factors related to such information sources aids health professionals in educating individuals. OBJECTIVE: This study used data collected from the online survey study on COVID-19 in Taiwan to examine what major COVID-19 information sources are available and which sources are significantly related to the self-confidence of people in coping with COVID-19 in Taiwan. METHODS: A total of 1904 participants (1270 non–health-care workers and 634 health care workers) were recruited from the Facebook advertisement. Their major sources of information about COVID-19, the relationships between the sources and demographic factors, and the relationships between the sources and the self-confidence in coping with COVID-19 were surveyed. RESULTS: Most Taiwanese people relied on the internet for COVID-19 information. Many respondents also used a variety of sources of information on COVID-19; such variety was associated with sex, age, and the level of worry toward COVID-19, as well as if one was a health care worker. For health care workers, the use of formal lessons as an information source was significantly associated with better self-confidence in coping with COVID-19. The significant association between receiving information from more sources and greater self-confidence was found only in health care workers but not in non–health-care workers.

Thereon, based on the urgent need for therapeutic molecules, we conducted in silico based docking and simulation molecular interaction studies on repurposing drugs, targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Further, the best binding energy of doxorubicin interacting with virus spike protein (PDB: 6VYB) was observed to be -6.38 kcal/mol and it was followed by exemestane and gatifloxacin. The molecular simulation dynamics analysis of doxorubicin, Reference Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square fluctuation (RMSF), Radius of Gyration (Rg), and formation of hydrogen bonds plot interpretation suggested, a significant deviation and fluctuation of Doxorubicin-Spike RBD complex during the whole simulation period. The Rg analysis has stated that the Doxorubicin-Spike RBD complex was stable during 15000-35000ps MDS. The results have suggested that doxorubicin could inhibit the virus spike protein and prevent the access of the SARS-CoV-2 to the host cell.

Over the course of COVID disease, we observed a poor tolerance to HD sessions with a marked tendency of clinical deterioration over them. The objective is to evaluate changes on immunological system over HD session on patients affected with COVID19 compared with patients without COVID19. METHOD: Fourteen HD patients were studied including 9 confirmed COVID19 infection and 5 healthy controls. Predialysis and postdialysis blood samples were compared to study alterations on immune status. We identified cytoKines by Luminex (CCL2, CXCL10, IL1Ra, IL10, IL12p70, TNFα, IL17Ra, IL6, IL7) and adaptive lymphocyte subsets (CD4/CD8 naïve, CD4/CD8 MC, CD4/CD8 MP, CD19, CD56). Monocyte subsets (CD14+CD16-, CD14+CD16+, CD14-CD16+) were detected from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), as well as immune activation (CD11b, HLA-DR, CD86) and migration factors (CCR2, CCR5). The supernatant of isolated CD14+ cells after 4-hour stimulation with LPS where analysed by Luminex to measure cytokines (CCL2, CXCL10, GM-CSF, IL10, IL12p70, IL17Ra, IL6, IL7, TNFα). RESULTS: Patients with COVID19 presented predialysis: (1) higher plasmatic levels of IL12p70, TNFα e IL7, (2) lymphopenia and neutrophilia, (3) higher percentage of intermediate monocytes and lower of non-classical, (4) lower membrane expression of CCR2, HLA-DR y CD86 over Cd14+ cells, and (5) higher production of CCL2, GM-CSF, IL10, IL12p70 y IL17Ra by LPS stimulated monocytes compared with patients without COVID19. When analysed the fold-change between pre and postdialysis values, patients with COVID19 infection present a: (a) higher plasmatic levels of IL6, IL1Ra, CCL2 e CXCL10, (b) reductions of total lymphocites, (c) higher membrane expression of CCR2, CD33 y CD86 on CD14+ cells, and (d) higher production of TNFα, GM-CSF, IL10, IL17, IL6 e IL7 by LPS stimulated monocytes compared with patients without COVID19. No differences on lymphocite subset were found. CONCLUSION: The clinical deterioration on COVID19 infected patients over HD session could be related with monocyte activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion.","Sandino Pérez, Justo; Utrero-Rico, Alberto; Yuste, Claudia; Gutierrez-Solis, Elena; Morales, Enrique; Mérida, Evangelina; Gonzalez-Cuadrado, Cecilia; Chivite-Lacaba, Marta; Mancebo, Esther; Paz-Artal, Estela; Caro Espada, Paula Jara",Nephrol Dial Transplant,45,8

Yet, to date, there is no evidence of this disproportionate impact on non-national individuals, including economic migrants, short-term travellers and refugees. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Italian surveillance system of all COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed cases tested positive from the beginning of the outbreak (20th of February) to the 19th of July 2020. We used multilevel negative-binomial regression models to compare the case fatality and the rate of admission to hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) between Italian and non-Italian nationals. The analysis was adjusted for differences in demographic characteristics, pre-existing comorbidities, and period of diagnosis. RESULTS: We analyzed 213 180 COVID-19 cases, including 15 974 (7.5%) non-Italian nationals. We found that, compared to Italian cases, non-Italian cases were diagnosed at a later date and were more likely to be hospitalized {[adjusted rate ratio (ARR)=1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33–1.44]} and admitted to ICU (ARR=1.19, 95% CI: 1.07–1.32), with differences being more pronounced in those coming from countries with lower human development index (HDI). We also observed an increased risk of death in non-Italian cases from low-HDI countries (ARR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.01–1.75). CONCLUSIONS: A delayed diagnosis in non-Italian cases could explain their worse outcomes compared to Italian cases.

Recent reports suggest that ACE2, which is the target protein to invade the host, has a ubiquitous presence in human organs, including lung parenchyma, gastrointestinal tract, nasal mucosa, renal and urinary tract, airway epithelia, lymphoid tissues, reproductive organs, vascular endothelium and neurons. In this scenario, neurologists are particularly involved into considering even more specific therapeutic strategies according to the available data during the pandemic. In particular, MS patients are usually receiving disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) with immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory effects, which increase the risk of infections and morbidity, compared with the general population. Development of PML or other serious opportunistic infections during treatment with natalizumab forces to consider whether de-risking strategies are needed in this particular context and how to manage a high-efficacy treatment. METHODS: In this paper we report on a patient treated with natalizumab for relapsing MS who developed COVID-19 and recovered in a few days without complications. RESULTS: After recovery natalizumab has been administered in the window of the extended interval dosing (EID), without reporting any worsening or new symptoms.

The COVID-19 pandemic deeply influenced UCSDHS activities as new public health challenges increasingly related to high population density, cross-border traffic, economic disparities, and interconnectedness between cross-border communities, which accelerated development of clinical collaborations between UCSDHS and several border community hospitals – one in the US, two in Mexico – as high volumes of severely ill patients overwhelmed hospitals. OBJECTIVE: We describe the development, implementation, feasibility, and acceptance of a novel critical care support program in three community hospitals along the US-Mexico border. METHODS: We created and instituted a hybrid critical care program involving: 1) in-person activities to perform needs assessments of equipment and supplies and hands-on training and education, and 2) creation of a telemedicine-based (Tele-ICU) service for direct patient management and/or consultative, education-based experiences. We collected performance metrics surrounding adherence to evidence-based practices and staff perceptions of critical care delivery. FINDINGS: In-person intervention phase identified and filled gaps in equipment and supplies, and Tele-ICU program promoted adherence to evidence-based practices and improved staff confidence in caring for critically ill COVID-19 patients at each hospital.

However, there was no brief instrument to screen for a range of psychological problems in different domains after a potentially traumatic event, and for risk factors and protective factors. Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the internal consistency and concurrent validity of the Japanese version of the Global Psychotrauma Screen (GPS) in a traumatized sample in Japan. Method: A total sample (n = 58) with varying levels of potential posttrauma symptoms due to domestic violence or other events were recruited into this study. Self-rating measures of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and alcohol problems were conducted to investigate the concurrent validity. Results: The results show that a range of posttrauma symptoms assessed by the GPS were highly endorsed by this traumatized sample in all domains except for self-harm, derealization, and depersonalization. The GPS sum score was highly correlated (r > 0.79) with other measures of PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Also, the subdomain scores showed acceptable correlations with corresponding domain measures. Participants who had been sexually assaulted or had unwanted sexual experiences, and participants who had been physically assaulted during childhood, had higher scores on the total GPS and on subdomains of PTSD, as well as symptoms associated with Complex PTSD. Conclusions: This study provides an initial indication that the GPS may be a useful screening tool for trauma survivors and elucidates that the consequences of trauma are not limited to PTSD.","Oe, Misari; Kobayashi, Yudai; Ishida, Tetsuya; Chiba, Hiromi; Matsuoka, Michiko; Kakuma, Tatsuyuki; Frewen, Paul; Olff, Miranda",European journal of psychotraumatology,45,18

The etiological agent of this disease is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the high transmissibility of the virus led to its rapid global spread and a major pandemic (ongoing at the time of writing this review). The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 can vary widely from non-evident or minor symptoms to severe acute respiratory syndrome and multi-organ damage, causing death. Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been recognized as a common complication of COVID-19 and in many cases, kidney replacement therapy (KRT) is required. The presence of kidney abnormalities on hospital admission and the development of AKI are related to a more severe presentation of COVID-19 with higher mortality rate. The high transmissibility and the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are in part due to the high affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for its receptor, angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is widely expressed in human organs and is especially abundant in the kidneys. A debate on the role of ACE2 in the infectivity and pathogenesis of COVID-19 has emerged: Does the high expression of ACE2 promotes higher infectivity and more severe clinical manifestations or does the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 reduce the bioavailability of the enzyme, depleting its biological activity, which is closely related to two important physiological systems, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS), thereby further contributing to pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the dual role of ACE2 in the infectivity and pathogenesis of COVID-19, highlighting the effects of COVID-19-induced ACE2 depletion in the renal physiology and how it may lead to kidney injury. The ACE2 downstream regulation of KKS, that usually receives less attention, is discussed. Also, a detailed discussion on how the triad of symptoms (respiratory, inflammatory, and coagulation symptoms) of COVID-19 can indirectly promote renal injury is primary aborded.","Azinheira Nobrega Cruz, Nayara; Gonçalves de Oliveira, Lilian Caroline; Tedesco Silva Junior, Helio; Osmar Medina Pestana, Jose; Casarini, Dulce Elena",Front Physiol,45,21

A critical component of that care relies on a functional supply chain to ensure availability of abortion drugs and supplies within the health system. Disruptions in the supply of medical abortion drugs delay provision of abortion services and can increase the risks to a woman’s health. We examine the ways in which supply chain management (SCM) affects women’s ability to access safe and timely abortion to meet their reproductive health needs and highlight the gap in evaluation research on which SCM interventions best improve access to safe abortion care. SCM comprises a critical component of efficient and sustainable abortion service provision and is a requisite for expansion of services. Furthermore, governments are responsible for safeguarding links in the abortion supply chain, from registration to distribution of abortion drugs and supplies. Strategic public–private partnerships and use of innovative local or community-based distribution mechanisms can strengthen supply chain systems. Finally, alternatives to the pull-based models of distribution could alleviate bottlenecks in the final steps of abortion supply chains. Programs aimed at increasing access to safe and comprehensive abortion care must include SCM as a foundational component of service provision. Without access to a sustainable and affordable supply of abortion drugs and equipment, any attempt at providing abortion services will be critically limited.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: An assessment-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary referral hospital in China. Eligible patients were stratified according to their weighted corticospinal tract lesion load and then randomly assigned to an experimental group (n = 121) or a control group (n = 103). The experimental group received rehabilitation nursing from well-trained, qualified nurses (30 minutes per session, two sessions per day for seven consecutive days). The control group received therapist-led rehabilitation with the same timing and frequency. Comparative analysis of the primary outcomes was performed to determine non-inferiority with a predetermined non-inferiority margin. The primary outcomes were the Motor Assessment Scale, Fugl-Meyer Assessment, and the Action Research Arm Test assessed at baseline and after seven days of treatment. The secondary outcomes were the modified Barthel Index, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and the modified Rankin Scale, evaluated before and after the intervention and at 4 and 12 weeks of follow-up. RESULTS: Two hundred participants completed the trial. In both groups, all outcomes improved significantly after seven days and at follow-ups. The rehabilitation nursing program was non-inferior to therapist-led treatment with lower 95% confidence limits beyond the margins for primary outcomes (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Both treatments had comparable effects; however, no definite conclusion could be drawn. Adequately powered studies are required.","Wang, Jianmiao; Zhang, Yuping; Chen, Yuanyuan; Li, Mei; Yang, Hongyan; Chen, Jinhua; Tang, Qiaomin; Jin, Jingfen",Clin Interv Aging,45,26

Specific data related to lung cancer (LC) patient management, active treatment, and/or recent diagnosis are still very limited. Here, we aimed to investigate the clinical presentation, baseline features, and clinical outcomes of LC patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective case study was performed at Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São Joao, a tertiary hospital in the North of Portugal. Data from LC patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were collected during the first 10 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020–January 2021). RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients with active LC were diagnosed with COVID-19, being adenocarcinoma the most common histological type present (n = 13, 46.4%). Sixteen patients had metastatic stage IV LC (61.5%). Twenty-five patients (89.3%) had relevant comorbidities including hypertension (39.3%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (32.1%). For patients undergoing antineoplastic treatment, the median time from the last chemotherapy administration to COVID-19 diagnosis was of 16 days (interquartile range = 13–41 days). Half of patients were previously on corticosteroid therapy. Twenty patients (71.4%) needed hospitalization, 18 received oxygen therapy (64.3%), 3 (10.7%) of them received high-flow nasal cannula with good tolerability, and 1 (3.6%) needed non-invasive ventilation. Hydroxychloroquine and antibiotics were given to 4 (14.3%) and 12 (42.9%) patients, respectively. Seven patients (25%) died at a median time of 5 days following COVID-19 diagnosis. CONCLUSION: This is one of the first studies reporting the adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19 in LC patients at same time that adds evidence regarding the need to create protocols and guidelines to reduce the infection risk in such patients.","Coelho, David Barros; Santos, Vanessa; Araújo, David; Bastos, Hélder Novais; Magalhães, Adriana; Hespanhol, Venceslau; Queiroga, Henrique; Cruz-Martins, Natália; Fernandes, Maria Gabriela O.",Front Mol Biosci,45,20

Une nouvelle stratégie de traitement, en plus de la thérapie antivirale seule, est susceptible d’être nécessaire pour avoir un impact significatif sur les résultats cliniques. Un traitement immunomodulateur pour réguler à la baisse de choc cytokinique peut fournir des informations sur le traitement de COVID-19. L’utilisation combinée d’un agent immunomodulateur avec un agent antiviral peut donner aux médecins plus de temps pour fournir un traitement de soutien aux patients atteints de COVID-19. Dans cette revue de la littérature, les rôles de plusieurs médicaments anti-inflammatoires ont été passés en revue pour explorer leur efficacité dans la lutte contre le SARS-CoV-2. Summary To date, treatment options for severe COVID-19 remain limited and there is currently no effective drug or vaccine for the treatment or prevention of specific SARS-CoV-2 to treat critically ill patients. A new treatment strategy, in addition to antiviral therapy alone, may be required to have a significant impact on clinical outcomes. Immunomodulatory therapy to downregulate cytokine shock may provide information on the treatment of COVID-19. Combined use of an immunomodulatory agent with an antiviral agent may give doctors more time to provide supportive therapy to patients with COVID-19. In this review of the literature, the roles of several anti-inflammatory drugs were reviewed to explore their effectiveness in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.","Moutaouakkil, Youssef; Tadlaoui, Yasmina; Latt, Esso Eric Valery; Atbib, Yassine; Cherrah, Yahia; Bennana, Ahmed; Bousliman, Yassir; Lamsaouri, Jamal",Douleurs : Évaluation - Diagnostic - Traitement,45,28

This protocol is for health needs assessments, our first step in coplanning medical provision in communities with no existing health data. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study includes clinical assessments and rapid anthropological assessment procedures (RAP) exploring the health needs and perspectives of partner communities in two areas, conducted over 6 weeks fieldwork. First, in Wanang village (population c.200), which is set in lowland rainforest. Second, in six communities (population c.3000) along an altitudinal transect up the highest mountain in PNG, Mount Wilhelm. Individual primary care assessments incorporate physical examinations and questioning (providing qualitative and quantitative data) while RAP includes focus groups, interviews and field observations (providing qualitative data). Given absence of in-community primary care, treatments are offered alongside research activity but will not form part of the study. Data are collected by a research fellow, primary care clinician and two PNG research technicians. After quantitative and qualitative analyses, we will report: ethnoclassifications of disease, causes, symptoms and perceived appropriate treatment; community rankings of disease importance and service needs; attitudes regarding health service provision; disease burdens and associations with altitudinal-related variables and cultural practices. To aid wider use study tools are in online supplemental file, and paper and ODK versions are available free from the corresponding author. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Challenges include supporting informed consent in communities with low literacy and diverse cultures, moral duties to provide treatment alongside research in medically underserved areas while minimising risks of therapeutic misconception and inappropriate inducement, and PNG research capacity building. Brighton and Sussex Medical School (UK), PNG Institute of Medical Research and PNG Medical Research Advisory Committee have approved the study.

Hence, further research is necessary to seek possible therapeutic targets in the CNS for effective management of these complications. AREAS COVERED: This review examines the neurological complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections and the possible routes of infection. It progresses to illuminate the possible therapeutic targets for effective management of these neuromodulatory effects and the repurposing of drugs that could serve this purpose. To this end, literature from the year 1998–2021 was derived from PubMed. EXPERT OPINION: The neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 may be related to poor prognosis and higher comorbidity. Identification of the key molecular targets in the brain that are potential indicators of the observed neuropathology, such as inflammatory mediators and chromatin modifiers, is key. The repurposing of existing drugs to target potential candidates could reduce the mortality attributed to these associated neurological complications.","Kumar, Sonali; Shanker, Ozasvi R; Kumari, Neeraj; Tripathi, Manjari; Chandra, P Sarat; Dixit, Aparna Banerjee; Banerjee, Jyotirmoy",Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,45,16

This behaviour results from a complex combination of factors, including social ones, which lead to significant differences in the evolution of the spatiotemporal pattern between and within countries. Usually, spatial smoothing techniques are used to map health outcomes, and rarely uncertainty of the spatial predictions are assessed. As an alternative, we propose to apply direct block sequential simulation to model the spatial distribution of the COVID-19 infection risk in mainland Portugal. Given the daily number of infection data provided by the Portuguese Directorate-General for Health, the daily updates of infection rates are calculated by municipality and used as experimental data in the geostatistical simulation. The model considers the uncertainty/error associated with the size of each municipality’s population. The calculation of daily updates of the infection risk maps results from the median model of one ensemble of 100 geostatistical realizations of daily updates of the infection risk. The ensemble of geostatistical realizations is also used to calculate the associated spatial uncertainty of the spatial prediction using the interquartile distance. The risk maps are updated daily and show the regions with greater risks of infection and the critical dynamics related to its development over time.","Azevedo, Leonardo; Pereira, Maria João; Ribeiro, Manuel C.; Soares, Amílcar",Int J Health Geogr,45,12
