6698,Surfactant replacement therapy for non-respiratory distress syndrome neonatal respiratory disease —research or clinical application?,1995,"The immune system is involved in host defense against infectious agents, tumor cells, and environmental insults. Inflammation is an important component of the early immunologic response. Inappropriate or dysfunctional immune responses underlie acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. The n−6 PUFA arachidonic acid (AA) is the precursor of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and related compounds that have important roles in inflammation and in the regulation of immunity. Feeding fish oil results in partial replacement of AA in cell membranes by EPA. This leads to decreased production of AA-derived mediators, through several mechanisms, including decreased availability of AA, competition for cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes, and decreased expression of COX-2 and 5-LOX. This alone is a potentially beneficial anti-inflammatory effect of n−3 FA. However, n−3 FA have a number of other effects that might occur down-stream of altered eicosanoid production or might be independent of this effect. For example, dietary fish oil results in suppressed production of proinflammatory cytokines and can modulate adhesion molecule expression. These effects occur at the level of altered gene expression. Fish oil feeding has been shown to ameliorate the symptoms of some animal models of autoimmune disease and to protect against the effects of endotoxin. Clinical studies have reported that oral fish oil supplementation has beneficial effects in rheumatoid arthritis and among some asthmatics, supporting the idea that the n−3 FA in fish oil are anti-inflammatory. There are indications that the inclusion of fish oil in enteral and parenteral formulae is beneficial to patients.","Calder, Philip C.",Lipids,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101988/,515

14166,The efficacy of mesenchymal stromal cell-derived therapies for acute respiratory distress syndrome—a meta-analysis of preclinical trials,2020-11-20,"Sheep farming is the backbone of a rural economy in developing countries, and haemonchosis is a major impediment in the way of its progress. Haemonchus contortus (H. contortus) infection persists all over the world particularly in the tropical and sub-tropical regions. Various review articles have been published to substantially cover one or more aspects of its morphology, prevalence, pathogenesis, symptoms, diagnosis, immune response, drug resistance, treatment, and control measure. The objective of this paper is to briefly review past and present information available in the aforementioned areas in one place to enable the readers to fully understand the problem from a broader perspective. H. contortus parasite harbours in abomasum of affected animal and feeds on its blood, producing mild to severe symptoms and even death in acute form. The parasite thus inflicts heavy production losses and is of economic importance. H. contortus has developed diverse characters over the years leading to limited success in the production of vaccines. Indiscriminate use of the anthelmintics has produced drug resistance against almost all conventional products. Efficacy of medicinal plants and non-conventional chemicals has been reported under controlled experiments; however, research on their adverse effects on growth and fertility is yet to be studied. Research on molecular tools for identification and introduction of resistant genes into the flock is also underway but still a long journey to find its field application. Crossbreeding may compromise the production traits of the existing flock. In given circumstances, a targeted selective treatment approach along with selective breeding, culling of more susceptible animals, and maintaining a good body condition score through the provision of a balanced diet remains a workable strategy to control haemonchosis in sheep.","Naeem, Muhammad; Iqbal, Zahid; Roohi, Nabila",Trop Anim Health Prod,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7677603/,515

We propose a model based on the estimation of two-parameter Weibull distribution conditionally to the features. To achieve this result, we describe a neural network architecture and the associated loss functions that takes into account the right-censored data. We extend the approach to a finite mixture of two-parameter Weibull distributions. We first validate that our model is able to precisely estimate the right parameters of the conditional Weibull distribution on synthetic datasets. In numerical experiments on two real-word datasets (METABRIC and SEER), our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate that our approach can consider any survival time horizon.","Bennis, Achraf; Mouysset, Sandrine; Serrurier, Mathieu",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206189/,515

37176,Antineoplastics: Coronavirus disease-2019: case report,2020-07-25,"The demand for safe, high-quality food has greatly increased, in recent times. As traditional thermal pasteurization can significantly impact the nutritional value and the color of fresh food, an increasing number of nonthermal pasteurization technologies have attracted attention. The bactericidal effect of high-pressure carbon dioxide has been known for many years, and its effect on food-related enzymes has been studied. This novel technology has many merits, owing to its use of relatively low pressures and temperatures, which make it a potentially valuable future method for nonthermal pasteurization. For example, the inactivation of polyphenol oxidase can be achieved with relatively low temperature and pressure, and this can contribute to food quality and better preserve nutrients, such as vitamin C. However, this novel technology has yet to be developed on an industrial scale due to insufficient test data. In order to support the further development of this application, on an industrial scale, we have reviewed the existing information on high-pressure carbon dioxide pasteurization technology. We include its bactericidal effects and its influence on food quality. We also pave the way for future studies, by highlighting key areas.","Yu, Tonghuan; Niu, Liyuan; Iwahashi, Hitoshi",Food Eng Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7373338/,515
37993,Relative bradycardia in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020-08-18,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease involving joint and bone damage that is mediated in part by proteases and cytokines produced by synovial macrophages and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). Although current biological therapeutic strategies for RA have been effective in many cases, new classes of therapeutics are needed. We investigated anti-inflammatory properties of the natural alkaloid tryptanthrin (TRYP) and its synthetic derivative tryptanthrin-6-oxime (TRYP-Ox). Both TRYP and TRYP-Ox inhibited matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 gene expression in interleukin (IL)-1β-stimulated primary human FLS, as well as IL-1β–induced secretion of MMP-1/3 by FLS and synovial SW982 cells and IL-6 by FLS, SW982 cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and monocytic THP-1 cells, although TRYP-Ox was generally more effective and had no cytotoxicity in vitro. Evaluation of the therapeutic potential of TRYP and TRYP-Ox in vivo in murine arthritis models showed that both compounds significantly attenuated the development of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and collagen-antibody–induced arthritis (CAIA), with comparable efficacy. Collagen II (CII)-specific antibody levels were similarly reduced in TRYP- and TRYP-Ox-treated CIA mice. TRYP and TRYP-Ox also suppressed proinflammatory cytokine production by lymph node cells from CIA mice, with TRYP-Ox being more effective in inhibiting IL-17A, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL). Thus, even though TRYP-Ox generally had a better in vitro profile, possibly due to its ability to inhibit c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), both TRYP and TRYP-Ox were equally effective in inhibiting the clinical symptoms and damage associated with RA. Overall, TRYP and/or TRYP-Ox may represent potential new directions for the pursuit of novel treatments for RA.","Kirpotina, Liliya N.; Schepetkin, Igor A.; Hammaker, Deepa; Kuhs, Amanda; Khlebnikov, Andrei I.; Quinn, Mark T.",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7394103/,515

What is less clear, however, is the degree to which these aggregate changes are driven by firm choices at the extensive (whether to invest) or intensive (how much to invest) margins. Further, there is little evidence on the way in which these two margins are affected by firm and home-country characteristics. We contribute by examining firm-level cross-border investments during 2007–2015 into Europe from a broad group of home countries at both investment margins. Similar to the existing single-country studies, we find that taxes operate primarily on the extensive margin. Building on those results, we delve further and find significant variation across firms with small investors from high-tax home countries especially sensitive to host taxation.

44146,363. Acute Kidney Injury and Renal Replacement Therapy in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients in the United States and Other Geographic Regions,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: As the COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to unfold, drastic changes in daily life pose significant challenges on mental and clinical health. While public health interventions such as national lockdowns and social distancing are enforced to reduce the spread of COVID-19, the psychosocial and physical consequences have yet to be determined that may disproportionately affect people living with HIV (PLWH). METHODS: To evaluate the impact of COVID-related stress on mental and clinical health, we conducted a 20-minute questionnaire eliciting sociodemographic information, clinical and psychological factors from people living in Miami, Fl. All individuals >18 years with or without a history of COVID-19 were included. Participating PLWH were recruited from an existing HIV registry and HIV uninfected participants from community flyers and word of mouth. RESULTS: A total of 135 participants were recruited from 05/2020-06/2020. The mean age was 50 years old, 73/135 (54%) were female, and 102/135 (75%) were PLWH. Among participating PLWH, 60/102 (58.8%) self-identified as African American, and 9/102 (8.8%) were positive for COVID-19 by a commercially approved test. Among HIV-negative participants, 15/33 (45.5%) self-identified as White and 11/33 (33%) were positive for COVID-19. Both PLWH and HIV-negative participants described significant disruptions in health care access (47%), difficulty paying basic needs (41%), and feelings of anxiety and depression (48%); there was no statistically significant difference by HIV status. However, HIV negative participants were less likely to experience job loss and income disruption compared to PLWH during the pandemic (70% for HIV-negative vs 48% for PLWH; OR 0.40, p=0.03). CONCLUSION: The impact of COVID-19 on emotional and clinical health is significant in both PLWH and HIV-negative groups. These findings highlight the need for providing mental and physical health care during the pandemic, especially for coping with stress and anxiety during these difficult times and ensuring adequate access to health care.

44800,Sintilimab: Aggravation of Coronavirus disease 2019: case report,2021-01-23,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Giant cell arteritis (GCA), a medium and large vessel vasculitis occurring in the aged, remains a formidable disease, capable of taking both vision and life, through a multitude of vascular complications. Our understanding of the spectrum of its manifestations has grown over the years, to include limb claudication, aortitis, and cardiac disease, in addition to the more classic visual complications resulting from of ischemia to branches of the external and internal carotid arteries. While a clinical presentation of headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, fever and other systemic symptoms and serum markers are together highly suggestive of the disease, diagnosis can be challenging in those cases in which classic symptoms are lacking. The purpose of this review is to update the reader on advances in the diagnosis and treatment of giant cell arteritis and to review our evolving understanding of the immunological mechanism underlying the disease, which have helped guide our search for novel therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: There is increasing evidence supporting the use of Doppler ultrasound, dedicated post-contrast T1-weighted spin echo MRI of the scalp arteries and PET scan, which can together improve our diagnostic accuracy in cases in which temporal artery biopsy is either inconclusive or not feasible. Advances in our understanding of the immunological cascades underlying the disease have helped guide our search for steroid-sparing treatments for the GCA, the most important of which has been the IL-6 receptor antibody inhibitor tocilizumab, which has been shown to reduce cumulative steroid dose in a large multicenter, placebo-controlled prospective study. Other biologic agents, such as abatacept and ustekinumab have shown promise in smaller studies. SUMMARY: GCA is no longer a disease whose diagnosis is based exclusively on temporal artery biopsy and whose complications are prevented solely with the use of corticosteroids. Modern vascular imaging techniques and targeted immunologic therapies are heralding a new era for the disease, in which practitioners will hopefully be able to diagnosis it with greater accuracy and treat it with less ischemic complications and iatrogenic side effects.","Dinkin, Marc; Johnson, Editha",Curr Treat Options Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7811148/,515

51802,Intravenous immunoglobulins: A therapeutic alternative to consider in kidney transplant patients with COVID-19(),2021-04-22,"The United Nations’ World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) states that “it is necessary to respect the host community’s socio-cultural authenticity and protect cultural heritage and traditional values” to facilitate sustainable tourism development. Sustainable Tourism Indicators (STI:2004) show that sustainable tourism development promotes economic, social, environmental, and cultural sustainability. Therefore, it is essential to understand the resident situational context and safeguard “the happiness in the society that hosts tourism”. Tourism that uses cultural heritage as a selling point includes ethnic tourism. Cultural heritage and traditional values are attractive sales resources for generating tourism revenue. This point may be detrimental to the residents because they damage the culture and traditions in multiple economic, social, and cultural aspects of economic, social, and cultural. Ethnic tourism must be sustainable without destroying the local culture and traditions. This study aims to analyze whether the requirements for sustainable tourism development that the UNWTO outlined met by the ethnic tourism that Bali develop. Ethnic tourism has grown in Bali since it first began in the 1970s; many tourists have visited the region and have been deeply impressed by its traditional arts and crafts and hope to bring them back. This phenomenon has generated an immense demand for taking home back pieces of traditional Balinese art and crafts and bolster the mass production of traditional art and crafts sold as souvenirs to tourists. Regarding this situation, positive and negative effects on the culture and traditions of the region by over-tourism through ethnic tourism need to be determined. This study focused on traditional Balinese sculptures and paintings and conducted surveys to examine the consciousness of craftsmen involved in traditional crafts to reveal the influences of tourism on traditional culture in Bali. The hypothesis of this study was as follows: Ethnic tourism that attempts to sell traditional culture to the tourist does not satisfy the requirements for the development of sustainable tourism development leading to happiness in the society hosting the tourism. As a preliminary survey, I planned interviews to obtain the craftsmen's opinions and to devise questions for subsequent questionnaires. I conducted the interviews with craftsmen in August 2019 (n = 4). Subsequently, I conducted the questionnaire survey for craftsmen (wood-carving and painting) in August and September 2019 and January 2020 (n = 103). The questionnaires were analyzed using simple tabulation, comparison of means, factor analysis, and multiple regression analysis. Additionally, as a survey to understand customers’ needs concerning traditional culture, I conducted an interview survey for tourists in August 2019. This survey sought to identify why they purchased wood-carvings and paintings (n = 9). These surveys showed that nearly half of the craftsmen involved in traditional crafts lost their employment because of ethnic tourism. The hypothesis was verified because the situation did not achieve sustainability for maintaining the livelihoods of the craftsmen, who also play a role in the transmission of traditional culture. It was unclear whether the life with ethnic tourism that eliminated their position would lead to happiness.","Mayuzumi, Yoko",Asia-Pac J Reg Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8051284/,515

Although substantial ISL research has documented short-term outcomes such as the learning that takes place during a science center visit, research suggests that the genuine benefits of informal experiences are long-term transformations in learners as they pursue a “cascade” of experiences subsequent to the initial educational event. However, a number of major methodological challenges have limited longitudinal research projects investigating the long-term effects of ISL experiences. In this paper we identify and address four key issues surrounding the critical but challenging area of how to study and measure the long-term effects or impacts of ISL experiences: attribution, attrition, data collection, and analytic approaches. Our objective is to provide guidance to ISL researchers wishing to engage in long-term investigations of learner outcomes and to begin a dialogue about how best to address the numerous challenges involved in this work.","Staus, Nancy L.; Falk, John H.; Price, Aaron; Tai, Robert H.; Dierking, Lynn D.",Discip Interdscip Sci Educ Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8090518/,515

CASE A 3-year-old boy had had an enlarged head since infancy. Magnetic resonance (MR) images on admission showed a strikingly enhanced mass lesion, 6 cm in size. A 4-vessel CAG demonstrated a hyper-vascular mass with an AV shunt. After transarterial embolization, the patient underwent total excision of the mass. The tumor bled easily, during surgery the patient lost 400 cm3 in blood. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma. CONCLUSION The differential diagnosis of intraparenchymal, strikingly-enhanced tumors with an AV shunt include hyper-vascular GCMs. Consideration of potential for bleeding during the operation is also important.","Hirata, Koji; Ihara, Satoshi; Sato, Masayuki; Matsumaru, Yuji; Yamamoto, Tetsuya",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00381-016-3234-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27585994/,515

To avoid the invasiveness of CPB, off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) is currently also used. In Japan, in particular, OPCAB now accounts for 60 % of all CABG operations and has become a standard surgical procedure. We herein provide a discussion of OPCAB. The goals of coronary artery bypass surgery are to achieve complete revascularization and maintain a high rate of graft patency for the long term. This requires stable exposure of the coronary arteries, including those located on the posterior surface of the heart and the formation of good-quality anastomoses. Achieving this depends not only on the competency of the individual surgeon, but also on smooth and effective teamwork among everyone involved, including the other surgeons, anesthetists, clinical technicians, and nurses. It is important for surgeons and surgical teams to examine their own outcomes and engage in self-scrutiny in an endeavor to improve these outcomes.","Tashiro, Tadashi; Wada, Hideichi; Nishimi, Masaru; Minematsu, Noritoshi",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11748-013-0240-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23775231/,515

Despite the rise of digital education in health professional education (HPE), little is known about the comparative effectiveness of paper-based reading and its digital alternative on reading comprehension in HPE. We aimed to identify, appraise, and synthesize the evidence regarding the effect of reading media on reading comprehension in the context of HPE.Findings. From a pool of 2,208 references, we included 10 controlled studies enrolling 817 participants. Meta-analyses revealed a non-statistically significant advantage of paper over digital reading (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.08; 95% confidence interval -0.28 to 0.12). Subgroup analyses revealed that students reading HPE-related texts, rather than non-HPE-related texts, had better reading comprehension when reading on paper (SMD = -0.36; 95% confidence interval -0.69 to -0.03). Heterogeneity was low in all analyses. The quality of evidence was low due to risks of bias across studies.Summary. Current evidence suggests little to no difference between paper and digital texts for reading comprehension in HPE. However, we observed effects favoring paper-based reading when considering texts relevant to students' professional discipline. Rigorous studies are needed to confirm this finding and to evaluate new means of boosting reading comprehension in HPE.","Fontaine, Guillaume; Zagury-Orly, Ivry; Maheu-Cadotte, Marc-André; Lapierre, Alexandra; Thibodeau-Jarry, Nicolas; Denus, Simon de; Lordkipanidzé, Marie; Dupont, Patrice; Lavoie, Patrick",American journal of pharmaceutical education,https://doi.org/10.5688/ajpe8525; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34301544/,515

We then assessed whether this association is modified by disability status. METHODS We used three waves of cohort data from the Longitudinal Surveys of Australian Youth. We fitted logistic regression models to account for confounders of the relationship between labour force status (employed, not in the labour force, unemployed and having problems looking for work) at age 21 years and psychological distress at age 22 years. We then estimated whether this association was modified by disability status at age 21 years. RESULTS Being unemployed and having problems looking for work at age 21 years was associated with odds of psychological distress that were 2.48 (95% CI 1.95 to 3.14) times higher than employment. There was little evidence for additive effect measure modification of this association by disability status (2.52, 95% CI -1.21 to 6.25). CONCLUSIONS Young people who were unemployed and having problems looking for work had increased odds of poor mental health. Interventions should focus on addressing the difficulties young people report when looking for work, with a particular focus on supporting those young people facing additional barriers to employment such as young people with disabilities.","Shields, Marissa; Dimov, Stefanie; King, Tania L; Milner, Allison; Kavanagh, Anne; Spittal, Matthew J; Disney, George",Occupational and environmental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2020-107149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33303687/,515

Most patients appear to have mild influenza-like illness and many of the complications leading to hospitalization and mortality occur in those with underlying disease conditions or pregnancy.

Medical tourism is a rising global phenomenon that is strongly dependent on innovation and knowledge management. Being both innovative and systematic in medical tourism requires thought enrichment in knowledge management in hospitals. By applying a quantitative method, ""knowledge management-oriented innovation"" items have been used in this study to analyze new products or services related to active hospitals in medical tourism in Iran.

Background The activity of the rotator cuff muscles has not previously been measured with indwelling electromyography (EMG) comparing ambulation and other movements. Knowledge of the relative contribution of these muscles during various tasks may help to guide rehabilitation progression. Objective To measure activity of the rotator cuff muscles and other shoulder muscles during normal ambulation, shirt and sling donning and doffing, and rehabilitation tasks commonly performed after rotator cuff surgery. Methods In 28 volunteers (15 men, 13 women; mean age, 32.2 years), indwelling EMG activity was measured in the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis muscles during various tasks; and surface EMG activity was measured in the middle deltoid, biceps, and upper trapezius muscles. Results Using median EMG activity, in general, donning and doffing a shirt or sling recruited the rotator cuff muscles more than the other 7 tasks tested. Self-ranging motion using pulleys, especially in the scapular plane, was also consistently associated with greater recruitment of the shoulder muscles. Pendulum exercises, passive range of motion by a physical therapist, and self-ranging motion with a dowel recruited the shoulder muscles to a lesser extent. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that rehabilitation tasks such as pendulum exercises, passive range of motion by a physical therapist, and self-ranging motion with a dowel show low EMG activity, whereas pulleys in the sagittal plane and scapular plane show greater activity. Scapular plane activity was consistently higher than sagittal plane activity. Of all the tasks assessed, ambulation without a sling and donning and doffing a sling and a shirt consistently showed the highest activity. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2016;46(5):375-383.

METHODS Between 2010 and 2011, 26 patients (21 men; mean age 67 years) with symptomatic vertebral artery ostial stenosis >60% were treated. Under distal filter protection, a 0.014-inch guidewire was introduced in the ipsilateral subclavian artery as the marker wire for the Szabo technique. The balloon-expandable paclitaxel-embedded Yinyi stent was mounted on the filter's guidewire in a monorail configuration. One strut segment only of the last stent cell was gently flared by forceps, and the outer end of the marker wire was introduced through the flared strut of the stent. The lifted strut was then crimped back into place. Holding the two wires together, the stent/balloon system was gently advanced into the ostial lesion until the marker wire stopped advancing and resistance was appreciated. The stent was deployed at 6 atmospheres, after which the balloon was deflated to 2 to 4 atmospheres, the marker wire was withdrawn, and the stent was postdilated at a high pressure (10-12 atmospheres) after withdrawing the balloon one half to one third outside of the stent to ensure that the protruding strut was flush against the wall of the subclavian artery. RESULTS The technical success rate was 100% with accurate stent deployment. The mean degree of stenosis reduced from 84.5%±6.1% to 6.2%±3.1%. Symptoms were resolved in 20 cases and were improved in 6 cases with prior stroke. No obvious in-stent restenosis was revealed by imaging at 12.0±2.2 months. No procedure-related stroke or transient ischemic attacks occurred at a follow-up for 24.0±3.7 months. CONCLUSION The Szabo technique is safe and effective in guiding accurate placement of the Yinyi stent at the vertebral artery ostium, which may help lower restenosis rates.","Tang, Feng; Wang, Qian; Hu, Chang; Li, Pei; Li, Lei",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1583/13-4298.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23914867/,515

Our objective was to examine anastomotic leak and stricture with DST for esophagoenteric anastomosis in gastric cancer patients. METHODS A single institution review was performed for patients who underwent total/proximal gastrectomy with DST between 2006 and 2015. DST was performed using transoral anvil delivery (OrVil) with end-to-end anastomosis. Clinical characteristics and outcomes, including anastomotic leak and stricture, were recorded. RESULTS Overall, DST was performed in 60 patients [total gastrectomy (81.7%, n = 49/60), proximal gastrectomy (10.0%, n = 6/60), and completion gastrectomy (8.3%, n = 5/60)]. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 21 patients (35.0%), and 6 patients (10.0%) received external beam radiation therapy prior to completion gastrectomy. Operative approach was open (51.7%, n = 31/60), laparoscopic (43.3%, n = 26/60), or robotic (5.0%, n = 3/60). Anastomotic leak occurred in 6.7% (n = 4/60), while stricture independent of leak was identified in 19.0% (n = 11/58) of patients. Complications occurred in 38.3% (n = 23/60) of patients, of which 52% were classified as Clavien-Dindo grades III-V complications. CONCLUSION In the largest Western series of DST for esophagoenteric anastomoses in gastric cancer surgery, our experience demonstrates that DST is safe and effective with low rates of leak and stricture.","Choi, Audrey H; Arrington, Amanda; Falor, Ann; Nelson, Rebecca A; Lew, Michael; Chao, Joseph; Lee, Byrne; Kim, Joseph",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-016-3087-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26831060/,515

Although some institutions have maintained their traditional requirements, others have accelerated their programs to rush nearly graduated trainees to the front lines. One interpretation of the unplanned shortening of the duration of training programs during a crisis is that standards have been lowered. But it is also possible that these trainees were examined according to the same standards as usual and were judged to have already met them. This paper discusses the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the current workforce, provides an analysis of how competency-based medical education (CBME) in the context of the pandemic might have mitigated wide-scale disruption, and identifies structural barriers to achieving an ideal state. The paper further calls upon universities, health centres, governments, certifying bodies, regulatory authorities, and health care professionals to work collectively on a truly time-variable model of CBME. The pandemic has made clear that time variability in medical education already exists and should be adopted widely and formally. If our systems today had used a framework of outcome competencies, sequenced progression, tailored learning, focused instruction, and programmatic assessment, we may have been even more nimble in changing our systems to care for our patients with COVID-19.","Caretta-Weyer, Holly A; Chan, Teresa; Bigham, Blair L; Kinnear, Benjamin; Huwendiek, Sören; Schumacher, Daniel J",Medical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2021.1925641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34027813/,515

For the first time, the impact of different dissociation species (cationic, zwitterionic and anionic forms) of ciprofloxacin (CIP) on its photocatalytic transformation fate was systematically studied in a UVA/LED/TiO2 system. The dissociation forms of CIP at different pH affected the photocatalytic degradation kinetics, transformation products (TPs) formation as well as degradation pathways. Zwitterionic form of CIP exhibited the highest degradation rate constant (0.2217 ± 0.0179 min-1), removal efficiency of total organic carbon (TOC) and release of fluoride ion (F-). Time-dependent evolution profiles on TPs revealed that the cationic and anionic forms of CIP mainly underwent piperazine ring dealkylation, while zwitterionic CIP primarily proceeded through defluorination and piperazine ring oxidation. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculation based on Fukui index well interpreted the active sites of different CIP species. Potential energy surface (PES) analysis further elucidated the reaction transition state (TS) evolution and energy barrier (ΔEb) for CIP with different dissociation species after radical attack. This study provides deep insights into degradation mechanisms of emerging organic contaminants in advanced oxidation processes associated to their chemical speciation.","Li, Si; Huang, Taobo; Du, Penghui; Liu, Wen; Hu, Jiangyong",Water research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.116286; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818732/,515

In this paper, we investigated the reproductive toxicity of these pollutants using a C. elegans model to evaluate spermatogenesis throughout the entire developmental cycle of him-5 mutant by exposing to 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 mmol/L PFOS or PFOA for 48 h. Experimental results suggested that PFOS and PFOA exposure led to reductions in brood size, germ cell number, spermatid size, and motility, and increases in rate of malformation spermatids. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that exposure to PFOS resulted in higher levels of damage than PFOA in germ cells only in 0.001 mmol/L exposure group. RT-qPCR was used to further investigate the expression of genes associated with different stages of spermatogenesis, such as mitosis and meiosis, fibrous body-membranous organelles (FB-MOs), and sperm activation. The expression levels of wee-1.3, spe-4, spe-6, and spe-17 genes were increased, while those of puf-8, spe-10, fer-1, swm-1, try-5, and spe-15 genes were decreased. Our results suggesting that PFOS or PFOA may cause spermatogenesis damage by disrupting the mitotic proliferation, meiotic entry, formation of the MOs, fusion of the MOs and plasma membrane (PM), and pseudopods. Loss-of-function studies using puf-8 and spe-10 mutants revealed spe-10 gene was specifically involved in PFOS- or PFOA-induced reproductive toxicity via regulating one or more critical palmitoylation events, while puf-8 gene was not direct target of PFOS and PFOA, and PFOS and PFOA may act on the upstream gene of puf-8, thus affecting reproductive ability. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential adverse impact of PFOS and PFOA exposure on spermatogenesis and provide valuable data for PFC risk assessment.

We explored in a real-world sample of EVT patients if a clinical-ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) mismatch was associated with an outcome benefit after late EVT. MethodsWe retrospectively analysed all consecutive AIS patients admitted 6-24 hours after last proof of good health in two stroke centres, with initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) â¥10 and an internal carotid artery or M1 occlusion. We defined clinical-ASPECTS mismatch as NIHSSâ¥10 and ASPECTSâ¥7, or NIHSSâ¥20 and ASPECTSâ¥5. We assessed the interaction between clinical-ASPECTS mismatch positive and negative patients and late EVT, using ordinal shift analysis of the 3-month modified Rankin Scale and adjusting for multiple confounders.ResultsThe included 337 patients had a median age of 73 years (IQR=61-82), admission NIHSS of 18 (15-22) and baseline ASPECTS of 7 (5-9). Out of 196 (58.2%) patients showing clinical-ASPECTS mismatch, 146 (74.5%) underwent late EVT. Among 141 (41.8%) mismatch negative patients, late EVT was performed in 72 (51.1%) patients. In the adjusted analysis, late EVT was significantly associated with a better outcome in the presence of clinical-ASPECTS mismatch (adjusted Odd Ratio, aOR=2.83; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.48-5.58) but not in its absence (aOR=1.32; 95%CI: 0.61-2.84). The p-value for the interaction term between clinical-ASPECTS mismatch and late EVT was 0.073. ConclusionsIn our retrospective two-site analysis, late EVT seemed effective in the presence of a clinical-ASPECTS mismatch, but not in its absence. If confirmed in randomized trials, this finding could support the use of an ASPECTS-based selection for late EVT decisions, obviating the need for advanced imaging.","Nannoni, Stefania; Kaesmacher, Johannes; Ricciardi, Federico; Strambo, Davide; Dunet, Vincent; Hajdu, Steven; Saliou, Guillaume; Mordasini, Pasquale; Hakim, Arsany; Arnold, Marcel; Gralla, Jan; Fischer, Urs; Michel, Patrik",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/17474930211009806; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33787411/,515

Imaging-based selection may identify a cohort with a favorable response to endovascular therapy, in an even later time window. AIMS We performed an indirect comparison between outcomes seen in DEFUSE 2, a prospective cohort study of patients who received a baseline MRI before endovascular therapy, and a control group from AXIS 2 receiving standard medical care up to 12 h after symptom onset. METHODS Patients from AXIS 2 with a confirmed large vessel occlusion were selected as a control group for DEFUSE 2-patients. The primary endpoint was good functional outcome at day 90 (Modified Rankin Score 0-2). We performed a stratified analysis based on the presence of the target mismatch for both studies and reperfusion status in DEFUSE 2. RESULTS We compared good functional outcome in 108 patients from AXIS 2 and 99 patients from DEFUSE 2. In DEFUSE 2-patients with the target mismatch profile in whom reperfusion was achieved, the rate of good functional outcome was increased compared to target mismatch patients in AXIS 2, 54% versus 29% (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.1-9.4). In target mismatch patients treated between 6 and 12 h after stroke onset, this association between study and good functional outcome remained present (OR 9.0, 95% CI 1.1-75.8). CONCLUSIONS This indirect comparison suggests that endovascular treatment resulting in substantial reperfusion is associated with improved outcome in target mismatch patients even beyond 6 h after stroke onset. Confirmation is needed from future clinical trials that randomize patients beyond the 6 h time window.","Wouters, Anke; Lemmens, Robin; Christensen, Soren; Wilms, Guido; Dupont, Patrick; Mlynash, Michael; Schneider, Armin; Laage, Rico; Cereda, Carlo W; Lansberg, Maarten G; Albers, Gregory W; Thijs, Vincent",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/1747493015607503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26763028/,515

International recommendations for the control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic emphasize the central role of laboratory testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent, at scale. The availability of testing reagents, laboratory equipment and qualified staff are important bottlenecks to achieving this. Elsewhere, pooled testing (i.e. combining multiple samples in the same reaction) has been suggested to increase testing capacities in the pandemic period. Methods. We discuss our experience with SARS-CoV-2 pooled testing using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on the Kenyan Coast. Results. In mid-May, 2020, our RT-PCR testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 was improved by ~100% as a result of adoption of a six-sample pooled testing strategy. This was accompanied with a concomitant saving of ~50% of SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test kits at both the RNA extraction and RT-PCR stages. However, pooled testing came with a slight decline of test sensitivity. The RT-PCR cycle threshold value (ΔCt) was ~1.59 higher for samples tested in pools compared to samples tested singly. Conclusions. Pooled testing is a useful strategy to increase SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing capacity especially in low-income settings.","Agoti, Charles N; Mutunga, Martin; Lambisia, Arnold W; Kimani, Domtila; Cheruiyot, Robinson; Kiyuka, Patience; Lewa, Clement; Gicheru, Elijah; Tendwa, Metrine; Said Mohammed, Khadija; Osoti, Victor; Makale, Johnstone; Tawa, Brian; Odundo, Calleb; Cheruiyot, Wesley; Nyamu, Wilfred; Gumbi, Wilson; Mwacharo, Jedidah; Nyamako, Lydia; Otieno, Edward; Amadi, David; Thoya, Janet; Karani, Angela; Mugo, Daisy; Musyoki, Jennifer; Gumba, Horace; Mwarumba, Salim; M Gichuki, Bonface; Njuguna, Susan; Riako, Debra; Mutua, Shadrack; Gitonga, John N; Sein, Yiakon; Bartilol, Brian; Mwangi, Shaban J; O Omuoyo, Donwilliams; M Morobe, John; de Laurent, Zaydah R; Bejon, Philip; Ochola-Oyier, Lynette Isabella; Tsofa, Benjamin",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16113.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33134555/,515

Multivariable linear models further assessed each component as a continuous outcome. RESULTS The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 17.7%. Participants with higher MEDLIFE adherence (T3: 11-17 points) had 71% lower odds of having metabolic syndrome compared to those with lower MEDLIFE adherence (T1: 2-7 points) (OR = 0.29; 95%CI: 0.10 to 0.90, p for trend = 0.04). Furthermore, significant inverse associations were found for T3 versus T1 on abdominal obesity (OR = 0.42; 95%CI: 0.18 to 0.99, p for trend = 0.07) and hypertriglyceridemia (OR = 0.24; 95%CI: 0.09 to 0.63, p for trend = 0.002). Significant inverse associations for continuous outcomes included total-cholesterol (total-c), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and total-c:high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (p for trend <0.05). CONCLUSION Higher adherence to traditional Mediterranean lifestyle habits, as measured by a comprehensive MEDLIFE index, was associated with a lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome and a more favorable cardiometabolic profile in a non-Mediterranean working population. Future studies employing the MEDLIFE index in other populations are warranted to support this hypothesis.","Hershey, Maria S; Sotos-Prieto, Mercedes; Ruiz-Canela, Miguel; Christophi, Costas A; Moffatt, Steven; Martínez-González, Miguel Ángel; Kales, Stefanos N",Clinical nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.03.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932793/,515

As patients potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 need to visit hospitals, the incidence of nosocomial infection can be expected to be high. Therefore, a comprehensive and objective understanding of nosocomial infection is needed to guide the prevention and control of the epidemic. Methods We searched major international and Chinese databases: Medicine, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, CBM (China Biology Medicine disc), CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) and Wanfang database for case series or case reports on nosocomial infections of COVID-19, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndromes) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) from their inception to March 31st, 2020. We conducted a meta-analysis of the proportion of nosocomial infection patients in the diagnosed patients, occupational distribution of nosocomial infection medical staff. Results We included 40 studies. Among the confirmed patients, the proportions of nosocomial infections with early outbreaks of COVID-19, SARS, and MERS were 44.0%, 36.0%, and 56.0%, respectively. Of the confirmed patients, the medical staff and other hospital-acquired infections accounted for 33.0% and 2.0% of COVID-19 cases, 37.0% and 24.0% of SARS cases, and 19.0% and 36.0% of MERS cases, respectively. Nurses and doctors were the most affected among the infected medical staff. The mean numbers of secondary cases caused by one index patient were 29.3 and 6.3 for SARS and MERS, respectively. Conclusions The proportion of nosocomial infection in patients with COVID-19 was 44% in the early outbreak. Patients attending hospitals should take personal protection. Medical staff should be awareness of the disease to protect themselves and the patients.","Zhou, Qi; Gao, Yelei; Wang, Xingmei; Liu, Rui; Du, Peipei; Wang, Xiaoqing; Zhang, Xianzhuo; Lu, Shuya; Wang, Zijun; Shi, Qianling; Li, Weiguo; Ma, Yanfang; Luo, Xufei; Fukuoka, Toshio; Ahn, Hyeong Sik; Lee, Myeong Soo; Liu, Enmei; Chen, Yaolong; Luo, Zhengxiu; Yang, Kehu",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-3324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32566566/,515

METHODS A retrospective service evaluation was conducted before and after prospective gating with systolic acquisition replaced retrospectively gated imaging for patients with AF undergoing CTCA at our institution. 25 consecutive patients were examined in each group. The scan parameters and radiation dose information had been collected in a prospective fashion. The image sets were read by blinded, expert readers who rated their diagnostic confidence using a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS The radiation dose received by patients was significantly greater in the retrospectively gated group than those being scanned using prospective gating (21 vs 5.9 mSv, p < 0.01). The prospective gating technique was also associated with greater diagnostic confidence (mean, per-patient score 3.09 vs 3.78, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION Prospective gating with systolic acquisition appears to improve diagnostic confidence at a significantly reduced radiation dose compared with retrospective gating in patients with AF. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE The use of prospective gating with systolic triggering significantly reduces the radiation exposure to patients in AF undergoing CTCA. The same protocol also appears to improve diagnostic confidence.","Clayton, Benjamin; Roobottom, Carl; Morgan-Hughes, Gareth",The British journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20150533; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26337604/,515

126203,Globe Subluxation After Proning in a Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patient.,2021-06-04,"INTRODUCTION Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health emergency. Acne vulgaris is a highly prevalent condition and the dominant role antibiotics play in its treatment is a major concern. Antibiotics are widely used in the treatment of acne predominantly for their anti-inflammatory effect, hence their use in acne may not be optimal. Tetracyclines and macrolides are the two most common oral antibiotic classes prescribed, and their average use can extend from a few months to several years of intermittent or continuous use. The overall aim of this systematic review is to elucidate what is known about oral antibiotics for acne contributing to antibiotic treatment failure and AMR. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic review will be conducted to address the question: What is the existing evidence that long-term oral antibiotics used to treat acne in those over 8 years of age contribute towards antibiotic treatment failure or other outcomes suggestive of the impact of AMR? We will search the following databases: Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science. Search terms will be developed in collaboration with a librarian by identifying keywords from relevant articles and by undertaking pilot searches. Randomised controlled trials, cohort and case-controlled studies conducted in any healthcare setting and published in any language will be included. The searches will be re-run prior to final analyses to capture the recent literature. The Cochrane tool for bias assessment in randomised trials and ROBINS-I for the assessment of bias in non-randomised studies will be used to assess the risk of bias of included studies. GRADE will be used to make an overall assessment of the quality of evidence. A meta-analysis will be undertaken of the outcome measures if the individual studies are sufficiently homogeneous. If a meta-analysis is not possible, a qualitative assessment will be presented as a narrative review. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required for this systematic-review. The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and any deviations from the protocol will be clearly documented in the published manuscript of the full systematic-review.

126732,Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Effects of School Closure for Children and Their Families.,2020-11-23,"OBJECTIVES The objective of the study is to compare excess mortality (EM) patterns and spatial correlation between the first and second wave of the pandemic in Lombardy, the Italian region that paid an extremely high COVID-19-related mortality toll in March and April 2020. STUDY DESIGN We conducted a longitudinal study using municipality-level mortality data. METHODS We investigated the patterns and spatial correlation of EM of men aged ≥75 years during the first two pandemic waves (March-April 2020 vs November 2020) of COVID-19, using the mortality data released by the Italian National Institute of Statistics. EM was estimated at the municipality level to accurately detect the critical areas within the region. RESULTS The areas that were mostly hit during the first wave of COVID-19 were generally spared by the second wave: EM of men aged ≥75 years in the municipality of Bergamo plummeted from +472% in March and April to -13% in November, and in Cremona the variation was from +344% to -19%. Conversely, in November 2020 EM was higher in some areas that had been protected in the first wave of the pandemic. Spatial correlation widely corroborates these findings, as large sections of the hot spots of EM detected in the first wave of the pandemic changed into cold spots in the second wave, and vice versa. CONCLUSIONS Our results reveal the specular distribution of EM between the first and second wave of the pandemic, which may entail the consequences of social distancing measures and individual behaviors, local management strategies, 'harvesting' of the frailer population and, possibly, acquired immune protection. In conclusion, our findings support the need for continuous monitoring and analysis of mortality data using detailed spatial resolution.","Golinelli, D; Lenzi, J; Adja, K Y C; Reno, C; Sanmarchi, F; Fantini, M P; Gibertoni, D",Public health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.03.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33962094/,515

DESIGN Case reports. SETTING A 16 bed pediatric intensive care unit at a tertiary care children's hospital. PATIENTS Two children with life-threatening HHV-6 disease. INTERVENTIONS Both children were mechanically ventilated because of respiratory failure. A detailed viral and immunologic workup was performed and treatment with antiviral medication started. MEASUREMENTS Polymerase chain reaction assays of plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, bronchoalveolar lavage, and lung biopsies yielded HHV-6 in both patients. Immunophenotyping and lymphocyte stimulation tests with both mitogens and antigens indicated an immunodeficiency in both patients. CONCLUSION HHV-6 infection should be considered in infants and young children with respiratory failure or meningo-encephalitis without clear causative agent or failure to respond to empirical treatment. A thorough immunologic workup and early start with antiviral therapy in any patient with a life-threatening course of HHV-6 infection is mandatory, because a severe HHV-6 infection can be the first indication of a primary immunodeficiency.","Hennus, Marije P; van Montfrans, Joris M; van Vught, Adrianus J; Tesselaar, Kiki; Boelens, Jaap-Jan; Jansen, Nicolaas J",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0b013e31819bb956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19265361/,515

METHODS Between April 1995 and August 2010, 189 patients underwent laparoscopic nephroureterectomy, hand-assisted laparoscopic nephroureterectomy, or open nephroureterectomy for upper urinary tract urothelial cancer. Of these patients, 110 with no previous or concurrent bladder cancer or any metastatic disease were included in this study. Cancer-specific survival, recurrence-free survival, and intravesical recurrence-free survival rates were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. The median follow-up period for the cohort was 70 months (range, 6-192 months). RESULTS The 3 groups were well matched for tumor stage, grade, and the presence of lymphovascular invasion and concomitant carcinoma in situ. The estimated 5-year cancer-specific survival rates were 81.1%, 65.6%, and 65.2% for laparoscopic nephroureterectomy, hand-assisted laparoscopic nephroureterectomy, and open nephroureterectomy, respectively (P = .4179). The estimated 5-year recurrence-free survival rates were 33.8%, 10.0%, and 41.2% for laparoscopic nephroureterectomy, hand-assisted laparoscopic nephroureterectomy, and open nephroureterectomy, respectively (P = .0245). The estimated 5-year intravesical recurrence-free survival rates were 64.8%, 10.0%, and 76.2% for laparoscopic nephroureterectomy, hand-assisted laparoscopic nephroureterectomy, and open nephroureterectomy, respectively (P < .0001). CONCLUSION Although there was no significant difference in cancer-specific survival rate among the laparoscopic nephroureterectomy, hand-assisted laparoscopic nephroureterectomy, and open nephroureterectomy groups, hand-assisted laparoscopic nephroureterectomy may be inferior to laparoscopic nephroureterectomy or open nephroureterectomy with regard to recurrence-free survival and intravesical recurrence-free survival rates.","Kitamura, Hiroshi; Maeda, Toshihiro; Tanaka, Toshiaki; Fukuta, Fumimasa; Kobayashi, Ko; Nishiyama, Naotaka; Takahashi, Satoshi; Masumori, Naoya",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680813x13794522666842; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24960495/,515

We recognised the need for alternative teaching methods and identified two key educational areas that required attention: topics related to COVID-19 and its management, and education for doctors being redeployed to other specialties. We developed an innovative method of education delivery to regularly provide high-quality, relevant material to hundreds of healthcare professionals at both hospital sites.

136576,Reporting of coronavirus disease 2019 prognostic models: the transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis statement.,2021-03-01,"UNLABELLED BACKGROUND Lu-[DOTA0, Tyr3]-octreotate (177Lu-octreotate) is used to treat neuroendocrine tumors with high somatostatin-receptor expression. 177Lu-octreotate is mainly excreted via the kidneys, but to some extent, accumulates in the kidney cortex due to, e.g., tubular reabsorption. Renal toxicity is one of the main limiting factors in 177Lu-octreotate treatment. Further knowledge of the biodistribution and dosimetry of 177Lu-octreotate in individual patients is needed. The aim of this study was to estimate the absorbed dose to the kidneys and compare the results obtained with planar imaging and different dosimetric methods: (1) conjugate-view (CV) method using patient-specific kidney sizes, (2) PA method, based on posterior images only, (3) CV method with reduced number of time points (CVreduced data), and (4) CV method using standard kidney sizes (CVstandard size). METHODS Totally, 33 patients each received 3.4 to 8.2 GBq of 177Lu-octreotate up to five times, with infusion of lysine and arginine to block the renal uptake. Whole-body planar gamma camera images were acquired on days 0, 1, 2, and 7. The 177Lu concentration in the kidneys was determined by the CV method, and the absorbed dose was estimated with patient-specific organ sizes. Comparison to the CV method was made using posterior images only, together with the influence of the number of time points and with standard organ sizes. RESULTS Large interindividual variations were found in the time-activity curve pattern and in the absorbed dose to the kidneys using the CV method: 0.33 to 2.4 Gy/GBq (mean = 0.80 Gy/GBq, SD = 0.30). In the individual patient, the mean deviation of all subsequent kidney doses compared to that of the first administration was 1% (SD = 19%) and 5% (SD = 23%) for the right and left kidneys, respectively. Excluding data for day 7 resulted in large variations in the absorbed dose. CONCLUSION Large interindividual variations in kidney dose were found, demonstrating the need for patient-specific dosimetry and treatment planning.","Larsson, Maria; Bernhardt, Peter; Svensson, Johanna B; Wängberg, Bo; Ahlman, Håkan; Forssell-Aronsson, Eva",EJNMMI research,https://doi.org/10.1186/2191-219x-2-49; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23006939/,515

However, collecting empirical data on violence is challenging due to ethical, safety, and data quality concerns. OBJECTIVE This study estimated the anticipated effect of COVID-19 on violent discipline at home using multivariable predictive regression models. PARTICIPANTS Children aged 1-14 years and household members from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) conducted in Nigeria, Mongolia, and Suriname before the COVID-19 pandemic were included. METHODS A conceptual model of how the COVID-19 pandemic could affect risk factors for violent discipline was developed. Country specific multivariable linear models were used to estimate the association between selected variables from MICS and a violent discipline score which captured the average combination of violent disciplinary methods used in the home. A review of the literature informed the development of quantitative assumptions about how COVID-19 would impact the selected variables under a ""high restrictions"" pandemic scenario, approximating conditions expected during a period of intense response measures, and a ""lower restrictions"" scenario with easing of COVID-19 restrictions but with sustained economic impacts. These assumptions were used to estimate changes in violent discipline scores. RESULTS Under a ""high restrictions"" scenario there would be a 35%-46% increase in violent discipline scores in Nigeria, Mongolia and Suriname, and under a ""lower restrictions"" scenario there would be between a 4%-6% increase in violent discipline scores in these countries.

METHODS This multicenter, observational study was conducted at 158 centers in Japan. Patients with unresectable advanced or recurrent G/GEJ cancer were registered between Nov 1, 2017, and Oct 31, 2018, and observed for 6 months after treatment initiation with nivolumab. Correlation of background characteristics with treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and tumor response was explored. RESULTS Overall, 654 patients were registered (safety analysis set, n = 650; effectiveness analysis set, n = 636; response evaluation set, n = 516). The incidences of all TRAEs and grade ≥ 3 TRAEs were 31.5 and 11.2%, respectively. TRAEs significantly correlated with the absence of peritoneal metastasis; C-reactive protein level < 1; prior G/GEJ cancer surgery; and past or concomitant pulmonary, thyroid, or renal disease (each p < 0.05). The incidence of TRAEs was significantly lower in patients with higher Glasgow prognostic scores (p < 0.05). No new safety signals were observed. Complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease were observed in 1.2, 10.1, 27.1, and 58.3% of the response evaluation set, respectively. Patients aged ≥ 65 years (13.9 vs 5.3%, p = 0.0083) and ≥ 75 years (18.8 vs 9.2%, p = 0.0036) showed a higher response rate than their younger counterparts.

The CYNEFIN framework from Snowden outlines a consistent cognitive approach that offers the leader and leadership team an ability to urgently apply the correct actions to a given situation. This paper proposes a variant CYNEFIN approach for healthcare. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH Consistent and accurate decision-making within health care is the hallmark of an effective and pragmatic leader and leadership team. An awareness of how one's cognitive biases and heuristics may adversely impact on this cognitive process is paramount, as is an understanding of the calibration between fast and slow thinking. FINDINGS The authors propose a variant CYNEFIN approach for health care of ""act-probe-sense-respond"" to resolve complex and time-critical emergency scenarios, using the differing contexts of a cardiac arrest and an evolving crisis management problem as examples. The variant serves as a pragmatic sense-making framework for the health-care leader and leadership team that can be adopted for many time-critical crisis situations.

These are well-reported complications of COVID-19 infection. Earlier publications have shown that CAC and thromboembolism are predictors of mortality among COVID-19 patients with severe disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective study was conducted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) where all confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled and followed until death or ICU discharge. CAC, VTE, along with all comorbidities were recorded. Predictors of mortality were determined by univariate and multivariate regression. RESULTS Among 261 patients with COVID-19, 48.3% survived and 51.7% died. CAC was present in 53.2% and 76.3% of the survivors and non-survivors, respectively (p<0.001); 89 patients (31.4%) had VTE (p=0.36) and 11 patients (4.2%) had arterial thrombosis (p=0.76) among survivors and non-survivors. Age between 71-80 years (p=0.009), male gender (p=0.045), CAC (p<0.001), comorbidities like chronic kidney disease (CKD, p=0.013), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, p=0.001) and asthma (p=0.046), were significant predictors of mortality. CONCLUSION A severe complication of COVID-19 is CAC, such as sepsis-induced coagulopathy, overt disseminated-coagulopathy and VTE. Old age, various comorbidities (e.g. COPD, CKD or asthma), CAC, VTE (pulmonary embolism) and coagulation parameters with critical severity score (D-dimers, platelets, prothrombin time) and the SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score were significant predictors of mortality among COVID-19 patients.","Naqvi, Iftikhar Haider; Alam, Muhammad Tanveer; Rehan, Muhammad; Mahmood, Khalid; Aurangzeb, M; Talib, Abu",Current vascular pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.2174/1570161119666211014162409; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34649490/,515
147752,A survey of international clinical teleneuropsychology service provision prior to and in the context of COVID-19.,2020-08-26,"The present study was undertaken to develop rice-based composite pasta with improved cooking/rehydrating and nutritional qualities. Pasta samples (T1-T10) having different proportions of rice flour (RF, 60-80%), wheat flour (WF, 40-12%), malted green gram flour (MGGF, 5 and 10%) and guar gum (GG, 1-3%) were prepared using a single screw extruder. Pasta made of 100% WF served as the control (T0). The cooked or rehydrated samples were evaluated for their cooking properties (optimum cooking time, cooking loss and swelling index), whiteness and yellowness indices, textural and organoleptic parameters. Substitution of WF by RF significantly reduced the cooking time, and improved the whiteness and swelling indices of the samples. However, reduction in WF increased the cooking loss, compromised textural and organoleptic attributes in samples with high RF content (80%); nevertheless, addition of GG and MGGF reduced these losses and improved the sensory qualities (p < 0.05). Irrespective of the composition of rice-based pasta, the optimal cooking time ranged within 2-4 min (unlike T0) and these samples could also be rehydrated in hot water within a short span of 5 min to attain textural qualities at par with their cooked counterparts and with sensorial scores well above the limit of acceptable range (≥5) (except T3 (80%RF + 20%WF)); nonetheless the cooked ones led to higher preference from the sensory panel. Adhesiveness of the rehydrated samples was lesser than their cooked counterparts, while vice versa was observed in case of their instrumental firmness/hardness. Among these, T7 (70%RF + 19%WF + 10%MGGF + 1%GG) and T9 (80%RF + 13%WF + 5%MGGF + 2%GG) exhibited high protein content (∼1.17-1.29 times higher than T0) and the most desired low in vitro starch digestibility and calorific values (∼1.16-1.25 fold reduction). Thus low-cost quick-cooking/rehydrating pasta can be successfully developed by adding suitable amount of MGGF and GG into rice-wheat composite flours.","Devi, Porinita; Kalita, Sweety; Barooah, Mridula Saikia; Saikia, Ananta; Borah, Abhijit; Ahmed, Tobiul Hussain; Purkayastha, Manashi Das",Food science and technology international = Ciencia y tecnologia de los alimentos internacional,https://doi.org/10.1177/1082013220973807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33291979/,515
148110,Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation improve clinical symptoms in patients with Covid-19: A randomized clinical trial.,2021-09-13,"BACKGROUND Easily accessible, inexpensive, and widely used laboratory tests that demonstrate the severity of COVID-19 are important. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between mortality in COVID-19 and platelet count, Mean Platelet Volume (MPV), and platelet distribution width. METHODS In total, 215 COVID-19 patients were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups. Patients with room air oxygen saturation < 90% were considered as severe COVID-19, and patients with ≥90% were considered moderate COVID-19. Patient medical records and the electronic patient data monitoring system were examined retrospectively. Analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical software. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS The patients' mean age was 64,32 ± 16,07 years. According to oxygen saturation, 81 patients had moderate and 134 had severe COVID-19. Our findings revealed that oxygen saturation at admission and the MPV difference between the first and third days of hospitalization were significant parameters in COVID-19 patients for predicting mortality. While mortality was 8.4 times higher in patients who had oxygen saturation under 90 % at hospital admission, 1 unit increase in MPV increased mortality 1.76 times. CONCLUSION In addition to the lung capacity of patients, the mean platelet volume may be used as an auxiliary test in predicting the mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Güçlü, Ertuğrul; Kocayiğit, Havva; Okan, Hüseyin Doğuş; Erkorkmaz, Unal; Yürümez, Yusuf; Yaylacı, Selcuk; Koroglu, Mehmet; Uzun, Cem; Karabay, Oğuz",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.66.8.1122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32935808/,515

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical criteria in the selection of patients with acute ischemic stroke for thrombectomy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this observational, single-center, prospective cohort study, we studied 72 patients with middle cerebral artery or terminal internal carotid artery occlusion using computed tomographic angiography, followed by core infarct volume determination by diffusion weighted MRI, who underwent thrombectomy after meeting institutional criteria from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2014. In this period, 31 patients with similar ischemic strokes underwent endovascular treatment without MRI and are categorized as computed tomography only and considered in a secondary analysis. INTERVENTIONS Patients were prospectively classified as likely to benefit (LTB) or uncertain to benefit (UTB) using diffusion-weighted imaging lesion volume and clinical criteria (age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, time from onset, baseline modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score, life expectancy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The 90-day mRS score, with favorable defined as a 90-day mRS score of 2 or less. RESULTS Forty patients were prospectively classified as LTB and 32 as UTB. Reperfusion (71 of 103 patients) and prospective categorization as LTB (40 of 103 patients) were associated with favorable outcomes (P < .001 and P < .005, respectively). Successful reperfusion positively affected the distribution of mRS scores of the LTB cohort (P < .001). Reperfusion was achieved in 27 LTB patients (67.5%) and 24 UTB patients (75.0%) (P = .86). Favorable outcomes were obtained in 21 (52.5%) and 8 (25.0%) of LTB and UTB patients who were treated, respectively (P = .02). Favorable outcomes were observed in 20 of the 27 LTB patients (74.1%) who had successful reperfusion compared with 8 of the 24 UTB patients (33.3%) who had successful reperfusion (P = .004). The ratio of treated to screened patients was 1:3. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Prospective classification as LTB by MRI and clinical criteria is associated with likelihood of favorable outcome after thrombectomy, particularly if reperfusion is successful. Selection of patients using MRI compares favorably with selection using computed tomographic techniques with the distinction that a higher proportion of screened patients were treated.","Leslie-Mazwi, Thabele M; Hirsch, Joshua A; Falcone, Guido J; Schaefer, Pamela W; Lev, Michael H; Rabinov, James D; Rost, Natalia S; Schwamm, Lee; González, R Gilberto",JAMA neurology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2015.3000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26524074/,515
150982,Umbilical Cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells for COVID-19 Patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).,2020,"BACKGROUND Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects reproductive-aged women and is associated with increased prevalence of serious clinical problems including: reproductive implications, metabolic dysfunction, and cardiovascular risk. Physical activity offers several health benefits for women with PCOS. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize evidence on the effect of different types of exercise on reproductive function and body composition for women with PCOS. METHODS This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) following recommended review methods. We searched 6 databases: Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature; Embase; MEDLINE (via Ovid); PubMed; Sport Discus; and Web of Science; and we developed search strategies using a combination of Medical Subject Headings terms and text words related to exercise interventions for women with PCOS. There was no restriction on language or publication year. The search was conducted on April 16, 2019 and updated on November 15, 2019. Two authors independently screened citations, determined risk of bias and quality of evidence with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. We conducted meta-analyses following recommended guidelines, and report results using standardized mean difference (SMD). RESULTS Ten RCTs (n = 533) were included in this review. Studies tested the following interventions: aerobic, resistance, and combined (aerobic/resistance) training programs. Most studies were small (average 32, range 15-124 participants), and of relatively short duration (8-32 weeks). There was high heterogeneity for outcomes of reproductive function (menstrual cycle, ovulation, and fertility). We noted low certainty evidence for little to no effect of exercise on reproductive hormones and moderate certainty evidence that aerobic exercise reduced body mass index (BMI) in women with PCOS: BMI SMD -0.35, 95% confidence interval -0.56 to -0.14, P = .001. CONCLUSION For women with PCOS, evidence is limited to discern the effect of exercise on major health outcomes (e.g., reproductive function). There is moderate certainty evidence that aerobic exercise alone is beneficial for reducing BMI in women with PCOS. Future studies should be conducted with longer duration, larger sample sizes, and should provide detailed information on menstrual cycle and fertility outcomes.PROSPERO Systematic review registration: 2017 CRD42017058869.","Dos Santos, Isis Kelly; Ashe, Maureen C; Cobucci, Ricardo Ney; Soares, Gustavo Mafaldo; de Oliveira Maranhão, Tecia Maria; Dantas, Paulo Moreira Silva",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000019644; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32311937/,515
151285,Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Cold Agglutinin Syndrome: An Interesting Case.,2021,"Seasonal influenza virus is associated with high morbidity and mortality especially in vulnerable patient populations. Here we demonstrate the novel use of Sofia Influenza A + B FIA, a rapid antigen-based influenza point-of-care test (POCT), combined with Virena software for automatic de-identified tracking of influenza activity across the Los Angeles area and for predicting surges of influenza cases in the emergency department (ED). We divided outpatient clinics into 6 geographic zones and compared weekly influenza activity. In the outpatient setting, there were 1,666 and 274 influenza A and influenza B positives, respectively, across the 2018-2019 influenza season and 1,857 and 1,449 influenza A and influenza B positives, respectively, during the 2019-2020 influenza season, with zone-specific differences observed. Moreover, we found that a rapid increase in outpatient influenza was followed by an influx in influenza positive cases in the ED, offering a 1-3 week warning sign for ED influx of triple or quadruple the number of influenza cases compared to the prior week. Sofia Influenza A + B FIA allows for surveillance of real-time deidentified influenza activity. Tracking of such data may serve as a valuable region-specific influenza indicator and predictor to guide infection prevention measures in both the outpatient and hospital settings. High impact interventions include designating areas of waiting rooms for influenza-like illnesses, altering staff scheduling in anticipation of surges, and securing sufficient personal protective equipment and antivirals during the height of influenza season.","Larkin, Paige M K; Manuel, Vladimir; Hernandez, Naureen; Garner, Omai B",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01560-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32967898/,515

Effective translation from preclinical studies to clinical trials has yet to be accomplished, perhaps because of the use of multiple applications of RIC (e.g., pre-, per-, or post-conditioning) in preclinical studies by both invasive and non-invasive protocols, some of which not clinically applicable. Our systematic review conformed to PRISMA guidelines and addressed differences in clinically relevant RIC applications and outcomes between preclinical and clinical studies. We retrieved a total of 30 studies (8 human; 22 animal) that met the inclusion criteria of testing clinically relevant procedures; namely, non-invasive and per- or post-conditioning protocols. Per-conditioning was applied in 6 animal and 3 human studies, post-conditioning was applied in 16 animal and 5 human studies, and both conditioning methods were applied in 2 animal studies. Application of RIC varied between human and animal studies regarding initiation, duration, repetition, and number of limbs included. Study designs did not systematically apply blinding, randomization, or placebo controls. On only a few occasions did preclinical studies include animals with clinically relevant comorbidities. Clinical trials were challenged by not completing the intended number of RIC cycles or addressing this deficit in the data analysis. Consistency and transferability of methods used for positive animal studies and subsequent human studies are essential for the optimal translation of results. Consensus on preclinical and clinical RIC procedures should be reached for a full understanding of the possible beneficial effects of RIC treatment in stroke.","Hansen, Line Fuglsang; Nielsen, Nicholine S K; Christoffersen, Laura Cathrine; Kruuse, Christina",Annals of clinical and translational neurology,https://doi.org/10.1002/acn3.51405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34133841/,515

Healthcare workers, on the front lines of the epidemic, are facing major and potentially traumatic stressful events, overwhelming their ability to cope and their resources. OBJECTIVE The objective of this article will be to show how the use of the URG-EMDR protocol in a telemental health setting has proven to be feasible and effective in the treatment of a group of healthcare professionals working in nursing homes or hospital services that were highly mobilized during the acute phase of COVID-19. METHOD 17 participants, registered nurses (N = 7) and licensed practical nurses (N = 10), were remotely treated using the URG-EMDR protocol in a single session. The assessment focused on anxiety and depressive symptoms (HAD scale) and the level of perceived disturbance (SUD). An additional evaluation of the satisfaction with the remote psychotherapy intervention was conducted. RESULTS As the URG-EMDR protocol has already proven itself during emergency interventions, it is interesting to note that its remote use in the treatment of healthcare providers caring for COVID-19 patients allows for an improvement in the emotional state and a decrease in perceived disturbance, in a single session. This result is maintained 1 week after the intervention, despite the continued professional activities of the participants and the continuity of the event. Moreover, the remote therapy setting was judged satisfactory by the patients, even if it required adjustments and certain recommendations for practice. DISCUSSION The remote use of the URG-EMDR protocol opens up innovative perspectives for early interventions and the prevention of the development of psychological disorders in the long term following a situation of acute stress.","Tarquinio, Cyril; Brennstuhl, Marie-Jo; Rydberg, Jenny Ann; Bassan, Fanny; Peter, Lydia; Tarquinio, Camille Louise; Auxéméry, Yann; Rotonda, Christine; Tarquinio, Pascale",Issues in mental health nursing,https://doi.org/10.1080/01612840.2020.1818014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052727/,515

To prevent its spread, lockdowns were announced and working women had to perform dual roles: work from home and work for home. In the present study researchers aimed to assess mental and physical load on Indian women professionals during lockdown due to COVID-19. An online cross-sectional survey was carried out using a Google form. The questionnaire consisted of queries based on following domains: demographic details, awareness of COVID-19 pandemic, analysis of mental health of participants during lockdown, estimate of physical load for work from home, physical load due to house hold chores and overall effect on health. The sample was collected from 28th April to 12th May 2020 and 537 responses were recorded from women working from home as well as working for home through snowball sampling technique. Mental health was moderately and severely affected in 27.5% and 27% of participants respectively. 34.3% experienced great increase in physical load due to house hold chores during lockdown. 45.81% reported pain in neck and back region with 36.31% participants reported strain in their eyes sometimes. 15.08% and 8.37% had a tendency to over react in the present situation often and always respectively.

MLL fusion patterns are associated with the patient's prognosis; however, their relationship with driver mutations is unclear. We conducted sequence analyses of 338 genes in pediatric patients with MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) AML (n = 56; JPLSG AML-05 study) alongside data from the TARGET study's pediatric cohorts with MLL-r AML (n = 104), non-MLL-r AML (n = 581), and adult MLL-r AML (n = 81). KRAS mutations were most frequent in pediatric patients with high-risk MLL fusions (MLL-MLLLT10, MLL-MLLT4, and MLL-MLLT1). Pediatric patients with MLL-r AML (n = 160) and a KRAS mutation (KRAS-MT) had a significantly worse prognosis than those without a KRAS mutation (KRAS-WT) (5-year event-free survival [EFS]: 51.8% vs 18.3%, P < .0001; 5-year overall survival [OS]: 67.3% vs 44.3%, P = .003). The adverse prognostic impact of KRAS mutations was confirmed in adult MLL-r AML. KRAS mutations were associated with adverse prognoses in pediatric patients with both high-risk (MLLT10+MLLT4+MLLT1; n = 60) and intermediate-to-low-risk (MLLT3+ELL+others; n = 100) MLL fusions. The prognosis did not differ significantly between patients with non-MLL-r AML with KRAS-WT or KRAS-MT. Multivariate analysis showed the presence of a KRAS mutation to be an independent prognostic factor for EFS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-3.59; P = .002) and OS (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.01-3.31; P = .045) in MLL-r AML. The mutation is a distinct adverse prognostic factor in MLL-r AML, regardless of risk subgroup, and is potentially useful for accurate treatment stratification.

The education sector has benefited from this ICT-driven revolution, which has provided and expanded multiple new tools and teaching methods that did not exist just a few decades ago. In light of this technological change, virtual laboratories (VLs) based on the use of virtual reality (VR) have emerged, which are increasingly used to facilitate the teaching-learning process in a wide range of training activities, both academic and professional types. The set of advantages offered by this type of VL, the main of which are listed in this article, has made its use increasingly common as support for engineering classes at universities. This paper presents a study involving 420 engineering students from Spanish and Portuguese universities and associated analyses on the assessment of different parameters in various VLs designed by the authors. The results obtained indicate that, in general, VR-based VLs are widely accepted and demanded by students, who likewise consider real laboratories (RLs) necessary in face-to-face teaching. In the current post-COVID-19 educational scenario, VLs and RLs will coexist within the new hybrid models that combine face-to-face and online teaching and learning.","Vergara, Diego Fernández-Arias Pablo Extremera Jamil Dávila Lilian P.; Rubio, Manuel P.",Materials Today: Proceedings,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2021.07.494,515

Investment in education and lifelong learning is an essential prerequisite for economic development and for promoting national competitiveness, as well as for achieving higher levels of prosperity. One of the main objectives of the survey was to clarify the relationship between the assessment of the students' annual score by graduating the school and the results of the state exam, as well as the relationship with the result of the first semester of study and the assessment of the semester, both in Latvia as a whole and depending on the students' place of residence. Continuing previous studies, RTU and LLU researchers have conducted extensive surveys of students between 2019 and 2020 to assess the dynamics of the development of teaching performance in math in the changing circumstances of Covid19 in the pandemic. The article reflects the results of a study on the dynamics of the level of knowledge of engineering students in math, as well as the development of the level of knowledge in this field during studies.

The disease severity is mediated by cell death and inflammation, which regulate both the antiviral and the pathological innate immune responses. ZBP1, an interferon-induced cytosolic nucleic acid sensor, facilitates antiviral responses via RIPK3. Although ZBP1-mediated cell death is widely described, whether and how it promotes inflammatory signaling is unclear. Here, we report a ZBP1-induced inflammatory signaling pathway that depends on ubiquitination and RIPK3’s scaffolding ability independently of cell death. In human cells, ZBP1 associates with RIPK1 and RIPK3 as well as ubiquitin ligases cIAP1 and LUBAC. RIPK1 and ZBP1 are ubiquitinated to promote TAK1- and IKK-mediated inflammatory signaling. Additionally, RIPK1 recruits the p43/41-caspase-8-p43-FLIP heterodimer to suppress RIPK3 kinase activity, which otherwise promotes inflammatory signaling in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Lastly, we show that ZBP1 contributes to SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine production. Taken together, we describe a ZBP1-RIPK1-RIPK3-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway relayed by the scaffolding role of RIPKs and regulated by caspase-8. Our results suggest the ZBP1 pathway contributes to inflammation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Peng, Ruoshi; Wang-Kan, Xuan; Idorn, Manja; Zhou, Felix Y; Orozco, Susana L; McCarthy, Julia; Leung, Carol S; Lu, Xin; Bagola, Katrin; Rehwinkel, Jan; Oberst, Andrew; Maelfait, Jonathan; Paludan, Søren R; Gyrd-Hansen, Mads",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.01.462460,515
169669,Coronavirus disease 2019 in Egypt: country experience and preparedness,2021,"An Informatics Consult has been proposed in which clinicians request novel evidence from large scale health data resources, tailored to the treatment of a specific patient, with return of results in clinical timescales. However, the availability of such consultations is lacking. We seek to provide an Informatics Consult for a situation where a treatment indication and contraindication coexist in the same patient, i.e., anti-coagulation use for stroke prevention in a patient with both atrial fibrillation (AF) and liver cirrhosis. We examined four sources of evidence for the effect of warfarin on stroke risk (efficacy) or all-cause mortality (safety) from: (i) randomised controlled trials (RCTs), (ii) meta-analysis of prior observational studies, (iii) trial emulation (using population electronic health records (N = 3,854,710) and (iv) genetic evidence (Mendelian randomisation). We developed prototype forms to request an Informatics Consult and return of results in electronic health record systems. We found 0 RCT reports and 0 trials recruiting for patients with AF and cirrhosis. We found broad concordance across the three new sources of evidence we generated. Meta-analysis of prior observational studies showed that warfarin use was associated with lower stroke risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.71). In a target trial emulation, warfarin was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR = 0.61) and ischaemic stroke (HR = 0.27). Mendelian randomisation served as a drug target validation where we found that lower levels of vitamin K1 (warfarin is a vitamin K1 antagonist) are associated with lower stroke risk. A pilot survey with an independent sample of 34 clinicians revealed that 85% of clinicians found information on prognosis useful and that 79% thought that they should have access to the Informatics Consult as a service within their healthcare systems. We identified candidate steps for automation to scale evidence generation and to accelerate the return of results within clinical timescales.","Lai, A. G.; Chang, W. H.; Parisinos, C.

A study conducted at our institution identified that patients were not provided with sufficient information regarding HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPV-OPSCC). It was also recognized that patients and their partner felt guilt and stigma about the HPV diagnosis, which had a negative impact on their intimacy. The aim of this project was to create an educational tool to address the concerns of patients and their families with HPV-OPSCC through collaboration of an interprofessional health care team and patient representatives. Methods: As part of the needs assessment, an environmental scan of patient education tools and a literature review on current evidence and management of HPV-OPSCC was conducted, resulting in pamphlets, articles and websites from various cancer centres in North America. Our institutional study was used to identify the patients’ needs including: more information on the cause of HPV, consequences to their health, and future implications to the health of their partner(s). Three virtual meetings with the development team were conducted to identify the key messages and resources suggested to be included in the educational tool. The principles of lay language and clear design was adhered to in order to ensure the educational tool was acceptable and understandable for patients and their families. Feedback was elicited from stakeholders of the Head and Neck Site Group and the Patient and Family Education Committee. Results: Discussing an HPV diagnosis on top of cancer treatment options can be overwhelming for the patient on their first visit. Furthermore, family members may not be able to accompany the patient to their appointment due to current restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby removing an aspect of support and opportunity for family members to ask questions. This educational tool provides patients and their loved ones answers to common questions regarding HPV-OPSCC, explains how this diagnosis affects their treatment outcomes, and helps patients and family navigate the available resources and supportive services within the cancer centre and on the internet. Challenges identified throughout the project include recruiting patient representatives who felt comfortable sharing their experience, as well as obtaining feedback from a large and diverse team of busy health care professionals. Conclusions: This tool will be in the form of a printed document and will be found on the cancer centre website. Not only was the development of this tool driven by patient need, but patient engagement was prioritized with two patient representatives on the development team to collaborate on the content and design of the education tool. An evaluation of the educational tool will be conducted and may consist of tracking the number of times the educational tool was accessed and administering a survey during the patient's next appointment to determine satisfaction.","Galapin, M.; Gray, S.; Korman, M.

The small size of nanobodies bestows multiple therapeutic advantages (stability, tumor penetration) with the first therapeutic approval in 2018 cementing the clinical viability of this format. Structured data and sequence information of nanobodies will enable the accelerated clinical development of nanobody-based therapeutics. Though the nanobody sequence and structure data are deposited in the public domain at an accelerating pace, the heterogeneity of sources and lack of standardization hampers reliable harvesting of nanobody information. We address this issue by creating the Integrated Database of Nanobodies for Immunoinformatics (INDI, http://research.naturalantibody.com/nanobodies). INDI collates nanobodies from all the major public outlets of biological sequences: patents, GenBank, next-generation sequencing repositories, structures and scientific publications. We equip INDI with powerful nanobody-specific sequence and text search facilitating access to more than 11 million nanobody sequences. INDI should facilitate development of novel nanobody-specific computational protocols helping to deliver on the therapeutic promise of this drug format.","Deszynski, P.; Mlokosiewicz, J.; Volanakis, A.; Jaszczyszyn, I.; Castellana, N.; Bonissone, S.; Ganesan, R.; Krawczyk, K.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.04.21261581v1?rss=1,515

The sudden shift to online learning requires an investigation into students' readiness and willingness for such a mode of learning. This can provide educators with many prospects about learning outcomes achievement and assessment, test performance, and interaction during classes. Therefore, the current study seeks to contribute to the well-known area of learner autonomy research, which is still lacking in the context of the study, by exploring the readiness of Saudi first -year undergraduate English learners towards online education. Participants' level of readiness is identified according to their autonomous behaviors and activities. The study will also assess the investigated concept considering the influence of gender and field of study of the participants on their autonomy levels. A total of 802 students participated in this study. It was found that Saudi first -year university students are moderately autonomous, that both males and females have similar levels of aptitude and readiness for taking responsibility for their learning, and that English -major and non -English -major groups showed comparatively similar levels across different learning autonomy dimensions. Yet interestingly, English -major participants displayed a relatively lower autonomy level than students of other majors.","Ghobain, E. A.; Zughaibi, A.

It is fortunate that the culprit virus can be grown without much difficulty from a commonly used cell line, allowing an unlimited supply of isolates for further molecular studies and leading to the development of sensitive diagnostic assays. How the virus has successfully jumped the species barrier is still a mystery. The superspreading events that occurred within hospital, hotel and high-density housing estate opens a new chapter in the mechanisms and routes of virus transmission. The old practice of quarantine proved to be still useful in controlling the global outbreak. Despite all the available sophisticated tests, alertness with early recognition by healthcare workers and prompt isolation of suspected cases is still the most important step for containing the spread of the infection. Although the rapidly evolving outbreak did not allow the conducting of systematic clinical trails to evaluate treatment options, the accumulated experience on managing SARS patients will improve the clinical outcome should SARS return. Although SARS led to more than 700 deaths worldwide, the lessons learnt have prepared healthcare systems worldwide to face future emerging and re-emerging infections.","Chan, Paul K S; Tang, Julian W; Hui, David S C",Clinical science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16411895/,515

Although there were no significant differences in mammary gland fat pad and parenchyma areas between the intact experimental groups, the numbers of duct branchings and buds were significantly larger in the C+W treated mice than in the control mice. The ratio of BrdU immunopositive cells to total epithelial cells was higher in C+W treated intact mice. Ultrastructurally, epithelial cells of the mammary buds and ducts possessed an oval and lucent nucleus, and ribosomes increased in number or developed to a greater degree in C+W treated intact mice than in the control mice. Conversely, there were no significant differences in any measurements of mammary gland between the experimental groups of ovariectomized mice. BrdU immunoreactive cells were never seen and the ultrastructure of mammary epihelial cells indicated the inactive cell phase in both ovariectomied mice. In comparison between the intact and overiectomized mice, the mammary fat pad area was larger in the ovariectomized mice than in the intact mice, although another four measurements were larger in the intact groups. These observations suggest that administration with C+W could promote the development of mammary glands via ovary in immature mice.","Bayin, Jiragara; Matsumoto, Mitsuharu; Islam, Mohammad Saiful; Yabuki, Akira; Kanouchi, Hiroaki; Oka, Tatsuzo; Nishinakagawa, Hayao",The Journal of veterinary medical science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19887738/,515

CASE REPORT A 15-year-old girl with acute myelogenous leukemia, suffering from severe septic and cardiogenic shock, was treated by venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (va-ECMO). Sufficient extracorporeal blood flow matching the required oxygen demand could only be achieved by peripheral cannulation of both femoral arteries. Venous drainage was performed with a bicaval cannula inserted via the left V. femoralis. To accomplish left ventricular unloading, an additional drainage cannula was placed in the left atrium via percutaneous atrioseptostomy (va-va-ECMO). Cardiac function recovered and the girl was weaned from the ECMO on day 6. Successful allogenic stem cell transplantation took place 2 months later.

This study aimed to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on routine vaccinations by country, antigen, and sector (public or private), up to 1 June 2020, and to identify the reasons for disruption and possible solutions. Methods: Sanofi Pasteur teams from 19 countries in SEAR/WPR completed a structured questionnaire reporting on COVID-19 disruptions for 13-19 routinely delivered antigens per country, based on sales data, government reports, and regular physician interactions. Data were analysed descriptively, disruption causes ranked, and solutions evaluated using a modified public health best practices framework. Findings: 95% (18/19) of countries reported vaccination disruption. When stratified by country, a median of 91% (interquartile range 77-94) of antigens were impacted. Infancy and school-entry age vaccinations were most impacted. Both public and private sector healthcare providers experienced disruptions. Vaccination rates had not recovered for 39% of impacted antigens by 1 June 2020. Fear of infection, movement/travel restrictions, and limited healthcare access were the highest-ranked reasons for disruption. Highest-scoring solutions were separating vaccination groups from unwell patients, non-traditional vaccination venues, virtual engagement, and social media campaigns. Many of these solutions were under-utilised. Interpretation: COVID-19-induced disruption of routine vaccination was more widespread than previously reported. Adaptable solutions were identified which could be implemented in SEAR/WPR and elsewhere.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated consecutive autopsy cases, deceased for COVID-19, from Italy between Apr 30, 2020 and Jan 18, 2021. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 in cardiomyocytes, expression of ACE2 (total and glycosylated form), and transmembrane protease serine protease-2 (TMPRSS2) protein. In order to study the role of diabetes on cardiomyocyte alterations, independently of COVID-19, we investigated ACE2, glycosylated ACE2, and TMPRSS2 proteins in cardiomyocytes from DM and Non-DM explanted-hearts. Finally, to investigate the effects of DM on ACE2 protein modification, an in vitro glycation study of recombinant human ACE2 (hACE2) was performed to evaluate the effects on binding to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The authors included cardiac tissue from 97 autopsies. DM was diagnosed in 37 patients (38%). Fourth-seven out of 97 autopsies (48%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cardiomyocytes. Thirty out of 37 DM autopsy cases (81%) and 17 out of 60 Non-DM autopsy cases (28%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA in cardiomyocytes. Total ACE2, glycosylated ACE2, and TMPRSS2 protein expressions were higher in cardiomyocytes from autopsied and explanted hearts of DM than Non-DM. In vitro exposure of monomeric hACE2 to 120 mM glucose for 12 days led to non-enzymatic glycation of four lysine residues in the neck domain affecting the protein oligomerization. CONCLUSIONS: The upregulation of ACE2 expression (total and glycosylated forms) in DM cardiomyocytes, along with non-enzymatic glycation, could increase the susceptibility to COVID-19 infection in DM patients by favouring the cellular entry of SARS-CoV2.","D039,; Onofrio, Nunzia; Scisciola, Lucia; Sardu, Celestino; Trotta, Maria Consiglia; De Feo, Marisa; Maiello, Ciro; Mascolo, Pasquale; De Micco, Francesco; Turriziani, Fabrizio; Municinò, Emilia; Monetti, Pasquale; Lombardi, Antonio; Napolitano, Maria Gaetana; Marino, Federica Zito; Ronchi, Andrea; Grimaldi, Vincenzo; Hermenean, Anca; Rizzo, Maria Rosaria; Barbieri, Michelangela; Franco, Renato; Campobasso, Carlo Pietro; Napoli, Claudio; Municinò, Maurizio; Paolisso, Giuseppe; Balestrieri, Maria Luisa; Marfella, Raffaele",Cardiovasc Diabetol,,515
216097,Severe coronavirus disease pneumonia in a pregnant woman at 25 weeks' gestation: A case report,2021,"BACKGROUND In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, health care decision-makers in North Carolina needed information about the available health workforce in order to conduct workforce surge planning and to anticipate concerns about professional or geographic workforce shortages.METHOD Descriptive and cartographic analyses were conducted using licensure data held by the North Carolina Health Professions Data System to assess the supply of respiratory therapists, nurses, and critical care physicians in North Carolina. Licensure data were merged with population data and numbers of intensive care unit (ICU) beds drawn from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS).RESULTS The pandemic highlighted how critical data infrastructure is to public health infrastructure. Respiratory therapists and acute care, emergency, and critical care nurses were diffused broadly throughout the state, with higher concentrations in urban areas. Critical care physicians were primarily based in areas with academic health centers.LIMITATIONS Data were unavailable to capture the rapid changes in supply due to clinicians reentering or exiting the workforce. County-level analyses did not reflect individual, facility-level supply, which was needed to plan organizational responses.CONCLUSIONS Health care decision-makers in North Carolina were able to access information about the supply of clinicians critical to caring for COVID-19 patients due to the state's long-standing investments in health workforce data infrastructure. Ability to respond was made easier due to strong working relationships between the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, the North Carolina Area Health Education Centers Program, the health professional licensure boards, and state government health care agencies.","Wilson, Heather; Galloway, Evan M; Spero, Julie C; Thomas, Shikira; Long, Julianna C; Ricketts, Thomas C; Fraher, Erin P",N C Med J,,515
216174,Rapid Detection of Asymptomatic Coronavirus Disease 2019 by Computed Tomography Image Guidance for Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy,2020,"To date, no effective vaccines or therapies are available against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pandemic agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Due to their safety, efficacy and specificity, peptide inhibitors hold great promise for the treatment of newly emerging viral pathogens. Based on the known structures of viral proteins and their cellular targets, antiviral peptides can be rationally designed and optimized. The resulting peptides may be highly specific for their respective targets and particular viral pathogens or exert broad antiviral activity. Here, we summarize the current status of peptides inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 entry and outline the strategies used to design peptides targeting the ACE2 receptor or the viral spike protein and its activating proteases furin, transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), or cathepsin L. In addition, we present approaches used against related viruses such as SARS-CoV-1 that might be implemented for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Schütz, Desiree; Ruiz-Blanco, Yasser B; Münch, Jan; Kirchhoff, Frank; Sanchez-Garcia, Elsa; Müller, Janis A",Adv Drug Deliv Rev,,515
216221,Asymptomatic subclinical cases of coronavirus disease 2019 without viral transmission in three independent families,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has tremendously impacted the world. The number of confirmed cases has continued to increase, causing damage to society and the economy worldwide. The public pays close attention to information on the pandemic and learns about the disease through various media outlets. The dissemination of comprehensive and accurate COVID-19 information that the public needs helps to educate people so they can take preventive measures. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the dissemination of COVID-19 information by analyzing the information released by the official WeChat account of the People's Daily during the pandemic. The most-read COVID-19 information in China was summarized, and the factors that influence information dissemination were studied to understand the characteristics that affect its dissemination. Moreover, this was conducted in order to identify how to effectively disseminate COVID-19 information and to provide suggestions on how to manage public opinion and information governance during a pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective study based on a WeChat official account. We collected all COVID-19-related information, starting with the first report about COVID-19 from the People's Daily and ending with the last piece of information about lifting the first-level emergency response in 34 Chinese provinces. A descriptive analysis was then conducted on this information, as well as on Qingbo Big Data's dissemination index. Multiple linear regression was utilized to study the factors that affected information dissemination based on various characteristics and the dissemination index. RESULTS: From January 19 to May 2, 2020, the People's Daily released 1984 pieces of information; 1621 were related to COVID-19, which mainly included headline news items, items with emotional content, and issues related to the pandemic's development. By analyzing the dissemination index, seven information dissemination peaks were discerned. Among the three dimensions of COVID-19 information-media salience, content, and format-eight factors affected the spread of COVID-19 information. CONCLUSIONS: Different types of pandemic-related information have varying dissemination power. To effectively disseminate information and prevent the spread of COVID-19, we should identify the factors that affect this dissemination. We should then disseminate the types of information the public is most concerned about, use information to educate people to improve their health literacy, and improve public opinion and information governance.","Fan, Zina; Yin, Wenqiang; Zhang, Han; Wang, Dandan; Fan, Chengxin; Chen, Zhongming; Hu, Jinwei; Ma, Dongping; Guo, Hongwei",J Med Internet Res,,515

216991,Early prediction of the risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019: A key step in therapeutic decision making,2020,"Molecular imaging using PET/CT or PET/MRI has evolved from an experimental imaging modality at its inception in 1972 to an integral component of diagnostic procedures in oncology, and, to lesser extent, in cardiology and neurology, by successfully offering in-vivo imaging and quantitation of key pathophysiological targets or molecular signatures, such as glucose metabolism in cancerous disease. Apart from metabolism probes, novel radiolabeled peptide and antibody PET tracers, including radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have entered the clinical arena, providing the in-vivo capability to collect target-specific quantitative in-vivo data on cellular and molecular pathomechanisms on a whole-body scale, and eventually, extract imaging biomarkers possibly serving as prognostic indicators. The success of molecular imaging in mapping disease severity on a whole-body scale, and directing targeted therapies in oncology possibly could translate to the management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), by identifying, localizing, and quantifying involvement of different immune mediated responses to the infection with SARS-COV2 during the course of acute infection and possible, chronic courses with long-term effects on specific organs. The authors summarize current knowledge for medical imaging in COVID-19 in general with a focus on molecular imaging technology and provide a perspective for immunologists interested in molecular imaging research using validated and immediately available molecular probes, as well as possible future targets, highlighting key targets for tailored treatment approaches as brought up by key opinion leaders.","Juengling, Freimut D; Maldonado, Antonio; Wuest, Frank; Schindler, Thomas H",Front Immunol,,515

218545,How do routine laboratory tests change in coronavirus disease 2019?,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively analyze the chest computed tomography (CT) features in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. METHODS: From January 9, 2020, to February 26, 2020, totally 56 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 underwent chest CT. For 40 patients, follow-up CT scans were obtained. The CT images were evaluated for the number, type and distribution of the opacity, and the affected lung lobes. Furthermore, the initial CT scan and the follow-up CT scans were compared. RESULTS: Forty patients (83.6%) had two or more opacities in the lung. Eighteen (32.7%) patients had only ground-glass opacities; twenty-nine patients (52.7%) had ground-glass and consolidative opacities; and eight patients (14.5%) had only consolidation. A total of 43 patients (78.2%) showed two or more lobes involved. The opacities tended to be both in peripheral and central (30/55, 54.5%) or purely peripheral distribution (25/55, 45.5%). Fifty patients (90.9%) had the lower lobe involved. The first follow-up CT scans showed that twelve patients (30%) had improvement, 26 (65%) patients had mild-moderate progression, and two patients (5%) had severe progression with ""white lungs."" The second follow-up CT showed that 22 patients (71%) showed improvement compared with the first follow-up CT, four patients (12.9%) had aggravated progression, and five patients (16.1%) showed unchanged radiographic appearance. CONCLUSIONS: The common CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia are multiple lung opacities, multiple types of the opacity (ground-glass, ground-glass and consolidation, and consolidation alone), and multiple lobes especially the lower lobe involved. Follow-up CT could demonstrate the rapid progression of COVID-19 pneumonia (either in aggravation or absorption). KEY POINTS: â¢ The predominant CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia are multiple ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation and, with both lungs, multiple lobes and especially the lower lobe affected. â¢ CT plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia progression. â¢ CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia may not be consistent with the clinical symptoms or the initial RT-PCR test results.","Fu, Fangfang; Lou, Jianghua; Xi, Deyan; Bai, Yan; Ma, Gongbao; Zhao, Bin; Liu, Dong; Bao, Guofeng; Lei, Zhidan; Wang, Meiyun",Eur Radiol,,515

For each Sy1 we deduced that black hole (BH) mass, bolometric luminosity, Eddington ratio and power-law index of the continuum, which we compared with the star formation rate (SFR) and host morphology. Having separated our sample in two spectroscopic subgroups, Sy1s with only broad Balmer lines (Sy1B) and with both narrow and broad (Sy1N) lines and distinguishing those that show as outflow (Sy1Bw and Sy1Nw), we report the following differences: 1) the BH mass is systematically higher and the power-law steeper in the Sy1B-Sy1Bw than in the Sy1N-Sy1Nw, 2) V_max is higher in the Sy1Bw than in the Sy1Nw, correlated in both groups with the BH mass and bolometric luminosity, 3) the Eddington ratio and SFR are higher in the Sy1 with outflows, and 4) the specific star formation rates (sSFRs) of the Sy1s are normal for their morphology and mass; typical of early-type spiral galaxies in the green valley, far from the quenched regime. From these results we conclude that in Sy1s AGN winds are triggered by higher accretion rates and probably radiatively launched, and there is no clear evidence of an effect on the star formation.","Torres-Papaqui, Juan Pablo; Coziol, Roger; Romero-Cruz, Fernando J.; Robleto-Or'us, Aitor C.; Escobar-V'asquez, Gabriela; Morales-Vargas, Abd'ias; Trejo-Alonso, J.

221936,Risk Factors for SARS-CoV2 Infection in Pregnant Women,2020,"Various studies across the globe have emphasized the importance of monitoring stress levels among students pursuing professional courses, especially medical and dental students. The pandemic caused by the novel Corona virus affected the lives of people and economies of almost all nations in a manner no one could have ever fathomed. Unexpected and unprecedented changes have occurred in the way we work, study, interact, travel and many aspects of the way we humans lead our lives.The period of lockdown was a difficult period for everyone, more so for the youth, as they were forced to remain indoors, now no longer being able to physically interact with their friends,go to college, visit malls, socialize, pursue pass-times and hobbies or generally have a life that the younger generation is used to.Academic activities initially came to a standstill before shifting to online mode which was new to both, teachers and students. The objective of the current questionnaire-based study was to find out the perceived stress levels during the COVID-19 lockdown among the students and how capable they think they are to cope with these testing times. This survey was undertaken among the students from first to final year of a dental college in Nasik, Maharashtra in the first phase of lockdown in India from 22 Mar 2020 to 14 April 2020. A pretested self-administered questionnaire using Google forms was used for the data collection after getting approval from the Institutional Ethical Committee. Students from all the four years reported being stressed and academic factors were one of the most important stressors. During the lockdown, portion completion, delay in academic activities, uncertainties of the disease and the impending exams were the main causes of anxiety and stress. Continuous student engagement during the period and the availability of a staff to discuss and talk out a problem helped in a big way.It is suggested that mental health of college students should be monitored during such unusual circumstances as the pandemic. The introduction of stress management education into the curriculum could prove useful to the students to help them deal with any such situation in the future. © 2021 Oriental Scientific Publishing Company.

Aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and outcome of IPA in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We prospectively screened 32 critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia for a time period of 28 days using a standardized study protocol for oberservation of developement of COVID-19 associated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). We collected laboratory, microbiological, virological and clinical parameters at defined timepoints in combination with galactomannan-antigen-detection from nondirected bronchial lavage (NBL). We used logistic regression analyses to assess if COVID-19 was independently associated with IPA and compared it with matched controls. FINDINGS: CAPA was diagnosed at a median of 4 days after ICU admission in 11/32 (34%) of critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia as compared to 8% in the control cohort. In the COVID-19 cohort, mean age, APACHE II score and ICU mortality were higher in patients with CAPA than in patients without CAPA (36% versus 9.5%; p<0.001). ICU stay (21 versus 17 days; p = 0.340) and days of mechanical ventilation (20 versus 15 days; p = 0.570) were not different between both groups. In regression analysis COVID-19 and APACHE II score were independently associated with IPA. INTERPRETATION: CAPA is highly prevalent and associated with a high mortality rate. COVID-19 is independently associated with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. A standardized screening and diagnostic approach as presented in our study can help to identify affected patients at an early stage.","Lahmer, Tobias; Kriescher, Silja; Herner, Alexander; Rothe, Kathrin; Spinner, Christoph D; Schneider, Jochen; Mayer, Ulrich; Neuenhahn, Michael; Hoffmann, Dieter; Geisler, Fabian; Heim, Markus; Schneider, Gerhard; Schmid, Roland M; Huber, Wolfgang; Rasch, Sebastian",PLoS One,,515

224973,The Effect of Helicobacter pylori on the Presentation and Clinical Course of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection,2021,"Recent studies have indicated that COVID-19 is an airborne disease, which has driven conservative social distancing and widescale usage of face coverings. Airborne virus transmission occurs through droplets formed during respiratory events (breathing, speaking, coughing, and sneezing) associated with the airflow through a network of nasal and buccal passages. The airflow interacts with saliva/mucus films where droplets are formed and dispersed, creating a route to transmit SARS-CoV-2. Here, we present a series of numerical simulations to investigate droplet dispersion from a sneeze while varying a series of human physiological factors that can be associated with illness, anatomy, stress condition, and sex of an individual. The model measures the transmission risk utilizing an approximated upper respiratory tract geometry for the following variations: (1) the effect of saliva properties and (2) the effect of geometric features within the buccal/nasal passages. These effects relate to natural human physiological responses to illness, stress, and sex of the host as well as features relating to poor dental health. The results find that the resulting exposure levels are highly dependent on the fluid dynamics that can vary depending on several human factors. For example, a sneeze without flow in the nasal passage (consistent with congestion) yields a 300% rise in the droplet content at 1.83 m (&#8776;6 ft) and an increase over 60% on the spray distance 5 s after the sneeze. Alternatively, when the viscosity of the saliva is increased (consistent with the human response to illness), the number of droplets is both fewer and larger, which leads to an estimated 47% reduction in the transmission risk. These findings yield novel insight into variability in the exposure distance and indicate how physiological factors affect transmissibility rates. Such factors may partly relate to how the immune system of a human has evolved to prevent transmission or be an underlying factor driving superspreading events in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fontes, D; Reyes, J; Ahmed, K; Kinzel, M",Phys Fluids (1994),,515

Meanwhile, software companies have successfully launched programs like Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and FindBugs""fixit""to contribute to open-source projects. Inspired by the success of these programs, we propose GitHub-OSS Fixit, a course project where students are taught to contribute to open-source Java projects by fixing bugs reported in GitHub. We described our course outline to teach students SE concepts by encouraging the usages of several automated program analysis tools. We also included the carefully designed instructions that we gave to students for participating in GitHub-OSS Fixit. As all lectures and labs are conducted online, we think that our course design could help in guiding future online SE courses. Overall, our survey results show that students think that GitHub-OSS Fixit could help them to improve many skills and apply the knowledge taught in class.

The benefits of automated contact tracing are two-fold. Contact tracing promises to reduce the number of infections by being able to: 1) systematically identify all of those that have been in contact with someone who has had COVID; and, 2) ensure those that have been exposed to the virus do not unknowingly infect others.""COVI""is the name of a recent contact tracing app developed by Mila and was proposed to help combat COVID-19 in Canada. The app was designed to inform each individual of their relative risk of being infected with the virus, which Mila claimed would empower citizens to make informed decisions about their movement and allow for a data-driven approach to public health policy; all the while ensuring data is safeguarded from governments, companies, and individuals. This article will provide a critical response to Mila's COVI White Paper. Specifically, this article will discuss: the extent to which diversity has been considered in the design of the app, assumptions surrounding users' interaction with the app and the app's utility, as well as unanswered questions surrounding transparency, accountability, and security. We see this as an opportunity to supplement the excellent risk analysis done by the COVI team to surface insights that can be applied to other contact- and proximity-tracing apps that are being developed and deployed across the world.

227836,Identification of Kidney Transplant Recipients with Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"The prevention and control of infectious diseases is crucial to the maintenance and protection of social and public healthcare. The global impact of SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated how outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging infections can lead to pandemics of significant public health and socio-economic burden. Vaccination is one of the most effective approaches to protect against infectious diseases, and to date, multiple vaccines have been successfully used to protect against and eradicate both viral and bacterial pathogens. The main criterion of vaccine efficacy is the induction of specific humoral and cellular immune responses, and it is well established that immunogenicity depends on the type of vaccine as well as the route of delivery. In addition, antigen delivery to immune organs and the site of injection can potentiate efficacy of the vaccine. In light of this, microvesicles have been suggested as potential vehicles for antigen delivery as they can carry various immunogenic molecules including proteins, nucleic acids and polysaccharides directly to target cells. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms of microvesicle biogenesis and the role of microvesicles in infectious diseases. Further, we discuss the application of microvesicles as a novel and effective vaccine delivery system.","Shkair, Layaly; Garanina, Ekaterina E; Stott, Robert J; Foster, Toshana L; Rizvanov, Albert A; Khaiboullina, Svetlana F",Int. j. mol. sci.

Purpose To analyze the prognostic value of a chest radiograph severity scoring system for younger (nonelderly) patients with COVID-19 at initial presentation to the emergency department (ED); outcomes of interest included hospitalization, intubation, prolonged stay, sepsis, and death. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, patients between the ages of 21 and 50 years who presented to the ED of an urban multicenter health system from March 10 to March 26, 2020, with COVID-19 confirmation on real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were identified. Each patient's ED chest radiograph was divided into six zones and examined for opacities by two cardiothoracic radiologists, and scores were collated into a total concordant lung zone severity score. Clinical and laboratory variables were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between clinical parameters, chest radiograph scores, and patient outcomes. Results The study included 338 patients: 210 men (62%), with median age of 39 years (interquartile range, 31-45 years). After adjustment for demographics and comorbidities, independent predictors of hospital admission (n = 145, 43%) were chest radiograph severity score of 2 or more (odds ratio, 6.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.5, 11; P < .001) and obesity (odds ratio, 2.4 [95% CI: 1.1, 5.4] or morbid obesity). Among patients who were admitted, a chest radiograph score of 3 or more was an independent predictor of intubation (n = 28) (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% CI: 1.8, 13; P = .002) as was hospital site. No significant difference was found in primary outcomes across race and ethnicity or those with a history of tobacco use, asthma, or diabetes mellitus type II. Conclusion For patients aged 21-50 years with coronavirus disease 2019 presenting to the emergency department, a chest radiograph severity score was predictive of risk for hospital admission and intubation. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.","Toussie, Danielle; Voutsinas, Nicholas; Finkelstein, Mark; Cedillo, Mario A; Manna, Sayan; Maron, Samuel Z; Jacobi, Adam; Chung, Michael; Bernheim, Adam; Eber, Corey; Concepcion, Jose; Fayad, Zahi A; Gupta, Yogesh Sean",Radiology,,515

We argue that while masking offers a measure of protection from infection, its moral, political, and affective implications produce two main collateral risks. These are: (1) the heightening of social boundaries, which thus increase the potential of conflict between different social groups;and (2) the impairment of normative interaction rituals followed by a dynamic of distancing, insulation, and social alienation. While we stop short from constructing a hierarchy of risks, we do argue that policy makers should consider these collateral risks as part of any large-scale Covid-19 risk mitigation and communication strategy. We thus provide some principled guidance on how that might be done. © 2021 The Author(s).

A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to evaluate the latest evidence on the association of ECG on admission and the poor outcomes in COVID-19. Methods A literature search was conducted on online databases for observational studies evaluating ECG parameters and composite poor outcomes comprising ICU admission, severe illness, and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Results A total of 2,539 patients from seven studies were included in this analysis. Pooled analysis showed that a longer corrected QT (QTc) interval and more frequent prolonged QTc interval were associated with composite poor outcome ([WMD 6.04 [2.62-9.45], P = .001;I2:0%] and [RR 1.89 [1.52-2.36], P &lt; .001;I2:17%], respectively).

233445,Host tolerance contributes to persistent viral shedding in COVID-19,2020,"Introduction La Guyane française a fait face à une première vague significative l’été 2020, quelques mois après la métropole. L’étude EpiCovid a révélé que 25 % des guyanais avaient été touchés par le COVID. Les soignants, comme ailleurs, ont fait partie des populations significativement impactées par l’épidémie. Après l’autorisation du vaccin à ARNm Comirnaty® par l’Agence européenne du médicament fin décembre, la métropole a commencé à vacciner dans les EHPAD. L’arrivée des vaccins a été retardée de 15 jours en Guyane du fait de l’attente de l’arrivée d’un congélateur à −80°C à l’hôpital de Cayenne. Dès le début de la campagne vaccinale dans les EHPAD et auprès des soignants, des réticences vis-à-vis du vaccin ont été exprimées. La vaccination était accessible à tous les soignants de plus de 50 ans ou avec comorbidités au moment de l’enquête. Dans le contexte de l’émergence du variant 20J/501Y.V3 en Amérique du Sud, une meilleure compréhension des attitudes et de l’intention vaccinale des professionnels de santé de ce territoire particulier est susceptible d’aider à l’ajustement de la campagne. Matériels et méthodes Une enquête épidémiologique transversale a été mis en place en février et mars 2021 à destination de l’ensembles des soignants de Guyane à l’aide d’un questionnaire en ligne sur le site wepi.org, diffusé par mailing larges en partenariat avec les structures de santé du territoire, les URPS et les ordres médecins et infirmiers, la lettre de l’ARS, les groupes What'sApp de professionnels, sous forme de QR code affichés et sur les fonds d’écran des ordinateurs professionnels et sur support papier dans les services du CH de Cayenne et les 17 centres délocalisés de prévention et de soins (CDPS) des communes de l’intérieur. Résultats Au total, 578 professionnels de santé ont répondu à l’enquête, dont 42 % de médecins ou sage femmes, 37 % d’infirmiers et 20 % d’autres professionnels de santé. Les médecins et les infirmiers exerçaient en libéral (30 % et 23 %), en milieu hospitalier (48 % et 51 %) et en CDPS (10 % et 18 %, respectivement). Dans l’ensemble, 91 % des soignants interrogés se déclaraient favorables aux vaccinations en général, mais 26 % défavorables à certains vaccins. Concernant la vaccination contre le COVID-19, 65 % étaient déjà vaccinés ou envisageaient probablement de se faire vacciner, 11 % étaient indécis et 24 % déclaraient ne pas vouloir se faire vacciner. L’intention vaccinale était plus élevée parmi les médecins (87 %) que parmi les infirmiers et les autres professions de santé (50 % et 46 %, p&lt;0,001). Le refus du vaccin n’était pas différent selon le mode d’exercice, libéral ou hospitalier. L’opposition au vaccin était plus fréquente parmi les femmes (30 %), les moins de 35 ans (37 %) et parmi les professionnels de santé originaires de Guyane et des Antilles françaises (48 %). Ces facteurs restaient associés en analyse multivariée par régression logistique. À l’inverse, parmi les professionnels originaires de métropole ou de l’étranger, elle n’était pas différente en fonction de l’ancienneté d’arrivée en Guyane (qui était en médiane de 8 ans, IIQ [19–2]). Elle ne variait pas non plus en fonction du lieu d’exercice. Conclusion Les intentions vaccinales des professionnels de santé de Guyane française dans la période initiale de mise à disposition des vaccins sont assez contrastées, avec près d’un soignant sur quatre ne souhaitant pas se faire vacciner.","Vignier, N.; Brureau, K.; Granier, S.; Breton, J.; Agostini, C.; Epelboin, L.; Valdes, A.; Abboud, P.; Djossou, F.; Douine, M.",Infectious Diseases Now,,515

Nanomedicines have an advantage of providing enhanced permeability and retention and have been extensively studied as targeted drug delivery strategies for the treatment of different disease. The role of monocytes, erythrocytes, thrombocytes, and macrophages in diseases, including infectious and inflammatory diseases, cancer, and atherosclerosis, are better understood and have resulted in improved strategies for targeting and in some instances mimicking these cell types to improve therapeutic outcomes. Consequently, these primary cell types can be exploited for the purposes of serving as a ""Trojan horse"" for targeted delivery to identified organs and sites of inflammation. State of the art and potential utilization of nanocarriers such as nanospheres/nanocapsules, nanocrystals, liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles/nano-structured lipid carriers, dendrimers, and nanosponges for biomimicry and/or targeted delivery of bioactives to cells are reported herein and their potential use in the treatment of COVID-19 infections discussed.

239761,The role of biosensors in coronavirus disease-2019 outbreak,2020,"BACKGROUND: At the time of this writing, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak has already put tremendous strain on many countries' citizens, resources, and economies around the world. Social distancing measures, travel bans, self-quarantines, and business closures are changing the very fabric of societies worldwide. With people forced out of public spaces, much of the conversation about these phenomena now occurs online on social media platforms like Twitter. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we describe a multilingual COVID-19 Twitter data set that we are making available to the research community via our COVID-19-TweetIDs GitHub repository. METHODS: We started this ongoing data collection on January 28, 2020, leveraging Twitter's streaming application programming interface (API) and Tweepy to follow certain keywords and accounts that were trending at the time data collection began. We used Twitter's search API to query for past tweets, resulting in the earliest tweets in our collection dating back to January 21, 2020. RESULTS: Since the inception of our collection, we have actively maintained and updated our GitHub repository on a weekly basis. We have published over 123 million tweets, with over 60% of the tweets in English. This paper also presents basic statistics that show that Twitter activity responds and reacts to COVID-19-related events. CONCLUSIONS: It is our hope that our contribution will enable the study of online conversation dynamics in the context of a planetary-scale epidemic outbreak of unprecedented proportions and implications. This data set could also help track COVID-19-related misinformation and unverified rumors or enable the understanding of fear and panic-and undoubtedly more.","Chen, Emily; Lerman, Kristina; Ferrara, Emilio",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,515

242581,Therapeutic targets of natural products for the management of cardiovascular symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019,2021,"Coronavirus 2019 has become a highly infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, a strain of novel coronavirus, which challenges millions of global healthcare facilities. Coronavirus are sub-microscopic, single stranded positive sense RNA viruses that leads to multi organ dysfunction syndrome, severe acute and chronic respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia. The spike glycoprotein structure of the virus causes the viral protein to bind with the receptors on the lung and gut through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. In some cases, the infected patients become hyper to the immune system because of the uncontrolled production of cytokines resulting in ""cytokine storm"", a devastating consequence of coronavirus disease 2019. Due to the rapid mutant strain and infective nature of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, discovering a drug or developing a vaccine remains a global challenge. However, some anti-viral agents, certain protease inhibitor drugs, non-steroidal inflammatory drugs and convalescent plasma treatment were suggested. The containment and social distancing measures only aim at reducing the rate of new infections. In this view, we suggest certain traditional herbs and complementary and alternative medicine as a supporting public healthcare measure to boost the immune system and also may provide some lead to treat and prevent this infection.","Sundaravadivelu, Sumathi Kandasamy Swathi Kanagaraj Suganya Balraj Sudha Arumugam Poornima Dharmalingam Hamsa Banupriya S.

245681,Egypt's second wave of coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic and its impact on patients with inflammatory bowel disease,2021,"Introduction: While pharmacists in other countries have broad independent prescribing privileges, pharmacists in the United States are making progress. Pharmacist prescriptive authority in the U.S. occurs on a continuum with four identified models: patient-specific collaborative prescribing through collaborative practice agreements (CPAs), population-specific prescribing through CPAs, statewide protocols, and class-specific prescribing. States have implemented pharmacist prescriptive authority across this spectrum. As approximately 90% of Americans reside within two miles of a community pharmacy, prescriptive authority of pharmacists leads to improved public health access points and outcomes. Objective: This paper is intended to provide insight into the current landscape of pharmacist prescriptive authority in the United States through 2019 in order to provide historical context and identify opportunities for state policy considerations. This was done through a review of published literature, national professional association resources, individual state pharmacy practice acts, and state legislation and regulations. Conclusion: Significant variability regarding what medications pharmacists can prescribe exists per state statutes. According to data collected from the National Alliance of State Pharmacy Associations (NASPA), 147 bills related to pharmacist provider status were introduced in 39 states during the 2019 legislative session. The interest in pharmacist prescribing stems from current and future challenges within the U.S. health care system: access to care, cost of care, and the anticipated shortage of physicians. The challenge to standardize prescriptive authority across states presents a unique opportunity for future considerations. This article is protected by copyright.

245976,"Infection status of coronavirus disease 2019 cases and close contacts in Fuzhou, Fujian",2020,"We report that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) with viral RNA. N-protein condenses with specific RNA genomic elements under physiological buffer conditions and condensation is enhanced at human body temperatures (33°C and 37°C) and reduced at room temperature (22°C). RNA sequence and structure in specific genomic regions regulate N-protein condensation while other genomic regions promote condensate dissolution, potentially preventing aggregation of the large genome. At low concentrations, N-protein preferentially crosslinks to specific regions characterized by single-stranded RNA flanked by structured elements and these features specify the location, number, and strength of N-protein binding sites (valency). Liquid-like N-protein condensates form in mammalian cells in a concentration-dependent manner and can be altered by small molecules. Condensation of N-protein is RNA sequence and structure specific, sensitive to human body temperature, and manipulatable with small molecules, and therefore presents a screenable process for identifying antiviral compounds effective against SARS-CoV-2.","Iserman, Christiane; Roden, Christine A; Boerneke, Mark A; Sealfon, Rachel S G; McLaughlin, Grace A; Jungreis, Irwin; Fritch, Ethan J; Hou, Yixuan J; Ekena, Joanne; Weidmann, Chase A; Theesfeld, Chandra L; Kellis, Manolis; Troyanskaya, Olga G; Baric, Ralph S; Sheahan, Timothy P; Weeks, Kevin M; Gladfelter, Amy S",Mol. cell,,515

In attempts to ameliorate poorer student outcomes, some states have investigated the impact of mental health on those enrolled in higher education as well as the needs for supports and services for those impacted (e.g., Oregon Higher Education Coordinating Commission [OHECC], Office of Academic Policy and Authorization, 2018). However, despite these initiatives, limited empirical research is available related to the lived experiences of individuals with mental health challenges in higher education settings; including the supports and barriers they may experience while navigating these complex settings. This study begins to address this knowledge gap by using qualitative content analysis to examine and compare key stakeholder lived experiences related to mental health challenges in higher education, including the similarities and differences regarding service and support needs, determinants to usage (support and barriers), and recommendations for future research and improving the continuum of care.

Methods: Data from COVID-19 patients were collected at admission time to our hospital. Differential biochemical factors were identified between seriously ill patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission (ICU patients) versus stable patients without the need for ICU admission (non-ICU patients). Multiple linear regression was applied, then a predictive model of severity called Age-AST-D dimer (AAD) was constructed (n = 166) and validated (n = 170). Results: Derivation cohort: from 166 patients included, there were 27 (16.3%) ICU patients that showed higher levels of liver injury markers (P < 0.01) compared with non-ICU patients: alanine aminotrasnferase (ALT) 225.4 ± 341.2 vs. 41.3 ± 41.1, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 325.3 ± 382.4 vs. 52.8 ± 47.1, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) 764.6 ± 401.9 vs. 461.0 ± 185.6, D-dimer (DD) 7765 ± 9109 vs. 1871 ± 4146, and age 58.6 ± 12.7 vs. 49.1 ± 12.8.

OBJECTIVES: Measure the period prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among a random sample of asymptomatic health system hospital-based health care workers (HCWs) 6½ -15½ weeks after 4/5/2020, the peak of the first surge of COVID-19 admissions. RESULTS: Of 524 eligible and consented participants from four metropolitan hospitals, nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from 439 (83.8 %) and blood from 374 (71.4 %). Using PCR nucleic acid-based amplification (NAAT) methods, the period prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.23 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.01 %-1.28 %; 1/439) from 5/21/20-7/16/20. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies from June 17-July 24, 2020 was 2.41 % (95 % CI 1.27 %-4.51 %; 9/374). Those who were reactive were younger (median age 36 versus 44 years; p = 0.050), and those with self-reported Hispanic/Latino ethnicity had a higher seroprevalence (2/12 = 16.7 % versus 7/352 = 2.0 %; p = 0.051). There were no significant differences by sex, race, residence, hospital, unit or job type. The one employee who was found to be PCR test positive in this study was also reactive for IgG antibodies, tested 27 days later. CONCLUSIONS: The period prevalence of PCR positivity to SARS-CoV-2 and IgG seroprevalence was unexpectedly low in asymptomatic HCWs after a peak in COVID-19 admissions and the establishment of state and institutional infection control policies, suggesting that routine screening tests while community prevalence is relatively low would produce a minimal yield.","Johnson, Christine C; Coleman, Chad M; Sitarik, Alexandra R; Leon, Joyce E; Tibbetts, Robert J; Cook, Bernard C; Muma, Bruce K; Weinmann, Allison J; Samuel, Linoj P",J Clin Virol,,515

This study aimed to detect by RT-PCR the presence of SARS-CoV-2 from inert surface samples in public health settings with a literature review about surface contamination and its burden on spread virus. Samples were collected from health settings in Curitiba, Brazil, between July and December 2020. A literature review was conducted using PRISMA. A total of 711 environmental surface samples were collected from outpatient areas, dental units, doctors' offices, COVID-19 evaluation areas, and hospital units, of which 35 (4.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The frequency of environmental contamination was higher in primary care units than in hospital settings. The virus was detected on doctors' personal items. Remarkably, the previously disinfected dental chair samples tested positive. These findings agree with those of other studies in which SARS-CoV-2 was found on inanimate surfaces. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces in public health settings, including those not meant to treat COVID-19, indicates widespread environmental contamination. Therefore, the intensification of disinfection measures for external hospital areas may be important for controlling community COVID-19 dissemination.","Vicente, V. A.; Lustosa, B. P.

249089,Reduced frequency of T helper 17 and T helper 1 cells and their association with critical coronavirus disease 2019,2021,"COVID-19 is one of the fatal pandemic throughout the world. For cellular fusion, its antigenic peptides are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in humans. Therefore, exploration into residual interaction details of CoV2 with MHCs shall be a promising point for instigating the vaccine development. Envelope (E) protein, the smallest outer surface protein from SARS-CoV2 genome was found to possess the highest antigenicity and is therefore used to identify B-cell and T-cell epitopes. Four novel mutations (T55S, V56F, E69R and G70del) were observed in E-protein of SARS-CoV2 after evolutionary analysis. It showed a coilâhelix transition in the protein conformation. Antigenic variability of the epitopes was also checked to explore the novel mutations in the epitope region. It was found that the interactions were more when SARS-CoV2 E-protein interacted with MHC-I than with MHC-II through several ionic and H-bonds. Tyr42 and Tyr57 played a predominant role upon interaction with MHC-I. The higher &#916;G values with lesser dissociation constant values also affirm the stronger and spontaneous interaction by SARS-CoV2 proteins with MHCs. On comparison with the consensus E-protein, SARS-CoV2 E-protein showed stronger interaction with the MHCs with lesser solvent accessibility. E-protein can therefore be targeted as a potential vaccine target against SARS-CoV2.","Bhattacharya, Shreya; Banerjee, Arundhati; Ray, Sujay",Int. j. biol. macromol,,515

AIM: To determine if there is an improvement in the quality of life in patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer undergoing physical exercise. METHODS: A systematic literature review was carried out; non-randomized clinical trials of any year were included from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and VHL platforms, without specific language delimitation, and analyzed the influence of physical exercise on the quality of life of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer, and for analysis of bias, the Cochrane Manual for the Development of Systematic Intervention Reviews was used. RESULTS: Four studies were analyzed in full to produce the results; of these, three intervened with unsupervised aerobic exercises and one with semi-supervised aerobic exercises, all used the FACT-C as a questionnaire to assess quality of life, some even used FACT-G and/or SF-12, and only one author found significance values in the variables of physical well-being, emotional well-being, and functional well-being of the questionnaire, compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: There were no significant increases in the quality of life of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer compared with the control group.","da Silva Bezerra, Kleber Henrique; de Oliveira, Marcelo Vaughan Lima; do Nascimento, Israel Junior Borges; de Barros Rocha, Letícia; de Souza Filho, Luiz Euclides Coelho; Rocha, Rodrigo Santiago Barbosa; da Silva, Marianne Lucena; da Costa Cunha, Katiane",,,515

This study used data from the first wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Emotional Well-Being Study, a prospective panel study examining the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and includes a sample of 181 social workers. We conducted univariate analyses. Over a quarter (26.21%) of social workers met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD and 16.22% reported severe grief symptoms. While 99.19% of the sample reported average to high compassion satisfaction, 63.71% reported average burnout and 49.59% reported average secondary trauma. Findings indicate that social workers are reporting higher than national estimates of PTSD, indicating a greater need for more emotional support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the significance and severity of the pandemic, it is essential that organizations provide resources for both immediate and ongoing support for the emotional well-being of their employees.","Holmes, Megan R; Rentrope, C Robin; Korsch-Williams, Amy; King, Jennifer A",Clin Soc Work J,,515

By simulation and data fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59 769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with the coefficient of determination close to 1 and the fitting bias 3.02%, suggesting high precision of the data-fitting results. More rigorous government control policies were associated with a slower increase in the infected population. Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of the treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance. There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound, and another continuous decline. The feature of high infectiousness for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) led to an upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions. Evidence from the four-phase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients' being admitted to designated hospitals, and comprehensive therapeutic strategy. Collaborative efforts are required to combat the novel coronavirus, focusing on both persistent strict domestic interventions and vigilance against exogenous imported cases.","Fang, Yaqing; Nie, Yiting; Penny, Marshare",J Med Virol,,515

Several remote monitoring techniques have been developed for early detection of worsening disease, potentially limiting the number of hospitalizations. Over the last years, the scope has been shifting towards the relatively novel invasive sensors capable of measuring intracardiac filling pressures, because it is believed that hemodynamic congestion precedes clinical congestion. Monitoring intracardiac pressures may therefore enable clinicians to intervene and avert hospitalizations in a pre-symptomatic phase. Several techniques have been discussed in this review, and thus far, remote monitoring of pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) by the CardioMEMS (CardioMicroelectromechanical system) HF System is the only technique with proven safety as well as efficacy with regard to the prevention of HF-related hospital admissions. Efforts are currently aimed to further develop existing techniques and new sensors capable of measuring left atrial pressures (LAP). With the growing body of evidence and need for remote care, it is expected that remote monitoring by invasive sensors will play a larger role in HF care in the near future.","Radhoe, Sumant P; Veenis, Jesse F; Brugts, Jasper J",Sensors (Basel),,515

We aimed to assess the more recent nationwide seroprevalence in the general population in India. METHODS: We did a second household serosurvey among individuals aged 10 years or older in the same 700 villages or wards within 70 districts in India that were included in the first serosurvey. Individuals aged younger than 10 years and households that did not respond at the time of survey were excluded. Participants were interviewed to collect information on sociodemographics, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, exposure history to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, and history of COVID-19 illness. 3-5 mL of venous blood was collected from each participant and blood samples were tested using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Seroprevalence was estimated after applying the sampling weights and adjusting for clustering and assay characteristics. We randomly selected one adult serum sample from each household to compare the seroprevalence among adults between the two serosurveys. FINDINGS: Between Aug 18 and Sept 20, 2020, we enrolled and collected serum samples from 29â082 individuals from 15â613 households. The weighted and adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in individuals aged 10 years or older was 6·6% (95% CI 5·8-7·4). Among 15â084 randomly selected adults (one per household), the weighted and adjusted seroprevalence was 7·1% (6·2-8·2). Seroprevalence was similar across age groups, sexes, and occupations. Seroprevalence was highest in urban slum areas followed by urban non-slum and rural areas. We estimated a cumulative 74·3 million infections in the country by Aug 18, 2020, with 26-32 infections for every reported COVID-19 case. INTERPRETATION: Approximately one in 15 individuals aged 10 years or older in India had SARS-CoV-2 infection by Aug 18, 2020. The adult seroprevalence increased approximately tenfold between May and August, 2020. Lower infection-to-case ratio in August than in May reflects a substantial increase in testing across the country.

METHODS: Patients with PE and confirmed aetiology who underwent diagnostic thoracentesis were included in this study. One retrospective set (N = 1261) was used to develop and internally validate the predictive model. The clinical, radiological and laboratory features were collected and subjected to logistic regression analyses. The primary predictive model was displayed as a nomogram and then modified into a novel scoring system, which was externally validated in an independent set (N = 172). FINDINGS: The novel scoring system was composed of fever (3 points), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (4 points), effusion adenosine deaminase (7 points), serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (4 points), effusion CEA (10 points) and effusion/serum CEA (8 points). With a cutoff value of 15 points, the area under the curve, specificity and sensitivity for identifying MPE were 0.913, 89.10%, and 82.63%, respectively, in the training set, 0.922, 93.48%, 81.51%, respectively, in the internal validation set and 0.912, 87.61%, 81.36%, respectively, in the external validation set. Moreover, this scoring system was exclusively applied to distinguish lung cancer with PE from tuberculous pleurisy and showed a favourable diagnostic performance in the training and validation sets.

262945,Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the Pediatric Gastroenterologist,2020,"Introduction: Older adults, who already have higher levels of social isolation, loneliness, and sedentary behavior, are particularly susceptible to negative impacts from social distancing mandates meant to control the spread of COVID-19. We sought to explore the physical, mental, and social health impacts of the pandemic on older adults and their coping techniques. Materials and Methods: We conducted 25 semi-structured interviews with a sub-sample of participants in an ongoing sedentary behavior reduction intervention. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, and iterative coding was used to extract key themes. Results: Most participants reported an increase in sedentary behavior due to limitations on leaving their home and increased free time to pursue seated hobbies (e.g., reading, knitting, tv). However, many participants also reported increased levels of intentional physical activity and exercise, particularly outdoors or online. Participants also reported high levels of stress and a large decrease in in-person social connection. Virtual connection with others through phone and video was commonly used to stay connected with friends and family, engage in community groups and activities, and cope with stress and social isolation. Maintenance of a positive attitude and perspective gained from past hardships was also an important coping strategy for many participants. Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing measures have impacted older adults' perceived levels of activity, stress, and social isolation, but many leveraged technology and prior life experiences to cope. These themes could inform future interventions for older adults dealing with chronic stress and isolation.","Greenwood-Hickman, Mikael Anne; Dahlquist, Jacklyn; Cooper, Julie; Holden, Erika; McClure, Jennifer B; Mettert, Kayne D; Perry, Stephen R; Rosenberg, Dori E",Front Public Health,,515

264593,The role of peripheral blood eosinophil counts in COVID-19 patients,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the highly contagious illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The standard diagnostic testing procedure for COVID-19 is testing a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can take multiple days to provide a diagnosis. Another widespread form of testing is rapid antigen testing, which has a low sensitivity compared to PCR, but is favored for its quick diagnosis time of usually 15-30 minutes. Patients who test positive for COVID-19 demonstrate diffuse alveolar damage in 87% of cases. Machine learning has proven to have advantages in image classification problems with radiology. In this work, we introduce CovXR as a machine learning model designed to detect COVID-19 pneumonia in chest X-rays (CXR). CovXR is a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on over 4,300 chest X-rays. The performance of the model is measured through accuracy, F1 score, sensitivity, and specificity. The model achieves an accuracy of 95.5% and an F1 score of 0.954. The sensitivity is 93.5% and specificity is 97.5%. With accuracy above 95% and F1 score above 0.95, CovXR is highly accurate in predicting COVID-19 pneumonia on CXRs. The model achieves better accuracy than prior work and uses a unique approach to identify COVID-19 pneumonia. CovXR is highly accurate in identifying COVID-19 on CXRs of patients with a PCR confirmed positive diagnosis and provides much faster results than PCR tests.","Shenoy, Vishal; Malik, Sachin B.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06398v1.pdf,515

The objective of the study was to estimate the prevalence and geographic distribution of IgG antibodies induced by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic adults, 5-8 months after the first case was reported in a northeastern state of Mexico. This was a population-based cross-sectional study carried out in Nuevo Leon during August-November 2020. Individuals &#8805;18 years with no previous diagnosis or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 were consecutively screened in one of the busiest subway stations. Also, a search for eligible individuals was done from house-to-house, after selecting densely populated geographic sectors of each of the municipalities of the metropolitan area (n = 4495). The IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein were analyzed. The IgG antibody positivity rate was 27.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 25.8, 28.4); there were no differences by sex or age (p > 0.05). Analysis by month showed a gradual increase from 11.9% (August) to 31.9% (November); Week 39 had the highest positivity rate (42.2%, 95% CI: 34.2, 50.7).

The importance of obesity as a risk factor for poor prognosis in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection has recently been demonstrated. This review examines a possible relationship between obesity, psoriasis, and COVID-19, analyzing the pathophysiological links and their practical implications. On the one hand, a higher body mass index increases the risk of psoriasis and is also a factor in metabolic syndrome, which is common in patients with psoriasis and has been implicated in reducing the effectiveness of psoriasis treatments. On the other hand, obesity is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 and mortality. Obesity also promotes a proinflammatory state in the lung, where it compromises respiratory mechanics.","Llamas-Velasco, M; Ovejero-Merino, E; Salgado-Boquete, L",,,515

We investigated mortality rates, overall and according to location, in patients with established cardiovascular disease before, during, and after these lockdown measures. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified a dynamic cohort comprising all Danish citizens with cardiovascular disease (i.e. a history of ischaemic heart disease, ischaemic stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or peripheral artery disease) alive on 2 January 2019 and 2020. The cohort was followed from 2 January 2019/2020 until death or 16/15 October 2019/2020. The cohort comprised 340 392 and 347 136 patients with cardiovascular disease in 2019 and 2020, respectively. The overall, in-hospital, and out-of-hospital mortality rate in 2020 before lockdown was significantly lower compared with the same period in 2019 [adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) CI 0.87-0.95; IRR 0.95, 95% CI 0.89-1.02; and IRR 0.87, 95% CI 0.83-0.93, respectively]. The overall mortality rate during and after lockdown was not significantly different compared with the same period in 2019 (IRR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97-1.02). However, the in-hospital mortality rate was lower and out-of-hospital mortality rate higher during and after lockdown compared with the same period in 2019 (in-hospital, IRR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.96; out-of-hospital, IRR 1.04, 95% CI1.01-1.08). These trends were consistent irrespective of sex and age. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with established cardiovascular disease, the in-hospital mortality rate was lower and out-of-hospital mortality rate higher during lockdown compared with the same period in the preceding year, irrespective of age and sex.","Butt, Jawad H; Fosbøl, Emil L; Gerds, Thomas A; Andersson, Charlotte; Kragholm, Kristian; Biering-Sørensen, Tor; Andersen, Julie; Phelps, Mathew; Andersen, Mikkel Porsborg; Gislason, Gunnar; Torp-Pedersen, Christian; Køber, Lars; Schou, Morten",Eur Heart J,,515

Objectives: Early epidemiological investigations found that the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic was more critical in Hubei province (Hubei) than in rest parts of mainland China (Rest of China). A cross-sectional study was conducted to answer this urgent question and provide implications for the world. Methods: Infected cases from Mainland China were divided into two groups: Hubei and the Rest of China. Prevention, quarantine, and treatment were basedonThe Novel Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Standards. Totalconfirmedcases, daily severe cases, total deaths, and total discharged cases were collected from January 20 to March 4 for statistical analysis. Results: Hubei accounted for 83.9% of China's total confirmed cases and 96.3% of China's total deaths. The percentage of severe cases and the rate of fatality in Hubei were higher than those in the Rest of China (P &lt; 0.01). Daily severe cases in Hubei hit the peak at 11, 246 cases on February 18, compared to 989 cases on February 10 in the Rest of China. The percentages of daily severe cases in both regions declined throughout the epidemic, from 23.3% to 8.6% in Hubei compared to 15.0% to 1.3% in the Rest of China. The latest fatality rate in Hubei was 4.30%, which was much higher than 0.85% in the Rest of China. Up to March 4, 64.7% of China's total confirmed cases were cured, 3.86% died, and 31.5% were under treatment. Conclusions: The implications for the world are cutting off the sources of infection and transmission routes, early detection, early isolation, and early treatment that can prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the severity and fatality rate.","Ke, Youfu; Chen, Zemin; Peng, Bo",Iran.

The PCR tests for COVID-19 detection are not available in many countries, and also, there are genuine concerns about their reliability and performance. Motivated by these shortcomings, this article proposes a deep uncertainty-aware transfer learning framework for COVID-19 detection using medical images. Four popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet121, and InceptionResNetV2, are first applied to extract deep features from chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images. Extracted features are then processed by different machine learning and statistical modeling techniques to identify COVID-19 cases. We also calculate and report the epistemic uncertainty of classification results to identify regions where the trained models are not confident about their decisions (out of distribution problem). Comprehensive simulation results for X-ray and CT image data sets indicate that linear support vector machine and neural network models achieve the best results as measured by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Also, it is found that predictive uncertainty estimates are much higher for CT images compared to X-ray images.","Shamsi, Afshar; Asgharnezhad, Hamzeh; Jokandan, Shirin Shamsi; Khosravi, Abbas; Kebria, Parham M; Nahavandi, Darius; Nahavandi, Saeid; Srinivasan, Dipti",IEEE Trans Neural Netw Learn Syst,,515
287250,Coronavirus Disease 2019 versus Influenza A in Children: An Observational Control Study in China,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and unprecedented global demand, clinicians are struggling to source adequate access to personal protective equipment. Respirators can be in short supply, though are necessary to protect workers from SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Rapid decontamination and reuse of respirators may provide relief for the strained procurement situation. METHOD: In this study, we investigated the suitability of 70°C dry heat and microwave-generated steam (MGS) for reprocessing of FFP2/N95-type respirators, and Type-II surgical face masks. Staphylococcus aureus was used as a surrogate as it is less susceptible than enveloped viruses to chemical and physical processes. RESULTS: We observed >4 log10 reductions in the viability of dry S. aureus treated by dry heat for 90 min at 70°C and >6 log10 reductions by MGS for 90 s. After 3 reprocessing cycles, neither process was found to negatively impact the bacterial or NaCl filtration efficiency of the respirators that were tested. However, MGS was incompatible with Type-II surgical masks tested, as we confirmed that bacterial filtration capacity was completely lost following reprocessing. MGS was observed to be incompatible with some respirator types due to arcing observed around some types of metal nose clips and by loss of adhesion of clips to the mask. CONCLUSION: Considering the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, we propose a reprocessing personal protective equipment/face mask workflow for use in medical areas.","Pascoe, M J; Robertson, A; Crayford, A; Durand, E; Steer, J; Castelli, A; Wesgate, R; Evans, S L; Porch, A; Maillard, J-Y",J Hosp Infect,,515
287685,Comparative Survival Analysis of Immunomodulatory Therapy for Coronavirus Disease 2019 Cytokine Storm,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Older adults are at greater risk of both infection with and mortality from COVID-19. Many U.S. nursing homes have been devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic, yet little has been described regarding the typical disease course in this population. The objective of this study is to describe and identify patterns in the disease course of nursing home residents infected with COVID-19. SETTING AND METHODS: This is a case series of 74 residents with COVID-19 infection in a nursing home in central Indiana between March 28 and June 17, 2020. Data were extracted from the electronic medical record and from nursing home medical director tracking notes from the time of the index infection through August 31, 2020. The clinical authorship team reviewed the data to identify patterns in the disease course of the residents. RESULTS: The most common symptoms were fever, hypoxia, anorexia, and fatigue/malaise. The duration of symptoms was extended, with an average of over 3 weeks. Of those infected 25 died; 23 of the deaths were considered related to COVID-19 infection. A subset of residents with COVID-19 infection experienced a rapidly progressive, fatal course. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Nursing home residents infected with COVID-19 from the facility we studied experienced a prolonged disease course regardless of the severity of their symptoms, with implications for the resources needed to care for and support of these residents during active infection and post-disease. Future studies should combine data from nursing home residents across the country to identify the risk factors for disease trajectories identified in this case series.","Carnahan, Jennifer L; Lieb, Kristi M; Albert, Lauren; Wagle, Kamal; Kaehr, Ellen; Unroe, Kathleen T",J. am. geriatr. soc,,515

The OCN constructed from the experimentally verified genes exhibits fractal nature in the topological properties of the network and deeply rooted communities. Also, the network properties at all levels of organization obey one parameter scaling law which lacks centrality lethality rule. We then showed that $\langle k\rangle$ can be taken as a scaling parameter, where, power law exponent can be estimated from the ratio of network diameters, $\lambda=1+\rho\left[\frac{d_c}{d_k}\right]$. The betweenness centrality shows two distinct behaviors one shown by high degree hubs and the other by segregated low degree nodes. The $C_B$ distribution follows power law behavior with the exponent connected to exponents of distributions of high and low degree nodes by, $\theta\sim\left[1+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_s}+\frac{1}{\epsilon_h}\right)(\lambda-1)\right]$. Absence of rich-club formation leads to the missing of a number of attractors in the network causing formation of weakly tied diverse functional modules to keep optimal network efficiency. The hubs knockout experiment shows that provincial hubs take major responsibility to keep network integrity and organization. The identified key regulators are found to be provincial and connector hubs. Further, two key regulators, EPCAM and CD44 are found to be maximally over expressed at various cancer stages (II-IV). They are also positively correlated with immune infiltrates (CD4+ T cells). Finally, few potential drugs are identified related to the key regulators.","Chirom, Keilash; Malik, Md.

Secondarily, we aimed to examine how lifestyle and psychosocial well-being measures may influence running behavior change. An online survey was advertised to individuals over the age of 18 that currently run or have previously participated in running for exercise. The survey questions examined injury history and new injuries sustained during COVID-19 restrictions, as well as changes related to training behavior changes, training environment changes, social behaviors, and psychosocial well-being. Changes reflected differences in running behaviors prior to COVID-19 restrictions (1 month prior to COVID-19 restrictions being imposed) and during COVID-19 restrictions (May 5 to June 10, 2020). A total of 1,035 runners were included in the analysis. Current injuries sustained during COVID-19 occurred in 9.5% of the runners. Injured runners made a greater number of total changes (p = 0.031) as well as training-related (p = 0.042) and environment-related (p = 0.017) changes compared with uninjured runners. A significant relationship was found between injury and those that reported less time to exercise to changes in work environment (p = 0017). This study highlights the multi-dimensional nature of running-related injuries and the need to consider the interaction of multiple changes in running behavior, rather than isolating single factors. Greater understanding of the underlying causes of running-related injuries can help reduce the risk of future injury.","Holmes, H. H.; Monaghan, P. G.; Strunk, K. K.; Paquette, M. R.; Roper, J.

Administration of a third dose of an inactivated virus vaccine can boost the immune response. Here, we have dissected the immunogenic profiles of antibodies from 3-dose vaccinees, 2-dose vaccinees and convalescents. Better neutralization breadth to VOCs, expeditious recall and long-lasting humoral response bolster 3-dose vaccinees in warding off COVID-19. Analysis of 171 complex structures of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies identified structure-activity correlates, revealing ultrapotent, VOCs-resistant and broad-spectrum antigenic patches. Construction of immunogenic and mutational heat maps revealed a direct relationship between ""hot"" immunogenic sites and areas with high mutation frequencies. Ongoing antibody somatic mutation, memory B cell clonal turnover and antibody composition changes in B cell repertoire driven by prolonged and repeated antigen stimulation confer development of monoclonal antibodies with enhanced neutralizing potency and breadth.

295129,A review on medical management of inflammatory bowel disease during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,2020,"Abstract Objectives A major COVID-19 vaccine strategy is to induce antibodies that prevent interaction between the Spike protein's receptor-binding domain (RBD) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) These vaccines will also induce T-cell responses However, concerns were raised that aberrant vaccine-induced immune responses may exacerbate disease We aimed to identify minimal epitopes on the RBD that would induce antibody responses that block the interaction of the RBD and ACE2 as a strategy leading to an effective vaccine with reduced risk of inducing immunopathology Methods We procured a series of overlapping 20-amino acid peptides spanning the RBD and asked which were recognised by plasma from COVID-19 convalescent patients Identified epitopes were conjugated to diphtheria-toxoid and used to vaccinate mice Immune sera were tested for binding to the RBD and for their ability to block the interaction of the RBD and ACE2 Results Seven putative vaccine epitopes were identified Memory B-cells (MBCs) specific for one of the epitopes were identified in the blood of convalescent patients When used to vaccinate mice, six induced antibodies that bound recRBD and three induced antibodies that could partially block the interaction of the RBD and ACE2 However, when the sera were combined in pairs, we observed significantly enhanced inhibition of binding of RBD to ACE2 Two of the peptides were located in the main regions of the RBD known to contact ACE2 Of significant importance to vaccine development, two of the peptides were in regions that are invariant in the UK and South African strains Conclusion COVID-19 convalescent patients have SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and MBCs, the specificities of which can be defined with short peptides Epitope-specific antibodies synergistically block RBD?ACE2 interaction","Pandey, Manisha Ozberk Victoria Eskandari Sharareh Shalash Ahmed O.; Joyce, Michael A.; Saffran, Holly A.; Day, Christopher J.; Lepletier, Ailin Spillings Belinda L.; Mills, Jamie-Lee Calcutt Ainslie Fan Fan Williams James T.; Stanisic, Danielle I.; Hattingh, Laetitia Gerrard John Skwarczynski Mariusz Mak Johnson Jennings Michael P.; Toth, Istvan Tyrrell D.

Although official lockdowns were typically short-term and allowed people to leave their homes for exercise and essential activities, some individuals did not leave their home for prolonged periods due to a range of factors including clinical vulnerability. This study aimed to explore longitudinal patterns of such home confinement across different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, and its associated predictors and mental health outcomes. MethodsData were from the UCL COVID -19 Social Study. The analytical sample consisted of 25,390 adults in England who were followed up for 17 months from March 2020 to July 2021. Data were analysed using growth mixture models. ResultsOur analyses identified three classes of growth trajectories, including one class showing a high level of persistent home confinement (24.8%), one changing class with clear alignment with national containment policy/advice (32.0%), and one class with a persistently low level of confinement (43.1%). A range of factors were found to be associated the class membership of home confinement trajectories, such as age, gender, income, employment status, social relationships and health. The class with a high level of confinement had the highest number of depressive and anxiety symptoms at the end of the follow-up independent of potential confounders. ConclusionsThere was substantial heterogeneity in longitudinal patterns of home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a striking proportion of our sample maintained a high level of home confinement over the course of 17 months, even during periods when containment measures were eased or removed and when infection rates were low. They also had the worst mental health outcomes. This group warrants special attention in addressing the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bu, Feifei; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",,,515

Hence, we aim to investigate prevalence of cardiac injury and its impact on the outcomes in patients with COVID-19. HYPOTHESIS: Cardiac injury is common and associated with higher risk of death. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, MedRxiv, and EMBASE databases from December 2019 to July 15, 2020 for studies that evaluated the prevalence and impact of cardiac injury on COVID-19. This study has been registered with PROSPERO (International prospective register of systematic reviews)-registration number-CRD-42020186120. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies including 6297 participants were identified. The proportions of cardiac injury were 22%, 28% among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 or severe COVID-19 patients, respectively. The incidences of cardiac injury in advance age (>60 years) (30%) was about two-fold than young patients (<60 years) (15%) with COVID-19. Severe cases (42%) have seven-fold prevalence cardiac injury than in their non- severe counterparts (6%). Furthermore, cardiac injury is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19 (OR 10.11, 95% CI 4.49-22.77). In patients with severe COVID-19, cardiac injury is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (OR: 16.79, 95% CI: 5.52-51.02). CONCLUSIONS: This was the first meta-analysis exploring the prevalence and impact of cardiac injury on COVID-19. Cardiac injury is common in hospitalized patients and advanced age and severe COVID-19 patients prone to experience more risk of cardiac injury. Furthermore, cardiac injury is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality.","Fu, Linghua; Liu, Xiao; Su, Yuhao; Ma, Jianyong; Hong, Kui",Clin Cardiol,,515

310397,"Clinical and epidemiological features of 36 children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Zhejiang, China: an observational cohort study",2020,"BACKGROUND: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, urology was one of the specialties with the lowest rates of telemedicine and videoconferencing use. Common barriers to the implementation of telemedicine included a lack of technological literacy, concerns with reimbursement, and resistance to changes in the workplace. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic declared in March 2020, the delivery of urological services globally has quickly shifted to telemedicine to account for the mass clinical, procedural, and operative cancellations, inadequate personal protective equipment, and shortage of personnel. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate current telemedicine usage by urologists, urologists' perceptions on the necessity of in-person clinic appointments, the usability of telemedicine, and the current barriers to its implementation. METHODS: We conducted a global, cross-sectional, web-based survey to investigate the use of telemedicine before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Urologists' perceived usability of telemedicine was assessed using a modified Delphi approach to create questions based on a modified version of the validated Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ). For the purposes of this study, telemedicine was defined as video calls only. RESULTS: A total of 620 urologists from 58 different countries and 6 continents participated in the survey. Prior to COVID-19, 15.8% (n=98) of urologists surveyed were using telemedicine in their clinical practices; during the pandemic, that proportion increased to 46.1% (n=283). Of the urologists without telemedicine experience, interest in telemedicine usage increased from 43.7% (n=139) to 80.8% (n=257) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among urologists that used telemedicine during the pandemic, 80.9% (n=244) were interested in continuing to use it in their practice. The three most commonly used platforms were Zoom, Doxy.me, and Epic, and the top three barriers to implementing telemedicine were patients' lack of technological comprehension, patients' lack of access to the required technology, and reimbursement concerns. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to quantify the use, usability, and pervading interest in telemedicine among urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the face of this pandemic, urologists' usage of telemedicine nearly tripled, demonstrating their ability to adopt and adapt telemedicine into their practices, but barriers involving the technology itself are still preventing many from utilizing it despite increasing interest.","Dubin, Justin M; Wyant, W Austin; Balaji, Navin C; Ong, William Lk; Kettache, Reda H; Haffaf, Malik; Zouari, Skander; Santillan, Diego; Autrán Gómez, Ana Maria; Sadeghi-Nejad, Hossein; Loeb, Stacy; Borin, James F; Gomez Rivas, Juan; Grummet, Jeremy; Ramasamy, Ranjith; Teoh, Jeremy Y C",J Med Internet Res,,515

Data on immunogenicity and safety of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) are limited. METHODS: A multicentre observational study evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of the two-dose regimen BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in adult patients with AIIRD (n=686) compared with the general population (n=121). Serum IgG antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 spike S1/S2 proteins were measured 2-6 weeks after the second vaccine dose. Seropositivity was defined as IgG &#8805;15 binding antibody units (BAU)/mL. Vaccination efficacy, safety, and disease activity were assessed within 6 weeks after the second vaccine dose. RESULTS: Following vaccination, the seropositivity rate and S1/S2 IgG levels were significantly lower among patients with AIIRD versus controls (86% (n=590) vs 100%, p<0.0001 and 132.9±91.7 vs 218.6±82.06 BAU/mL, p<0.0001, respectively). Risk factors for reduced immunogenicity included older age and treatment with glucocorticoids, rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and abatacept. Rituximab was the main cause of a seronegative response (39% seropositivity). There were no postvaccination symptomatic cases of COVID-19 among patients with AIIRD and one mild case in the control group. Major adverse events in patients with AIIRD included death (n=2) several weeks after the second vaccine dose, non-disseminated herpes zoster (n=6), uveitis (n=2), and pericarditis (n=1). Postvaccination disease activity remained stable in the majority of patients. CONCLUSION: mRNA BNTb262 vaccine was immunogenic in the majority of patients with AIIRD, with an acceptable safety profile. Treatment with glucocorticoids, rituximab, MMF, and abatacept was associated with a significantly reduced BNT162b2-induced immunogenicity.","Furer, Victoria; Eviatar, Tali; Zisman, Devy; Peleg, Hagit; Paran, Daphna; Levartovsky, David; Zisapel, Michael; Elalouf, Ofir; Kaufman, Ilana; Meidan, Roni; Broyde, Adi; Polachek, Ari; Wollman, Jonathan; Litinsky, Ira; Meridor, Katya; Nochomovitz, Hila; Silberman, Adi; Rosenberg, Dana; Feld, Joy; Haddad, Amir; Gazzit, Tal; Elias, Muna; Higazi, Nizar; Kharouf, Fadi; Shefer, Gabi; Sharon, Orly; Pel, Sara; Nevo, Sharon; Elkayam, Ori",Ann. rheum. dis,,515

Methods: Using TCMSP, BATMAN, Swiss Target Prediction, and other databases, the chemical compounds and targets of XNJI were retrieved. Cytoscape software was used to construct XNJI efficacy network of ""drug-compounds-targets"" for coronavirus and neuroprotection, and the action mechanism was predicted by Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. Then core compounds were verified by molecular docking with 3CL Mpro, ACE2, and 2019-nCoV RBD/ACE2-B0AT1 complex. Results: A total of 105 active compounds of XNJI, 928 drug targets, 741 targets of coronavirus, 611 targets of neuroprotection, 83 drug-disease common targets, 12 core compounds, and seven key targets were obtained. The function enrichment analysis of GO yielded 204 entries, KEGG pathway enrichment screened 120 signaling pathways, which included Hepatitis B, pathways in cancer, TNF, HIF-1, and VEGF signaling pathway, and so on. The results of molecular docking showed that core compounds of XNJI had a good bonding activity with 3CL Mpro, ACE2 and complex. The chlorogenin and kaempferol had the lowest binding energy with three proteins and might play an important role in treatment. Conclusion: The core compounds in XNJI including chlorogenin, kaempferol, 5-hydroxy- 6,7,3',4',5'-pentamethoxyflavone, 3-methylkempferol, morin, gardenin, quercetin, artemisetin, genistein, dryobalanone, curcumin, and elemicin, which might interfere with various signaling pathways by acting on key targets like PARP1, PTGS2, MMP9, CDK2, ADORA2A, ALOX5, GSK3B, and regulate the inflammatory response, apoptosis, oxidative stress, angiogenesis, and other processes to improve the neurological damage caused by SARS-CoV-2, and inhibit virus replication and prevent infection of the host cell by binding with 3CL Mpro, ACE2 and complex, which suggest that XNJI may have a positive therapeutic effect on the neurological damage caused by SARS-CoV-2.","Xie, Li-Hua; Wang, Jin-Xi; Lin, Xiao-Yuan; Qin, Tian; Hu, Guo-Heng",Chin.

The contagious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was declared a pandemic following the outbreak of cases of respiratory illness in 2019. While studies assessed COVID-19 knowledge, attitude, and practice in Ethiopia the findings were highly variable and inconsistent.1, 2, 3, 4 Therefore, this study assessed the pooled status of knowledge, attitude, and prevention practices regarding COVID -19 in Ethiopia. Methods: International and national electronic databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Google, were systematically searched. All observational studies on COVID-19 knowledge, attitude, and prevention practices in Ethiopia were included. We assessed heterogeneity among the included studies using the Cochrane Q test statistics and I2 test. Lastly, a random-effects meta-analysis model was fitted to estimate the pooled proportion of knowledge, attitude, and prevention practices toward COVID-19 in Ethiopia. Results: Our search identified 206 studies, 13 of which were included in the final analysis. Adequate knowledge, good attitude, and good prevention practice towards COVID-19 in Ethiopia were observed in 70.25% (95% confidence interval [CI], 61.82, 78.02), 69.08% (95% CI: 55.42, 81.24), and 41.62% (95% CI: 27.77, 56.17) of total participants across studies, respectively. Conclusion: The results of this study revealed low proportions of adequate knowledge, attitudes, and preventive practices toward COVID-19 in Ethiopia. The lowest pooled proportion was observed in the Amhara region. These findings indicate the need to revise plans and policies to improve the knowledge, attitudes, and prevention practices of people towards COVID-19 in Ethiopia, especially in the Amhara region.","Azene, Abebaw Gedef; Workie, Mekuanint Simeneh; Aragaw, Abiba Mihret",Curr Ther Res Clin Exp,,515
315891,Early Appearance of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Associated Pulmonary Infiltrates During Daily Radiotherapy Imaging for Lung Cancer,2020,"Given the ubiquity of mobile applications (apps) in daily lives, understanding and reflecting end-users' human values (e.g., transparency, privacy, social recognition etc.) in apps has become increasingly important. Violations of end users' values by software applications have been reported in the media and have resulted in a wide range of difficulties for end users. Value violations may bring more and lasting problems for marginalized and vulnerable groups of end-users. This research aims to understand the extent to which the values of Bangladeshi female farmers, marginalized and vulnerable end-users, who are less studied by the software engineering community, are reflected in agriculture apps in Bangladesh. Further to this, we aim to identify possible strategies to embed their values in those apps. To this end, we conducted a mixed-methods empirical study consisting of 13 interviews with app practitioners and four focus groups with 20 Bangladeshi female farmers. The accumulated results from the interviews and focus groups identified 22 values of Bangladeshi female farmers, which the participants expect to be reflected in the agriculture apps. Among these 22 values, 15 values (e.g., accuracy, independence) are already reflected and 7 values (e.g., accessibility, pleasure) are ignored/violated in the existing agriculture apps. We also identified 14 strategies (e.g.,""applying human-centered approaches to elicit values"",""establishing a dedicated team/person for values concerns"") to address Bangladeshi female farmers' values in agriculture apps.","Shams, Rifat Ara; Shahin, Mojtaba; Oliver, Gillian; Whittle, Jon; Hussain, Waqar; Perera, Harsha; Nurwidyantoro, Arif",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05150v1.pdf,515

319291,A case of a very large haemorrhagic pericardial effusion in an adolescent patient with COVID-19 infection,2021,"Periodontitis is a complex, multifactorial chronic disease involving continuous interactions among bacteria, host immune/inflammatory responses, and modifying genetic and environmental factors. More than any other cytokine family, the interleukin (IL)-1 family includes key signaling molecules that trigger and perpetuate periodontal inflammation. Over the years, the IL-1 family expanded to include 11 members of cytokines, some with agonist activity (IL-1&#945;, IL-1ß, IL-18, IL-33, IL-36&#945;, IL-36ß, and IL-36Î³), receptor antagonists (IL-1Ra, IL-36Ra), and 2 anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-37, IL-38). The IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) has emerged as a pivotal player in the defense against periodontitis. IL-33 primarily induces the production of Th2-associated cytokines but acts as an ""alarmin"" via stimulation of mast cells. The IL-36 subclass of cytokines may be important in regulating mucosal inflammation and homeostasis. IL-37 suppresses innate and acquired immune responses. IL-38 is the most recent member of the IL-1 superfamily and has anti-inflammatory properties similar to those of IL-37 but through different receptors. However, limited evidence exists regarding the role of IL-37 and IL-38 in periodontitis. Despite the development of IL-1 blocking agents, therapeutic blockade of select IL-1 family members for periodontitis has only been partially investigated in preclinical and clinical research, while the development of IL-37 and IL-38 as novel anti-inflammatory drugs has not been considered adequately. Here, we review the key properties of the IL-1 family members and provide insights into targeting or promoting select cytokines as new therapeutic agents.","Papathanasiou, E; Conti, P; Carinci, F; Lauritano, D; Theoharides, T C",J Dent Res,,515

322062,Stress levels among an international sample of pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Background: Based on what is known at this time, pregnant women are at an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 compared to nonpregnant women. Additionally, pregnant women with COVID-19 might have an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. To investigate the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on mortality of pregnant and postpartum women, we performed a systematic review of available published literature on pregnancies affected by COVID-19. Methods: Web of Science, SCOPUS, and MEDLINE- databases were searched for original studies concerning the effect of COVID-19 on mortality of pregnant and postpartum women published by July 10, 2020. Meta-analyses of proportions were used to combine data and report pooled proportions. Results: 117 studies with a total of 11758 pregnant women were included. The age ranged between 15 and 48 years. Most subjects were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the third trimester. Disease severity was not reported in 1125 subjects. Maternal mortality was 1.3%. In 100% of fatal cases with adequate data, fever alone or with cough was one of the presenting symptoms. Also, dyspnea (58.3%) and myalgia (50%) were the most common symptoms. Sore throat (8.3%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea) (8.3%) were rare. The rate of comorbidities was 20% among COVID-19 deaths. The majority of COVID-19-infected women who died had cesarean section (58.3%), 25% had a vaginal delivery, and 16.7% of patients were not full term. Conclusion: COVID-19 infection in pregnant women was associated with higher rates (and pooled proportions) of cesarean section and mortality. Because new data are continuously being generated and published, the findings of this study can be complete and updated with new researches. The results of this study can guide and improve prenatal counseling of COVID-19-infected pregnant women.","Karimi, Leila; Makvandi, Somayeh; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Sathyapalan, Thozhukat; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",J Pregnancy,,515

In this 3-month follow-up study, we examined discharged patients who had received hUC-MSC therapy to assess the safety of this therapy and the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of these patients. The follow-up cohort consisted of 28 discharged severe COVID-19 patients who received either the standard treatment (the control group) or the standard treatment plus hUC-MSC therapy. We examined liver function, kidney function, pulmonary function, coagulation, tumor markers, and vision. We also conducted electrocardiography (ECG) analysis, let the patients answer the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and performed computed tomography (CT) imaging for assessing the lung changes. No obvious adverse effects were observed in the hUC-MSC group after 3 months. Measurements of blood routine index, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, liver and kidney function, coagulation, ECG, tumor markers, and vision were almost within the normal ranges in both the treatment and control groups. Forced expiratory volumes in 1 s (FEV1) (% of predicted) were 71.88% ± 8.46% and 59.45% ± 27.45% in the hUC-MSC and control groups (P < 0.01), respectively, and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratios were 79.95% ± 8.00% and 58.97% ± 19.16% in the hUC-MSC and control groups, respectively (P < 0.05). SGRQ scores were lower in the hUC-MSC group than in the control group (15.25 ± 3.69 vs. 31.9 ± 8.78, P < 0.05). The rate of wheezing in the hUC-MSC group was also significantly lower than that in the control group (37.5% vs. 75%, P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in CT scores between the two groups (0.60 ± 0.88 vs. 1.00 ± 1.31, P = 0.917).

The current study examined the acute mental health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in 5070 adult participants in Australia, using an online survey administered during the peak of the outbreak in Australia (27th March to 7th April 2020). Self-report questionnaires examined COVID-19 fears and behavioural responses to COVID-19, as well as the severity of psychological distress (depression, anxiety and stress), health anxiety, contamination fears, alcohol use, and physical activity. 78% of respondents reported that their mental health had worsened since the outbreak, one quarter (25.9%) were very or extremely worried about contracting COVID-19, and half (52.7%) were worried about family and friends contracting COVID-19. Uncertainty, loneliness and financial worries (50%) were common. Rates of elevated psychological distress were higher than expected, with 62%, 50%, and 64% of respondents reporting elevated depression, anxiety and stress levels respectively, and one in four reporting elevated health anxiety in the past week. Participants with self-reported history of a mental health diagnosis had significantly higher distress, health anxiety, and COVID-19 fears than those without a prior mental health diagnosis. Demographic (e.g., non-binary or different gender identity; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status), occupational (e.g., being a carer or stay at home parent), and psychological (e.g., perceived risk of contracting COVID-19) factors were associated with distress. Results revealed that precautionary behaviours (e.g., washing hands, using hand sanitiser, avoiding social events) were common, although in contrast to previous research, higher engagement in hygiene behaviours was associated with higher stress and anxiety levels. These results highlight the serious acute impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of respondents, and the need for proactive, accessible digital mental health services to address these mental health needs, particularly for those most vulnerable, including people with prior history of mental health problems. Longitudinal research is needed to explore long-term predictors of poor mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Newby, Jill M; O039,; Moore, Kathleen; Tang, Samantha; Christensen, Helen; Faasse, Kate",PLoS One,,515

In about 10% of infected cats, a potentially lethal disease, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) occurs. Virus transmission is faecal-oral. Mutian® Xraphconn (Mutian X) is a product marketed to treat cats with FIP but is also being used to stop virus shedding, although no clear guidelines exist for its use for this purpose. The aim of this study was to establish the minimum dose and treatment duration required to ensure viral clearance from the faeces of asymptomatic virus-shedding cats. In five multicat households, 29 cats naturally infected with FCoV and actively shedding virus in the faeces were given Mutian X pills. Virus shedding was monitored using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) controlled for faecal inhibitors to ensure sensitivity. Mutian X given orally cleared the virus in 29 cats; although four cats required a repeated course to finally stop virus shedding. A dose of 4 mg/kg q24 h for four days was found to be the optimal treatment protocol: 2 mg/kg cleared only 80% of cats. Post-treatment using a sensitive RT-qPCR test was essential to ensure that virus clearance had been achieved, since failure to clear even one cat can result in re-infection of the others. Records of virus shedding by cats before treatment provided a retrospective control: significantly more cats stopped shedding virus after Mutian X than recovered from infection during the control period (p < .00001). This is the first report of the successful elimination of faecal FCoV shedding in chronically infected cats.","Addie, Diane D; Curran, Sheryl; Bellini, Flora; Crowe, Ben; Sheehan, Emily; Ukrainchuk, Lesya; Decaro, Nicola",Res Vet Sci,,515

Research concerning the role of children in the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and investigating the clinical effects of infection in children, has been vital. This paper describes the publication trend for pertinent scientific literature relating to COVID-19 in children during the first 6 months of the pandemic. METHODS: A comprehensive search of preprint and published literature was conducted daily across four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Ovid-Embase and MedRXiv) between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2020. Titles and abstracts were screened against predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. FINDINGS: Over the study period, a total of 45 453 papers were retrieved, of which 476 met our inclusion criteria. The cumulative number of children described in included publications totalled (at most) 41 396. The median number of children per paper was 6 (IQR 1-33). Nearly one-third of papers (30.2%) reported on a single child, and a further 28.3% reported on between 1 and 9 children. Half of all the publications originated from Asia. INTERPRETATION: Our prospective bibliographic analysis of paediatric COVID-19 publications demonstrated a steady increase in the number of papers over time. Understanding and policy evolved with new information that was gathered over the course of the study period. However, over half of publications were individual case reports or small case series, which may have had a limited contribution to advancement of knowledge. During a pandemic, literature should be interpreted with great caution, and clinical/policy decisions should be continually reviewed in light of emerging evidence.","Stilwell, Philippa Anna; Munro, Alasdair P S; Basatemur, Emre; Talawila Da Camara, Nishanthi; Harwood, Rachel; Roland, Damian",Arch. dis. child,,515

The most common features are purported to be fever and a new persistent cough, although the global prevalence of these symptoms remains unclear. The aim of this systematic review is to determine the prevalence of symptoms associated with COVID-19 worldwide. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, medRxiv and bioRxiv on 5th April 2020 for studies of adults (>16 years) with laboratory test confirmed COVID-19. No language or publication status restrictions were applied. Data were independently extracted by two review authors into standardised forms. All datapoints were independently checked by three other review authors. A random-effects model for pooling of binomial data was applied to estimate the prevalence of symptoms, subgrouping estimates by country. I2 was used to assess inter-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: Of 851 unique citations, 148 articles were included which comprised 24,410 adults with confirmed COVID-19 from 9 countries. The most prevalent symptoms were fever (78% [95% CI 75%-81%]; 138 studies, 21,701 patients; I2 94%), a cough (57% [95% CI 54%-60%]; 138 studies, 21,682 patients; I2 94%) and fatigue (31% [95% CI 27%-35%]; 78 studies, 13,385 patients; I2 95%). Overall, 19% of hospitalised patients required non-invasive ventilation (44 studies, 6,513 patients), 17% required intensive care (33 studies, 7504 patients), 9% required invasive ventilation (45 studies, 6933 patients) and 2% required extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (12 studies, 1,486 patients). The mortality rate was 7% (73 studies, 10,402 patients). CONCLUSIONS: We confirm that fever and cough are the most prevalent symptoms of adults infected by SARS-CoV-2. However, there is a large proportion of infected adults which symptoms-alone do not identify.","Grant, Michael C; Geoghegan, Luke; Arbyn, Marc; Mohammed, Zakaria; McGuinness, Luke; Clarke, Emily L; Wade, Ryckie G",PLoS One,,515

Recent studies have reported interactions between statin treatment and COVID-19-related outcomes. The study reported here specifically assessed the association between routine statin use and COVID-19-related outcomes in inpatients with T2DM. METHODS: The Coronavirus-SARS-CoV-2 and Diabetes Outcomes (CORONADO) study was a nationwide observational study aiming to describe the phenotypic characteristics and prognosis of T2DM patients with COVID-19 admitted to 68 French hospitals between 10 March and 10 April 2020. The composite primary outcome comprised tracheal intubation and/or death within 7 and 28 days of admission. The association between statin use and outcomes was estimated by logistic regression analysis after applying inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using a propensity score-weighting approach. RESULTS: Of the 2449 patients with T2DM (881 women, 1568 men; aged 70.9 ± 12.5 years) suitable for analysis, 1192 (49%) were using statin treatment before admission. In unadjusted analyses, patients using statins had rates of the primary outcome similar to those of non-users within both 7 (29.8% vs 27.0%, respectively; P = 0.1338) and 28 days (36.2% vs 33.8%, respectively; P = 0.2191) of admission. However, mortality rates were significantly higher in statin users within 7 (12.8% vs 9.8%, respectively; P = 0.02) and 28 days (23.9% vs 18.2%, respectively; P < 0.001). After applying IPTW, significant associations were observed with statin use and the primary outcome within 7 days (OR [95% CI]: 1.38 [1.04-1.83]) and with death within both 7 (OR [95% CI]: 1.74 [1.13-2.65]) and 28 days (OR [95% CI]: 1.46 [1.08-1.95]).

It is important to determine how asymptomatic/mild patients react to SARS-CoV-2 infection and suppress virus spread. Innate immunity is important for evasion from the first virus attack, and it may play an important role in the pathogenesis in these patients. We measured serum cytokine levels of 95 COVID-19 patients during the infection's acute phase and are first to report that significantly higher IL-12 and IL-2 levels were induced in asymptomatic/mild patients versus those in the moderate/severe patients, indicating these cytokines' key roles in asymptomatic/mild infections' pathogenesis.","Tjan, Lidya Handayani; Furukawa, Koichi; Nagano, Tatsuya; Kiriu, Tatsunori; Nishimura, Mitsuhiro; Arii, Jun; Hino, Yasuhisa; Iwata, Sachiyo; Nishimura, Yoshihiro; Mori, Yasuko",J. infect. dis,,515

An online snowball sampling approach was used to collect data from netizens in four Egyptian governorates between 16 and 30 April 2020. A semi-structured questionnaire was designed to assess sociodemographic characteristics, sleeping hours per day, and psychological disturbances (depression, anxiety, and stress) of participants using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. Out of 1629 participants, 48.1% were aged &#8804; 30 years, 42.4% were men, and 20.0% were working in the health sector. The participants reported a high prevalence of depression (67.1%: mild to moderate 44.6% and severe to very severe 22.5%), anxiety (53.5%: mild to moderate 30.6% and severe to very severe 22.9%), stress (48.8%: mild to moderate 33.8% and severe to very severe 15.0%), and inadequate sleeping (< 6 h/day) 23.1%. Female sex, working in sectors other than the health sector, watching/reading COVID-19 news &#8805; 2 h/day, and lack of emotional support from family and society were associated with a high prevalence of severe to very severe depression, anxiety, and stress. In conclusion, the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on the public in Egypt were enormous, therefore, providing psychological support and counsel is warranted.","Arafa, Ahmed; Mohamed, Amel; Saleh, Lamiaa; Senosy, Shaimaa",Community ment. health j,,515

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted at the Pediatric Endocrinology Department of a third-level University Hospital in Rome, including children and adolescents with overweight and obesity. Personal, anthropometrics data and other information about physical activity, eating habits and psychological aspects were collected. RESULTS: We included in our study 64 participants, of which 33 (51.6%) were patients with overweight and 31 (48.4%) with obesity. We divided patients in two groups: patients with pre-versus post-lockdown &#916;-BMI > 0 (31, 48.4%) and patients with &#916;-BMI < 0 (33, 51.6%). Our data showed that patients whose BMI increased were more sedentary (p=0.024 for physical activity and p=0.005 for hours spent with videogames) during the pandemic. As for the eating habits more than half of the subjects (67.2%) had increased the consumption of homemade desserts, bread, pasta and pizza, and a worse diet was found in patients with BMI gain (p=0.000). Regarding the psychic condition the 80% of patients reported psychological discomfort, and patients with an increase in BMI had episodes of emotional feeding more frequently (p=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID19 pandemic has had disastrous effects not only directly, but also indirectly through the lockdown especially on some categories, such as adolescents with overweight and obesity. The results indicate that it also causes significant changes in lifestyle, physical inactivity and psychological problems among children and adolescents with obesity/overweight.","Cipolla, Clelia; Curatola, Antonietta; Ferretti, Serena; Giugno, Giulia; Condemi, Chiara; Delogu, Angelica Bibiana; Birritella, Lisa; Lazzareschi, Ilaria",Acta Biomed,,515

Respondents (224 Canadians and Americans) rated combinations of messages about compliance, systematically varied by an experimental design. Independent variables were perceived risk; the agent communicating the policy; specific social distancing practices; and methods to enforce compliance. Response patterns to each message suggest three mindset segments in each country reflecting how a person thinks. Two mindsets, the same in Canada and the US, were 'tell me exactly what to do,' and 'pandemic onlookers.' The third was 'bow to authority' in Canada, and 'tell me how' in the US. Each mindset showed different messages strongly driving compliance. To effectively use messaging about compliance, policy makers may assign any person or group in the population to the appropriate mindset segment by using a Personal Viewpoint Identifier that we developed.","Bellissimo, Nick; Gabay, Gillie; Gere, Attila; Kucab, Michaela; Moskowitz, Howard",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,515
336661,Simulation-guided preparations for the management of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases in the obstetric emergency theater,2020,"The spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, has attracted attention for its vaccine potential and binding capacity to host cell surface receptors. Much of this research focus has centered on the ectodomain of the spike protein. The ectodomain is anchored to a transmembrane region, followed by a cytoplasmic tail. Here we report a distant sequence similarity between the cysteine-rich cytoplasmic tail of the coronavirus spike protein and the hepcidin protein that is found in humans and other vertebrates. Hepcidin is thought to be the key regulator of iron metabolism in humans through its inhibition of the iron-exporting protein ferroportin. An implication of this preliminary observation is to suggest a potential route of investigation in the coronavirus research field making use of an already-established literature on the interplay of local and systemic iron regulation, cytokine-mediated inflammatory processes, respiratory infections and the hepcidin protein. The question of possible homology and an evolutionary connection between the viral spike protein and hepcidin is not assessed in this report, but some scenarios for its study are discussed.","Ehsani, Sepehr",Biol Direct,,515

The tests are based on simulated data, generated by means of a deterministic compartmental epidemiological model \cite{Matsinos2020a}, adapted herein to also include the possibility of the loss of immunity by the group of the recovered (or vaccinated) subjects. Assuming a simple temporal dependence of the effective reproduction number (the exact details are of no relevance as far as the conclusions of this work are concerned), time series of new cases were generated in a time domain of nearly one year for the five top-ranking countries in the cumulative number of infections by January 1, 2021. These countries are (in descending order of infections): the United States of America, India, Brazil, Russia, and the United Kingdom. The processing of each simulated time series led to the establishment of relations between the input (actual) and the reconstructed values of the effective reproduction number for each country and algorithm, separately; this work argues that all five algorithms underestimate the effective reproduction number when the latter exceeds the critical value of $1$. The five algorithms were subsequently applied to the real-life time series of new cases for the aforementioned five countries, which also span a temporal interval of nearly one year; corrected values of the effective reproduction number are obtained for these countries in 2020.","Matsinos, Evangelos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03330v1.pdf,515

O banco de dados genealógicos era composto pelo registro de 1500 animais nascidos entre 2005 e 2016, no qual avaliou-se os parâmetros populacionais através dos softwares ENDOG v.4.8 e o INBUPGF90. As características reprodutivas e de crescimento avaliadas foram: número de ovos/mês (NO30), peso do ovo (PO), circunferência do eixo longitudinal do ovo (CO), fertilidade, eclodibilidade, qualidade espermática, peso ao nascimento (PN), peso corporal e perímetro de peito (PP) e coxa (PC). A preparação da base de dados e a estatística inicial foram realizadas no software estatístico SAS. O modelo não-linear de Gompertz foi ajustado aos 1300 dados de peso/PP/PC por idade para explicar o crescimento dos animais. Foram criados 8 classes de peso para determinadas idades para análise de variância, sendo elas o peso aos 28 (P28), 56 (P56), 84 (P84), 112 (P112), 140 (P140), 168 (P168), 200 dias (P200) e acima de 300 dias (P>300). Os coeficientes de endogamia (F) calculados pelo ENDOG v.4.8 e INBUPGF90 foram 0,036% e 0,04%, respectivamente. O coeficiente de relacionamento médio (AR), taxa de endogamia (F) e tamanho efetivo com base no F foram de 0,63%, 0,02% e 463,56, respectivamente.

Online learning is a well-established pedagogical paradigm that has been researched and discussed from a number of perspectives. Educators associate a variety of opportunities and challenges with online education, and recently an unprecedented global pandemic, COVID-19, made traditional classroom teaching temporarily impossible. Emergency remote teaching (ERT) is a newly emerging sub-paradigm that possesses characteristics and challenges that differ from traditional online learning. Methodology and research methods. This study quantitatively examined undergraduate students' (n = 219) perspectives on the most important attributes that are associated with ERT. Moreover, the students' satisfaction with ERT was assessed, and the relationships between socio-demographic factors were analysed. Results and scientific novelty. A descriptive analysis revealed that most students preferred a traditional on-site classroom arrangement, while they were satisfied with the alternative ERT having fully virtual delivery. Also, the study highlighted that the students rated being knowledgeable, friendly, and patient as the most important characteristics of their lecturer in these unusual circumstances. Practical significance.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for policies that mitigate the spread, without relying on pharmaceutical interventions, that is, without the medical assurance of the recovery process. These policies typically entail lockdowns and mobility restrictions, having thus nonnegligible socio-economic consequences for the population. In this paper, we focus on the problem of finding the optimum policies that""flatten the epidemic curve""while limiting the negative consequences for the society, and formulate it as a nonlinear control problem over a finite prediction horizon. We utilize the model predictive control theory to design a strategy to effectively control the disease, balancing safety and normalcy. An explicit formalization of the control scheme is provided for the susceptible--infected--susceptible epidemic model over a network. Its performance and flexibility are demonstrated by means of numerical simulations.","Cenedese, Carlo; Zino, Lorenzo; Cucuzzella, Michele; Cao, Ming",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03727v2.pdf,515

A total of 3666 participants took part in this cross-sectional study (2838 students and 828 workers, of whom 73.0% were female). T-test, Chi-square test and the two-way ANOVA were used. Results showed that 43.3% of participants perceived a weight gain. Workers experienced a more substantial increase in body weight (0.7 kg) compared to students (0.3 kg; p = 0.013). A significant difference between preobese/obese workers (0.9 kg) and students (-0.3 kg; p < 0.001) was found. Overall, 57.0% of the sample was characterized by high levels of sedentary activities. Sedentary people noticed a higher weight gain (0.4 kg) compared to less sedentary people (0.3 kg; p = 0.048).

METHODS: All mass spectra were collected on an AB SCIEX TripleTOF 5600+ mass spectrometer in positive mode. Theoretical calculations were carried out by the density functional theory method at the B3LYP level with a hybrid basis set consisting of 6-31G(d,p) and LANL2DZ in the Gaussian 03 program. RESULTS: When the ruthenated [15 ]Paracyclophanes (Ru-[15 ]PCPs) and Ru (II)-arene dimers were dissolved in the alkyl alcohol solvents, the adducts of alkoxides with Ru (II)-arene cations were observed under positive ion mode ESI-MS, which were resulted from the coordination of alkyl alcohol molecules with Ru (II)-arene cations followed by the deprotonation of O-H bond on the coordinated alcohols. Furthermore, the number of alkoxides binding to Ru-[15 ]PCPs was regulated by the number of ruthenium atoms. Attributed to good solubility and small steric hindrance, the intensity of the adducts of methoxides with Ru (II)-arene cations was the strongest among three alkyl alcohols used in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristic adducts of alkoxides with Ru (II)-arene cations were pervasively present in positive ion mode ESI-MS of nine Ru (II)-arene complexes dissolved in the alkyl alcohol solvents. Taking into consideration of the solubility and signal responding, the methanol is the most suitable solvent for the ESI-MS experiments of Ru (II)-arene complexes among the eight solvents studied, where almost only the diagnostic adducts of methoxides with Ru (II)-arene cation are present.","Cao, Xiaoji; Dong, Danqi; He, Dandan; Lin, Xupin",Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom,,515

Due to a lack of available real-world data, we assessed its effectiveness and safety in moderately to critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in two public/specialty hospitals in Saudi Arabia. We included patients &#8805;18 years) admitted April-August 2020 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swab. Patients received either favipiravir (1800 mg or 1600 mg twice daily loading dose, followed by 800 mg or 600 mg twice daily) or supportive-care treatment. Patients were excluded if they were outside the study period, classified as having a mild form of the disease per WHO criteria, or had an incomplete patient file. Kaplan-Meier (KM) models were used to estimate median time to discharge. Discharge ratios, progression to mechanical ventilation, and mortality outcomes were estimated across the severity spectrum using Cox proportional-hazards models. As a sensitivity analysis, we performed propensity score-matching (PSM) analysis. RESULTS: Overall, median time to discharge was 10 days (95%CI = 9-10) in the favipiravir arm versus 15 days (95%CI = 14-16) in the supportive-care arm. The accelerated discharge benefit was seen across the COVID-19 spectrum of severity. The adjusted discharge ratio was 1.96 (95%CI = 1.56-2.46). Progression to mechanical ventilation was slower with favipiravir (HRadj = 0.10, 95%CI = 0.04-0.29). There was no significant effect on mortality (HRadj = 1.56, 95%CI = 0.73-3.36). There was a statistically non-significant trend toward worse outcomes in the critical category (HRadj = 2.80, 95%CI = 0.99-7.89). Age was an independent risk factor for mortality in mechanically ventilated patients. PSM analyses confirmed these findings. CONCLUSION: Favipiravir was associated with clinical benefits, including accelerated discharge rate and less progression to mechanical ventilation; however, no overall mortality benefits were seen across the severity spectrum.","Alamer, Ahmad; Alrashed, Ahmed A; Alfaifi, Mashael; Alosaimi, Bandar; AlHassar, Fatimah; Almutairi, Malak; Howaidi, Jude; Almutairi, Wedad; Mohzari, Yahya; Sulaiman, Tarek; Al-Jedai, Ahmed; Alajami, Hamdan N; Alkharji, Fatima; Alsaeed, Ali; Alali, Alaa H; Baredhwan, Abdullah A; Abraham, Ivo; Almulhim, Abdulaziz S",Curr Med Res Opin,,515
359768,Reorganizing the treatment of cardiovascular disease in response to coronavirus disease 2019; time for the polypill?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Skin laxity is one of the defining characteristics of aging and can be the result of various factors including intrinsic aging, genetics, diet, stress, lifestyle, sun exposure, weight fluctuations, and smoking. Recent reports suggest the ability of subdermal energy application to reduce skin laxity. Thermal energy can be delivered using different devices including lasers, radiofrequency (RF) monopolar and bipolar devices, and plasma/RF devices. Plasma-based energy platforms generate a plasma gas, allowing heat to be applied to the tissue. This study focused on the evaluation of thermal effect of plasma/RF compared to a monopolar RF device applied percutaneously to the subdermis and connective fibroseptal network in a porcine model. METHODS: The subdermal application of energy was conducted using a plasma/RF system and a monopolar RF system. Both low and high energy/temperature settings were evaluated in dynamic and stationary modes. Histomorphometry was used to determine the depth of thermal effect associated with each treatment setting. RESULTS: Both dermis and fibroseptal network tissue exhibited the presence of microscopically thermally treated zones. There were no significant differences in average and maximum depths of thermal effect between the different handpieces and electrosurgical systems used for all treatment settings. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in the thermal effect between plasma/RF and monopolar RF systems were observed, suggesting that plasma/RF systems can be safely used for the percutaneous application of energy in the subcutaneous space.","Ruff, Paul G",,,515

365733,Awareness and Impact of Non-pharmaceutical Interventions During Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in Renal Transplant Recipients,2020,"Kinesin Family Member 23 (KIF23), a cell cycle regulator, has a key task in cytokinesis. KIF23 over-expression in cancer has been associated with tumor growth, progression, and poor prognosis, indicating a potential to be a cancer biomarker. A mutation in KIF23 (c.2747C > G, p.P916R) was shown to cause congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, type III (CDA III). To-date, fifteen KIF23 transcripts have been annotated, but their expression is poorly investigated. We hypothesized that tissue specific expression of a particular transcript can be critical for CDA III phenotype. In this study, we quantified expression of alternative Kif23 transcripts in a mouse model with human KIF23 mutation and investigated its association with a regulator of alternative splicing, serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (Srsf3). We confirmed presence of an additional exon 8 in both human and mouse KIF23 transcripts. A transcript lacking exons 17 and 18 was ubiquitously expressed in mice while other isoforms were common in human tissues however in bone marrow of knock-in mice a transcript without exon 18 was prevalent as it was in bone marrow of a CDA III patient. We conclude that the possibility that the tissue specific expression of KIF23 alternative transcripts influence the CDA III phenotype cannot be neglected.","Vikberg, Ann-Louise; Malla, Sandhya; Golovleva, Irina",Blood Cells Mol Dis,,515

Certain groups are known to be at higher risk of contracting severe COVID-19 infection, such as men and people from Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. Identifying and managing HCWs who have been exposed to COVID-19 is of utmost importance in preventing healthcare transmission and protecting staff and vulnerable patients in healthcare settings. Recently, antibody testing to diagnose previous COVID-19 exposure among HCW has commenced in the UK. This provided an opportunity to assess exposure to COVID-19 among the various subgroups within the HCW community, based on their roles and ethnic background. We found that HCWs working in patient-facing roles were twice as likely to have been exposed to COVID-19 than their colleagues in non-patient-facing roles. Reassuringly, workers from BAME backgrounds had a similar risk of previous COVID-19 exposure to their white colleagues. More research is required to assess how frontline staff, especially those working in patient facing roles, can reduce their risk of exposure to COVID-19.","Razvi, Salman; Oliver, Rahima; Moore, Jonathan; Beeby, Andrew",Clin Med (Lond),,515
371368,Non-lesional status epilepticus in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019,2020,"The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has emphasized the vulnerability of human populations to novel viral pressures, despite the vast array of epidemiological and biomedical tools now available. Notably, modern human genomes contain evolutionary information tracing back tens of thousands of years, which may help identify the viruses that have impacted our ancestors-pointing to which viruses have future pandemic potential. Here, we apply evolutionary analyses to human genomic datasets to recover selection events involving tens of human genes that interact with coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, that likely started more than 20,000 years ago. These adaptive events were limited to the population ancestral to East Asian populations. Multiple lines of functional evidence support an ancient viral selective pressure, and East Asia is the geographical origin of several modern coronavirus epidemics. An arms race with an ancient coronavirus, or with a different virus that happened to use similar interactions as coronaviruses with human hosts, may thus have taken place in ancestral East Asian populations. By learning more about our ancient viral foes, our study highlights the promise of evolutionary information to better predict the pandemics of the future. Importantly, adaptation to ancient viral epidemics in specific human populations does not necessarily imply any difference in genetic susceptibility between different human populations, and the current evidence points toward an overwhelming impact of socioeconomic factors in the case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Souilmi, Yassine; Lauterbur, M Elise; Tobler, Ray; Huber, Christian D; Johar, Angad S; Moradi, Shayli Varasteh; Johnston, Wayne A; Krogan, Nevan J; Alexandrov, Kirill; Enard, David",Curr. biol,,515

METHODOLOGY: A retrospective cohort study among HIV-infected patients at two intermediate hospitals. A decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was significant if it was &#8805;25% and included a change to a lower eGFR stage. New-onset RI was defined as an eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m2 . RESULTS: 10 387 patients were included: 11.4% (n = 1182) experienced the decline in eGFR. Of these, 0.6% (n = 62) migrated to eGFR stages IV and V. The incidence was 4.5 (95% CI: 4.3-4.8) per 100 patient years. RI developed in 400 patients for an incidence rate of 2.4 (95% CI: 2.2-2.6) cases per 100 patient years. Risk factors with effect sizes >2.0, for decline-in-eGFR were baseline eGFR >60 (aHR = 15.6); hyperfiltration (aHR = 5.0); and pregnancy (aHR = 2.4); while for RI, they were hyperfiltration (aHR = 4.1) and pregnancy (aHR = 29). CONCLUSION: The incidence of decline-in-eGFR was higher than in other sub-SSA countries, but not RI. A high baseline eGFR had the greatest risk for the decline, and hyperfiltration for the RI.","Kalemeera, Francis; Godman, Brian; Stergachis, Andy; Rennie, Timothy",Pharmacoepidemiol. durg saf,,515

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of electronic health records. SUBJECTS: Eyes prescribed use of the ForeseeHome device across 4 retinal practices in the USA. METHODS: Usage information was collected from the online ForeseeHome portal for all eyes prescribed. For a pre-determined subset of eyes, additional clinical information was collected through chart review and analyzed for clinical utility. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures include frequency and length of use, number of eyes that used the device, established baseline and converted to nAMD, and number of alerts. RESULTS: 775 eyes of 448 patients were prescribed use of the ForeseeHome device. 649 eyes (83.7%) used the device at least once; among this population, 478 (73.7%) established baseline. Patients who established baseline were significantly younger than those who did not establish baseline (p<0.001). Among eyes that established baseline, 126 (26.4%) had an overall inadequate frequency of use (&#8805;2 tests per week), and 250 (52.3%) did not use the device as frequently as instructed by the manufacturer (&#8805;3 tests per week); 112 (24.7%) discontinued use within one year. Over a mean of 20.35 months, 106 patients had 152 alerts, indicating possible conversions to nAMD. Out of the 136 eyes that established baseline among 211 eyes prescribed the device at one clinical site, 52 alerts were recorded, 3 (6.8%) correctly identified conversion to nAMD and 47 (93.2%) represented false-positive alerts. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the prospective HOME study, utility of the ForeseeHome device in the current analysis of real-world clinical-practice application was limited. A meaningful proportion of eyes never used the device or could not establish baseline. Overall frequency of use was low and continuous usage of the device decreased over time. There is a need for improvement in home monitoring technology for eyes with iAMD at risk of conversion to nAMD.","Yu, Hannah J; Kiernan, Daniel F; Eichenbaum, David; Sheth, Veeral S; Wykoff, Charles C",,,515

RT-PCR data are traditionally analyzed by estimating the threshold cycle (CT ) at which the fluorescence signal produced by emission of a probe crosses a baseline level. Current models used to estimate the CT value are based on approximations that do not adequately account for the stochastic variations of the fluorescence signal that is detected during RT-PCR. Less common deviations become more apparent as the sample size increases, as is the case in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this work, we employ a method independent of CT value to interpret RT-PCR data. In this novel approach, we built and trained a deep learning model, qPCRdeepNet, to analyze the fluorescent readings obtained during RT-PCR. We describe how this model can be deployed as a quality assurance tool to monitor result interpretation in real time. The model's performance with the TaqPath COVID19 Combo Kit assay, widely used for SARS-CoV-2 detection, is described. This model can be applied broadly for the primary interpretation of RT-PCR assays and potentially replace the CT interpretive paradigm.","Alouani, David J; Rajapaksha, Roshani R P; Jani, Mehul; Rhoads, Daniel D; Sadri, Navid",J. clin. microbiol,,515

Face shields are an important component of PPE for front-line workers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, providing protection of the face from splashes and sprays of virus-containing fluids. Existing face shield designs and manufacturing procedures may not allow for production and distribution of face shields in sufficient volume to meet global demand, particularly in Low and Middle-Income countries. This paper presents a simple, fast, and cost-effective curved-crease origami technique for transforming flat sheets of flexible plastic material into face shields for infection control. It is further shown that the design could be produced using a variety of manufacturing methods, ranging from manual techniques to high-volume die-cutting and creasing. This demonstrates the potential for the design to be applied in a variety of contexts depending on available materials, manufacturing capabilities and labour. An easily implemented and flexible physical-digital parametric design methodology for rapidly exploring and refining variations on the design is presented, potentially allowing others to adapt the design to accommodate a wide range of ergonomic and protection requirements.","Bukauskas, A.; Koronaki, A.; Lee, TingUei Ott D.; Al-Asali, M.

Pulmonary Aspergillosis in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19: A Case Series,2020,"During a disease pandemic, there is still a requirement to perform postmortem examinations within the context of legal considerations. The management of the dead from COVID-19 should not impede the medicolegal investigation of the death where required by the authorities and legislation but additional health and safety precautions should be adopted for the necessary postmortem procedures. The authors have therefore used the craniotomy box in an innovative way to enable a safe alternative for skull and brain removal procedures on suspected or confirmed COVID-19 bodies. The craniotomy box technique was tested on a confirmed COVID-19 positive body where a full postmortem examination was performed by a team of highly trained personnel in a negative pressure Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) autopsy suite in the National Institute of Forensic Medicine (IPFN) Malaysia. This craniotomy box is a custom-made transparent plastic box with five walls but without a floor. Two circular holes were made in one wall for the placement of arms in order to perform the skull opening procedure. A swab to detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was taken from the interior surface of the craniotomy box after the procedure. The result from the test using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) proved that an additional barrier provided respiratory protection by containing the aerosols generated from the skull opening procedure. This innovation ensures procedures performed inside this craniotomy box are safe for postmortem personnel performing high risk autopsies during pandemics.","Hasmi, Ahmad Hafizam; Khoo, Lay See; Koo, Zhao Peng; Suriani, Muhammad Uzair Ahmad; Hamdan, Ain Nurfarahana; Yaro, Siti Wira Md; Arshad, Salmah; Siew, Sheue Feng; Ibrahim, Mohamad Azaini; Mahmood, Mohd Shah",,,515

Therefore, it can be seen as an interesting case study approach to tackle some challenges found in Covid-19. Utilizing smart bands by groups of different type of voluntaries, where vital signals were collected in a digital data fashion and then evaluated in public health unit. A recommendation system (RS) algorithm was also developed to understand users' behaviors, based upon their vital signals. In addition, we utilized a simulator software to highlight people movement and predictable scenarios of Covid-19 contamination. This last effort provides a visualization on how the proposal could also help in a real ordinary monitoring scenario. Initial results from this research work indicates a differentiated approach to tackle challenges in digital transformation in a public health scenario, especially in a pandemic.

A kinetic model of the adsorption process was developed, which accounted for protein unfolding and intermolecular interactions in the adsorbed phase. The latter incorporated positive cooperative interactions, resulting from preferred and multilayer adsorption on the adsorbent surface, as well as negative cooperative interactions attributed to exclusion effects due to size exclusion and repulsion. Cooperative adsorption resulted in negative or positive deviations from the Langmuir model for both single and multicomponent isotherms. The model was used to assess possible contributions of different adsorption mechanisms of proteins and their structurally different forms to the overall adsorption pattern, as well as to simulate chromatographic band profiles under different loading conditions. For proteins with unstable structure, the overall adsorption isotherm was dominated by binding of unfolded species at low surface coverage and by positive cooperative adsorption at high surface coverage. Furthermore, regardless of structural stability, exclusion effects influenced strongly adsorption equilibrium, particularly at low surface coverages. In case of chromatographic elution, i.e. under dynamic conditions, unfolding, negative cooperative adsorption, and kinetic effects governed the retention behavior and determined peak shapes, whereas the effect of positive cooperative adsorption was negligible.","Muca, Renata; Kolodziej, Michal; Piatkowski, Wojciech; Carta, Giorgio; Antos, Dorota",J Chromatogr A,,515

Cardiometabolic disorders are associated with poor clinical outcomes in persons with COVID-19. Healthcare challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic are linked to resource constraints including shortage of Personal Protective Equipment's (PPE), laboratory tests and medication. In this context, a group of clinical experts discussed the endocrine and cardiology vigilance required in times of COVID-19. Further, the group proposed certain resource husbandry recommendations to be followed during the pandemic to overcome the constraints. METHOD: The clinical experts discussed and provided their inputs virtually. The expert panel included clinical experts comprising endocrinologists, Consultant Physicians and cardiologists from India. The panel thoroughly reviewed existing literature on the subject and proposed expert opinion. RESULTS: The expert panel put forward clinical practice-based opinion for the management of cardiometabolic conditions including diabetes mellitus and hypertension. As these conditions are associated with poor clinical outcomes, the expert panel recommends that these persons be extra-cautious and take necessary precautions during the ongoing pandemic. Further, experts also provided appropriate, affordable, available and accessible solution to the resource constraint situations in times of COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The clinical expert opinion put forward in this article will serve as a reference for clinicians treating diabetes and cardiovascular disease during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Das, Ashok Kumar; Kalra, Sanjay; B, Krishnakumar; Sharma, Kamal; John, Mathew; Nair, Tiny; Shaikh, Shehla; Khandelwal, Deepak; Priya, Gagan; Dutta, Deep; Gangadhar, Prathosh; Dhingra, Atul; Tiwaskar, Mangesh; Shukla, Rishi; Das, Sambit; Baruah, Manash Pratim; Gangopadhyay, Kalyan Kumar; Ramakrishnan, Santosh; Deshmukh, Vaishali; Dasgupta, Arundhati; Kumar, GVijaya; Pandey, Neelam; Joshi, Amya; Surana, Vineet Kumar; Punyani, Hitesh; Shah, Parag; Rattan, Aditya; Chandrasekaran, Sruti; Asirwatham, Arthur",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,515

398635,A summary of coronavirus disease 2019: What we should know?,2020,"Colistin is an important antibiotic currently used to manage infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens in both humans and livestock animals. A new mobile colistin-resistance (mcr-9) gene was recently discovered; this discovery highlighted the need for rigorous monitoring of bacterial resistance against colistin. Salmonella is one of the major pathogens responsible for foodborne illnesses; however, there is minimal information regarding the presence of mcr genes in foodborne Salmonella strains. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of mcr genes among 178 Salmonella strains isolated from chicken meat in Korea. Antimicrobial susceptibility was measured using the broth microdilution method. Bioinformatics characterization of colistin-resistant strains and genetic environment of the mcr-9 gene were analyzed using next-generation sequencing. Transferability of the mcr-9 carrying colistin-resistant Salmonella strain was tested using broth-mating conjugation. Thirteen of the 178 Salmonella isolates showed colistin resistance, but only one strain, Salmonella Dessau ST14 (KUFSE-SAL043) from a traditional chicken market in Korea, carried an mcr family gene, mcr-9. This strain also carried other acquired antimicrobial resistance genes such as blaTEM-1B, qnrS1, and aac(6')-Iaa. Only the IncX1 plasmid replicon type was detected in this strain. In the strain KUFSE-SAL043, the mcr-9 gene was located between two insertion sequences, IS903B and IS26, followed by the downstream regulatory genes qseB-like and qseC-like, which were located between IS1R and &#916;IS1R. Conjugation tests revealed that the mcr-9 gene was successfully transferred to Escherichia coli J53 at a mean frequency of 2.03 × 10-7. This is the first report of a transferable mcr-9 gene in Salmonella isolated from chicken meat in Korea, highlighting the possibility of transfer of colistin resistance. Therefore, the wide use of colistin should be reconsidered, and a One Health perspective should be adopted to monitor the antimicrobial resistance of Enterobacteriaceae strains in humans, livestock, and the environment.","Cha, Min-Hyeok; Woo, Gun-Jo; Lee, Woojung; Kim, Seok-Hwan; Woo, Jung-Ha; Kim, Junyoung; Ryu, Jae-Gee; Kwak, Hyo-Sun; Chi, Young-Min",,,515

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. According to WHO(World Health Organization)'s situation report published on May 18th, 2020, COVID-19 has already affected 4,600,000 cases and 310,000 deaths globally and still increasing. The most severe problem of COVID-19 virus is that it spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, which occurs in everyday life. And also, at this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19.Because of the secure diffusion method and the absence of a vaccine, it is essential to self-diagnose or do a self-diagnosis questionnaire whenever possible. But self-diagnosing has too many questions, and ambiguous standards also take time. Therefore, in this study, using SVM(Support Vector Machine), Decision Tree and correlation analysis found two vital factors to predict the infection of the COVID-19 virus with an accuracy of 80%. Applying the result proposed in this paper, people can self-diagnose quickly to prevent COVID-19 and further prevent the spread of COVID-19. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University.

Optimizing Use of COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment among Resident Physicians at a Veterans Affairs Hospital,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To directly compare the prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction (smell and taste) in geographically distinct regions with the same questionnaires. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the self-reported symptoms among adults (older than 18 years) who underwent COVID-19 testing at an ambulatory assessment center in Canada and at a hospital in Israel between March 16, 2020, and August 19, 2020. The primary outcome was the prevalence of self-reported chemosensory dysfunction (anosmia/hypomsia and dysgeusia/ageusia). Subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate the prevalence of chemosensory deficits among the outpatients. RESULTS: We identified a total of 350 COVID-19-positive patients (138 Canadians and 212 Israelis). The overall prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction was 47.1%. There was a higher proportion of chemosensory deficits among Canadians compared to Israelis (66.7% vs 34.4%, P < .01). A subgroup analysis for outpatients (never hospitalized) still identified a higher prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction among Canadians compared to Israelis (68.2% vs 36.1%, P < 0.01). A majority of patients recovered their sense of smell after 4 weeks of symptom onset. CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence of chemosensory deficit in COVID-19 was found to be similar to previously published reports, the prevalence can vary significantly across different geographical regions. Therefore, it is important to obtain regionally specific data so that the symptom of anosmia/dysgeusia can be used as a guide for screening for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.","Lee, Daniel J; Daliyot, Daniella; Wang, Ri; Lockwood, Joel; Das, Paul; Zimlichman, Eyal; Lee, John M",Ear Nose Throat J,,515

406064,Volatility in International Stock Markets: An Empirical Study during COVID-19,2020,"Resumen El presente estudio pretende explorar el estado de Inseguridad Alimentaria (IA) en cada país perteneciente a la comunidad sudamericana. Para ello y considerando que es un problema vigente y de carácter multifactorial, se analizaron sus cuatro pilares: disponibilidad, acceso, estabilidad y utilización de alimentos. Como resultado, se observa que la mala utilización de alimentos, es la causa más propensa a causar IA en la comunidad sudamericana, no obstante, la indisponibilidad e inaccesibilidad hacia los alimentos, causa gran preocupación en ciertos estados de la subregión. El origen más probable es la baja promoción de buenos hábitos alimenticios, además de políticas erradas que impiden la correcta producción y/o motivación de los campesinos a seguir ejerciendo sus actividades en el agro. Este problema debe ser mitigado lo antes posible, ya que, aunque empieza por no tener el dinero y/o los hábitos alimenticios necesarios, termina con graves problemas de salud hacia los pobladores. Consideramos importante fortalecer políticas para erradicar la IA sudamericana, iniciando con el apoyo hacia la producción de alimentos, para finalizar con intervenciones nutricionales que permitan mejorar los hábitos alimenticios de los habitantes.","Aulestia-Guerrero, Edgar Manuel; Capa-Mora, Edwin Daniel",Ciênc.

The evidence collected on spreading mode of COVID-19 is mostly through skin contact and respiratory droplets. However, just in contact with the microbe is not enough to cause the disease. Reaching the germ to the internal body is the critical step involved in the manifestation of illness. Contact transmission for the sign of disease in an individual can occur from skin to the inner body especially when the infected part (mostly hands) reaches the mucous membrane of open cavi-ties such as mouth, nose, eyes or open wound. Therefore the use of good quality sanitizers to prevent infections such as COVID-19 is one of the critical mea-sures.Ayurveda is a rich source of vast information on therapeutic potentials of numerous herbs. Many simple to complex formulations can be prepared by using the therapeutic attributes of these herbs. Therefore in the present work, an attempt has been made to initiate the manufacturing of Ayurveda hand san-itizers based on various Ayurvedic medicated drugs mentioned in Samhitas, as developing countries such as India are facing a shortage of hand sanitizers which is a must prevent the spread of COVID-19. The shortage has resulted in an internal price hike, and thus there is a need for a homemade affordable way of sanitizing hands. Therefore by using a combination of antimicrobial, disin-fectant, anti-allergic, skin disease curing herbs along can be recommended for the preparation of Ayurveda hand sensitizers. By using similar herbs, nasal spray and aerosols for cleaning and increasing the strength of the respiratory tract can also be prepared.","Azim, Ashiya A. S.; Rajput, Dhirajsingh",Int. J. Res. Pharm.

408895,A Postmortem Portrait of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: A Large Multi-institutional Autopsy Survey Study,2021,"As a means to counter the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic, schools were closed throughout Germany between mid-March and end of April 2020. Schooling was translocated to the students' homes where students were supposed to work on learning tasks provided by their teachers. Students' self-regulation and attributes of the learning tasks may be assumed to have played important roles when adapting to this novel schooling situation. They may be predicted to have influenced students' daily self-regulation and hence the independence with which they worked on learning tasks. The present work investigated the role of students' trait self-regulation as well as task difficulty and task enjoyment for students' daily independence from their parents in learning during the homeschooling period. Data on children's trait self-regulation were obtained through a baseline questionnaire filled in by the parents of 535 children (M age â¯= 9.69, SD age â¯= 2.80). Parents additionally reported about the daily task difficulty, task enjoyment, and students' learning independence through 21 consecutive daily online questionnaires. The results showed students' trait self-regulation to be positively associated with their daily learning independence. Additionally, students' daily learning independence was shown to be negatively associated with task difficulty and positively with task enjoyment. The findings are discussed with regard to students' daily self-regulation during the homeschooling period. Finally, implications for teaching practice during the pandemic-related school closures are derived.","Blume, Friederike; Schmidt, Andrea; Kramer, Andrea C; Schmiedek, Florian; Neubauer, Andreas B",Z Erziehwiss,,515

414154,A Decision-Making Algorithm for Children With Suspected Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled inflammation is a central problem for many respiratory diseases. The development of potent, targeted anti-inflammatory therapies to reduce lung inflammation and re-establish the homeostasis in the respiratory tract is still a challenge. Previously, we developed a unique anti-inflammatory nanodrug, P12 (made of hexapeptides and gold nanoparticles), which can attenuate Toll-like receptor-mediated inflammatory responses in macrophages. However, the effect of the administration route on its therapeutic efficacy and tissue distribution remained to be defined. RESULTS: In this study, we systematically compared the effects of three different administration routes [the intratracheal (i.t.), intravenous (i.v.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.)] on the therapeutic activity, biodistribution and pulmonary cell targeting features of P12. Using the LPS-induced ALI mouse model, we found that the local administration route via i.t. instillation was superior in reducing lung inflammation than the other two routes even treated with a lower concentration of P12. Further studies on nanoparticle biodistribution showed that the i.t. administration led to more accumulation of P12 in the lungs but less in the liver and other organs; however, the i.v. and i.p. administration resulted in more nanoparticle accumulation in the liver and lymph nodes, respectively, but less in the lungs. Such a lung favorable distribution was also determined by the unique surface chemistry of P12. Furthermore, the inflammatory condition in the lung could decrease the accumulation of nanoparticles in the lung and liver, while increasing their distribution in the spleen and heart. Interestingly, the i.t. administration route helped the nanoparticles specifically target the lung macrophages, whereas the other two administration routes did not. CONCLUSION: The i.t. administration is better for treating ALI using nanodevices as it enhances the bioavailability and efficacy of the nanodrugs in the target cells of the lung and reduces the potential systematic side effects.","Wang, Lu; Rao, Yafei; Liu, Xiali; Sun, Liya; Gong, Jiameng; Zhang, Huasheng; Shen, Lei; Bao, Aihua; Yang, Hong",J Nanobiotechnology,,515

415223,High-titer convalescent plasma therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 and mortality,2021,"The objective of this review is to give an overview of the pathophysiological effects of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in relation to hypertension (HT), with a focus on the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) and the MAS receptor. HT is a multifactorial disease and a public health burden, as it is a risk factor for diseases like stroke, coronary artery disease, and heart failure, leading to 10.4 million deaths yearly. Blood pressure is regulated by the RAAS. The system consists of two counter-regulatory axes: ACE/ANG-II/AT1 R and ACE2/ANG-(1-7)/MAS. The main regulatory protein in balancing the RAAS is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The protein also functions as the main mediator of endocytosis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into the host cell. SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of COVID-19 and has caused a worldwide pandemic; however, the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 are limited. Several drugs and vaccines are currently being tested in clinical trials with a few already approved by EMA and FDA. HT is a major risk factor regarding the severity and fatality of COVID-19, and the RAAS plays an important role in COVID-19 infection since SARS-CoV-2 can lead to a dysregulation of the system by reducing the ACE2 expression. The exact mechanisms of HT in relation to COVID-19 remain uncertain, and more research is needed for further elucidation.","Ravichandran, Briyanth; Grimm, Daniela; Krüger, Marcus; Kopp, Sascha; Infanger, Manfred; Wehland, Markus",Physiol Rep,,515

416464,Atypical Presentation of the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Lessons Learned,2020,"BACKGROUND: Until recently, telehealth represented a small fraction of orthopedic surgery patient interactions. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a swift adoption of telehealth to avoid patient and provider exposure. This study analyzed patient and surgeon satisfaction with telehealth within the department of orthopedic surgery during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: All orthopedic surgery patients who partici-pated in telehealth from March 30 to April 30, 2020, were sent a 14-question survey via e-mail. Orthopedic surgeons who used telehealth were sent a separate 14-question survey at the end of the study period. Factors influencing patient satisfaction were determined using univariate proportional odds and multivariate partial proportional odds models. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-two patients and 33 surgeons completed the surveys. On average, patients were ""satisfied"" with telehealth (4.25/5.00 ± 0.96), and 37.0% preferred future visits to be conducted using telehealth. Multivariate partial proportional odds modeling determined that patients who found it easiest to arrange the telehealth visit had greater satisfaction (5.00/5.00 vs. 1.00-3.00/5.00: OR = 3.058; 95% CI = 1.621 to 5.768, p < 0.001), as did patients who believed they were able to communicate most effectively (5.00/5.00 vs. 1.00-4.00/5.00: OR = 20.268; 95% CI = 5.033 to 81.631, p < 0.001). Surgeons were similarly ""satisfied"" with telehealth (3.94/5.00 ± 0.86), and while their physical examinations were only ""moderately effec-tive"" (2.64/5.00 ± 0.99), they were ""fairly confident"" in their diagnoses (4.03/5.00 ± 0.64). Lastly, 36.7% ± 24.7% of surgeons believed that their telehealth patients required an in-person visit, and 93.9% of surgeons will continue using telehealth in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth emerged as a valuable tool for the delivery of health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. While both patients and surgeons were satisfied with its use, this study identifies areas that can improve the patient and surgeon experience. The effectiveness and satisfaction with telehealth should inform regulatory and reimbursement policy.","Buchalter, Daniel B.; Moses, Michael J.; Azad, Ali; Kirby, David J.; Huang, Shengnan; Bosco, Joseph A.; Yang, S.

Current single-use face shields do not provide anesthesia staff from adequate protection from bioaerosolized particles expired during a patient's cough, particularly during transfer from the operating room to the post-anesthesia recovery unit. In this study, we compare the efficacy of single-use face shield currently available at our institution to a newly designed face shield that provides better protection while still maintaining cost-effectiveness and the ease-of-use of a disposable device. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A patient actor, simulated movements from a patient post-procedure, during transport from operating room to postoperative recovery area. Patterns of exposure of bioaerosolized particles produced from a cough between different face shields was evaluated using fluorescein dye. MAIN RESULTS: More extensive coverage of the lower face, as provided by the Enhanced Protection Face Shield, offers improved droplet protection from bioaerosolized particles emitted from a cough. CONCLUSIONS: Transfer from the operating room to the post-operative recovery unit is a hands-on process and involves managing multiple aspects of patient care physically. Current single-use face shields are convenient and cost-effective, but do not provide adequate protection from droplet aerosolization by patients during transfer. Other masks that provide adequate coverage are costly and are not designed to be single-use. A single-use disposable face shield that offers improved coverage of the lower face provides improved protection for anesthesia staff while maintaining cost-effectiveness, ease-of-use, and infection control.","Ko-Keeney, Ellen H; Saran, Manick S; McLaughlin, Kelly; Lipman, Sidney",Am J Otolaryngol,,515

Access to testing in the US has been heterogeneous and symptoms vary widely in infected persons. Public health surveillance efforts and metrics are therefore hampered by underreporting. We set out to provide a minimally biased estimate of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among adults for a large and diverse county (Orange County, CA, population 3.2 million). We implemented a surveillance study that minimizes response bias by recruiting adults to answer a survey without knowledge of later being offered SARS-CoV-2 test. Several methodologies were used to retrieve a population-representative sample. Participants (n = 2979) visited one of 11 drive-thru test sites from July 10th to August 16th, 2020 (or received an in-home visit) to provide a finger pin-prick sample. We applied a robust SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Microarray technology, which has superior measurement validity relative to FDA-approved tests. Participants include a broad age, gender, racial/ethnic, and income representation. Adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 11.5% (95% CI: 10.5-12.4%). Formal bias analyses produced similar results. Prevalence was elevated among Hispanics (vs. other non-Hispanic: prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.47, 95% CI 1.22-1.78) and household income < $50,000 (vs. > $100,000: PR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.79). Results from a diverse population using a highly specific and sensitive microarray indicate a SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of ~ 12 percent. This population-based seroprevalence is seven-fold greater than that using official County statistics.

423035,"Clinical characteristics of 78 cases of patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan, China",2020,"BACKGROUND: SRL172 prevented disease due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a Phase 3 trial. DAR-901 represents a scalable manufacturing process for SRL172. We sought to determine if DAR-901 would prevent infection with M. tuberculosis among BCG-primed adolescents age 13-15 years in Tanzania. METHODS: Adolescents with a negative T- SPOT.TBR interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) were randomized 1:1 to three intradermal injections of DAR-901 or saline placebo at 0, 2 and 4 months. Repeat IGRAs were performed at 2 months, and at 1, 2, and 3 years. The primary efficacy outcome was time to new TB infection (IGRA conversion to positive); the secondary outcome was time to persistent TB infection (IGRA conversion with repeat positive IGRA). RESULTS: Among 936 participants screened 667 were eligible and randomized to their first dose of vaccine or placebo (safety cohort). At 2 months, 625 participants remained IGRA-negative and were scheduled for the additional two doses (efficacy cohort). DAR-901 was safe and well-tolerated. One DAR-901 recipient developed a vaccine site abscess. Neither the primary nor secondary endpoints differed between the two treatment arms (p = 0.90 and p = 0.20, respectively). DAR-901 IGRA converters had median responses to ESAT-6 of 50.1 spot-forming cells (SFCs) vs. 19.6 SFCs in placebo IGRA converters (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: A three-dose series of 1 mg DAR-901 was safe and well-tolerated but did not prevent initial or persistent IGRA conversion.

However, it has also created challenges in preparing future nurses as much of nursing instruction, including clinical experiences, needed to urgently transition learning to a virtual environment. This paper describes the process faculty experienced during spring 2020 to quickly transition public health nursing clinicals from in-person to virtual learning in response to COVID-19. Further, faculty lessons learned are shared and include the importance of creating a supportive team dynamic, embracing innovation, continuing to engage with community partners, and adapting to meet emerging student needs during the evolving pandemic. The process and lessons learned may act as a guide for other nursing programs as we continue to navigate nursing education during this and future pandemics.","Bejster, Mallory; Cygan, Heide; Morris Burnett, Glenda; Smith, Diane Y; Brown Walker, Mary; Friese, Tanya",Public health nurs,,515
425426,Prevention and control of coronavirus disease 2019 in Grade-III Class-A hospitals outside of Wuhan,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of a recent pandemic that has led to more than 3 million deaths worldwide. Most individuals are asymptomatic or display mild symptoms, which raises an inherent question as to how does the immune response differs from patients manifesting severe disease? During the initial phase of infection, dysregulated effector immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, megakaryocytes, basophils, eosinophils, erythroid progenitor cells, and Th17 cells can alter the trajectory of an infected patient to severe disease. On the other hand, properly functioning CD4+, CD8+ cells, NK cells, and DCs reduce the disease severity. Detailed understanding of the immune response of convalescent individuals transitioning from the effector phase to the immunogenic memory phase can provide vital clues to understanding essential variables to assess vaccine-induced protection. Although neutralizing antibodies can wane over time, long-lasting B and T memory cells can persist in recovered individuals. The natural immunological memory captures the diverse repertoire of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes after natural infection whereas, currently approved vaccines are based on a single epitope, spike protein. It is essential to understand the nature of the immune response to natural infection to better identify 'correlates of protection' against this disease. This article discusses recent findings regarding immune response against natural infection to SARS-CoV-2 and the nature of immunogenic memory. More precise knowledge of the acute phase of immune response and its transition to immunological memory will contribute to the future design of vaccines and the identification of variables essential to maintain immune protection across diverse populations.","Ahluwalia, Pankaj; Vaibhav, Kumar; Ahluwalia, Meenakshi; Mondal, Ashis K; Sahajpal, Nikhil; Rojiani, Amyn M; Kolhe, Ravindra",Front Immunol,,515

The World Health Organization (WHO) called COVID-19 is a new virus of the coronavirus family. On March 12, the WHO declared this outbreak as a pandemic as it spread worldwide. Human epidemics usually follow the start of exponential growth, this means that from a small number of cases in a few days, a large increase in the number of infected people is observed. The clinical manifestations and spectrum of symptomatic disease range from moderate to critical presentations. In cases with fatal progression, the most serious complications sometimes are cause of a multi-organ failure and patient death. SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmission rate, the route of transmission between humans is through the secretions of infected people, hands or contaminated objects. In general, the epidemic control measures used so far have been based on adoption of interventions from the classical epidemiology, identifying and isolating the cases, following the contacts and establishing restrictions, including quarantine, closure of educational centers, avoiding events in which crowds of people occur, limiting mobility. These measures have been effective in China, the original focus of the outbreak.","Garcia-Alamino, Josep Mª",Enferm. clin. (Ed. impr.),,515
427248,Clinical characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 in newborns: a systematic review,2020,"BACKGROUND: Studies of previous pandemics indicate that healthcare workers have a high risk of developing symptoms related to mental health, especially depression, anxiety, and stress. OBJECTIVE: To identify mental disorder symptoms among Brazilian healthcare workers during the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic and compare findings in different work categories. METHODS: This was an online cross-sectional study. Information related to the pandemic and mental disorder symptoms was collected. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale and the Impact of Event Scale-revised were used. Associations were estimated by the chi-square test. The mean scores were compared among work categories with ANOVA (&#945; = 5%) and the prevalence of symptoms was estimated. RESULTS: 1,609 healthcare workers participated in the survey [mean age: 36.9 (SD = 11.6) years, women = 83.6%]. There was no association between work category and changes in mental health during the pandemic (p = 0.288) or prevalence of unsafe feeling (p = 0.218). A significant relationship was observed between maintaining work activities during the pandemic and work category (p < 0.001). Physicians had the lowest out-of-work prevalence (9.5%) while dentists had the highest (32.3%). Physicians and nurses showed the highest prevalence of in-person work routine. Psychologists presented the highest prevalence of remote work (64.0%) while dentists had the lowest (20.2%). A high prevalence of depression (D), anxiety (A), and stress (S) symptoms was observed in all professional categories (D: 57.2, 95% CI 48.3-66.1%; A: 46.20%, 95% CI = 37.2-55.2%; S: 55.80%, 95% CI = 46.8-64.8%), with physicians (D = 38.4%, A = 25.80%, S = 37.90%), psychologists (D = 50.2%, A = 39.0%, S = 43.1%), and nurses (D = 50.0%, A = 40.9%, S = 49.0%) having significantly lower scores. Psychologists had the lowest pandemic-related psychological impact (42.70%, 95% CI 36.8-48.6%). CONCLUSION: Extreme changes in the work routine of dentists and psychologists and an overall high prevalence of mental symptoms due to the pandemic were found. Researchers should focus on gathering information that can identify workers at increased risk of mental illness to guide discussions and develop actions to minimize the harm of the pandemic. In addition, we suggest that healthcare and support systems urgently adopt mental health care measures with specialized professionals to protect the psychological well-being of the healthcare community.","Campos, Juliana Alvares Duarte Bonini; Martins, Bianca Gonzalez; Campos, Lucas Arrais; de Fátima Valadão-Dias, Filomena; Marôco, João",Int. arch. occup. environ. health,,515
428208,Challenges for the Pediatricians During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic Start From the Neonatal Period,2020,"This study explored the technology learning model of the elderly in a senior learning center under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many senior learning centers were closed during the pandemic, and many of them adopted the mode of online education. However, problems such as decreased motivation and a lack of peer interaction still exist. To solve these problems, this study used the easy-to-implement calligraphy AR approach and E-book approach to conduct a quasi-experiment on the elderly of a calligraphy course offered by a senior learning center. The results show a higher learning motivation among the elderly who use calligraphy AR. The learning effectiveness and technology acceptance of the elderly in the E-book learning group were higher than those in the calligraphy AR group. The elderly mentioned that the E-book learning approach is more user-friendly. In general, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the suspension of classes in senior centers, education through the development of technology has stimulated the growth of education in advanced learning centers. Through this kind of scientific and technological learning method, it will bring a whole new experience to the elderly. It can improve the stress relief methods, mental health, and quality of life of the elderly during the COVID-19 emergency shutdown, and provide a novel calligraphy technique learning experience for the elderly. Therefore, we believe that the calligraphy AR learning approach and the calligraphy E-book learning approach are practical and may promote quality of life and mental health of the elderly during the emergency closures due to COVID-19, providing elderly attendees with a novel calligraphy technology learning experience.","Lee, Chia-Jung; Hsu, Yen",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,515

AIM: We investigated whether patients and their families were consistent in recognizing the occurrence and severity of symptomatic side effects of chemotherapy treatment for cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a prospective observational study. We administered a questionnaire survey to patients and family members to assess the frequency of occurrence (1: never, 2: almost never, 3: sometimes, 4: frequently, 5: almost always, 6: unknown) and the degree of severity (1: mild, 2: moderate, 3: severe, 4: extremely severe, 5: unknown) of physical and psychological symptoms associated with cancer chemotherapy. Weighted Kappa and Cramer coefficients were used to assess consistency between the two groups. We surveyed 20 pairs of patients (5 men, 15 women) and their families (10 men, 10 women); 17 pairs lived together. The median age was 65.5 years (interquartile [IQR], 58.75, 69.25) for patients and 61.00 years (IQR, 47.25, 71.25) for family members. Of patients, 17 had solid cancer, and three had leukemia. Family members mostly recognized objectively visible symptoms such as hair loss and development of spots and keratinization. However, it was difficult for families to detect invisible subjective symptoms such as weakness, dysesthesia, depressed mood, and unarticulated anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that recognition of invisible subjective symptoms in patients undergoing chemotherapy was difficult even for family members. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach in which various medical professionals actively communicate with both patients and families is important. Information sharing in collaboration with patients and families could increase understanding of the patient's condition and optimize patient care.","Horio, Fukuko; Ikeda, Tokunori; Arake, Yurimi; Kawashima, Nodoka; Eto, Erina; Matsukura, Makoto; Fujii, Isao; Uchida, Yuji",Cancer Rep (Hoboken),,515

We aimed to compare quality of AMI care in England and Wales during and before the COVID-19 pandemic using the 2020 European Society of Cardiology Association for Acute Cardiovascular Care quality indicators (QIs) for AMI. METHODS: Cohort study of linked data from the AMI and the percutaneous coronary intervention registries in England and Wales between 1 January 2017 and 27 May 2020 (representing 236 743 patients from 186 hospitals). At the patient level, the likelihood of attainment for each QI compared with pre COVID-19 was calculated using logistic regression. The date of the first national lockdown in England and Wales (23 March 2020) was chosen for time series comparisons. RESULTS: There were 10 749 admissions with AMI after 23 March 2020. Compared with before the lockdown, patients admitted with AMI during the first wave had similar age (mean 68.0 vs 69.0 years), with no major differences in baseline characteristics (history of diabetes (25% vs 26%), renal failure (6.4% vs 6.9%), heart failure (5.8% vs 6.4%) and previous myocardial infarction (22.9% vs 23.7%)), and less frequently had high Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk scores (43.6% vs 48.6%). There was an improvement in attainment for 10 (62.5%) of the 16 measured QIs including a composite QI (43.8% to 45.2%, OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.10) during, compared with before, the lockdown. CONCLUSION: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in England and Wales, quality of care for AMI as measured against international standards did not worsen, but improved modestly.","Aktaa, Suleman; Yadegarfar, Mohammad E; Wu, Jianhua; Rashid, Muhammad; de Belder, Mark; Deanfield, John; Schiele, Francois; Minchin, Mark; Mamas, Mamas; Gale, Chris P",BMJ qual. saf.

438117,From Prediction to Prescription: Evolutionary Optimization of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions in the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Widespread transmission of a novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has caused major public health and economic problems around the world. Significant mitigation efforts have been implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19 but the role of ambient noise and elevated vocal effort on airborne transmission have not been widely reported. Elevated vocal effort has been shown to increase emission of potentially infectious respiratory droplets, which can remain airborne for up to several hours. Multiple confirmed clusters of COVID-19 transmission were associated with settings where elevated vocal effort is generally required for communication, often due to high ambient noise levels, including crowded bars and restaurants, meat packing facilities, and long-stay nursing homes. Clusters of COVID-19 transmission have been frequently reported in each of these settings. Therefore, analysis of COVID-19 transmission clusters in different settings should consider whether higher ambient noise levels, which are associated with increased vocal effort, may be a contributing factor in those settings. Mitigation strategies that include reduction of ambient noise, softer speech practices, and the use of technology such as microphones and speakers to decrease vocal effort will likely reduce the risk of transmitting COVID-19 or other airborne pathogens.","Kopechek, Jonathan A",J Acoust Soc Am,,515

Focusing on HCW behavior related to respirator use is an effective route to improve HCW safety and respiratory health. METHODS: Participants were asked to perform the donning and doffing of an N95 respirator to camera. Then they were randomized to a video alone or a reflective practice intervention. After the intervention they repeated the donning and doffing to camera. A critical safety behavior scoring tool (CSBST) was developed to compare the performance of the participants over time at pretest, post-test and 1 month later for follow-up. RESULTS: The reflective practice intervention group was found to have significantly higher scores on the CSBST at post-test and follow-up than the video alone group. In the reflective practice intervention group, the participants perceived they were better at performing the N95 donning and doffing than the experts scored them. CONCLUSIONS: The CSBST is a tool to measure the performance of HCWs on a specific targeted safety behaviors.

We consider that this surgery can be managed with intra-articular local anesthesia, thus avoiding prolonged stays in recovery, with effective pain management and optimization of presurgical, intrasurgical and post-surgical times. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective, quasi-experimental, longitudinal study to compare two anesthetic procedures: intraarticular anesthesia (lidocaine with epinephrine, bupivacaine and fentanyl) without the use of ischemia (group A); spinal blockage and use of ischemia (group B) by assessing age, surgery time, pain during surgery and 24 hour post-op VA scale, time spent in recovery, need to administer general anesthesia or anesthetic rescue doses, 24-hour range of motion. Student t-test, significance level was used: p 0.05 for nonparametric variables and 2 parametric variables. RESULTS: 38 patients were included per group. The surgical time (45 min vs 39 min, p = 0.03), recovery time (1.9 vs 3 hours, p = 0.0004) were lower in group A, while pain during surgery was greater (17 vs 3%, p = 0.09), without requiring general anesthesia.

446348,Kinase inhibitors developed for treatment of hematologic malignancies: implications for immune modulation in COVID-19,2021,"Recent epidemiologic, virologic, and modeling reports support the possibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission from persons who are presymptomatic (SARS-CoV-2 detected before symptom onset) or asymptomatic (SARS-CoV-2 detected but symptoms never develop). SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the absence of symptoms reinforces the value of measures that prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by infected persons who may not exhibit illness despite being infectious. Critical knowledge gaps include the relative incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, the public health interventions that prevent asymptomatic transmission, and the question of whether asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection confers protective immunity.","Furukawa, Nathan W; Brooks, John T; Sobel, Jeremy",Emerg. infect. dis,,515
446548,Drug desensitization in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic era Local success to widespread potential,2021,"BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a serious health threat in the Amazonas Region of Peru and approximately 95% of the cases, mainly Plasmodium vivax, are found in native communities of The Rio Santiago District, Condorcanqui Province. In 2019, more than one thousand malaria cases were reported, with an unusual number of Plasmodium falciparum autochthonous cases. The present study aims to report this P. falciparum outbreak while describing the epidemiology of malaria and the risk factors associated in the native communities of Amazonas, Peru. METHODS: The DIRESA-Amazonas in collaboration with the Condorcanqui Health Network and the Institute of Tropical Diseases of the UNTRM carried out a malaria Active Case Detection (ACD III) between January 31st and February 10th of 2020. A total of 2718 (47.4%) individuals from 21 native communities grouped in eight sanitary districts, were screened for malaria infections. Each participant was screened for malaria using microscopy. Follow-up surveys were conducted for all malaria positive individuals to collect socio-demographic data. Spatial clustering of infection risk was calculated using a generalized linear model (GLM). Analysis of risk considered factors such as gender, age, type of infection, symptomatology, and parasitaemia. RESULTS: The study suggests that the P. falciparum index case was imported from Loreto and later spread to other communities of Rio Santiago during 2019. The ACD III reported 220 (8.1%) malaria cases, 46 P. falciparum, 168 P. vivax and 6 mixed infections. SaTScan analysis detected a cluster of high infection risk in Middle Rio Santiago and a particular high P. falciparum infection risk cluster in Upper Rio Santiago. Interestingly, the evaluation of different risk factors showed significant associations between low parasitaemia and P. falciparum asymptomatic cases. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of a P. falciparum outbreak in native communities of Condorcanqui, Amazonas. Timely identification and treatment of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases are critical to achieve malaria control and possible elimination in this area. However, the current malaria situation in Condorcanqui is uncertain, given that malaria ACD activities have been postponed due to COVID-19.","Montenegro, Carla C; Bustamante-Chauca, T Pershing; Pajuelo Reyes, Cecilia; Bernal, Miguel; Gonzales, Lizandro; Tapia-Limonchi, Rafael; Tejedo, Juan R; Chenet, Stella M",Malar J,,515

Additionally, some methods—such as thermal treatment—which seemed to be not fully aligned with the circular economy approach have advantages not taken into account before. Incineration of higher volume of waste affects the waste structure and will change some of the circular economy objectives.

We treated our first COVID-19 pregnant patient on April 4th, 2020 reaching a total of 193 pregnant women, with PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 by 8th March 2021. Several studies from Israel have evaluated pregnancy-related outcomes of COVID-19, be it maternal, obstetrical or neonatal complications. We suggest that only in a small subset of severely ill mothers, intubated and otherwise respiratory or hemodynamically unstable, an emergency cesarean delivery should be considered, factoring gestational age, in order to assist maternal ventilation and circulation, as well as to avoid possible secondary fetal compromise due the maternal deterioration.In addition, there is conflicting evidence as to the price of lockdown on obstetrical outcomes, i.e., not the direct medical impact of the virus, but rather the impact of the measures to contain its spread - mainly lockdowns, which has been a major tool in Israel to combat COVID-19.Finally, we demonstrate to overall safety and efficacy of vaccination pregnant women and the beneficial impact on pregnancy outcome and neonatal gain of protecting antibodies.Conclusion: The data emerging from Israel is overall reassuring, as for the association of COVID-19 with adverse pregnancy outcome and the possible protective effect of the vaccinations. Further, long term studies, should be conducted to answer the long-term maternal outcomes, as well and neonatal prognosis.","Hadar, Eran; Dollinger, Sarah; Wiznitzer, Arnon",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,515

However, the dynamic change of kidney function and its association with COVID-19 prognosis are largely unknown. Methods: In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, we analyzed clinical characteristics, medical history, laboratory tests, and treatment data of 12,413 COVID-19 patients. The patient cohort was stratified according to the severity of the outcome into three groups: non-severe, severe, and death. Findings: The prevalence of elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), elevated serum creatinine (Scr), and decreased blood uric acid (BUA) at admission was 6.29%, 5.22%, 11.66%, respectively. The trajectories showed elevation of BUN level and Scr level, as well as a reduction of BUA level during 28 days after admission in death cases. Increased all-cause mortality risk was associated with elevated baseline levels of BUN and Scr, and decreased level of BUA. Conclusion: The dynamic changes of the three kidney function markers were associated with different severity and poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. BUN showed close association and high potential for predicting adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients for severity stratification and triage.","Liu, Ye-Mao; Xie, Jing; Chen, Ming-Ming; Zhang, Xiao; Cheng, Xu; Li, Haomiao; Zhou, Feng; Qin, Juan-Juan; Lei, Fang; Chen, Ze; Lin, Lijin; Yang, Chengzhang; Mao, Weiming; Chen, Guohua; Lu, Haofeng; Xia, Xigang; Wang, Daihong; Liao, Xiaofeng; Yang, Jun; Huang, Xiaodong; Zhang, Bing-Hong; Yuan, Yufeng; Cai, Jingjing; Zhang, Xiao-Jing; Wang, Yibin; Zhang, Xin; She, Zhi-Gang; Li, Hongliang",,,515
449924,Valuable Insights into the Immune Responses against Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework based on randomized neural network. In particular, inspired by the principles of Random Vector Functional Link (RVFL) network, we present a deep RVFL network (dRVFL) with stacked layers. The parameters of the hidden layers of the dRVFL are randomly generated within a suitable range and kept fixed while the output weights are computed using the closed form solution as in a standard RVFL network. We also propose an ensemble deep network (edRVFL) that can be regarded as a marriage of ensemble learning with deep learning. Unlike traditional ensembling approaches that require training several models independently from scratch, edRVFL is obtained by training a single dRVFL network once. Both dRVFL and edRVFL frameworks are generic and can be used with any RVFL variant. To illustrate this, we integrate the deep learning networks with a recently proposed sparse-pretrained RVFL (SP-RVFL). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets from diverse domains show the superior performance of our proposed deep RVFL networks.","Katuwal, Rakesh; Suganthan, P.

449955,Social stigma in the time of coronavirus disease 2019,2020,"Early reports of potential treatment for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have raised concerns related to pharmaceutical distribution. Despite the lack of high-quality evidence, the mere hope of effectiveness of potential treatments, such as hydroxychloroquine, has led to surges in demand for these products, and many pharmacists are already informally reporting shortages through social channels. As manufacturers and wholesale distributors struggle to fulfill orders for drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, short-term price increases may seem reasonable in a free market when demand increases. However, any price increases by manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and pharmacies might be seen as exploitive gouging of consumers during a declared emergency. In addition to concerns of price gouging, increases in prescription drug utilization during the pandemic may lead to increases in spending for all payers as members may be treated for COVID-19. This article explores pharmaceutical supply chain and drug pricing nuances that may cause problems for payers and pharmacies as the country battles this global pandemic.

450471,"Coronavirus disease 2019, vitamin D and kidney function",2021,"During infectious disease epidemics, an important question is whether cases travelling to new locations will trigger local outbreaks. The risk of this occurring depends on the transmissibility of the pathogen, the susceptibility of the host population and, crucially, the effectiveness of surveillance in detecting cases and preventing onward spread. For many pathogens, transmission from pre-symptomatic and/or asymptomatic (together referred to as non-symptomatic) infectious hosts can occur, making effective surveillance challenging. Here, by using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study, we show how the risk of local outbreaks can be assessed when non-symptomatic transmission can occur. We construct a branching process model that includes non-symptomatic transmission and explore the effects of interventions targeting non-symptomatic or symptomatic hosts when surveillance resources are limited. We consider whether the greatest reductions in local outbreak risks are achieved by increasing surveillance and control targeting non-symptomatic or symptomatic cases, or a combination of both. We find that seeking to increase surveillance of symptomatic hosts alone is typically not the optimal strategy for reducing outbreak risks. Adopting a strategy that combines an enhancement of surveillance of symptomatic cases with efforts to find and isolate non-symptomatic infected hosts leads to the largest reduction in the probability that imported cases will initiate a local outbreak.","Lovell-Read, Francesca A; Funk, Sebastian; Obolski, Uri; Donnelly, Christl A; Thompson, Robin N",J R Soc Interface,,515

This situation has, however, dramatically changed in 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced colleges to rapidly transit from face-to-face instructions to online classes. Here, we report the development of an interactive simulator that is freely available on the web (http://neurosphere.cos.northeastern.edu/) for teaching lab classes in developmental biology. This simulator is based on cellular automata models of neural-stem-cell-driven tissue growth in the neurosphere assay. By modifying model parameters, users can explore the role in tissue growth of several developmental mechanisms, such as regulation of mitosis or apoptotic cell death by contact inhibition. Besides providing an instantaneous animation of the simulated development of neurospheres, the Neurosphere Simulator tool offers also the possibility to download data for detailed analysis. The simulator function is complemented by a tutorial that introduces students to computational modeling of developmental processes.","Zupanc, Günther K H; Lehotzky, Dávid; Tripp, Isabel P",Dev Biol,,515

451135,Development and progress of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 antiviral drugs,2020,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a significant reduction in the number of patients treated in elective medicine in hospitals in spring 2020. Up until now, there are no corresponding data for university policlinics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: With the help of the data of the clinic's electronic medical record system (IS-H/i.s.h.med from SAP, Cerner Corporation, North Kansas City, MO, United States of America and SAP SE, Walldorf, Germany) and the time recording and management software TimeElement (Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany), which was codeveloped at our clinic, all patient contacts of the COVID-19 shutdown were evaluated over a period of approximately 7 weeks from 18 March 2020 to 8 May 2020 and compared with the same period in 2019. In addition, quarterly revenues for the first and second quarters of 2019 and 2020 were put into perspective via SAP. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 period the total number of patient contacts was reduced by 59.5% compared to the previous year. The number of lockdown period cases decreased by 74.8% compared to the same period in 2019. In particular, the university outpatient/self-paying sector recorded the largest number of lost patient contacts with a reduction to 17.2% of the 2019 baseline. The reduced patient contacts and case numbers resulted in a significant financial loss of at least â¯218,000. Via TimeElement there was a 69.4% decrease in all special diagnostic services, with visual field examinations in particular also reduced by 75.3%. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements recorded a decrease of 60.3%. Patient tracking revealed a reduction of average patient attendance times by approximately 23% (COVID 19: 145.8â¯± 88.8â¯min versus 189.6â¯± 97.2â¯min in 2019). DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 shutdown caused the work performance of our policlinic to drop to only about 40% of patient contacts and that of functional diagnostic examinations to only about 30%, compared to the performance in 2019; however, the reduction in the number of patients also led to a significant reduction in the time patients were present at the clinic compared to the regular workload. The associated financial losses are considerable and obviously not compensated by legally regulated compensation payments as in the inpatient sector.","Framme, C; Gottschling, J; Buley, P; Rohwer-Mensching, K; Junker, B; Dittberner, M; Volkmann, I",Ophthalmologe,,515

We evaluated the usefulness of genetic and serological tests conducted during a COVID-19 outbreak in a nursing facility in Japan. METHODS: After the first identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a comprehensive, facility- and/or unit-wide PCR testing from nasopharyngeal swabs was repeatedly performed in a three-unit facility including 99 residents with dementia and 53 healthcare personnel. Additionally, PCR testing was conducted separately for residents and staff with fever of &#8805;37.5 °C. Facility-wide serological testing, including rapid kit testing and quantitative assay, was conducted twice over 1 month apart. RESULTS: A total of 322 PCR and 257 antibody tests were performed. 37 (24.3%) of the 152 individuals (25/99 residents, 25.3%; 12/53 staff, 22.6%) were identified as PCR-positive. Seven residents died with a mortality of 7.1% (7/99). Among the 37 individuals, 10 (27.0%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing. PCR positivity was concentrated on one unit (Unit 1) (20/30 residents, 66.7%; 9/14 staff, 64.3%). The other units showed a limited spread of infection. In unit-wide and separate tests, PCR positivity detection was highly prevalent (22.9 and 44.4%, respectively) in Unit 1, compared with that in the other units. Serological testing identified two additional infected residents with a negative PCR result and showed that no staff was newly identified as infected. CONCLUSIONS: Thorough PCR testing, in combination with comprehensive and separate tests, is critical for managing COVID-19 outbreaks in nursing facilities, particularly, in units considered an epicenter. Serological testing is also beneficial for tracing contacts, confirming the number of infected individuals, and authorizing the termination of the outbreak.","Chong, Yong; Tani, Naoki; Ikematsu, Hideyuki; Terazawa, Nobuto; Nakashima, Hitoshi; Shimono, Nobuyuki; Akashi, Koichi; Tanaka, Yosuke",BMC Infect Dis,,515

METHODS: The patients' demographic information, cancer history, treatment pattern, information about MERS-coronavirus (CoV) infection, history of travel, clinical symptoms, test results, and outcome were collected and analyzed as part of a quality improvement project to improve the care and safety of our patients. Only patients with confirmed infection were included. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients were identified, with a median age of 66 years (range, 16-88 years), and 12 patients (63%) were males. The most common underlying disease was hematologic malignancies (47.4%), followed by colorectal cancer (21%) and lung cancer (15.8%). Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most common comorbidities (57.9% and 52.6%, respectively). Infection was diagnosed by nasopharyngeal swab in all patients. All patients contracted the infection during their hospitalization for other reasons. Sixteen patients (80%) were admitted to the intensive care unit; 13 patients (81%) had acute respiratory distress syndrome, 11 were intubated (68.75%), 9 had acute renal injury (56.25%), and 3 required dialysis (18.75%). Only 3 patients (15.8%) with early-stage cancers survived. Patients with hematologic malignancies and advanced solid tumors had a 100% case fatality rate. The majority of the causes of death were due to multi-organ failure and septic shock. CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV infection resulted in a high case fatality rate in patients with malignancy. Therefore, it is critical to implement effective primary preventive measures to avoid exposure of patients with cancer to the virus.","Jazieh, Abdul-Rahman; Alenazi, Thamer H; Alhejazi, Ayman; Al Safi, Faisal; Al Olayan, Ashwaq",JCO Glob Oncol,,515

This study aims to identify the psychological perceptions of people who are ignoring the warnings of novel COVID-19 infection. A qualitative content analysis was carried out from May to July 2020. The interviewees were selected purposefully from Isfahan, Iran. The saturation point was achieved in 20 semi-structured interviews. The thematic analysis approach was used to analyze the transcribed documents using MAXQDA software (version 12).The results revealed 2 themes and 6 sub-themes related to the psychological beliefs of individuals with no attention to corona alerts. Themes and sub-themes included Biased cognitive processing (biased beliefs, attention biases, metacognitive beliefs and Depressogenic schemata), low compassion, and empathy for oneself and others (Negative Emotions towards Oneself, low altruism). To ensure a positive attitude towards precautionary measures in society, the thoughts, perceptions, and behaviors of people who ignore coronavirus alerts need to be changed. This is achieved through the use of mass media and virtual networks, by encouraging people to change their negative attitude towards the use of preventive measures, individual and social protection campaigns, and by fostering a sense of responsibility.","Nosratabadi, Mehdi; Halvaiepour, Zohreh",Integr. psychol. behav. sci,,515

In SARS-CoV-2 infected cancer patients risks associated with other underlying comorbidities might vary from those in non-cancer SARS CoV-2 infected patients. The relative impact of different underlying health conditions among patients with cancer and SARS CoV-2 infection remains yet to be explored. This systematic review aims to explore the prevalence of comorbidities among cancer patients with SARS CoV-2 infection and their impact on mortality. METHODS: Online databases PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of science were searched for articles published between 9th July 2019 to July 8th 2020.Studies of cancer patients (>18 years) with diagnosis of SARS CoV-2 infection, published in English were included. A random-effects modelling for the meta-analyses was applied to assess the pooled prevalence and odds ratio for mortality due to comorbidities in SARS CoV-2 infected cancer patients. RESULTS: Total 31studies with 4086 SARS-CoV-2 infectedcancer patientsmet the inclusion criteria. Most prevalent co-morbidities in cancer patients with SARS CoV-2 infection were hypertension [42.3% (95%CI:37.5- 47.0)], diabetes [17.8% (95% CI: 15.3-20.4)] and cardiovascular diseases [16.7% (95%CI:12.9-20.4)].The risk of mortality (pOR) was significantly higher in individuals with hypertension[1.6(95%CI 1.24-2.00)], cardiovascular diseases [2.2 (95%CI 1.49- 3.27)], chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases [1.4(95% CI 1.05-2.00)] and diabetes [1.35(95%CI 1.06-1.73)]. CONCLUSION: Our results indicates that the mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected cancer patients is affected by preexisting non-cancer comorbidities. By identifying the comorbidities predictive for mortality, clinicians can better stratify the risk of cancer patients presenting with SARS-COV-2, on their initial contact with health services.<br />.","Kaur, Harmanjeet; Thakur, J S; Paika, Ronika; Advani, Shailesh M",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,,515

METHODS: We conducted a multicentric retrospective cohort study in 13 acute COVID-19 geriatric wards, from March 13 to April 15, 2020, in Paris area. All consecutive patients aged &#8805; 70 years, with confirmed COVID-19, were enrolled. RESULTS: Of the 821 patients included in the study, the mean (SD) age was 86 (7) years; 58% were female; 85% had &#8805; 2 comorbidities; 29% lived in an institution; and the median (interquartile range) Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADL) score was 4 [2-6]. The most common symptoms at COVID-19 onset were asthenia (63%), fever (55%), dyspnea (45%), dry cough (45%) and delirium (25%). The in-hospital mortality was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27 to 33). On multivariate analysis, at COVID-19 onset, the probability of in-hospital mortality was increased with male gender (odds ratio [OR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.30 to 2.63), ADL score < 4 (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.25 to 2.70), asthenia (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.32), quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score &#8805; 2 (OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.64 to 4.22) and specific COVID-19 anomalies on chest computerized tomography (OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.07 to 6.46).

462842,Influenza A virus exposure may cause increased symptom severity and deaths in coronavirus disease 2019,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a novel coronavirus causing the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. High adaptive plasticity on the spike protein of SASR-CoV-2 enables it to transmit across different host species. In the present study, we collected 2092 high-quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 160 regions in over 50 countries and reconstructed their phylogeny. We also analyzed the polymorphic interaction between spike protein and human ACE2 (hACE2). Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is probably originated from a recombination event on the spike protein between a bat coronavirus and a pangolin coronavirus that endows it humans infectivity. Compared with other regions in the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, the direct-binding sites of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) is more conserved. We focused on 3,860 amino acid mutations in spike protein RBD (T333-C525) of SARS-CoV-2 and simulated their differential stability and binding affinity to hACE2 (S19-D615). The results indicate no preference for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity on people of different ethnic groups. The variants in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 may also be a good indicator demonstrating the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 from its natural reservoir to human hosts.","Xue, Xia; Shi, Jianxiang; Xu, Hongen; Qin, Yaping; Yang, Zengguang; Feng, Shuaisheng; Liu, Danhua; Jian, Liguo; Hua, Linlin; Wang, Yaohe; Zhang, Qi; Huang, Xueyong; Zhang, Xiaoju; Li, Xinxin; Chen, Chunguang; Guo, Jiancheng; Tang, Wenxue; Liu, Jianbo",Sci Rep,,515

Here, we investigated the clinical characteristics and outcome of patients with solid and hematological cancers and concomitant Covid-19 at a Comprehensive Cancer Center in a Covid-19 hotspot area in Germany. METHODS: We performed a retrospective single center cohort study of 39 patients with hematological and solid cancers who were hospitalized at the University Hospital Freiburg for Covid-19. Using univariate and multivariate Cox regression models we compared time to severe events and overall survival to an age-matched control cohort of 39 patients with confirmed Covid-19 without a cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: In the cancer cohort 29 patients had a diagnosis of a solid tumor, and 10 had a hematological malignancy. In total, eight patients (21%) in the cancer and 14 patients (36%) from the noncancer cohort died during the observation period. Presence of a malignancy was not significantly associated with survival or time to occurrence of severe events. Major influences on mortality were high IL-6 levels at Covid-19 diagnosis (HR = 6.95, P = .0121) and age &#8805; 65 years (HR = 6.22, P = .0156). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to an age-matched noncancer cohort, we did not observe an association between a cancer diagnosis and a more severe disease course or higher fatality rate in patients with Covid-19. Patients with a hematological malignancy showed a trend towards a longer duration until clinical improvement and longer hospitalization time compared to patients with a solid cancer. Cancer per se does not seem to be a confounder for dismal outcome in Covid-19.","Shoumariyeh, Khalid; Biavasco, Francesca; Ihorst, Gabriele; Rieg, Siegbert; Nieters, Alexandra; Kern, Winfried V; Miething, Cornelius; Duyster, Justus; Engelhardt, Monika; Bertz, Hartmut",Cancer Med,,515

PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 73 community-living older adults with pre-existing MDD (mean age 69 [SD 6]) in Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, and St Louis. DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: During the first 2 months of the pandemic, the authors interviewed participants with a semistructured qualitative interview evaluating access to care, mental health, quality of life, and coping. The authors also assessed depression, anxiety, and suicidality with validated scales and compared scores before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: Five themes from the interviews highlight the experience of older adults with MDD: 1) They are more concerned about the risk of contracting the virus than the risks of isolation. 2) They exhibit resilience to the stress and isolation of physical distancing. 3) Most are not isolated socially, with virtual contact with friends and family. 4) Their quality of life is lower, and they worry their mental health will suffer with continued physical distancing. 5) They are outraged by an inadequate governmental response to the pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation symptom scores did not differ from scores before the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Most older adults with pre-existing MDD show resilience in the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic but have concerns about the future.

From 10 March to 1 May 2020, NewYork-Presbyterian laboratories performed 27,377 SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays from 22,338 patients. Repeat testing was performed for 3,432 patients, of which 2,413 had initial negative and 802 had initial positive results. Repeat-tested patients were more likely to have severe disease and low viral loads. The negative predictive value of the first-day result among repeat-tested patients was 81.3% The clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays was estimated between 58% and 96%, depending on the unknown number of false-negative results in single-tested patients. Conversion to negative was unlikely to occur before 15 to 20 days after initial testing or 20 to 30 days after the onset of symptoms, with 50% conversion occurring at 28 days after initial testing. Conversion from first-day negative to positive results increased linearly with each day of testing, reaching 25% probability in 20 days. Sixty patients fluctuated between positive and negative results over several weeks, suggesting that caution is needed when single-test results are acted upon. In summary, our study provides estimates of the clinical performance of SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays and suggests time frames for appropriate repeat testing, namely, 15 to 20 days after a positive test and the same day or next 2 days after a negative test for patients with high suspicion for COVID-19.","Green, Daniel A; Zucker, Jason; Westblade, Lars F; Whittier, Susan; Rennert, Hanna; Velu, Priya; Craney, Arryn; Cushing, Melissa; Liu, Dakai; Sobieszczyk, Magdalena E; Boehme, Amelia K; Sepulveda, Jorge L",J. clin. microbiol,,515

473435,Celebrex Adjuvant Therapy on Coronavirus Disease 2019: An Experimental Study,2020,"Lymphocyte depletion using anti-CD52 antibody effectively reduces relapses of multiple sclerosis (MS). To begin to understand what mechanisms might control this outcome, we examined the effect of a murine-CD52 specific monoclonal antibody on the depletion and repopulation of immune cells in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. We tested whether the tolerance-promoting receptor PD-1 is required for disease remission post anti-CD52; and found that PD-1 deficient mice with a more severe EAE were nevertheless effectively treated with anti-CD52. Anti-CD52 increased the proportions of newly generated T cells and DN T cells, while reducing newly generated B cells; the latter effect being associated with a higher expression of CD52 by these cells. In the longer-term, anti-CD52 caused substantial increases in the proportion of newly generated lymphocytes and DN T cells, in mice with EAE. Thus, the rapid repopulation of lymphocytes from central lymphoid organs post anti-CD52 may limit further disease. Furthermore, these data identify DN T cells, a subset with immunoregulatory potential, as a significant hyper-repopulating subset following CD52 mediated depletion.

476084,Association Between Collagenous and Lymphocytic Colitis and Risk of Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021,"BACKGROUND: Assessing why the spread of the COVID 19 virus slowed down in many countries in March through to May of 2020 is of great significance. The relative role of restrictions on behaviour (""lockdowns"") and of a natural slowing for other reasons is difficult to asses when mass testing was not widely done. This paper assesses the evolution of the spread of the COVID 19 virus over this period when there was not data on test results for a large, random sample of the population. METHOD: We estimate a version of the SIR model applied to data on the numbers who were tested positive in several countries over the period when the virus spread very fast and then its spread slowed sharply. Up to the end of April 2020 test data came from non random samples of populations who were overwhelmingly those who displayed symptoms. Using data from a period when the criteria used for testing (which was that people had clear symptoms) was relatively consistent is important in drawing out the message from test results. We use this data to assess two things: how large might be the group of those infected who were not recorded; how effective were lockdown measures in slowing the spread of the infection. RESULTS: We find that to match data on daily new cases of the virus, the estimated model favours high values for the number of people infected but not recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the infection may have spread far enough in many countries by April 2020 to have been a significant factor behind the fall in measured new cases. Government restrictions on behavior - lockdowns - were only one factor behind slowing in the spread of the virus.","Miles, David Kenneth; Dimdore-Miles, Oscar",Int J Clin Pract,,515

MATERIALS OF THE STUDY: This single-centre study includes patients treated for head and neck cancer (HNC) during lockdown months of March, April, May 2020 (Phase-1) and October, November and December 2020 (Phase-2);the data were compared with the same months for the previous two-year period (2018-2019). RESULTS: 35 oncological surgeries were performed at our Maxillofacial Surgery Unit in 2020. Applying both analysis of t-Student and ANOVA emerged an increase in activity for 2020. DISCUSSION: The epidemic of the 2019 novel coronavirus infection, declared a global pandemic by WHO on March 2020, has interfered with ordinary medical practice, in particular, with head and neck surgical oncology. Data for all three years (2018-19-20) were normalized for the number of beds available (in 2020, half compared to 2018-19) and were compared. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates how it is possible, following strict guidelines and standard surgical protocols, to address the growing demand for surgery on cancer patients and to contain the spread of Covid-19 infection.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of these restricted conditions on the activity of the Poison Control Center (PCC) of Policlinico Umberto I Hospital-Sapienza University of Rome. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of calls received by the PCC during the lockdown period March 9, 2020 through May 31, 2020 compared to the same time period in year 2019 (reference). RESULTS: We observed a reduction in calls from hospitals and emergency departments and an increase in calls from private citizens about exposures to products or intoxications during the lockdown. There were increases in unintentional exposures and exposures to hand and surface sanitizers among household and cleaning products. There was a decrease in calls concerning medications, which were mostly from hospitals and emergency departments. We observed increases in exposures requiring clinical observations among adults and referral to the emergency department among pre-school children. CONCLUSIONS: Public health protection measures against COVID-19 to improve hygiene and maintain clean environments can increase exposures to hazardous products in the domestic environment. We observed an increase in unintentional exposures to household and cleaning products during the lockdown and an increase in ED referrals for pre-school children compared to the previous year. Our data suggest the need for improvements in public campaigns that promote safer handling of household products and prevent unnecessary exposures during a lockdown. The public health promotion activity can benefit the community after the pandemic and prepare the community for lockdowns in the future.","Milella, Michele Stanislaw; Boldrini, Paolo; Vivino, Gabriella; Grassi, Maria Caterina",J Med Toxicol,,515

481001,Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in severe coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia,2020,"BACKGROUND: Topological index is numerical molecular descriptor that plays an important role in structureproperty/structure-activity modeling. A large number of works on multiplicative degree based indices has been developed. However, no attention is paid in investigating their chemical significance. Investigation of the chemical importance of such indices is needed. The computation of topological indices for different chemical structures and networks is a current topic of interest in mathematical chemistry. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present work is to examine the usefulness of the multiplicative degree based indices in quantitative structure property/activity relationship modeling. In addition, we intend to compute the indices for some antiCOVID-19 chemicals. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The regression analysis for octane data set is performed using MATLAB and Excel to check the predictability of the indices. The sensitivity test is conducted to examine the isomer discrimination ability. To study the indices for chemical structures preventing COVID-19, different combinatorial computation methods are utilized. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The regression models governing the structural dependence of different properties and activities are derived. The supremacy of the indices as useful molecular descriptors compared to some well-known and most used descriptors is established. Explicit expressions of the indices for hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir (GS-5734) and theaflavin are obtained. CONCLUSION: As the indices are shown to have remarkable efficiency in quantitative structure property/activity relationship modeling and isomer discrimination, the outcomes can predict different properties and activities of the chemicals under consideration.","Mondal, Sourav; De, Nilanjan; Pal, Anita; Gao, Wei",,,515

487786,Feasibility of coronavirus disease 2019 eradication,2020,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the corona virus disease-19 which is accompanied by severe pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar collapses and which stops oxygen exchange. Viral transmissibility and pathogenesis depend on recognition by a receptor in the host, protease cleavage of the host membrane and fusion. SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor. Here, we discuss the general characteristics of the virus, its mechanism of action and the way in which the mechanism correlates with the comorbidities that increase the death rate. We also discuss the currently proposed therapeutic measures and propose the use of antioxidant drugs to help patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2. Oxidizing agents come from phagocytic leukocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and eosinophils that invade tissue. Free radicals promote cytotoxicity thus injuring cells. They also trigger the mechanism of inflammation by mediating the activation of NFkB and inducing the transcription of cytokine production genes. Release of cytokines enhances the inflammatory response. Oxidative stress is elevated during critical illnesses and contributes to organ failure. In corona virus disease-19 there is an intense inflammatory response known as a cytokine storm that could be mediated by oxidative stress. Although antioxidant therapy has not been tested in corona virus disease-19, the consequences of antioxidant therapy in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury are known. It improves oxygenation rates, glutathione levels and strengthens the immune response. It reduces mechanical ventilation time, the length of stay in the intensive care unit, multiple organ dysfunctions and the length of stay in the hospital and mortality rates in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome and could thus help patients with corona virus disease-19.","Soto, María Elena; Guarner-Lans, Verónica; Soria-Castro, Elizabeth; Manzano Pech, Linaloe; Pérez-Torres, Israel",Medicina (Kaunas),,515

The morbidity is increasing due to lack of SARS-CoV-2 specific drugs. Herein, we have identified potential drugs that target the 3-chymotrypsin like protease (3CLpro), the main protease that is pivotal for the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Computational molecular modeling was used to screen 3987 FDA approved drugs, and 47 drugs were selected to study their inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 specific 3CLpro enzyme in vitro. Our results indicate that boceprevir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir, tipranavir, ivermectin, and micafungin exhibited inhibitory effect towards 3CLpro enzymatic activity. The 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation studies showed that ivermectin may require homodimeric form of 3CLpro enzyme for its inhibitory activity.

Molecular structure of three heterocyclic compounds 8,10-diphenylpyrido[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-c]pyrimidine-3(2H)-thione (HL), 8-phenyl-10-(p-tolyl)pyrido[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-c]pyrimidine-3(2H)-thione (CH3L) and10-(4-nitrophenyl)-8-phenylpyrido[3,2-e][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-c]pyrimidine-3(2H)-thione (NO2L) was studied at DFT/B3LYP/6-31G (d,p) level in ethanol solvent. Spectroscopic properties such Infrared (IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) analyses were computed. Some quantum and reactivity parameters (HOMO energy, LUMO energy, energy gap, ionization potential, electron affinity, chemical potential, global softness, lipophelicity) were studied, also molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) was performed to indicate the reactive nucleophilic and electrophilic sites. The effects of H-, CH3- and NO2- substituents on heterocyclic ligands were studied and it was found that the electron donation sites concerned with hydrogen and methyl substituents over nitro substituent. Topological analysis using reduced density gradient (RDG) was discussed in details. To predict the relevant antiviral activity of the reported heterocyclic compounds, molecular docking simulation was applied to the crystal structure of SARS-Cov-2 viral Mpro enzyme with 6WTT code and PLpro with 7JRN code. The enzymatic viral protein gives an image about the binding affinity between the target protein receptor and the heterocyclic ligands entitled. The hydrogen bonding interactions were evaluated from molecular docking with different strength for each ligand compound to discuss the efficiency of heterocyclic ligands toward viral inhibition.","El Sayed, Doaa S; Abdelrehim, El-Sayed M",Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc,,515

501915,Traditional Chinese medicine syndrome differentiation of coronavirus disease 2019 patients,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been spreading globally since December 2019, bringing with it anxieties, mortal risk, and agonizing psychological suffering. This study aimed to explore the relationship between maladaptive daydreaming (MD)-an addictive mental behavior to vivid fantasy associated with distress and functional impairment-and forced COVID-19 pandemic-related self-isolation and quarantine. Previous literature indicated that individuals employ MD for the regulation of distress and boredom, wish fulfillment, and entertainment experiences. The literature on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health identifies a flareup in psychological difficulties in the general population. In this study we explored the associations between the pandemic threat and mental health indices among individuals with MD. We surveyed 1,565 adults from over 70 countries who responded to calls for participants posted in online MD communities and other general social media sites. Probable MD was determined based on an empirically derived cut-off score on a pertinent measure. After controlling for sociodemographic variables, a series of MANCOVAs, followed by post-hoc ANCOVAs, revealed that individuals with probable MD who were observing lockdown restrictions reported having spent more time in fantasy, experienced more intense and vivid daydreaming, and had a stronger urge to daydream than other participants. Similar statistical procedures indicated that, individuals with probable MD who reported pre-existing anxiety and depression disorders described a greater urge to daydream due to the pandemic and greater difficulty to control this addictive behavior. Compared to individuals with likely normal daydreaming, individuals with suspected MD reported more pandemic-attributed deterioration on a wide array of psychological distress indices. Our data show that the current worldwide pandemic threat is connected with an elevated intensity of this addictive form of mental activity, and that MD is associated with the exacerbation of psychological distress and dysfunction rather than with beneficial regulation of the experienced stressor.","Somer, Eli; Abu-Rayya, Hisham M; Schimmenti, Adriano; Metin, Baris; Brenner, Reut; Ferrante, Erika; Göçmen, Buse; Marino, Alessia",Front Psychiatry,,515

Using a machine learning model to predict lysosomotropism these compounds were evaluated for their ability to possess a lysosomotropic mechanism in vitro. We now demonstrate in vitro that pyronaridine tetraphosphate is an inhibitor of Lysotracker accumulation in lysosomes (IC50 = 0.56 µM). Further, we evaluated antiviral synergy between pyronaridine and artesunate (Pyramax®), which are used in combination to treat malaria. Artesunate was not found to have lysosomotropic activity in vitro and the combination effect on EBOV inhibition was shown to be additive. Pyramax® may represent a unique example of the repurposing of a combination product for another disease.","Lane, Thomas R; Dyall, Julie; Mercer, Luke; Goodin, Caleb; Foil, Daniel H; Zhou, Huanying; Postnikova, Elena; Liang, Janie Y; Holbrook, Michael R; Madrid, Peter B; Ekins, Sean",Antiviral Res,,515

METHODS: Single-center, descriptive retrospective chart review of boys presenting with acute testicular torsion from March 15, to May 4, 2020 (""during COVID-19"" or group 2), as well as for the same time window in the 5-year period from 2015 to 2019 (""pre-COVID-19"" or group 1). RESULTS: A total of 78 boys met inclusion criteria, group 1 (n = 57) and group 2 (n = 21). The mean age was 12.86 ± 2.63 (group 1) and 12.86 ± 2.13 (group 2). Mean DoS before presentation at a medical facility was 23.2 ± 35.0 hours in group 1 compared with 21.3 ± 29.7 hours in group 2 (P < 0.37). When DoS was broken down into acute (<24 hours) versus delayed (&#8805;24 hours), 41 (71.9%) of 57 boys in group 1 and 16 (76.2%) of 21 boys in group 2 presented within less than 24 hours of symptom onset (P < 0.78).

In the absence of preventive medicine or a ready to use vaccine, mathematical models can provide useful scientific insights about transmission patterns and targets for drug development. In this study, we propose a within-host mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 infection considering innate and adaptive immune responses. We analyze the equilibrium points of the proposed model and obtain an expression of the basic reproduction number. We then numerically show the existence of a transcritical bifurcation. The proposed model is calibrated to real viral load data of two COVID-19 patients. Using the estimated parameters, we perform global sensitivity analysis with respect to the peak of viral load. Finally, we study the efficacy of antiviral drugs and vaccination on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results suggest that blocking the production of the virus by infected cells decreases the viral load more than reducing the infection rate of healthy cells. Vaccination is also found useful but during the vaccine development phase, blocking virus production from infected cells can be targeted for antiviral drug development.","Ghosh, Indrajit",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02936v2.pdf,515

This study aims to evidence the persistence of left ventricular (LV) systolic function (LV-SF) alterations and diastolic dysfunction (DD) in COVID-19 patients without history of cardiovascular (CV) diseases by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). (2) Methods: 125 patients, aged under 55 years, hospitalized during the first outbreak of Covid-19 for moderate pneumonia, underwent a comprehensive cardiologic examination and TTE at 6-10 weeks after discharge. Their initial in-hospital laboratory data and thorax computer tomography (TCT) were accessed from the electronic database of the hospital. (3) Results: with TTE, we documented alterations of LV-SF and DD in 8.8% of patients and in 16.8% only patterns of DD, statistically correlated with the initial levels of creatin-kinase (CK-MB) and inflammatory factors. Multivariate regression analysis evidenced that CK-MB levels, age, and body mass index (BMI) are responsible for 65% of LV-SF decrease. (4) Conclusions: Alterations of LV-SF and DD are frequent in post-acute COVID-19 infection and are responsible for the persistence of symptoms.

A large number of expressed genes, proteins, metabolites, and extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) exhibit strong associations with various clinical parameters. Multiple sets of tissue-specific proteins and exRNAs varied significantly in both mild and severe patients suggesting a potential impact on tissue function. Chronic activation of neutrophils, IFN-I signaling, and a high level of inflammatory cytokines were observed in patients with severe disease progression. In contrast, COVID-19-infected patients experiencing milder disease symptoms showed robust T-cell responses.

Having had COVID-19 and reporting higher levels of distress as well as giving up caregiving were related to perceived worsening in care-recipients well-being. Perceived increases were mainly reported by younger caregivers, those who perceived to have not coped well, and those reporting an increase in conflicts. Some caregivers perceived an increase in positive emotions.Conclusions: The pandemic has a negative impact on caregivers' perceptions about the course of their own emotions and care-recipients' well-being.Clinical implications: Interventions are needed to train caregivers in strategies to cope with the sources of stress caused by the pandemic and to promote social support.","Losada, Andrés; Vara-García, Carlos; Romero-Moreno, Rosa; Barrera-Caballero, Samara; Pedroso-Chaparro, María Del Sequeros; Jiménez-Gonzalo, Lucía; Fernandes-Pires, José; Cabrera, Isabel; Gallego-Alberto, Laura; Huertas-Domingo, Cristina; Mérida-Herrera, Laura; Olazarán-Rodríguez, Javier; Márquez-González, María",Clin Gerontol,,515
517236,Gender disparities in coronavirus disease 2019 clinical trial leadership,2021,"COVID-19 has been associated with cardiac injury and dysfunction. While both myocardial inflammatory cell infiltration and myocarditis with myocyte injury have been reported in patients with fatal COVID-19, clinical-pathologic correlations remain limited. The objective was to determine the relationships between cardiac pathological changes in patients dying from COVID-19 and cardiac infection by SARS-CoV-2, laboratory measurements, clinical features, and treatments. In a retrospective study, 41 consecutive autopsies of patients with fatal COVID-19 were analyzed for the associations between cardiac inflammation, myocarditis, cardiac infection by SARS-CoV-2, clinical features, laboratory measurements, and treatments. Cardiac infection was assessed by in situ hybridization and NanoString transcriptomic profiling. Cardiac infection by SARS-CoV-2 was present in 30/41 cases: virus+ with myocarditis (n = 4), virus+ without myocarditis (n = 26), and virus- without myocarditis (n = 11). In the cases with cardiac infection, SARS-CoV-2+ cells in the myocardium were rare, with a median density of 1 cell/cm2. Virus+ cases showed higher densities of myocardial CD68+ macrophages and CD3+ lymphocytes, as well as more electrocardiographic changes (23/27 vs 4/10; P = 0.01). Myocarditis was more prevalent with IL-6 blockade than with nonbiologic immunosuppression, primarily glucocorticoids (2/3 vs 0/14; P = 0.02). Overall, SARS-CoV-2 cardiac infection was less prevalent in patients treated with nonbiologic immunosuppression (7/14 vs 21/24; P = 0.02). Myocardial macrophage and lymphocyte densities overall were positively correlated with the duration of symptoms but not with underlying comorbidities. In summary, cardiac infection with SARS-CoV-2 is common among patients dying from COVID-19 but often with only rare infected cells. Cardiac infection by SARS-CoV-2 is associated with more cardiac inflammation and electrocardiographic changes. Nonbiologic immunosuppression is associated with lower incidences of myocarditis and cardiac infection by SARS-CoV-2.","Bearse, Mayara; Hung, Yin P; Krauson, Aram J; Bonanno, Liana; Boyraz, Baris; Harris, Cynthia K; Helland, T Leif; Hilburn, Caroline F; Hutchison, Bailey; Jobbagy, Soma; Marshall, Michael S; Shepherd, Daniel J; Villalba, Julian A; Delfino, Isabela; Mendez-Pena, Javier; Chebib, Ivan; Newton-Cheh, Christopher; Stone, James R",Mod. pathol,,515

However, some people used the data of Tieba to analyze public opinion and describe the intensity of people's emotions, but Tieba is not representative. Because whether it is in terms of popularity, number of users or age spread, the data of Weibo is more representative compared to Tieba. Therefore, this article carries out the public opinion analysis by using Python crawler to obtain data on the topic of COVID-19 in Weibo. The methods we use include word frequency analysis tools, plug-ins in the ROST content mining system, and analysis interfaces in the Baidu Brain Al open platform. The purpose of this article is to analyze the mental health level of the public, such as nervousness, fear, panic, and anxiety. By experimental results on the relevant Weibo in February and March, we find that positive emotions stood at 14.64%,neutral emotion blog posts still accounted for 66.64% and negative emotions accounted for 18.72%.In the negative segment, the general negative emotions accounted for 12.485%,the moderate negative emotions accounted for 4.9%,and the users showed a high degree of negative emotions accounted for 0.455%.And then we roughly give the relevant strategies and suggestions for some groups which have the intense negative emotions. The limitation is that we can't give them some specific suggestions for different users for the time being, which needs further research in the future. © 2020 IEEE.","Ma, X.; Wang, J.; Qin, H.; Wang, Y.","2020 International Conference on Information Science and Education, ICISE-IE 2020",,515

Related complications and death from COVID-19 disease and their underlying pathophysiology are intensely investigated. Pregnant women are among the affected. Although the severity of disease in pregnancy does not appear to be increased, the effects of infection on pregnancy should not escape careful examination. The currently known receptor for the virus, ACE2, regulates the renin-angiotensin system and is increased during pregnancy. Virus-receptor interactions may have significant effects on placental function, fetal development, and maternal immunity. The manifestation of cardiovascular complications of infection produces the hypothesis that a significant effect of the virus may be its influence on the maternal vascular system. Interference with the vascular adaptations to pregnancy and the post-partum may have implications for concurrent and future pregnancies as well as for long-term cardiovascular health. We should not miss the opportunity to learn from this virus about the physiology of pregnancy.","Zelop, Carolyn M; Bonney, Elizabeth A",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,515

To investigate the interaction of disease transmission and information dissemination dynamics, we proposed a multi-scale model which explicitly models both the disease transmission with saturated recovery rate and information transmission to evaluate the effect of information transmission on dynamic behaviors. Considering time variation between information dissemination, epidemiological and demographic processes, we obtained a slow-fast system by reasonably introducing a sufficiently small quantity. We carefully examined the dynamics of proposed system, including existence and stability of possible equilibria and existence of backward bifurcation, by using the fast-slow theory and directly investigating the full system. We then compared the dynamics of the proposed system and the essential thresholds based on two methods, and obtained the similarity between the basic dynamical behaviors of the slow system and that of the full system. Finally, we parameterized the proposed model on the basis of the COVID-19 case data in mainland China and data related to news items, and estimated the basic reproduction number to be 3.25. Numerical analysis suggested that information transmission about COVID-19 pandemic caused by media coverage can reduce the peak size, which mitigates the transmission dynamics during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Tangjuan; Xiao, Yanni",J Theor Biol,,515

METHODS: The local ethics committee approved this retrospective study and waived the need of informed consent. From March 9 to April 10, 2020, all patients referred to our institution for a clinical suspicion of COVID-19 with moderate to severe symptoms underwent a chest CT for triage. Patients with a/parenchymal lesion characteristics of COVID-19 involving at least 50% of lung parenchyma and b/positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were retrospectively included. Adrenal glands were reviewed by two independent readers to look for AAI. Additional demographics and potential biological markers of adrenal insufficiency were obtained. Correlations with ICU stay and mortality were sought. RESULTS: Out of the 219 patients with critical (n = 52) and severe lung (n = 167) parenchyma lesions, 51 (23%) had CT scan signs of AAI, which was bilateral in 45 patients (88%). Four patients had an acute biological adrenal gland insufficiency (8%). Univariate analysis in AAI+ patients demonstrated a higher rate of ICU stay (67% vs. 45%, p < 0.05) and a longer stay (more than 15 days for 31% for AAI+ vs. 19%, p < 0.05) compared with AAI- patients. Mortality rate was similar (27%, p = 0.92). CONCLUSIONS: Acute adrenal infarction on initial chest evaluation of severe COVID-19 is frequent (51/219, 23%) and might be a sign of poorer prognosis. KEY POINTS: â¢ Acute adrenal infarction on initial chest CT evaluation of severe COVID-19 is frequent (51/219). â¢ AAI might be a factor of poorer prognosis, with increased rate of ICU hospitalization and length of stay.","Leyendecker, Pierre; Ritter, Sébastien; Riou, Marianne; Wackenthaler, Antoine; Meziani, Ferhat; Roy, Catherine; Ohana, Mickaël",Eur. radiol,,515

Up to 29 February 2020, SARS-CoV-2 (HCoV-19 / 2019-nCoV) had infected more than 85 000 people in the world. In this study, we used 93 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the GISAID EpiFlu TM database to investigate the evolution and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 in the first two months of the outbreak. We constructed haplotypes of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, performed phylogenomic analyses and estimated the potential population size changes of the virus. The date of population expansion was calculated based on the expansion parameter tau ( &#964;) using the formula t= &#964;/2 u. A total of 120 substitution sites with 119 codons, including 79 non-synonymous and 40 synonymous substitutions, were found in eight coding-regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Forty non-synonymous substitutions are potentially associated with virus adaptation. No combinations were detected. The 58 haplotypes (31 found in samples from China and 31 from outside China) were identified in 93 viral genomes under study and could be classified into five groups. By applying the reported bat coronavirus genome (bat-RaTG13-CoV) as the outgroup, we found that haplotypes H13 and H38 might be considered as ancestral haplotypes, and later H1 was derived from the intermediate haplotype H3. The population size of the SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to have undergone a recent expansion on 06 January 2020, and an early expansion on 08 December 2019. Furthermore, phyloepidemiologic approaches have recovered specific directions of human-to-human transmissions and the potential sources for international infected cases.","Yu, Wen-Bin; Tang, Guang-Da; Zhang, Li; Corlett, Richard T",Zool Res,,515

Convalescent plasma therapy (CPT), a passive immunotherapy, involves infusing plasma from recovered people into actively infected people, and is thought to be a specific intervention to improve outcome in patients with severe COVID-19. The presumed mechanism involves neutralizing antibodies and antibody dependent cytotoxicity/phagocytosis. Previous CPT trials showed an effect in SARS and pilot studies suggest CPT is an effective and safe strategy for seriously ill COVID-19 patients.

However, examination of cellular RNA using single-stranded probes revealed the presence of both ( + )sense and antisense RNA transcripts (45–70 copies per cell). In this BPV-based system the inhibitory activity appeared to be associated with a nonspecific, interferon (IFN)-mediated effect. In the second approach, an expression system was used which involved 293 cells, a chimeric human cytomegalovirus (CMV)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) promoter, and methotrexate- (Mtx)-mediated gene amplification. Cells were found to express up to 7500 copies of influenza virus-specific RNA per cell at a steady state level. In this system no RNA transcripts of the opposite orientation were found.

Frail and older people are at the highest risk of mortality. The main objective of the present research was to quantify the impact of clinical frailty scale (CFS) by increasing severity of frailty and to identify other personal prognostic factors associated with increased mortality from COVID-19. METHODS: This study offers a contemporary systematic review and meta-analysis to analyse the stratified mortality risk by increasing CFS sub-categories (1–3, 4–5 and 6–9). Databases searched included EMBASE, MEDLINE, CAB Abstracts, PsychInfo, and Web of Science with end-search restriction the 18th December 2020. Publications identified via MedRevix were followed up on the 23rd March 2021 in peer-reviewed database search, and citations were updated as published. Prospective and retrospective cohort studies which reported the association between CFS and COVID-19 mortality were included. Thirty-four studies were eligible for systematic review and seventeen for meta-analysis, with 81–87% (I(2)) heterogeneity. FINDINGS: All studies [N: 34] included patients from a hospital setting, comprising a total of 18,042 patients with mean age 72.8 (Min: 56; Max: 86). The CFS 4–5 patient group had significantly increased mortality when compared to patients with CFS 1–3 [(RE) OR 1.95 (1.32 (95% CI), 2.87 (95% CI)); I(2) 81%; p = 0.0008]. Furthermore, CFS 6–9 patient group displayed an even more noticeable mortality increase when compared to patients with CFS 1–3 [(RE) OR 3.09 (2.03, 4.71); I(2) 87%; p<0.0001]. Generic inverse variance analysis of adjusted hazard ratio among included studies highlighted that CFS (p = 0.0001), male gender (p = 0.0009), National Early Warning Score (p = 0.0001), Ischaemic Heart Disease (IHD) (p = 0.07), Hypertension (HT) (p<0.0001), and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (p = 0.0009) were associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest a differential stratification of CFS scores in the context of COVID-19 infection, in which CFS 1–3 patients may be considered at lower risk, CFS 4–5 at moderate risk, and CFS 6–9 at high risk of mortality regardless of age. Overall, our study not only aims to alert clinicians of the value of CFS scores, but also highlight the multiple dimensions to consider such as age, gender and co-morbidities, even among moderately frail patients in relation to COVID-19 mortality.

NSP2 exists as stable doughnut-shaped octamers within the infected cell, representing the tail-to-tail interaction of two tetramers. Extending diagonally across the surface of each octamer are four highly basic grooves that function as binding sites for single-stranded RNA. Between the N and C-terminal domains of each monomer is a deep electropositive cleft containing a catalytic site that hydrolyzes the γ-β phosphoanhydride bond of any NTP. The catalytic site has similarity to those of the histidine triad (HIT) family of nucleotide-binding proteins. Due to the close proximity of the grooves and clefts, we investigated the possibility that the RNA-binding activity of the groove promoted the insertion of the 5′-triphosphate moiety of the RNA into the cleft, and the subsequent hydrolysis of its γ-β phosphoanhydride bond. Our results show that NSP2 hydrolyzes the γP from RNAs and NTPs through Mg(2+)-dependent activities that proceed with similar reaction velocities, that require the catalytic His(225) residue, and that produce a phosphorylated intermediate. Competition assays indicate that although both substrates enter the active site, RNA is the preferred substrate due to its higher affinity for the octamer. The RTPase activity of NSP2 may account for the absence of 5′-terminal γP on the (−) strands of the dsRNA genome segments. This is the first report of a HIT-like protein with a multifunctional catalytic site, capable of accommodating both NTPs and RNAs during γP hydrolysis.","Carpio, Rodrigo Vasquez-Del; Gonzalez-Nilo, Fernando D.; Riadi, Gonzalo; Taraporewala, Zenobia F.; Patton., John T.",Journal of Molecular Biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16934294/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283606009284; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283606009284; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc1924841?pdf=render,515

The aim of this study was to conduct a nationwide survey regarding the appropriate timing of EPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This prospective study was performed through a nationwide electronic survey. The survey consisted of 15 questions divided into three sections. The first evaluated the agreement for EPs classified as “time sensitive” and “not time sensitive”. Two other sections assessed “high-priority” and “low-priority” scenarios. Agreement was considered when > 75% of respondents answered a question in the same direction. RESULTS: The response rate was 27.2% (214/784). Among the respondents, agreement for the need to perform EP in < 72 h was only reached for variceal bleeding (93.4%). Dysphagia with alarm symptoms was the scenario in which the highest percentage of physicians (95.9%) agreed that an EP needed to be performed within a month. Less than 30% of endoscopists would perform an EP within the first 72 h for patients with mild cholangitis, non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding without hemodynamic instability, or severe anaemia without overt bleeding. In time-sensitive clinical scenarios suggestive of benign disease, none of the scenarios reached agreement in any sense. Among the time-sensitive clinical scenarios suggestive of malignancy, > 90% of the surveyed respondents considered that EP could not be postponed for > 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: There was no consensus among endoscopists about the timing of EPs in patients with pathologies considered time sensitive or in those with high-priority pathologies. Agreement was only reached in five (17%) of the evaluated clinical scenarios.

594783,Persistent Symptoms in Adult Patients 1 Year After Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Prospective Cohort Study,2021-07-05,"There exists a normative representation of family meals in contemporary Western societies which is promoted as imperative through public health programs, larger discourses and by some studies in the nutritional and public health research fields. Family meals, also called domestic commensality, are represented as convivial events and are associated with positive health and wellbeing outcomes but there is minimal evidence to show they are beneficial for family members and it is not known which aspect of the family meal could be responsible for these alleged benefits. This normative family meal image is based on a representation of the family as a peaceful unit exempt from external constraints. This narrative literature review of qualitative studies of family meals seeks to put forward the underlying premises of this representation and compare it with reports about actual practices. The results emphasize that eating together is still practiced and remains valued by family members, which is in contrast to discourses lamenting the decline of the family meal. However, the valorisation and recurrence of family meals depends on class, gender and cultural positions. There is a gap between the norm of healthy or convivial and achievable family meals, which can reinforce the so-called “mental load” and “emotion work” of those in charge of feeding the family and heighten inequalities within the household. In fact, there are many challenges to family meals which originate from external constraints or are inherent aspects of family life. The results from this review suggest that we should focus on family meals by taking into account the food work surrounding it and focussing on the interactional aspects of family meals. Ethnographic methods allow the researcher to observe the diversities and complexities of commensality as well as family dynamics and, in doing so, could provide more realistic representations of eating within the family.","Le Moal, Fairley; Michaud, Maxime; Hartwick-Pflaum, Carol Anne; Middleton, Georgia; Mallon, Isabelle; Coveney, John",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18063186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33808698/,515
595171,Non-invasive Ventilation for Pediatric Hypoxic Acute Respiratory Failure Using a Simple Anesthetic Mask With 3D Printed Adaptor: A Case Report,2021-08-24,"BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was primarily detected in 2012 and still causing disease in human and camel. Camel and bats have been identified as a potential source of virus for disease spread to human. Although, significant information related to MERS-CoV disease, spread, infection, epidemiology, clinical features have been published, A little information is available on the sequence diversity of Spike protein gene. The Spike protein gene plays a significant role in virus attachment to host cells. Recently, the information about recombinant MERS-CoV has been published. So, this work was designed to identify the emergence of any another recombinant virus in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: In this study samples were collected from both human and camels and the Spike protein gene was amplified and sequenced. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of MERS-CoV Spike protein gene were used to analyze the recombination, genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationship with selected sequences from Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: The nucleotide sequence identity ranged from 65.7% to 99.8% among all the samples collected from human and camels from various locations in the Kingdom. The lowest similarity (65.7%) was observed in samples from Madinah and Dammam. The phylogenetic relationship formed different clusters with multiple isolates from various locations. The sample collected from human in Jeddah hospital formed a closed cluster with human samples collected from Buraydah, while camel sample formed a closed cluster with Hufuf isolates. The phylogenetic tree by using Aminoacid sequences formed closed cluster with Dammam, Makkah and Duba isolates. The amino acid sequences variations were observed in 28/35 samples and two unique amino acid sequences variations were observed in all samples analyzed while total 19 nucleotides sequences variations were observed in the Spike protein gene. The minor recombination events were identified in eight different sequences at various hotspots in both human and camel samples using recombination detection programme. CONCLUSION: The generated information from this study is very valuable and it will be used to design and develop therapeutic compounds and vaccine to control the MERS-CoV disease spread in not only in the Kingdom but also globally.","Sohrab, Sayed S.; Azhar, Esam I.",J Infect Public Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034119303454; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2019.11.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31831395/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876034119303454,515

However, the increased susceptibility of this population to COVID-19 is unclear. We outline several underlying mechanisms that may explain the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 severity. Obesity has an adverse effect on respiratory physiology because increased intra-abdominal adipose tissue can interfere with lung expansion, resulting in a reduced lung compliance. Further, fat accumulation in the soft tissue of the pharynx can increase inspiratory resistance. Also, obesity may be associated with sleep apnea. Obesity is associated with several defects in cell-mediated immunity including increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Impaired adipocyte-mediated immune function results in chronically high leptin levels and low adiponectin levels and anti-inflammatory adipokines. Reduced physical activity can impair several steps of the immune response to viruses. Obesity also promotes a hypercoagulable state, leading to serious consequences. These factors may synergistically play a role in promoting the severity of the disease in obese individuals. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which obesity contributes to the severity of COVID-19 is important for developing more effective treatments.","Kimura, Takefumi; Namkoong, Ho",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220322189; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.10.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33045426/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220322189?v=s5,515

METHODS: The study used publicly available data of COVID-19 cases for the period from 2 April 2020 to 28 October 2020. Semiparametric spatial temporal models were fitted to the number of monthly confirmed cases as an outcome data, with time and district as independent variables, where district was the spatial unit, while accounting for sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: The study found significant effects of location and time, with the two interacting. The spatial distribution of COVID-19 risk showed major cities being at greater risk than rural areas. Over time, the COVID-19 risk was increasing then decreasing in most districts with the rural districts being consistently at lower risk. High proportion of elderly people was positively associated with COVID-19 risk (β = 1.272, 95% CI [0.171, 2.370]) than low proportion of elderly people. There was negative association between poverty incidence and COVID-19 risk (β = −0.100, 95% CI [−0.136, −0.065]).

METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted online from July 1 to August 10, 2020 and involved 1,023 nursing faculties in Japan. Participants were asked to respond to a questionnaire based on their experiences from April to June 2020. We calculated descriptive statistics for several measures and examined associations between professional/personal demographic factors and declines in overall research time. RESULTS Of the 1,023 participants, 71.1% were spending less time on overall research activity; 79.6% spent less time attending academic events/conferences, and 77.4% spent less time conducting experiments/surveys. In contrast, 81.2% spent more time teaching, a much greater proportion than the global scientific community in a previous survey. As for work time allocation during the pandemic, teaching was by far the one activity that participants spent the most time on. Logistic regression analysis revealed that declines in overall research time were associated with several professional demographic factors, such as type of university, current academic position, and acquisition status of Japan's major research grant (KAKENHI) (all p < .05). CONCLUSIONS Nursing faculties in Japan clearly spent less time on research, and more time on teaching during the first wave of the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic.

This species is currently considered as the main EBLV-1 reservoir. Multievent capture-recapture models were used to determine the factors influencing bat rabies transmission as this method accounts for imperfect detection and uncertainty in disease states. Considering the period of study, analyses revealed that survival and recapture probabilities were not affected by the serological status of individuals, confirming the capacity of bats to be exposed to lyssaviruses without dying. Five bats have been found with EBLV-1 RNA in the saliva at the start of the study, suggesting they were caught during virus excretion period. Among these bats, one was interestingly recaptured one year later and harbored a seropositive status. Along the survey, some others bats have been observed to both seroconvert (i.e. move from a negative to a positive serological status) and serorevert (i.e. move from a positive to a negative serological status). Peak of seroprevalence reached 34% and 70% in site A and B respectively. On one of the 2 sites, global decrease of seroprevalence was observed all along the study period nuanced by oscillation intervals of approximately 2–3 years supporting the oscillation infection dynamics hypothesized during a previous EBLV-1 study in a Myotis myotis colony. Seroprevalence were affected by significantly higher seroprevalence in summer than in spring. The maximum time observed between successive positive serological statuses of a bat demonstrated the potential persistence of neutralizing antibodies for at least 4 years. At last, EBLV-1 serological status transitions have been shown driven by age category with higher seroreversion frequencies in adults than in juvenile. Juveniles and female adults seemed indeed acting as distinct drivers of the rabies virus dynamics, hypothesis have been addressed but their exact role in the EBLV-1 transmission still need to be specified.","Robardet, Emmanuelle; Borel, Christophe; Moinet, Marie; Jouan, Dorothée; Wasniewski, Marine; Barrat, Jacques; Boué, Franck; Montchâtre-Leroy, Elodie; Servat, Alexandre; Gimenez, Olivier; Cliquet, Florence; Picard-Meyer, Evelyne",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29149215/,515

However, scant mixed methods studies have compared the IPE outcomes across these disciplines to develop evidence-based IPE. This study explored the differences in the readiness of dental, medical, and nursing students for interprofessional learning before and after IPE workshops and elucidated reasons for this disparity. METHODS: Data were obtained from dental, medical, and nursing students who participated in IPE workshops conducted at Tokyo Medical and Dental University in Japan in 2019 and 2020. The participants filled the validated Japanese version of the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) before and after attending the workshops (n = 378). Paired t-tests were performed to assess differences between the pre- and post- workshop RIPLS scores. Welch’s t-tests were deployed to evaluate interdisciplinary differences in their scores. Qualitative analyses were conducted using an explanatory sequential design with focus group discussions (FGDs) held with 17 dental students to explain the quantitative results. RESULTS: Total RIPLS scores increased significantly for every discipline after the workshops (p < 0.001). Dental students scored significantly lower pre- and post- workshop aggregates than medical and nursing students, respectively (p < 0.001). The FGDs yielded three principal themes in the explanations tendered by dental students on their lower scores: 1) dental students rarely felt the need for interprofessional collaborations, 2) dentists often worked without the need for interprofessional collaborations, and 3) dental students believed their contribution to the workshop was insufficient. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed divergences in the readiness of dental, medical, and nursing students for interprofessional learning, and the study illuminated possible reasons for these disparities. These outcomes will help develop evidence-based IPE by indicating approaches to place a higher value on interprofessional collaborations in educational environments, ameliorate the awareness of educators, and enhance the workshop facilitation style.","Numasawa, Mitsuyuki; Nawa, Nobutoshi; Funakoshi, Yu; Noritake, Kanako; Tsuruta, Jun; Kawakami, Chiharu; Nakagawa, Mina; Yamaguchi, Kumiko; Akita, Keiichi",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34293058/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255086,515

METHOD: In this prospective, randomized, comparative study, patients were assigned to receive one of the two treatment methods. First, BPPV was diagnosed with the Dix‐Hallpike test. Then, each patient was treated by either the Epley or Semont maneuver. Immediately afterward, the efficacy of treatments was evaluated with the Dix‐Hallpike test, and dizziness intensity was assessed with the visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS: This study enrolled 80 patients with posterior canal BPPV, 40 of which underwent the Epley maneuver and the other 40 underwent the Semont maneuver. In the first week, The Epley maneuver cured 37 (92.5%) of the 40 patients, and the Semont maneuver cured 36 (90%) of the 40 patients. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in the efficacy of these treatments (P = .251). Regarding dizziness intensity, VAS scores decreased from 6.48 to 1.65 after the Epley maneuver and from 6.53 to 2.18 after the Semont maneuver. Statistical analysis revealed that the Epley maneuver was superior to the Semont maneuver (P = .009) in reducing dizziness intensity.

SP‐D is recognized to bind the S protein of SARS‐CoV and enhance phagocytosis. Moreover, systemic SP‐D is widely used as a biomarker of alveolar integrity. We investigated the relation between plasma SP‐D, SARS‐type pneumonia and the SARS‐specific IgG response. Sixteen patients with SARS, 19 patients with community‐acquired pneumonia (CAP) (Streptococcus pneumonia) and 16 healthy control subjects were enrolled in the study. Plasma SP‐D and anti‐SARS‐CoV N protein IgG were measured using ELISA. SP‐D was significantly elevated in SARS‐type pneumonia [median (95% CI), 453 (379–963) ng/ml versus controls 218 (160–362) ng/ml, P < 0.05] like in patients with CAP. SP‐D significantly correlated with anti‐SARS‐CoV N protein IgG (r (2) = 0.5995, P = 0.02). The possible re‐emergence of SARS or SARS‐like infections suggests a need for minimal traumatic techniques for following the alveolar compartment, e.g. during testing of antivirals.

Given that the main target of SARS-CoV-2 are lungs leading to severe pneumonia with hyperactivation of the inflammatory cascade, we conducted a prospective study to assess alveolar inflammatory status in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. METHODS: Diagnostic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in 33 adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time PCR on nasopharyngeal swab admitted to the Intensive care unit (ICU) (n = 28) and to the Intermediate Medicine Ward (IMW) (n = 5). We analyze the differential cell count, ultrastructure of cells and Interleukin (IL)6, 8 and 10 levels. RESULTS: ICU patients showed a marked increase in neutrophils (1.24 × 10(5) ml(− 1), 0.85–2.07), lower lymphocyte (0.97 × 10(5) ml(− 1), 0.024–0.34) and macrophages fractions (0.43 × 10(5) ml(− 1), 0.34–1.62) compared to IMW patients (0.095 × 10(5) ml(− 1), 0.05–0.73; 0.47 × 10(5) ml(− 1), 0.28–1.01 and 2.14 × 10(5) ml(− 1), 1.17–3.01, respectively) (p < 0.01). Study of ICU patients BAL by electron transmission microscopy showed viral particles inside mononuclear cells confirmed by immunostaining with anti-viral capsid and spike antibodies. IL6 and IL8 were significantly higher in ICU patients than in IMW (IL6 p < 0.01, IL8 p < 0.0001), and also in patients who did not survive (IL6 p < 0.05, IL8 p = 0.05 vs. survivors). IL10 did not show a significant variation between groups. Dividing patients by treatment received, lower BAL concentrations of IL6 were found in patients treated with steroids as compared to those treated with tocilizumab (p < 0.1) or antivirals (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Alveolitis, associated with COVID-19, is mainly sustained by innate effectors which showed features of extensive activation.

Phase 2: from February 8 to 14, Guangdong Province issued the following 2 polices: applying Toujie Quwen granules to 30 designated hospitals and launching a registration and report system for the sale of fever and cough drugs. In this phase, the growth trend of confirmed cases had slowed down on February 10 and then increased slowly on February 14. The number of recovered cases increased rapidly on February 10 and then increased rapidly on February 14. 3. Phase 3: from February 15 to 26, the increase number of confirmed cases was a small in magnitude on February 20 and then increased slowly on February 26. The number of recovered cases increased rapidly on February 20 and then increased rapidly on February 26. Guangdong Province implemented 6 control policies in 3-phase and finally successfully defeated the COVID-19. In the first phase, the first 4 control policies showed initial effects on COVID-19 epidemic control. In the second phase, the last 2 control policies greatly contributed to containing the COVID-19 epidemic. In the third phase, the 6 control policies completely overcame the COVID-19 in Guangdong Province, China.","Chen, Haiqian; Shi, Leiyu; Zhang, Yuyao; Wang, Xiaohan; Sun, Gang",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33951003/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000025881,515
608550,The Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak on Emotional and Cognitive Vulnerability in Iranian Women With Breast Cancer,2021-05-31,"Hospital-acquired infections pose both a major risk to patient wellbeing and an economic burden on global healthcare systems, with the problem compounded by the emergence of multidrug resistant and biocide tolerant bacterial pathogens. Many inanimate surfaces can act as a reservoir for infection, and adequate disinfection is difficult to achieve and requires direct intervention. In this study we demonstrate the preparation and performance of materials with inherent photodynamic, surface-active, persistent antimicrobial properties through the incorporation of photosensitizers into high density poly(ethylene) (HDPE) using hot-melt extrusion, which require no external intervention except a source of visible light. Our aim is to prevent bacterial adherence to these surfaces and eliminate them as reservoirs of nosocomial pathogens, thus presenting a valuable advance in infection control. A two-layer system with one layer comprising photosensitizer-incorporated HDPE, and one layer comprising HDPE alone is also described to demonstrate the versatility of our approach. The photosensitizer-incorporated materials are capable of reducing the adherence of viable bacteria by up to 3.62 Log colony forming units (CFU) per square centimeter of material surface for methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and by up to 1.51 Log CFU/cm(2) for Escherichia coli. Potential applications for the technology are in antimicrobial coatings for, or materials comprising objects, such as tubing, collection bags, handrails, finger-plates on hospital doors, or medical equipment found in the healthcare setting.","McCoy, Colin P.; O’Neil, Edward J.; Cowley, John F.; Carson, Louise; De Baróid, Áine T.; Gdowski, Greg T.; Gorman, Sean P.; Jones, David S.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25250740/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0108500,515

METHODS: PubMed was searched for articles published in KSSTA between January 1, 2006, and December 31st, 2020, utilising the search term ‘knee arthroplasty’. 1288 articles met the inclusion criteria. The articles were evaluated using the following criteria: type of article, type of study, main topic and special topic, use of patient-reported outcome scores, number of references and citations, level of evidence (LOE), number of authors, gender of the first author and continent of origin. Three time intervals were compared: 2006–2010, 2011–2015 and 2016–2020. RESULTS: Between 2016 and 2020, publications peaked at 670 articles (52%) compared with 465 (36%) published between 2011 and 2016 and 153 articles (12%) between 2006 and 2010. While percentage of reviews (2006–2010: 0% vs. 2011–2015: 5% vs. 2016–2020: 5%) and meta-analyses (1% vs. 6% vs. 5%) increased, fewer case reports were published (13% vs. 3% vs. 1%) (p < 0.001). Interest in navigation and computer-assisted surgery decreased, whereas interest in perioperative management, robotic and individualized surgery increased over time (p < 0.001). There was an increasing number of references [26 (2–73) vs. 30 (2–158) vs. 31 (1–143), p < 0.001] while number of citations decreased [30 (0–188) vs. 22 (0–264) vs. 6 (0–106), p < 0.001]. LOE showed no significant changes (p = 0.439). The number of authors increased between each time interval (p < 0.001), while the percentage of female authors was comparable between first and last interval (p = 0.252). Europe published significantly fewer articles over time (56% vs. 47% vs. 52%), whereas the number of articles from Asia increased (35% vs. 45% vs. 37%, p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Increasing interest in the field of knee arthroplasty-related surgery arose within the last 15 years in KSSTA. The investigated topics showed a significant trend towards the latest techniques at each time interval. With rising number of authors, the part of female first authors also increased—but not significantly. Furthermore, publishing characteristics showed an increasing number of publications from Asia and a slightly decreasing number in Europe.

We performed an integrative proteo-transcriptomics analysis in SARS-CoV-2 infected Huh7 cells to map the cellular response to the invading virus over time. We identified four pathways, ErbB, HIF-1, mTOR and TNF signaling, among others that were markedly modulated during the course of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Western blot validation of the downstream effector molecules of these pathways revealed a dose-dependent activation of Akt, mTOR, S6K1 and 4E-BP1 at 24 hours post infection (hpi). However, we found a significant inhibition of HIF-1α through 24hpi and 48hpi of the infection, suggesting a crosstalk between the SARS-CoV-2 and the Akt/mTOR/HIF-1 signaling pathways. Inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway using Akt inhibitor MK-2206 showed a significant reduction in virus production.

Traditional research conferences have high CO(2) emissions as well as significant financial and travel time costs for participants. Using available technology, early career scientists Chelsie Counsell and Franziska Elmer created a global, virtual, coral reef research conference with live talks, recorded contributions, and networking events. Funding from The Company of Biologists allowed this event to be free, supporting attendance of 2700 subscribers and content contributions from 165 participants from diverse backgrounds and career stages. We provide metrics on content viewership and participation in networking activities, note the success of incorporating regionally focused sub-events, and discuss the emergence of a collaborative research project. We highlight the broad accessibility of virtual conferences as well as their increased flexibility in programming, health benefits, and cost savings. Our approach to organizing and hosting a global, low-carbon emission research conference is documented.

611352,Coronavirus disease 2019 and pediatric anesthesia,2021,"INTRODUCTION: In the event of an outbreak of a communicable respiratory illness, quarantine may become necessary. The New York Institute for All Hazard Preparedness (NYIAHP) of the State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center, in cooperation with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Healthcare Emergency Preparedness Program, (NYC DOHMH-HEPP) quarantine working group, has developed a series of clinical protocols to help health care facilities respond to such an event. PROBLEM: Two full-scale exercises (FSEs) were designed and conducted a year apart in the quarantine unit at Kings County Hospital Center (KCHC) to test the efficacy and feasibility of these quarantine protocols. The goal of these exercises was to identify the gaps in preparedness for quarantine and increase hospital readiness for such an event. METHODS: Evaluators monitored for efficient management of critical physical plants, personnel and material resources. Players were expected to integrate and practice emergency response plans and protocols specific to quarantine. In developing the exercise objectives, five activities were selected for evaluation: Activation of the Unit, Staffing, Charting/Admission, Symptom Monitoring and Infection Control, and Client Management. RESULTS: The results of the initial FSE found that there were incomplete critical tasks within all five protocols: These deficiencies were detailed in an After Action Report and an Improvement Plan was presented to the KCHC Disaster Preparedness Committee a month after the initial FSE. In the second FSE a year later, all critical tasks for Activation of the unit, Staffing and Charting/Admission were achieved. Completion of critical tasks related to Symptom Monitoring and Infection Control and Client Management was improved in the second FSE, but some tasks were still not performed appropriately. CONCLUSION: In short, these exercises identified critical needs in disaster preparedness of the KCHC Quarantine Unit. The lessons learned from this logistical exercise enabled the planning group to have a better understanding of leadership needs, communication capabilities, and infection control procedures. Kings County Hospital Center performed well during these exercises. It was clear that performance in the second exercise was improved, and many problems noted in the first exercise were corrected. Staff also felt better prepared the second time. This supports the idea that frequent exercises are vital to maintain disaster readiness. R Nathawad, PM Roblin, D Pruitt, B Arquilla.

This disease is a global challenge that demands advanced solutions to address multiple dimensions of this pandemic for health and wellbeing. Different types of medical and technological-based solutions have been proposed to control and treat COVID-19. Machine learning is one of the technologies used in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) classification whereas nature-inspired algorithms are also adopted for image optimization. In this paper, we combined the machine learning and nature-inspired algorithm for brain MRI images of COVID-19 patients namely Machine Learning and Nature Inspired Model for Coronavirus (MLNI-COVID-19). This model improves the MRI image classification and optimization for better diagnosis. This model will improve the overall performance especially the area of brain images that is neglected due to the unavailability of the dataset. COVID-19 has a serious impact on the patient brain. The proposed model will help to improve the diagnosis process for better medical decisions and performance.

For example, the recent global outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed viral infection-induced ARDS under the spotlight. Moreover, chronic lung disease ranks the third leading cause of death in the United States. Hypoxia signaling plays a diverse role in both acute and chronic lung inflammation, which could partially be explained by the divergent function of downstream target pathways such as adenosine signaling. Particularly, hypoxia signaling activates adenosine signaling to inhibit the inflammatory response in ARDS, while in chronic lung diseases, it promotes inflammation and tissue injury. In this review, we discuss the role of adenosine at the interphase of hypoxia and inflammation in ARDS and chronic lung diseases, as well as the current strategy for therapeutic targeting of the adenosine signaling pathway.","Li, Xiangyun; Berg, Nathanial K.; Mills, Tingting; Zhang, Kaiying; Eltzschig, Holger K.; Yuan, Xiaoyi",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519814/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.604944,515

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients who received systemic treatment at chemotherapy unit with diagnosis of cancer between 11 March 2020 and 11 June 2020 were included. The clinical and demographic characteristics of patients, the systemic treatments that they received (CT, IT, targeted therapies), and the stage of disease were determined. For the parameters that affect the hospitalization of COVID-19 infected patients were also determined. RESULTS: Among 1149 patients with cancer, 84 of them were infected with COVID-19, and the median age of infected patients was 61.0 (IQR: 21–84) and 60.7% of them were male. As a subtype of cancers lung cancer was more frequent in the patients who infected with COVID compared with non-infected ones and the difference was statistically significant when the underlying malignities were compared (32.1% vs 19.0%, p = 0.031). The hospitalization rate and receiving COVID-19 treatment were more frequent in metastatic patients who were receiving palliative therapy, and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.01, p = 0.03). In our study, infection rate was similar among patients treated with CT, IT and CT plus targeted therapy; however, fewer COVID-19 infections were seen at patients who received only targeted therapy. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection is more frequent in cancer patients and tends to be more severe in metastatic cancer patients receiving anticancer treatment, and the continuation of palliative cancer treatments in these patients may cause increased cancer and infection-related morbidity and mortality.","Ayhan, Murat; Laçin, Şahin; Özyükseler, Deniz T; Sürmeli, Heves; Doğan, Akif; Turan, Merve; odabas, Hatice; Turan, Nedim; Yıldırım, Mahmut Emre",J Oncol Pharm Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33961521/; https://doi.org/10.1177/10781552211015762,515

In many low- and middle-income countries, inadequate surveillance and incompleteness of death registration are important barriers. Here, we characterize how large an impact on mortality would have to be to be detectable using the uniquely detailed mortality notification data from the city of Antananarivo in Madagascar, with application to a recent measles outbreak. The weekly mortality rate of children during the 2018-2019 measles outbreak was 154% above the expected value at its peak, and the signal can be detected earlier in children than in the general population. This approach to detecting anomalies from expected baseline mortality allows us to delineate the prevalence of COVID-19 at which excess mortality would be detectable with the existing death notification system in the capital of Madagascar. Given current age-specific estimates of the COVID-19 fatality ratio and the age structure of the population in Antananarivo, we estimate that as few as 11 deaths per week in the 60-70 years age group (corresponding to an infection rate of approximately 1%) would detectably exceed the baseline. Data from 2020 will undergo necessary processing and quality control in the coming months. Our results provide a baseline for interpreting this information.","Rasambainarivo, F.; Rasoanomenjanahary, A.; Rabarison, J.

A better understanding of mechanisms underpinning virus‐associated inflammation is required to develop effective therapeutics. Here we discover that SARS‐CoV‐2 replicates rapidly in lung epithelial cells despite triggering a robust innate immune response through activation of cytoplasmic RNA‐sensors RIG‐I and MDA5. The inflammatory mediators produced during epithelial cell infection can stimulate primary human macrophages to enhance cytokine production and drive cellular activation. Critically, this can be limited by abrogating RNA sensing, or by inhibiting downstream signalling pathways. SARS‐CoV‐2 further exacerbates the local inflammatory environment when macrophages or epithelial cells are primed with exogenous inflammatory stimuli. We propose that RNA sensing of SARS‐CoV‐2 in lung epithelium is a key driver of inflammation, the extent of which is influenced by the inflammatory state of the local environment, and that specific inhibition of innate immune pathways may beneficially mitigate inflammation‐associated COVID‐19.","Thorne, Lucy G; Reuschl, Ann‐Kathrin; Zuliani‐Alvarez, Lorena; Whelan, Matthew V.X.; Turner, Jane; Noursadeghi, Mahdad; Jolly, Clare; Towers, Greg J",EMBO J,https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2021107826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34101213/,515

To study the presence of electrolyte imbalance in severe COVID-19, we investigated the frequency and consequences of changes in electrolyte and acid-base patterns over time. We performed a retrospective cohort study including 406 patients with severe COVID-19. Levels of electrolytes, base excess, pH, serum osmolality, and hematocrit, the first 2 weeks of hospitalization, were collected daily from the laboratory database and clinical data from patients’ medical records. We found that hyponatremia was present in 57% of the patients at admission and 2% in hypernatremia. However, within 2 weeks of hospitalization 42% of the patients developed hypernatremia, more frequently in critically ill patients. Lower levels of sodium and potassium during admission were associated with the need for mechanical ventilation. Decreased pH at admission was associated with both death and the need for mechanical ventilation. Hypernatremia in the ICU was combined with rising base excess and a higher pH. In the group without intensive care, potassium levels were significantly lower in the patients with severe hypernatremia. Presence of hypernatremia during the first 2 weeks of hospitalization was associated with 3.942 (95% CI 2.269–6.851) times higher odds of death. In summary, hypernatremia was common and associated with longer hospital stay and a higher risk of death, suggesting that the dynamics of sodium are an important indicator of severity in COVID-19.","Sjöström, Anna; Rysz, Susanne; Sjöström, Henrik; Höybye, Charlotte",Endocr Connect,https://doi.org/10.1530/ec-21-0265; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34156969/,515

It has a double objective: To analyse the profile of the professional who teleworked in social services and, on the other hand, to analyse the perception of teleworkers of working conditions during this period, as well as the degree to which they have been affected by them depending on whether they work face-to-face or telematically. To this end, a questionnaire was administered to Spanish social service professionals working, obtaining a sample of 560 professionals in the sector. The profile obtained in relation to teleworking may be especially useful when considering the progressive incorporation of more non-presential activity in social services, and the results show that, although teleworking has been perceived as an efficient way of overcoming the limitations to face-to-face work arising from the pandemic, both the positive and negative consequences of the implementation of this modality of work should be carefully assessed.","Morilla-Luchena, Aleix; Muñoz-Moreno, Rocío; Chaves-Montero, Alfonso; Vázquez-Aguado, Octavio",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33467723/,515

While vaccines offer a chance to treat disease, prophylactic and anti-viral treatments are still of vital importance, especially in context of the mutative ability of this group of viruses. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of viral entry, innate sensing and immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2, which control the triggers of the subsequent excessive inflammatory response. Viral evasion strategies directly target anti-viral immunity, counteracting host restriction factors and hijacking signalling pathways to interfere with interferon production. In Part I of this review, we examine SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and the described immune evasion mechanisms to provide a perspective on how the failure in initial viral sensing by infected cells can lead to immune dysregulation causing fatal COVID-19, discussed in Part II.","Coveney, Clarissa; Tellier, Michel; Lu, Fangfang; Maleki-Toyserkani, Shayda; Jones, Ruth; Bart, Valentina M T; Pring, Ellie; Alrubayyi, Aljawharah; Richter, Felix C; Scourfield, D Oliver; Rehwinkel, Jan; Rodrigues, Patrícia R S; Davies, Luke C; Gea-Mallorquí, Ester",Oxf Open Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfimm/iqaa004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192267/,515

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to review the latest evidence on how malnutrition across all its forms (under- and overnutrition and micronutrient status) may influence both susceptibility to, and progression of, COVID-19. METHODS: We synthesized information on 13 nutrition-related components and their potential interactions with COVID-19: overweight, obesity, and diabetes; protein-energy malnutrition; anemia; vitamins A, C, D, and E; PUFAs; iron; selenium; zinc; antioxidants; and nutritional support. For each section we provide: 1) a landscape review of pertinent material; 2) a systematic search of the literature in PubMed and EMBASE databases, including a wide range of preprint servers; and 3) a screen of 6 clinical trial registries. All original research was considered, without restriction to study design, and included if it covered: 1) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), or SARS-CoV viruses and 2) disease susceptibility or 3) disease progression, and 4) the nutritional component of interest. Searches took place between 16 May and 11 August 2020. RESULTS: Across the 13 searches, 2732 articles from PubMed and EMBASE, 4164 articles from the preprint servers, and 433 trials were returned. In the final narrative synthesis, we include 22 published articles, 38 preprint articles, and 79 trials. CONCLUSIONS: Currently there is limited evidence that high-dose supplements of micronutrients will either prevent severe disease or speed up recovery. However, results of clinical trials are eagerly awaited. Given the known impacts of all forms of malnutrition on the immune system, public health strategies to reduce micronutrient deficiencies and undernutrition remain of critical importance. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes will reduce the risk of serious COVID-19 outcomes.

Camel handlers, including slaughterhouse workers and herders, are at risk of acquiring MERS-CoV infections. However, there is limited evidence of infections among camel handlers in Africa. The purpose of this study was to determine the presence of antibodies to MERS-CoV in high-risk groups in Kenya. Sera collected from 93 camel handlers, 58 slaughterhouse workers and 35 camel herders, were screened for MERS-CoV antibodies using ELISA and PRNT. We found four seropositive slaughterhouse workers by PRNT. Risk factors amongst the slaughterhouse workers included being the slaughterman (the person who cuts the throat of the camel) and drinking camel blood. Further research is required to understand the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in Africa in relation to occupational risk, with a need for additional studies on the transmission of MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans, seroprevalence and associated risk factors.","Kiyong’a, Alice N.; Cook, Elizabeth A.

627273,Serum calcium as a biomarker of clinical severity and prognosis in patients with coronavirus disease 2019,2020-06-25,"Since December 2019, more than 79,000 people have been diagnosed with infection of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). A large number of medical staff were dispersed for Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID-19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization (VT) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public (GP) and 526 nurses to evaluate VT scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Results showed that the VT scores slightly increased across periods of aiding COVID-19 control, although no statistical difference was noted (P = 0.083). However, the study found lower scores for VT in nurses [median = 69; interquartile range (IQR) = 56-85] than those of the GP (median = 75.5; IQR = 62-88.3) (P = 0.017). In addition, the VT scores for front-line nurses (FLNs; median = 64; IQR = 52-75), including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (nFLNs; median = 75.5; IQR = 63-92) (P < 0.001). Interestingly, the VT scores of the GP were significantly higher than those of the FLNs (P < 0.001). However, no statistical difference was observed compared with those of nFLNs (P > 0.05). Importantly, nFLNs are more likely to suffer from VT, which might be related to two factors, namely, gender [odds ratio (OR) = 3.1717; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.247-18.808; P = 0.002] and fertility [OR = 2.072; 95%CI = 0.626-24.533; P = 0.039]. Therefore, increased attention should be paid to the psychological problems of the medical staff, especially nFLNs, and GP under the situation of the spread and control of COVID-19. Early strategies that aim to prevent and treat VT in medical staff and GP are extremely necessary.","Li, Zhenyu; Ge, Jingwu; Yang, Meiling; Feng, Jianping; Qiao, Mei; Jiang, Riyue; Bi, Jiangjiang; Zhan, Gaofeng; Xu, Xiaolin; Wang, Long; Zhou, Qin; Zhou, Chenliang; Pan, Yinbing; Liu, Shijiang; Zhang, Haiwei; Yang, Jianjun; Zhu, Bin; Hu, Yimin; Hashimoto, Kenji; Jia, Yan; Wang, Haofei; Wang, Rong; Liu, Cunming; Yang, Chun",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.29.20029322,515

Herein, the authors explored the use of telemedicine in orthopaedics as well as changes in surgical protocols, screening methods, work priorities and orthopaedic education. There was increased utilisation of telemedicine in orthopaedic training and outpatient cases as a means to provide continuity in education and care. The need to implement social distancing measures, coupled with the reduced availability of staff, has dictated that the practice of orthopaedics shifts to focus on acute care whilst redistributing resources to front-line specialities. This was facilitated by the cancellation of electives and the reduction of outpatient clinics. Thus, it is demonstrated that major changes have been implemented in many aspects of orthopaedic practice in order to address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Al-kulabi, Ali; Mansour, Mohamed A; Thahir, Azeem",J Perioper Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33550921/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1750458920971506,515

Early studies have yielded scoring rubrics focused heavily on hospitalized populations including the critically ill. Operator characteristics of this novel technology in non-critically ill, ambulatory COVID patients has not been described and is an important consideration for dissemination. The purpose of our study was to determine to the inter-rater reliability of an L-POCUS scoring rubric in a population of non-oxygen dependent patients. Methods: This was a cross sectional study design of patients at three academic institutions in the Northeast, Midwest, and West. We included subjects with respiratory complaints who tested positive for COVID-19 and maintained oxygen saturation ≥92% for two hours after presentation to the emergency department as part of a larger project focused on describing L-POCUS prognostic characteristics in a non-critically ill COVID pneumonia population. L-POCUS was performed on seven lung windows on each side of the chest: two anterior, two lateral, and three posterior. All clips were obtained with a curvilinear probe or a linear probe using machine settings to enhance lung findings (""nerve"" or ""lung""). The scoring rubric ranged from 0 to 6 for each lung field with 0 being normal lung and 6 indicating severe lung pathology from COVID. We divided lung findings into pleural and parenchymal with the score per lung field representing the sum of the two parts. Pleural findings included normal (0 points), blurring, indenting, or thickening (1 point), and discontinuity (2 points). Parenchymal findings included normal (0 points), B lines (1-3 B lines equaled 1 point, &gt;3 B lines equaled 2 points, coalescing or “waterfall” B lines equaled 3 points), and subpleural consolidation (4 points). As discontinuous pleura necessarily accompanies subpleural consolidations per definition, lung fields with subpleural consolidations automatically scored 6 points. Clips, collected and scored at bedside by an expert sonologist, were randomly selected for scoring by other operators of differing experiences: a resident, a faculty member without ultrasound fellowship training, an ultrasound fellow, and a second expert. Scores were then analyzed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) using the R package “ICC” to determine inter-rater reliability between the initial expert rater and all other raters. Results: A total of 50 clips lasting 6 seconds each were chosen for scoring, 49 with the culvilinear probe and 1 with the linear probe. The calculated Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for expert raters was 0.71 (0.55, 0.83, p&lt;0.0001) 0.83). Moderate agreement between all raters was found with an ICC of 0.72 (0.62, 0.81). The faculty member without ultrasound fellowship training and the fellow disagreed the most from the group and resulted in the highest variability. A Loess graph demonstrates less variability at low scores than high scores. Conclusion: The L-POCUS rubric for scoring lungs infected with COVID in an ambulatory population revealed moderate to good agreement among a diverse group of operators. Greater variation at higher scores reveals ambiguity in definitions of lung pathology in COVID. This warrants future studies refining criteria for lung findings and correlating to clinical implications.

Expression microarray analysis showed up-regulation and down-regulation of many genes involved in the defense, inflammatory response and intracellular signaling pathways including chemokine, apoptosis, MAPK, Notch, Jak-STAT, T-cell receptor and complement and coagulation cascades. We have revealed signature patterns of gene expression in mice infected with two different classes of pathogens: influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR results confirmed microarray results for most of the genes tested. These studies document clear differences in gene expression profiles between mice infected with influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae. Identification of genes that are differentially expressed after respiratory infections can provide insights into the mechanisms by which the host interacts with different pathogens, useful information about stage of diseases and selection of suitable targets for early diagnosis and treatments. The advantage of this novel approach is that the detection of pathogens is based on the differences in host gene expression profiles in response to different pathogens instead of detecting pathogens directly.","Zhang, Hong; Su, Yan A.; Hu, Peisheng; Yang, Jun; Zheng, Biyu; Wu, Peter; Peng, Jingzhong; Tang, Yanlin; Zhang, Lin",Microbes Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457906001870; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457906001870; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16797204/,515

This study aimed to assess the role of community belonging with the risk of potentially avoidable hospitalization among aging adults living with diabetes in Canada. Methods: The study leveraged a novel resource available through Statistics Canada's Social Data Linkage Environment: the Canadian Community Health Survey linked to administrative health records from the hospital Discharge Abstract Database. A population-representative sample of 13,580 community-dwelling adults aged 45 and over with diabetes was identified. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the association of individuals' sense of community belonging with the risk of diabetes-related hospitalization over the period 2006–2012. Results: Most (69.9%) adults with diabetes reported a strong sense of belonging to their local community. Those who reported weak community belonging were significantly more likely to have been hospitalized for diabetes (χ(2) = 13.82; p < 0.05). The association between weak community attachment and increased risk of diabetes hospitalization remained significant [adjusted OR: 1.80 (95%CI: 1.12–2.90)] after controlling for age, education, and other sociodemographic and behavioral factors. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has resurfaced attention to the need to better address social capital and diabetes care in public health strategies. While the causal pathways are unclear, this national study highlighted that deficits in social attachments may place adults with diabetes at greater risk of acute complications leading to hospitalization.","Gupta, Neeru; Sheng, Zihao",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34055729/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.670082,515

Host cell proteins (HCPs) are a major class of process-related impurities and require monitoring and documentation of their presence through development and manufacturing. Even in residual amounts, they are known to affect product quality and efficacy as well as patient safety. HCP analysis using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (HCP-ELISA) is the standard technique, due to its simple handling, short analysis time, and high sensitivity for protein impurities. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC–MS) is an orthogonal method for HCP analysis and is increasingly included in regulatory documentation. LC–MS offers advantages where HCP-ELISA has drawbacks, e.g., the ability to identify and quantify individual HCPs. This article summarizes the available knowledge about monitoring HCPs in biologics and presents the newest trends in HCP analysis with current state-of-the-art HCP measurement tools. Through case studies, we present examples of HCP control strategies that have been used in regulatory license applications, using an MS-based coverage analysis and HCP-ELISA and LC–MS for HCP quantification. This provides novel insight into the rapid evolving strategy of HCP analysis. Improvements in technologies to evaluate HCP-ELISA suitability and the implementation of orthogonal LC–MS methods for HCP analysis are important to rationally manipulate, engineer, and select suitable cell lines and downstream processing steps to limit problematic HCPs.","Pilely, Katrine; Johansen, Martin Rask; Lund, Rikke Raaen; Kofoed, Thomas; Jørgensen, Thomas Kjærsgaard; Skriver, Lars; Mørtz, Ejvind",Anal Bioanal Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34595561/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00216-021-03648-2,515

To better understand population risk and vulnerability, as well as COVID-19 transmission dynamics, it is important to build intelligent systems for monitoring isolation/quarantine and tracking by use of artificial intelligence and machine learning systems algorithms. Experiences and lessons learned from the international community is crucial for emerging pandemics prevention and control programs, especially in promoting evidence-based decision-making, integrating data and models to inform effective and sustainable RCCE strategies, such as local and global safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines and mass immunization programs.","Tambo, Ernest; Djuikoue, Ingrid C.; Tazemda, Gildas K.; Fotsing, Michael F.; Zhou, Xiao-Nong",Glob Health J,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2414644721000099; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.glohj.2021.02.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33850632/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2414644721000099,515

Data regarding in-hospital mortality and its risk factors, as well as the impact of hospital overcrowding in Latin America has not been thoroughly explored. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled consecutive adult patients hospitalized with severe confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia at a SARS-CoV-2 referral center in Mexico City from February 26th, 2020, to June 5th, 2020. A total of 800 patients were admitted with confirmed diagnosis, mean age was 51.9 ± 13.9 years, 61% were males, 85% were either obese or overweight, 30% had hypertension and 26% type 2 diabetes. From those 800, 559 recovered (69.9%) and 241 died (30.1%). Among survivors, 101 (18%) received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and 458 (82%) were managed outside the intensive care unit (ICU); mortality in the ICU was 49%. From the non-survivors, 45.6% (n = 110) did not receive full support due to lack of ICU bed availability. Within this subgroup the main cause of death was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 95% of the cases, whereas among the non-survivors who received full (n = 105) support the main cause of death was septic shock (45%) followed by ARDS (29%). The main risk factors associated with in-hospital death were male sex (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.34–3.12), obesity (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.14–2.32)—in particular morbid obesity (RR 3.38, 95%CI 1.63–7.00)—and oxygen saturation < 80% on admission (RR 4.8, 95%CI 3.26–7.31). CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found similar in-hospital and ICU mortality, as well as risk factors for mortality, compared to previous reports. However, 45% of the patients who did not survive justified admission to ICU but did not receive IMV / ICU care due to the unavailability of ICU beds. Furthermore, mortality rate over time was mainly due to the availability of ICU beds, indirectly suggesting that overcrowding was one of the main factors that contributed to hospital mortality.","Olivas-Martínez, Antonio; Cárdenas-Fragoso, José Luis; Jiménez, José Víctor; Lozano-Cruz, Oscar Arturo; Ortiz-Brizuela, Edgar; Tovar-Méndez, Víctor Hugo; Medrano-Borromeo, Carla; Martínez-Valenzuela, Alejandra; Román-Montes, Carla Marina; Martínez-Guerra, Bernardo; González-Lara, María Fernanda; Hernandez-Gilsoul, Thierry; Herrero, Alfonso Gulias; Tamez-Flores, Karla María; Ochoa-Hein, Eric; Ponce-de-León, Alfredo; Galindo-Fraga, Arturo; Kershenobich-Stalnikowitz, David; Sifuentes-Osornio, José",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33534813/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245772,515

645643,Risk factors and outcomes associated with community-onset and hospital-acquired coinfection in patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A multihospital cohort study,2021-07-26,"Rationale. Women pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic are experiencing moderate to high levels of emotional distress, which has previously been shown to be attributable to two types of pandemic-related pregnancy stress: stress associated with feeling unprepared for birth due to the pandemic (Preparedness Stress) and stress related to fears of perinatal COVID-19 infection (Perinatal Infection Stress). Objective. Given the well-documented harms associated with elevated prenatal stress and the critical importance of developing appropriately targeted interventions, we investigated factors predictive of pandemic-related pregnancy stress. Method. Between April 25 and May 15, 2020, 4,451 pregnant women in the U.S. were recruited via social media to complete an online questionnaire that included sociodemographic, medical, and COVID-19 situational factors, as well as the Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS). Binary logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for high stress. Results. Nearly 30% of participants reported high Preparedness Stress; a similar proportion reported high Perinatal Infection Stress. Abuse history, chronic illness, income loss due to the pandemic, perceived risk of having had COVID-19, alterations to prenatal appointments, high-risk pregnancy, and being a woman of color were associated with greater levels of one or both types of stress. Access to outdoor space, older age, and engagement in healthy behaviors were protective against stress. Conclusions. Practices that may alleviate pandemic-related stress such as minimizing disruptions to prenatal care, ensuring access to outdoor space, and motivating engagement in health behaviors are of vital importance. Particular attention is needed for more vulnerable populations including women of color, women with a history of abuse, and those with high-risk pregnancy. Research focused on the short and longer-term impact of pandemic-related pregnancy stress on maternal mental and physical health, perinatal outcomes, and child development is critical to identify these effects and marshal appropriate resources to reduce them.","Preis, Heidi; Mahaffey, Brittain; Heiselman, Cassandra; Lobel, Marci",Soc Sci Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32927382/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953620305670; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953620305670?v=s5,515

ACE2 is also the viral receptor of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), a related coronavirus that emerged in 2002–2003. Horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) are presumed to be the original reservoir of both viruses, and a SARS-like coronavirus, RaTG13, closely related to SARS-CoV-2, has been identified in one horseshoe-bat species. Here we characterize the ability of the S-protein receptor-binding domains (RBDs) of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, pangolin coronavirus (PgCoV), RaTG13, and LyRa11, a bat virus similar to SARS-CoV-1, to bind a range of ACE2 orthologs. We observed that the PgCoV RBD bound human ACE2 at least as efficiently as the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and that both RBDs bound pangolin ACE2 efficiently. We also observed a high level of variability in binding to closely related horseshoe-bat ACE2 orthologs consistent with the heterogeneity of their RBD-binding regions. However five consensus horseshoe-bat ACE2 residues enhanced ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses by an enzymatically inactive immunoadhesin form of human ACE2 (hACE2-NN-Fc). Two of these mutations impaired neutralization of SARS-CoV-1 pseudoviruses. An hACE2-NN-Fc variant bearing all five mutations neutralized both SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and infectious virus more efficiently than wild-type hACE2-NN-Fc. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-1 and -2 originate from distinct bat species, and identify a more potently neutralizing form of soluble ACE2.","Mou, Huihui; Quinlan, Brian D.; Peng, Haiyong; Liu, Guanqun; Guo, Yan; Peng, Shoujiao; Zhang, Lizhou; Davis-Gardner, Meredith E.; Gardner, Matthew R.; Crynen, Gogce; DeVaux, Lindsey B.; Voo, Zhi Xiang; Bailey, Charles C.; Alpert, Michael D.; Rader, Christoph; Gack, Michaela U.; Choe, Hyeryun; Farzan, Michael",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33836016/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009501,515

The objective of the present study is to identify specific clinical features of cases of GBS reported in the literature associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We searched Pubmed, and included single case reports and case series with full text in English, reporting original data of patients with GBS and a confirmed recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical data were extracted.We identified 28 articles (22 single case reports and 6 case series), reporting on a total of 44 GBS patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed through serum RT-PCR in 72.7% of cases. A total of 40 patients (91%) had symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection before the onset of the GBS. The median period between the onset of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms of the GBS was 11.2 days (range, 2-23). The most common clinical features were: leg weakness (61.4%), leg parethesia (50%), arm weakness (50.4%), arm paresthesia (50.4%), hyporeflexia/areflexia (48%), and ataxia (22.7%). 38.6% (n = 17) were found to have facial paralysis.

This process results in documented plans that provide a backbone structure for developing the core capacities to address health threats. Nevertheless, several barriers can impair an effective preparedness planning, as it needs a 360° perspective to address each component according to the best evidence and practice. Preparedness planning shares common principles with health technology assessment (HTA) as both encompass a multidisciplinary and multistakeholder approach, follow an iterative cycle, adopt a 360° perspective on the impact of intervention measures, and conclude with decision-making support. Our ""Perspective"" illustrates how each HTA domain can address different component(s) of a preparedness plan that can indeed be seen as a container of multiple HTAs, which can then be used to populate the entire plan itself. This approach can allow one to overcome preparedness barriers, providing an independent, systematic, and robust tool to address the components and ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of their value in the mitigation of the impact of emergencies.","Miglietta, Alessandro; de Waure, Chiara; Chronaki, Catherine; Wild, Claudia; Favaretti, Carlo; Timen, Aura; Edelstein, Michael; Petelos, Elena",International journal of technology assessment in health care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34269171/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462321000465,515

Thus the drug has markedly altered the subcellular distribution of the glycoproteins so that they accumulate in the internal smooth membranes but are virtually absent in the plasma membrane. These glycoproteins that accumulated in intracellular membranes have a cytoplasmic domain susceptible to protease digestion and thus are transmembranous. Under such conditions, the behavior of M protein, which plays a crucial role in virus assembly (Y. Nagai et al., 1976, Virology 69, 523–538), has been analyzed. It has been found that the M protein can neither associate with the internal membranes nor bind to the plasma membrane. Thus no virus budding has been observed, either at the plasma membranes or at internal membranes. These results substantiate the view that the interaction between M and glycoproteins is of great importance for virus assembly and suggest further that this interaction is possible only when the glycoproteins have been incorporated into the plasma membrane.","Tetsuya, Yoshida; Yasuhiro, Nakayama; Hiroshi, Nagura; Tetsuya, Toyoda; Kazuo, Nishikawa; Michinari, Hamaguchi; Yoshiyuki, Nagai",Virus Research,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0168170286900407; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168170286900407,515

Sleep apnea severity and continuous positive airway pressure compliance data were abstracted from the electronic medical record. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision was used to classify comorbidities. RESULTS: A total of 461 patients with sleep apnea tested positive for COVID-19, of whom 149 were excluded for missing data in the electronic medical record. Patients with moderate and severe sleep apnea had higher rates of COVID-19 hospitalization compared to those with mild sleep apnea (P = .003). This association was reduced when accounting for confounders, most notably the Charlson Comorbidity Index, a measure of comorbid illness burden. Moderate and severe sleep apnea were associated with increased Charlson Comorbidity Indices, compared to mild sleep apnea (P = .01). Sleep apnea severity was not associated with a composite outcome of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, and death.

657069,Unsuspected clinical presentation of coronavirus disease 2019: acute bowel disease,2020-08-08,"Vaccines are a powerful measure to protect the health of individuals and to combat outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. An ethical dilemma arises when one effective vaccine has been successfully developed against an epidemic disease and researchers seek to test the efficacy of another vaccine for the same pathogen in clinical trials involving human subjects. On the one hand, there are compelling reasons why it would be unethical to trial a novel vaccine when an effective product exists already. First, it is a firm principle of medical ethics that an effective treatment or vaccine should not be withheld from patients if their life may depend on it. Second, since epidemic outbreaks often emerge in settings with less-resourced health systems, there is a pronounced risk that any trial withholding an effective vaccine would disproportionately affect the vulnerable populations that historically have been exploited for biomedical research. Third, clinical trials for novel vaccines may be at odds with efforts to control active outbreaks. On the other hand, it may be justified to conduct a trial for a candidate vaccine if it is expected to have certain advantages compared with the existing product. This essay discusses key factors for comparing vaccines against epidemic pathogens, including immunological, logistical and economic considerations. Alongside a case study of the development of vaccines for Ebola, the essay seeks to establish a general framework that should be expanded and populated by immunologists, epidemiologists, economists and bioethicists, and ultimately could be applied to the case of COVID-19 vaccines.","Monrad, Joshua Teperowski",J Med Ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32414757/,515

Hence, healthcare workers’ attitudes ultimately have a significant role in controlling the pandemic. This study aimed to qualitatively investigate the attitudes of healthcare workers in Turkey in relation to COVID‐19 vaccines. METHODS: The study used the phenomenological approach. The sample consisted of 36 healthcare workers who were employed during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Data were collected online using focus group interviews. A total of four focus group interviews were conducted. FINDINGS: Following analysis of the data, the attitudes of healthcare workers in Turkey toward the COVID‐19 vaccine were divided into three themes: “influencing factors,” “priority group” and “trust.” CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination was found to create negative emotions among some of the healthcare workers. Their opinions about the COVID‐19 vaccines were affected by the negative emotions and burnout they experienced during the pandemic. In addition, they saw the vaccination process as impacted by contraindications and uncertainty about the duration of the protection, the balance of the benefits and harm of the vaccines, and by vaccine myths and prejudices about the country where the vaccine was developed. Healthcare professionals expressed the need for trust to be established in the whole vaccination process. They suggested that different vaccine options should be offered, that the appointment and process notification system for vaccination should be improved, that evidence‐based information about vaccines should be provided and that a safe environment should be created. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Vaccine hesitancy can be addressed by careful attention to the application of vaccination programs, correct and effective use of social media, transparent, and precise management of political processes, and the provision of evidence‐based information about the vaccines.","Aci, Ozgur Sema; Kackin, Ozlem; Karaaslan, Selver; Ciydem, Emre",Int J Nurs Knowl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34357685/; https://doi.org/10.1111/2047-3095.12342,515

In this study we evaluated the effects of the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, followed by quarantine provisions and during the three months after the resumption of activities. The study was conducted on a group of children taking part on a ABA-based intervention funded by the Local Health Authority (ASL) of the province of Caserta. In this study we considered a sample of 88 children who had been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, aged between 18 and 30 months. The following inclusion criteria were observed: age at the time of diagnosis less than 30 months, absence of other neurological, genetic, or sensorineural pathologies, and severity level 1 measured by symptoms evaluation based on the ADOS 2 module T (used for diagnosis).

660941,Case Report: Takotsubo Syndrome Associated With Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019,2021-02-22,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: As a chronic and relapsing disease, obesity impairs metabolism and causes cardiovascular diseases. Although behavioral modification is important for the treatment of obesity, it is difficult to achieve an ideal weight or sustain the process of long-term weight loss. Therefore, the obesity control guidelines strongly recommend lifestyle interventions along with medical treatment for patients who are overweight. There is sufficient evidence supporting that pharmacotherapy in combination with behavior-based interventions can result in significant weight loss and improved cardiometabolism. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent meta-analyses of new anti-obesity drugs and their weight-loss efficacy have shown that the overall placebo-subtracted weight reduction (%) for at least 12 months ranged from 2.9 to 6.8% for the following drugs: phentermine/topiramate (6.8%), liraglutide (5.4%), naltrexone/bupropion (4.0%), orlistat (2.9%), and lorcaserin (3.1%). However, very recently, on February 13, 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ordered the withdrawal of lorcaserin from markets, as a clinical trial to assess drug safety showed an increased risk of cancer. Currently, the anti-obesity medications that have been approved by the FDA for chronic weight management are orlistat, phentermine/topiramate, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide. However, they are costly and may have adverse effects in some individuals. Therefore, drug therapy should be initiated in obese individuals after weighing its benefits and risks. SUMMARY: One of the strategies for long-term obesity control is that anti-obesity medications should be tailored for specific patients depending on their chronic conditions, comorbidities, and preferences.","Tak, Young Jin; Lee, Sang Yeoup",Curr Obes Rep,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13679-020-00422-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33410104/,515

Is Surgery a Good Option?,2021-02-22,"Dendritic cells (DCs) act not only as sentinels for detection of, but also as target cells for viruses, and this can be important for viral transport and spread. All subsets of DCs are equipped with a battery of receptors recognizing virus‐associated molecular signatures, and recognition of those launches a maturation programme that results in substantial alterations of morphology, motility and the DCs' interactive properties with the extracellular matrix and scanning T cells. In addition to being sensed, viruses are internalized into DCs and, for the major proportion, processed into peptides that are subsequently presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Transmission of virus to T cells can occur after completion of their replication cycle if the intracellular milieu of the DC permits that. Alternatively, viruses can remain protected from degradation following entrapment by pattern recognition receptors in intracellular compartments, also referred to as virosomes, which translocate towards the DC/T cell interface. Most likely, transfer of virus to T cells occurs in these junctions, referred to as infectious synapses. In addition to promoting DC maturation, many viruses are able to downmodulate DC development and functions in order to evade immune recognition or to induce a generalized immunosuppression.","Pohl, Christine; Shishkova, Joana; Schneider‐Schaulies, Sibylle",Cell Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17284171/,515

METHODS: A cross-sectional study using an anonymous online questionnaire was conducted from 7 to 21 June 2020. The survey was distributed via social media and email to physicians working in Egypt through convenience sampling. RESULTS: 509 physicians participated in the study (mean age: 41.5±10.2). 138 (27.1%) participants were directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients. 159 (31.2%) participants reported severe level of COVID-19-related stigma. Participants’ mean overall COVID-19-related stigma score was 40.6±8.0. The mean subscale scores were: personalized stigma 26.0±5.7, disclosure concerns 9.3±2.2, negative self-image 6.9±1.6, and concern with public attitudes 24.4±4.9. In the multivariable regression analyses, the overall COVID-19-related stigma score was higher in participants with lower qualifications (β = -0.19, 95% CI: 2.32, -0.64, p = 0.001), and in those working in a quarantine hospital (β = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01, 7.14, p = 0.050). CONCLUSIONS: A considerable proportion of Egyptian physicians in this exploratory study experienced COVID-19-related stigmatization.

Methods CT volumes from 2,398 United States radiology practices participating in the American College of Radiology (ACR) Dose Index Registry from January 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020 were analyzed. Data were compared to projected CT volumes using 2019 normative data, and analyzed with respect to time since government orders, and population-normalized positive COVID-19 tests and attributed deaths. Data were stratified by state population density, unemployment status, and race. Results There were 16,198,830 CT examinations (2,398 practices). Volume nadir occurred an average of 32 days after each state-of-emergency declaration and 12 days after each stay-at-home order. At nadir, the projected volume loss was 38,043 CTs per day (of 71,626 CTs/day; 53% reduction). Over the entire study period, there were 3,689,874 less CT examinations performed than predicted (of 18,947,969; 19% reduction). There was less reduction in states with smaller population density (15% [169,378/1,142,247; Quartile 1] vs. 21% [1,894,152/9,140,689; Quartile 4]) and less reduction in states with a lower insured unemployed proportion (13% [279,331/2,071,251; Quartile 1] vs. 23% [1,753,521/7,496,443; Quartile 4]). By September 30, CT volume had returned to 84% (59,856/71,321) of predicted; recovery of CT volume occurred as positive COVID-19 tests rose and deaths were in decline. Conclusion COVID-19 substantially reduced United States CT volume, reflecting delayed and deferred care, especially in states with greater unemployment. Partial volume recovery occurred despite rising positive COVID-19 tests.","Davenport, Matthew S.; Fruscello, Tom; Chatfield, Mythreyi; Weinstein, Stefanie; Sensakovic, William F.; Larson, David B.",J Am Coll Radiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1546144020311492; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacr.2020.10.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1546144020311492?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33129768/,515

METHODS: Data were collected during an online survey of parents’ (N = 1000) pandemic experiences in April 2020. Parents (M = 36.5 years old, SD = 6.0; 82.1% White) with at least one child 12 years or younger reported on measures of mental health, perceived COVID-19 impacts, parental burnout, and perceived increases in children’s stress and positive behaviors. RESULTS: Path model analyses revealed that parents who perceived increased psychological impacts from COVID-19 reported higher levels of parental burnout, greater increases in children’s stress behaviors, and less positive behavior in children. Additionally, there were significant indirect effects of parental burnout on the link between COVID-19 psychological impacts and children’s behaviors. Finally, family income moderated associations between psychological impacts and children’s stress behaviors, such that the association was stronger for families with lower income. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest parents’ perceptions of how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted their mental health has implications for parent and child well-being, with stronger associations for low-income families. Given the potential for spillover effects between parents and children, promoting family well-being through practice and policy initiatives is crucial, including providing financial and caregiving relief for parents, and mental and behavioral health support for families.","Kerr, Margaret L; Fanning, Kerrie A; Huynh, Tuyen; Botto, Inés; Kim, Christina N",J Pediatr Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34405885/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab089,515
664333,Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome as an Organ Phenotype of Vascular Microthrombotic Disease: Based on Hemostatic Theory and Endothelial Molecular Pathogenesis,2019-11-28,"IMPORTANCE: Recent evidence suggests a multilevel inflammatory syndrome as a driving factor in some of the most severely ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients with overlapping features to other hyperinflammatory or autoimmune diseases. Therefore, plasma exchange is considered as potential therapy in these patients. OBJECTIVES: We characterize the longitudinal therapeutic efficacy and safety profile of plasma exchange in critically ill patients with clinical and laboratory evidences of coronavirus disease 2019–related immunopathology. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retropsective case-control study of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients treated with plasma exchange at Heidelberg University Hospital between March and December 2020. Plasma exchange–treated patients were compared with coronavirus disease 2019 patients on standard therapy matched for age, gender, disease severity, and features of hyperinflammatory syndrome. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Mortality rate and course of clinical and laboratory parameters in response to plasma exchange were assessed in coronavirus disease 2019 patients and in patients on standard care. A plasma volume of 50 mL per kg body weight or a maximum of 4 L was exchanged. RESULTS: In total, 28 critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients were treated with a median of three plasma exchange procedures per patient. No relevant complications occurred during plasma exchange therapy. Inflammatory and biochemical markers of end-organ damage and endothelial activation were significantly reduced following plasma exchange together with normalization of body temperature, improved pulmonary function, and reduced vasopressor demand. Most importantly, these improvements were maintained after the last plasma exchange. In contrast, no such effects were observed in the control group, although baseline clinical and laboratory parameters were comparable. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed improved 30-day survival in the plasma exchange group compared with the control group (67.9% vs 42.9%; p = 0.044). In a multivariable analysis, the hazard ratio for death was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.11–0.68; p = 0.005) with plasma exchange versus standard care. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our data provide further evidence for plasma exchange as a novel therapeutic strategy in a subset of critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients by potentially reversing the complex coronavirus disease 2019 immunopathology. Randomized controlled trials are underway to confirm these positive results.","Nusshag, Christian; Morath, Christian; Speer, Claudius; Kaelble, Florian; Zeier, Martin; Boxberger, Monica; Schulze-Schleithoff, Elisa; Fiedler, Mascha O.; Weigand, Markus A.; Merle, Uta",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34476404/; https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000517,515

OBJECTIVES: Safety and tolerability were the primary objectives, and clinical outcomes were exploratory. METHODS: A total of 63 patients completed a 15‐month phase 2, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study and were rerandomized 1:1 into an open‐label study of nilotinib 150 mg versus 300 mg for 12 months. RESULTS: Nilotinib was safe and tolerated, and no adverse effects seemed to be related to the drug, and no differences in adverse events were observed between groups. Exploratory clinical outcomes showed that nilotinib 300 mg was remarkably stable from baseline to 27 months using partial and total Unified Parkinson's Disease Scale (UPDRS). Nilotinib 150 mg versus 300 mg, significantly declined using partial or the sum of UPDRS Parts I and II. There was no significant difference in nilotinib 150 mg versus 300 mg using UPDRS Part III (on levodopa) and total UPDRS Parts I to III. Subgroup analysis showed that late‐start nilotinib 150 mg significantly worsened using the sum of UPDRS Parts II + III and total UPDRS Parts I to III compared with late‐start nilotinib 300 mg. Quality of life using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire in nilotinib 150 mg significantly declined between 15 and 27 months compared with nilotinib 300 mg, and there was no change in cognition using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment between groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that nilotinib is safe and tolerated in Parkinson's disease.

667919,Review of Emerging Pharmacotherapy for the Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020-05-06,"BACKGROUND N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) has been previously shown to exert beneficial effects in diverse respiratory diseases, through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. Our aim was to evaluate NAC potential impact in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, in terms of progression to severe respiratory failure (SRF) and mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS This retrospective, two-centre cohort study included consecutive patients hospitalised with moderate or severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients who received standard of care were compared with patients who additionally received NAC 600 mg bid orally for 14 days. Patients' clinical course was recorded regarding (i) the development of SRF (PO2/FiO2 <150) requiring mechanical ventilation support and (ii) mortality at 14 and 28 days. RESULTS A total of 82 patients were included, 42 in the NAC group and 40 in the control group. Treatment with oral NAC led to significantly lower rates of progression to SRF as compared to the control group (p < .01). Patients in the NAC group presented significantly lower 14- and 28-day mortality as compared to controls (p < .001 and p < .01 respectively). NAC treatment significantly reduced 14- and 28-day mortality in patients with severe disease (p < .001, respectively). NAC improved over time the PO2/FiO2 ratio and decreased the white blood cell, CRP, D-dimers and LDH levels. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, non-severe illness and NAC administration were independent predictors of 28-days survival. CONCLUSION Oral NAC administration (1200 mg/d) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia reduces the risk for mechanical ventilation and mortality. Our findings need to be confirmed by properly designed prospective clinical trials.","Assimakopoulos, Stelios F; Aretha, Diamanto; Komninos, Dimitris; Dimitropoulou, Dimitra; Lagadinou, Maria; Leonidou, Lydia; Oikonomou, Ioanna; Mouzaki, Athanasia; Marangos, Markos",Infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2021.1945675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34182881/,515

Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are an option for drug development for treating COVID-19. Here, we report the identification and characterization of two groups of mouse neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. MAbs 2H2 and 3C1, representing the two antibody groups, respectively, bind distinct epitopes and are compatible in formulating a noncompeting antibody cocktail. A humanized version of the 2H2/3C1 cocktail is found to potently neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro with half inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 12 ng/mL and effectively treat SARS-CoV-2-infected mice even when administered at as late as 24 h post-infection. We determine an ensemble of cryo-EM structures of 2H2 or 3C1 Fab in complex with the S trimer up to 3.8 Å resolution, revealing the conformational space of the antigen–antibody complexes and MAb-triggered stepwise allosteric rearrangements of the S trimer, delineating a previously uncharacterized dynamic process of coordinated binding of neutralizing antibodies to the trimeric S protein.

GA inhibits promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes in a dose dependent manner at an IC(50) value of 34 ± 3.0 μM and 20 ± 4.2 μM respectively. GA was non-toxic against THP-1 macrophage host cell line. GA was found to inhibit recombinant Leishmania donovani HMG-CoA reductase (LdHMGR) enzyme at the half-maximum inhibitory concentration of 24 ± 4.3 μM indicating the sensitivity and specificity of GA towards the enzyme. However, GA could cause only 30% reduction in HMGR activity when measured in Leishmania promastigotes treated with 34 μM of GA. Interestingly western blot analysis revealed fivefold reduced HMGR expression in GLA treated promastigotes. To further study the mode of action of GA, we used transgenic parasites overexpressing LdHMGR. Results indicated that ∼2 fold resistance was exhibited by LdHMGR overexpressing promastigotes to GA with an IC(50) value of 74 μM compared to the wild type parasite. This explained the specific binding of GA to LdHMGR enzyme. There was ∼2 fold depletion in ergosterol levels in wild type promastigotes compared to the HMGR overexpressors. This data was further validated by exogenous supplementation of GA treated cells with ergosterol and 40% reversal of growth inhibition was observed. The results obtained suggested that GA kills the parasite by affecting sterol biosynthetic pathway, especially by inhibiting the L. donovani HMGR and altering ergosterol levels. The finding from the current study shows that GA is a potential antileishmanial chemotherapeutic agent.","Dinesh, Neeradi; Neelagiri, Soumya; Kumar, Vinay; Singh, Sushma",Exp Parasitol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014489417301194; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014489417301194; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2017.02.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28242356/,515
670977,Microvascular thrombi in recurrent myocardial injury after coronavirus disease 2019 infection,2021-08-06,"BACKGROUND: Leicester was the first city in the UK to have ‘local lockdown’ measures imposed in response to high community rates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. As part of this response, a directive was issued by NHS England to offer testing of asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust (UHL) for SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Between 20 July and 14 August 2020, we invited all HCWs at UHL to attend for SARS-CoV-2 testing by nucleic acid amplification (NAAT). We combined the result of this assay with demographic information from the electronic staff record. RESULTS: A total of 1150 staff (~8% of the workforce) volunteered. The median age was 46 years (IQR 34–55), 972 (84.5%) were female; 234 (20.4%) were of South Asian and 58 (5.0%) of Black ethnicity; 564 (49.0%) were nurses/healthcare assistants. We found no cases of asymptomatic infection. In comparison, average community test positivity rate in Leicester city was 2.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Within the context of local lockdowns due to high community transmission rates, voluntary testing of asymptomatic staff has low uptake and low yield and thus its premise and cost-effectiveness should be re-considered.","Martin, Christopher A; Jenkins, David R; Patel, Prashanth; Goss, Charles; Price, Arthur; Barton, Linda; Gupta, Pankaj; Zaccardi, Francesco; Brunskill, Nigel J; Haldar, Pranab; Khunti, Kamlesh; Pareek, Manish",J Public Health (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33367759/; https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa237,515

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated the transition to online conferences and, in parallel, their democratization, by necessity. This manifests not just in the mitigation of barriers to attending traditional physical conferences but also in the presentation of new, and more importantly attainable, opportunities for young scientists to carve out a niche in the landscape of academic meetings. Here, we describe an early “proof of principle” of this democratizing power via our experience organizing the Canadian Computational Neuroscience Spotlight (CCNS; crowdcast.io/e/CCNS), a free 2-day virtual meeting that was built entirely amid the pandemic using only virtual tools. While our experience was unique considering the obstacles faced in creating a conference during a pandemic, this was not the only factor differentiating both our experience and the resulting meeting from other contemporary online conferences. Specifically, CCNS was crafted entirely by early career researchers (ECRs) without any sponsors or partners, advertised primarily using social media and “word of mouth,” and designed specifically to highlight and engage trainees. From this experience, we have distilled “10 simple rules” as a blueprint for the design of new virtual academic meetings, especially in the absence of institutional support or partnerships, in this unprecedented environment. By highlighting the lessons learned in implementing our meeting under these arduous circumstances, we hope to encourage other young scientists to embrace this challenge, which would serve as a critical next step in further democratizing academic meetings.","Rich, Scott; Diaconescu, Andreea O.; Griffiths, John D.; Lankarany, Milad",PLoS Comput Biol,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33338032/,515

Many of the state's seafood processing facilities are located in remote areas with limited health care capacity. On March 23, 2020, the governor of Alaska issued a COVID-19 health mandate (HM10) to address health concerns related to the impending influx of workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic (3). HM10 required employers bringing critical infrastructure (essential) workers into Alaska to submit a Community Workforce Protective Plan.* On May 15, 2020, Appendix 1 was added to the mandate, which outlined specific requirements for seafood processors, to reduce the risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in these high-density workplaces (4). These requirements included measures to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the workplace, including testing of incoming workers and a 14-day entry quarantine before workers could enter nonquarantine residences. After 13 COVID-19 outbreaks in Alaska seafood processing facilities and on processing vessels during summer and early fall 2020, State of Alaska personnel and CDC field assignees reviewed the state's seafood processing-associated cases. Requirements were amended in November 2020 to address gaps in COVID-19 prevention. These revised requirements included restricting quarantine groups to ≤10 persons, pretransfer testing, and serial testing (5). Vaccination of this essential workforce is important (6); until high vaccination coverage rates are achieved, other mitigation strategies are needed in this high-risk setting. Updating industry guidance will be important as more information becomes available.","Porter, Kimberly A.; Ramaswamy, Maya; Koloski, Thomas; Castrodale, Louisa; McLaughlin, Joseph",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33914728/; https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7017a4,515

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of adult visits for suspected COVID-19 between March 1 – April 30, 2020 at 15 EDs in Southern California. The primary outcomes were death or respiratory decompensation within 7-days. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) models and logistic regression to derive a risk score. We report metrics for derivation and validation cohorts, and subgroups with pneumonia or COVID-19 diagnoses. RESULTS: 26,600 ED encounters were included and 1079 experienced an adverse event. Five categories (comorbidities, obesity/BMI ≥ 40, vital signs, age and sex) were included in the final score. The area under the curve (AUC) in the derivation cohort was 0.891 (95% CI, 0.880–0.901); similar performance was observed in the validation cohort (AUC = 0.895, 95% CI, 0.874–0.916). Sensitivity ranging from 100% (Score 0) to 41.7% (Score of ≥15) and specificity from 13.9% (score 0) to 96.8% (score ≥ 15). In the subgroups with pneumonia (n = 3252) the AUCs were 0.780 (derivation, 95% CI 0.759–0.801) and 0.832 (validation, 95% CI 0.794–0.870), while for COVID-19 diagnoses (n = 2059) the AUCs were 0.867 (95% CI 0.843–0.892) and 0.837 (95% CI 0.774–0.899) respectively. CONCLUSION: Physicians evaluating ED patients with pneumonia, COVID-19, or symptoms suspicious for COVID-19 can apply the COVAS score to assist with decisions to hospitalize or discharge patients during the SARS CoV-2 pandemic.","Sharp, Adam L.; Huang, Brian Z.; Broder, Benjamin; Smith, Matthew; Yuen, George; Subject, Christopher; Nau, Claudia; Creekmur, Beth; Tartof, Sara; Gould, Michael K.",Am J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33189516/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.10.068; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720309682; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720309682?v=s5,515

Rotaviruses have a wide host range infecting a broad range of animal species, however little is known about rotavirus infection in exotic animals. In this paper we report the first characterisation of a RV strain from a giraffe calf. RESULTS: This report describes the identification and detailed molecular characterisation of a rotavirus strain detected from a 14-day-old Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), presenting with acute diarrhea. The RV strain detected from the giraffe was characterized molecularly as G10P[11]. Detailed sequence analysis of VP4 and VP7 revealed significant identity at the amino acid sequence level to Bovine RV (BoRV). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the need for continuous surveillance of RV strains in various animal populations, which will facilitate the identification of rotavirus hosts not previously reported. Furthermore, extending typical epidemiology studies to a broader host range will contribute to the timely identification of new emerging strain types.","Mulherin, Emily; Bryan, Jill; Beltman, Marijke; O'Grady, Luke; Pidgeon, Eugene; Garon, Lucie; Lloyd, Andrew; Bainbridge, John; O'Shea, Helen; Whyte, Paul; Fanning, Séamus",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19014526/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-4-46,515

METHODS: Mice were housed in normal and hygrothermal environments, and intranasally infected with influenza virus (FM1). A high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprint of Xinjiaxiangruyin was used to provide an analytical method for quality control. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to measure messenger RNA expression of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 in the TLR7 signaling pathway and virus replication in the lungs. Western blotting was used to measure the expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 proteins. Flow cytometry was used to detect the proportion of Th17/T-regulatory cells. RESULTS: Xinjiaxiangruyin effectively alleviated lung inflammation in C57BL/6 mice in hot and humid environments. Guizhimahuanggebantang significantly reduced lung inflammation in C57BL/6 mice. The expression of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 mRNA in lung tissue of WT mice in the normal environment, GZMHGBT group was significantly lower than that in the model group (P < 0.05). In WT mice exposed to the hot and humid environment, the expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 mRNA in the XJXRY group were significantly different from those in the virus group. The expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 protein in lung tissue of WT mice exposed to the normal environment, GZMHGBT group was significantly lower than those in the model group. In WT mice exposed to hot and humid environments, the expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 protein in XJXRY group were significantly different from those in the virus group. CONCLUSION: Guizhimahuanggebantang demonstrated a satisfactory therapeutic effect on mice infected with the influenza A virus (FM1 strain) in a normal environment, and Xinjiaxiangruyin demonstrated a clear therapeutic effect in damp and hot environments and may play a protective role against influenza through downregulation of the TLR7 signal pathway.","Fu, Ying-Jie; Yan, Yu-Qi; Zheng, Xiao; Shi, Shan-Shan; Wu, Sha; Jiang, Zhen-You",Chin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572491/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13020-019-0256-7,515

AIM: At such moments, society especially needs psychological support, which should be feasible, short-term, and effective. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A method of self-coping, based on the concepts of behavioral and cognitive psychology. The following principles underlie the method: a person can cope with his/her conditions; the accumulation of unconscious feelings, sensations, images leads to the development of problem states; self-awareness of them through the conscious observation leads to their attenuation and extinction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The method consists of five steps. The first step is the differentiation of feelings, sensations, and appropriate images. The second stage is the observation of one's condition related to images. In the third stage, the client observes spontaneous images and related feelings and sensations. The fourth step involves observing spontaneous images. Fifth stage: A client obtains skills of ecological behavior: A person expresses feelings but does not exhibit them in a destructive way. The Add-on tools help at jam up issues. RESULTS: The pre-pandemic experience of using this method has shown high efficiency, comprehensibility, and simplicity.

Assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome results in the cleavage and activation of caspase-1, in turn causing release of the pro-inflammatory interleukins 1-beta and 18. This activation response, while crucial to coordinated innate immune defense, can be aberrantly activated by the likes of cell-free DNA, and cause significant autoimmune pathology. Complications of autoimmunity induced by aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation have a great degree of mechanistic crossover with alloimmune injury in solid organ transplant, and stratagems to neutralize NLRP3 inflammasome activation may prove beneficial in solid organ transplant management. This article reviews NLRP3 inflammasome biology and the pathology associated with its hyperactivation, as well as the connections between NLRP3 inflammasome activation and allograft homeostasis.","Burke, Ryan M.; Dale, Bethany L.; Dholakia, Shamik",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639062/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms221910721,515

Further, remote electronic exams (E−exams) were considered as mode of assessment. Objectives: This cross-sectional study evaluated the students' experience of remote E-exams during the COVID-19 pandemic among medical sciences students in (our country). Materials and Methods: A survey of 29 questions was prepared on Google forms and distributed among students at Faculties of Medical sciences (Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Nursing and Applied Medical Sciences) at (Educational Institute). The questions include students' demographics, stress experience, and factors contributing to stress as well as behavioral changes related to remote E-exams. Responses were analyzed using descriptive, cross tabulation and Chi-square tests. Results: Among 1019 respondents, 32% reported more stress with remote E-exams. This was associated with academic major and gender. Among students with more stress during remote E-exams, the exam duration, mode of questions navigation and technical problems (exam platform and internet connectivity) appeared as the main factors related to stress in 78%, 76% and >60%, respectively. Other factors include concern regarding the teaching methods, exam environment and students' dishonesty. Remote E-exams had negative impact on students' dietary habits (increase consumption of caffeine and high energy drinks, high sugar food, fast food), sleep (reduction in sleeping hours, more consumption of insomnia medications), physical activity (less exercises) and smoking habits (increase). Conclusion: Results suggested a negative impact of E-exams on students within Medical Faculties. Robust exam platform and remote mock E-exams are recommended to reduce students' potential stress. A stress-free environment is very essential to encourage students to adopt remote E-exams, particularly if the pandemic will take longer. Various awareness programs about students' habits related to dietary, sleep quality, physical activity and smoking are highly valuable for students’ health benefits.

678773,Neutrophil extracellular traps contribute to immunothrombosis in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome,2020-09-03,"Modelling and evaluating the resilience of environmental systems has recently raised significant interest among both practitioners and researchers. However, it has not yet been used to measure the absorption and recovery capacities of a river subject to varying levels of pollution due to natural and anthropic sources of contamination within the basin. Fast worldwide population growth and climate change are contributing to an increased degradation status in surface water bodies and to a decreased efficiency of their natural self-purification processes. Decision-makers are, therefore, more and more encouraged to implement alternative management strategies focussed on improving the system resilience to current and future perturbations. To this end, a novel Water Resilience Index (WRI), based on different quality parameters, was developed, and it is here proposed to estimate the ability of the river Bacchiglione, located in Northeast Italy, absorb continuous and unpredictable changes due to potential effects of point sources of pollution, that is, urban and industrial wastewater, and still maintain its vital functions. This new index is integrated in a mathematical model, which represents the river as an influence diagram where the nodes are the gauged stations and the arcs are the fluvial reaches among the stations, to identify the river reaches in need of resilience improvement. In addition, in order to simplify the analytical procedure and lower the costs and times of the monitoring activities, a principal component analysis is also used, as it is able to reduce the number of the water quality parameters to be collected from the sampling stations, distributed along the main river, and thus to calculate a minimum WRI. The good agreement between the results obtained by both the original and minimum WRI shows the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. This approach could be applied to all basins with the same issues, and not just in the Italian case study here analysed, as it might be a valid tool to plan interventions and mitigation actions, protecting the resource from pollution risks and achieving environmental quality and Sustainable Development Goals both in the water bodies and their surrounding territories. In addition, this strategy could be integrated in the existing models supporting local decision-makers and administrators, aiming at increasing the resilience of urban and rural areas to pollution phenomena and facilitating the development of effective policies to reduce the impacts of global change on water quality.

678845,Influence of patient characteristics and immunosuppressant management on mortality in kidney transplant recipients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19),2021-01-21,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently the most concerning health problem worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 infects cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It is believed that the differential response to SARS-CoV-2 is correlated with the differential expression of ACE2. Several reports proposed the use of ACE2 pharmacological inhibitors and ACE2 antibodies to block viral entry. However, ACE2 inhibition is associated with lung and cardiovascular pathology and would probably increase the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Therefore, utilizing ACE2 soluble analogs to block viral entry while rescuing ACE2 activity has been proposed. Despite their protective effects, such analogs can form a circulating reservoir of the virus, thus accelerating its spread in the body. Levels of ACE2 are reduced following viral infection, possibly due to increased viral entry and lysis of ACE2 positive cells. Downregulation of ACE2/Ang (1-7) axis is associated with Ang II upregulation. Of note, while Ang (1-7) exerts protective effects on the lung and cardiovasculature, Ang II elicits pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic detrimental effects by binding to the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R). Indeed, AT1R blockers (ARBs) can alleviate the harmful effects associated with Ang II upregulation while increasing ACE2 expression and thus the risk of viral infection. Therefore, Ang (1-7) agonists seem to be a better treatment option. Another approach is the transfusion of convalescent plasma from recovered patients with deteriorated symptoms. Indeed, this appears to be promising due to the neutralizing capacity of anti-COVID-19 antibodies. In light of these considerations, we encourage the adoption of Ang (1-7) agonists and convalescent plasma conjugated therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This therapeutic regimen is expected to be a safer choice since it possesses the proven ability to neutralize the virus while ensuring lung and cardiovascular protection through modulation of the inflammatory response.","Issa, Hawraa; Eid, Ali H.; Berry, Bassam; Takhviji, Vahideh; Khosravi, Abbas; Mantash, Sarah; Nehme, Rawan; Hallal, Rawan; Karaki, Hussein; Dhayni, Kawthar; Faour, Wissam H.; Kobeissy, Firas; Nehme, Ali; Zibara, Kazem",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.620990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33816521/,515

Several redox-relevant micronutrients are known to contribute to an adequate immune response, including the essential trace elements zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that COVID-19 patients are characterised by Zn deficiency and that Zn status provides prognostic information. Serum Zn was determined in serum samples (n = 171) collected consecutively from patients surviving COVID-19 (n=29) or non-survivors (n=6). Data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study were used for comparison. Zn concentrations in patient samples were low as compared to healthy subjects (mean±SD; 717.4±246.2 vs 975.7±294.0 μg/L, P<0.0001). The majority of serum samples collected at different time points from the non-survivors (25/34, i.e., 73.5%) and almost half of the samples collected from the survivors (56/137, i.e., 40.9%) were below the threshold for Zn deficiency, i.e., below 638.7 μg/L (the 2.5(th) percentile in the EPIC cohort). In view that the Se status biomarker and Se transporter selenoprotein P (SELENOP) is also particularly low in COVID-19, we tested the prevalence of a combined deficit, i.e., serum Zn below 638.7 μg/L and serum SELENOP below 2.56 mg/L. This combined deficit was observed in 0.15% of samples in the EPIC cohort of healthy subjects, in 19.7% of the samples collected from the surviving COVID-19 patients and in 50.0% of samples from the non-survivors. Accordingly, the composite biomarker (SELENOP and Zn with age) proved as a reliable indicator of survival in COVID-19 by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 94.42%. We conclude that Zn and SELENOP status within the reference ranges indicate high survival odds in COVID-19, and assume that correcting a diagnostically proven deficit in Se and/or Zn by a personalised supplementation may support convalescence.","Heller, Raban Arved; Sun, Qian; Hackler, Julian; Seelig, Julian; Seibert, Linda; Cherkezov, Asan; Minich, Waldemar B.; Seemann, Petra; Diegmann, Joachim; Pilz, Maximilian; Bachmann, Manuel; Ranjbar, Alireza; Moghaddam, Arash; Schomburg, Lutz",Redox Biol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2020.101764; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231720309691?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33126054/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213231720309691,515

However, the pathogenesis of OA remains unclear. This study was performed to examine the effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus in OA progression. OA was induced in 6-week-old male Wistar rats by monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) injection, and the effects of oral administration of L. rhamnosus were examined in this OA rat model. Pain severity, cartilage destruction, and inflammation were measured in MIA-induced OA rats. The small intestines were isolated from OA rats, and the intestinal structure and inflammation were measured. Protein expression in the dorsal root ganglion was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The effects of L. rhamnosus on mRNA and protein expression in chondrocytes stimulated with interleukin (IL)-1β and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pain severity was decreased in L. rhamnosus-treated MIA-induced OA rats. The levels of expression of MCP-1, a potential inflammatory cytokine, and its receptor, CCR2, were decreased, and GABA and PPAR-γ expression were increased in L. rhamnosus-treated OA rats. The inflammation, as determined by IL-1β, and cartilage destruction, as determined by MMP3, were also significantly decreased by L. rhamnosus in OA rats. Additionally, intestinal damage and inflammation were improved by L. rhamnosus. In human OA chondrocytes, TIMP1, TIMP3, SOX9, and COL2A1 which are tissue inhibitors of MMP, and IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, were increased by L. rhamnosus. L. rhamnosus treatment led to decreased pain severity and cartilage destruction in a rat model of OA. Intestinal damage and inflammation were also decreased by L. rhamnosus treatment.

682638,Reticular skin eruption as the initial sign of coronavirus disease 2019 infection,2020-06-24,"Modular integrated construction (MiC) is a revolutionary construction method. However, the logistics management of MiC has always been a major barrier to the wider adoption of MiC. Nonetheless, this challenge can be tackled by the application of lean techniques, namely, just-in-time (JIT). Numerous studies have identified and evaluated the critical factors (CFs) required to implement JIT; however, there is no consensus among the previous studies on these CFs and their level of importance. Therefore, this research, for the first time, provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of these CFs. The systematic review identifies 42 CFs. To further provide a synthesis analysis of previous studies, a meta-analysis approach is used. This analysis is conducted on the identified CFs to evaluate their importance level and hence rank them. The results indicate that all the 42 CFs are important for applying JIT, of which seven are highly significant for successfully implementing JIT in MiC. Although the ranking obtained by meta-analysis is much more reliable than that provided in the individual studies, however, there is still a high heterogeneity in the results, which depicts the uncertain nature of the construction field. Therefore, sub-group analysis is conducted to investigate this heterogeneity and uncover the hidden patterns in the literature. This is achieved by studying the influence of predictive factors (moderators) on the importance level of CFs. This analysis shows that the economy of a country and the type of project executed are influential factors. The results further indicate that developing economies, in contrast to advanced economies, should pay more attention to three CFs. Also, the results show that seven CFs are much more important in MiC projects than the other project types. This research work is highly beneficial for theory development and for practitioners by identification of significant CFs that warrant management dedication to best apply JIT. Researchers, in particular, can consider the recommendations given here for implementing future meta-analysis studies.","Hussein, Mohamed; Zayed, Tarek",J Clean Prod,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100602/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959652620347600; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620347600?v=s5,515
683041,CALL Score and RAS Score as Predictive Models for Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020-11-07,"OBJECTIVE: Because of the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of nosocomial infections. As a result, we sought to find an effective, efficient and safe way to train healthcare workers on proper hand washing techniques. We used powdered activated carbon (PAC) as a tracer to visually display hand washing defects after the hand washing process. The real-time visual assessment of the efficacy of the hand washing technique aided in the immediate correction of errors, and this definitively improved hand hygiene techniques of the interns. METHODS: Clinical interns at the emergency department of Shengjing Hospital were included in this study and received training in relation to the six-step hand-washing technique developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). The subjects’ hand-washing defects or faults were traced using PAC and corrected accordingly. Acceptance of the PAC tracing method by the interns, and its safety, were both assessed using a questionnaire survey. RESULTS: The results indicated that the back of the hands, fingers, and the wrists were prone to hand-washing defects. The hand-washing defects were significantly reduced after targeted corrections by the trainers. Subjects reported satisfactory acceptance toward the PAC tracing method and the method was relatively safe for subjects. CONCLUSION: The PAC tracing method can visually display hand-washing defects and significantly improve the effectiveness of hand-washing training.","Feng, Guo; Jun, Han; Elaine, Gitonga; Haitao, Shen",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33623457/; https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s295551,515
683693,"Correction to: Effect of PEEP decremental on respiratory mechanics, gas exchange, pulmonary regional ventilation, and hemodynamics in patients with SARS-Cov-2-associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome",2020-12-04,"There are many different biological, chemical, or radiological agents that when added to food can result in many different types of illness. Some may be rapidly fatal; others require long-term exposure to result in illness. Some lead to short-term illness and others result in long-term complications. The universe of such agents and situations is enormous. This article summarizes some of the principal foodborne microbiological agents that clinicians and those involved with public health have to deal with. While the range of agents is broad and the list is long there are several basic mechanisms such as ingestion of preformed toxins or toxin production once a microbe is present in the intestine that facilitate sorting these agents into some logical framework. However, at the end of the day it is always key to think about ingested agents as a cause for illness, whether that illness be confined to the intestinal system or more systemic. In principle all foodborne illness is preventable and of the key messages to consumers and health care professionals is to know if you or your patient is at greater risk from foodborne illness. If one is dealing with an ‘at risk’ patient, it is important they be educated on what foods to avoid and what precautions to take to minimize the likelihood of acquiring a foodborne illness. While treating most foodborne illness is straightforward, prevention is clearly the path of choice.","Acheson, D.W.K.",Encyclopedia of Microbiology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123739445001838; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123739445001838,515
684391,The Impact of Perinatal SARS-CoV2 Infection During the Peripartum Period,2020-10-20,"Abstract Objective To investigate whether changes in youth's mental health were dependent on housing conditions during the initial Danish national COVID-19 lockdown. Design Cohort Setting The Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) at participants' 18th year of life and subsequently three weeks into the initial national lockdown (April 2020) Participants 7445 youth aged 18 to 23 Exposure Housing conditions measured as direct access to outdoor spaces, urbanicity, household density, and household composition during the lockdown. Main outcome measures Comparisons of before and during lockdown mental health parameters measured as adjusted mean difference and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for changes in scores of mental well-being (Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS)) and Quality of Life (QOL; adapted Cantril ladder). Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95 % CI for onset of low mental well-being (score [≤]20), low QoL (score [≤]5), and loneliness. Results Participants had a median age of 20 years at lockdown and were predominantly female. Youth without direct access to outdoor spaces had a greater decrease in mental well-being compared to those with a garden, mean difference: -0.83 (95 % CI -1.19,-0.48), and correspondingly greater odds of onset of low mental well-being, OR: 1.68 (95 % CI 1.15, 2.47). Youth in higher density households and those living alone also had greater odds of onset of low mental well-being (OR: 1.23 (95 % CI 1.05, 1.43) and OR: 1.47 (95 % CI 1.05, 2.07), respectively). Onset of low QoL was associated with living in denser households, as well as living alone. Living alone more than doubled odds of onset of loneliness, OR: 2.12 (95 % CI 1.59, 2.82). Conclusion Youth's mental health declined from before the pandemic to three weeks into the initial national lockdown. However, not all youth were equally affected and our findings inform policy makers that youth living alone, in denser households, and without direct access to outdoor spaces are especially vulnerable.","Groot, J.; Keller, A.

684575,Unexplained Methemoglobinemia in Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Case Report,2020-07-16,"Over the past decade, a significant increase in the circulation of infectious agents was observed. With the spread and emergence of epizootics, zoonoses, and epidemics, the risks of pandemics became more and more critical. Human and animal health has also been threatened by antimicrobial resistance, environmental pollution, and the development of multifactorial and chronic diseases. This highlighted the increasing globalization of health risks and the importance of the human–animal–ecosystem interface in the evolution and emergence of pathogens. A better knowledge of causes and consequences of certain human activities, lifestyles, and behaviors in ecosystems is crucial for a rigorous interpretation of disease dynamics and to drive public policies. As a global good, health security must be understood on a global scale and from a global and crosscutting perspective, integrating human health, animal health, plant health, ecosystems health, and biodiversity. In this study, we discuss how crucial it is to consider ecological, evolutionary, and environmental sciences in understanding the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases and in facing the challenges of antimicrobial resistance. We also discuss the application of the “One Health” concept to non-communicable chronic diseases linked to exposure to multiple stresses, including toxic stress, and new lifestyles. Finally, we draw up a list of barriers that need removing and the ambitions that we must nurture for the effective application of the “One Health” concept. We conclude that the success of this One Health concept now requires breaking down the interdisciplinary barriers that still separate human and veterinary medicine from ecological, evolutionary, and environmental sciences. The development of integrative approaches should be promoted by linking the study of factors underlying stress responses to their consequences on ecosystem functioning and evolution. This knowledge is required for the development of novel control strategies inspired by environmental mechanisms leading to desired equilibrium and dynamics in healthy ecosystems and must provide in the near future a framework for more integrated operational initiatives.","Destoumieux-Garzón, Delphine; Mavingui, Patrick; Boetsch, Gilles; Boissier, Jérôme; Darriet, Frédéric; Duboz, Priscilla; Fritsch, Clémentine; Giraudoux, Patrick; Le Roux, Frédérique; Morand, Serge; Paillard, Christine; Pontier, Dominique; Sueur, Cédric; Voituron, Yann",Front Vet Sci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2018.00014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29484301/,515
686340,Acute kidney injury and urinary biomarkers in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-2019,2020-07-20,"During crisis, trust has been found to have a buffering effect in the prevention of the deterioration of mental well-being, as trust is considered to reflect the individual's capability to gain social resources including both formal and informal support. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, political trust has been found to reduce anxiety. Taking these findings into account, this study explores the association of generalised and political trust with mental well-being on current postpartum women who were particularly at risk due to a decline in social support leaving them an increased burden of caring newborns during the pandemic. We conducted a crosssectional survey in October 2020 in Japan (n=558). Depressive symptoms (above the cutoff of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)) and Fear of Coronavirus-19 Scale (FCV–19S) scores were used as mental well-being indicators. Generalised and political trust were captured by binary variables. Results of regression analyses, in which covariates were fully adjusted, showed that higher generalised trust had a statistically significant association with lower possibility of depressive symptoms and a lower FCV-19S score, while political trust was not significantly associated with either indicator. For further understanding, we divided respondents into two groups; women living in cities where higher COVID-19 cases were reported and women living in areas with lower COVID-19 cases, to test whether the role of trust differs depending on the infection spread status. It was found that a higher generalised trust was significantly associated with a lower probability of having depressive symptoms in the areas with lower COVID-19 cases. However, statistical significance was not observed in the areas with high COVID-19 cases. This highlighted that even postpartum women who were normally capable of receiving formal and informal social support need to be taken care of in the current situation.","Matsushima, Midori; Tsuno, Kanami; Okawa, Sumiyo; Hori, Ai; Tabuchi, Takahiro",SSM Popul Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352827321001786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34485675/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827321001786; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100903,515

Because of its thrombogenic predisposition in COVID-19, the diagnosis of MINOCA syndrome is rarely thought in the patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial Infarction on electrocardiogram. In this case report, we discuss a 47-year-old male patient diagnosed with MINOCA who was followed up with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 viral pneumonia in intensive care unit. His 12-lead electrocardiogram showed “inferior STEMI”. A 30-40% stenosis was also shown in the midportion of left anterior descending artery in emergency coronary angiography. The patient had a normal computed tomographic pulmonary angiography and was discharged with a full recovery. MINOCA may be triggered by hyperinflammation or various processes due to COVID-19. To explain these processes associated with MINOCA syndrome, further clinical trials are needed.","Eroglu, Serkan Emre; Ademoglu, Enis; Bayram, Samet; Aksel, Gökhan",Medeni Med J,https://doi.org/10.5222/mmj.2021.25478; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33828892/,515
