1277,1277,1277,"Evaluation of the Replication, Pathogenicity, and Immunogenicity of Avian Paramyxovirus (APMV) Serotypes 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 in Rhesus Macaques",10.845346,8.767004,2013-10-10,"Avian paramyxoviruses (APMV) serotypes 1–9 are frequently isolated from domestic and wild birds worldwide. APMV-1 (also called Newcastle disease virus, NDV) is attenuated in non-human primates and is being developed as a candidate human vaccine vector. The vector potential of the other serotypes was unknown. In the present study, we evaluated nine different biologically- or recombinantly-derived APMV strains for the ability to replicate and cause disease in rhesus macaque model. Five of the viruses were: biologically-derived wild type (wt) APMV-2, -3, -5, -7 and -9. Another virus was a recombinant (r) version of wt APMV-4. The remaining three viruses were versions of wt rAPMV-2, -4 and -7 in which the F cleavage site had been modified to be multi-basic. Rhesus macaques were inoculated intranasally and intratracheally and monitored for clinical disease, virus shedding from the upper and lower respiratory tract, and seroconversion. Virus shedding was not detected for wt APMV-5. Very limited shedding was detected for wt rAPMV-4 and modified rAPMV-4, and only in a subset of animals. Shedding by the other viruses was detected in every infected animal, and usually from both the upper and lower respiratory tract. In particular, shedding over a number of days in every animal was observed for modified rAPMV-2, wt APMV-7, and modified rAPMV-7. Modification of the F protein cleavage site appeared to increase shedding by wt rAPMV-2 and marginally by wt rAPMV-4. All APMVs except wt APMV-5 induced a virus-specific serum antibody response in all infected animals. None of the animals exhibited any clinical disease signs. These results indicate that APMVs 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 are competent to infect non-human primates, but are moderately-to-highly restricted, depending on the serotype. This suggests that they are not likely to significantly infect primates in nature, and represent promising attenuated candidates for vector development.","Khattar, Sunil K.; Nayak, Baibaswata; Kim, Shin-Hee; Xiao, Sa; Samal, Sweety; Paldurai, Anandan; Buchholz, Ursula J.; Collins, Peter L.; Samal, Siba K.",PLoS One,281,1
2723,2723,2723,Establishment a real-time reverse transcription PCR based on host biomarkers for the detection of the subclinical cases of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis,11.008258,9.1715145,2017-05-25,"Bovine paratuberculosis (PTB) is a chronic enteric inflammatory disease of ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) that causes large economic losses in the dairy industry. Spread of PTB is mainly provoked by a long subclinical stage during which MAP is shed into the environment with feces; accordingly, detection of subclinical animals is very important to its control. However, current diagnostic methods are not suitable for detection of subclinical animals. Therefore, the current study was conducted to develop a diagnostic method for analysis of the expression of genes of prognostic potential biomarker candidates in the whole blood of cattle naturally infected with MAP. Real-time PCR with nine potential biomarker candidates was developed for the diagnosis of MAP subclinical infection. Animals were divided into four groups based on fecal MAP PCR and serum ELISA. Eight genes (Timp1, Hp, Serpine1, Tfrc, Mmp9, Defb1, Defb10, and S100a8) were up-regulated in MAP-infected cattle (p <0.05). Moreover, ROC analysis revealed that eight genes (Timp1, Hp, Serpine1, Tfrc, Mmp9, Defb1, Defb10, and S100a8) showed fair diagnostic performance (AUC≥0.8). Four biomarkers (Timp1, S100a8, Defb1, and Defb10) showed the highest diagnostic accuracy in the PCR positive and ELISA negative group (PN group) and three biomarkers (Tfrc, Hp, and Serpine1) showed the highest diagnostic accuracy in the PCR negative and ELISA positive group (NP group). Moreover, three biomarkers (S100a8, Hp, and Defb10) were considered the most reliable for the PCR positive and ELISA positive group (PP group). Taken together, our data suggest that real-time PCR based on eight biomarkers (Timp1, Hp, Serpine1, Tfrc, Mmp9, Defb1, Defb10, and S100a8) might be useful for diagnosis of JD, including subclinical stage cases.","Park, Hyun-Eui; Park, Hong-Tae; Jung, Young Hoon; Yoo, Han Sang",PLoS One,281,1
3891,3891,3891,Development and evaluation of a new real‐time RT‐PCR assay for detecting the latest H9N2 influenza viruses capable of causing human infection,10.950435,8.966841,2019-01-30,"The H9N2 subtype of avian influenza A viruses (AIV) has spread among domestic poultry and wild birds worldwide. H9N2 AIV is sporadically transmitted to humans from avian species. A total of 42 laboratory‐confirmed cases of non‐fatal human infection with the Eurasian Y280 and G1 lineages have been reported in China, Hong Kong, Bangladesh and Egypt since 1997. H9N2 AIV infections in poultry have become endemic in Asia and the Middle East and are a major source of viral internal genes for other AIV subtypes, such that continuous monitoring of H9N2 AIV is recommended. In this study, a new, one‐step, real‐time RT‐PCR assay was developed to detect two major Eurasian H9 lineages of AIV capable of causing human infection. The sensitivity of this assay was determined using in vitro‐transcribed RNA, and the detection limit was approximately 3 copies/reaction. In this assay, no cross‐reactivity was observed against RNA from H1–15 subtypes of influenza A viruses, influenza B viruses and other viral respiratory pathogens. In addition, this assay could detect the H9 hemagglutinin (HA) gene from artificially reconstituted clinical samples spiked with H9N2 virus without any non‐specific reactions. Therefore, this assay is highly sensitive and specific for H9 HA detection. The assay is useful both for diagnostic purposes in cases of suspected human infection with influenza H9N2 viruses and for the surveillance of both avian and human influenza viruses.","Saito, Shinji; Takayama, Ikuyo; Nakauchi, Mina; Nagata, Shiho; Oba, Kunihiro; Odagiri, Takato; Kageyama, Tsutomu",Microbiol Immunol,281,11

The 24-form Tai Chi may exert a protective function for CHD patients after PCI by improving anxiety and depression. METHODS: Patients who received PCI after 1–4 days were randomly assigned to the 24-form Tai Chi group (TG) and the control group (CG). The differences in anxiety and depression, using the Medical Outcomes Study 36−item Short−Form Health Survey (SF-36), before and after an average of 10 months of Tai Chi intervention were compared in both groups to analyze the effects of Tai Chi on the emotion and the life quality of CHD patients. Meanwhile, the relative levels of miR-17-92 were measured by using real-time qPCR. The association between the relative levels of miR-17-92 and the anxiety and the depression of CHD patients after PCI was analyzed. Adjusted Cox models were used to explore the effect of Tai Chi exercise in CHD patients. RESULTS: After 10 months of intervention, the changes in the anxiety subscale (P = 0.002), in the depression subscale (P = 0.008), and in the stress (P = 0.015) scores were higher in the TG group when compared to those of the CG group. The proportion of anxious (P = 0.045) and depressed subjects (P = 0.042) in the TG group was lower than that in the CG group. On the other hand, the increase in the SF-36 scores and in the relative levels of miR-17-92 was significantly higher in the TG group when compared with that of the CG group (P < 0.05). The serum level of miR-17-92 had a negative correlation with the anxiety, the depression, and the stress scores (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The 24-form Tai Chi improved the anxiety and the depression symptoms and upregulated the miR-17-92 levels in CHD patients after PCI.","Liu, Jia; Yu, Ping; Lv, Wei; Wang, Xinxin",Front Physiol,281,1

This paper defines a new synthetic measure of trade protection based on the value added in trade, capturing the effects that the tariff structure has on exporting firms that rely on imported intermediate inputs. The index, defined in a general equilibrium framework, provides a theoretically sound protection measurement in the context of GVCs. We assess trade protection by computing protection indexes at the bilateral level on both gross imports and imports to exports using the Global Trade Analysis Project computable general equilibrium model. These indexes are used to investigate the relationship between the European Union tariffs and integration of the Italian GVCs. In the case of Italy, imports to exports are overall less protected than gross imports with significant differences at the sector level. Despite the low levels of nominal protection, industrial sectors play a central role in explaining our results. EU tariffs mostly affect Italian exporting firms in the case of chemical products, wearing apparel and leather products.

Even so, volutrauma and atelectrauma may co-exist at different levels of tidal volume and PEEP, and therefore, the physiological response to the MV settings should be monitored in each patient. A personalized perioperative approach is gaining relevance in the field of intraoperative MV; in particular, many efforts have been made to individualize PEEP, giving more emphasis on physiological and functional status to the whole body. In this review, we summarized the latest findings about the optimization of PEEP and intraoperative MV in different surgical settings.

This paper presents a chronology of factors on the development of smart cities, including IoT technologies as network infrastructure. Increasing IoT nodes leads to increasing data flow, which is a potential source of failure for IoT networks. The biggest challenge of IoT networks is that the IoT may have insufficient memory to handle all transaction data within the IoT network. We aim in this paper to propose a potential compression method for reducing IoT network data traffic. Therefore, we investigate various lossless compression algorithms, such as entropy or dictionary-based algorithms, and general compression methods to determine which algorithm or method adheres to the IoT specifications. Furthermore, this study conducts compression experiments using entropy (Huffman, Adaptive Huffman) and Dictionary (LZ77, LZ78) as well as five different types of datasets of the IoT data traffic. Though the above algorithms can alleviate the IoT data traffic, adaptive Huffman gave the best compression algorithm. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to propose a conceptual compression method for IoT data traffic by improving an adaptive Huffman based on deep learning concepts using weights, pruning, and pooling in the neural network. The proposed algorithm is believed to obtain a better compression ratio. Additionally, in this paper, we also discuss the challenges of applying the proposed algorithm to IoT data compression due to the limitations of IoT memory and IoT processor, which later it can be implemented in IoT networks.","Nasif, Ammar; Othman, Zulaiha Ali; Sani, Nor Samsiah",Sensors (Basel),281,20

Brief digital interventions have been shown to improve youth mental health, but little is known about which digital interventions are most effective. AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of two digital single-session interventions (Shamiri-Digital and Digital-CBT (cognitive-behavioural therapy)) among Kenyan adolescents. METHODS: We will perform a school-based comparative effectiveness randomised controlled trial. Approximately 926 Kenyan adolescents will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Shamiri-Digital (focused on gratitude, growth mindsets and values), Digital-CBT (focused on behavioural activation, cognitive restructuring and problem solving) or a study-skills control condition (focused on note-taking and essay writing skills). The primary outcomes include depressive symptoms (measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-8), anxiety symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener-7) and subjective well-being (Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale). The secondary outcomes include acceptability, appropriateness, primary control and secondary control. Acceptability and appropriateness will be measured immediately post-intervention; other outcomes will be measured 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 12 weeks post-intervention. RESULTS: We hypothesise that adolescents assigned to Shamiri-Digital and adolescents assigned to Digital-CBT will experience greater improvements (assessed via hierarchical linear models) than those assigned to the control group. We will also compare Shamiri-Digital with Digital-CBT, although we do not have a preplanned hypothesis.

Repair of CNS axons after SCI remains a therapeutic challenge, despite current efforts. SCI disrupts inspiratory signals originating in the rostral ventral respiratory group (rVRG) of the medulla from their phrenic motor neuron (PhMN) targets, resulting in loss of diaphragm function. Using a rat model of cervical hemisection SCI, we aimed to restore rVRG-PhMN-diaphragm circuitry by stimulating regeneration of injured rVRG axons via targeted induction of Rheb (ras homolog enriched in brain), a signaling molecule that regulates neuronal-intrinsic axon growth potential. Following C2 hemisection, we performed intra-rVRG injection of an adeno-associated virus serotype-2 (AAV2) vector that drives expression of a constitutively-active form of Rheb (cRheb). rVRG neuron-specific cRheb expression robustly increased mTOR pathway activity within the transduced rVRG neuron population ipsilateral to the hemisection, as assessed by levels of phosphorylated ribosomal S6 kinase. By co-injecting our novel AAV2-mCherry/WGA anterograde/trans-synaptic axonal tracer into rVRG, we found that cRheb expression promoted regeneration of injured rVRG axons into the lesion site, while we observed no rVRG axon regrowth with AAV2-GFP control. AAV2-cRheb also significantly reduced rVRG axonal dieback within the intact spinal cord rostral to the lesion. However, cRheb expression did not promote any recovery of ipsilateral hemi-diaphragm function, as assessed by inspiratory electromyography (EMG) burst amplitudes. This lack of functional recovery was likely because regrowing rVRG fibers did not extend back into the caudal spinal cord to synaptically reinnervate PhMNs that we retrogradely-labeled with cholera toxin B from the ipsilateral hemi-diaphragm. Our findings demonstrate that enhancing neuronal-intrinsic axon growth capacity can promote regeneration of injured bulbospinal respiratory axons after SCI, but this strategy may need to be combined with other manipulations to achieve reconnection of damaged neural circuitry and ultimately recovery of diaphragm function.","Urban, Mark W; Ghosh, Biswarup; Strojny, Laura R; Block, Cole G; Blazejewski, Sara M; Wright, Megan C; Smith, George M; Lepore, Angelo C",Experimental neurology,281,0

Methods A cross sectional study was designed to evaluate patients admitted for vertebral fractures with diagnosis of COVID-19 infection on February and March 2020. Analysis was made based on clinical and laboratory data along with the imaging findings from chest HRCT. Results Seven patients with spine trauma including five males and two females ranging from 14 to 59 years were diagnosed for COVID-19 infection through CT-scan findings. Except one, all other patients were asymptomatic for COVID-19 at the time of admission. In three cases the COVID diagnosis was made the day after arrival and in others after 10, 14 and 35 days. Five patients were treated surgically among whom four were admitted to ICU soon after the surgery. The mean ICU stay for operated patients were eight days and the mean hospital stay was 22.6 days. Conclusion Proper diagnosis of COVID-19 is the keystone to protect both patients and health care providers. During the pandemic all admitted patients should be screened for COVID-19 infection.

MAIN MESSAGE Notable changes in the 2020 edition of the RBR include the recommendations to limit or avoid consumption of highly processed foods high in dietary sodium, to ensure safe sleep (healthy infants should sleep on their backs and on a firm surface for every sleep, and should sleep in a crib, cradle, or bassinette in the parents' room for the first 6 months of life), to not swaddle infants after they attempt to roll, to inquire about food insecurity, to encourage parents to read and sing to infants and children, to limit screen time for children younger than 2 years of age (although it is accepted for videocalling), to educate parents on risks and harms associated with e-cigarettes and cannabis, to avoid pesticide use, to wash all fruits and vegetables that cannot be peeled, to be aware of the new Canadian Caries Risk Assessment Tool, to note new red flags for cerebral palsy and neurodevelopmental problems, and to pay attention to updated high-risk groups for lead and anemia screening. CONCLUSION The RBR endeavours to guide clinicians in providing evidence-informed primary care to Canadian children. The revisions are rigorously considered and are based on appraisal of a growing, albeit still limited, evidence base for pediatric preventive care.","Li, Patricia; Rowan-Legg, Anne; Kwok, Bruce; Bayoumi, Imaan; Arulthas, Stephani; Tedone, Emmanuela; Leduc, Denis; Rourke, James; Rourke, Leslie",Canadian family physician Medecin de famille canadien,281,27

SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia currently represents a worldwide health problem; the correlations between cardiovascular disease, myocardial injury and SARS-CoV-2 infection are still unclear, but initial data show that myocardial damage represents a negative prognostic factor. Myocardial injury during SARS-CoV-2, as defined by a pathological rise in circulating troponin levels, is not an uncommon complication in hospitalized patients, and is significantly more frequent in intensive care unit patients and among those who died. In this setting, myocardial injury is mainly secondary to type 2 myocardial infarction (mismatch in myocardial oxygen supply and demand during respiratory failure); other causes include myocarditis, coronary thrombosis, sepsis or septic shock. At present, only few cases of TTS have been described during SARS-CoV-2. Here we report the case of a patient hospitalized for pneumonia and respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 with subsequent onset of TTS triggered by both physical and emotional events.","Moderato, Luca; Monello, Alberto; Lazzeroni, Davide; Binno, Simone; Giacalone, Rossella; Ferraro, Stefano; Piepoli, Massimo Francesco; Villani, Giovanni Quinto",Giornale italiano di cardiologia,281,1

Herein, we explored a nerve stimulator (NS)-guided brachial plexus block (BPB) in a rat model. The anatomy of the brachial plexus in rats was delineated in cadavers, and various BPBs were examined. The puncture point was located 0.5-1.0 cm below the lateral one-third of the clavicle. The efficacy and safety of the NS-guided BPB were evaluated using an injection of 2% lidocaine or 0.5% bupivacaine in 16 live animals; saline injection was used as a control. Both sides of the brachial plexus were located successfully using the NS-guided technique. Sensory blockade (nociception assessment) and motor blockade (grasping and straightening tests) appeared after application of the two classical local anesthetics, but not normal saline. The motor and sensory blockade induced by bupivacaine exhibited a longer duration than that induced by lidocaine ( p < 0.05). All rats recovered uneventfully from general anesthesia and BPB. No abnormal results were found in pathological studies or behavioral observations. Thus, a rat model of NS-guided BPB was established, and BPB induced an overall reversible sensory and motor blockade in the thoracic limbs. Evaluation of the efficacy and safety demonstrated that this rat BPB model was feasible, reproducible, and safe.","Zhang, Yanzi; Cui, Bo; Gong, Chunyu; Tang, Yidan; Zhou, Jianxiong; He, Yi; Liu, Jin; Yang, Jing",Laboratory animals,281,1

Especially during operations in the area of the upper respiratory tract, there is a significantly increased risk of infection with COVID-19 for everyone present in the operating room. The aim of the study is to analyze the validity of SARS-CoV-2 swabs taken preoperatively under suboptimal conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective comparison of the PCR results of SARS-CoV-2 swaps taken preoperatively and intraoperatively from 62 children in the period from April to November 2020. Median age was 4.49 years. The PCR diagnosis was carried out one or two days preoperatively (in the case of emergency interventions on the same day) and again intraoperatively using a pooled nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS All 62 preoperatively taken swabs were negative. Deviating from the preoperative test result, one intraoperatively obtained swab was positive. CONCLUSIONS Due to limited compliance, a correct preoperative swab technique (preanalytics) cannot always be assumed for children. Sufficient protective measures for everyone present in the operating room are therefore imperative. Intraoperative test should be considered if the the preoperative test was performed under difficult conditions.","Zaubitzer, Lena; Ludwig, Sonja; Jungbauer, Frederic; Walter, Beatrice; Lange, Bettina; Rotter, Nicole; Schell, Angela",Laryngo- rhino- otologie,281,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten patients (11 procedures) underwent LESS through the umbilicus. Seven patients underwent nephrectomy and three patients underwent pyeloplasty (one simultaneous bilateral). R-port port (Advanced Surgical Concepts, Ireland) was used in nine cases, in one case, the Gelpoint access port (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, USA) was used. The Olympus Endoeye camera with coaxial light cable was used. The hilum was secured in all cases with Hem-o-Lok clips (Teleflex Medical, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) except in one case in which an Endo GIA stapler (Covidien Surgical, Norwalk, CT, USA) was used. RESULTS All procedures were technically successful. Accessory port (3 mm) was used in 3 patients. Mean age in nephrectomized patients was 3.14±1.7 years, the mean operative room time (ORT) was 97.5±12.54 minutes. In the pyeloplasty group, mean ORT was 192±47.16 minutes and mean age was 2.43±2.3 years. Bilateral pyeloplasty was done in a 4-month-old infant. The ORT in this case was 180 minutes. A follow-up renogram done in the pyeloplasty patients (n=2) showed good drainage. Mean length of stay was 3.6 days (range, 3 to 6 days).The analgesic requirement was 23.86 mg (range, 12.5 to 50 mg) of diclofenac sodium. CONCLUSIONS LESS is technically feasible in patients as young as 4 months of age. It has the potential to offer better cosmesis. This needs to be proved in further comparative studies. Development of miniature instruments will further the growth of LESS in this age group.","Ganpule, Arvind; Sheladiya, Chetan; Mishra, Shashikant; Sabnis, Ravindra; Desai, Mahesh",Korean journal of urology,281,26

We compared the impact of early versus late intubation on infection control and performance in a randomised in situ simulation, using fluorescent powder as a surrogate for contamination. Twenty anaesthetists and intensivists intubated a simulated patient with COVID-19. The primary outcome was the degree of contamination. The secondary outcomes included the use of bag-valve-mask ventilation, the incidence of manikin cough, intubation time, first attempt success and heart rate variability as a measure of stress. The contamination score was significantly increased in the late intubation group, mean (standard deviation, SD) 17.20 (6.17), 95% confidence intervals (CI) 12.80 to 21.62 versus the early intubation group, mean (SD) 9.90 (5.13), 95% CI 6.23 to 13.57, P = 0.005. The contamination score was increased after simulated cough occurrence (mean (SD) 18.0 (5.09) versus 5.50 (2.10) in those without cough; P<0.001), and when first attempt laryngoscopy failed (mean (SD) of 17.1 (6.41) versus 11.6 (6.20) P = 0.038). The incidence of bag-mask ventilation was higher in the late intubation group (80% versus 30%; P=0.035). There was no significant difference in intubation time, incidence of failed first attempt laryngoscopy or heart rate variability between the two groups. Late intubation in patients with COVID-19 may be associated with greater laryngoscopist contamination and potential aerosol-generating events compared with early intubation. There was no difference in performance measured by intubation time and incidence of first attempt success. Late intubation, especially when resources are limited, may be a valid approach. However, strict infection control and appropriate personal protective equipment usage is recommended in such cases.","Lee, Christopher P; Yip, Yu-Yeung; Chan, Albert Km; Ko, Chun P; Joynt, Gavin M",Anaesthesia and intensive care,281,1

PATIENT AND METHODS A 52-year-old male patient, who received intravesical BCG treatment for high-grade pT1 papillary urothelial carcinoma, presented 12 h after taking the fourth dose of induction therapy 38.2° fever and chills. The patient's reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test was positive, and Thorax CT imaging showed a few ground-glass pneumonic infiltrations in bilateral lung bases consistent with COVID-19 disease. RESULTS Although international urology associations have current recommendations regarding the pandemic process, only one study has made specific recommendations regarding the patient group diagnosed with COVID-19 while receiving intravesical BCG treatment. According to this recommendation, we interrupted our patient's BCG treatment for 3 weeks and then completed the treatment for 6 weeks. A maintenance treatment not exceeding 1 year was planned. CONCLUSION This group of patients' recommendation is to delay BCG therapy for at least 3 weeks after initial symptoms to allow for complete recovery. Although the administration schedule varies, maintenance therapy is recommended for no more than 1 year.","Ok, Fesih; Durmus, Emrullah",Urologia,281,1

Anemia and blood transfusions are associated with an increased risk of delirium. The aim of this research was to assess the effectiveness and safety of using IVIS in a prehabilitation program. MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients ≥70 y who underwent abdominal surgery between November 2015 and June 2018 were included in this single-center prospective cohort study. All patients were prehabilitated; however, only anemic patients received a single dose of 1000 mg intravenous iron (ferric carboxymaltose) to increase preoperative hemoglobin levels (IVIS group). Nonanemic patients received standard care (SC). The hemoglobin levels (primary outcome) were assessed at the outpatient clinic visit, at admission, and at discharge. Secondary outcomes were postoperative delirium, postoperative anemia, blood transfusion, complications other than delirium, and length of hospital stay. All outcomes were compared between the IVIS group and SC group. RESULTS Of all patients (n = 248), 97 anemic patients received IVIS (39%). Of the anemic patients, 50 patients (52%) had iron deficiency. Initial differences in hemoglobin concentrations between the IVIS group and SC group at T1 and T2 (7.2 versus 8.8; P < 0.001 and 7.4 versus 8.6; P = 0.023, respectively) were no longer present at discharge (6.6 versus 7.2; P = 0.35). No statistically significant differences were observed for all secondary outcomes between the IVIS group and the SC group. No infusion-related adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS Adding IVIS to prehabilitation programs is safe and diminishes differences in these concentrations between preoperatively anemic and nonanemic patients. IVIS may be worthwhile as an additional component of prehabilitation programs. Results merit further investigation.","Janssen, Ties L; Steyerberg, Ewout W; van Gammeren, Adriaan J; Ho, Gwan H; Gobardhan, Paul D; van der Laan, Lijckle",The Journal of surgical research,281,24

Endocrine professionals are involved in this battle, as far as many patients with endocrine co-morbidities (diabetes, metabolic syndrome, pituitary, thyroid, adrenal disorders) are most affected by the disease. Specific recommendations for the management of endocrine disorders were released by European experts. Most rely on the same principles of epidemiological safety measures, delaying non emergency admissions and transforming the routine follow-up in telemedicine clinics. Special attention is required to adrenal disorders, either central in the context of pituitary patients or primary. Corticosteroids are a mainstay of treatment in Covid-19 infection, therefore it is important to consider all aspects involved by high doses, including metabolic adverse reactions especially in diabetic patients. Other endocrine disorders, thyroid dysfunctions or nodules, parathyroid, adrenal, and pituitary diseases should follow specific recommendations for management. Surgery is postponed for non-emergency situations, restricting most planned surgeries, either thyroid, pituitary or adrenal. Laparoscopic surgery, if required in emergency, is including a supplementary risk, therefore all involved in the operating theater should wear PPE.

However, whether the combination of geldanamycin and licochalcone A-induced apoptosis in epithelial ovarian cancer cells is mediated by the formation of reactive oxygen species, leading to the activation of apoptotic caspase, has not been studied. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Using the human epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell lines OVCAR-3 and SK-OV-3, we investigated the promoting effect of licochalcone A on geldanamycin-induced apoptosis. RESULTS Geldanamycin induced changes in apoptosis-related protein levels, loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of cytochrome c, activation of caspases, cleavage of PARP-1, formation of reactive oxygen species and depletion of glutathione (GSH). Licochalcone A enhanced geldanamycin-induced apoptosis-related protein activation, formation of reactive oxygen species, caspase activation and cell death. The combined effect was inhibited by the addition of oxidant scavengers. CONCLUSIONS Licochalcone A may potentiate the apoptotic effect of geldanamycin on ovarian carcinoma cell lines by the activation of the caspase-8- and Bid-dependent pathways and the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. The apoptosis-promoting effect of licochalcone A may be mediated by its stimulatory action on the formation of reactive oxygen species and the depletion of GSH, which results in the activation of caspases.","Kim, Yun Jeong; Jung, Eun Byul; Myung, Soon Chul; Kim, Wonyong; Lee, Chung Soo",Pharmacology,281,14

BACKGROUND The trend in laparoscopic liver resection has been moving from limited resections toward major hepatectomy. The surgical techniques for laparoscopic major hepatectomy include pure laparoscopic, hand-assisted laparoscopic, and laparoscopy-assisted methods. We performed a literature search and systematic review to assess the current status of laparoscopic major hepatectomy. METHODS Our literature review was conducted in Medline using the keywords ""laparoscopy"" or ""laparoscopic"" combined with ""liver resection"" or ""hepatectomy."" Articles written in English containing more than 10 cases of laparoscopic major hepatectomy were selected. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Twenty-nine articles were selected for this review. The laparoscopic major hepatectomies achieved similar patient and economic outcomes compared with open liver resections in selected (noncirrhotic) patients. Surgeon experience with the techniques affected the results; thus, a learning period is mandatory. Of these 3 techniques, the pure laparoscopic method is suitable for experienced surgeons to achieve better cosmetic outcomes, whereas the hand-assisted laparoscopic method was associated with better perioperative outcomes; the laparoscopy-assisted method is used by surgeons for unique resections such as resection of cirrhotic livers, laparoscopic resection of tumors in unfavorable locations, and living donor hepatectomies. In addition, the laparoscopic major hepatectomy-specific, long-term oncologic outcomes remain to be addressed in future publications.","Lin, Niang-Cheng; Nitta, Hiroyuki; Wakabayashi, Go",Annals of surgery,281,6

RESULTS The propofol consumption in group III was significantly higher than in group I and II (P < 0.001). Spontaneous eye opening time was significantly longer in group III than in group I and II ( < 0.001). The patients in group III had significantly longer recovery times than patients in group I and II (P < 0.0001). Hypotension and bradycardia were not encountered during the study. The incidence of hypoxaemia was significantly greater in group III compared to other groups (P < 0.001). Pain control and endoscopist satisfaction was significantly better for group I and II than for group III (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Synergistic sedation can be achieved safely and effectively by the combination of propofol and IN sufentanil or IV midazolam for colonoscopy. However, IN sufentanil can be considered as a reasonable alternative to IV midazolam due to less respiratory depression, and better pain control and endoscopist satisfaction.","Akarsu Ayazoglu, Tulin; Uzman, Sinan",Anaesthesiology intensive therapy,281,19

Such feelings may have been increased by social distancing measures introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to investigate the effect of loneliness, social contact, and parent relationships on adolescent mental health during lockdown in the UK. Young people aged 11-16 years (n = 894) completed measures of loneliness, social contact, parent-adolescent relationships, and mental health difficulties during the first 11 weeks of lockdown and one-month later (n = 443). We examined cross-sectional associations and longitudinal relationships between loneliness, social contact, and parent relationships and subsequent mental health. Adolescents who reported higher loneliness had significantly higher symptoms of mental health difficulties during lockdown. We found that adolescents who had closer relationships with their parents reported significantly less severe symptoms of mental health difficulties and lower levels of loneliness. We also found that adolescents who spent more time texting others reported higher symptoms of mental health difficulties. Our hypothesis that loneliness would predict poorer mental health one month later was not supported. Time spent texting others at baseline was significantly associated with higher hyperactivity at follow-up, and closeness to parents was significantly associated with lower psychological distress at follow-up. We conclude that while loneliness was associated with greater mental health difficulties at baseline, it did not predict increased mental health difficulties one month later. Moreover, existing mental health problems significantly predicted later increase, thereby highlighting the importance of continuing support for vulnerable people.","Cooper, Kate; Hards, Emily; Moltrecht, Bettina; Reynolds, Shirley; Shum, Adrienne; McElroy, Eoin; Loades, Maria",Journal of affective disorders,281,1

DESIGN A case report (Canadian Task Force classification III). The local ethics committee waived the requirement for approval. SETTING A very small proportion of extragastrointestinal stromal tumors (EGISTs) is located in the retroperitoneal region. There are insufficient data on the clinical and pathologic features and the long-term follow-up of these tumors [1]. There are a few cases reported in the presacral region in the literature. The gold standard treatment for EGISTs is complete surgical excision of the mass. If it is possible, en bloc excision with its surrounding tissue is very important [2]. PATIENT A 53-year-old woman. The patient provided informed consent to use images and videos of the procedure. INTERVENTIONS This is a step-by-step illustration for resection of a retroperitoneal EGIST in the presacral area. The patient was a 53-year-old, gravida 3, para 3 white woman. She presented with abdominal pain for 5 months. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 4-cm diameter solid mass localized at the presacral area. Laboratory test results for tumor biomarkers were as follows: cancer antigen (CA) 125 = 40 U/mL (normal values <35 U/mL), CA 19-9 = 29 U/mL (normal values <37 U/mL), carcinoembryonic antigen = 2.1 ng/mL (normal values <3 ng/mL), and CA 15.3 = 18 U/mL (normal values <35 U/mL). Because of malignancy suspicion, gastroscopy and colonoscopy were performed and revealed no abnormality. The Papanicolaou smear and endometrial biopsy results were negative. After preparation of the patient, laparoscopy was performed. After placement of an 11-mm umbilical port and three 5-mm abdominal ports, the pelvis and abdomen were explored and revealed a 4-cm retroperitoneal mass in the presacral area. The peritoneum overlying the presacral mass was incised and the retroperitoneum explored. Given the proximity to the mass, left ureterolysis was performed. The mass was located on the left internal iliac vein and dissected carefully. The retroperitoneal attachments were resected, and the presacral mass was removed without any complications. In order not to widen the abdominal incisions, a posterior colpotomy was performed in the cul-de-sac at equal distances from the uterosacral ligaments. An Endobag (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) was introduced through the 5-mm port site at the posterior colpotomy. The specimen was removed in the Endobag through posterior colpotomy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The procedure was performed without any complications. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home on postoperative day 2. Pathology revealed a 4-cm retroperitoneal EGIST with negative margins. Immunohistochemistry measurements revealed hematoxylin-eosin; CD117; S100 positivity; and CD34, CD68, desmin, and DOG1 negativity. The cell type was mixed (spindle and epithelioid type). The mitotic rate was 1 to 2/50 high-power fields. The patient has been disease free since the completion of surgery. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic complete resection of the retroperitoneal EGIST in the presacral area is successfully performed in this patient. The patient presented by us is an example showing that minimally invasive procedures can be used in the treatment of this type of tumor in the presacral area. The key point in this operation is to control the relationship of vascular structures and a ureter with a tumor in every step to avoid any injury.","Sezgin, Burak; Camuzcuoğlu, Aysun; Camuzcuoğlu, Hakan",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,281,11

Although these bacteria are most commonly known for their role in industrial dairy fermentations, they are believed to have originally derived from natural plant-based habitats. These isolates with anti-Listeria activity were all found to carry the genes involved in the production of nisin, which is an approved food-grade preservative (E234).

Dental implant placement in this area may damage neurovascular branches if this anatomic variation is not carefully identified, resulting in unexpected complications. PURPOSE The purpose of this retrospective study was to identify accessory canals of the canalis sinuosus and analyze their relationship to the terminal canalis sinuosus and anterior maxilla in Chinese patients to provide a warning for surgeons operating in the anterior maxilla. MATERIAL AND METHODS Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans of 1007 Chinese patients were examined to identify the prevalence and size of accessory canals with at least 1.0-mm diameter. Axial position of this canal was classified referring to the nasal cavity and adjacent teeth. Its sagittal position was determined by the distance from the bifurcation site of canalis sinuosus to the buccal alveolar crest and the distance from the canal opening to the palatal alveolar crest. Diameter of the terminal canalis sinuosus, distance from the terminal canalis sinuosus to the buccal alveolar crest, and anterior maxillary volume were measured on all scans. Binary logistic regression and the Spearman rank correlation coefficient were used for prevalence and diameter analysis. RESULTS The prevalence of the accessory canal was 36.9%, positively correlated the anterior maxillary volume (OR 1.408) and negatively correlated with the distance from the terminal canalis sinuosus to the buccal alveolar crest (OR 0.921). Average diameter of such canal was 1.1 ±0.1 mm, significantly higher in men, positively correlated with the diameter of terminal canalis sinuosus (rs=0.163) and the distance from the canal opening to the palatal alveolar crest (rs=0.192). All accessory canals started below the buccal cortical bone, 19.3 ±2.7 mm away from the buccal alveolar crest. There were 61.9% accessory canals opened between the central and the lateral incisors. Openings here and in the central incisor region were closer to the alveolar crest than that between the lateral incisor and the canine (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS Accessory canals of the canalis sinuosus have high prevalence in the anterior maxilla in a Chinese population. Large anterior maxillary volume has been demonstrated as a risk factor associated with the presence of such canals. The region between the central and the lateral incisors was a predominant location. Openings in this region were closer to the alveolar crest than those between the lateral incisor and the canine.","Shan, Tiantian; Qu, Yang; Huang, Xiangya; Gu, Lisha",The Journal of prosthetic dentistry,281,26

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate efficacy of TDE in treating nontraumatic chylous effusions. METHODS A retrospective review of 34 patients was conducted assessing technical and clinical success of TDE for nontraumatic chylous effusions. RESULTS Thirty-four patients (mean age, 59 years; 27 female patients) with nontraumatic chylous effusions underwent TDE. Presentations included 21 unilateral chylothoraces (61.8%), nine bilateral chylothoraces (26.5%), two isolated chylopericardiums (5.9%), and two pleural effusions with chylopericardium (5.9%). TDE was technically successful in 24 of 34 patients (70.6%). The thoracic duct could not be catheterized in four of 34 (11.8%). Cisterna chyli was not visualized in six of 34 patients (17.6%), and, thus, TDE was not attempted. Follow-up was available for 32 patients. Four lymphangiographic patterns were observed: (1) normal thoracic duct in 17.6% of patients (six of 34), (2) occlusion of thoracic duct in 58.8% (20 of 34), (3) failure to opacify thoracic duct in 17.6% (six of 34), and (4) extravasation of chyle in 5.9% (two of 34). Clinical success varied with the lymphangiographic pattern. The clinical success rate was 16% (one of six) in cases of normal thoracic duct, 75% (15 of 20 patients) in occlusions of the thoracic duct, 16% (one of six) in cases of failure to opacify the thoracic duct, and 50% in two cases of chyle extravasation. Lymphangiography alone cured two patients (6.5%). CONCLUSION TDE was most successful in cases of thoracic duct occlusion and extravasation. Lymphangiography is important for identifying the cause of chylous effusions and selecting patients who benefit most from TDE.","Nadolski, Gregory J; Itkin, Maxim",Chest,281,30

However, the individual discrepancies of the current ""one-size-fits-all"" strategies for anticancer nanotherapeutics have heralded the need for ""personalized therapy"". Benefiting from the special inherency of various cells, diverse cell membrane-coated nanoparticles (CMCNs) were established on a patient-by-patient basis, which would facilitate the personalized treatment of individual cancer patients. CMCNs in a complex microenvironment can evade the immune system and target homologous tumors with a suppressed immune response, as well as a prolonged circulation time, consequently increasing the drug accumulation at the tumor site and anticancer therapeutic efficacy. This review focuses on the emerging strategies and advances of CMCNs to synergistically integrate the merit of source cells with nanoparticulate delivery systems for the orchestration of personalized anticancer nanotherapeutics, thus discussing their rationalities in facilitating chemotherapy, imaging, immunotherapy, phototherapy, radiotherapy, sonodynamic, magnetocaloric, chemodynamic and gene therapy. Furthermore, the mechanism, challenges and opportunities of CMCNs in personalized anticancer therapy were highlighted to further boost cooperation from different fields, including materials science, chemistry, medicine, pharmacy and biology for the lab-to-clinic translation of CMCNs combined with the individual advantages of source cells and nanotherapeutics.","Chen, Xuerui; Liu, Bingbing; Tong, Rongliang; Zhan, Lin; Yin, Xuelian; Luo, Xin; Huang, Yanan; Zhang, Junfeng; He, Wen; Wang, Yanli",Biomaterials science,281,20

We undertook a systematic review to investigate the effectiveness of the collaborative care model for depression for LEP patients in primary care. METHODS We queried online PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL and EMBASE databases (January 1, 2000, to June 10, 2017) for quantitative studies comparing collaborative care to usual care to treat depression in adults with LEP in primary care. We evaluated the impact of collaborative care on depressive symptoms or on depression treatment. Two reviewers independently extracted key data from the studies and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane bias and quality assessment tool (RCTs) and the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (non-RCTs). RESULTS Of 86 titles identified, 15 were included (representing 9 studies: 5 RCTs, 3 cohort studies, and 1 case-control study). Studies included 4859 participants; 2679 (55%) reported LEP. The majority spoke Spanish (93%). The wide variability in study design and outcome definitions precluded performing a meta-analysis. Follow-up ranged from 3 months to 2 years. Three of four high-quality RCTs reported that 13-25% more patients had improved depressive symptoms when treated with culturally tailored collaborative care compared to usual care; the last had high treatment in the control arm and found equal improvement. Two non-RCT studies suggest that Spanish-speaking patients may benefit as much as, if not more than, English-speaking patients treated with collaborative care. The remaining studies reported increased receipt of preferred depression treatment (therapy vs. antidepressants) in the intervention groups. Eight of nine studies used bilingual providers to deliver the intervention. DISCUSSION While limited by the number and variability of studies, the available research suggests that collaborative care for depression delivered by bilingual providers may be more effective than usual care among patients with LEP.

Researchers have long grappled with this question, and studies have returned equivocal results.

We tested our hypothesis in two meta-analyses. The first involved the raw data of 40 samples from 23 social-dilemma studies with 8,123 participants. Findings provided strong support for our perspective. Whereas we found that the two sexes do not differ in average cooperation levels, men are much more likely to behave either selfishly or altruistically, whereas women are more likely to be moderately cooperative. We confirmed our findings in a second meta-analytic study of 28 samples from 23 studies of organizational citizenship behavior with 13,985 participants.

Here we analyzed the activity of JNK inhibitors on influenza A virus (IAV) amplification. Human lung epithelial cells were infected with either the highly pathogenic avian virus strain A/FPV/Bratislava/79 (H7N7) or the pandemic swine-origin influenza virus A/Hamburg/4/09 (H1N1v). The application of the JNK inhibitors SP600125 and AS601245 reduced IAV amplification by suppressing viral protein and RNA synthesis. Although AS601245 appeared to generally block the transcription of newly introduced genes, SP600125 specifically affected viral RNA synthesis. Overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of SEK/MKK4 and siRNA-mediated suppression of JNK2 expression confirmed that specific manipulation of the JNK pathway attenuates virus propagation. An IAV minigenome replication assay revealed that SP600125 did not directly affect the activity of the viral RNA polymerase complex but seems to suppress an anti-influenza nonstructural protein 1-mediated virus supportive function. Finally, when H7N7- or H1N1v-infected mice were treated with SP600125, the viral load is reduced in lungs of treated compared with untreated mice. Our data suggest that this class of ATP competitive inhibitors once optimized for antiviral action potentially represent novel drugs for antiviral intervention.","Nacken, Wolfgang; Ehrhardt, Christina; Ludwig, Stephan",Biological chemistry,281,26

Accordingly, a preliminary report of our experience of suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infections in children was published without microbiological findings. This report provides an update on pediatric severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infections in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, that includes microbiological findings. METHODS All of the children admitted to the Hospital for Sick Children between March 14 and June 15, 2003, with suspect severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infection were included. A proven case was defined as one that fulfilled the clinical criteria for suspect severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infection and demonstrated a serologic response to severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. Serology results, from a neutralizing antibody assay, were considered positive if the sera inhibited the development of a severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-specific cytopathic effect at a dilution of > or =1:8. RESULTS Neutralizing antibody to severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus was demonstrated in 8 of 25 children admitted with suspect severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infection. In 3 of these 8 children, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus was also detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in the stool. All 8 had documented exposure to > or =1 severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-infected adults residing in the same household. Exposure that was limited to visiting a Toronto hospital at which severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus-infected patients were admitted or travel from a country in which severe acute respiratory syndrome had been reported did not result in documented infection in any of our cases. On the basis of our clinical case definition, 6 of 8 microbiologically confirmed case had been classified as having probable severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infection. Clinical disease was mild, nonspecific, and self-limited and was indistinguishable from that reported with other common respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS The factor most strongly associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infection in Toronto children was a history of close contact with an adult severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus case. This serves to reinforce the importance of routinely obtaining a thorough epidemiologic travel and exposure history for all subjects with suspected infectious diseases.","Bitnun, Ari; Read, Stanley; Tellier, Raymond; Petric, Martin; Richardson, Susan E",Pediatrics,281,1

In MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands), the choice of the type of thrombectomy device was left to the discretion of the interventionist. The aim of this study was to explore the differences in functional outcome, neurological recovery, reperfusion, extent of infarction, and adverse events according to stent type and make. METHODS The primary outcome was functional outcome at 90 days, assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Neuroimaging outcomes included occlusion on computed tomographic angiography at 24 hours, infarct volume at 5 to 7 days, and modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction scores. Safety outcomes included death within 90 days and any symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. We analyzed possible interactions between stent type and treatment with multiple regression models. Treatment effects were adjusted for patient age, stroke severity, and collateral score. RESULTS Of the 500 patients included in the trial, 233 were allocated to intervention. Of these, 124 (53%) were first treated with Trevo (adjusted common odds ratio for shift on the mRS [acOR, 1.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-2.92]), 31 (13%) with Solitaire (acOR, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-3.73), 40 (17%) with other retrievable stents or mechanical devices (acOR, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.51-3.93], and 38 (16%) could not be treated. There was no interaction between device and treatment effect on functional outcome and all other secondary and safety outcomes.

A previous study has reported that viperin could limit hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in vitro. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In the present study, we found that overexpression of viperin could inhibit HCV replication in a dose-dependent manner in both the replicon and HCVcc systems. Furthermore, through co-immunoprecipitation and laser confocal microscopic analysis, viperin was found to interact with the host protein hVAP-33. Mutagenesis analysis demonstrated that the anti-HCV activity of viperin was located to its C terminus, which was required for the interaction with the C-terminal domain of hVAP-33. Competitive co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that viperin could interact competitively with hVAP-33, and could therefore interfere with its interactions with HCV NS5A. In summary, these findings suggest a novel mechanism by which viperin inhibits HCV replication, possibly through binding to host protein hVAP-33 and interfering with its interaction with NS5A.","Wang, Shanshan; Wu, Xianfang; Pan, Tingting; Song, Wuhui; Wang, Yaohui; Zhang, Fei; Yuan, Zhenghong",The Journal of general virology,281,1

Protein detection systems ranging from widely used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to simple, inexpensive approaches, such as lateral flow immunoassays, play critical roles in medical and drug research. Despite continuous progress, current systems are insufficient for the diagnosis of diseases that require high sensitivity. In this study, we developed a heterogeneous sandwich-type sensing platform based on recombinase polymerase amplification using DNA aptamers specific to the target biomarker. Only the DNA bound to the target in the form of a heterogeneous sandwich was selectively amplified, and the fluorescence signal of an intercalating dye added before the amplification reaction was detected, thereby enabling high specificity and sensitivity. We applied this method for the detection of protein biomarkers for various infectious diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and observed attomolar-level detection of biomarkers and low cross-reactivity between different viruses. We also confirmed detection efficiency of the proposed method using clinical samples. These results demonstrate that the proposed sensing platform can be used to diagnose various diseases requiring high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.","Kang, Juyoung; Jang, Hyungjun; Yeom, Gyuho; Kim, Min-Gon",Analytical chemistry,281,16

METHODS In this work, we have performed an in silico design and prediction of potential siRNAs based on genetic diversity and recombination patterns, targeting various genes of SARS-CoV-2 for antiviral therapeutics. We performed extensive sequence analysis to analyze the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships, and to identify the possible source of virus reservoirs and recombination patterns, and the evolution of the virus as well as we designed the siRNAs which can be used as antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS The sequence analysis and phylogenetic relationships indicated high sequence identity and closed clusters with many types of coronavirus. In our analysis, the full-genome of SARS-CoV-2 showed the highest sequence (nucleotide) identity with SARS-bat-ZC45 (87.7%). The overall sequence identity ranged from 74.3% to 87.7% with selected SARS viruses. The recombination analysis indicated the bat SARS virus is a potential recombinant and serves as a major and minor parent. We have predicted 442 siRNAs and finally selected only 19 functional, and potential siRNAs. CONCLUSIONS The siRNAs were predicted and selected based on their greater potency and specificity. The predicted siRNAs need to be validated experimentally for their effective binding and antiviral activity.","Sohrab, Sayed Sartaj; Aly El-Kafrawy, Sherif; Abbas, Aymn T; Bajrai, Leena H; Azhar, Esam Ibraheem",Current pharmaceutical design,281,24

OBJECTIVE To demonstrate the feasibility, reliability, and value of remote visits in a phase III clinical trial of individuals with Parkinson's disease. METHODS We invited individuals with Parkinson's disease enrolled in a phase III clinical trial (STEADY-PD III) to enroll in a sub-study of remote video-based visits. Participants completed three remote visits over one year within four weeks of an in-person visit and completed assessments performed during the remote visit. We evaluated the ability to complete scheduled assessments remotely; agreement between remote and in-person outcome measures; and opinions of remote visits. RESULTS We enrolled 40 participants (mean (SD) age 64.3 (10.4), 29% women), and 38 (95%) completed all remote visits. There was excellent correlation (ICC 0.81-0.87) between remote and in-person patient-reported outcomes, and moderate correlation (ICC 0.43-0.51) between remote and in-person motor assessments. On average, remote visits took around one quarter of the time of in-person visits (54 vs 190 minutes). Nearly all participants liked remote visits, and three-quarters said they would be more likely to participate in future trials if some visits could be conducted remotely. CONCLUSION Remote visits are feasible and reliable in a phase III clinical trial of individuals with early, untreated Parkinson's disease. These visits are shorter, reduce participant burden, and enable safe conduct of research visits, which is especially important in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tarolli, Christopher G; Andrzejewski, Kelly; Zimmerman, Grace A; Bull, Michael; Goldenthal, Steven; Auinger, Peggy; O'Brien, Michael; Dorsey, E Ray; Biglan, Kevin; Simuni, Tanya",Journal of Parkinson's disease,281,29

The isolation and social distancing, the increased fear of being infected or infecting others and the insecurity generated by the economic impact, could contribute to an increase in the incidence of mental health issues, such as psychotic disorders.ObjectivesThe aim is to discuss four clinical cases in order to provide further evidence on this matter.MethodsWe report on three females and one male with no personal psychiatric history who were admitted to a tertiary hospital during the first three months after the declaration of the pandemic. The average age was 44,25 ± 14,97 years.ResultsAll patients met the International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria for acute and transient psychotic disorder. All of the episodes were triggered by the stress generated from the COVID-19. Complementary tests were unremarkable. They all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Rapid discharge with favorable response to relatively low doses of antipsychotics was possible with a mean length of stay of 7,25 ± 2,86 days. In two of the cases the delirious content was predominantly marked by the coronavirus itself.ConclusionsIt has been suggested that the intense psychosocial stress associated with a new life-threatening disease and national lockdown restrictions could be triggers for new-onset psychotic disorders. Some authors have reported cases similar to ours, which means that we could be experiencing and increase in the incidence of psychotic disorders due to the exceptional circumstances we are living around the world.","Pérez-Balaguer, A.; Solari-Heresmann, L.

However, it is less clear how GRNs encode cellular responses to everyday microenvironmental cues. Macrophages can be polarized and potentially repolarized based on environmental signaling. In order to identify the GRNs that drive macrophage polarization and the heterogeneous single-cell subpopulations that are present in the process, we used a high-resolution time course of bulk and single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq assays of HL-60-derived macrophages polarized towards M1 or M2 over 24 hours. We identified transient M1 and M2 markers, including the main transcription factors that underlie polarization, and subpopulations of naive, transitional, and terminally polarized macrophages. We built bulk and single-cell polarization GRNs to compare the recovered interactions and found that each technology recovered only a subset of known interactions. Our data provide a resource to study the GRN of cellular maturation in response to microenvironmental stimuli in a variety of contexts in homeostasis and disease.","Carvalho, Klebea; Rebboah, Elisabeth; Jansen, Camden; Williams, Katherine; Dowey, Andrew; McGill, Cassandra; Mortazavi, Ali",bioRxiv,281,33

Here, profiling the spectrum of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) as a model, we identify the blood platelet transcriptome as a proxy for highly sensitive progression biomarkers that also enables prediction of advanced disease via machine learning algorithms. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we derive disease-relevant gene expression in purified platelets from 120 peripheral blood samples constituting two time-separated cohorts of patients diagnosed with one of three MPN subtypes at sample acquisition – essential thrombocythemia, ET (n=24), polycythemia vera, PV (n=33), and primary or post ET/PV secondary myelofibrosis, MF (n=42), and healthy donors (n=21). The MPN platelet transcriptome reveals an incremental molecular reprogramming that is independent of patient driver mutation status or therapy and discriminates each clinical phenotype. Leveraging this dataset that shows a characteristic progressive expression gradient across MPN, we develop a machine learning model (Lasso-penalized regression) and predict advanced subtype MF at high accuracy and under two conditions of external validation: i) temporal: our two Stanford cohorts, AUC-ROC of 0.96; and ii) geographical: independently published data of an additional n=25 MF and n=46 healthy donors, AUC-ROC of 0.97). Lasso-derived signatures offer a robust core set of < 5 MPN transcriptome markers that are progressive in expression. Mechanistic insights from our data highlight impaired protein homeostasis as a prominent driver of MPN evolution, with persistent integrated stress response. We also identify JAK inhibitor-specific signatures and other interferon, proliferation, and proteostasis-associated markers as putative targets for MPN-directed therapy. Our platelet transcriptome snapshot of chronic MPNs demonstrates a proof of principle for disease risk stratification and progression beyond genetic data alone, with potential utility in other progressive disorders. Highlights Leveraging two independent and mutually validating MPN patient cohorts, we identify progressive transcriptomic markers that also enable externally validated prediction in MPNs. Our platelet RNA-Seq data identifies impaired protein homeostasis as prominent in MPN progression and offers putative targets of therapy.

Comparatively, Sweden applied the herd immunity model. The aim of this study is to analyze the Swedish model compared to the lockdown model based in other countries to understand the impact of these models on public health, health economics and overall economy of the respective countries. Based on the findings, the paper aims to shed light on which model proves to be more effective to cope with the pandemic and provide recommendations for other countries to follow accordingly. Our methodology was a narrative review that synthesizes current literature obtained from searches on various databases, authoritative texts, and hand searches. While it is too early to determine the long term effects of both models, it seems that Sweden's herd immunity model is more effective considering aspects of overall public health, health economic factors, and the overall economy. The major cons of the Swedish model was a failure in controlling infection spread in elderly nursing homes, as half the death toll comprises individuals belonging to this community. While Sweden was able to soften the effect of COVID-19 impact on its economy without a lockdown, the manufacturing industry was impacted due to lack of availability of required parts to be supplied by other countries. Thus from our review, we found that Herd-immunity model is more effective, but it depends on other factors of the country such as population density, as it is not plausible for countries such as Spain, the US or Germany, which need to expose high numbers of people to COVID-19 to attain herd immunity.","Turkistani, F.; Bin Sawad, A.",International Journal of Life Science and Pharma Research,281,1

In this regard, this study aims to develop a multi-criteria decision support system considering the sustainability, feasibility, and success rate of possible approaches. Therefore, two models have been developed: Geo-AHP (applying geo-based data) and BN-Geo-AHP using probabilistic techniques (Bayesian network). The ranking method of Geo-APH is generalized, and the equations are provided in a way that adding new elements and variables would be possible by experts. Then, to improve the ranking, the application of the probabilistic technique of a Bayesian network and the role of machine learning for database and weight of each parameter are explained, and the model of BN-Geo-APH has been developed. In the next step, to show the application of the developed Geo-AHP and BN-Geo-AHP models, we selected the new pandemic of COVID-19 that affected nearly all activities, and we used both models for analysis. For this purpose, we first analyzed the available data about COVID-19 and previous studies about similar virus infections, and then we ranked the main approaches and alternatives in confronting the pandemic of COVID-19. The analysis of approaches with the selected alternatives shows the first ranked approach is massive vaccination and the second ranked is massive swabs or other tests. The third is the use of medical masks and gloves, and the last ranked is the lockdown, mostly due to its major negative impact on the economy and individuals.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a Machine Learning algorithm that has been performing well in detecting many diseases including Coronary Artery Disease, Malaria, Alzheimer’s disease, different dental diseases, and Parkinson’s disease. Like other cases, CNN has a substantial prospect in detecting COVID-19 patients with medical images like chest X-rays and CTs. Detecting Corona positive patients is very important in preventing the spread of this virus. On this conquest, a CNN model is proposed to detect COVID-19 patients from chest X-ray images. Two CNN models with different number of convolution layers and three other models based on ResNet50, VGG-16 and VGG-19 are evaluated with comparative analytical analysis. The proposed model performs with an accuracy of 97.5% and a precision of 97.5%. This model gives the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve area of 0.975 and F1-score of 97.5. It can be improved further by increasing the dataset for training the model. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Haque, K.

This study intends to explore the use of mobile banking services to accelerate people's financial access in Bangladesh due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic by using secondary data. Mainly documentation techniques and descriptive statistical methods are used to collect and analyze the data. The study reveals that the number of registered mobile banking customers has escalated during the COVID-19 era. Mainly government policies regarding different mobile banking transactions such as cash in, cash out, person to person (P2P) transaction, salary and utility bill payments etc., have significantly contributed to rise the people's digital financial access during this pandemic. People's changing habit towards digital transactions has also contributed to increasing their financial access.

Recently, reports of dermatological findings associated with COVID-19 such as urticaria has been increasing. Here, a COVID-19 case presenting with urticaria and angioedema is described. A 26-year-old female patient, who was found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive by polymerase chain reaction performed for being in contact, presented to our outpatient clinic with complaints of itchy, erythematous lesions on her body and swelling in the eyes and throat for four days. The patient received favipiravir treatment for 5 days and these complaints started 4 days after the treatment ended. History of food and other drug allergies, insect bites and chemicals were questioned in the differential diagnosis for etiology, however, no relationship was detected. Systemic corticosteroid and antihistamine treatment was initiated, and edema in the eyes completely regressed and urticaria plaques faded on the 3rd day of the treatment. Dermatological findings may occur simultaneously with the classic symptoms of the disease or before or after symptoms. Although the pathogenesis between dermatological findings and COVID-19 has not been fully elucidated, studies have suggested that viral infections and SARS-CoV-2 can be an etiological agent for chronic or acute urticaria. It is thought that some rashes may be causally related to the viral effect and others to the immune response. It is emphasized that there may be atypical findings such as urticaria/angioedema in order to diagnose COVID-19 disease early and prevent its spread and should be considered in differential diagnosis.","Akkus, I.; Kaygusuz, S.",Flora,281,15

Few have looked into the issue that gastrointestinal (GI) procedures may produce an abundance of aerosols. The current process of risk management for clinics is to follow a clinic-specific HVAC formula, which is typically calculated once-a-year and assume perfect mixing of the air within the space, to determine how many minutes each procedural room refreshes 99% of its air between procedures when doors are closed. This formula is not designed to fit the complex dynamic of small airborne particle transport and deposition that can potentially carry the virus in clinical conditions. It results in reduced procedure throughput as well as an excess of idle time in clinics that process a large number of short procedures such as outpatient GI centers. We present and tested a new cyber-physical system that continuously monitors airborne particle counts in procedural rooms and also at the same time it automatically monitors the procedural rooms' state and flexible endoscope status without interfering with the clinic's workflow. We use our data gathered from over 1500 GI cases in one clinical suite to understand the correlation between air quality and standard procedure types as well as identify the risks involved with any HVAC system in a clinical suite environment. Thanks to this system, we demonstrate that standard GI procedures generate large quantities of aerosols, which can potentially promote viral airborne transmission among patients and healthcare staff. We provide a solution for the clinic to improve procedure turnover times and throughput, as well as to mitigate the risk of airborne transmission of the virus.","Garbey, M.; Joerger, G.; Furr, S.",,281,33

Prior work shows late LTP (L-LTP), lasting three or more hours, first occurs at postnatal day 12 (P12) in Long-Evans rat hippocampus. The goal of the current work was to determine the developmental onset of L-LTP in mouse hippocampus as a basis for comparing potential effects of key genetic manipulations known to affect dendritic spine structure. Four mouse strains were tested. Both C57BL/6 and Fmr1−/y mice on the C57BL/6 background began to show reliable L-LTP at P35. In contrast, both 129SVE wild type and Hevin−/− (Sparcl1−/−) on the 129SVE background first showed reliable L-LTP at P28. All strains showed a gradual progression between P10 to P28 in success rate for short-term potentiation (STP), which lasts one hour or less. At P10 in rats, two episodes of TBS result in L-LTP when the time between episodes was ≥ 90 minutes. In mice, multiple bouts of TBS at various inter-bout intervals did not advance the onset age of L-LTP. Prior work in rats showed the onset of L-LTP at P12 coincided with the first formation of dendritic spines. In contrast, hippocampal dendritic spines are present by P24 in C57BL/6 mice, well before the onset age for L-LTP. These species-dependent findings suggest that dendritic spines may be necessary but not sufficient for L-LTP. KEY POINTS SUMMARY Saturating theta-burst stimulation (TBS) was used to discern the developmental age when short-term potentiation (STP) lasting 1 hour and late long-term potentiation (L-LTP) lasting ≥3 hr are first expressed in mouse hippocampus. Four mouse strains were compared—C57BL/6 and Fmr1−/y on C57BL/6 background and 129SVE and Hevin−/− (Sparcl1−/−) on 129SVE background—because both gene manipulations alter dendritic spines. In all four strains, STP onset was gradual, first occurring between postnatal days (P) 10-28, while reliable L-LTP emerged in C57BL/6 and Fmr1−/y at P35, and in 129SVE and Hevin−/− (Sparcl1−/−) at P28. In contrast to rat hippocampus, multiple episodes of TBS did not alter the onset age of L-LTP in mouse hippocampus. The L-LTP onset age in rat hippocampus is P12, coincident with the first appearance of dendritic spines. Others report spine appearance by P24 in mouse hippocampus, suggesting spines may be necessary but not sufficient for L-LTP.","Ostrovskaya, Olga I.; Cao, Guan; Eroglu, Cagla; Harris, Kristen M.",bioRxiv,281,1

Using mechanistic mathematical models, we show how simple manipulations to population structure can exogenously impose Darwinian-like properties on communities. Such scaffolding causes communities to participate directly in the process of evolution by natural selection and drives the evolution of cell-level interactions to the point where, despite underlying stochasticity, derived communities give rise to offspring communities that faithfully re-establish parental phenotype. The mechanism is akin to a developmental process (developmental correction) that arises from density dependent interactions among cells. Knowledge of ecological factors affecting evolution of developmental correction has implications for understanding the evolutionary origin of major egalitarian transitions, symbioses, and for top-down engineering of microbial communities.","Doulcier, Guilhem; Lambert, Amaury; De Monte, Silvia; Rainey, Paul B.",bioRxiv,281,23

As such, an aggressive initial innate immune response favors the host in contrast to a detrimental prolonged inflammation. The complement pathway bridges innate and adaptive immune system and contributes to the response by directly clearing pathogens or infected cells, as well as recruiting proinflammatory immune cells and regulating inflammation. However, the impact of modulating complement activation in viral infections is still unclear. In this work, we targeted the complement decay-accelerating factor (DAF/CD55), a surface protein that protects cells from non-specific complement attack, and analyzed its role in IAV infections. We found that DAF modulates IAV infection in vivo, via an interplay with the antigenic viral proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), in a strain specific manner. Our results reveal that, contrary to what could be expected, DAF potentiates complement activation, increasing the recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes and T cells. We also show that viral NA acts on the heavily sialylated DAF and propose that it exacerbates complement activation, leading to lung immunopathology. Remarkably, this mechanism has no impact on viral loads but rather on the host resilience to infection and may have direct implications in zoonotic influenza transmissions. Author summary Exacerbated complement activation and immune deregulation are at the basis of several pathologies induced by respiratory viruses. Here, we report that complement decay-accelerating factor (DAF), which inhibits complement activation in healthy cells, increases disease severity upon Influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Remarkably, DAF interaction with IAV proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), resulted in excessive complement activation and recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells, without affecting viral loads. Furthermore, we observed that viral NA directly cleaves DAF and promotes complement activation, providing a possible link between IAV-DAF interaction and pathology. Therefore, our results unveil a novel pathway that could modulate disease severity, which may help to understand the increased pathogenicity of zoonotic and pandemic IAV infections.","Santos, Nuno Brito; Vaz da Silva, Zoé Enderlin; Gomes, Catarina; Reis, Celso A.; Amorim, Maria João",bioRxiv,281,28

Fear of an incursion of an unknown or incompletely understood threat can significantly limit risk tolerance. The fear may be that an incursion will affect export trade or tourism. An incomplete knowledge of the animal health situation in the exporting country, due to insufficient surveillance for the disease agent of concern, may limit the application of science in import decisions.

In response to local patient feedback, we introduced a single hospital visit laparoscopic hernia surgery pathway with focus on informed consent, patient-reported outcomes and post-operative interaction with primary care services. METHODS A single hospital visit service for elective hernia repairs was created. Patients were not excluded on age, BMI or co-morbidity. Following referral, patients were telephoned by a surgeon. If considered appropriate, a symptom assessment tool, procedure information and consent form were sent. All patients were operated without attending clinic or pre-operative assessment. Surgeon-led telephone follow-up was made at either 2 or 7 days post-operatively and patient satisfaction assessed at 3 months. RESULTS A total of 517 patients were referred for single-stop surgery between 2012 and 2015. Median age was 58 (range 20-92), 91 % were male, and mean BMI was 25.6 (17.4-52.0). No patient refused the single-visit pathway. Single-stop patients had higher knowledge questionnaire scores (mean 16 vs. 10, p = 0.01) than patients who had attended clinic. Nine (1.7 %) were requested to attend clinic to confirm diagnosis, and three (0.8 %) were cancelled by their surgeon on the operative day. A total of 393 hernia repairs (331 TEP, 63 open) were performed under general anaesthetic. 92 % were discharged on day zero. Telephone follow-up day two rather than seven decreased attendance to primary care services (25 % vs. 57 %, p = 0.001). At 3 months, 95 % were satisfied and symptom scores were reduced (median 5-0, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION Single-visit surgery appears to extend the patient benefits of laparoscopy by reducing hospital visits without compromising safety. Single hospital visit hernia surgery for unselected primary care referrals is possible and acceptable to patients.","Carty, N J; Curtis, N J; Ranaboldo, C J",Surgical endoscopy,281,1

D-RNAs in which replicase gene 1b-derived sequences had been removed or replaced with all the downstream genes were replicated well but were rescued poorly, suggesting inefficient packaging. However, no specific part of the 1b gene was required for efficient packaging.","Dalton, K; Casais, R; Shaw, K; Stirrups, K; Evans, S; Britton, P; Brown, T D; Cavanagh, D",Journal of virology,281,20

The sampling designs used are often biased in that they do not reflect the true underlying populations. For instance, individuals with strong symptoms are more likely to be tested than those with no symptoms. This results in biased estimates of prevalence (too high) and over-estimation of fatality rates. Typical post-sampling corrections are not always possible. Here we present a simple bias correction methodology derived and adapted from a correction for publication bias in meta analysis studies. The methodology is general enough to allow a wide variety of customization making it more useful in practice. Implementation is easily done using already collected information. We show via an example that the bias corrections can provide dramatic reductions in estimation error.","Díaz-Pachón, Daniel Andrés; Rao, J Sunil",ArXiv,281,26

We examined 1012 unselected stool specimens from 799 children for various pathogens, including Aeromonas spp., to evaluate the clinical associations of Aeromonas spp. in the stools of children in the East End of London. A total of 33 children had positive cultures for Aeromonas spp. These were identified as: Aeromonas hydrophila (16), A. sobria (9), A. caviae (8). Aeromonas spp. were identified by being oxidase positive in character, a property that distinguishes Aeromonas spp. from Enterobacteriaceae. Associated pathogens included Salmonella typhimurium (1), Campylobacter spp. (3), Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (2), and Giardia lamblia (1). Electron microscopic examination of the stool of 13 children revealed viral particles in two, rotavirus (1), and coronavirus-like particles (1). The associated clinical features in the 25 children with only Aeromonas excretion were diarrhea (21), vomiting (10), abdominal pain (9), fever (4), and mild dehydration (2).

METHODS: Three IgG serological assays (Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, and MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG) were initially evaluated by analyzing 42 samples from confirmed COVID-19-recovered patients and 48 negative individuals. A total of 1678 HCW (~30% of all hospital employees) were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG with the Abbott assay, run on Abbott Architect i2000SR. The samples exceeding the predefined cut-off (1.4 S/C) were reanalyzed with the Elecsys, MAGLUMI, and VIDAS SARS-COV-2 IgG assays. RESULTS: Initially, the MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG produced 26.2% false negatives and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 produced one false positive. Among 1678 HCW, the Abbott assay showed only 10 (0.6%) positive results, with mostly mildly elevated signals. Nine of these samples were non-reactive when they were retested with the Elecsys, MAGLUMI, and VIDAS assays. As for the one remaining sample, it was positive when tested with the Elecsys assay, while the other two assays yielded negative results. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence among asymptomatic HCW in our hospital setting was low, with different assays indicating a different number of positive samples. One of the assays yielded a large false negative rate. These findings can be attributed to differences in assay formulation but also to heterogeneity and diverse reactivity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens.","Lapic, Ivana; Rogic, Dunja; Segulja, Dragana; Kralik Oguic, Sasa; Knezevic, Josip",Croat Med J,281,16

This pandemic, like previous viral outbreaks, has resulted in spikes in anxiety, depression, and stress. Even though millions of individuals face the physical health consequences of infection by COVID-19, even more individuals are confronted with the mental health consequences of this pandemic. This significantly increased demand for mental health services cannot be easily met by existing mental health systems, which often rely on courses of therapy to be delivered over months. Single session interventions (SSIs) may be one important approach to meeting this increased demand, as they are treatments designed to be delivered over the course of a single meeting. SSIs have been found to be effective for a range of mental health challenges, with durable effects lasting months to years later. Here, we describe an SSI designed for the COVID-19 pandemic. This Brief Assessment-informed Skills Intervention for COVID-19 (BASIC) program draws upon therapeutic skills from existing empirically supported treatments to target common presenting complaints due to this pandemic. We discuss the process of developing and implementing this intervention, as well as explore feasibility and initial clinical insights. In short, BASIC is an easy-to-adopt intervention that is designed to be effective in a single session, making it well-suited for handling the increased demand for mental health services due to COVID-19.","Hsu, Kean J; Carl, Emily; DiVita, Annabelle; Feldman, Talya; Alban Foulser, Anna; Freihart, Bridget; Madole, James; McNamara, Mary E; Rubin, Mikael; Stein, Aliza T; Tretyak, Valeria; Smits, Jasper A J",,281,24

Therefore, effective containment measures should achieve a negative epidemicity index.

According to the WHO reports, total 3 862 676 positive cases and 265 961 deaths have been recorded worldwide due to COVID-19 infection as of May 9, 2020. CoVs are a large family of viruses (enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses), which includes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). New SARS CoV2 is the members of Betacoronavirus genus. These viruses cause infections in bats, camels and humans, and a few other associated species. Despite many neurologic complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is still unclear whether these symptoms results from direct neural injury or due to some other reason. Currently, it appears that most of the neurological symptoms of COVID-19 are nonspecific and secondary to the systemic illness. A single case of acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy has been reported. SARS-CoV-2 associated Guillain-Barré syndrome is an atypical case. Till today, no convincing evidence is available to confirm that the SARS-CoV-2 virus directly affects nerves system in humans. However, postinfection surveillance will be necessary to identify the possible post-COVID-19 neurologic syndromes.","Singh, Anurag Kumar; Bhushan, Bharat; Maurya, Anand; Mishra, Gaurav; Singh, Santosh Kumar; Awasthi, Rajendra",Dermatol Ther,281,1

BACKGROUND: In response to the public health measures in Hawaii to curtail the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, Hawaii Pacific Neuroscience (HPN) adapted their patient care to ensure continuity of neurological treatment. METHODS: The telephone survey was conducted on patients seen at HPN during the period of April 22, 2020-May 18, 2020 to address four areas related to patients' outpatient experience: delivery of care, general well-being, experience with telemedicine, and disease-specific questions. RESULTS: A total of 928 patients were contacted of which 429 (46.2%) patients responded and 367 (85.5%) agreed to participate. A total of 133 patients with migraine and 234 patients with other neurological conditions provided responses. Our migraine patients' survey responses suggest that their well-being was disproportionately negatively affected by the pandemic. Survey respondents with migraine were significantly more likely than their non-migraine peers to report worsening anxiety and sleep problems [62/132 (47.0%) vs. 78/234 (33.3%), &#967;2 = 6.64, p = 0.010, and 64/132 (48.5%) vs. 73/234 (31.2%), &#967;2 = 10.77, p = 0.001]; migraine patients also reported worsening of depression as a result of the pandemic more than patients with other diagnoses, though this was not statistically significant [44/132 (33.3%) vs. 57/234 (24.4%), &#967;2 = 3.40, p = 0.065]. In regard to access to healthcare, significantly more migraine patients reported running out of medications than those with other diagnoses [20/133 (15.0%) vs. 18/234 (7.7%), &#967;2 = 4.93, p = 0.026]. More avoided seeking medical help for new health problems because of the pandemic [30/133 (22.6%) vs. 30/234 (12.8%), &#967;2 = 5.88, p = 0.015]. Migraine patients were also significantly impacted economically by the pandemic; 43/132 (32.4%) of migraine patients reported losing their jobs as the result of the pandemic versus 34/234 (14.5%) of their peers (&#967;2 = 11.20, p < 0.001). An increase in headache severity or frequency was reported in 39/118 (33.1%) of respondents and 19/118 (16.1%) reported to using more abortive therapy than usual. Telemedicine was well received by almost all patients who took advantage of the option. Most of those patients found telemedicine to be easy to use and as valuable as an in-person visit. Migraine patients indicated with more frequency that without the telemedicine option, they would have missed their medical appointments [37/68 (54.4%) vs. 56/144 (38.6%), &#967;2 = 4.31, p = 0.038]; a majority would prefer or consider telemedicine for future appointments over in-person visits. CONCLUSIONS: Insights gained from this QI survey to the practice's new pandemic-related processes include stressing lifestyle modification, optimizing treatment plans, and continuing the option of telemedicine.","Smith, Maiya; Nakamoto, Max; Crocker, Julie; Tiffany Morden, Frances; Liu, Keke; Ma, Enze; Chong, Ariel; Van, Nicholas; Vajjala, Vimala; Carrazana, Enrique; Viereck, Jason; Liow, Kore",Headache,281,20

One of the consequences of exposure to disasters/pandemics is an increase in alcohol use. The current study aimed to examine what predisposing (distal) and pandemic-related (proximal) factors were associated with increased drinking in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: On 1 April 2020, 5158 Australians completed a survey from the COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy (COLLATE) project, a nationwide study aimed at tracking key mental health concerns. Using logistic regression, distal (demographics and previous drinking behaviors) and proximal (employment, lifestyle factors, and mood) factors were assessed for their association with increased drinking since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Distal factors, including heavier drinking pre-pandemic, middle age, and average or higher income, and proximal factors, including job loss, eating more, changes to sleep as well as stress and depression, were all associated with increased drinking in the COVID-19 pandemic environment. Female sex and self-reported history of mental illness became nonsignificant after proximal measures were added to the model. Living alone, exercise, anxiety, and status as an essential or health-care worker were not associated with increased drinking. CONCLUSION: These results provide guidance as to who might be targeted to receive support based on predisposing demographic factors and pre-pandemic drinking behavior. Second, they indicate what behaviors/factors accompany increased alcohol use and provide targets for psychosocial and psychoeducational supports to address these proximal factors.","Neill, Erica; Meyer, Denny; Toh, Wei Lin; van Rheenen, Tamsyn Elizabeth; Phillipou, Andrea; Tan, Eric Josiah; Rossell, Susan Lee",Psychiatry Clin Neurosci,281,16

Following the introduction of our ERAS protocol, we sought to review our ERAS experience. Our aims were to evaluate the LOS, post-operative complications, discharge analgesia, patient satisfaction and our ERAS protocol compared to the literature. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of all our prospectively managed database between January 2016 and December 2016. Patient demographics, LOS, discharge analgesia and complications were collected. Patient satisfaction was determined using a 10-point Likert scale questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients underwent breast reconstruction using free deep inferior epigastric artery (DIEP) flaps. The mean age at surgery was 51 years (range 23-71). The mean LOS was 4.89 days (range 4-10). 61 patients (87%) were discharged within 5 days. 65 patients (93%) were discharged home on no controlled opioids. Major and minor complications were encountered in 3 patients (4%) and 5 (7%) patients respectively. There were no cases of complete or partial flap failure. 30-day patient satisfaction was high (&gt;9/10) across all domains but patients complained of nausea & vomiting. CONCLUSION: The adoption of our enhanced recovery protocol for autologous breast reconstruction has resulted in a mean LOS and opioid use reduction similar to contemporary literature. However, we have seen that there are further refinements that can be made to our ERAS protocol and there is still a need to develop a stronger evidence base to support our practices. This is in parallel with ongoing education and audit cycles to foster a culture of ERAS that can safely optimise patient outcomes.","Lewis, C; Oates, C; Proussakaia, E",Acta Chir Plast,281,16

The term lockdown was replaced by large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) in Indonesia by more flexible regulations to save the economy. Data on five air pollutants, namely, PM10, SO2, CO, O3, and NO2, from five monitoring stations located in five regions in Jakarta (West, East, Central, North, and South Jakarta) were utilized. We analyzed the changes in the concentrations of outdoor air pollutants before lockdown from January 1 to April 9, 2020, and during lockdown from April 10 to June 4, 2020. Overall, the CO concentration (39.9%) demonstrated the most significant reduction during lockdown, followed by NO2 (7.5%) and then SO2 (5.7%). However, we unexpectedly found that during lockdown, the PM10 concentration in Jakarta increased by 10.9% due to the southwest monsoon during the seasonal change in Jakarta. Among the five cities in Jakarta, East and Central Jakarta experienced the maximum improvement in their air quality, whereas North Jakarta had the least air quality improvement. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to study the effect of lockdown on outdoor air quality improvement in Indonesia using ground-level measurement data.

METHODS: This prospective study was conducted among adults with ESKD treated with in-center hemodialysis (ICHD) in the United States. Exposure was ascribed on the basis of the presence or absence of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, and separately, a history of documented COVID-19 before study entry. Outcomes were assessed after an infection-free period, and were any SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., detected by protocolized PCR tests or during routine clinical surveillance), and clinically manifest COVID-19 (consisting of only the latter). RESULTS: Of 2337 consented participants who met study inclusion criteria, 9.5% were anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive at baseline; 3.6% had a history of COVID-19. Over 6679 patient-months of follow-up, 263 participants had evidence of any SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 141 who had clinically manifest COVID-19. Presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (versus its absence) at baseline was associated with lower risk of any SARS-CoV-2 infection (incidence rate ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.95) and clinically manifest COVID-19 0.21 (95% confidence interval, 0.07 to 0.67). CONCLUSION: Among patients with ESKD, naturally acquired anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity is associated with a 45% lower risk of subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a 79% lower risk of clinically manifest COVID-19. Because natural immunity is incomplete, patients with ESKD should be prioritized for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, independent of their COVID-19 disease history.","Cohen, Dena E; Sibbel, Scott; Marlowe, Gilbert; Bludorn, Kelsey; Miller, Dawn; Kelley, Tara; Connaire, Jeffrey; Young, Amy; Tentori, Francesca; Brunelli, Steven M",J Am Soc Nephrol,281,22

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), calculated at hospital admission and in isolation, for the prediction of the subsequent presence of disease progression and serious clinical outcomes (e.g., shock, death). METHODS: We designed a prospective cohort study of 352 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 between January 9 and February 26, 2020, in Yichang City, Hubei Province. Patients with an NLR equal to or higher than the cutoff value derived from the receiver operating characteristic curve method were classified as the exposed group. The primary outcome was disease deterioration, defined as an increase of the clinical disease severity classification during hospitalization (e.g., moderate to severe/critical; severe to critical). The secondary outcomes were shock and death during the treatment. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 51 (14.5%) patients' conditions deteriorated, 15 patients (4.3%) had complicated septic shock, and 15 patients (4.3%) died. The NLR was higher in patients with deterioration than in those without deterioration (median: 5.33 vs. 2.14, P < 0.001), and higher in patients with serious clinical outcomes than in those without serious clinical outcomes (shock vs. no shock: 6.19 vs. 2.25, P < 0.001; death vs. survival: 7.19 vs. 2.25, P < 0.001). The NLR measured at hospital admission had high value in predicting subsequent disease deterioration, shock and death (all the areas under the curve > 0.80). The sensitivity of an NLR &#8805; 2.6937 for predicting subsequent disease deterioration, shock and death was 82.0% (95% confidence interval, 69.0 to 91.0), 93.3% (68.0 to 100), and 92.9% (66.0 to 100), and the corresponding negative predictive values were 95.7% (93.0 to 99.2), 99.5% (98.6 to 100) and 99.5% (98.6 to 100), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The NLR measured at admission and in isolation can be used to effectively predict the subsequent presence of disease deterioration and serious clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19.","Zeng, Zhi-Yong; Feng, Shao-Dan; Chen, Gong-Ping; Wu, Jiang-Nan",BMC Infect Dis,281,1

The course used active learning methods, and 240 students were working in 42 cross-functional, agile teams. The pandemic caused by the coronavirus had a significant impact on the teaching given by the University of Oslo, as all physical education and collaboration among the teams had to be digital from March 12. At the end of the semester, we conducted a survey that focused on 1) aspects of teamwork (e.g., communication and coordination in the teams) and the relation to team performance (e.g., the application product) and 2), the students' motivation and ability to cooperate through digital platforms. A total of 151 respondents in 41 agile student teams answered the survey. This study aimed to investigate how the teamwork and motivation of the students were affected by having to work virtually. The results are compared to results from the same course in 2019 and a similar survey on 71 professional teams published in 2016. Our results show that the teamwork was evaluated similarly to both the evaluation of survey conducted in 2019 and on the professional teams in 2016.

This increases the subsequent risk of degenerative diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc., which can lead to a higher risk of death. This study aims to evaluate the effect of confinement on the weight load, physical activity and dietary behavior of higher education students during the period of confinement. Methods: Data was collected by an anonymous online questionnaire with 406 students. Physical activity was evaluated with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. A reference score of the National Nutrition and Health Program (PNNS-GS) was used to determine the dietary habits. Stress appreciation was assessed by using a psychological instrument known as the ""Perceived Stress Scale"" provided by Mind Garden. Results: More than a quarter of the students were overweight or obese. During the confinement of COVID-19, most of the students suffered from nutritional disorders, only one-third were moderately physically active, and the majority of students were at risk of stress. Multivariate analysis showed that the concept of threat of Stress increases the risk of weight gain at a risk level of 2.4 [95% CI 1.09-5.43], low physical activity increases the risk level to 1.9 [95% CI 1.18-3.04]. However, a balanced diet is protective against the occurrence of weight gain (ORa = 0.30, [95% CI 0.15-0.61]). Conclusion: The study showed that confinement appeared to contribute to weight gain and those students were more sedentary than active with unhealthy eating behaviors. Understanding these behaviors during COVID-19 confinement will help public health authorities implement future policies on recommendations when new pandemics arrive and confinement policies are implemented.","Boukrim, Mohamed; Obtel, Majdouline; Kasouati, Jalal; Achbani, Abderrahmane; Razine, Rachid",Ann Glob Health,281,20

Using the reference strain SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020, we evaluated modes of transmission and the ability of prior infection or vaccine-induced immunity to protect against infection in ferrets. Ferrets were semipermissive to infection with the USA-WA1/2020 isolate. When transmission was assessed via the detection of viral RNA (vRNA) at multiple time points, direct contact transmission was efficient to 3/3 and 3/4 contact animals in 2 respective studies, while respiratory droplet transmission was poor to only 1/4 contact animals. To determine if previously infected ferrets were protected against reinfection, ferrets were rechallenged 28 or 56 days postinfection. Following viral challenge, no infectious virus was recovered in nasal wash samples. In addition, levels of vRNA in the nasal wash were several orders of magnitude lower than during primary infection, and vRNA was rapidly cleared. To determine if intramuscular vaccination protected ferrets, ferrets were vaccinated using a prime-boost strategy with the S protein receptor-binding domain formulated with an oil-in-water adjuvant. Upon viral challenge, none of the mock or vaccinated animals were protected against infection, and there were no significant differences in vRNA or infectious virus titers in the nasal wash. Combined, these studies demonstrate direct contact is the predominant mode of transmission of the USA-WA1/2020 isolate in ferrets and that immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is maintained for at least 56 days. Our studies also indicate protection of the upper respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2 will require vaccine strategies that mimic natural infection or induce site-specific immunity. IMPORTANCE The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) USA-WA1/2020 strain is a CDC reference strain used by multiple research laboratories. Here, we show that the predominant mode of transmission of this isolate in ferrets is by direct contact. We further demonstrate ferrets are protected against reinfection for at least 56 days even when levels of neutralizing antibodies are low or undetectable. Last, we show that when ferrets were vaccinated by the intramuscular route to induce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, ferrets remain susceptible to infection of the upper respiratory tract. Collectively, these studies suggest that protection of the upper respiratory tract will require vaccine approaches that mimic natural infection.","Patel, Devanshi R; Field, Cassandra J; Septer, Kayla M; Sim, Derek G; Jones, Matthew J; Heinly, Talia A; Vanderford, Thomas H; McGraw, Elizabeth A; Sutton, Troy C",J Virol,281,20

Here we assess the performance of the selected LFIA to detect antibody responses in individuals who have received at least one dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. MethodsThis is a prospective diagnostic accuracy study. SettingSampling was carried out at renal outpatient clinic and healthcare worker testing sites at Imperial College London NHS Trust. Laboratory analyses were performed across Imperial College London sites and university facilities. ParticipantsTwo cohorts of patients were recruited; the first was a cohort of 108 renal transplant patients attending clinic following SARS-CoV-2 vaccine booster, the second cohort comprised 40 healthcare workers attending for first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and 21 day follow up. A total of 186 paired samples were collected. InterventionsDuring the participants visit, capillary blood samples were analysed on LFIA device, while paired venous sampling was sent for serological assessment of antibodies to the spike protein (anti-S) antibodies. Anti-S IgG were detected using the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Quant II CMIA. Main outcome measuresThe accuracy of Fortress LFIA in detecting IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 compared to anti-spike protein detection on Abbott Assay. ResultsUsing the threshold value for positivity on serological testing of [≥]7.10 BAU/ml, the overall performance of the test produces an estimate of sensitivity of 91.94% (95% CI 85.67% to 96.06%) and specificity of 93.55% (95% CI 84.30% to 98.21%) using the Abbott assay as reference standard.

The heterotrophic bacterium Cupriavidus pinatubonensis JMP134 contains several enzymes involved in sulfur oxidation, but how these enzymes work together to oxidize sulfide in the bacterium has not been studied. Using gene-deletion and whole cell assays, we determined that the bacterium uses sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase to oxidize sulfide to polysulfide, which is further oxidized to sulfite by persulfide dioxygenase. Sulfite spontaneously reacts with polysulfide to produce thiosulfate. The Sox system oxidizes thiosulfate to sulfate. Flavocytochrome c sulfide dehydrogenase enhances thiosulfate oxidation by the Sox system, but couples with the Sox system for sulfide oxidation to sulfate in the absence of sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase. Thus, C. pinatubonensis JMP134 contains a main pathway and a contingent pathway for sulfide oxidation.Importance We establish a new pathway of sulfide oxidation with thiosulfate as a key intermediate in Cupriavidus pinatubonensis JMP134. The bacterium mainly oxidizes sulfide by using sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase, persulfide dioxygenase, and the Sox system with thiosulfate as a key intermediate. Although the purified and reconstituted Sox system oxidizes sulfide, its rate of sulfide oxidation in C. pinatubonensis JMP134 is too low to be physiologically relevant. The findings reveal how these sulfur oxidizing enzymes participate in sulfide oxidation in a single bacterium.","Xin, Yufeng; Gao, Rui; Cui, Feifei; Lü, Chuanjuan; Liu, Honglei; Liu, Huaiwei; Xia, Yongzhen; Xun, Luying",,281,29

The objective of this study was to examine differences in the international experience of paediatric ED utilisation and disposition at five different children's hospitals. METHODS: We obtained data on ED volume, acuity level and disposition (hospitalisation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission) for the time period 1 December1-10 August for the years 2017-2020 from hospitals in five cities (Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Singapore; Melbourne, Australia; Seattle, Washington, USA; and Paris, France). Per cent change was analysed using paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: Overall ED volume dramatically decreased in all five hospitals during the early months of COVID-19 compared with prior years. There was a more varied response of decreases in ED volume by acuity level, hospitalisation and ICU admission among the five hospitals. The one exception was a 2% increase in ICU admissions in Paris.

Virus infection requires the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Although studies have demonstrated anti-spike and -RBD antibodies to be protective in animal models, and convalescent plasma as a promising therapeutic option, little is known about immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes capable of blocking infection. METHODS: We studied spike- and RBD-specific Ig isotypes in convalescent and acute plasma/sera using a multiplex bead assay. We also determined virus neutralization activities in plasma, sera, and purified Ig fractions using a VSV pseudovirus assay. RESULTS: Spike- and RBD-specific IgM, IgG1, and IgA1 were produced by all or nearly all subjects at variable levels and detected early after infection. All samples displayed neutralizing activity. Regression analyses revealed that IgM and IgG1 contributed most to neutralization, consistent with IgM and IgG fractions' neutralization potency. IgA also exhibited neutralizing activity, but with lower potency. CONCLUSION: IgG, IgM and IgA are critical components of convalescent plasma used for COVID-19 treatment.","Klingler, Jéromine; Weiss, Svenja; Itri, Vincenza; Liu, Xiaomei; Oguntuyo, Kasopefoluwa Y; Stevens, Christian; Ikegame, Satoshi; Hung, Chuan-Tien; Enyindah-Asonye, Gospel; Amanat, Fatima; Baine, Ian; Arinsburg, Suzanne; Bandres, Juan C; Kojic, Erna Milunka; Stoever, Jonathan; Jurczyszak, Denise; Bermudez-Gonzalez, Maria; Nádas, Arthur; Liu, Sean; Lee, Benhur; Zolla-Pazner, Susan; Hioe, Catarina E",J. infect. dis,281,1

Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in over 86.7 million cases and over 1.87 million deaths worldwide (WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard). Coronavirus spike glycoproteins assist in entry and infection of cells by binding to the human ACE2 receptor. Because of this, they are the main target for antibodies and inhibitors (Walls et al., 2020). There are many different strains of coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Although these are both ?-coronaviruses that bind to the ACE2 receptor through a spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be less deadly but more easily transmissible than SARS-CoV-1 (Fani et al., 2020). We hypothesized that the variations in the structure of the spike proteins in different strains cause these different characteristics. In order to understand the structural differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 spike proteins, we compared their structures by aligning them using PyMOL, a molecular visualization system. We observed that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike proteins have differences in their structure. We will study these to identify their significance. The structure of a protein is directly related to its function which is why we think that this investigation is crucial to understanding COVID-19. We expect that these regions are important for specific drug targets for SARS-CoV-2.","Cetin, Sena Ng Sydney Zunino Marzia",The FASEB Journal,281,20

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess quality of guidelines on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), developed in the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic and assess if recommendations for pharmacotherapy were supported by evidence. METHODS: We performed the search for documents, that considered antiviral therapies and contained a recommendations for clinicians. The quality of the guidelines was assessed using the AGREE II-Global Rating Scale Instrument and series of additional criteria. RESULTS: The analysis included 40 publications. The median of quality of documents assessed with the AGREE II-GRS tool was 2.0 (interquartile range 1.5-2.5). Most documents did not fulfill the rigour of guideline development quality criteria. The AGREE II-GRS scores did not differ significantly across the type of the document, issuing institution and the mode of publication. 75% of documents provided recommendations for the use of antiviral medications despite apparent lack of sufficient evidence supporting such treatments. Of the included documents, 75% were not updated within the 2 months after the publication of the first randomized controlled trial on COVID-19 antiviral therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Most guidelines or guidance documents published during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic were of poor quality, contained recommendations for the use of antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection despite only very low quality of evidence available, and were not updated on a regular basis.","Mejza, Filip; Lesniak, Wiktoria; Jaeschke, Roman",Pol Arch Intern Med,281,20

The data generated by an epidemiological surveillance program allow for obtaining valid information on the diseases' epidemiology and possible prevention methods. OBJECTIVE: This work aims to analyze COVID-19 epidemiology among healthcare staff based in the Seville healthcare district (Spain) and evaluate its role in outbreaks in nursing homes. METHODS: This is an observational, descriptive study of 88 assisted living facilities located in the city of Seville from March 1 to May 23, 2020. Data were obtained via epidemiological surveys on staff at centers where there were outbreaks (n=732 in 14 nursing homes). The cumulative incidence (CI), epidemic curves, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and delays in isolation and notification of cases were calculated. For the statistical analysis, measures of central tendency and dispersion were used as well as confidence intervals and statistical hypothesis tests. RESULTS: There were 124 cases in staff members (CI 16.9%), 78.6% of which were in women. The majority presented with mild symptoms (87.1%). The most common symptoms were fever (50%) and cough (32.3%). The median number of days from onset of symptoms to isolation was three. CONCLUSIONS: A high incidence in nursing home staff along with delays in isolation were observed, which could affect the dynamics of transmission in outbreaks. It is necessary to review disease identification and isolation practices among staff as well as emphasize rapid implementation of prevention measures.","Morales Viera, A; Rivas Rodríguez, R; Otero Aguilar, P; de Blanca, E Briones Pérez",Rev. clin. esp.

By March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared a pandemic. Containment measures such as social distancing and hand hygiene were recommended. In this study, we start from the hypothesis that engaging with containment measures in a pandemic situation should be more comfortable for some people than for other people. Thus, individual differences should be associated with engagement with containment measures. OBJECTIVE: To investigate to what extent two personality traits, extroversion and conscientiousness, are associated with engagement with two containment measures (social distancing and handwashing). METHODS: The sample consisted of 715 Brazilian adults aged 18-78 years, who answered the Big Five Inventory 2 Short (BFI-2-S) and factors from the Dimensional Clinical Personality Inventory 2 (IDCP-2). RESULTS: Higher scores for extroversion were associated with lower means for social distancing (p < 0.001) and higher scores for conscientiousness were associated with higher means for social distancing and handwashing (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings indicate the importance of acknowledging extroversion and conscientiousness traits as relevant to people's engagement with the measures recommended for COVID-19 containment.","Carvalho, Lucas de F; Pianowski, Giselle; Gonçalves, André P",Trends psychiatry psychother.

Upon the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese government dispatched about 42 000 HCWs to Wuhan City and Hubei Province to fight this pandemic. This study briefly examines front-line nurses who experienced burnout, with the main objective of investigating the mediating roles of positive and negative affect in the relationship between resilience and burnout in Wuhan hospitals at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 180 front-line nurses voluntarily participated via a social media group. They completed the online questionnaires, including the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), demographics, and work-related characteristics. Structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis was used to examine the mediating effect of positive and negative affect on the relationship between resilience and burnout. The total prevalence of burnout was 51.7%, of which 15.0% were severe burnout. These preliminary results revealed that positive and negative affect fully mediated the effects of resilience on burnout, emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment of front-line nurses. It is necessary to know the impact of resilience on HCWs with burnout through the positive and negative affect of individual backgrounds and situations, and how policymakers can deploy resilience interventions to support front-line HCWs.","Zhang, Xiaoning; Jiang, Xue; Ni, Pingping; Li, Haiyang; Li, Chong; Zhou, Qiong; Ou, Zhengyan; Guo, Yuqing; Cao, Junli",Int J Ment Health Nurs,281,1

Constituencies within national publics benefit from the individual career and prosperity benefits of globalization. Conservative populist constituency ingroups react hostilely to the perceived threat to their traditional status as the core cultural community within nation states. This response produced the political victory of the 2106 Donald Trump presidential campaign. Reactionary populism emerges from perceived threat to core cultural group traditional supremacy within the national polity, heretofore setting the institutionalized, stereotyped norms of individual and constituency behavior and relations. In the US, their status grievances utilize the language of conservative evangelical Christian identity to mobilize their social movement political resources. They draw upon American foundational settler colonial ideologies with a basis in slavery and casteism. Postwar emerging transnational normative authority centers progressively challenge the utilitarian relevance of these parochial, ascriptive norms and ethics. Post-Cold-War reactionary trends displaying nationalist values have intensified globally, and the disruptions in individual and collective formal and informal institutionalized behaviors and role expectations due to the COVID-19 pandemic intensify them. These consequences foreshadow the knock-on effects of anthropogenic climate change. Liberal progressive political strategic responses can highlight transnational diaspora political activism as offering opportunities for pluralization of the American nation state. Communities marginalized as legacies of imperial expansion and settler colonialism display mobilizational capacities to promote government incentivization for corporate environmental, social and governance investment goals that support global sustainable development.

We analyzed the incidence and severity of COVID-19 patients with ILD among 3201 COVID-19 inpatients, and compared two independent cohorts of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing ILD (n = 28) and non-ILD COVID-19 patients (n = 130). Among those 3201 COVID-19 inpatients, 28 of whom were COVID-19 with ILD (0.88%). Fever was the predominant symptom both in COVID-19 with ILD (81.54%) and non-ILD COVID-19 patients (72.22%). However, COVID-19 patients with ILD were more likely to have cough, sputum, fatigue, dyspnea, and diarrhea. A very significantly higher number of neutrophils, monocytes, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10, IL-1ß, and D-Dimer was characterized in COVID-19 with ILD as compared to those of non-ILD COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, logistic regression models showed neutrophils counts, proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL6, IL1ß, IL2R), and coagulation dysfunction biomarkers (D-Dimer, PT, Fbg) were significantly associated with the poor clinical outcomes of COVID-19. ILD patients could be less vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. However, ILD patients tend to severity condition after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. The prognosis of COVID-19 patients with per-existing ILD is significantly worse than that of non-ILD patients. And more, aggravated inflammatory responses and coagulation dysfunction appear to be the critical mechanisms in the COVID-19 patients with ILD.","Huang, Hong; Zhang, Ming; Chen, Can; Zhang, Huilan; Wei, Yanqiu; Tian, Jianbo; Shang, Jin; Deng, Yan; Du, Aihua; Dai, Huaping",J Med Virol,281,21

However, the pathogenic mechanism is still not fully understood. In the present study, we identified 1,631 upregulated and 1,515 downregulated genes and found that cell cycle and metabolism-related pathways or biological processes highly dysregulated in HCC. To assess the biological importance of these DEGs, we carried out weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify the functional modules potentially involved in HCC pathogenesis or progression. The five modules were detected with Dynamic Tree Cut algorithm, and GO enrichment analysis revealed that these modules exhibited different biological processes or signaling pathways, such as metabolism-related pathways, cell proliferation-related pathways, and molecules in tumor microenvironment. Moreover, we also observed two immune cells, namely, cytotoxic cells and macrophage enriched in modules grey and brown, respectively, while T helper cell-2 (Th2) was enriched in module turquoise. Among the WGCNA network, four hub long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified to be associated with HCC prognostic outcomes, suggesting that coexpression network analysis could uncover lncRNAs with functional importance, which may be associated with prognostic outcomes of HCC patients. In summary, this study demonstrated that network-based analysis could identify some functional modules and some hub-lncRNAs, which may be critical for HCC pathogenesis or progression.","Li, Jianguo; Zhou, Jin; Kai, Shuangshuang; Wang, Can; Wang, Daijun; Jiang, Jiying",Biomed Res Int,281,8

Additional cell receptors may be directly or indirectly involved, including integrins. The cytoplasmic tails of ACE2 and integrins contain several predicted short linear motifs (SLiMs) that may facilitate internalization of the virus as well as its subsequent propagation through processes such as autophagy. Here, we measured the binding affinity of predicted interactions between SLiMs in the cytoplasmic tails of ACE2 and integrin ß3 with proteins that mediate endocytic trafficking and autophagy. We validated that a class I PDZ-binding motif mediated binding of ACE2 to the scaffolding proteins SNX27, NHERF3, and SHANK, and that a binding site for the clathrin adaptor AP2 µ2 in ACE2 overlaps with a phospho-dependent binding site for the SH2 domains of Src family tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, we validated that an LC3-interacting region (LIR) in integrin ß3 bound to the ATG8 domains of the autophagy receptors MAP1LC3 and GABARAP in a manner enhanced by LIR-adjacent phosphorylation. Our results provide molecular links between cell receptors and mediators of endocytosis and autophagy that may facilitate viral entry and propagation.","Kliche, Johanna; Kuss, Hanna; Ali, Muhammad; Ivarsson, Ylva",Sci. signal,281,10

On June 6, 2020, the presentation of accumulated cases and deaths was stopped, and the Supreme Court of Brazil determined that the federal government should continue to consolidate and disseminate the accumulated figures of cases and deaths. However, doubt about the transparency of the data remained. We used data reported by the government from Situation Reports 38-209 of the World Health Organization to assess the Benford's law fulfillment as an indicator of data quality. This rapid evaluation of data quality during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil suggests that the Brazilian public health surveillance system had an acceptable performance at the beginning of the epidemic.

We demonstrate that even in biased models (which focus on spurious correlation) there still exist unbiased functional subnetworks. Furthermore, we articulate and demonstrate the functional lottery ticket hypothesis: full network contains a subnetwork that can achieve better OOD performance. We then propose Modular Risk Minimization to solve the subnetwork selection problem. Our algorithm learns the subnetwork structure from a given dataset, and can be combined with any other OOD regularization methods.

This study examines how such pandemic-related changes in work and life patterns were associated with depressive symptoms. METHODS: An online survey among participants who use a health app called CALO mama was conducted from 30 April to 8 May 2020 in Japan. Participants consisted of 2846 users (1150 men (mean age=50.3) and 1696 women (mean age=43.0)) who were working prior to the government declaration of a state of emergency (7 April 2020). Their daily steps from 1 January to 13 May 2020 recorded by an accelerometer in their mobile devices were linked to their responses. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Two-Question Screen. RESULTS: On average, participants took 1143.8 (95% CI -1557.3 to -730.2) fewer weekday steps during the declaration period (from 7 April to 13 May). Depressive symptoms were positively associated with female gender (OR=1.58, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.87), decreased weekday steps (OR=1.22, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.45) and increased working hours (OR=1.73, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.26). Conversely, starting WFH was negatively associated with depressive symptoms (OR=0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased weekday steps during the declaration period were associated with increased odds of depressive symptoms, but WFH may mitigate the risk in the short term. Further studies on the longitudinal effects of WFH on health are needed.","Sato, Koryu; Sakata, Ryohei; Murayama, Chiaki; Yamaguchi, Mai; Matsuoka, Yoko; Kondo, Naoki",Occup. environ. med,281,16

In my analysis, I rely upon two data sets: the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which is a triennial survey of household financial condition, and the Individual Tax Model Public Use File (PUF), an annual sample of individual income tax returns. While focusing on the six income and wealth shares of the top 10 to the top 0.01 percent between 1988 and 2018, my results suggest that ignoring uncertainties in estimated wealth and income shares can lead to erroneous conclusions about the current state of the economy and, therefore, lead to inaccurate predictions and ineffective policy recommendations. My analysis suggests that for the six top-decile income shares under consideration, the PUF estimates are considerably better than those constructed using the SCF; for wealth shares of the top 10 to the top 0.5 percent, the SCF estimates appear to be more reliable than the PUF estimates; finally, for the two most granular wealth shares, the top 0.1 and 0.01 percent, both data sets present non-trivial challenges that cannot be readily addressed.","Boczon, Marta",,281,21

Our findings showed that quarantine should be the best strategy for containing COVID-19. Nationwide lockdown also showed positive impact, whereas social distancing should be considered to be effective only in combination with other interventions including the closure of schools and commercial activities and the limitation of public transportation. Our findings also showed that all the interventions should be initiated early in the pandemic and continued for a sustained period.

However, the implications of telemedicine on patient-physician interaction, patient satisfaction, and absence of the personal touch have not been studied to date. Following the spread of COVID-19, telemedicine services were rapidly incorporated at the Oncology Division of Tel Aviv Medical Center. We aimed to evaluate patients' perspectives and preferences regarding telemedicine and to assess whether this virtual communication platform affects the patient-physician relationship. METHODS: Between March 2020 and May 2020, adult cancer patients who conducted at least one successful telemedicine meeting were interviewed by trained medical personnel. The interview was based on validated patient satisfaction questionnaires and focused on patient-physician interaction in relation to the last in-patient visit. RESULTS: Of 236 patients, 172 (74%) patients agreed to participate. The study population comprised mainly patients with gastrointestinal malignancies (n = 79, 46%) with a median age of 63 years (range 21-88). The majority of patients were male (n = 93, 54%). Eighty-nine (51.7%) patients were receiving active oncologic treatment, and 58 (33.7%) were under routine surveillance following completion of active therapy. Almost all had a sense of secured privacy (n = 171, 96%), the majority of patients affirmed that their concerns were met (n = 166, 93%) and perceived that eye contact with the treating physician was perceived (n = 156, 87%). Only a minority felt that the absence of physical clinic visits harmed their treatment (n = 36, 20%). Most patients (n = 146, 84.9%) wished to continue telemedicine services. A multivariate analysis revealed that higher satisfaction and visits for routine surveillance were both predictors of willingness to continue future telemedicine meetings over physical encounters (odds ratio [OR] = 2.41, p = .01; OR = 3.34, p = .03, respectively). CONCLUSION: Telemedicine is perceived as safe and effective, and patients did not feel that it compromised medical care or the patient-physician relationship. Integration of telemedicine is ideal for patients under surveillance after completion of active oncologic treatment. Physician communication skills workshops are warranted with implementing this platform. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine was rapidly implemented worldwide to facilitate continuity of quality care and treatment. Despite many potential setbacks, telemedicine has become a useful and safe tool for oncology practitioners to care for their patients. The use of telemedicine regarding patients' perspectives, emotions, and patient-physician communication in daily oncology practice has not been studied to date. This study demonstrated telemedicine is perceived as safe and effective and does not compromise medical care or the patient-physician relationship. Its use is ideal for surveillance after completion of active oncologic treatment. Physician communication skills workshops are warranted with implementing this platform.","Hasson, Shira Peleg; Waissengrin, Barliz; Shachar, Eliya; Hodruj, Marah; Fayngor, Rochelle; Brezis, Mirika; Nikolaevski-Berlin, Alla; Pelles, Sharon; Safra, Tamar; Geva, Ravit; Wolf, Ido",Oncologist,281,16

Severe forms are marked by a high mortality rate. The objective of this study is to identify routine biomarkers that can serve as early predictors of the disease progression. This is a prospective, single-center, cohort study involving 330 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who were admitted at the University Hospital of Blida, Algeria in the period between the 27th of March and 22nd of April 2020. The ROC curve was used to evaluate the predictive performance of biomarkers, assessed at admission, in the early warning of progression toward severity. Multivariate logistic regression was used to quantify the independent risk for each marker. After an average follow-up period of 13.9 ± 3.5 days, 143 patients (43.3%) were classified as severe cases. Six biological abnormalities were identified as potential risk markers independently related to the severity: elevated urea nitrogen (>8.0 mmol/L, OR = 9.3 [2.7-31.7], p < .00001), elevated CRP (>42mg/L, OR = 7.5 [2.4-23.3], p = .001), decreased natremia (<133. 6 mmol/L, OR = 6.0 [2.0-17.4], p = .001), decreased albumin (<33.5 g/L, OR = 5.2 [1.7-16.6], p = .003), elevated LDH (>367 IU/L, OR = 4.9 [1.7-14.2], p = .003) and elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (>7.99, OR = 4.2, [1.4-12.2], p = .009). These easy-to-measure, time-saving and very low-cost parameters have been shown to be effective in the early prediction of the COVID-19 severity. Their use at the early admission stage can improve the risk stratification and management of medical care resources in order to reduce the mortality rate.","Bennouar, Salam; Bachir Cherif, Abdelghani; Kessira, Amel; Hamel, Hadjer; Boudahdir, Adel; Bouamra, Abderrazek; Bennouar, Djameleddine; Abdi, Samia",Scand J Clin Lab Invest,281,29

To adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic situation, we adopted a blended learning approach to anatomy instruction that included online lectures, pre-recorded laboratory dissection videos, and 3D anatomy applications, with condensed offline cadaver dissection. METHODS: We aimed to examine the learning outcomes of a newly adopted anatomy educational approach by 1) comparing academic achievement between the blended learning group (the 2020 class, 108 students) and the traditional classroom learning group (the 2019 class, 104 students), and 2) an online questionnaire survey on student preference on the learning method and reasons of preference. RESULTS: The average anatomy examination scores of the 2020 class, who took online lectures and blended dissection laboratories, were significantly higher than those of the 2019 class, who participated in an offline lecture and dissection laboratories. The questionnaire survey revealed that students preferred online lectures over traditional large group lecture-based teaching because it allowed them to acquire increased self-study time, study according to their individual learning styles, and repeatedly review lecture videos. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that a blended learning approach is an effective method for anatomy learning, and the advantage may result from increased self-directed study through online learning.","Yoo, Hyeijung; Kim, Dasom; Lee, Young Mee; Rhyu, Im Joo",J Korean Med Sci,281,10

Current COVID-19 time series for many countries are short: pre- and post-lockdown series are shorter still. Accurate estimation of potentially interesting cycles within such series seems beyond reach. We solve the problem of obtaining accurate estimates from short time series by using recent Bayesian spectral fusion methods. Here we show that transformed new daily COVID-19 cases for many countries generally contain three cycles operating at wavelengths of around 2.7, 4.1 and 6.7 days (weekly). We show that the shorter cycles are suppressed after lockdown. The pre- and post lockdown differences suggest that the weekly effect is at least partly due to non-epidemic factors, whereas the two shorter cycles seem intrinsic to the epidemic. Unconstrained, new cases grow exponentially, but the internal cyclic structure causes periodic falls in cases. This suggests that lockdown success might only be indicated by four or more daily falls in cases. Spectral learning for epidemic time series contributes to the understanding of the epidemic process, helping evaluate interventions and assists with forecasting. Spectral fusion is a general technique that is able to fuse spectra recorded at different sampling rates, which can be applied to a wide range of time series from many disciplines.","Nason, Guy P.",,281,24

The purpose of this study was to understand patients' perspectives on how the side effects of CIM are managed in routine clinical practice. METHODS: An online survey was conducted of participants with breast, lung, or colorectal cancer who had received chemotherapy treatment within the past 12 months, and had experienced at least one episode of myelosuppression in the past year. The survey was administered with predominantly close-ended questions, and lay definitions of key terms were provided to aid response selection. RESULTS: Of 301 participants who completed the online survey, 153 (51%) had breast cancer, 100 (33%) had lung cancer, and 48 (16%) had colorectal cancer. Anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia were reported by 61%, 59%, 37%, and 34% of participants, respectively. Most participants (79%) reported having received treatment for CIM, and 64% of participants recalled chemotherapy dose modifications as a result of CIM. Although most participants believed their oncologist was aware of the side effects of CIM, and treated them quickly, 30% of participants felt their oncologists did not understand how uncomfortable they were due to the side effects of CIM. Overall, 88% of participants considered CIM to have a moderate or major impact on their lives. CONCLUSION: The data highlight that despite the various methods used to address CIM, and the patient-focused approach of oncologists, the real-world impact of CIM on patients is substantial. Improving communication between patients and health care providers may help improve patients' understanding of CIM, and foster shared decision-making in terms of treatment. Additional insights from patients should be obtained to further elucidate the totality of life burden associated with CIM.","Epstein, Robert S; Aapro, Matti S; Basu Roy, Upal K; Salimi, Tehseen; Krenitsky, JoAnn; Leone-Perkins, Megan L; Girman, Cynthia; Schlusser, Courtney; Crawford, Jeffrey",Adv Ther,281,8

Currently, >200 countries and regions have been affected by the epidemic, with the number of infections and deaths still increasing. As an extreme event, the outbreak of COVID-19 has greatly damaged the global economic growth and caused a certain impact on the environment. This paper takes China as a case study, comprehensively evaluating the dynamic impact of COVID-19 on the environment. The analysis results indicate that the outbreak of COVID-19 improves China's air quality in the short term and significantly contributes to global carbon emission reduction. However, in the long run, there is no evidence that this improvement will continue. When China completely lifts the lockdown and resumes large-scale industrial production, its energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are likely to exceed the level before the event. Moreover, COVID-19 significantly reduces the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the atmosphere. The decline initially occurred near Wuhan and eventually spread to the whole country. The above phenomenon shows that the decreasing economic activities and traffic restrictions directly lead to the changes of China's energy consumption and further prevent the environment from pollution. The results in this study support the fact that strict quarantine measures can not only protect the public from COVID-19, but also exert a positive impact on the environment. These findings can provide a reference for other countries to assess the influence of COVID-19 on the environment.","Wang, Qiang; Su, Min",Sci Total Environ,281,20

(Special Issue: COVID-19.)",10.706988,8.9062195,2021,"BACKGROUND: We previously reported that olaparib led to significantly longer imaging-based progression-free survival than the physician's choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone among men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had qualifying alterations in homologous recombination repair genes and whose disease had progressed during previous treatment with a next-generation hormonal agent. The results of the final analysis of overall survival have not yet been reported. METHODS: In an open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive olaparib (256 patients) or the physician's choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone plus prednisone as the control therapy (131 patients). Cohort A included 245 patients with at least one alteration in BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM, and cohort B included 142 patients with at least one alteration in any of the other 12 prespecified genes. Crossover to olaparib was allowed after imaging-based disease progression for patients who met certain criteria. Overall survival in cohort A, a key secondary end point, was analyzed with the use of an alpha-controlled, stratified log-rank test at a data maturity of approximately 60%. The primary and other key secondary end points were reported previously. RESULTS: The median duration of overall survival in cohort A was 19.1 months with olaparib and 14.7 months with control therapy (hazard ratio for death, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50 to 0.97; P = 0.02). In cohort B, the median duration of overall survival was 14.1 months with olaparib and 11.5 months with control therapy. In the overall population (cohorts A and B), the corresponding durations were 17.3 months and 14.0 months. Overall, 86 of 131 patients (66%) in the control group crossed over to receive olaparib (56 of 83 patients [67%] in cohort A). A sensitivity analysis that adjusted for crossover to olaparib showed hazard ratios for death of 0.42 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.91) in cohort A, 0.83 (95% CI, 0.11 to 5.98) in cohort B, and 0.55 (95% CI, 0.29 to 1.06) in the overall population. CONCLUSIONS: Among men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had tumors with at least one alteration in BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM and whose disease had progressed during previous treatment with a next-generation hormonal agent, those who were initially assigned to receive olaparib had a significantly longer duration of overall survival than those who were assigned to receive enzalutamide or abiraterone plus prednisone as the control therapy, despite substantial crossover from control therapy to olaparib.

The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the significant targets to design and amplify antiviral drugs. In this investigation, we optimized a nucleoside, uridine, and some of its acylated derivatives (2-14) using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/3-21G level of theory. Charge distribution, polarizability, and thermodynamic properties such as free energy, heat capacity, entropy, of modified compounds were studied in the subsequent analysis to evaluate how certain groups (aliphatic and aromatic) impact the drug properties. It was observed that all derivatives were thermodynamically more stable than the parent ligand, uridine, and some of them were more chemically reactive than others. Then, molecular docking was performed against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB: 6Y84 and 6LU7) to investigate the binding mode (s) and binding affinities of the selected uridine derivatives. Most of the compounds studied here could bind near the crucial catalytic residues, HIS41 and CYS145 of the main protease and surrounded by other active site residues such as GLY143, MET49, MET165, HIS163, PRO168, GLU166, GLN189 and SER144. Significant binding affinities (-6.0 to -7.8 kcal mol(-1)) for 6LU7 and (-5.9 to -7.7 kcal mol(-1)) for 6Y84 were found which revealed the potency of inhibition of uridine derivatives against SARS-CoV-2 M-pro. Finally, all the modified uridine derivatives were analyzed in silico ADMET and drug-like properties. Overall, the present study could be helpful for the development of uridine-based novel potential inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2 M-pro.","Maowa, J.; Hosen, M. A.; Alam, A.; Rana, K.

The e-survey form was shared by the researchers via the web for a month, and those who completed the survey were included in the study and formed the sample of the research. RESULTS: Seven hundred fifty-nine were participated. 49.7% of the participants stated to be vaccinated; 38.4% of them stated to be vaccinated their children against COVID-19; if the vaccine for COVID-19 is developed. The request for the COVID-19 vaccine had relationship with gender, occupation, health insurance, anxiety level, having children, willing to get vaccinated for their children.

METHODS: All patients attending Tanta University hospital for receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF injections were screened. Patients who were previously deferred according to a modified protocol implemented in the hospital in response to the pandemic or who demonstrated deviation from it were included for further analysis. RESULTS: During the audit period, 83 patients attending for anti-VEGF injections were screened, of whom 40 met the abovementioned criteria and were included for analysis. In the deferred subgroup (11 eyes), predeferral mean values of logMAR best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal subfield thickness (CST) were 1 ± 0.23 and 444.57 ± 200.1 µm, respectively. There was no significant change when the patients returned for their deferred injections, with the mean BCVA and CST values being 0.8 ± 0.22 and 413.71 ± 237.7 µm, respectively (p = 0.27 and p = 0.12). Moreover, 29 patients encountered a disturbed injection schedule, particularly skipping their injection appointments due to infection fear as found in 18 patients. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed pressing challenges in maintaining essential health care while ensuring the prevention of spread of infection.

We showed that RBD appears as a monomer in solution, whereas S1, S-WT, and S-2P associate as homotrimers with substantial glycosylation.

Overall, the four proteins confer excellent antigenicity with convalescent COVID-19 patient sera in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), yet show distinct reactivities in immunoblotting. RBD, S-WT and S-2P, but not S1, induce high neutralization titres (>3-log) in mice after a three-round immunization regimen. The high immunogenicity of S-2P could be maintained at the lowest dose (1â µg) with the inclusion of an aluminium adjuvant. Higher doses (20â µg) of S-2P can elicit high neutralization titres in non-human primates that exceed 40-times the mean titres measured in convalescent COVID-19 subjects. Our results suggest that the prefusion trimer-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S-protein from insect cells may offer a potential candidate strategy for the development of a recombinant COVID-19 vaccine.","Li, Tingting; Zheng, Qingbing; Yu, Hai; Wu, Dinghui; Xue, Wenhui; Xiong, Hualong; Huang, Xiaofen; Nie, Meifeng; Yue, Mingxi; Rong, Rui; Zhang, Sibo; Zhang, Yuyun; Wu, Yangtao; Wang, Shaojuan; Zha, Zhenghui; Chen, Tingting; Deng, Tingting; Wang, Yingbin; Zhang, Tianying; Chen, Yixin; Yuan, Quan; Zhao, Qinjian; Zhang, Jun; Gu, Ying; Li, Shaowei; Xia, Ningshao",Emerg Microbes Infect,281,1

Accordingly, 1.83-m (6-feet) social distancing is advised to reduce the spread of the disease among humans. This is based on the assumption that no air circulation exists around people. However, it is not well investigated whether the ambient wind and relative humidity (RH) will cause SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets to transport farther in the air, and make the current social distancing policy insufficient. To provide evidence and insight into the ""social distancing"" guidelines, a validated computational fluid-particle dynamics (CFPD) model was employed to simulate the transient transport, condensation/evaporation, and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets emitted by coughs, with different environmental wind velocities and RHs. Initial droplet diameters range from 2 to 2000 µm, and the wind velocities range from 0 to 16 km/h, representing different wind forces from calm air to moderate breeze. The comparison between a steady-state wind and a gust with a constant frequency has also been performed. Ambient RHs are 40% and 99.5%. The distances between the two virtual humans are 1.83 m and 3.05 m (6 feet and 10 feet). The facial covering effect on reducing the airborne transmission of the cough droplets has also been evaluated. Numerical results indicate that the ambient wind will enhance the complexity of the secondary flows with recirculation between the two virtual humans. Microdroplets follow the airflow streamlines well and deposit on both human bodies and head regions, even with the 3.05-m (10-feet) separation distance. The rest of the microdroplets can transport in the air farther than 3.05 m (10 feet) due to wind convection, causing a potential health risk to nearby people. High RH will increase the droplet sizes due to the hygroscopic growth effect, which increases the deposition fractions on both humans and the ground. With the complex environmental wind and RH conditions, the 6-feet social distancing policy may not be sufficient to protect the inter-person aerosol transmission, since the suspending micro-droplets were influenced by convection effects and can transport from the human coughs/sneezes to the other human in less than 5 seconds. Due to the complex real-world environmental ventilation conditions, a social distance longer than 1.83 m (6 feet) needs to be considered. Wearing masks should also be recommended for both infected and healthy humans to reduce the airborne cough droplet numbers.","Feng, Yu; Marchal, Thierry; Sperry, Ted; Yi, Hang",J Aerosol Sci,281,1

DESIGN: Prospective cohort observational study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n =62) who completed an exercise training programme after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy treatment between May 2017 and May 2018 were included. Patients exercised for 20-50 min 3-5 times weekly for 3 months and were assigned to the active (&#8805; 10 min/day) or non-active (< 10 min/day) group based on changes in walking times between baseline and 3 months, as assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. RESULTS: The 6-min walk distance improved in both groups with exercise training. Physical activity level did not increase in some patients, despite improvements in exercise tolerance. Depression improved significantly in the active group, but no correlation was found with physical activity. Factors contributing to physical activity changes were not identified. The all-cause hospitalization rate was lower in the active group during follow-up (mean 10.5 months). CONCLUSION: Exercise training effectively increased 6-min walk distance regardless of physical activity. Non-active patients experienced increased all-cause hospitalizations. Increasing physical activity improves patient outcomes.","Yanagi, Hidetoshi; Konishi, Harumi; Yamada, Saori; Kitagaki, Kazufumi; Nakanishi, Michio; Harada, Taku; Kohzuki, Masahiro",J. rehabil. med,281,16

We hypothesized that chronic antithrombotic therapy could play a protective role in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Retrospective, observational study of all patients admitted to our hospital for &#8805; 24 h from March 1 to May 31, 2020 with SARS-CoV-2. The objective was to evaluate clinical outcomes and mortality in COVID-19 patients receiving chronic anticoagulation (AC) or antiplatelet therapy (AP) prior to hospital admission. A total of 1612 patients were evaluated. The mean (standard deviation; SD) age was 66.5 (17.1) years. Patients were divided into three groups according to the use of antithrombotic therapy prior to admission (AP, AC, or no-antithrombotic treatment). At admission, 9.6% of the patients were taking anticoagulants and 19.1% antiplatelet therapy. The overall mortality rate was 19.3%. On the multivariate analysis there were no significant differences in mortality between the antithrombotic groups (AC or AP) and the no-antithrombotic group (control group). Patients on AC had lower ICU admission rates than the control group (OR: 0.41, 95% CI, 0.18-0.93). Anticoagulation therapy prior to hospitalization for COVID-19 was associated with lower ICU admission rates. However, there were no significant differences in mortality between the patients receiving chronic antithrombotic therapy and patients not taking antithrombotic medications. These findings suggest that chronic anticoagulation therapy at the time of COVID-19 infection may reduce disease severity and thus the need for ICU admission.","Corrochano, Mariana; Acosta-Isaac, René; Mojal, Sergi; Miqueleiz, Sara; Rodriguez, Diana; Quijada-Manuitt, María Ángeles; Fraga, Edmundo; Castillo-Ocaña, Marta; Amaro-Hosey, Kristopher; Albiol, Nil; Soria, José Manuel; Antonijoan, Rosa Maria; Souto, Joan Carles",J. thromb. thrombolysis,281,16

In order for pig production to become less of a threat to the environment, excreta must contain as little P as possible or be efficiently used by plants. This must be achieved without decreasing the livestock performance. Phosphorus and calcium (Ca) deposition in the bones of growing pigs must be optimised without affecting the muscle gain. This requires precision feeding based on cutting-edge techniques of diet formulation throughout the animal growth phase. Modelling and data mining have become important tools in this quest. In this study, a mechanistic model taking into account the distribution of P between bone and soft tissues was compared to the established factorial models (INRA (Jondreville and Dourmad, 2005) and NRC (National Research Council, 2012)) that predict P (apparent total tract digestible, ATTD-P; or standardised total tract digestible, STTD-P) and Ca (total and STTD) requirements as a function of BW and protein deposition. The requirements for different bone mineralisation scenarios, namely, 100% and 85% of the genetic potential, were compared with these two models. Sobol indices were used to estimate the relative impact of growth-related parameters on mineral requirements at 30, 60 and 120 kg of BW. The INRA showed the highest value of ATTD-P requirement between 29 and 103 kg of BW (6%) and lower for lighter and higher BW. Similarly, the model for 85% bone mineralisation showed lower STTD-P requirement than NRC between 29 and 93 kg of BW (7%) and higher for lighter and higher BW. Contrary to other models, the Ca requirement of the proposed model is not fixed in relation to P. It increases from 95 kg of BW while the others decrease. The INRA showed the highest Ca requirements. The model Ca requirements for 100% bone mineralisation are higher than NRC from 20 to 38 kg of BW similar until 70 kg of BW and then higher again. For 85% objective, the model showed lower Ca requirements from 25 to 82 kg of BW and higher for lighter and higher BW. The potential Ca deposition in bones is the most sensitive parameter (84% to 100% of the variance) of both ATTD-P and Ca at 30, 60 and 120 kg. The second most sensitive parameter is the protein deposition, explaining 1% to 15% of the ATTD-P variance. Studies such as this one will help to usher in a new era of sustainable and eco-friendly livestock production.","Lautrou, M; Pomar, C; Dourmad, J-Y; Narcy, A; Schmidely, P; Létourneau-Montminy, M P",Animal,281,20

Learning from failure is important to reach effective quality performance in construction projects. This will, in turn, contribute to the development of the construction industry and the country as a whole. Although quality is an important criterion in project management success, it receives less attention than cost and time in project management literature. Moreover, critical success factors (CSFs) are identified more often than critical failure factors (CFFs) in construction literature. Hence, there is still a lack of attention on critical failure factors affecting quality performance in construction projects. The construction industry is full of uncertainties, especially in the current era of COVID-19 Pandemic. This adds to the necessity of studying critical failure factors in the construction industry. This study aims to identify the critical factors that have an adverse effect on quality performance in construction projects, address their relative importance, and suggest ways to attain good quality performance in construction projects. Based on the literature review, an initial list of failure attributes of quality performance in construction projects was prepared. Then it was refined based on suggestions from experienced professionals in the construction industry in the Jordanian context. A questionnaire was distributed to experts in the construction industry. The responses were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The analyses used here are factor analysis and tests of its appropriateness. Using these analyses, the most critical factors that impede quality performance in construction were identified and ranked.

However, the impact of the crystal phase of TMDs on their performance in photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapy (PTT) remains unclear. Herein, the preparation of ultrasmall single-layer MoS2 nanodots with different phases (1T and 2H phase) is reported to explore their phase-dependent performances as nanoagents for PAI guided PTT in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window. Significantly, the 1T-MoS2 nanodots give a much higher extinction coefficient (25.6 L g-1 cm-1 ) at 1064 nm and subsequent photothermal power conversion efficiency (PCE: 43.3%) than that of the 2H-MoS2 nanodots (extinction coefficient: 5.3 L g-1 cm-1 , PCE: 21.3%). Moreover, the 1T-MoS2 nanodots also give strong PAI signals as compared to negligible signals of 2H-MoS2 nanodots in the NIR-II window. After modification with polyvinylpyrrolidone, the 1T-MoS2 nanodots can be used as a highly efficient agent for PAI guided PTT to effectively ablate cancer cells in vitro and tumors in vivo under 1064 nm laser irradiation. This work proves that the crystal phase plays a key role in determining the performance of nanoagents based on TMD nanomaterials for PAI guided PTT.","Zhou, Zhan; Li, Bowen; Shen, Chuang; Wu, Di; Fan, Huacheng; Zhao, Jiangqi; Li, Hai; Zeng, Zhiyuan; Luo, Zhimin; Ma, Lufang; Tan, Chaoliang",Small,281,21

Therefore, we study the impact of drought on vegetation trends in mainland China, with the aim of discovering the temporal and spatial differences in vegetation dynamics caused by seasonal drought. Our method is based on the use of data from the AVHRR Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from 1983 to 2016 and temperature and precipitation data from Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (NASA's MERRA). Due to the sparse vegetation and low drought, NDVI is the most useful for describing drought conditions in mainland China. The NDVI, TCI, VHI, NVSWI, VCI, TVDI, and NAP from April to October increased rapidly, while the NDVI, TCI, VHI, NVSWI, NAP, TVDI, and VCI are stable every month in September, improve again in October, and then show in December a downward trend. The NDVI, TCI, VHI, NVSWI, NAP, TVDI, and VCI monthly values indicate that mainland China suffered from severe drought in 1984 and 1993, which lasted until 2007, which were the most drought years. For monitoring drought in mainland China, the NDVI, TVDI, NAP, VCI, and NVSWI values were selected as a tool for reporting drought events during different growing seasons. The seasonal values of TVDI, NDVI, NAP, NVSWI, and VCI confirmed that mainland China suffered from severe drought in 1984, 1993, and 2007 and led the durations of severe drought. Spatial correlation is generated between NDVI, TCI, VHI, NVSWI, NAP, TVDI, and VCI. The correlation between NDVI, TCI, VHI, NAP, and VCI showed a significantly positive correlation while significantly negative correlation between NVSWI and TVDI, TVDI and VHI, which showed a good indication for the assessment of drought, especially for the agricultural regions of mainland China. This shows that the positive sign to support NAP, NVSWI, and TVDI is a good monitoring of the drought indices. During the summer, it appears that compared to the southeastern part of mainland China, drought is more likely to occur in the northwestern areas. There is no doubt that these drought indices are comprehensive indicators of monitoring drought events in mainland China.","Ali, Shahzad; Haixing, Zhang; Qi, Ma; Liang, Sun; Ning, Jiang; Jia, Qianmin; Hou, Fujiang",,281,25

CASE PRESENTATION: A 78-year-old male presented to the breast clinic with an abscess and was later diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer. He presented with an abscess and was initially treated with antibiotics. Imaging showed a large left breast mass consistent with inflammatory carcinoma with axillary lymph node involvement. Patient was started on Tamoxifen as a bridge for surgery with no response. He eventually had a mastectomy and axillary clearance with the histology confirming the diagnosis and tumour emboli in the lymphatic vessels. Chemotherapy, radiation and dual hormone therapy were included in the adjuvant treatment plan. Two episodes of neutropenic sepsis led to completing only five out of six planned chemotherapy cycles.

The pathogenesis of COVID-19 remains to be elucidated. We aimed to clarify correlation of systemic inflammation with disease severity and outcomes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, baseline characteristics, laboratory findings, and treatments were compared among 317 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with moderate, severe, or critically ill form of the disease. Moreover, the longitudinal changes of serum cytokines, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and hsCRP to lymphocyte count ratio (hsCRP/L) as well as their associations with disease severity and outcomes were investigated in 68 COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Within 24 h of admission, the critically ill patients showed higher concentrations of inflammatory markers including serum soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;), ferritin, procalcitonin, LDH, hsCRP, and hsCRP/L than patients with severe or moderate disease. The severe cases displayed the similar response patterns when compared with moderate cases. The longitudinal assays showed the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, LDH, hsCRP, and hsCRP/L gradually declined within 10 days post admission in moderate, severe cases or those who survived. However, there was no significant reduction in cytokines, LDH, hsCRP, and hsCRP/L levels in critically ill or deceased patients throughout the course of illness. Compared with female patients, male cases showed higher serum concentrations of soluble IL-2R, IL-6, ferritin, procalcitonin, LDH, and hsCRP. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that IL-6 > 50 pg/mL and LDH > 400 U/L on admission were independently associated with disease severity in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Exuberant inflammatory responses within 24 h of admission in patients with COVID-19 may correlate with disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to elicit a sex-based differential immune response. IL-6 and LDH were independent predictive parameters for assessing the severity of COVID-19. An early decline of these inflammation markers may be associated with better outcomes.","Zeng, Zhilin; Yu, Haijing; Chen, Huilong; Qi, Weipeng; Chen, Liang; Chen, Guang; Yan, Weiming; Chen, Tao; Ning, Qin; Han, Meifang; Wu, Di",Crit Care,281,5

To overcome these issues, we performed a global scale study considering 134,871 virologic-climatic-demographic data (209 countries, first 16 weeks of the pandemic). To analyze the relation among COVID-19, population density, and climate, a theoretical path diagram was hypothesized and tested using structural equation modeling (SEM), a powerful statistical technique for the evaluation of causal assumptions. The results of the analysis showed that both climate and population density significantly influence the spread of COVID-19 (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). Overall, climate outweighs population density (path coefficients: climate vs. incidence = 0.18, climate vs. prevalence = 0.11, population density vs. incidence = 0.04, population density vs. prevalence = 0.05). Among the climatic factors, irradiation plays the most relevant role, with a factor-loading of - 0.77, followed by temperature (- 0.56), humidity (0.52), precipitation (0.44), and pressure (0.073); for all p < 0.001. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that climatic factors significantly influence the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, demographic factors, together with other determinants, can affect the transmission, and their influence may overcome the protective effect of climate, where favourable.","Spada, Alessia; Tucci, Francesco Antonio; Ummarino, Aldo; Ciavarella, Paolo Pio; Calà, Nicholas; Troiano, Vincenzo; Caputo, Michele; Ianzano, Raffaele; Corbo, Silvia; de Biase, Marco; Fascia, Nicola; Forte, Chiara; Gambacorta, Giorgio; Maccione, Gabriele; Prencipe, Giuseppina; Tomaiuolo, Michele; Tucci, Antonio",Sci Rep,281,26

Patient-specific factors can play a role in this observation. Thus, we conducted the present retrospective study to investigate the epidemiologic characteristics of all fatalities resulting from COVID-19 infection in Saudi Arabia as of April 27, 2020. Materials and Methods: The present study was a multicentric, retrospective study that retrieved the data of all confirmed COVID-19-related deaths in Saudi Arabia from March 2 to April 27, 2020. Only records of the cases who underwent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction laboratory tests to confirm the presence of COVID-19 were retrieved. The data of COVID-19 fatalities in Saudi Arabia were obtained from the Health Electronic Surveillance Network of the Ministry of Health. Results: Up to April 27, 2020, 147 cases of COVID-19-related deaths were reported in Saudi Arabia. Almost two-thirds of them were aged above 50 years and majority of them were male (83.7%). Health-care workers represented 3.1% of the dead cases (n = 4 cases). The vast majority of the cases were from Makkah (44.9%) and Madinah (21.8%). Among males, the number of Saudi cases was much lower than non-Saudi cases with 22 and 101 deaths, respectively. Over 80% of the included cases had reported signs and symptoms before death, mainly fever and cough. Out of the 129 cases who had available data regarding comorbidities, 104 cases (80.6%) had one or more comorbidities. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) time from the onset of symptoms till test result confirmation was 5.5 (5) days, while the median (IQR) time from sample collection till test result confirmation was 1 (2) day. On the other hand, the median time from symptom onset till hospitalization and that till death was 1 (3) and 7 (8) days, respectively. Conclusion: COVID-19 is a growing pandemic with unprecedented spread rate and profound impact on the health of specific subsets of affected patients. In the present report, we demonstrated that fatalities from COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia are more common in older age groups, male patients, and non-Saudi residents. Besides, the presence of comorbidities is highly prevalent among fatalities from COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi health-care system has the advantage of fast-track diagnosis, which, in return, could have contributed to the low case fatality rate observed in the Kingdom. Further studies are required to identify the independent predictors of mortality for patients with COVID-19. © 2021 Journal of Nature and Science of Medicine.","Alahmari, A. A.; Alowais, J.; Khan, A.

METHODS: We collated the hospital data for 2019 and 2020 and analyzed and compared it extensively. We looked for the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on several important clinical practice parameters like outpatient attendance, inpatients admissions, and surgery. The correlation of the number of surgeries done during the pandemic time was done with the number of positive cases in Delhi, monthwise. A trend of recovery was also observed. RESULTS: During the pandemic period, the attendance of outpatients fell by 71.93%, admissions by 59.35%, and surgery by 55.78%. Adult trauma surgery was the least affected (42.21%), followed by arthroscopic surgery (49.81%). Fragility hip fractures requiring bipolar hip arthroplasty were reduced by 34.15%.

This area has faced numerous challenges, including the shortage of frequent-use products (hydroalcoholic solutions, lopinavir/ritonavir suspension), the use of new preparations for SARS-CoV-2 (tocilizumab, remdesivir), or requests from overwhelmed wards unable to assume the safe preparation of a high volume of medications (intravenous solutions). The demand for all types of preparations (topic and oral medications, intravenous solutions) has increased dramatically. This increase has highlighted the shortage of resources allocated to this area, which has made it difficult to meet the high demand for preparations. In addition, the pandemic has revealed the scarcity of research on such basic aspects as agent stability and drug compatibility.

The sedentary lifestyle and possible poor nutrition in nursing homes place residents (NHRs) at risk for body composition impairments, malnutrition, and, subsequently, numerous chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to assess body composition (including body fluids) and dietary intake in NHRs. The association between osteosarcopenic adiposity syndrome (OSA) and its components, osteopenic adiposity (OA), sarcopenic adiposity (SA), and adiposity-only (AD), and specific macro- and micro-nutrients was evaluated as well. The study included 84 participants (82.1% women), aged 65.3-95.2 years. Body composition was assessed with an advanced bioelectrical impedance device BIA-ACC® and dietary intake was assessed via 24-h recall and analyzed using ""Nutrition"" software. The majority (95%) of participants were overweight with a high body fat and low muscle and bone mass, leading to a high prevalence of OSA (>50%), OA (13%), and AD (26%). There were only a few participants with SA, and they were not analyzed. The highest extracellular water/total body water ratio was observed in the OSA participants, indicating a heightened inflammatory state. Participants in all three body composition categories had a similar nutrient intake, with protein, fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and almost all micronutrients being far below recommendations. In conclusion, a high prevalence of OSA among NHRs accompanied by a poor dietary intake, could place these residents at a very high risk for COVID-19 infections. Therefore, optimization of body composition and nutritional status should be included along with standard medical care in order to provide better health maintenance, particularly in the COVID-19 era.","Keser, Irena; Cvijetic, Selma; Ilic, Ana; Colic Baric, Irena; Boschiero, Dario; Ilich, Jasminka Z",Nutrients,281,25

This study was performed to investigate the epidemiology of gastrointestinal cancer in Markazi Province. METHODS: This is an epidemiological study in which data was gathered from the population-based cancer registry program in the Markazi province of Iran during the years 2010-2014. Data were recorded in Excel software and coded based on ICD-O. All cases out of Markazi provinces were excluded from study, and cases with code C-15-C20 were included in this study. Stata 11 was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: In this study, 2975 new cases of gastrointestinal cancer in Markazi province were included in the analysis. The highest number of cancers was stomach (with 1595 cases), followed by colorectal cancer (980 cases), esophageal cancer (318 cases), and finally small bowl cancer (82 cases). The mean age of gastro-intestinal cancer diagnosis was 65.07 years. The results showed that with increasing age, the incidence of gastro-intestinal cancers increased, and in all sites and both sexes, the highest incidence of gastro-intestinal cancer was in the age group above 70 years. In both sexes, the age specific rate of stomach cancer was higher than other sites (with highest incidence in 2013) followed by colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, and small bowl cancer.

Published studies on the reduction of SARS-CoV-2-induced cytotoxic effects by mouth rinses do not exclude antiseptic mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity. Here, we determined the effect of commercially available mouth rinses and antiseptic povidone-iodine on the infectivity of replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 viruses and of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viruses. We first determined the effect of mouth rinses on cell viability to ensure that antiviral activity was not a consequence of mouth rinse-induced cytotoxicity. Colgate Peroxyl (hydrogen peroxide) exhibited the most cytotoxicity, followed by povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), and Listerine (essential oils and alcohol). The potent antiviral activities of Colgate Peroxyl mouth rinse and povidone-iodine were the consequence of rinse-mediated cellular damage when the products were present during infection. The potency of CHG was greater when the product was not washed off after virus attachment, suggesting that the prolonged effect of mouth rinses on cells impacts the antiviral outcome. To minimalize mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity, mouth rinse was largely removed from treated viruses by centrifugation prior to infection of cells. A 5% (v/v) dilution of Colgate Peroxyl or povidone-iodine completely blocked viral infectivity. A similar 5% (v/v) dilution of Listerine or CHG had a moderate suppressive effect on the virus, but a 50% (v/v) dilution of Listerine or CHG blocked viral infectivity completely. Mouth rinses inactivated the virus without prolonged incubation. The new infectivity assay, with limited impacts of mouth rinse-associated cytotoxicity, showed the differential effects of mouth rinses on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results indicate that mouth rinses can significantly reduce virus infectivity, suggesting a potential benefit for reducing SARS-CoV-2 spread.","Xu, Chuan; Wang, Annie; Hoskin, Eileen R; Cugini, Carla; Markowitz, Kenneth; Chang, Theresa L; Fine, Daniel H",,281,25

AIM: The aim of this work is to investigate predictive risk factors for 30-day mortality in COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) patients with interstitial pneumonia using patient history, and clinical and laboratory parameters and to develop a nomogram for risk stratification in the emergency department. METHODS: A retrospective, multicenter study was conducted in a cohort of 164 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in the emergency departments of hospitals in Merano and Bressanone from 1 March 2020 to 31 March 2020. Patients were diagnosed as positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using fluorescence reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A nomogram for risk stratification of 30-day mortality of COVID-19 patients was developed based on the parameters studied. RESULTS: In all, 35 (21.3%) of 164 COVID-19 patients with interstitial pneumonia died within 30 days of admission to the emergency department. Multivariate analysis method revealed that cognitive deterioration (odds ratio [OR]: 8.330; pâ¯= 0.004), lymphocytopenia (OR: 4.229; pâ¯= 0.049), renal function deterioration (OR: 4.841; pâ¯= 0.028), peripheral oxygen saturation <â¯93% (OR: 17.871; pâ¯= 0.002), age > 75 years (OR: 2.925; pâ¯= 0.032), elevated C­reactive protein (OR: 6.504; pâ¯= 0.005), low monocyte count (OR: 0.504; pâ¯= 0.004), and comorbidity (OR 5.862; pâ¯= 0.019) were associated with 30-day mortality. Using these eight parameters, a nomogram was developed that showed good discrimination with an area under the ROC curve of 0.937.

Orthopaedic departments have been no exception to this and have needed to adapt to the changing circumstances by releasing resources and focusing on 'essential' activity. The aim of this study is to quantify the reduction in trauma and, in addition, describe any changes in the type of referrals to the trust which may have been affected by the pandemic itself and the social distancing measures employed by the UK government. METHODS: The study was performed in a UK District Hospital which is also a Trauma Unit providing trauma and orthopaedic care to a population of 625,000 people. The trust based electronic database of trauma referrals was used to compare the numbers of, and types of referral to our trauma service during the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding time periods in the previous 3 years. RESULTS: The mean number of referrals per week to the service reduced by 33% in the time period following the confirmation of the outbreak as a pandemic (p<0.0001). Number of operations performed per week reduced by 26% (p = 0.001). There was no change in the number of referrals relating to domestic abuse or non-accidental injury. In addition, numbers of hip fractures, periprosthetic fractures and prosthetic joint dislocations were unchanged. There was a significant reduction in the number of referrals for simple fractures, native joint dislocations, wounds and soft tissue injuries. Within the paediatric population, similarly, a reduction in simple fracture referrals was demonstrated. DISCUSSION: An association between the outbreak of the pandemic and a reduction in referral numbers to our department has been demonstrated. The direct cause of this may be multifactorial but proposing that it is, in part, due to the social distancing measures introduced by the government is certainly conceivable. The patterns of injury would reflect this also with low energy and fragility trauma persisting whilst injuries associated with younger people have reduced. We would suggest that information such as this could be useful in healthcare planning and resource allocation in future pandemic situations.","Murphy, T; Akehurst, H; Mutimer, J",Injury,281,16

Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to clarify eye involvement in COVID-19 in order to help with its diagnosis and to further prevent its transmission. The purpose of this review is to describe the structure and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, reported ocular findings and protection strategies for ophthalmologists. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Literature search on PubMed for relevant articles using the keywords 'COVID-19', 'coronavirus', and 'SARS-CoV-2' in conjunction with 'ophthalmology' and 'eye'. Moreover, official recommendations of ophthalmological societies were reviewed. RESULTS: Although the conjunctiva is directly exposed to extraocular pathogens, and the mucosa of the ocular surface and upper respiratory tract are connected by the nasolacrimal duct, the eye is rarely involved in human SARS-CoV-2 infection and the SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive rate by RT-PCR test in tears and conjunctival secretions from patients with COVID-19 is also extremely low. DISCUSSION: The eye can be affected by SARS-CoV-2, which is supported by some reports of conjunctivitis and retinal changes, but its role in the spread of the disease is still unknown.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was performed according to the PRISMA-DTA guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 2631 oral cavity lesions (AF, n = 2076; CL, n = 555) from 26 studies (AF = 17; CL = 9) was used for calculation of diagnostic accuracy parameters. The overall pooled sensitivity and specificity of the AF were 81.3% (95% CI: 74.3% - 87.5%) and 52.1% (95% CI: 36.9% - 67.1%), respectively. Cumulative diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was 5.44 (95% CI: 2.29 - 10.56) with a significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 80.7%, 95% CI: 70.0% - 86.7%; p < .05). The overall pooled sensitivity and specificity for the CL were 84.9% (95% CI: 66.7% - 96.7%) and 51.8% (95% CI: 37.3% - 65.9%), respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: AF and CL present a high sensitivity in the diagnosis of dysplastic and malignant oral cavity lesions, demonstrating that diagnostic biopsies may be avoided in case of a negative test result. Both tests have a low specificity, and the reduction of the false positive rate compared to the COE alone remains poor.","Moffa, Antonio; Giorgi, Lucrezia; Costantino, Andrea; De Benedetto, Luigi; Cassano, Michele; Spriano, Giuseppe; Mercante, Giuseppe; De Virgilio, Armando; Casale, Manuele",Oral Oncol,281,21

Exercise training is recommended to prevent and alleviate sleep disorders. Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of aerobic exercise training on quality of sleep, psychological wellbeing and immune system among subjects with chronic primary insomnia. Material and methods: Eighty previously sedentary subjects with chronic primary insomnia subjects enrolled in this study, their age ranged from 35-56 years. All participants were randomly assigned to supervised aerobic exercise intervention group (group A, n=40) or control group (group B, n=40). Polysomnographic recordings for sleep quality assessment, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Profile of Mood States(POMS), Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), number of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells count and CD4/CD8 ratio were measured before and at the end of the study after six months. Results: There was a significant increase in the total sleep duration, sleep efficiency and sleep onset latency in group(A) after six months of aerobic exercise training, while, wake time after sleep onset and rapid eye movement (REM) latency significantly reduced after six months of aerobic training compared with values obtained prior to aerobic exercise training. Also, the mean values of BDI, POMS, CD3 count, CD4 count and CD8 count decreased significantly and the mean value of RSES significantly increased in group (A) after the aerobic exercise training, while the results of the control group were not significant. Moreover, there were significant differences between both groups at the end of the study. Conclusion: Exercise training can be considered as a non-pharmacological modalty for modifying sleep quality, psychological wellbeing and immune system among subjects with chronic primary insomnia.","Abd El-Kader, Shehab M; Al-Jiffri, Osama H",Afr Health Sci,281,24

The median age was 40 years (SD ± 15 years); there was an equal number of men and women; all the patients but one were coming from abroad; the most common symptom was fever (24/26 cases) and lymphopenia (n = 8). We found that there were patients in whom fever disappeared within the first 72h (n = 17) and another group in which the fever lasted six or more days (n = 7). One patient out of 26 died. The population of our study was young and almost all were imported cases, in alinement with the stage of the epidemic at the time when the study was conducted.

In such dire straits there tends to be a shortage of certain knowledge and an abundance of speculations that can potentially inform as well as misinform the public. In this study, we conduct a conversation analysis of the interactional dynamics of speculations between Danish journalists and health experts in televised news interviews and press conferences during the initial phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020. The analysis shows how journalists and experts construct and moderate speculations interactionally by entering both convergent and divergent roles. In conclusion, the potentials and pitfalls of such speculations are discussed, and implications are suggested for journalism practice.

We hypothesize that short term (daily) temperature fluctuation will alleviate nutrient limitation. We carried out experiments analysing growth rates, phosphorus and RNA content of D. commutate grown under four different temperature regimes and two P-limited conditions. Our experiments showed that individuals grown under fluctuating temperature grew more than at the mean temperature. We estimated the expected sizes for the 15 °C treatment based on the Q10 and for the fluctuating temperature treatment. These expected sizes for both treatments resulted well below the observed ones. The P and RNA content of individuals grown at 10 °C were significantly higher than those at 20 °C, and when individuals grown at 10 °C were translocated to 20 °C they exerted an increased growth rate. Our results suggest that, under a regime of diel vertical migration, the temperature alternation would allow migrating organisms to alleviate the effect of severe nutrient limitation maintaining population growth. Under a scenario of global warming, where epilimnetic temperatures will increase, lake temperature will interact with nutrient limitation for consumers, but, organisms may be able to face these changes if they can still regularly move from a cold hypolimnion to a warmer epilimnion.","Balseiro, Esteban; Laspoumaderes, Cecilia; Smufer, Facundo; Wolinski, Laura; Modenutti, Beatriz",Sci Rep,281,20

Using a large survey, we find the number of correct beliefs held by individuals far dwarfs the number of misperceptions. When it comes to misperceptions, we find that minorities, those with high levels of religiosity, and those with strong partisan identities – across parties – hold a substantially greater number of misperceptions than those with contrasting group affiliations. Moreover, we show other variables (e.g., social media usage, number of COVID-19 cases in one’s county) do not have such strong relationships with misperceptions, and the group-level results do not reflect acquiescence to believing any information regardless of its truth value. Our results accentuate the importance of studying group-level misperceptions on other scientific and political issues and developing targeted interventions for these groups.","Druckman, James N.; Ognyanova, Katherine Baum Matthew A.; Lazer, David Perlis Roy H.; Volpe, John Della Santillana Mauricio Hanyu Chwe Quintana Alexi Simonson Matthew",Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations,281,1

We conducted a single-center, retrospective, cohort study to investigate the relationship between serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM and clinical outcomes in severe/critical patients with COVID-19. Seventy-nine severe/critical patients with COVID-19 admitted in Wuhan Asia General Hospital in Wuhan, China during January 22, 2020 to March 6, 2020 were included. Serum antibodies were measured at day 25 (SD, 7) post illness onset. The median IgG titer was 113 (IQR 81-167) AU/ml, and IgM titer was 50 (IQR, 23-105) AU/ml. Patients whose IgM titer &#8805; 50 AU/ml had higher in-hospital mortality (p=0.026). IgM titer &#8805; 50 AU/ml was also correlated with higher incidences of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis shock. Antibody remeasurements were performed in 42 patients, where IgM titer declined significantly in survivors (p=0.031). Serum IgM titer changes according to the COVID-19 progression. The severe/critical patients with COVID-19 have a higher risk of clinical adverse events when IgM titer &#8805; 50 AU/ml. Further decreasing of IgM could imply a better outcome in severe/critical cases.","Liu, Xintian; Zheng, Xuan; Liu, Bo; Wu, Mingxiang; Zhang, Zhenlu; Zhang, Gangcheng; Su, Xi",Aging (Albany NY),281,10

This article aims to define the changes needed to operate an academic otolaryngology practice safely and efficiently from within the epicenter of the pandemic. We define the areas of normal patient workflow that have been affected by COVID-19, and we offer mitigation strategies with attention paid to the specific needs of subspecialties. DATA SOURCES: The article includes data specific to the office practice metrics of the Weill Cornell Medicine Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, as well as publically available data from New York Presbyterian Hospital system and the New York Times. REVIEW METHODS: Expert opinion. CONCLUSIONS: Through careful planning and execution, it is possible to reestablish safe otolaryngologic patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic. It will require a significant change from prior practice models for successful implementation. Additionally, telemedicine can be positively integrated into the treatment of otolaryngology diseases for new and established patients. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The information conveyed in this review can be used as a guide by large and small otolaryngology groups to identify aspects of the patient visit that are ""at risk"" due to COVID-19, and it suggests sensible responses that can be made without a significant disruption to normal practice. The methods used to identify vulnerabilities with the patient visit process can be applied to future unforeseen crises, such as a resurgence of COVID-19 or a novel pandemic.","Pearlman, Aaron N; Tabaee, Abtin; Sclafani, Anthony P; Sulica, Lucian; Selesnick, Samuel H; Kutler, David I; Montano, Joseph J; Levinger, Joshua I; Suurna, Maria V; Modi, Vikash K; Stewart, Michael G",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,281,7

Nevertheless, there are some predicted and unpredicted problems that epidemic diseases are real and complex problems. Hence, in this research work, a serious challenge in the sustainable development process was investigated using the classification of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (new version of Coronavirus) as one of the epidemic diseases. Hence, binary classification modeling was used by the group method of data handling (GMDH) type of neural network as one of the artificial intelligence methods. For this purpose, the Hubei province in China was selected as a case study to construct the proposed model, and some important factors, namely maximum, minimum, and average daily temperature, the density of a city, relative humidity, and wind speed, were considered as the input dataset, and the number of confirmed cases was selected as the output dataset for 30 days. The proposed binary classification model provides higher performance capacity in predicting the confirmed cases. In addition, regression analysis has been done and the trend of confirmed cases compared with the fluctuations of daily weather parameters (wind, humidity, and average temperature). The results demonstrated that the relative humidity and maximum daily temperature had the highest impact on the confirmed cases. The relative humidity in the main case study, with an average of 77.9%, affected positively, and maximum daily temperature, with an average of 15.4 ◦C, affected negatively, the confirmed cases.","Pirouz, Behrouz; Haghshenas, Sina Shaffiee; Haghshenas, Sami Shaffiee; Piro, Patrizia",Sustainability,281,6

While elective activity has halted across the board nationally, the slow plateau of COVID-19 case rates prompts the question of timing of resumption of clinical activity. We sought to prospectively predict geographical ""hot zones"" for otolaryngological exposure to COVID-19 based on procedural volumes data from 2013 to 2017. METHODS: Otolaryngologic CPT codes were stratified based on risk-level, according to recently published specialty-specific guidelines. Using the Medicare POSPUF database, aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) were mapped based on hospital referral regions, against up-to-date COVID-19 case distribution data, as of April 24, 2020. RESULTS: The most common AGPs were diagnostic flexible laryngoscopy, diagnostic nasal endoscopy, and flexible laryngoscopy with stroboscopy. The regions with the most AGPs per otolaryngologist were Iowa City, IA, Detroit, MI, and Burlington, VT, while the states with the most COVID-19 cases as of April 24th are New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a model for predicting possible ""hot zones"" for otolaryngologic exposure based on both COVID-19 case density and AGP-density. As the focus shifts to resuming elective procedures, these potential ""hot zones"" need to be evaluated for appropriate risk-based decision-making, such as ""reopening strategies"" and allocation of resources.","Quereshy, Humzah A; Jella, Tarun K; Ruthberg, Jeremy S; Kocharyan, Armine; D039,; Anza, Brian; Maronian, Nicole; Otteson, Todd D",Am J Otolaryngol,281,16

Trust, important in all patient-provider relationships, is difficult to build in such communities, particularly when stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and now COVID-19, is widespread. CHWs, responsible for bringing people back into care, must repair trust. In South Africa, where a national CHW programme is being rolled out, marginalised communities have high levels of unemployment, domestic violence and injury. OBJECTIVES: In this complex social environment, we explored CHW workplace trust, interpersonal trust between the patient and CHW, and the institutional trust patients place in the health system. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS, SETTING: Within the observation phase of a 3-year intervention study, we conducted interviews, focus groups and observations with patients, CHWs, their supervisors and, facility managers in Sedibeng. RESULTS: CHWs had low levels of workplace trust. They had recently been on strike demanding better pay, employment conditions and recognition of their work. They did not have the equipment to perform their work safely, and some colleagues did not trust, or value, their contribution. There was considerable interpersonal trust between CHWs and patients, however, CHWs' efforts were hampered by structural poverty, alcohol abuse and no identification documents among long-term migrants. Those supervisors who understood the extent of the poverty supported CHW efforts to help the community. When patients had withdrawn from care, often due to nurses' insensitive behaviour, the CHWs' attempts to repair patients' institutional trust often failed due to the vulnerabilities of the community, and lack of support from the health system. CONCLUSION: Strategies are needed to build workplace trust including supportive supervision for CHWs and better working conditions, and to build interpersonal and institutional trust by ensuring sensitivity to social inequalities and the effects of structural poverty among healthcare providers. Societies need to care for everyone.","Anstey Watkins, Jocelyn; Griffiths, Frances; Goudge, Jane",BMJ Open,281,30

In dense urban environments, this is partially caused by inherent inefficiencies due to traffic congestion and the disparity and accessibility of customer locations. In parcel logistics, access hubs are facilities supporting relay-based last-mile activities by offering temporary storage locations enabling the decoupling of last-mile activities from the rest of the urban distribution chain. This paper focuses on a novel tactical problem: the geographically dynamic deployment of pooled relocatable storage capacity modules in an urban parcel network operating under space-time uncertainty. In particular, it proposes a two-stage stochastic optimization model for the access hub dynamic pooled capacity deployment problem with synchronization of underlying operations through travel time estimates, and a solution approach based on a rolling horizon algorithm with lookahead and a benders decomposition able to solve large scale instances of a real-sized megacity. Numerical results, inspired by the case of a large parcel express carrier, are provided to evaluate the computational performance of the proposed approach and suggest up to 28% last-mile cost savings and 26% capacity savings compared to a static capacity deployment strategy.","Faugere, Louis; Klibi, Walid; White, Chelsea; Montreuil, Benoit",,281,16

However, they have not issued any guidelines for the safe establishment and operation of an HMB. This gap contributes to the demand for gathering experiences from HMB networks, especially those from lower-middle income countries. To fill this knowledge gap, this study examines the characteristics of donors, donation, pasteurization, and recipients during the first four years of operation in the first HMB in Vietnam. METHODS: Data about the donors, donation, pasteurization, and recipients were extracted from the web-based electronic monitoring system of the HMB from 1 February 2017 to 31 January 2021. RESULTS: In the first four years of operation there were 433 donors who donated 7642 L of milk (66% from the community) with an increased trend in the amount of donated milk, donation duration, and average amount of milk donated by a donor. Approximately 98% of the donated milk was pasteurized, and 82% passed both pre- and post-pasteurization tests. Although the pass rate tended to increase with time, a few dips occurred. Of 16,235 newborns who received pasteurized donor milk, two thirds were in the postnatal wards. The main reason for the prescription of pasteurized donor milk was insufficient mothers' own milk in the first few days after birth. There was a decreased trend in the amount and duration of using pasteurized donor milk in both postnatal wards and the neonatal unit. CONCLUSIONS: The HMB has operated efficiently in the previous four years, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, to serve vulnerable newborns. Ongoing evidence-based adjustments helped to improve the operation to recruit suitable donors, to increase the access to and quality of raw donor milk, to improve the pasteurization process, and to meet the need of more newborns.","Tran, Hoang Thi; Nguyen, Tuan Thanh; Barnett, Debbie; Weaver, Gillian; Nguyen, Oanh Thi Xuan; Van Ngo, Quang; Le, Huong Thi Thanh; Huynh, Le Thi; Do, Chung Thi; Mathisen, Roger",Nutrients,281,1

An ongoing pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19 appears to present with 3 major patterns of clinical symptomatology: (1) mild upper respiratory tract infection, (2) non-life-threatening pneumonia, and (3) severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome that initially manifest as a mild prodrome lasting for 7-8 days before rapid clinical and radiological deterioration requiring ICU transfer. RRx-001 is a targeted nitric oxide donor. This small molecule, which has been evaluated in multiple Phase 1-2 clinical trials for cancer as well as a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of small cell lung cancer called REPLATINUM (NCT03699956), is minimally toxic and demonstrates clear evidence of antitumor activity. During the course of these clinical trials it was noted that the rate of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and pneumonia in actively smoking small cell lung cancer patients treated with RRx-001 is less than 1%. Due to extensive history of tobacco use, 40%-70% of patients with lung cancer have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the expected rate of pulmonary infection in this population is 50%-70%, which was not observed in RRx-001 clinical trials. Moreover, in preclinical studies of pulmonary hypertension, RRx-001 was found to be comparable with or more effective than the FDA approved agent, Bosentan. The potential pulmonary protective effects of RRx-001 in patients with recurrent lung infections coupled with preclinical models demonstrating RRx-001-mediated reversal of pulmonary hypertension suggests RRx-001 may have therapeutic activity in patients with acute respiratory symptoms due to COVID 19. Clinical trials have been initiated to confirm the hypothesis that RRx-001 may be repurposed to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Oronsky, Bryan; Knox, Susan; Cabrales, Pedro; Oronsky, Arnold; Reid, Tony R",Semin Oncol,281,5

Further, effects of using two different routes of infection of Streptococcus agalactiae; intraperitoneal injection (IP) and cohabitation with the shedder fish (cohab), on the genomic parameters, prediction accuracy and response to selection are compared. The comparison was made between two different lines of fish; one selected for S. agalactiae resistance for one generation and randomly mated for two generations (to mimic the multiplication activities occurring in distribution channels and hatcheries); and the other unselected. 1,500 fish, each from these two lines, were used for the experimental challenge test. Survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier estimators and Hazard's ratio was used to quantify differences in mortality between the two lines. Further genomic analysis was performed with 2,684 fish and 35,745 SNPs using both univariate and bivariate GBLUP models. Genetic selection for resistance to S. agalactiae led to the significant (p < .001) reduction in the risk of death by 65% in the selected line, compared to the unselected line. Similarly, the risk of death via cohabitation route of infection significantly (p < .01) decreased by 80%, compared to IP. The genetic correlation between these two routes of infection was ~0.9. Genetic selection changed the impact of the routes of infection, with the change in the distribution of estimated breeding values and the gain of 3.04 ± 1.25 days as selection response (p < .05).","Joshi, Rajesh; Skaaurd, Anders; Tola Alvarez, Alejandro",,281,16

These patients present symptoms that make food intake and nutrient absorption difficult, therefore involving nutritional risk. On the other hand, acute respiratory complications require prolonged ICU stays, and this predisposes to increased malnutrition and loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, which can lead to poor quality of life, disability and morbidity long after discharge. For this reason, the world's leading nutrition societies and associations believe that nutritional therapy should be considered a part of the basic treatment of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: we have reviewed and compared 9 expert recommendations (ER) published by nutrition societies and associations from China, Spain, Brazil, Europe, Colombia, Australia, America, and the United Kingdom, in relation to critical and non-critical hospitalized patients due to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: the 9 ERs reviewed agree on the importance of nutritional management in critical and non-critical hospitalized patients with COVID-19, as well as on the early detection of nutritional risk, the intervention, and subsequent follow-up. Even so, each published document has its own particularities and puts a special stress on some specific aspect.","Martínez Rodríguez, Jéssica; Roca Fontbona, María",Nutr. hosp,281,16

It has furthermore been suggested that less-developed countries are particularly affected by this pandemic. Empirical evidence for this is lacking. METHODS: Based on a dataset covering 170 countries, patterns of empirical 7-d reproductive ratios during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic were analysed. Time trends and associations with socio-economic development indicators, such as gross domestic product per capita, physicians per population, extreme poverty prevalence and maternal mortality ratio, were analysed in mixed linear regression models using log-transformed reproductive ratios as the dependent variable. RESULTS: Reproductive ratios during the early phase of a pandemic exhibited high fluctuations and overall strong declines. Stable estimates were observed only several weeks into the pandemic, with a median reproductive ratio of 0.96 (interquartile range 0.72-1.34) 6 weeks into the analysis period. Unfavourable socio-economic indicators showed consistent associations with higher reproductive ratios, which were elevated by a factor of 1.29 (95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.46), for example, in the countries in the highest compared with the lowest tertile of extreme poverty prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has allowed for the first time description of the global patterns of reproductive ratios of a novel pathogen during pandemic spread. The present study reports the first quantitative empirical evidence that COVID-19 net transmissibility remains less controlled in socio-economically disadvantaged countries, even months into the pandemic. This needs to be addressed by the global scientific community as well as international politics.","Breitling, Lutz P",International health (Online),281,23

The methods used include the derivation of the Pandemic Equation describing the mitigation measures via the evolution of the growth time constant in the Pandemic Equation resulting in an asymmetric pandemic curve with a steeper rise than a decrease and mitigation measures. The Pandemic Equation predicts how the quarantine removal and business opening lead to a spike in the pandemic curve. The effective vaccination reduces the new daily infections predicted by the Pandemic Equation. The pandemic curves in many localities have similar time dependencies but shifted in time. The Pandemic Equation parameters extracted from the well advanced pandemic curves can be used for predicting the pandemic evolution in the localities, where the pandemics is still in the initial stages. Using the multiple pandemic locations for the parameter extraction allows for the uncertainty quantification in predicting the pandemic evolution using the introduced Pandemic Equation. Compared with other pandemic models our approach allows for easier parameter extraction amenable to using Artificial Intelligence models.","Shur, Michael",J Healthc Inform Res,281,1

We aimed to compare the national impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the risk of death in UK patients with cancer versus those in continental EU. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the OnCovid study database, a European registry of patients with cancer consecutively diagnosed with COVID-19 in 27 centres from 27th February to 10th September 2020. We analysed case fatality rates and risk of death at 30 days and 6 months stratified by region of origin (UK versus EU). We compared patient characteristics at baseline including oncological and COVID-19-specific therapy across UK and EU cohorts and evaluated the association of these factors with the risk of adverse outcomes in multivariable Cox regression models. FINDINGS: Compared with EU (n = 924), UK patients (n = 468) were characterised by higher case fatality rates (40.38% versus 26.5%, p < 0.0001) and higher risk of death at 30 days (hazard ratio [HR], 1.64 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.36-1.99]) and 6 months after COVID-19 diagnosis (47.64% versus 33.33%; p < 0.0001; HR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.33-1.88]). UK patients were more often men, were of older age and have more comorbidities than EU counterparts (p < 0.01). Receipt of anticancer therapy was lower in UK than in EU patients (p < 0.001). Despite equal proportions of complicated COVID-19, rates of intensive care admission and use of mechanical ventilation, UK patients with cancer were less likely to receive anti-COVID-19 therapies including corticosteroids, antivirals and interleukin-6 antagonists (p < 0.0001).

Our goal was to determine the content of provider communication resources and peer-reviewed articles on COVID-19 communication in order to identify opportunities for developing future COVID-19 communication curricula and support tools. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using the UpToDate clinical decision support resource database, CINAHL, PubMed, PsycInfo, and Web of Science. The grey literature review was conducted in September 2020 and articles published between January-September 2020 written in English were included. RESULTS: A total of 89 sources were included in the review, (n = 36 provider communication resources, n = 53 peer-reviewed articles). Resources were available for all providers, mainly physicians, and consisted of general approaches to COVID-19 communication with care planning as the most common topic. Only four resources met best practices for patient-centered communication. All but three articles described physician communication where a general emphasis on patient communication was the most prevalent topic. Reduced communication channels, absence of family, time, burnout, telemedicine, and reduced patient-centered care were identified as communication barriers. Communication facilitators were team communication, time, patient-centered and family communication, and available training resources. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, resources lack content that address non-physician providers, communication with family, and strategies for telehealth communication to promote family engagement. The gaps identified in this review reveal a need to develop more materials on the following topics: provider moral distress, prevention communication, empathy and compassion, and grief and bereavement.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of 162 Spanish women. They were divided into two groups: those who gave birth before the pandemic (n = 82; from September 1, 2019 to March 1, 2020) and during the pandemic (n = 75; from April 1, 2020 to July 1, 2020). They were assessed using psychological instruments for postpartum childbirth satisfaction and postpartum depression. RESULTS: It was found that women who gave birth during the pandemic suffered higher levels of stress during childbirth (U = 2652.50; P = 0.040) and gave a worse rating of the quality of care received (U = 2703.50; P = 0.041). In addition, the percentage of postpartum depression was much higher in women who gave birth during the pandemic (&#967;2 = 4.31; P = 0.038). CONCLUSION: Giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic could have an impact on greater dissatisfaction with childbirth, as well as increasing the risk of postpartum depression.","Mariño-Narvaez, Carolina; Puertas-Gonzalez, Jose A; Romero-Gonzalez, Borja; Peralta-Ramirez, Maria Isabel",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,281,5

Also, we propose an optimal strategy to implement the optimal campaigns through the use of awareness campaigns in region j that aims at protecting individuals from being infected by the virus, security campaigns and health measures to prevent the movement of individuals from one region to another, encouraging the individuals to join quarantine centers and the disposal of infected animals. The aim is to maximize the number of individuals subjected to quarantine and trying to reduce the number of the infected individuals and the infected animals. Pontryagin's maximum principle in discrete time is used to characterize the optimal controls and the optimality system is solved by an iterative method. The numerical simulation is carried out using Matlab. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio was calculated to investigate the cost-effectiveness of all possible combinations of the four control measures. Using cost-effectiveness analysis, we show that control of protecting susceptible individuals, preventing their contact with the infected individuals and encouraging the exposed individuals to join quarantine centers provides the most cost-effective strategy to control the disease.","Khajji, Bouchaib; Kada, Driss; Balatif, Omar; Rachik, Mostafa",J Appl Math Comput,281,1

Shaare Zedek (SZ), a 1000-bed tertiary care medical centre in Jerusalem, Israel, cared for a significant number of these patients. While attention focused on COVID-19 patients, uninfected patients were admitted to decreasing numbers of available internal medicine (IM) beds as IM departments were converted to COVID-19 isolation wards. As a result of the increase in COVID-19 patients, closure of IM wards, re-assignment of staff and dynamic changes in available community placement options, we investigated the impact of the outbreak on IM patient not admitted for COVID-19. METHODS: We reviewed IM admissions during March 15-April 30, 2020 for patients without COVID-19. Characteristics assessed included number of admissions, age, length of stay, mortality rate, number of discharges, number discharged home and functional status of the patients. Data were compared with the previous 3 years (2017-2019) during the same time period. RESULTS: During March 15-April 30, 2020 there were 409 patients admitted to IM compared with a mean of 557 over the previous 3 years. Fewer patients were admitted to the ED and the IM wards during the outbreak. There was no significant difference between the two groups with regards to gender, in-hospital mortality rate, number discharged, number discharged home and patient functional level. Patients admitted during the outbreak to IM were younger (74.85 vs 76.86 years) and had a mean shorter hospital length of stay (5.12 vs 7.63 days) compared with the previous 3 years. CONCLUSION: While the characteristics of patients admitted to IM during the outbreak were similar, hospital length of stay was significantly shorter. Internal management processes, as well as patient preferences may have contributed to this observation. An infectious disease outbreak may have a significant effect on uninfected admitted patients.","Mendlovic, Joseph; Weiss, Gali; Da039,; as, Nael; Yinnon, Amos; Katz, David E",Int J Clin Pract,281,22

We then generated isogenic ApoE3/3 and ApoE4/4 hiPSCs and found an increased rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ApoE4/4 neurons and astrocytes. ApoE4 astrocytes exhibited enlarged size and elevated nuclear fragmentation upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we show that remdesivir treatment inhibits SARS-CoV2 infection of hiPSC neurons and astrocytes. These findings suggest that ApoE4 may play a causal role in COVID-19 severity.

The panel of evaluation consisted of 94 samples: 69 positive and 25 negative for SARS-CoV-2 by reference RT-PCR. Three extraction-free RT-PCR assays were assessed: (i) PrimeDirect® Probe RT-qPCR Mix (Takara), (ii) PrimeScript®RT-PCR (Takara), and (iii) SARS-CoV-2 SANSURE®BIOTECH Novel Coronavirus (Sansure). The overall sensitivity of PrimeDirect, PrimeScript and Sansure assays was 55.1 %, 69.6 % and 69.6 %, respectively. The sensitivity increased among samples with Ct<30: 91.9 % (n = 34/37), 89.2 % (n = 33/37) and 94.6 % (n = 35/37) for PrimeDirect, PrimeScript and Sansure assays, respectively.

As of November 18, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has claimed more than 1,342,709 lives, with a global mortality rate of ~2.4% and a recovery rate of ~69.6%. Understanding the interaction of cellular targets with the SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for therapeutic development. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of transcriptomic signatures of infection of SARS-CoV-2 compared to other respiratory viruses (EBOV, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV), to determine a unique anti-SARS-CoV-2 gene signature. We identified for the first time that molecular pathways for heparin-binding, RAGE, miRNA, and PLA2 inhibitors were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The NRCAM and SAA2 genes, which are involved in severe inflammatory responses, and the FGF1 and FOXO1 genes, which are associated with immune regulation, were found to be associated with the cellular gene response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, several cytokines, most significantly IL-8 and IL-6, demonstrated key associations with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, the only response gene that was shared among the five viral infections was SERPINB1. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis shed light on genes with high interaction activity that SARS-CoV-2 shares with other viral infections. The findings showed that the genetic pathways associated with rheumatoid arthritis, the AGE-RAGE signaling system, malaria, hepatitis B, and influenza A were of high significance. We found that the virogenomic transcriptome of infection, gene modulation of host antiviral responses, and GO terms of SARS-CoV-2 and EBOV were more similar than to SARS, H1N1, and MERS. This work compares the virogenomic signatures of highly pathogenic viruses and provides valid targets for potential therapy against SARS-CoV-2.","Alsamman, Alsamman M; Zayed, Hatem",PLoS One,281,16

DATA SOURCES: n/a METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: A literature review using key Medical Subject Headings terms was performed-according to methods described by the Cochrane Collaboration and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines-on studies that described enhanced recovery and coronavirus disease (COVID-19). TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Modifications to our existing ERPs related to the COVID-19 pandemic should include new accommodations for patient education, preoperative COVID-19 testing, prehabilitation, and intraoperative infection as well as thromboembolism risk reduction. CONCLUSION: ERPs are evidence-based, best practice guidelines applied across the perioperative continuum to mitigate surgical stress, decrease complications, and accelerate recovery. These benefits are part of the high-value-care equation needed to solve the clinical, operational, and financial challenges of the current COVID-19 pandemic. The factors driving outcomes on ERPs, such as the provision of minimally invasive surgery, warrant careful consideration. Tracking patient outcomes and improving care in response to outcomes data are key to the success of clinical care protocols such as ERPs. Numerous emerging clinical registries and reporting systems have been activated to provide outcomes data on the impact of COVID-19. This will inform and change surgical practice as well as provide opportunity to learn if the advantages that surgeons, patients, and the healthcare system might gain from using ERPs during a pandemic are meaningful.","Stone, Rebecca; Scheib, Stacey",J. minim. invasive gynecol,281,21

The requirement to reassign space has created challenges for obstetric services. We describe the nature of that challenge for an obstetric service in New York City. This experience raised an ethical challenge: whether it would be consistent with professional integrity to respond to a public health emergency with a plan for obstetric services that would create an increased risk of rare maternal mortality. We answered this question using the conceptual tools of professional ethics in obstetrics, especially the professional virtue of integrity. A public health emergency requires frameshifting from an individual-patient perspective to a population-based perspective. We show that an individual-patient-based, beneficence-based deliberative clinical judgment is not an adequate basis for organizational policy in response to a public health emergency. Instead, physicians, especially those in leadership positions, must frameshift to population-based clinical ethical judgment that focuses on reduction of mortality as much as possible in the entire population of patients served by a healthcare organization.","Chervenak, Frank A; Grünebaum, Amos; Bornstein, Eran; Wasden, Shane; Katz, Adi; Rochelson, Burton L; McCullough, Laurence B",J Perinat Med,281,21

It is likely that for the immediate future, young children will continue to experience emotional and psychological stress. A curriculum that does not take into consideration a pandemic of the scale we are witnessing today creates unnecessary pressure and anxiety not just on young children but also on the adults who care for and teach them.

This has prompted researchers to seek specific novel and definitive treatments urgently. In this context, it is interesting to evaluate the preventive and therapeutic effects of existing pharmacological agents that could be useful. In this regard, vitamin D supplementation, particularly in individuals likely to be deficient, may be a promising option. Vitamin D is a hormone that modulates many of the same inflammatory and oxidative signaling pathways triggered during COVID-19. For example, vitamin D suppresses the actions of the renin-angiotensin system, which has a determining role in the pathophysiology of the inflammatory response related to COVID-19. This paper analyzes the evidence that vitamin D supplementation might be a valuable preventive/therapeutic measure in groups at risk of or infected with COVID-19. It also discusses how clinical studies could be best designed to evaluate the possible advantages of vitamin D supplementation for the benefit of public health during the pandemic.","Ferder, Leon; Martín Giménez, Virna Margarita; Inserra, Felipe; Tajer, Carlos; Antonietti, Laura; Mariani, Javier; Manucha, Walter",,281,16

Objective: To evaluate the risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among HCP with the a priori hypothesis that community exposure but not health care exposure was associated with seropositivity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study was conducted among volunteer HCP at 4 large health care systems in 3 US states. Sites shared deidentified data sets, including previously collected serology results, questionnaire results on community and workplace exposures at the time of serology, and 3-digit residential zip code prefix of HCP. Site-specific responses were mapped to a common metadata set. Residential weekly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cumulative incidence was calculated from state-based COVID-19 case and census data. Exposures: Model variables included demographic (age, race, sex, ethnicity), community (known COVID-19 contact, COVID-19 cumulative incidence by 3-digit zip code prefix), and health care (workplace, job role, COVID-19 patient contact) factors. Main Outcome and Measures: The main outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Risk factors for seropositivity were estimated using a mixed-effects logistic regression model with a random intercept to account for clustering by site. Results: Among 24â¯749 HCP, most were younger than 50 years (17â¯233 [69.6%]), were women (19â¯361 [78.2%]), were White individuals (15â¯157 [61.2%]), and reported workplace contact with patients with COVID-19 (12â¯413 [50.2%]). Many HCP worked in the inpatient setting (8893 [35.9%]) and were nurses (7830 [31.6%]). Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 per 10â¯000 in the community up to 1 week prior to serology testing ranged from 8.2 to 275.6; 20â¯072 HCP (81.1%) reported no COVID-19 contact in the community. Seropositivity was 4.4% (95% CI, 4.1%-4.6%; 1080 HCP) overall. In multivariable analysis, community COVID-19 contact and community COVID-19 cumulative incidence were associated with seropositivity (community contact: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.5; 95% CI, 2.9-4.1; community cumulative incidence: aOR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.3-2.6). No assessed workplace factors were associated with seropositivity, including nurse job role (aOR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-1.3), working in the emergency department (aOR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.8-1.3), or workplace contact with patients with COVID-19 (aOR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-1.3). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of US HCP in 3 states, community exposures were associated with seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2, but workplace factors, including workplace role, environment, or contact with patients with known COVID-19, were not. These findings provide reassurance that current infection prevention practices in diverse health care settings are effective in preventing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from patients to HCP.","Jacob, Jesse T; Baker, Julia M; Fridkin, Scott K; Lopman, Benjamin A; Steinberg, James P; Christenson, Robert H; King, Brent; Leekha, Surbhi; O039,; Hara, Lyndsay M; Rock, Peter; Schrank, Gregory M; Hayden, Mary K; Hota, Bala; Lin, Michael Y; Stein, Brian D; Caturegli, Patrizio; Milstone, Aaron M; Rock, Clare; Voskertchian, Annie; Reddy, Sujan C; Harris, Anthony D",JAMA Netw Open,281,24

This retrospective, two-centre study was conducted between 2000 and 2009. Data on patients with VO were retrieved from the diagnosis database and confirmed by checking medical records. A total of 300 patients with VO were identified; 31 received antibiotics without bacteriological diagnosis, and 269 patients with spondylodiscitis imaging were included. Eighty-three (30.9%) and 18 (6.7%) infections were documented by blood cultures and by bacteriological samples other than PNB, respectively; 168 patients with no bacteriological diagnosis had PNB. Of these, 92 (54.8%) were positive and identified the pathogen and 76 (45.2%) were negative. The most common bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (34.3%), Streptococcus spp. (20.6%) and coagulase-negative staphylococcus (14.8%). After multivariate analysis, the only factor associated with negative PNB was previous antibiotic intake (OR: 2.31 [1.07-5.00]). When VO was suspected on imaging, bacteriological investigation identified the microorganism in 209/300 (70%) of the cases. The yield of PNB was 54.8%. The only predictor of PNB negativity was previous antibiotic intake. Therefore, we believe that a second PNB should be done after a sufficient delay withdrawal of antibiotics if the first sample was negative.

A reliable classification is crucial to ensure a high level of protection, and at the same time to prevent many people from being sent to quarantine by the app. Tracing apps are based on the capabilities of current smartphones to enable a broadest possible availability. Existing capabilities of smartphones include the exchange of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals and of audio signals, as well as the use of gyroscopes and magnetic sensors. The Bluetooth power measurements, which are often used today, may be complemented by audio ranging and attitude estimation in the future. Smartphones are worn in different ways, often in pockets and bags, which makes the propagation of signals and thus the classification rather unpredictable. Relying on the cooperation of users to wear their phones hanging from their neck would change the situation considerably. In this case the performance, achievable with BLE and audio measurements, becomes predictable. Our analysis identifies parameters that result in accurate warnings, at least within the scope of validity of the models. A significant reduction of the spreading of the disease can then be achieved by the apps, without causing many people to unduly go to quarantine.

It is unclear whether this is attributable to age or attendant age-associated risk factors. This retrospective cohort study aims to characterize hospitalized older adults and examine if comorbidities, frailty and acuity of clinical presentation exert an age-independent effect on COVID-19 severity. METHODS: We studied 275 patients admitted to the National Centre of Infectious Disease, Singapore. We measured: 1)Charlson Comorbidity Index(CCI) as burden of comorbidities; 2)Clinical Frailty Scale(CFS) and Frailty Index(FI); and 3)initial acuity. We studied characteristics and outcomes of critical illness, stratified by age groups (50-59,60-69 and &#8805;70). We conducted hierarchical logistic regression in primary model(N = 262, excluding direct admissions to intensive care unit) and sensitivity analysis(N = 275): age and gender in base model, entering CCI, frailty (CFS or FI) and initial acuity sequentially. RESULTS: The &#8805;70 age group had highest CCI(p<.001), FI(p<.001) and CFS(p<.001), and prevalence of geriatric syndromes (polypharmacy,53.5%; urinary symptoms,37.5%; chronic pain,23.3% and malnutrition,23.3%). Thirty-two (11.6%) developed critical illness. In the primary regression model, age was not predictive for critical illness when a frailty predictor was added. Significant predictors in the final model (AUC 0.809) included male gender (p=.012), CFS (p=.038), and high initial acuity (p=.021) but not CCI or FI. In sensitivity analysis, FI (p=.028) but not CFS was significant. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized older adults with COVID-19, geriatric syndromes are not uncommon. Acuity of clinical presentation and frailty are important age-independent predictors of disease severity. CFS and FI provide complimentary information in predicting interval disease progression and rapid disease progression respectively.","Lim, Jun Pei; Low, Kristabella Yu Han; Lin, Nicole Jia Jing; Lim, Celestine Zi Qian; Ong, Sean Wei Xiang; Tan, Wilnard Y T; Tay, Woo Chiao; Tan, Huei Nuo; Young, Barnaby Edward; Lye, David Chien Boon; Lim, Wee Shiong",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,281,30

In this study, we aimed to determine the clinical manifestations and outcomes of the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection (n=127). Materials and Methods: This prospective study was conducted on all COVID-19-suspected cases, admitted to Masih Daneshvari Hospital (a designated hospital for COVID-19), Tehran, Iran, since February 19, 2020. All patients were tested for COVID-19, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Data of confirmed cases, including demographic characteristics, clinical features, and outcomes, were collected and compared between three groups of patients, requiring different types of admission (requiring ICU admission, admission to the general ward, and transfer to ICU). Results: Of 412 suspected cases, with the mean age of 54.1 years (SD=13.4), 127 (31%) were positive for COVID-19. Following the patients' first visit to the clinic, 115 cases were admitted to the general ward, while ten patients required ICU admission. Due to clinical deterioration in the condition of 25 patients (out of 115 patients), ICU admission was essential. Based on the results, the baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. Patients requiring ICU admission were more likely to have multiorgan involvement (liver involvement, P<0.001; renal involvement, P<0.001; and cardiac involvement, P=0.02), low O2 saturation (P<0.001), and lymphopenia (P=0.05). During hospital admission, 21 (16.5%) patients died, while the rest (83.5%) were discharged and followed-up until March 26, 2020. Also, the survival rate of patients, who received immunoglobulin, was higher than other patients (60.87% vs. 39.13%). Conclusion: The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients was considerable in our study. Based on the present results, this infection can cause multiorgan damage. Therefore, intensive monitoring of these patients needs to be considered.","Baghaei, Parvaneh; Nadji, Seyed Alireza; Marjani, Majid; Moniri, Afshin; Hashemian, Seyed Mohammadreza; Sheikhzade, Hakimeh; Abtahian, Zahra; Heshmatnia, Jalal; Abedini, Atefeh; Jamaati, Hamidreza; Mansourafshar, Babak; Ahmadi, Zargham Hossein; Mokhber Dezfuli, Mojtaba; Seifi, Sharareh; Sadeghi, Mohsen; Mirenayat, Maryam Sadat; Yassari, Fatemeh; Lookzadeh, Somayeh; Farzanegan, Behrooz; Kiani, Arda; Vasheghani, Maryam; Dastan, Farzaneh; Eslaminejad, Alireza; Malekmohammad, Majid; Varahram, Mohammad; Zali, Alireza; Tabarsi, Payam; Velayati, Ali Akbar",Tanaffos,281,16

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the short-term effects of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis, staging, and treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data in the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) of Sweden on newly diagnosed PCa cases and on the number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed between 18 March 2020 and 2 June 2020 were compared with those in the corresponding time periods in 2017-2019, as reported until January 31 of the year after each study period. RESULTS: During the study period in 2020, 36% fewer PCa cases were registered in NPCR compared with the corresponding time period in previous years: 1458 cases in 2020 vs a mean of 2285 cases in 2017-2019. The decrease in new PCa registrations was more pronounced in men above age 75 years, down 51%, than in men aged 70-75, down 37%, and in men below age 70, down 28%. There was no decrease in the number of radical prostatectomies and number of radical radiotherapy courses increased by 32%. CONCLUSIONS: During the peak of the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of men diagnosed with PCa in Sweden decreased by one third compared with previous years, whereas there was no decrease in the number of curative treatments.","Fallara, Giuseppe; Sandin, Fredrik; Styrke, Johan; Carlsson, Stefan; Lissbrant, Ingela Franck; Ahlgren, Johan; Bratt, Ola; Lambe, Mats; Stattin, Pär",Scand J Urol,281,26

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was a head-to-head comparison of diagnostic accuracy of patient self-testing with professional testing using a SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a manufacturer-independent, prospective diagnostic accuracy study of nasal mid-turbinate self-sampling and self-testing with symptomatic adults using a WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT. Procedures were observed without intervention. For comparison, Ag-RDTs with nasopharyngeal sampling were professionally performed. Estimates of agreement, sensitivity, and specificity relative to RT-PCR on a combined oro-/nasopharyngeal sample were calculated. Feasibility was evaluated by observer and participant questionnaires. RESULTS: Among 146 symptomatic adults, 40 (27.4%) were RT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. Sensitivity with self-testing was 82.5% (33/40; 95% CI 68.1-91.3), and 85.0% (34/40; 95% CI 70.9-92.9) with professional testing. At high viral load (&#8805;7.0 log10 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/ml), sensitivity was 96.6% (28/29; 95% CI 82.8-99.8) for both self- and professional testing. Deviations in sampling and testing were observed in 25 out of the 40 PCR-positives. Most participants (80.9%) considered the Ag-RDT as easy to perform. CONCLUSION: Laypersons suspected for SARS-CoV-2 infection were able to reliably perform the Ag-RDT and test themselves. Procedural errors might be reduced by refinement of the instructions for use or the product design/procedures. Self-testing allows more wide-spread and frequent testing.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), similarly to other coronaviruses demonstrate neurotropism; the viral infection of the brain stem may complicate the course of the disease through damaging central cardio-respiratory control. The systemic inflammation as well as neuroinflammatory changes are associated with massive increase of the brain pro-inflammatory molecules, neuroglial reactivity, altered neurochemical landscape and pathological remodelling of neuronal networks. These organic changes, emerging in concert with environmental stress caused by experiences of intensive therapy wards, pandemic fears and social restrictions, promote neuropsychiatric pathologies including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder (BD), various psychoses, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Thus, this paper aims to investigate anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and burnout in a sample of MHPs. We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study on 167 participants: 56 MHPs, 57 physicians working closely with COVID-19 patients, and 54 physicians not working closely with such patients. MHPs reported good overall mental health. Most MHPs reported no post-traumatic stress, and their scores were significantly lower compared to HPs working closely with COVID-19 patients. MHPs' hyperarousal scores were also significantly lower compared to HPs working closely with COVID-19 patients, while their intrusion scores were statistically significantly lower than those of all other professionals. Multivariable logistic regressions showed that MHPs had lower odds of exhibiting state anxiety and low personal accomplishment compared to HPs not working closely with COVID-19 patients. In sum, MHPs seem to show almost preserved mental health. Thus, given the high mental healthcare demand during a pandemic, it would be useful to rely on these professionals, especially for structuring interventions to improve and support the mental health of the general population and other healthcare workers.","Franzoi, I.

It is a prominently respiratory infection, with potential cardiological, hematological, gastrointestinal and renal complications. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is found in 0.5-25% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and constitutes a negative prognostic factor. Renal damage mechanisms are not completely clear. We report the clinical evolution of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who presented with AKI requiring attention from the Nephrology team in a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain. METHODS: This is an observational prospective study including all COVID-19 cases that required hospitalization and Nephrology management from March 6th to May 12th 2020. We collected clinical and analytical data of baseline characteristics, COVID-19 and AKI evolutions. RESULTS: We analyzed 41 patients with a mean age of 66.8 years (SD 2.1), 90.2% males, and with a history of chronic kidney disease in 36.6%. A percentage of 56.1 presented with severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 31.7% required intensive care. AKI etiology was prerenal in 61%, acute tubular necrosis in the context of sepsis in 24.4%, glomerular in 7.3% and tubular toxicity in 7.3% of the cases. We reported proteinuria in 88.9% and hematuria in 79.4% of patients. A percentage of 48.8 required renal replacement therapy. Median length of stay was 12 days (IQR 9-23) and 22% of the population died. Patients who developed AKI during hospital stay presented with higher C-reactive protein, LDH and D-dimer values, more severe pulmonary damage, more frequent ICU admission, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and biological drugs and renal replacement therapy requirement. CONCLUSIONS: Hypovolemia and dehydration are a frequent cause of AKI among COVID-19 patients. Those who develop AKI during hospitalization display worse prognostic factors in terms of pulmonary damage, renal damage, and analytical findings. We believe that monitorization of renal markers, as well as individualized fluid management, can play a key role in AKI prevention.","Tarragón, Blanca; Valdenebro, María; Serrano, Maria Luisa; Maroto, Alba; Llópez-Carratalá, M Rosario; Ramos, Antonio; Rubio, Esther; Huerta, Ana; Marques, María; Portolés, Jose",Nefrologia (Madrid),281,21

We aimed to analyse characteristics of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in Brazil, and to examine the impact of COVID-19 on health-care resources and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We did a retrospective analysis of all patients aged 20 years or older with quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital and registered in SIVEP-Gripe, a nationwide surveillance database in Brazil, between Feb 16 and Aug 15, 2020 (epidemiological weeks 8-33). We also examined the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic across three 4-week periods within this timeframe (epidemiological weeks 8-12, 19-22, and 27-30). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. We compared the regional burden of hospital admissions stratified by age, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and respiratory support. We analysed data from the whole country and its five regions: North, Northeast, Central-West, Southeast, and South. FINDINGS: Between Feb 16 and Aug 15, 2020, 254â288 patients with RT-qPCR-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to hospital and registered in SIVEP-Gripe. The mean age of patients was 60 (SD 17) years, 119â657 (47%) of 254â288 were aged younger than 60 years, 143â521 (56%) of 254â243 were male, and 14â979 (16%) of 90â829 had no comorbidities. Case numbers increased across the three 4-week periods studied: by epidemiological weeks 19-22, cases were concentrated in the North, Northeast, and Southeast; by weeks 27-30, cases had spread to the Central-West and South regions. 232â036 (91%) of 254â288 patients had a defined hospital outcome when the data were exported; in-hospital mortality was 38% (87â515 of 232â036 patients) overall, 59% (47â002 of 79â687) among patients admitted to the ICU, and 80% (36â046 of 45â205) among those who were mechanically ventilated. The overall burden of ICU admissions per ICU beds was more pronounced in the North, Southeast, and Northeast, than in the Central-West and South. In the Northeast, 1545 (16%) of 9960 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation outside the ICU compared with 431 (8%) of 5388 in the South. In-hospital mortality among patients younger than 60 years was 31% (4204 of 13â468) in the Northeast versus 15% (1694 of 11â196) in the South. INTERPRETATION: We observed a widespread distribution of COVID-19 across all regions in Brazil, resulting in a high overall disease burden. In-hospital mortality was high, even in patients younger than 60 years, and worsened by existing regional disparities within the health system. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need to improve access to high-quality care for critically ill patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, particularly in LMICs.

The Apple Watch can detect falls and alert caregivers and clinicians that help is needed; the device could also be used to objectively collect data on gait, fitness, and falls as part of clinical trials. However, little is known about the ease of use of this technology among older adult ED patients, a population at high risk of recurrent falls. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study-the Geriatric Acute and Post-Acute Fall Prevention Intervention (GAPcare) II-is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the Apple Watch Series 4 paired with the iPhone and our research app Rhode Island FitTest (RIFitTest) among older adult ED patients seeking care for falls. METHODS: We will conduct field-testing with older adult ED patients (n=25) who sustained a fall and their caregivers (n=5) to determine whether they can use the Apple Watch, iPhone, and app either (1) continuously or (2) periodically, with or without telephone assistance from the research staff, to assess gait, fitness, and/or falls over time. During the initial encounter, participants will receive training in the Apple Watch, iPhone, and our research app. They will receive an illustrated training manual and a number to call if they have questions about the research protocol or device usage. Participants will complete surveys and cognitive and motor assessments on the app during the study period. At the conclusion of the study, we will solicit participant feedback through semistructured interviews. Qualitative data will be summarized using framework matrix analyses. Sensor and survey response data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Recruitment began in December 2019 and was on pause from April 2020 until September 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Study recruitment will continue until 30 participants are enrolled. This study has been approved by the Rhode Island Hospital Institutional Review Board (approval 1400781-16). CONCLUSIONS: GAPcare II will provide insights into the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the Apple Watch, iPhone, and the RIFitTest app in the population most likely to benefit from the technology: older adults at high risk of recurrent falls. In the future, wearables could be used as part of fall prevention interventions to prevent injury before it occurs.

A community sample of 500 participants fulfilled a short Big Five Inventory (BFI), Questionnaire of Approach and Avoidance Motivation (QAAM), and two scales constructed according to the Covid-19 epidemiological guidelines in Croatia. The results of the hierarchical regression analysis indicate that agreeable and conscientious individuals are complying more with preventive measures. In addition, approach, not avoidance, motivation appears to be more important in following the guidelines. Results are discussed in terms of framing messages to explain goals that might be reached by compliant behaviour rather than emphasising the negative consequences of the pandemic.

METHODS: Monthly FDG PET-CT scanning activity was collected from 41/48 NHS England provider sites. Data from 31/41 sites were stratified by nononcology/oncology, cancer type, with lung cancer and lymphoma split into specific indications, turn-around times and delays due to radiotracer. RESULTS: In April and May 2020, a 32 and 31% decrease in activity was observed, a larger decrease for noncancer compared with cancer FDG PET-CT. In June 2020, activity started to recover with 6% fewer scans recorded compared with June 2019. Of the six most common indications, lung and oesophageal cancer had the largest decrease in activity and slowest recovery. Lymphoma and melanoma showed the smallest decrease and fastest recovery. Lung cancer scans for initial diagnosis/staging saw the largest fall and slowest recovery compared with scans for known lung cancer. There was no percentage increase in overall turn-around time compared with the same months in 2019, and no increase in turn-around time of more than 7 working days due to FDG supply during April and May 2020 compared with the 3 previous months. CONCLUSIONS: There is no correlation between FDG PET-CT activity (fall and recovery) in England and the ability to provide the service by NHS England. It most likely reflects a combination of changes in health-seeking behaviour, NHS health policy and a decrease in the use of investigations that carry a high risk of COVID-19 transmission.","Wong, Wai Lup; Ross, Peter; Peters, Kevin; Frenz, Marion; Hai, Tong; Ridgeon, Alex; Toop, Ralph; Strouhal, Peter; Bomanji, Jamshed",Nucl Med Commun,281,1

In humans, cadmium is poorly excreted, triggers pulmonary inflammation, reduces pulmonary function, and enhances lung injury by respiratory syncytial virus. OBJECTIVES: We examined the association of cadmium burden with mortality related to influenza or pneumonia. METHODS: This prospective analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) included 7,173 and 8,678 participants &#8805;45 years of age enrolled in NHANES-III and NHANES 1999-2006, respectively. Associations were evaluated between cadmium and mortality from influenza or pneumonia during a median follow-up of 17.3 y (NHANES-III, based on creatinine-corrected urine cadmium) and 11.4 y (NHANES 1999-2006, based on blood cadmium). Survey-weighted Cox proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) comparing the mortality of individuals at the 80th vs. the 20th percentile of cadmium concentrations. RESULTS: In NHANES-III, after adjustment for sex, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, serum cholesterol, hypertension, and NHANES phase (or cycle), the HR comparing influenza or pneumonia mortality among participants with creatinine-corrected urinary cadmium in the 80th vs. 20th percentile was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.26; p=0.002) in the population as a whole and 1.27 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.43; p=0.002) among never smokers. In NHANES 1999-2006, adjusted HRs for the 80th vs. 20th percentile of blood cadmium were 1.14 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.36; p=0.15) for the overall population and 1.71 (95% CI: 0.95, 3.09; p=0.07) in never smokers. DISCUSSION: Among middle-aged and older adults in the United States, higher cadmium burdens are associated with higher mortality from influenza or pneumonia.

It is a major concern for individuals living with chronic disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Increasing evidence suggests an involvement of oxidative stress and contribution of NF&#954;B in the development of both COVID-19 and PD. Although, it is early to identify if SARS-CoV-2 led infection enhances PD complications, it is likely that oxidative stress may exacerbate PD progression in COVID-19 affected individuals and/or vice versa. In the current study, we sought to investigate whether NF&#954;B-associated inflammatory pathways following oxidative stress in SARS-CoV-2 and PD patients are correlated. Toward this goal, we have integrated bioinformatics analysis obtained from Basic Local Alignment Search Tool of Protein Database (BLASTP) search for similarities of SARS-CoV-2 proteins against human proteome, literature review, and laboratory data obtained in a human cell model of PD. A Parkinson's like state was created in 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA)-induced differentiated dopamine-containing neurons (dDCNs) obtained from an immortalized human neural progenitor cell line derived from the ventral mesencephalon region of the brain (ReNVM). The results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 infection and 6OHDA-induced toxicity triggered stimulation of caspases-2, -3 and -8 via the NF&#954;B pathway resulting in the death of dDCNs. Furthermore, specific inhibitors for NF&#954;B and studied caspases reduced the death of stressed dDCNs. The findings suggest that knowledge of the selective inhibition of caspases and NF&#954;B activation may contribute to the development of potential therapeutic approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 and PD.","Chaudhry, Zahara L; Klenja, Donika; Janjua, Najma; Cami-Kobeci, Gerta; Ahmed, Bushra Y",,281,29

In this study we evaluated a SARS-CoV-2 LDT for the NeuMoDx 96 system, a fully automated device performing extraction and real-time PCR. METHODS: A publicly available SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay was adapted for the automated system. Analytical performance was evaluated using in-vitro transcribed RNA and clinical performance was compared to the cobas 6800-based reference assay within the lab. RESULTS: The Envelope (E) Gene-LDT displayed good analytical performance with an LoD of 95.55 cp/mL and no false positives during evaluation of cross-reactivity. A total of 176 patient samples were tested with both the E-Gene-LDT and the reference assay. Positive and negative agreement were 100 % and 99.2 % respectively. Invalid-rate was 6.3 %. CONCLUSION: The E-Gene-LDT showed analytical and clinical performance comparable to the cobas6800-based reference assay.

Therapeutic benefits of using RDS for both disease control and prevention, in the effort to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have been shown. However, the biochemically active constituents of RDS and their mechanisms of action are still unclear. The goal of the present study is to clarify the material foundation and action mechanism of RDS. METHODS: To conduct an analysis of RDS, an integrative analytical platform was constructed, including target prediction, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and cluster analysis; further, the hub genes involved in the disease-related pathways were identified, and the their corresponding compounds were used for in vitro validation of molecular docking predictions. The presence of these validated compounds was also measured in samples of the RDS formula to quantify the abundance of the biochemically active constituents. In our network pharmacological study, a total of 26 bioinformatic programs and databases were used, and six networks, covering the entire Zang-fu viscera, were constructed to comprehensively analyze the intricate connections among the compounds-targets-disease pathways-meridians of RDS. RESULTS: For all 1071 known chemical constituents of the nine ingredients in RDS, identified from established TCM databases, 157 passed drug-likeness screening and led to 339 predicted targets in the constituent-target network. Forty-two hub genes with core regulatory effects were extracted from the PPI network, and 134 compounds and 29 crucial disease pathways were implicated in the target-constituent-disease network. Twelve disease pathways attributed to the Lung-Large Intestine meridians, with six and five attributed to the Kidney-Urinary Bladder and Stomach-Spleen meridians, respectively. One-hundred and eighteen candidate constituents showed a high binding affinity with SARS-coronavirus-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), as indicated by molecular docking using computational pattern recognition. The in vitro activity of 22 chemical constituents of RDS was validated using the 3CLpro inhibition assay. Finally, using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry in data-independent analysis mode, the presence of seven out of these 22 constituents was confirmed and validated in an aqueous decoction of RDS, using reference standards in both non-targeted and targeted approaches. CONCLUSION: RDS acts primarily in the Lung-Large Intestine, Kidney-Urinary Bladder and Stomach-Spleen meridians, with other Zang-fu viscera strategically covered by all nine ingredients. In the context of TCM meridian theory, the multiple components and targets of RDS contribute to RDS's dual effects of health-strengthening and pathogen-eliminating.

Therefore, Taiwan must implement internal disease-containment measures in addition to stopping infectious disease at its borders. With increasing numbers of patients coming to Taiwan for medical examinations, medical aesthetic treatments, and medical treatments and care, the risk of acute, chronic, and contagious diseases originating from non-residents must be considered and addressed. This article was developed to discuss the role and importance of nurses in preventing transnational infectious diseases from the perspective of international medical care. In addition to showing rich nursing experience, sensitivity, and conducting the management and communication of international cases, it is also necessary to make good use of information tools for remote screening care.

First, online detailed history of infectious diseases and nursing evaluations are conducted before admission. Second, preparation and movement notifications are given before admission. Third, online health education and follow-up care as well as cross-unit communication and coordination are implemented. International medical nurses directly affect the quality and effectiveness of international medical treatment.

We recently showed that the aging process can result in loss of homeostatic controls on CD8 TRM cells in the respiratory tract. This may be germane to treatment modalities in both influenza and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, particularly, the portion that present with symptoms linked to long-lasting lung dysfunction.

The complex dynamics and high-dimensional configuration spaces of deformables, compared to rigid objects, make manipulation difficult not only for multi-step planning, but even for goal specification. Goals cannot be as easily specified as rigid object poses, and may involve complex relative spatial relations such as""place the item inside the bag"". In this work, we develop a suite of simulated benchmarks with 1D, 2D, and 3D deformable structures, including tasks that involve image-based goal-conditioning and multi-step deformable manipulation. We propose embedding goal-conditioning into Transporter Networks, a recently proposed model architecture for learning robotic manipulation that rearranges deep features to infer displacements that can represent pick and place actions. We demonstrate that goal-conditioned Transporter Networks enable agents to manipulate deformable structures into flexibly specified configurations without test-time visual anchors for target locations. We also significantly extend prior results using Transporter Networks for manipulating deformable objects by testing on tasks with 2D and 3D deformables.

However, the lowest cutoff diameter of commercially available liquid impingers was about 0.3 µm, and the physical collection efficiency for nano-bioaerosol is only about 10-20%. Here, we enhanced the impinger's collection efficiency and recovery of viable viral aerosols by using packed glass beads and selected sampling media (1% peptone and lysogeny broth, LB). Single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) MS2 bacteriophage with uranine (as a physical tracer) was used as model viral aerosols. The effects of different sampling flow rates (4, 6, and 12.5 L per minute) and different sampling time (10, 20, and 30 min) on the collection efficiency and recovery of MS2 aerosols were also tested. Collection efficiency and recovery of viable viral aerosols were analyzed as a function of sampling media, flow rate, and sampling time and packed glass beads by using a general linear model. Although the packed glass beads considerably enhanced the collection efficiency of the liquid impinger for MS2 aerosols, the recovery of viable MS2 becomes lower due to the higher pressure drop across the impinger. Using peptone or LB as sampling media, reducing sampling flow rate, and decreasing sampling time was proven to improve the recovery of viable MS2. Conclusively, this study provides some practical methods to improve the collection efficiency of liquid impinger for viral aerosols and preserve their viability.","Chen, Yen-Chi; Wang, I-Jen; Cheng, Chih-Ching; Wu, Yu-Chiao; Bai, Chun-Hsuan; Yu, Kuo-Pin",Aerobiologia (Bologna),281,16

METHODS: Data collection was carried out in two moments: at baseline and after six months. An online questionnaire was applied to nurses to assess the frequency of use of some mental health promotion strategies and their depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (through the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales - short version (DASS-21)). RESULTS: The anxiety and stress symptoms significantly decreased over time. The physical activity increased, and a decrease was observed in the remote social contacts after six months. The stress, anxiety and depression scores were significantly lower in nurses who frequently or always used all strategies compared to participants who never or rarely used them, except for one strategy (rejecting information about COVID-19 from unreliable sources). CONCLUSIONS: Mental health promotion strategies, such as physical activity, relaxation activity, recreational activity, healthy diet, adequate water intake, breaks between work shifts, maintenance of remote social contacts, and verbalization of feelings/emotions, are crucial to reduce nurses' stress, anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Pinho, Lara; Correia, Tânia; Sampaio, Francisco; Sequeira, Carlos; Teixeira, Laetitia; Lopes, Manuel; Fonseca, César",Environ Res,281,33

MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the two months period of March-April 2020 versus 2019 the authors analyzed the surgical procedures performed in elective and emergency surgery with hospitalization and Day or Outpatient surgery regime. Surgical treatments with no hospitalization were planned in the Day-Surgery Service. The financing system impacts were analyzed according to the Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG), the costs accounting method mostly used in European countries. RESULTS: An overall reduction of 68.5% was recorded in surgical procedures, with a more relevant reduction of 92.3% in elective surgery and a significantly less relevant reduction of 37.2% in urgent one. Replantation did not present a reduction in number of cases, while cutting lesions of tendons at the hand and fingers increased such as the bone and ligament injuries during domestic accidents. The negative impact in the financial system recorded a reduction of 32.5%. DISCUSSION: The epidemiology of hand trauma looks not only at the artisanal and industrial injuries, but also mostly at the accidents in daily life activities. The data of the study evidenced the significantly increase in the injuries occurring in the domestic environment. Elective surgery was canceled. The 86% of surgical procedures performed were urgent ones and the 72.8% of these were possible in Day and Outpatient surgery with significantly reduction in hospitalization. All procedures followed a rigid process for patient and healthcare workers with regard for personal protection and safety. Telemedicine was arranged in emergencies, and economic damage was analyzed also in the following rebound effect during summer period. CONCLUSIONS: The significantly less reduction recorded in urgent surgery vs the more relevant reduction in elective one showed how the hand injuries remained a major issue also during the lockdown. The data highlighted the relevant role of the organizational aspects of the surgical procedures and planning in hand trauma. Despite the financial impact of the elective surgery, the presence of a functional and skill Emergency Service and Day-Surgery Service resulted fundamental in the efficacy and efficiency of the patient management and in containment of economic damage. The telemedicine was significantly limited by liability and risk management issues.","Leti Acciaro, A; Montanari, S; Venturelli, M; Starnoni, M; Adani, R",Musculoskelet. surg. (Online),281,16

People with risk factors for or pre-existing cardiovascular disease may be at greater risk. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities associated with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a variety of settings, including the community, care homes and hospitals. We also assessed the nature and rate of subsequent cardiovascular complications and clinical events in people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS: We conducted an electronic search from December 2019 to 24 July 2020 in the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, covid-19.cochrane.org, ClinicalTrials.gov and EU Clinical Trial Register. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies, controlled before-and-after, case-control and cross-sectional studies, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We analysed controlled trials as cohorts, disregarding treatment allocation. We only included peer-reviewed studies with 100 or more participants, and excluded articles not written in English or only published in pre-print servers. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened the search results and extracted data. Given substantial variation in study designs, reported outcomes and outcome metrics, we undertook a narrative synthesis of data, without conducting a meta-analysis. We critically appraised all included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for prevalence studies and the JBI checklist for case series. MAIN RESULTS: We included 220 studies. Most of the studies originated from China (47.7%) or the USA (20.9%); 9.5% were from Italy. A large proportion of the studies were retrospective (89.5%), but three (1.4%) were RCTs and 20 (9.1%) were prospective. Using JBI's critical appraisal checklist tool for prevalence studies, 75 studies attained a full score of 9, 57 studies a score of 8, 31 studies a score of 7, 5 studies a score of 6, three studies a score of 5 and one a score of 3; using JBI's checklist tool for case series, 30 studies received a full score of 10, six studies a score of 9, 11 studies a score of 8, and one study a score of 5 We found that hypertension (189 studies, n = 174,414, weighted mean prevalence (WMP): 36.1%), diabetes (197 studies, n = 569,188, WMP: 22.1%) and ischaemic heart disease (94 studies, n = 100,765, WMP: 10.5%) are highly prevalent in people hospitalised with COVID-19, and are associated with an increased risk of death.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Outcomes from consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous tenotomy with the TX-1 device were compared with outcomes from consecutive patients who underwent surgical tenotomy. Patients were contacted to retrospectively assess their outcomes at 4 time points: before treatment, 2 weeks after treatment, 3 to 6 months after treatment, and 12 months after treatment. Outcomes were assessed using the quick disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand score (QuickDASH) and the Oxford elbow score (OES). Student's t tests were used to compare postprocedural versus preprocedural scores and percutaneous versus surgical tenotomy scores. RESULTS: Response rates were 23 of 43 and 10 of 47 for surveyed percutaneous and surgical tenotomy patients, respectively. There were significant improvements from preprocedural scores in all primary outcome measures at 3-to-6-month and 12-month time points for both procedures. No significant changes from preprocedural scores were seen for either procedure at 2 weeks after treatment or between percutaneous and surgical tenotomy in preprocedural or postprocedural scores for any outcome measure. At 2 weeks, improved percutaneous tenotomy scores approached significance compared with percutaneous preprocedural QuickDASH (p = 0.060) and surgical 2-week OES function domain (p = 0.074) scores.

We report a retrospective descriptive study of the clinical course and maternal-fetal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a single-centre, retrospective study performed in a tertiary care hospital for pregnant women with COVID-19 in India. The medical records of all women who delivered in the COVID facility from May 5, 2020, to June 5, 2020, were reviewed independently. Data extracted from the records included demographic characteristics, obstetric details, comorbidities, disease severity, investigations, management, and information on neonates (birthweight, Apgar score, and perinatal complications). RESULTS: Among 348 women tested for SARS-CoV-2, 57 women (16.3%) were confirmed as positive based on quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of the nasopharyngeal specimen. Most women (45; 78.9%) had a mild infection with favourable maternal-fetal outcomes. Three maternal deaths were associated with comorbidities. Five neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, remained hemodynamically stable, and were subsequently discharged. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of pregnant women with COVID-19 had mild disease and recovered with good perinatal outcomes. Women with comorbidities may have an increased risk of severe morbidity and mortality. The cycle threshold signifying the viral load and degree of infectivity can modify management during pregnancy. Long-term outcomes and the potential mother-to-child vertical/horizontal transmission need further study.","Bachani, Sumitra; Arora, Renu; Dabral, Anjali; Marwah, Sheeba; Anand, Pratima; Reddy, K Sravani; Gupta, Nitesh; Singh, Balwinder",J. obstet. gynaecol.

This study looks upon the geographic distribution of the virus clades and variants circulating in different parts of India between January and August 2020. The NPS/OPS from representative positive cases from different states and union territories in India were collected every month through the VRDLs in the country and analyzed using next-generation sequencing. Epidemiological analysis of the 689 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples revealed GH and GR to be the predominant clades circulating in different states in India. The northern part of India largely reported the 'GH' clade, whereas the southern part reported the 'GR', with a few exceptions. These sequences also revealed the presence of single independent mutations-E484Q and N440K-from Maharashtra (first observed in March 2020) and Southern Indian States (first observed in May 2020), respectively. Furthermore, this study indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 variant (VOC, VUI, variant of high consequence and double mutant) was not observed during the early phase of virus transmission (January-August). This increased number of variations observed within a short timeframe across the globe suggests virus evolution, which can be a step towards enhanced host adaptation.","Yadav, Pragya D; Nyayanit, Dimpal A; Majumdar, Triparna; Patil, Savita; Kaur, Harmanmeet; Gupta, Nivedita; Shete, Anita M; Pandit, Priyanka; Kumar, Abhinendra; Aggarwal, Neeraj; Narayan, Jitendra; Vijay, Neetu; Kalawat, Usha; Sugunan, Attayur P; Munivenkatappa, Ashok; Sharma, Tara; Devi, Sulochna; Majumdar, Tapan; Jaryal, Subhash; Bakshi, Rupinder; Joshi, Yash; Sahay, Rima; Shastri, Jayanti; Singh, Mini; Kumar, Manoj; Rawat, Vinita; Dutta, Shanta; Yadav, Sarita; Krishnasamy, Kaveri; Raut, Sharmila; Biswas, Debasis; Borkakoty, Biswajyoti; Verma, Santwana; Rani, Sudha; Deval, Hirawati; Patel, Disha; Turuk, Jyotirmayee; Malhotra, Bharti; Fomda, Bashir; Nag, Vijaylakshmi; Jain, Amita; Bhargava, Anudita; Potdar, Varsha; Cherian, Sarah; Abraham, Priya; Gopal, Anjani; Panda, Samiran; Bhargava, Balram",Viruses,281,15

A great uncertainty is associated with the disease progression, as the risk of severe COVID-19 is not uniform among all the patients. Systemic inflammation has been reported as a predictor for COVID-19 outcomes. Elevated levels of inflammatory markers are shown to be associated with endothelial dysfunction, cytokine storm and coagulopathy in COVID-19. There is a growing body of evidence, that these findings exert influence in the causation of mortality in patients with severe Covid-19. The present study is carried out with an aim to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients by interrelating their clinical severity with inflammatory markers and CT (Computed tomography) severity score (CTSS). Objectives: The aim of the study is to correlate COVID-19 severity with inflammatory markers and CT severity score. We also aim to determine the optimal cut-off values for inflammatory markers and CT severity scores in order to establish their interrelationship to the disease severity. Materials and Methods: It is a hospital-based retrospective observational study. The study was conducted over a period of four months (July 2020 to October 2020) based on data obtained from the records of patients, admitted with a laboratory confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection. The current study included a total of 84 patients, admitted to ICU with the severe COVID-19.Study tools included serum CRP, serum ferritin, D-dimer, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and 25-point CT severity score obtained from HRCT (high resolution computerized tomography) chest. Results: Out of 84 patients recruited, 54 patients were survivors and 30 patients were non-survivors (deceased). 78% of the study population was male and 22% was female. For survivors, average CTSS was 12.43 ± 5.7 and whereas average CTSS for non-survivors was 18.87 ± 4.68(p&lt;0001). Average D-dimer was 2.5 ± 1.43 in the survivor group and 3.39 ± 0.95 for non-survivors (p&lt;0.004). Correlation coefficient of CTSS with FiO2 is 0.685 (p&lt;0.0001). The optimal cut-off value for predicting mortality for D-dimer is &gt;2.4 (p&lt;0.0012) and for CTSS is &gt;15 (p&lt;0.0001). Conclusion: The disease severity was significantly correlated with CTSS and D- dimer. Severe COVID-19 was also associated with a high NLR (neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio) and moderately elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, Ferritin, IL-6). CTSS &gt;15 and D-dimer &gt;2.4 correlate strongly with mortality.

A multitude of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection assays with disparate gene targets, including automated high-throughput platforms, are available. Varying concordance and interpretation of diagnostic results in this setting can result in significant reporting delays, leading to suboptimal disease management. This article reports the development of a novel ORF1a-based SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay - Viroselect - that shows high concordance with conventional assays and the ability to resolve inconclusive results generated during the peak of the epidemic in Mumbai, India. METHODS: A unique target region within SARS-CoV-2 ORF1a - the non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) region - was used to design and develop the assay. This hypervariable region (1923-3956) between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was utilized to design the primers and probes for the RT-PCR assay. The concordance of this assay with commonly used emergency use authorization (US Food and Drug Administration) manual kits and an automated high-throughput testing platform was evaluated. Further, a retrospective analysis was carried out using Viroselect on samples reported as 'inconclusive' between April and October 2020. RESULTS: In total, 701 samples were tested. Concordance analysis of 477 samples demonstrated high overall agreement of Viroselect with both manual (87.6%) and automated (84.7%) assays. Also, in the retrospective analysis of 224 additional samples reported as 'inconclusive', Viroselect was able to resolve 100% (19/19) and 93.7% (192/205) of samples which had inconclusive results on manual and automated high-throughput platforms, respectively. CONCLUSION: Viroselect had high concordance with conventional assays, both manual and automated, and has potential to resolve inconclusive samples.","Jawade, Ketki; Sinha, Akhauri Yash; Bhagat, Sharad; Bhowmick, Shilpa; Chauhan, Bhagyashree; Kaginkar, Snehal; Palav, Harsha; Kasarpalkar, Nandini; Devadiga, Pratik; Karandikar, Kalyani; Agrawal, Sachee; Shastri, Jayanthi; Munne, Kiran; Bhor, Vikrant M; Mahale, Smita D; Bhowmik, Subhanjan; Jagtap, Dhanashree; Patel, Vainav",Int J Infect Dis,281,1

Limited data are available comparing the test performance characteristics of these assays. METHODS: A diagnostic comparison study was performed to evaluate the performance of the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay compared to the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay using clinical nasopharyngeal specimens. Agreement between the two assays was assessed by overall, positive, and negative percent agreement and Cohen's kappa coefficient. RESULTS: A total of 104 (54 positive and 50 negative) clinical nasopharyngeal samples were tested by both assays. Using the Panther Fusion as a reference standard, the Xpert demonstrated an overall agreement of 99.0% [95% confidence interval (CI): 94.8-100], positive percent agreement of 98.1% (95% CI: 90.1-100), and a negative percent agreement of 100% (95% CI: 94.2-100).

METHODS: Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google scholar were systematically searched to identify studies related to COVID-19 and the 2009 influenza pandemic. The pooled incidence rates of clinical features were estimated using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model with the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation method. RESULTS: The incidence rates of fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, rhinorrhea, myalgia/muscle pain, or vomiting were found to be significantly higher in influenza patients when compared with COVID-19 patients. The incidence rates of comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease/hypertension and diabetes, were significantly higher in COVID-19 compared with influenza patients. In contrast, comorbidities such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and immunocompromised conditions were significantly more common in influenza compared with COVID-19 patients. Unexpectedly, the estimated rates of intensive care unit admission, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, treatment with antibiotics, and fatality were comparable between hospitalized COVID-19 and 2009 influenza pandemic patients.

As this method of education continues to be widely used, understanding the current trend of its usage is critical. In this study, we performed a survey study of virtual lecture attendees and presenters to determine current usage and general consensus on virtual lectures in plastic surgery education. METHODS: An electronic survey was sent to attendees and presenters of virtual lectures using Google Forms. Demographic data, webinar usage patterns, and views on virtual lectures were collected. RESULTS: A total of 417 surveys were received. Prior to the COVID-19 era, 39.1percent of attendees did not use virtual lectures and 45.6percent of presenters did not give webinars at all. Both groups reported that the lack of opportunities and need were the most common cause of no use of lectures or webinars. After the outbreak, 35.4percent of attendees now use virtual lectures daily and 51.4percent of presenters give lectures weekly. Over 90percent of the study population reported a positive experience with the virtual lectures due to increased interaction, convenience, outreach, and usability. Finally, over 75percent stated that virtual lectures might replace classroom lectures in the future. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that a majority of plastic surgeons have begun to use and give virtual lectures daily after the COVID-19 outbreak. Virtual education is a powerful and versatile tool that has great potentials, and it may continue to serve as a part of surgical training in the future.","Cho, Min-Jeong; Hong, Joon Pio",J. plast. reconstr. aesthet. surg,281,15

Neurologic complications have not been widely reported without associated respiratory symptoms. These neurologic manifestations have been found mostly in the elderly. There has been no report of ataxia or COVID-19 cerebellitis in the young adult population without associated respiratory symptoms. CASE REPORT: Here we report the case of a 30-year-old patient who presented with isolated cerebellar symptoms and was diagnosed with COVID-19 cerebellitis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: It is important for emergency physicians to know that COVID-19 can have many clinical manifestations and to have a high level of suspicion with acute neurologic symptoms.","Povlow, Adriana; Auerbach, Andrew J",J. emerg. med,281,9

Researchers are now forced to look for resources to cope with negative experiences linked to this health emergency. According to the salutogenic approach proposed by Antonovsky, the sense of coherence (SOC) is a major source of resilience. Thus, this study aimed at assessing the role of SOC in moderating the link between illness experiences (in terms of knowing persons diagnosed with COVID-19 and fear of contracting COVID-19) and psychological well-being. 2,784 participants, taken from a large sample of the Italian population (65.4% females) and aged between 18 and 85 years, filled in an anonymous online survey during the 3rd week of the lockdown. Findings supported the moderating role of SOC in shaping the link between illness experiences and psychological well-being. Specifically, participants who knew at least one person diagnosed with COVID-19 showed lower levels of psychological well-being at low levels of SOC. The negative relation between participants' fear of contracting COVID-19 and psychological well-being was stronger for those who showed higher levels of SOC. This study discusses the implications of these results for interventions aimed at reducing the pandemic's detrimental effects and promoting resilience.","Barni, Daniela; Danioni, Francesca; Canzi, Elena; Ferrari, Laura; Ranieri, Sonia; Lanz, Margherita; Iafrate, Raffaella; Regalia, Camillo; Rosnati, Rosa",Front Psychol,281,33

Rates of mortality and hospitalization are highest among those of racial and ethnic minority persons, including Latinx persons. Further, Latinx persons have been experiencing elevated mental health problems in response to the pandemic compared to non-Latinx Whites. The current study examined whether individual differences in anxiety sensitivity (AS) related to more severe emotional distress associated with social distancing, financial strain, fear of COVID-19, and physical health symptoms stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic among Latinx adults. Methods: Participants included 188 Latinx persons (31.4% female, M age = 34.1 years, SD = 8.16) recruited via an online survey panel program. Results: Results indicated that AS significantly contributed to increased severity of the emotional stress response associated with social distancing (&#916;R 2 = 0.15, p < 0.001), financial strain (&#916;R 2 = 0.15, p < 0.001), physical health symptoms (&#916;R 2 = 0.03, p = 0.006), and fear of COVID-19 (&#916;R 2 = 0.15, p < 0.001). These effects were evident over and above the variance accounted for by gender, years living in the United States, education, and work and home life COVID-19-related stress. Conclusions: These cross-sectional findings suggest AS may be an important individual difference factor for better understanding mental health among Latinx persons in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mayorga, Nubia A; Garey, Lorra; Viana, Andres; Cardoso, Jodi Berger; Schmidt, Norman B; Zvolensky, Michael J",Cognit Ther Res,281,1

However, existing methods that cluster T-cell receptor sequences by similarity are computationally inefficient, making them impractical to use on the ever-expanding datasets of the immune repertoire. Here, we developed GIANA (Geometric Isometry-based TCR AligNment Algorithm) a computationally efficient tool for this task that provides the same level of clustering specificity as TCRdist at 600 times its speed, and without sacrificing accuracy. GIANA also allows the rapid query of large reference cohorts within minutes. Using GIANA to cluster large-scale TCR datasets provides candidate disease-specific receptors, and provides a new solution to repertoire classification. Querying unseen TCR-seq samples against an existing reference differentiates samples from patients across various cohorts associated with cancer, infectious and autoimmune disease. Our results demonstrate how GIANA could be used as the basis for a TCR-based non-invasive multi-disease diagnostic platform.","Zhang, Hongyi; Zhan, Xiaowei; Li, Bo",Nat Commun,281,22

We begin by describing the function and practicality of the most common mask types used in dentistry: procedural masks, surgical masks, and filtering respirator facemasks (also called N95s). This is followed by a critical assessment of mask use based on a review of published evidence in three key domains: the degree to which each mask type is shown to protect against airborne and aerosolized disease, the reported likelihood for non-compliance among mask users, and risk factors associated with both proper and improper mask use. We use this information to conclude our review with several practical, evidence-based recommendations for mask use in dental and dental educational clinics.","Bradford Smith, P.; Agostini, Gina; Mitchell, John C.",Saf.

METHODS: An online survey was designed using Google Forms focusing on the local impact of the pandemic on pancreatic surgery. The survey was conducted at 2 different time points, during and after the lockdown. RESULTS: Twenty-five respondents (25/56) completed the survey. Many aspects of oncological care have been affected with restrictions and delays: staging, tumor board, treatment selection, postoperative course, adjuvant treatments, outpatient care, and follow-up. Overall, 60% of respondents have prioritized pancreatic cancer patients according to stage, age, and comorbidities, and 40% opted not to operate high-risk patients.

Various existing basic or advanced life support (BLS or ALS, respectively) rules for the termination of resuscitation (TOR) have been derived and validated in North America and Asian countries. This study aimed to evaluate the external validation of these rules in predicting the survival outcomes of OHCA patients in the COVID-19 era. METHODS: This was a multicenter observational study using the WinCOVID-19 Daegu registry data collected during February 18-March 31, 2020. The subjects were patients who showed cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac etiology. The outcomes of each rule were compared to the actual patient survival outcomes. The sensitivity, specificity, false positive value (FPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) of each TOR rule were evaluated. RESULTS: In total, 170 of the 184 OHCA patients were eligible and evaluated. TOR was recommended for 122 patients based on the international basic life support termination of resuscitation (BLS-TOR) rule, which showed 85% specificity, 74% sensitivity, 0.8% FPV, and 99% PPV for predicting unfavorable survival outcomes. When the traditional BLS-TOR rules and KoCARC TOR rule II were applied to our registry, one patient met the TOR criteria but survived at hospital discharge. With regard to the FPV (upper limit of 95% confidence interval < 5%), specificity (100%), and PPV (> 99%) criteria, only the KoCARC TOR rule I, which included a combination of three factors including not being witnessed by emergency medical technicians, presenting with an asystole at the scene, and not experiencing prehospital shock delivery or return of spontaneous circulation, was found to be superior to all other TOR rules. CONCLUSION: Among the previous nine BLS and ALS TOR rules, KoCARC TOR rule I was most suitable for predicting poor survival outcomes and showed improved diagnostic performance. Further research on variations in resources and treatment protocols among facilities, regions, and cultures will be useful in determining the feasibility of TOR rules for COVID-19 patients worldwide.","Jung, Haewon; Lee, Mi Jin; Cho, Jae Wan; Lee, Sang Hun; Lee, Suk Hee; Mun, You Ho; Chung, Han-Sol; Kim, Yang Hun; Kim, Gyun Moo; Park, Sin-Youl; Jeon, Jae Cheon; Kim, Changho",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,281,20

Telemedicine involves the electronic exchange of medical information between two remote sites for the optimization of patient care, whereas telehealth is the application of all electronic communication and delivery systems in the provision of healthcare. Telehealth gives patients an opportunity to communicate with their healthcare providers and, overall, access ambulatory care that otherwise is not available in their area of residence. Several telehealth delivery systems are available for electronic communication. Telehealth and other communications technologies used in the delivery of healthcare services are regulated at both the federal and state levels. Coverage and payment policies vary among the different insurers (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and private plans), and policies may further be defined by state telehealth parity laws. Telenutrition involves the use of digital technology to provide nutrition care to patients and caregivers and shows potential to optimize nutrition care and outcomes. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has contributed to sweeping legislative and regulatory changes that allowed the temporary expansion of telehealth delivery and reimbursement to maintain continuity of care for patients who were not able to come in for an in-person office visit with their healthcare provider. The purpose of this review is to introduce key concepts of telehealth delivery systems including policy, legal, and regulatory considerations for ambulatory care as well as the role of telenutrition in nutrition care, and highlight the evolving role of telehealth in optimizing patient and nutrition care during a pandemic and beyond.","Shah, Neha D; Krupinski, Elizabeth A; Bernard, Jordana; Moyer, Meagan F",,281,20

METHODS: According to the official data released by the National Health Commission, the epidemic data of infected people from 0:00 on January 24, 2020 to 24:00 on February 23, 2020 were quantitatively analyzed through statistical analysis. We used EXCEL software to draw the overall epidemic trend chart and Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) to carry out descriptive statistical analysis of mortality and cure rate. We made qualitative analysis on the emergency measures implemented by national administrative departments and provincial governments to work on controlling and monitoring COVID-19 nationwide spread. RESULTS: The number of patients diagnosed showed a linear increasing trend, with the slope increasing first and decreasing later. Suspected and new cases showed an inverted V pattern, with the peak occurring on February 8 and 12, respectively. There was a linear increase in the number of deaths and an exponential increase in the number of cures. Over the 31-day study period, the mortality rate fluctuated between 2.0% and 3.4%. The mean cure rate was 10.03%, the minimum value was 1.33%, and the maximum value was 32.05%. The quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that the public health emergency response system constructed in China plays a significant role in controlling the epidemic in a certain period of time. DISCUSSION: The four-tier emergency management system and the joint prevention mechanism established in China have provided various resources to control the epidemic, but there are still weakness in dealing with the spread of COVID-19. It is suggested to improve and strengthen the emergency management system, public health service system, health legal system, citizen health education, and international exchange and cooperation.","Xu, Tingting; Yang, Ruoyu",J Epidemiol Glob Health,281,1

Many efforts have been made to create vaccines and develop new antiviral drugs to cope with the disease. Here, we propose the application of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to degrade the viral genome, thus reducing viral infection. By introducing the concept of the probability of binding efficiency (PBE) and combining the secondary structures of RNA molecules, we designed 11 siRNAs that target the consensus regions of three key viral genes: the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) genes of SARS-CoV-2. The silencing efficiencies of the siRNAs were determined in human lung and endothelial cells overexpressing these viral genes. The results suggested that most of the siRNAs could significantly reduce the expression of the viral genes with inhibition rates above 50% in 24 hours. This work not only provides a strategy for designing potentially effective siRNAs against target genes but also validates several potent siRNAs that can be used in the clinical development of preventative medication for COVID-19 in the future.","Wu, Renfei; Luo, Kathy Qian",Int J Biol Sci,281,10

Telemedicine shows promise to address these challenges but lacks comprehensive evaluation in the inpatient environment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate an intrahospital telemedicine program (virtual care), along with its impact on exposure risk and communication. METHODS: We conducted a natural experiment of virtual care on patients admitted for COVID-19. The primary exposure variable was documented use of virtual care. Patient characteristics, PPE use rates, and their association with virtual care use were assessed. In parallel, we conducted surveys with patients and clinicians to capture satisfaction with virtual care along the domains of communication, medical treatment, and exposure risk. RESULTS: Of 137 total patients in our primary analysis, 43 patients used virtual care. In total, there were 82 inpatient days of use and 401 inpatient days without use. Hospital utilization and illness severity were similar in patients who opted in versus opted out. Virtual care was associated with a significant reduction in PPE use and physical exam rate. Surveys of 41 patients and clinicians showed high rates of recommendation for further use, and subjective improvements in communication. However, providers and patients expressed limitations in usability, medical assessment, and empathetic communication. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot natural experiment, only a subset of patients used inpatient virtual care. When used, virtual care was associated with reductions in PPE use, reductions in exposure risk, and patient and provider satisfaction.","Legler, Sean; Diehl, Matthew; Hilliard, Brian; Olson, Andrew; Markowitz, Rebecca; Tignanelli, Christopher; Melton, Genevieve B; Broccard, Alain; Kirsch, Jonathan; Usher, Michael",J Med Internet Res,281,1

Several studies have indicated that densely populated urban environments and the heavy dependence on traffic could increase the potential spread of COVID-19. This study investigated the association between changes in traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea. METHODS: This study analyzed the daily national traffic and traffic trend for 3 months from January 1, 2020. Traffic data were measured using 6307 vehicle detection system (VDS). This study analyzed the difference in traffic levels between 2019 and 2020. Non-linear regression was performed to analyze the change in traffic trend in 2020. The relationship between traffic and confirmed COVID-19 cases was analyzed using single linear regression. RESULTS: The mean daily nationwide level of traffic for the first 3 months of 2020 was 143 655 563 vehicles, which was 9.7% lower than the same period in 2019 (159 044 566 vehicles). All regions showed a decreasing trend in traffic in February, which shifted to an increasing trend from March. In Incheon there was a positive, but insignificant, linear relationship between increasing numbers of newly confirmed cases and increasing traffic (ß = 43 146; p = 0.056). CONCLUSIONS: Numbers of newly confirmed COVID-19 patients have been decreasing since March, while the traffic has been increasing. The fact that traffic is increasing indicates greater contact between people, which in turn increases the risk of further COVID-19 spread. Therefore, the government will need to devise suitable policies, such as total social distancing.","Lee, Hocheol; Park, Sung Jong; Lee, Ga Ram; Kim, Ji Eon; Lee, Ji Ho; Jung, Yeseul; Nam, Eun Woo",Int J Infect Dis,281,4

How long M-ECT should be continued, and what the outcome is after its discontinuation has not been adequately studied. In our tertiary psychiatric hospital, M-ECT treatments were suspended at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to determine the 6-month relapse rate and time to relapse after abrupt discontinuation of M-ECT and to assess the impact of patient and treatment characteristics on the risk of relapse. METHODS: Eighty-one patients whose M-ECT was discontinued abruptly were followed up prospectively for 6 months, or until relapse (i.e., hospital admission, restart of ECT, change of pharmacotherapy, or suicide (attempt)). We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to assess the impact of patient and treatment characteristics on the risk of relapse. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (44.44%) relapsed within 6 months following abrupt discontinuation of M-ECT. A greater number of previous acute ECT courses, a diagnosis of psychotic disorder (compared with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder), and a shorter interval between M-ECT treatments at the time of discontinuation were significantly associated with increased risk of relapse. CONCLUSION: Almost half of the patients relapsed, similar to the relapse rate after a successful acute course of ECT. Patients with a shorter interval between M-ECT treatments at the time of discontinuation seem to be at increased risk, as well as patients with a diagnosis of psychotic disorder, compared to patients with mood disorders.","Lambrichts, Simon; Vansteelandt, Kristof; Crauwels, Bo; Obbels, Jasmien; Pilato, Eva; Denduyver, Jonas; Ernes, Katrien; Maebe, Pieter-Paul; Migchels, Charlotte; Roosen, Lore; Buggenhout, Satya; Bouckaert, Filip; Schrijvers, Didier; Sienaert, Pascal",Acta psychiatr. scand,281,25

Recognizing how these diseases spread can therefore help identify specific disease control strategies. Classical mathematical models describing the evolution of infectious diseases underestimate the effect of the spatio-temporal spread of epidemics. Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic shows the importance of taking into account the spatial dynamics of epidemics and pandemics and the need for new control strategies including vaccinations, awareness and travel restrictions. Here, we consider a SIRS discrete-time multi-regional epidemic model that describes the spatial spread of an epidemic in different geographic areas believed to be related to movements of their populations. We propose a novel approach of optimal control by defining new functions of importance to identify affected areas based on infection thresholds that determine whether the need for a control intervention or not. Numerical results are provided to illustrate our results by applying this new approach in adjacent areas of Morocco, that is, the Casablanca-Settat regions.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: A large home-based primary care (HBPC) program in New York City (NYC) serving 873 homebound patients living in the community. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen primary care physicians. MEASUREMENTS: An 11-item assessment of provider perceptions of patients' experience with and barriers to telehealth. RESULTS: According to physicians in the HBPC program, more than one-third (35%) of homebound patients (mean age of 82.7; 46.6% with dementia; mean of 4 comorbidities/patient) engaged in first-time video-based telehealth encounters between April and June 2020 during the first COVID-19 surge in NYC. The majority (82%) required assistance from a family member and/or paid caregiver to complete the visit. Among patients who had not used telehealth, providers deemed 27% (n = 153) ""unable to interact over video"" for reasons including cognitive or sensory impairment and 14% lacked access to a caregiver to assist them with technology. Physicians were not knowledgeable of their patients' internet connectivity, ability to pay for cellular plans, or video-capable device access. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a large and dramatic shift to video-based telehealth use in home-based primary care. However, 4 months into the pandemic a majority of patients had not participated in a video-based telehealth encounter due to a number of barriers. Patients lacking caregiver support to assist with technology may benefit from novel approaches such as the deployment of community health workers to assist with device setup. Physicians may not be able to identify potentially modifiable barriers to telehealth use among their patients, highlighting the need for better systematic data collection before targeted interventions to increase video-based telehealth use.","Kalicki, Alexander V; Moody, Kate A; Franzosa, Emily; Gliatto, Peter M; Ornstein, Katherine A",J. am. geriatr. soc,281,32

Here we describe the psychological impact of a COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in patients with IBD. METHODS: This multicenter prospective cohort study included 145 patients recently diagnosed with IBD. Data on clinical and demographic characteristics, anxiety and depression scales, and IBD activity were collected in two telephone surveys, during and after the first COVID-19 lockdown in Spain. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: During lockdown, 33.1% and 24.1% scored high on the anxiety and depression scales, respectively. Independent factors related to anxiety (all values ORs; 95% CIs) during lockdown were female sex (2; 1.2-5.4) and IBD activity (4.3; 1.8-10.4). Factors related to depression were comorbidity (3.3; 1.1-9.8), IBD activity (6; 1.9-18.1), use of biologics (2.9; 1.1-7.6), and living alone or with one person (3.1; 1.2-8.2). After lockdown, anxiety and depression symptoms showed significant improvement, with 24.8% and 15.2% having high scores for anxiety and depression, respectively. Factors related to post-lockdown anxiety were female sex (2.5; 1.01-6.3), Crohn's disease (3.3; 1.3-8.5), and active IBD (4.1; 1.2-13.7). Factors associated with depression were previous history of mood and/or anxiety disorders (6.3; 1.6-24.9), active IBD (7.5; 2.1-26.8), and steroid use (6.4; 1.4-29). CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant psychological impact in patients with IBD. Disease activity was related to the presence of anxiety and depression symptoms during and after lockdown.","Sempere, Laura; Bernabeu, Purificación; Cameo, José; Gutierrez, Ana; Laveda, Raquel; García, Mariana Fe; Aguas, Mariam; Zapater, Pedro; Jover, Rodrigo; Ruiz-Cantero, María Teresa; Hofstadt, Carlos van-der",Gastroenterol. hepatol.

Methods: The data of epidemiology, clinical data and continuous dynamic chest high-resolution CT images of the patients with mild COVID-19 were analyzed retrospectively. Twenty-five patients (including 24 common type and 1 mild) were enrolled in the group, including 14 males and 11 females, with age of (42±12) years and hospital stay of (19±5) days. The basic images and dynamic images of HRCT were analyzed and compared by the radiologists. Results: The clinical manifestations were fever (22 cases), cough (18 cases), expectoration (8 cases), pharyngeal pain (6 cases). Most laboratory tests lacked specificity. There were no significant abnormalities on chest CT of one mild patient. HRCT findings of the common type were as follows: (1) the distribution of the lesions: most of the multiple lesions involved both lungs (19 cases), with average of 3 (3±1) lobes, located in the peripheral pulmonary zone near the pleura (22 cases); (2) the morphology and density of the lesions: most of the lesions were ground glass density foci (22 cases), which were patchy and massive (18 cases), nodular (10 cases) and arc broadband (7 cases); with the development of the disease, the density of some lesions increased with localized pulmonary consolidation (10 cases), accompanied by air bronchus sign (5 cases) and halo sign (5 cases). Dynamic changes of HRCT images in the chest: the positive manifestations were found on the 5th (5, 6) day after the onset of the disease, the progressive time of CT lesions was 5 (5, 7) days, the peak time of CT lesions was 11 (10, 13) days, and the turning time of CT lesions was 9 (8, 11) days. Conclusions: Dynamic chest HRCT can monitor the basic evolution process of the disease in patients with mild COVID-19, and provide a more intuitive basis for clinical early diagnosis and treatment.","Cheng, Zhaoping; Li, Yan; Duan, Yanhua; Gu, Hui; Liang, Changhu; Yan, Yumao; Gao, Baojuan; Li, Shaoxian; Sun, Linlin; Wang, Ximing",Chin.

Studies of adaptive divergence in urban areas often examine one or a few traits at a time from populations residing only at the most extreme urban and nonurban habitats. Thus, whether urbanization drives divergence in many traits simultaneously in a manner that varies with the degree of urbanization remains unclear. To address this gap, we generated seed families of white clover (Trifolium repens) collected from 27 populations along an urbanization gradient in Toronto, Canada, grew them in a common garden, and measured 14 phenotypic traits. Families from urban sites had evolved later phenology and germination, larger flowers, thinner stolons, reduced cyanogenesis, greater biomass and greater seed set. Pollinator observations revealed near-complete turnover of pollinator morphological groups along the urbanization gradient, which may explain some of the observed divergences in floral traits and phenology. Our results suggest that adaptation to urban environments involves multiple traits.","Santangelo, James S; Rivkin, L Ruth; Advenard, Carole; Thompson, Ken A",Biol Lett,281,27

The analysis of intracellular hydrogen peroxides and malondialdehyde suggested that the growth of C. utilis was inhibited under different concentrations of U(VI) due to the abundant production of reactive oxide species. The activity of intracellular antioxidants (e.g., super oxide dismutase and glutathione) was significantly enhanced under U(VI) stress, indicating the anti-toxic effect of C. utilis cells under low U(VI) stress.

Although various molecular diagnostic methods based on nucleic acid amplification have been suggested as gold standards for identifying different species, these methods are not suitable for the rapid diagnosis of pathogens owing to their long result acquisition times and complexity. In this study, we developed a rapid bio-optical sensor that uses a ball-lensed optical fiber (BLOF) probe and an automatic analysis platform to precisely diagnose infectious pathogens. The BLOF probe is easy to align and has a high optical sensing sensitivity (1.5-fold) and a large detection range (1.2-fold) for an automatic optical sensing system. Automatic signal processing of up to 250 copies/reaction of DNA of Q-fever-causing Coxiella burnetii was achieved within 8 min. The clinical utility of this system was demonstrated with 18 clinical specimens (9 Q-fever and 9 other febrile disease samples) by measuring the resonant wavelength shift of positive or negative samples for Coxiella burnetii DNA. The results from the system revealed the stable and automatic optical signal measurement of DNA with 100% accuracy.

An element-specific corrective term is derived as the difference between the 1s eigenvalues obtained from the self-consistent solutions to the non- or scalar-relativistic Kohn-Sham equations and the four-component Dirac-Kohn-Sham equations for a free neutral atom. We examine the dependence of this corrective term on the molecular environment and the amount of exact exchange in hybrid exchange-correlation functionals. This corrective term is then added as a perturbation to the quasiparticle energies from partially self-consistent and single-shot GW calculations. We show that this element-specific relativistic correction, when applied to a previously reported benchmark set of 65 core-state excitations [D. Golze et al., J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11, 1840-1847 (2020)], reduces the mean absolute error (MAE) with respect to the experiment from 0.55 eV to 0.30 eV and eliminates the species dependence of the MAE, which otherwise increases with the atomic number.

But current investigations mainly focus on UV light, which is not environment-friendly enough. On the other hand, the halogen bond is a novel tool for constructing supramolecular gels because of its good hydrophobicity, high directionality, tunable strength, as well as large size of halogen atoms. Herein, to construct a LC physical gel with both the advantages of halogen bond and visible light response, azopyridine-containing Azopy-C10 is chosen as a halogen bond acceptor, while 1,2-bis(2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-iodophenyl)diazene (BTFIPD) is selected both as the halogen bond donor and for the intrinsically visible light response. Such a binary gelator can self-assemble in the anisotropic solvent of nematic LC 5CB to form a LC physical gel. It experiences the gel-to-sol transition by green light irradiation. As the gelator concentration increases, the saturation voltage increases, but the switch-off time decreases. The combination of halogen bond and controllable visible light responsive LC physical gel provides the feasibilities of manipulating these smart soft materials.","Tong, Xun; Zhao, Xiaoyu; Qiu, Yuan; Wang, Hong; Liao, Yonggui; Xie, Xiaolin",Langmuir,281,24

African-Americans and older patients have less frequently used electronic messaging with their physicians. This study compares the utilization of virtual health care before and during the COVID pandemic for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. METHODS: A chart review of all IBD patients seen at an academic medical center from 2014-2020 was conducted to evaluate the use of telehealth options (e-messaging, e-visits) during a pre-COVID and COVID timeframe. Analysis of telehealth use from March - August 2018 and March - August 2020 was performed. Patient age, gender, race, IBD type, electronic messaging and telehealth visits were obtained. A confidential database was created. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher Exact test with significance set at p < 0.05. The study was IRB approved. RESULTS: 392 patients were in the pre-COVID cohort. There were 204 White, 99 African-American, 11 Asian, and 78 racially un-identified patients. 160 (40.8%) initiated E-communication with their physicians. There was a significant difference in the use of e-messaging based upon age (51.1% < 50 vs 39.7% &#8805; 50; pâ¯=â¯0.0396) and race (62.3% White vs 28.2% African-American; p < 0.00001).There were no significant differences in the use of e-messaging based upon patient gender (pâ¯=â¯0.6840) or IBD type (pâ¯=â¯0.6374). There were 295 patients in the COVID cohort. There were 155 White, 83 African American patients, 24 Hispanic patients, 10 Asian patients, and 22 racially un-identified patients. 109 (36.9%) utilized a telehealth option (53 via e-messaging; 56 via telemedicine visit). There was no significant difference in the use of a telehealth option based upon age (36.8% < 50 vs 37.25% &#8805; 50 years; pâ¯=â¯1.00), race (42.6% White vs 35.9% African-American; pâ¯=â¯0.2693) or IBD type (pâ¯=â¯0.331). Males used telehealth more than females (46.1% vs 29.7%, respectively; pâ¯=â¯0.0051). DISCUSSION: The COVID pandemic emergency increased e-visits and e-messaging for care delivery. Expanded telemedicine options for IBD patients eliminated previously identified racial and age disparities in virtual medical care. African Americans utilized electronic communication as frequently as Whites during the pandemic. Post-pandemic policy consideration for continued telemedicine options may expand patient-physician engagement and eliminate disparities in health care.","Hayrapetian, Laurie; Zepp, Molly; Rao, Sanjana; Hennessey, Megan; Houle, Matthew; Atienza, Matthew; Belfaqeeh, Omar Ali; Dharia, Ishaan; Khan, Ali; Borum, Marie L",J. natl. med. assoc,281,3

OBJECTIVES: In this observational multicenter study, based on children with AAE, we aimed to assess the proportion of household members possibly infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We collected data from all children observed with AAE, prospectively from April 7, 2020 to June 22, 2020, and retrospectively since February 28, 2020. The primary outcome was the household infection rate, defined as the proportion of family clusters having at least one member with COVID-19 infection other than the child with AAE (""index child""). The definition of a case was based on characteristic clinical signs and a positive PCR or serology. RESULTS: The study included 103 children in 10 French departments and in Quebec. The median age was 13 years and the interquartile range [8-15], with a female-to-male ratio of 1/1.15. In children with AAE, all PCR tests were negative (n=18), and serology was positive in 2/14 (14.3%) cases. We found no significant anomalies in the lab results.

METHODS: Based on the reference sequences of S protein, physical and chemical properties, hydrophobicity, signal peptide, transmembrane region, domain, secondary structure, tertiary structure analysis and antigenic epitopes prediction were carried out. Meanwhile, the tissue expression, related pathways and reactome pathways of angiotensis â converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and C-type lectin domain family 4 member M (CLEC4M) receptors were analyzed. RESULTS: The amino acid sequence of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV has a 75.80% consistency. The structural characteristics of the two coronaviruses are highly consistent, but the secondary structure and tertiary structure of SARS-CoV-2 is not as obvious as SARS-CoV. ACE2 and CLEC4M are expressed in alimentary system, heart, kidney, lung and placenta. The main related the pathways of renin-angiotensin system, protein digestion and absorption pathway, and the reactome pathways of metabolism of angiotensinogen to angiotensins, GPCR ligand binding, are related to typical symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 induced by SARS-CoV-2. Three pairs of highly or completely homologous epitopes of S protein were obtained. The 600-605, 695-703 and 888-896 amino acid residues in SARS-CoV-2 were highly homologous with 586-591, 677-685 and 870-878 amino acid residues in SARS-CoV, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The similarity of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV determines that they have similar infection patterns and clinical manifestations.

The COVID-NoLab risk score includes age, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation and identified risk groups with 0.8%, 11.4%, and 40.4% mortality in the validation group (AUROCC = 0.803). The COVID-SimpleLab score includes age, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, WBC, CRP, serum creatinine, and comorbid asthma and identified risk groups with 1.0%, 9.1%, and 29.3% mortality in the validation group (AUROCC = 0.833).

As a vaccine's efficacy relies on its ability to induce a protective immune response, these questions remain particularly pertinent. An improved understanding of the immunity offered by the antibodies developed against SARS-CoV-2 in recovered patients is critical for the development of diagnostic tests and vaccines. Methods: Our study aimed at the longitudinal analysis of antibody presence, persistence and its trend over eight months in a group of 30 COVID-19 recovered patients who tested positive by real-time quantitative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in the period 1-30 March 2020. The subjects were divided into two groups based on disease severity: mild (n=17 subjects) and moderately-severe (n=13 subjects). The MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV lgM/lgG chemiluminescent analytical system (CLIA) assay was used to analyze these antibody titres. Results: IgG antibody persistency was demonstrated in 76.7 % of the subjects (23 out of 30) at eight months post-infection. For the moderately-severe group, the titre trends for both IgM and IgG changed in a statistically significant way throughout the time period with IgM below and IgG above the set cut-off. Conclusions: The results of this study highlight an important point in terms of the association between humoral immune response and disease severity. Patients who have experienced a relatively severe infection might develop a stronger immune response that could persist for a longer period.","Dehgani-Mobaraki, P; Kamber Zaidi, A; Porreca, A; Floridi, A; Floridi, E; Monti, M; Dehgani-Mobaraki, M",Ann. ig,281,20

A variant emerging from the United Kingdom called SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01, or B.1.1.7, is thought to exhibit increased transmissibility that results from replication 4-10 times faster than the original Wuhan virus (Wuhan-Hu-1). Although this property is suspected to result from a specific mutation in the spike glycoprotein, D614G, there are 9 mutations that distinguish the UK variant B.1.1.7 from Wuhan-Hu-1 yet to be evaluated for functional effects. We asked if mutated positions fixed in UK variant B.1.1.7 may be involved in the virus life cycle, or evasion of the immune response, by modeling the UK variant spike protein and conducting structural analysis of mutations on the spike glycoprotein trimer (protomer) complexed to ACE2. Importantly, 4 out of 9 differences between the UK variant B.1.1.7 and Wuhan-Hu-1 spike protein alter direct intermolecular interactions. N501Y increased affinity between the spike protein and ACE2. The mutations at A570D, D614G and S982A reduced contact between individual chains of the trimeric spike protomer, potentially enhancing cleavage into S1 and S2 subunits, dynamic structural rearrangement and host cell fusion mechanisms. These data suggest that combined characteristics of mutations unique to UK variant B.1.1.7 enable high affinity binding to ACE2 and enhanced replication properties. The D614G mutation, associated with enhanced virus transmissibility, opens a potentially druggable structural pocket at the interface between spike glycoprotein subunits S1 and S2.","Ostrov, D.

We conducted an online survey across Brazil during the initial outbreak, in which 8,345 participants answered a questionnaire designed to identify the maximum tolerated risk (k') necessary for them to disregard social distancing recommendations and guarantee their salaries. Generalized linear mixed models, path analysis structural equation, and conditional interference classification tree were performed to further understand how sociodemographic factors impact k' and to establish a predictive model for the risk behavior of leaving home during the pandemic. We found that, on average, people tolerate 38% risk of infection to leave home and earn a full salary, but this number decreased to 13% when the individual risk perception of becoming ill from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is considered. Furthermore, participants who have a medium-to-high household income and who are older than 35 years are more likely to be part of the risk-taking group who leave home regardless of the potential COVID-19 infection level; while participants over 45 years old and with good financial health are more likely to be part of the risk-averse group, who stay home at the expense of any salary offered. Our findings add to the political and public debate concerning lockdown strategies by showing that, contrary to supposition, people with low socioeconomic status are not more likely to ignore social distancing recommendations due to personal economic matters.","Kluwe-Schiavon, Bruno; Viola, Thiago Wendt; Bandinelli, Lucas Poitevin; Castro, Sayra Catalina Coral; Kristensen, Christian Haag; Costa da Costa, Jaderson; Grassi-Oliveira, Rodrigo",PLoS One,281,33

Hence, in order to prevent ARDS, the pulmonary function maintenance has been the target of several pharmacological approaches. However, there is a lack of reports regarding the use of effective pharmaceutical active natural products (PANPs) for early treatment and prevention of COVID-19-related ARDS. Therefore, the aim of this work was to conduct a systematic review regarding the PANPs that could be further studied as alternatives to prevent ARDS. Consequently, this work can pave the way to spread the use of PANPs on the prevention of ARDS in COVID-19-confirmed or -suspected patients. METHODS: The search strategy included scientific studies published in English from 2015 to 2020 that promoted the elucidation of anti-inflammatory pathways targeting ARDS by in vitro and/or in vivo experiments using PANPs. Then, 74 studies regarding PANPs, able to maintain or improve the pulmonary function, were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The PANPs may present different pulmonary anti-inflammatory pathways, wherein (i) reduction/attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, (ii) increase of the anti-inflammatory mediators' levels, (iii) pulmonary edema inhibition and (iv) attenuation of lung injury were the most observed biological effects of such products in in vitro experiments or in clinical studies. Finally, this work highlighted the PANPs with promising potential to be used on respiratory syndromes, allowing their possible use as alternative treatment at the prevention of ARDS in COVID-19-infected or -suspected patients.","Amaral-Machado, Lucas; Oliveira, Wógenes N; Rodrigues, Victor M; Albuquerque, Nathan A; Alencar, Éverton N; Egito, Eryvaldo S T",Biomed Pharmacother,281,15

Unfortunately, there is still not a single proven effective drug available, and therefore, current therapeutic guidelines recommend supportive care including oxygen administration and treatment with antibiotics. Recently, patients have been also treated with off-label therapies which comprise antiretrovirals, anti-inflammatory compounds, antiparasitic agents and plasma from convalescent patients, all with controversial results. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is important for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and plays a pivotal role in viral replication processes. In this review, we discuss several aspects of the UPS and the effects of its inhibition with particular regard to the life cycle of the coronaviruses (CoVs). In fact, proteasome inhibition by various chemical compounds, such as MG132, epoxomycin and bortezomib, may reduce the virus entry into the eucariotic cell, the synthesis of RNA, and the subsequent protein expression necessary for CoVs. Importantly, since UPS inhibitors reduce the cytokine storm associated with various inflammatory conditions, it is reasonable to assume that they might be repurposed for SARS-CoV-2, thus providing an additional tool to counteract both virus replication as well as its most deleterious consequences triggered by abnormal immunological response.","Longhitano, Lucia; Tibullo, Daniele; Giallongo, Cesarina; Lazzarino, Giacomo; Tartaglia, Nicola; Galimberti, Sara; Li Volti, Giovanni; Palumbo, Giuseppe Alberto; Liso, Arcangelo",,281,24

Many clinics reopened but required universal SARS-CoV-2 screening. However, the rate of positive results and the necessity for such testing is unknown. We report here on early results from asingle-center academic NewYork fertility practice utilizing universal SARS-CoV-2 screening. This mixed prospective retrospective cohort included 164 patients who underwent at least one SARS-CoV-2 screening test for fertility treatment between May and July2020. Patients completed 1 to 3 nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 tests per cycle and remained symptom-free to continue fertility treatments. SARS-CoV-2 test results, past results, history of Covid-19 infection, and patient/cycle characteristics were recorded and tabulated through October2020. Outcomes included positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests, rate of prior Covid-19 infections, and clinical courses of patients testing positive. Patients underwent 263 cycles entailing 460 total SARS-CoV-2 screening tests. Fifteen patients reported astrong prior clinical history of Covid-19. Six patients experienced apositive SARS-CoV-2 test (2.3% of all cycles). Among 77 cycles (n = 58 patients) entailing one SARS-CoV-2 test, 2 cases (2.6%) were noted. Among 173 cycles (n = 121 patients) entailing two SARS-CoV-2 tests, 4 cycles (2.3%) were noted. Zero (0%) of 13 cycles (n = 13 patients) entailing 3 SARS-CoV-2 tests were positive. All patients were cleared to resume treatment within one month. Overall, anew asymptomatic infection was identified in 2 cycles (0.8%), while 4 of the 6 positive SARS-CoV-2 tests were among patients with aprior history of Covid-19. 3 of 4 also had adocumented prior positive RNA test. Our data suggest that universal SARS-CoV-2 screening among fertility patients is feasible, with an approximately 2% positive rate per cycle among the patients of this study.

Scientists have made strides in estimating key transmission and epidemiological parameters. In particular, accumulating evidence points to a substantial fraction of asymptomatic or subclinical infections, which influences our understanding of the transmission potential and severity of this emerging disease. In this study, we derive estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources. METHODS: We employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For this purpose, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wuhan City together with epidemiological data of Japanese repatriated from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were integrated into our analysis. RESULTS: Our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China, in 2019-2020 reached values at 3.49 (95% CrI 3.39-3.62) with a mean serial interval of 6.0 days, and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23 in 2020 was associated with a significantly reduced R at 0.84 (95% CrI 0.81-0.88), with the total number of infections (i.e., cumulative infections) estimated at 1,906,634 (95% CrI 1,373,500-2,651,124) in Wuhan City, elevating the overall proportion of infected individuals to 19.1% (95% CrI 13.5-26.6%). We also estimated the most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time-delay adjusted IFR at 0.04% (95% CrI 0.03-0.06%) and 0.12% (95% CrI 0.08-0.17%), respectively, estimates that are substantially smaller than the crude CFR estimated at 4.06%. CONCLUSIONS: We have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, during January-February 2020 using an ecological modeling approach that is suitable to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems. Our estimate of time-delay adjusted IFR falls in the range of the median IFR estimates based on multiple serological studies conducted in several areas of the world.","Mizumoto, Kenji; Kagaya, Katsushi; Chowell, Gerardo",BMC Med,281,24

Children (n=105) from two Argentinian cities (Salta in the northwest and 9 de Julio in the Pampean region), reported the fruits and vegetables they consumed, with the Free Listing and the new Free Drawing methods. Contingency tables were built and cognitive saliency indexes (CSI) were calculated. Children evoked 57 fruits and 54 vegetables by both methods, which were then grouped into 31 fruit and 27 vegetable categories. The advantages and limitations of the methods are discussed. Throughout Free Drawing, each food was defined by its name, shape and colour, which allowed better discrimination between varieties. Children from Salta reported consuming more fruits (63.7%) and vegetables (68.6%) than those from 9 de Julio (p<0.05). Differences between cultural groups were found in 10 fruits and 7 vegetables, mentioned more frequently in Salta, where regional crops arose principally by Free Listing. The CSI did not depend on the method used but, for vegetables, they were affected by the cultural group. The fruits with the greatest CSI were banana and apples followed by orange (CSI&#8805;0.19). Tomatoes, carrot and pumpkins showed the highest CSI in 9 de Julio; while carrot, tomatoes, varieties of lettuce and potatoes had the highest CSI in Salta (0.17&#8804;CSI&#8804;0.33).

In a cohort study, we tested the hypothesis that COVID-19 was associated with increased in-hospital mortality and decreased decisions to forgo LST in patients with cancer and acute respiratory failure. We employed two multivariate logistic regression models. Propensity score matching was employed as sensitivity analysis. We compared 382 patients without COVID-19 with 65 with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 had better performance status, less metastatic tumors, and progressive cancer. In-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 was lower compared with patients without COVID-19 (46.2 vs. 74.6%;p &lt; 0.01). However, the cause of acute respiratory failure (COVID-19 or other causes) was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.27 (0.55-2.93;95% confidence interval, CI)] in the adjusted model. The percentage of patients with a decision to forgo LST was lower in patients with COVID-19 (15.4 vs. 36.1%;p = 0.01).

METHODS: In this study, we used a mouse CLP model to simulate the clinical scenario of patients with sepsis, neutrophil infiltration, abnormal distribution and dysfunction was analyzed. LPS was used to stimulate neutrophils in vitro to simulate sepsis; single-cell gene sequencing technology was used to explore the immunological typing. To explore the immunological function of immunosuppressive neutrophils, PD-L1 knockout neutrophils were cocultured with lymphocytes from wild-type mice. RESULTS: We found that neutrophils presented variant dysfunction at the late stage of sepsis, including inhibition of apoptosis, seriously damaged chemotaxis and extensive infiltration into the tissues. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that multiple subclusters of neutrophils were differentiated after LPS stimulation. The two-dimensional spatial distribution analysis showed that Foxp3+ T cells were much closer to Ly-6G than the CD4+ and CD8+ cells, indicating that infiltrated neutrophils may play immunomodulatory effect on surrounding T-regs. Further observations showed that LPS mediates PD-L1 over expression through p38&#945;-MSK1/-MK2 pathway in neutrophils. The subsets of highly expressed PD-L1 exert immunosuppressive effect under direct contact mode, including inhibition of T cell activation and induction of T cell apoptosis and trans-differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data identify a previously unknown immunosuppressive subset of neutrophils as inhibitory neutrophil in order to more accurately describe the phenotype and characteristics of these cells in sepsis.","Qi, Xinxin; Yu, Yao; Sun, Ran; Huang, Jiamin; Liu, Lu; Yang, Yunxi; Rui, Tao; Sun, Bingwei",Crit Care,281,30

However, designing a QD-based optoelectronic device requires specialized approaches compared with designing conventional bulk-based solar cells. In this paper, design considerations for QD thin-film solar cells are introduced from two different viewpoints: optics and electrics. The confined energy level of QDs contributes to the adjustment of their band alignment, enabling their absorption characteristics to be adapted to a specific device purpose. However, the materials selected for this energy adjustment can increase the light loss induced by interface reflection. Thus, management of the light path is important for optical QD solar cell design, whereas surface modification is a crucial issue for the electrical design of QD solar cells. QD thin-film solar cell architectures are fabricated as a heterojunction today, and ligand exchange provides suitable doping states and enhanced carrier transfer for the junction. Lastly, the stability issues and methods on QD thin-film solar cells are surveyed.

Here, we investigated patterns of intraspecific variation in male reproductive investment in the terrestrial-breeding frog Pseudophryne guentheri. Like most anurans, breeding activity in P. guentheri is cued by precipitation, and therefore the timing and duration of breeding seasons differ among geographically separated populations, potentially leading to differences in the level of sperm competition. We, therefore, anticipated local adaptation in sperm traits that reflect these phenological differences among populations. Our analysis of six natural populations across a rainfall gradient revealed significant divergence in testes and ejaculate traits that correspond with annual rainfall and rainfall seasonality; males from the northern and drier edge of the species range had significantly smaller testes containing fewer, smaller and less motile sperm compared with those from mesic central populations. These findings may reflect spatial variation in the strength of postcopulatory sexual selection, likely driven by local patterns of precipitation.","Rudin-Bitterli, Tabitha S; Mitchell, Nicola J; Evans, Jonathan P",Biol Lett,281,20

METHOD: This study applied transfer learning method to develop deep learning models for detecting COVID-19 disease. Three existing state-of-the-art deep learning models namely, Inception ResNetV2, InceptionNetV3 and NASNetLarge, were selected and fine-tuned to automatically detect and diagnose COVID-19 disease using chest X-ray images. A dataset involving 850 images with the confirmed COVID-19 disease, 500 images of community-acquired (non-COVID-19) pneumonia cases and 915 normal chest X-ray images was used in this study. RESULTS: Among the three models, InceptionNetV3 yielded the best performance with accuracy levels of 98.63% and 99.02% with and without using data augmentation in model training, respectively. All the performed networks tend to overfitting (with high training accuracy) when data augmentation is not used, this is due to the limited amount of image data used for training and validation. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a deep transfer learning is feasible to detect COVID-19 disease automatically from chest X-ray by training the learning model with chest X-ray images mixed with COVID-19 patients, other pneumonia affected patients and people with healthy lungs, which may help doctors more effectively make their clinical decisions. The study also gives an insight to how transfer learning was used to automatically detect the COVID-19 disease. In future studies, as the amount of available dataset increases, different convolution neutral network models could be designed to achieve the goal more efficiently.","Albahli, Saleh; Albattah, Waleed",J Xray Sci Technol,281,20

Based on structural similarity with other Î³-secretase (Î³S) targets, we hypothesized that ACE2 may be affected by Î³S proteolytic activity. We found that after ectodomain shedding, ACE2 is targeted for intramembrane proteolysis by Î³S, releasing a soluble ACE2 C-terminal fragment. Consistently, chemical or genetic inhibition of Î³S results in the accumulation of a membrane-bound fragment of ectodomain-deficient ACE2. Although chemical inhibition of Î³S does not alter SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, these data point to a novel pathway for cellular ACE2 trafficking.","Bartolomé, Alberto; Liang, Jiani; Wang, Pengfei; Ho, David D; Pajvani, Utpal B",Sci Rep,281,22

METHODS: In the systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science for studies reporting allergic rhinitis, asthma prevalence in COVID-19 patients and compared clinical outcomes, and excluded duplicate publications, reviews, comments, single or few cases reports (< 100 cases). We determined the pooled effect estimates using random effect model. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies (345,091) were finally included for the meta-analysis. On the basis of 32 studies (337,821) involving with the severity of COVID-19, we did not find significant association between AAD and the severity of COVID-19 (p = 0.35, OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.90–1.35). Subgroup analysis indicated there was no the variability in the prevalence of AAD among COVID-19 patients in different study designs, disease categories, countries, the definition of severity, and population size of AAD. Based on 21 studies (306,331) involving with the mortality of COVID-19, AAD was significantly associated with the decreased mortality of COVID-19 (p < 0.05, OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70–0.99). The subgroup analysis showed AAD was not associated with the mortality of COVID-19 in different countries or regions. Based on the population size of AAD, we found AAD within 100 cases was not associated with the mortality of COVID-19 (p = 0.63, OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.65–2.03). Moreover, study design was possible heterogeneity source as the heterogeneity I(2) was reduced to 0 in prospective studies. CONCLUSION: The preexisting AAD was not inclined to deteriorate the course of COVID-19. The prevalence of AAD was not associated with the severity of COVD-19 patients and inclined to be significantly associated with the decreased mortality risk of COVID-19.

Fourteen family and carers of inpatients experiencing psychosis completed semi‐structured interviews examining their experiences of inpatient care during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Thematic analysis was used to analyse data. Four key themes were identified: ‘A turbulent journey to hospital admission’, ‘I need information and support’, ‘Maintaining my relationship with my loved one’ and ‘Inpatient care is a mixed bag’. Each theme comprised four or five subthemes. The findings demonstrated that family and carers feel excluded from inpatient care and struggled to maintain contact with their loved ones, which was exacerbated by COVID‐19 related restrictions. Communication and being regularly informed about their loved one’s care, as well as visiting loved ones, was particularly problematic. Inpatient care needs to be more inclusive of family and carers and ensure they are kept in mind at every stage of the admission.","Wood, Lisa; Constant, Callam; Byrne, Alison",Int J Ment Health Nurs,281,24

Physicians performing orbital procedures may be at increased risk of occupational exposure to the virus due to exposure to secretions. The goal of this study is to measure the droplet and aerosol production during repair of the inferior orbital rim and trial a smoke-evacuating electrocautery handpiece as a mitigation device. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The inferior rim of 6 cadaveric orbits was approached transconjunctivally using either standard or smoke-evacuator electrocautery and plated using a high-speed drill. Following fluorescein inoculation, droplet generation was measured by counting under ultraviolet-A (UV-A) light against a blue background. Aerosol generation from 0.300–10.000 μm was measured using an optical particle sizer. Droplet and aerosol generation was compared against retraction of the orbital soft tissue as a negative control. RESULTS: No droplets were observed following the orbital approach using electrocautery. Visible droplets were observed after plating with a high-speed drill for 3 of 6 orbits. Total aerosol generation was significantly higher than negative control following the use of standard electrocautery. Use of smoke-evacuator electrocautery was associated with significantly lower aerosol generation in 2 of 3 size groups and in total. There was no significant increase in total aerosols associated with high-speed drilling. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Droplet generation for orbital repair was present only following plating with high-speed drill. Aerosol generation during standard electrocautery was significantly reduced using a smoke-evacuating electrocautery handpiece. Aerosols were not significantly increased by high-speed drilling.","Ye, Michael J.; Vadhul, Raghav B.; Sharma, Dhruv; Campiti, Vincent J.; Burgin, Sarah J.; Illing, Elisa A.; Ting, Jonathan Y.; Park, Jae Hong; Koehler, Karl R.; Lee, Hui Bae; Vernon, Dominic J.; Johnson, Jeffrey D.; Nesemeier, B.

While providing 100% bioavailability, the intravenous route is often associated with pain and needle phobia from a patient perspective, which may translate as a reluctance to receive necessary treatment. Several non-invasive strategies have since emerged to overcome these limitations. One such strategy involves the use of microneedles (MNs), which are able to painlessly penetrate the stratum corneum barrier to dramatically increase transdermal drug delivery of numerous drugs. This review reports the wealth of studies that aim to enhance transdermal delivery of biopharmaceutics using MNs. The true potential of MNs as a drug delivery device for biopharmaceuticals will not only rely on acceptance from prescribers, patients and the regulatory authorities, but the ability to upscale MN manufacture in a cost-effective manner and the long term safety of MN application.

Most trials were registered from Central Government Institutions (48%), followed by State Government Medical Colleges (11%). Most number of trials was registered from GI surgery (32%). Most (90.5%) trials were single centre based. Common barriers to research are well known; if the State Government Medical Colleges can mentor a culture of research from an early stage of surgical training it can improve research productivity. Multicentre trials, involving smaller hospitals from tier 2 and tier 3 cities, are a potential solution to one of the major obstacles of surgical trials i.e. small number of patients; especially in this pandemic induced draught of elective surgical operations.

The aim was to create capacities for the in-hospital care of the patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to check whether a reduction in the number of trauma patients compared to the mean of the previous 3 years could be observed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all patients who presented in the emergency admission from 1 March to 15 April 2020 with the mean of the patients from the previous 3 years 2017–2019. The age of the patients, time of presentation, diagnoses, whereabouts of the patients, inpatient or outpatient, number and duration of the operative care and required capacity on the normal ward and intensive care units (ICU) were recorded. The injury mechanism was also examined. RESULTS: A total of 4967 patients between 1 March and 15 April were included. On average over the 3 previous years, a total of 1348 patients, i.e. 29.3 patients per day were counted in our emergency room. In 2020 a total of 923, i.e. 20 patients per day (p < 0.01) were counted. On average 227 (24.6%) were admitted to hospital compared to 311.5 (23.1%) in 2020.

However, none have studied a very large set of socio-economic indicators and analysed to what extent these factors could highlight populations at high risk for COVID-19. We propose here a new approach, a socio-economic wide study, to pinpoint subgroups with a high incidence of COVID-19, and illustrated this approach using hospitalized cases in Paris area. Methods We extracted 303 socio-economic indicators from French census data for the 855 residential units in Paris and assessed their association with COVID-19 hospitalization risk. We then fitted a predictive model using a penalized regression on these indicators to predict the incidence of patient hospitalization for COVID-19 in Paris. Findings The most associated indicator was income, corresponding to the 3rd decile of the population (OR= 0.11, CI95% [0.05; 0.20]). A model including only income achieves a high performance in both the training set (AUC=0.78, CI95%: 0.72-0.85) and the test set (AUC=0.79 (CI95%: 0.71-0.87). Overall, the 45% most deprived areas gathered 86% of the areas with a high incidence of COVID-19 hospitalized cases. Interpretation During the first wave of the epidemic, income predicted Paris areas at risk for a high incidence of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with a high performance. Socio-economic wide association studies, collecting passively data from hospitalized cases, therefore not necessitating any effort for health caregivers, is of particular interest in such a period of hospital overcrowding as it provides real-time indirect information on populations having high COVID-19 incidence.","Jannot, A.-S.; Countouris, H.; Burgun, A.; Katsahian, S.; Rance, B.",,281,26

However, the accumulation of dust and moisture within these systems increases the risk of transmission of microbes and have on occasion been associated with outbreaks of infection. Nevertheless, the impact of air-conditioning on the transmission of microorganisms leading to infection remains largely uncertain. We conducted a scoping review to screen systematically the evidence for such an association in the face of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases were explored for relevant studies addressing microbial contamination of the air, their transmission and association with infectious diseases. The review process yielded 21 publications, 17 of which were cross-sectional studies, three were cohort studies and one case−control study. Our analysis showed that, compared with naturally ventilated areas, microbial loads were significantly lower in air-conditioned areas, but the incidence of infections increased if not properly managed. The use of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration not only decreased transmission of airborne bioaerosols and various microorganisms, but also reduced the risk of infections. By contrast, contaminated air-conditioning systems in hospital rooms were associated with a higher risk of patient infection. Cleaning and maintenance of such systems to recommended standards should be performed regularly and where appropriate, the installation of HEPA filters can effectively mitigate microbial contamination in the public areas of hospitals.","Ting Wu, Han; Shuang Li, Qiu; Chen Dai, Rong; Liu, Shan; Wu, Li; Mao, Wei; Hua Ji, Cong",Epidemiol Infect,281,32

To find small molecules with anti-feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) properties, we utilized a virtual screening technique to identify the active site on the viral protease for the binding of the available natural compounds. The protease 3CL (3CL(pro)) plays an important role in the replication cycle of FIPV and other viruses within the family Coronaviridae. The 15 best-ranked candidate consensus compounds, based on three docking tools, were evaluated for further assays. The protease inhibitor assay on recombinant FIPV 3CL(pro) was performed to screen the inhibitory effect of the candidate compounds with IC(50) ranging from 6.36 ± 2.15 to 78.40 ± 2.60 μM. As determined by the cell-based assay, the compounds NSC345647, NSC87511, and NSC343256 showed better EC(50) values than the broad-spectrum antiviral drug ribavirin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir, under all the test conditions including pre-viral entry, post-viral entry, and prophylactic activity. The NSC87511 particularly yielded the best selective index (>4; range of SI = 13.80–22.90). These results indicated that the natural small-molecular compounds specifically targeted the 3CL(pro) of FIPV and inhibited its replication. Structural modification of these compounds may generate a higher anti-viral potency for the further development of a novel therapy against FIP.","Theerawatanasirikul, Sirin; Kuo, Chih Jung; Phetcharat, Nanthawan; Lekcharoensuk, Porntippa",Antiviral Res,281,30

AIM: We aimed to evaluate COVID-19 effect on the number of stroke code activations and timings during the first two months of the pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed the stroke code database of a single comprehensive stroke centre in Portugal for the number of activations through 2019-2020. We compared the pathway timings between March and April 2020 (COVID-19 period) and the homologous months of the previous four years (pre-COVID-19 period), whilst using February as a control. RESULTS: Monthly stroke code activation rates decreased up to 34.2% during COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, we observed an increase in the time from symptom onset to emergency call, with a significant number of patients waiting more than four hours (March 20.8% vs. 6.8%, p = 0.034; April 23.8% vs. 6%, p = 0.01); as well as an increase in the time from symptom onset to hospital arrival (March: median 136 minutes [IQR 106-410] vs. 100 [IQR 64-175], p = 0.001; April: median 188 [IQR 96-394] vs. 98 [IQR 66-168], p = 0.007). No difference between both periods was found concerning in-hospital times, patient characteristics, stroke/mimic diagnosis, stroke severity, and mortality. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 related factors probably reduced healthcare services utilization, and delayed emergency calls and hospital arrival after stroke onset. These highlight the importance of health education to improve the effectiveness of medical assistance.

The data for this review was collected from four databases: Pubmed/Medline, NIH Litcovid, Embase, and Cochrane library and Preprint servers up till 30 June 2020. Search strategy comprised of a range of keywords from relevant medical subject headings which includes “SARS-COV-2,” “COVID-19,” and “meningoencephalitis.” All peer reviewed, case–control, case report, pre print articles satisfying our inclusion criteria were involved in the study. Quantitative data was expressed in mean ± SD, while the qualitative date in percentages. Paired t test was used for analysing the data based on differences between mean and respective values with a p < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. A total of 61 cases were included from 25 studies after screening from databases and preprint servers, out of which 54 of them had completed investigation profile and were included in the final analysis. Clinical, laboratory findings, neuroimaging abnormalities, and EEG findings were analyzed in detail. This present review summarizes the available evidences related to the occurrence of meningoencephalitis in COVID-19.","Mondal, Ritwick; Ganguly, Upasana; Deb, Shramana; Shome, Gourav; Pramanik, Subhasish; Bandyopadhyay, Deebya; Lahiri, Durjoy",J Neurovirol,281,24

The piglets were inoculated intratracheally with 10(7.5) 50% egg infective dose [EID(50)] Swine/Belgium/1/98 (H1N1) SIV and were euthanased at time-points between 0 and 120 h post-inoculation (PI). Broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lung homogenates and sera were examined for inflammatory mediators by bioassay or ELISA. Interferon (IFN)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α peaked in BALF 24–30 h PI, when virus titres and the severity of clinical signs were maximal. Whereas IFN-γ and IL-12, but not IL-18, increased in tandem in BALF, serum cytokine concentrations were either undetectable or were up to 100-fold lower. The APP C-reactive protein (CRP) and haptoglobin peaked 24 h later than the cytokines and reached higher levels in serum than in BALF. In contrast, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP) only increased in BALF. Lung virus titres tightly correlated with BALF IFN-α, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-12, as well as with serum IL-6, IFN-α and IFN-γ. Signs of disease correlated with the same cytokines in BALF and serum, as well as with BALF LBP and serum CRP. The findings suggest that IFN-γ and IL-12 play a role in the pathogenesis of SIV and that APPs are induced by cytokines. This influenza infection model may have value in assessing the therapeutic potential of cytokine antagonists.","Barbé, Filip; Atanasova, Kalina; Van Reeth, Kristien",Vet J,281,16

Productive SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on viral entry into cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Indeed, viral entry into cells is mostly mediated by the early interaction between the viral spike protein S and its ACE2 receptor. The S/ACE2 complex is, thus, the first contact point between the incoming virus and its cellular target; consequently, it has been considered an attractive therapeutic target. To further characterize this interaction and the cellular processes engaged in the entry step of the virus, we set up various in silico, in vitro and in cellulo approaches that allowed us to specifically monitor the S/ACE2 association. We report here a novel computational model of the SARS-CoV-2 S/ACE2 complex as well as its biochemical and biophysical monitoring using pulldown, AlphaLISA and biolayer interferometry (BLI) binding assays. This led us to determine the kinetic parameters of the S/ACE2 association and dissociation steps. In parallel to these in vitro approaches, we developed in cellulo transduction assays using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and HEK293T-ACE2 cell lines generated in-house. This allowed us to recapitulate the early replication stage of the infection mediated by the S/ACE2 interaction and to detect cell fusion induced by the interaction. Finally, a cell imaging system was set up to directly monitor the S/ACE2 interaction in a cellular context, and a flow cytometry assay was developed to quantify this association at the cell surface. Together, these different approaches are available for both basic and clinical research aiming to characterize the entry step of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and its variants as well as to investigate the possible chemical modulation of this interaction. All these models will help in identifying new antiviral agents and new chemical tools for dissecting the virus entry step.","Lapaillerie, D.; Charlier, C.; Fernandes, H.

Although lipids have been shown to possess antiviral efficacy, little is currently known about lipid compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding and entry properties. To address this issue, we screened, overall, 17 polyunsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids, as wells as lipid-soluble vitamins. In performing target-based ligand screening utilizing the RBD-SARS-CoV-2 sequence, we observed that polyunsaturated fatty acids most effectively interfere with binding to hACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Using a spike protein pseudo-virus, we also found that linolenic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid significantly block the entry of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, eicosapentaenoic acid showed higher efficacy than linolenic acid in reducing activity of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L proteases, but neither of the fatty acids affected their expression at the protein level. Also, neither reduction of hACE2 activity nor binding to the hACE2 receptor upon treatment with these two fatty acids was observed. Although further in vivo experiments are warranted to validate the current findings, our study provides a new insight into the role of lipids as antiviral compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 strain.","Goc, Anna; Niedzwiecki, Aleksandra; Rath, Matthias",Sci Rep,281,9

Our aim was to assess the potential effectiveness and safety of antiviral agents for COVID-19 in children. Methods: Electronic databases from their inception to March, 31 2020 were searched for randomized controlled trials, clinical controlled trials and cohort studies of interventions with antiviral agents for children (less than 18 years of age) with COVID-19. Results: A total of 23 studies of indirect evidence with 6008 patients were included. The risks of bias in all studies were moderate to high in general. The effectiveness and safety of antiviral agents for children with COVID-19 is uncertain: For adults with COVID-19, lopinavir/ritonavir had no effect on mortality (risk ratio [RR]= 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 1.30) and probability of negative PCR test (RR=0.98, 95 CI% 0.82 to 1.18). Arbidol had no benefit on probability of negative PCR test (RR=1.27, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.73). Hydroxychloroquine was not associated with increasing the probability of negative PCR result (RR=0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18). For adults with SARS, interferon was associated with reduced corticosteroid dose (weighted mean difference [WMD]=-0.14 g, 95% CI -0.21 to -0.07) but had no effect on mortality (RR=0.72, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.88); ribavirin did not reduce mortality (RR=0.68, 95% CI % 0.43 to 1.06) and was associated with high risk of severe adverse reactions; and oseltamivir had no effect on mortality (RR=0.87, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.38). Ribavirin combined with interferon was also not effective in adults with MERS and associated with adverse reactions. Conclusions: There is no evidence showing the effectiveness of antiviral agents for children with COVID-19, and the clinical efficacy of existing antiviral agents is still uncertain. We do not suggest clinical routine use of antivirals for COVID-19 in children, with the exception of clinical trials.

Virtually all viruses have developed means to counteract the induction, signaling or antiviral actions of the IFN circuit. Over 170 different virus-encoded IFN-antagonists from 93 distinct viruses have been described up to now, indicating that most viruses interfere with multiple stages of the IFN response. Although every viral IFN antagonist is unique in its own right, four main mechanisms are employed to circumvent innate immune responses: i) general inhibition of cellular gene expression, and ii) sequestration, iii) proteolytic cleavage or iv) proteasomal degradation of key components of the IFN system. The increasing understanding of how different viral IFN antagonists function has been translated to the generation of viruses with mutant IFN antagonists as potential live vaccine candidates.

ACE2, an 805-amino acid monocarboxypeptidase type I transmembrane glycoprotein, was discovered in 2000 and has sequence similarity to two other proteins, namely ACE and collectrin. The ACE2 gene is located on Xp22 and is highly polymorphic. ACE2 is expressed in numerous tissues especially the lung alveolar epithelial cells, heart, kidney and gastrointestinal tract. Animal studies have found that ACE2 is central in diseases affecting almost all organ systems, among other cardiac, respiratory, renal and endocrine functions. ACE2 was identified as the cellular contact point for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the global pandemic (COVID-19), and is a potential drug target. SARS-CoV-2 infection has several effects on the renin–angiotensin system and conversely, regulation of this receptor may affect the progress of infection. We describe the genetics and functions of ACE2, explore its various physiological functions in the renin–angiotensin system and discuss its role in the pathophysiology of disease. ACE2 opposes the vasopressor ACE pathway of the renin–angiotensin system by converting angiotensin (Ang) I to Ang (1–9) and Ang II to Ang (1–7) which initiates the vasodilatory pathway. ACE2 may have a protective effect in the lung and kidney as knockout mice display susceptibility to acute respiratory distress and hypertensive nephropathy. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent fusion and downregulation of this pathway during SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain some of the unusual sequelae seen in COVID-19.","Wiese, Owen; Zemlin, Annalise E; Pillay, Tahir S",J Clin Pathol,281,20

Much is known about disruption of chromatin-modifying enzymes in malignant disease, but knowledge of irregular epigenetics in immune-driven disorders is just emerging. Epigenetic factors, such as DNA or histone modifications, are indispensable for precise gene expression in diverse immune cell types. Thus a disruption of epigenetic landscapes likely has a large impact on immune homeostasis. Moreover, the low concordance rates for most autoimmune diseases suggest that epigenetics contribute to immune tolerance disturbance. Here we review the important role of epigenetics for initiation, maintenance, tolerance, and training of immune responses. We discuss evolving evidence that DNA/histone modifications and chromatin-modifying enzymes are altered in immune-based diseases. Furthermore, we explore the potential of small molecules targeting epigenetic machinery, some of which are already used in oncology, as a way to reset the immune response in disease.","Mehta, S.; Jeffrey, K.L.",Medical Epigenetics,281,16

Anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies were found in 10% of the patients. Seropositivity increased with age and 41% of seropositive patients had no known exposure. Children under 6 years of age had higher initial antibody levels than older children, followed by a steeper decline. The seropositivity rate did not vary during the study, despite schools re‐opening. The findings suggest that children's immunity may start falling 4 months after the initial infection. CONCLUSION: Immunity started falling after just 4 months, and re‐opening schools did not affect infection rates.

METHODS: A total of 465 patients with a history of testing positive for COVID-19 were identified and their medical records reviewed. After a thorough review, utilizing the DELPHI methods by an expert panel, 42 (9%) cases were identified with persistent central sensitization (CS) symptoms persisting after the resolution of acute COVID-19, herein referred to as Post COVID syndrome (PoCoS). In this report we describe the baseline characteristics of these PoCoS patients. RESULTS: Among these 42 PoCoS patients, the mean age was 46.2 years (median age was 46.5 years). Pain (90%), fatigue (74%), dyspnea (43%), and orthostatic intolerance (38%) were the most common symptoms. The characteristics of an initial 14 patients were utilized for the development of clinical criteria via a modified Delphi Method by a panel of experts in central sensitization disorders. These criteria were subsequently applied in the identification of 28 additional cases of suspected PoCoS. A 2-reviewer system was used to analyze agreement with using the criteria, with all 28 cases determined to be either probable or possible cases by the reviewers. Inter-reviewer agreement using these proposed defining criteria was high with a Cohen’s alpha of .88.

A cross-sectional study was conducted with 723 participants in China from April 26 to May 9, 2020. We evaluated the psychosomatic status, including depression, anxiety, quality of life, somatic symptoms, stress, sleep disturbances, and posttraumatic stress symptoms in different exposure groups. We explored the risk factors that affect psychosomatic burdens and analyzed the relationship between psychosomatic problems and medical occupations. We found that the psychosomatic burdens of medical staff were significantly greater than those of non-medical staff (p < 0.01) and were positively related with the number of COVID-19 patients they came in contact with. Occupational pressure was a key factor for healthcare staff's psychosomatic problems (p < 0.01 for quality of life, somatic symptoms, anxiety, depression, stress; p = 0.012 for sleep disturbances), and it had a strong canonical correlation (p < 0.01). Workload and time allocation (WTA), one of the subdimensional indicators of occupational pressure, was strongly correlated with psychosomatic indicators. We suggest that rationalization of WTA is a desirable approach for anti-epidemic medical employees to alleviate psychosomatic burdens. Public health interventions should be undertaken to reduce the occupational pressure on this special population, which is critical for mitigation. This study presents results regarding the psychosomatic burdens of the healthcare workforce related to occupational pressure and provides multilevel data with groups of different exposure risks for policymakers to protect medical personnel.

Decisions about how to allocate limited supplies of vaccines need to be clear about the criteria used in setting priorities, with a specific commitment to transparency and communication. The aim of our study was to think through these competing demands, focusing on the opinion of healthcare workers (HCWs). The primary endpoint of the study was to assess the opinion of all the HCWs in a University based Italian Hospital about the fairest priority order to COVID 19 vaccines and to understand on which criteria the prioritization preferences of HCWs are implicitly based. The secondary endpoints were to assess whether HCWs approach differs from national guidelines and to assess the attitude of HCWs towards mandatory vaccination. An online survey accounting with multiple choice single answer questions and ranking questions was administered to all the HCWs of the University Hospital P. Giaccone of Palermo (Italy) and completed by a total of 465 participants. Almost all respondents confirmed the need for prioritization in COVID-19 vaccination for HCWs (n = 444; 95.5%), essential services and law enforcement (both n = 428; 92%). Clinically vulnerable individuals, HCWs and population over 65 years have been considered the first three groups to be involved in getting vaccination, being indicated as first position group by 26.5%, 32.5% and 21.9% of respondents, respectively. A large majority of respondents (85%) asked for a consistent, transparent and detailed order of priority at a national level. After adjusting for potential confounding due to sex and age, physicians have been found to be statistically significantly associated with the choice of mandatory vaccination (odds ratio (OR): 10.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.7–39.1) or with other strategies different from voluntary (OR = 7.2; 95% CI = 1.9–27.3). The broad consensus expressed by respondents towards mandatory vaccination for HCWs is extremely relevant at a time when vaccination hesitation is one of the biggest obstacles to achieving herd immunity. Data show a mismatch in the position attributed to long-term care residents compared to the position of absolute priority assigned by most of national distribution plans, impelling us to reflect on the issue of maximizing benefit from limited healthcare resources. Our findings clearly indicate a preference for COVID-19 frontline health professionals as the first tier of recipients, since they better meet all the criteria (higher risk, immediate system stability). As the guidelines are likely to directly affect a considerable number of citizens, our results call for policy interventions to inform people on the ethical rationale behind vaccine distribution decisions, to avoid resentment and feelings of unfairness.","Craxì, Lucia; Casuccio, Alessandra; Amodio, Emanuele; Restivo, Vincenzo",Vaccines (Basel),281,3

Regiochemistry of the functionalization was achieved with the aid of 5-endo-dig electrophilic halocyclization of acetyl 5-p-tolyl- or 5-p-pentylphenyl-2'-deoxyuridine. Structure of one of the resulting nucleosides, 6-p-tolyl-5-iodo-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl-furo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-one, was confirmed by X-ray crystallography, and its conformation was compared to related nucleosides. Diverse alkynyl substituents were introduced at the heterobicyclic base C-5 position via Sonogashira coupling of 5-iodo-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl-furo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-ones. The resulting compounds had fluorescence emissions of 452 to 481 nm. High quantum yields of 0.53-0.60 were observed for 9-ethynyl-9-fluorenol and propargyl alcohol/methyl ether-modified furopyrimidines. These modified nucleosides, designed in the form of ribose acetyl esters, represent potential tools for fluorescent tagging, studying nucleoside metabolism, 2′-deoxyribonucleoside kinase activity, and antiviral activity. Antiviral assays against a broad spectrum of DNA and RNA viruses showed that in human embryonic lung (HEL) cell cultures some of the compounds showed antiviral activity (EC(50) 1.3-13.2 μM) against varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The alkynyl furopyrimidine with two p-pentylphenyl substituents emerged as the best compound with reasonable and selective anti-VZV activity, confirming p-pentylphenyl potency as a pharmacophore.","Kaczmarek, Renata; Twardy, Dylan; Olson, Trevor; Korczyński, Dariusz; Andrei, Graciela; Snoeck, Robert; Dolot, Rafał; Wheeler, Kraig A.; Dembinski, Roman",Eur J Med Chem,281,16

The virus is responsible for an ongoing pandemic and concomitant public health crisis around the world. While vaccine development is proving to be highly successful, parallel drug development approaches are also critical in the response to SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging viruses. Coronaviruses require Ca2+ ions for host cell entry and we have previously shown that Ca2+ modulates the interaction of the viral fusion peptide with host cell membranes. In an attempt to accelerate drug development, we tested a panel of L-type calcium channel blocker (CCB) drugs currently developed for other conditions, to determine whether they would inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture. All the CCBs tested showed varying degrees of inhibition, with felodipine and nifedipine strongly limiting SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection in epithelial lung cells at concentrations where cell toxicity was minimal. Further studies with pseudo-typed particles displaying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein suggested that inhibition occurs at the level of virus entry. Overall, our data suggest that certain CCBs have potential to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections and are worthy of further examination for possible treatment of COVID-19.","Straus, Marco R.; Bidon, Miya K.; Tang, Tiffany; Jaimes, Javier A.; Whittaker, Gary R.; Daniel, Susan",bioRxiv,281,1

Methods: This was an ambispective observational cohort study, and 133 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included and all symptoms over the course were analyzed qualitatively. The symptoms, their changes over the course in the cohort and in the different clinical types, etc. were illustrated. Differences in different periods and severities were analyzed through Chi square test, association with severity was analyzed through LASSO binomial logistic regression analysis. Inter-correlation and classification of symptoms were completed. Major symptoms were screened and their changes were illustrated. Results: A total of 43 symptoms with frequencies as 6067 in this cohort. Differences of symptoms in different stages and clinical types were significant. Expectoration, shortness of breath, dyspnea, diarrhea, poor appetite were positively but vomiting, waist discomfort, pharyngeal discomfort, acid reflux were negatively correlated with the combined-severe and critical type; dyspnea was correlated with the critical type. The 17 major symptoms were identified. The average daily frequency of symptoms per case was decreased continuously before the transition into the severe type and increased immediately one day before the transition and then decreased. It was decreased continuously before the transition date of the critical type and increased from the transition into the critical type to the next day and decreased thereafter. Dyspnea (P<0.001), shortness of breath (P<0.01) and chest distress (P<0.05) were correlated with death and their corresponding coefficient was 0.393, 0.258, 0.214, respectively. Conclusion: The symptoms of COVID-19 patients mainly related to upper respiratory tract infection, cardiopulmonary function, and digestive system. The mild type and the early stage in other types mainly related to upper respiratory tract infection. The cardiopulmonary function and digestive system associated symptoms were found in all other types and stages. Dyspnea was correlated with critical type, and dyspnea, shortness of breath and chest distress were correlated with death. Respiratory dysfunction (or incompleteness) associated symptoms were the characteristic symptoms. The changes of symptoms did not synchronously with the changes of severity before the transition into the severe or critical type.","Qu, Gaojing; Chen, Junwen; Huang, Guoxin; Zhang, Meiling; Yu, Hui; Zhu, Haoming; Chen, Lei; Wang, Dengru; Pei, Bin",Int J Med Sci,281,1

But, for citizens, it is not always simple to understand how these measures have been taken. Should they have been more (or less) restrictive? Should the lockdown period have been longer (or shorter)? What would have been the benefits of starting to confine the population earlier? To provide some elements of response to these questions, we propose a simple behavior model for the government decision-making operation. Although simple and obviously improvable, the proposed model has the merit to implement in a pragmatic and insightful way the tradeoff between health and macroeconomic aspects. For a given tradeoff between the assumed cost functions for the economic and health impacts, it is then possible to determine the best lockdown starting date, the best lockdown duration, and the optimal severity levels during and after lockdown. The numerical analysis is based on a standard SEIR model and performed for the case of France but the adopted approach can be applied to any country. Our analysis, based on the proposed model, shows that for France it would have been possible to have just a quarter of the actual number of people infected (over [March 1, August 31]), while simultaneously having a Gross Domestic Product loss about 30% smaller than the one expected with the current policy.","Lasaulce, S.; SATHEESKUMAR VARMA, V.; Morarescu, C.",,281,1

For the CC, as for any multiparental population (MPP), effective experimental design and analysis benefit from detailed knowledge of the genetic differences between strains. Such differences can be directly determined by sequencing, but until now whole-genome sequencing was not publicly available for individual CC strains. An alternative and complementary approach is to infer genetic differences by combining two pieces of information: probabilistic estimates of the CC haplotype mosaic from a custom genotyping array, and probabilistic variant calls from sequencing of the CC founders. The computation for this inference, especially when performed genome-wide, can be intricate and time-consuming, requiring the researcher to generate nontrivial and potentially error-prone scripts. To provide standardized, easy-to-access CC sequence information, we have developed the Inbred Strain Variant Database (ISVdb). The ISVdb provides, for all the exonic variants from the Sanger Institute mouse sequencing dataset, direct sequence information for CC founders and, critically, the imputed sequence information for CC strains. Notably, the ISVdb also: (1) provides predicted variant consequence metadata; (2) allows rapid simulation of F1 populations; and (3) preserves imputation uncertainty, which will allow imputed data to be refined in the future as additional sequencing and genotyping data are collected. The ISVdb information is housed in an SQL database and is easily accessible through a custom online interface (http://isvdb.unc.edu), reducing the analytic burden on any researcher using the CC.","Oreper, Daniel; Cai, Yanwei; Tarantino, Lisa M.; de Villena, Fernando Pardo-Manuel; Valdar, William",G3 (Bethesda),281,26

As a social media platform with billions of daily views, YouTube has tremendous potential to both support and hinder public health efforts. However, the usefulness and accuracy of most viewed YouTube videos on COVID-19 have not been investigated. METHODS: A YouTube search was performed on 21 March 2020 using keywords ‘coronavirus’ and ‘COVID-19’, and the top 75 viewed videos from each search were analysed. Videos that were duplicates, non-English, non-audio and non-visual, exceeding 1 hour in duration, live and unrelated to COVID-19 were excluded. Two reviewers coded the source, content and characteristics of included videos. The primary outcome was usability and reliability of videos, analysed using the novel COVID-19 Specific Score (CSS), modified DISCERN (mDISCERN) and modified JAMA (mJAMA) scores. RESULTS: Of 150 videos screened, 69 (46%) were included, totalling 257 804 146 views. Nineteen (27.5%) videos contained non-factual information, totalling 62 042 609 views. Government and professional videos contained only factual information and had higher CSS than consumer videos (mean difference (MD) 2.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 4.32, p=0.037); mDISCERN scores than consumer videos (MD 2.46, 95% CI 0.50 to 4.42, p=0.008), internet news videos (MD 2.20, 95% CI 0.19 to 4.21, p=0.027) and entertainment news videos (MD 2.57, 95% CI 0.66 to 4.49, p=0.004); and mJAMA scores than entertainment news videos (MD 1.21, 95% CI 0.07 to 2.36, p=0.033) and consumer videos (MD 1.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.44, p=0.028). However, they only accounted for 11% of videos and 10% of views. CONCLUSION: Over one-quarter of the most viewed YouTube videos on COVID-19 contained misleading information, reaching millions of viewers worldwide. As the current COVID-19 pandemic worsens, public health agencies must better use YouTube to deliver timely and accurate information and to minimise the spread of misinformation. This may play a significant role in successfully managing the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Heidi Oi-Yee; Bailey, Adrian; Huynh, David; Chan, James",BMJ Glob Health,281,3

Coronavirus neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were recently reported to last for a certain period. The factors affecting nAbs’ existence remain unclear. Here, we retrospectively analyzed the factors correlating with nAbs’ from SARS-CoV-1 long-term convalescence HCWs in Taiwan. One hundred and thirty SARS-CoV-1 convalescent patients were recruited between August 2006 and March 2007. Blood samples were collected to determine the anti-nucleocapsid (N) and anti-spike (S) antibodies’ existence status and neutralization ability. Neutralization ability was measured using SARS-CoV-1 pseudotyped viruses. Statistical analysis of factors associated with anti-SARS-CoV-1 antibodies’ existence status was determined using SAS software. 46.2% SARS-CoV-1 convalescent patients presented anti-N antibody after three years post-infection. Among sixty participants, ten participants co-presented anti-S antibodies. Eight participants with anti-S antibody displayed neutralization ability to SARS-CoV-1. The gender, age, and disease severity of participants did not affect the anti-N antibody existence status, whereas the anti-S antibody is significantly reduced in participants with old age (>50 years, p = 0.0434) after three years post SARS-CoV-1 infection. This study suggests that age is an important factor correlated with the duration of SARS-CoV-1 protective antibody existence status.","Huang, Szu-Wei; Urbina, Aspiro Nayim; Chen, Yi-Ming Arthur; Wang, Sheng-Fan",Pathogens,281,22

Benefit/risk stratification is an important part of this process. We have stratified EDX studies into 3 categories: Urgent, Non‐urgent and Possibly Urgent, in an effort to help clinicians triage these referrals. For each category, we provide a rationale and some examples. However, each referral must be reviewed on a case‐by‐case basis, and the clinical situation will evolve over time, necessitating flexibility in managing EDX triaging.

METHODS: In our study, 102 volunteers experiencing upper airway infection were recruited over the winter and early spring of 2008/2009 and the first half of the winter of 2009/2010. Ninety-nine EBCs were successfully obtained and screened for 14 commonly circulating respiratory viruses. To investigate the efficiency of virus isolation from EBC, a nasal swab was taken in parallel from a subset of volunteers. The combined use of the ECoVent device with the RTube™ allowed the registration of the exhaled volume and breathing frequency during collection. In this way, the number of exhaled viral particles per liter air or per minute can theoretically be estimated. RESULTS: Viral screening resulted in the detection of 4 different viruses in EBC and/or nasal swabs: Rhinovirus, Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus B, Influenza A and Influenza B. Rhinovirus was detected in 6 EBCs and 1 EBC was Influenza B positive. We report a viral detection rate of 7% for the EBCs, which is much lower than the detection rate of 46.8% observed using nasal swabs.

In this paper, we studied the role of recombinant NS1 proteins representing the four dengue serotypes, and their role in promoting the expression and release of endocan, which is a highly specific biomarker of endothelial cell activation. We evaluated mRNA expression and the levels of endocan protein in vitro following the stimulation of HUVEC and HMEC-1 cell lines with recombinant NS1 proteins. NS1 proteins increase endocan mRNA expression 48 h post-activation in both endothelial cell lines. Endocan mRNA expression levels were higher in HUVEC and HMEC-1 cells stimulated with NS1 proteins than in non-stimulated cells (p < 0.05). A two-fold to three-fold increase in endocan protein release was observed after the stimulation of HUVECs or HMEC-1 cells with NS1 proteins compared with that in non-stimulated cells (p < 0.05). The blockade of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) signaling on HMEC-1 cells with an antagonistic antibody prevented NS1-dependent endocan production. Dengue-infected patients showed elevated serum endocan levels (≥30 ng/mL) during early dengue infection. High endocan serum levels were associated with laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, and are associated with the presence of NS1 in the serum.","Domínguez-Alemán, Carlos Alonso; Sánchez-Vargas, Luis Alberto; Hernández-Flores, Karina Guadalupe; Torres-Zugaide, Andrea Isabel; Reyes-Sandoval, Arturo; Cedillo-Barrón, Leticia; Remes-Ruiz, Ricardo; Vivanco-Cid, Héctor",Microorganisms,281,16

Multiple linear regression was used to analyze factors related to resilience. RESULTS: The total resilience score was 65.76±17.26, wherein the toughness dimension score was 33.61±9.52, the strength dimension score was 21.25±5.50, and the optimism dimension score was 10.91±3.15.

In sub-Sahara Africa (SSA), several prioritizations of zoonoses and transboundary animal diseases (TADs) have been implemented at different scales to characterize potential disease impacts. Method and principal findings: In this systematic review, we analyze the methodologies used, outcomes, and their relevance by discussing criteria required to align decision-makers’ perceptions of impacts to those of other stakeholders for different prioritization in SSA. In general, the sectorial representativeness of stakeholders for processes implemented with the support of international partners showed slight differences with the absence of local stakeholders. Whatever the tool prioritized, zoonoses were similar in general because of the structured nature of those tools in assessing decision-makers’ preferences through value trade-offs between criteria while ensuring transparency and reproducibility. However, by involving field practitioners and farmers, there were different outcomes with processes concerning only decision makers and experts who were more sensitive to infectious TADs, while the former raised parasitic disease constraints. In this context, multicriteria decision analysis-based zoonoses and TADs prioritizations involving a balanced participation of stakeholders might contribute to bridging these divergences, whatever the scale. Conclusion and significance: Prioritization processes were important steps toward building and harmonizing technical laboratory and surveillance networks to coordinate projects to address priority zoonoses and TADs at the country and/or sub-regional level.

Media representations of unfolding events, scientific uncertainty, and real and perceived risks shape public acceptance of health policy and therefore policy outcomes. To characterize and track views in popular circulation on the causes, consequences and appropriate policy responses to the emergence of Hendra virus as a zoonotic risk, this study examines coverage of this issue in Australian mass media for the period 2007–2011. Results demonstrate the predominant explanation for the emergence of Hendra became the encroachment of flying fox populations on human settlement. Depictions of scientific uncertainty as to whom and what was at risk from Hendra virus promoted the view that flying foxes were a direct risk to human health. Descriptions of the best strategy to address Hendra have become polarized between recognized health authorities advocating individualized behaviour changes to limit risk exposure; versus populist calls for flying fox control and eradication. Less than a quarter of news reports describe the ecological determinants of emerging infectious disease or upstream policy solutions. Because flying foxes rather than horses were increasingly represented as the proximal source of human infection, existing policies of flying fox protection became equated with government inaction; the plight of those affected by flying foxes representative of a moral failure. These findings illustrate the potential for health communications for emerging infectious disease risks to become entangled in other political agendas, with implications for the public's likelihood of supporting public policy and risk management strategies that require behavioural change or seek to address the ecological drivers of incidence.","Degeling, Chris; Kerridge, Ian",Soc Sci Med,281,8

Following unprecedented rapid global spread, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Although data on disease in humans are emerging at a steady pace, certain aspects of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 can only be studied in detail in animal models, where repeated sampling and tissue collection is possible. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 causes respiratory disease in infected rhesus macaques, with disease lasting 8–16 days. Pulmonary infiltrates, a hallmark of human disease, were visible in lung radiographs of all animals. High viral loads were detected in swabs from the nose and throat of all animals as well as in bronchoalveolar lavages; in one animal we observed prolonged rectal shedding. Taken together, the rhesus macaque recapitulates moderate disease observed in the majority of human cases. The establishment of the rhesus macaque as a model of COVID-19 will increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease and will aid development and testing of medical countermeasures.","Munster, Vincent J.; Feldmann, Friederike; Williamson, Brandi N.; van Doremalen, Neeltje; Pérez-Pérez, Lizzette; Schulz, Jonathan; Meade-White, Kimberly; Okumura, Atsushi; Callison, Julie; Brumbaugh, Beniah; Avanzato, Victoria A.; Rosenke, Rebecca; Hanley, Patrick W.; Saturday, Greg; Scott, Dana; Fischer, Elizabeth R.; de Wit, Emmie",bioRxiv,281,1

We performed a cross-sectional study among 648 pregnant women in Fort Portal, Uganda, after the first lockdown starting in June 2020. Structured interviews were conducted at three different facilities during routine antenatal care, assessing sociodemographic background, knowledge of COVID-19, prevention behavior adherence, and psycho-emotional stress levels. We performed descriptive analyses and examined associated factors using multivariable logistic regression. In Fort Portal Region, 32.8% of pregnant women had a higher knowledge regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, while all women at least heard of COVID-19. 88.6% of the women showed low self-reported prevention behavior adherence. More than one third of the pregnant women experienced high psycho-emotional stress related to the pandemic (39.8%). The odds for psycho-emotional stress were increased among the age group 21–30 years (AOR 1.97; 95% CI 1.18–3.35) compared to women under the age of 21, and decreased in single or divorced women compared to women in partnerships (AOR 0.42; 0.22–0.77) and in women having less COVID-19-related knowledge (AOR 0.40; 0.27–0.58). In conclusion, prevention behavior adherence seemed challenging, and psycho-emotional stress was ubiquitous among our cohort. To avoid adverse consequences in maternal and neonatal health, campaigns for hygiene but also women’s emotional state should be a major focus of community healthcare in exceptional times such as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Theuring, Stefanie; Kengonzi, Agnes; Hafermann, Lorena; Herrmann, Carolin; Kabwama, Steven Ndugwa; Rubaihayo, John",Int J Environ Res Public Health,281,27

We apply relational hyperevent models on 19,713 individuals with 13,377 infection ties to determine to what degree the disease spread is affected by age whilst controlling for other covariate and human-to-human transmission network effects. We find that positive cases are more likely to nominate alters of similar age as their sources of infection, thus providing evidence for age homophily. We also show that the relative infection risk is negatively associated with the age of peers, such that the risk of infection increases as the average age of contacts decreases. Additionally, we find that adults between the ages 35 and 44 are pivotal in the transmission of the disease to other age groups. Our results may contribute to better controlling future COVID-19 waves, and they also point to the key age groups which may be essential for vaccination given their prominent role in the transmission of the virus.","Hâncean, Marian-Gabriel; Lerner, Jürgen; Perc, Matjaž; Ghiţă, Maria Cristina; Bunaciu, David-Andrei; Stoica, Adelina Alexandra; Mihăilă, Bianca-Elena",J Complex Netw,281,16

We assess the clinical features and outcome of these infections. METHODS: In this retrospective single-centre, case-control study, we included 54 patients with CPE infection: 30 case-patients (COVID-19) and 24 controls (non-COVID-19), collected between March and May 2020. We compared the epidemiological, clinical features, and outcome between cases and controls. RESULTS: CPE infection was more frequent in COVID-19 patients than in controls (1.1 vs. 0.5%, p = .005). COVID-19 patients were younger, had a lower frequency of underlying diseases (p = .01), and a lower median Charlson score (p = .002). Predisposing factors such as antimicrobial use, mechanical ventilation, or ICU admission, were more frequent in COVID-19 patients (p < .05). There were 73 episodes of infection (42 cases and 31 controls) that were more frequently hospital-acquired and diagnosed at the ICU in COVID-19 patients (p < .001). Urinary tract was the most common source of infection (47.9%), followed by pneumonia (23.3%). The frequency of severe sepsis or shock (p = .01) as well as the median SOFA score (p = .04) was higher in cases than in controls. Klebsiella pneumoniae (80.8%), Serratia marcescens (11%) and Enterobacter cloacae (4.1%) were the most common bacteria in both groups (KPC 56.2%, OXA-48 26% and VIM 17.8%). Overall 30-d mortality rate of COVID-19 patients and controls was 30 and 16.7%, respectively (p = .25).

On day 33 after becoming symptomatic, the patient received CP containing high-titer (ID(50) > 5,000) neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), defervesced, and improved clinically within 48 h and was discharged on day 37. Hence, when present in sufficient quantities, NAbs to SARS-CoV-2 have clinical benefit even if administered relatively late in the disease course. However, analysis of additional CP units revealed widely varying NAb titers, with many recipients exhibiting endogenous NAb responses far exceeding those of the administered units.

Health practitioners all over the world are treating patients with currently available antiviral drugs, primarily the protease inhibitors used for HIV treatment. The present study mainly aims to evaluate the potencies of eight anti-HIV drugs to inhibit coronavirus protease using in silico methods. Derivation of pharmacophore, identification of hit molecules, and checking their virtual inhibition efficacies on the COVID-19 protease were also carried out in the present investigation. Classification of eight drug molecules (atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir (amprenavir—metabolised product), saquinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, and indinavir) based on their molecular structures was completed and reported. The X-ray crystallographic structure of the main protease of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 protease) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank and prepared for computational studies using Edu PyMOL software. Docking studies were performed with AutoDock Vina software, and the results were evaluated with Discovery Studio software. The binding scores of the drugs on protease followed the order saquinavir > nelfinavir > lopinavir = indinavir > darunavir > amprenavir > ritonavir > atazanavir. Web servers such as PharmaGist and ZINCPharmer were employed to derive the 3D pharmacophore and to identify potential hit compounds, respectively. The identified hit molecules were docked with the SARS-CoV-2 protease and analysed. A detailed account of the type of interaction between the protease and the molecules is discussed. The majority of hit compounds displayed appreciable binding affinities on coronavirus protease. Three hit compounds possess structures similar to that of natural products, viz., flavonoids, and nucleoside. These molecules were hydrophilic and slightly deviated from Lipinski parameters. All other derived molecules obeyed the Lipinski rule. In vitro, in vivo, and toxicological studies of these compounds have to be performed before checking the actual druggability of these compounds.","Raphael, Vinod P.; Shanmughan, Shaju K.",Adv Pharmacol Pharm Sci,281,29

The two-dimensional metal carbide and nitride (MXene) nanosheets can leverage the performance of various devices since they are highly tunable along with fascinating surface chemistry properties. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were exploited to investigate the interactions between urea and different MXene nanosheets. To this end, detailed analyses were performed that clarify the suitability of these nanostructures in urea adsorption. The atomistic simulations were carried out on Mn(2)C, Cd(2)C, Cu(2)C, Ti(2)C, W(2)C, Ta(2)C, and urea to determine the most appropriate urea-removing adsorbent.

RESULTS Prosocial motivation, but not gratitude, correlated with health behavior adherence and social distancing practice. Conversely, gratitude, but not prosocial motivation, correlated with emotional adjustment (daily accomplishments, meaning in life, thriving, psychological distress, positive and negative affect). Analyses controlled for gratitude/prosocial motivation, self-focused motivation, COVID-19 worries, work arrangement, stay-at-home order, likelihood of COVID-19 diagnosis, and demographics.

We evaluated the impact of this pre-existing cellular response on incident SARS CoV-2 infections. METHODS: Follow up study of 38 seronegative health care workers (HCWs) with previous evaluation of CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell response after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. Infection was considered in presence of a positive reverse transcription (RT)-PCR test and/or confirmed seroconversion. RESULTS: Twenty of the 38 HCWs included (53%) had a previous specific CD8+ T cell response to peptides encompassing the spike (S) protein in 13 (34%), the membrane (M, 17, 45%), or/and the nucleocapsid (N, 3, 8%). During a follow up of 189 days (interquartile range, IQR, 172 to 195), 11 (29%) HCWs had a RT-PCR positive test (n=9) or seroconverted (n=2). Median duration of symptoms was 2 days (IQR, 0-7), and time to negative RT-PCR was 9 days (IQR, 4-10). Notably, six incident infections (55%) occurred in HCWs with pre-existing T-cell response (30% of those with cellular response), who showed a significant lower duration of symptoms (three were asymptomatic). Three of the six HCWs having previous T-cell response continued testing seronegative. All the infected patient developed a robust T-cell response to different structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins, especially to protein S (91%). CONCLUSION: Pre-existing T-cell response does not seems to reduce incident SARS-CoV-2 infections, but it may contribute to asymptomatic or mild disease, rapid viral clearance and differences in seroconversion.","Casado, José L.; Häemmerle, Johannes; Vizcarra, Pilar; Velasco, Hector; Velasco, Tamara; Fernandez-Escribano, Marina; Vallejo, Alejandro",Clin Microbiol Infect,281,26

Here we investigate how flaviviruses exploit Src family kinases (SFKs) for exit from infected cells. We identify Lyn as a critical component for secretion of Dengue and Zika infectious particles and their corresponding virus like particles (VLPs). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of the SFKs, Lyn in particular, block virus secretion. Lyn(−/−) cells are impaired in virus release and are rescued when reconstituted with wild-type Lyn, but not a kinase- or palmitoylation-deficient Lyn mutant. We establish that virus particles are secreted in two distinct populations – one as free virions and the other enclosed within membranes. Lyn is critical for the latter, which consists of proteolytically processed, infectious virus progenies within autophagosome-derived vesicles. This process depends on Ulk1, Rab GTPases and SNARE complexes implicated in secretory but not degradative autophagy and occur with significantly faster kinetics than the conventional secretory pathway.

We aimed to: i) synthesise evidence describing the experiences of health and social care staff providing end-of-life care during a disease outbreak or humanitarian disaster, ii) understand the impact on their mental health and wellbeing and, iii) identify means of support. METHODS: A systematic review with meta-synthesis was conducted including studies of health and social care staff providing end-of-life care during disease outbreaks (Ebola, COVID-19, SARs, MERs) or humanitarian disasters (2001–2020). MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and grey literature databases were searched systematically, with forward and backward citation searching of included studies. Any research study designs, in any care settings, were included. Study quality was assessed using an appraisal tool relevant to each study design. Qualitative meta-synthesis was used to analyse the findings, which were then reported narratively. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020181444. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included, including 10 Ebola studies and two COVID-19 studies. The analysis generated two superordinate themes: individual experience and organisational responsibilities. Individual experience comprised four themes: dignity in death, positive experiences, negative experience and support for staff. Organisational responsibilities comprised four themes: preparation, adaption, resources, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). DISCUSSION: No studies quantitively measured the impact of providing end-of-life care on staff mental health and wellbeing, however qualitative studies described experiences in varied settings. Serious disease outbreaks and disasters can expose care staff to abnormally high levels of mortality and suffering. Health and social care systems need to proactively prepare for future events and enable peer support mechanisms that may help mitigate experiences of psychological distress in humanitarian crises.","Porter, Bryony; Zile, Amy; Peryer, Guy; Farquhar, Morag; Sanderson, Kristy",Soc Sci Med,281,2

Here we have used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, machine learning (ML), and free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations to elucidate the differences in RBD binding by the two viruses. Although only subtle differences were observed from the initial MD simulations of the two RBD-ACE2 complexes, ML identified the individual residues with the most distinctive ACE2 interactions, many of which have been highlighted in previous experimental studies. FEP calculations quantified the corresponding differences in binding free energies to ACE2, and examination of MD trajectories provided structural explanations for these differences. Lastly, the energetics of emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations were studied, showing that the affinity of the RBD for ACE2 is increased by N501Y and E484K mutations but is slightly decreased by K417N.","Pavlova, Anna; Zhang, Zijian; Acharya, Atanu; Lynch, Diane L.; Pang, Yui Tik; Mou, Zhongyu; Parks, Jerry M.; Chipot, Chris; Gumbart, James C.",bioRxiv,281,20

As a consequence, industries, including the agri-food sector, have put in place preventive measures to deal with this pandemic on several fronts, including the use of hydroalcoholic products and bleach for personal and surface disinfection. These disinfection actions may eliminate or reduce the risk of coronavirus infection, but the increased use of these products by employees could lead to serious health problems and increase the occupational chemical risk in the event of uncontrolled exposure. In order to analyze this risk in the dairy industry in Morocco, we have launched a qualitative and quantitative study to identify and assess the severity of chemical risk to which its employees are exposed. This involves an analysis of the safety data sheets [MSDS] of the disinfectants used and a health and safety survey of the users of these products, particularly for hand disinfection. This analysis showed that this chemical risk is omnipresent and prevention measures are partially adopted. Indeed, the strengthening of health safety measures to combat COVID-19 has significantly increased this risk, resulting in a remarkable imbalance in the assessment and management of occupational risks in this industry. These results have led us to propose corrective and preventive measures against this risk to interested parties and to adopt an integrated management of food and occupational health risks in a single system. This is the use of the Risk Analysis—Critical Control Points (HACCP)-Tool for a First Risk Assessment by Activity Analysis (OPERA) approach, which we developed and proposed in a previous study, for a simplified management of chemical risk in the food industry, especially in small- and medium-sized enterprises.","Rachidi, Hafida; Hamdaoui, Samir; Merimi, Imane; Bengourram, Jamae; Latrache, Hassan",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,281,1

OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical efficacy of HIVC on hyperinflammation among patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: The retrospective cohort study included inpatients with severe COVID-19, a subset of whom was treated with HIVC. The medical records were screened for demographic data, laboratory findings, medications, as well as initial and repeated values of multiple inflammatory markers for analysis. RESULTS: The percentages of patients presented hyperinflammation based on inflammatory markers levels above upper limit of normal (hs-CRP, 80.1%; IL-6, 91.5%; TNF-a, 67.4%). A total of 85 (36.0%) patients received HIVC therapy. After treatment with HIVC, the levels of inflammatory markers displayed significant decrease related to those among patients without HIVC. Furthermore, the percentages of reduction in inflammatory markers levels were higher in patients receiving HIVC compared with those in patients treated without HIVC. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that HIVC was independently associated with percentages of reduction in inflammatory markers levels.

Our results showed a statistically significant correlation between cases of COVID-19 and SARS in the community, and SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in the water. Based on the model, if the concentrations of SARS-CoV-RNA (N1 and N2 target regions) increase 10 times, there is an expected increase of 104% [95%CI: (62–157%)] and 92% [95%CI: (51–143%)], respectively, in the number of cases of COVID-19 and SARS.

Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola, cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses are major suspected pathogens of periodontitis, and a combined herpesvirus–bacterial periodontal infection can potentially explain major clinical features of the disease. Cytomegalovirus infects periodontal macrophages and T‐cells and elicits a release of interleukin‐1β and tumor necrosis factor‐α. These proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in the host defense against the virus, but they also have the potential to induce alveolar bone resorption and loss of periodontal ligament. Gingival fibroblasts infected with cytomegalovirus also exhibit diminished collagen production and release of an increased level of matrix metalloproteinases. This article reviews innate and adaptive immunity to cytomegalovirus and suggests that immune responses towards cytomegalovirus can play roles in controlling, as well as in exacerbating, destructive periodontal disease.","Contreras, Adolfo; Botero, Javier Enrique; Slots, Jørgen",Periodontol 2000,281,28

Simple and rapid immunodiagnostic methods are urgently needed to identify positive cases. Here we report the development of a rapid and sensitive lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) that uses lanthanide-doped polysterene nanoparticles (LNPs) to detect anti-SARV-CoV-2 IgG in human serum. A recombinant nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was dispensed onto a nitrocellulose membrane to capture specific IgG. Mouse anti-human IgG antibody was labeled with self-assembled LNPs that served as a fluorescent reporter. A 100-μL aliquot of serum samples (1:1000 dilution) was used for this assay and the whole detection process took 10 min. The results of the validation experiment met the requirements for clinical diagnostic reagents. A value of 0.0666 was defined as the cutoff value by assaying 51 normal samples. We tested 7 samples that were positive by reverse-transcription (RT-)PCR and 12 that were negative but clinically suspicious for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. One of the negative samples was determined to be SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive, while the results for the other samples were consistent with those obtained by RT-PCR. Thus, this assay can achieve rapid and sensitive detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in human serum and allow positive identification in suspicious cases; it can also be useful for monitoring the progression COVID-19 and evaluating patients’ response to treatment.","Chen, Zhenhua; Zhang, Zhigao; Zhai, Xiangming; Li, Yongyin; Lin, Li; Zhao, Hui; Bian, Lun; Li, Peng; Yu, Lei; Wu, Yingsong; Lin, Guanfeng",Anal Chem,281,26

The recent emergence of this new pathogen, the careful tracing of its transmission patterns, and the ability to propagate in culture allows the exploration of the mutational dynamics of the SARS-CoV in human populations. METHODS: We sequenced complete SARS-CoV genomes taken from primary human tissues (SIN3408, SIN3725V, SIN3765V), cultured isolates (SIN848, SIN846, SIN842, SIN845, SIN847, SIN849, SIN850, SIN852, SIN3408L), and five consecutive Vero cell passages (SIN2774_P1, SIN2774_P2, SIN2774_P3, SIN2774_P4, SIN2774_P5) arising from SIN2774 isolate. These represented individual patient samples, serial in vitro passages in cell culture, and paired human and cell culture isolates. Employing a refined mutation filtering scheme and constant mutation rate model, the mutation rates were estimated and the possible date of emergence was calculated. Phylogenetic analysis was used to uncover molecular relationships between the isolates. RESULTS: Close examination of whole genome sequence of 54 SARS-CoV isolates identified before 14(th )October 2003, including 22 from patients in Singapore, revealed the mutations engendered during human-to-Vero and Vero-to-human transmission as well as in multiple Vero cell passages in order to refine our analysis of human-to-human transmission. Though co-infection by different quasipecies in individual tissue samples is observed, the in vitro mutation rate of the SARS-CoV in Vero cell passage is negligible. The in vivo mutation rate, however, is consistent with estimates of other RNA viruses at approximately 5.7 × 10(-6 )nucleotide substitutions per site per day (0.17 mutations per genome per day), or two mutations per human passage (adjusted R-square = 0.4014). Using the immediate Hotel M contact isolates as roots, we observed that the SARS epidemic has generated four major genetic groups that are geographically associated: two Singapore isolates, one Taiwan isolate, and one North China isolate which appears most closely related to the putative SARS-CoV isolated from a palm civet. Non-synonymous mutations are centered in non-essential ORFs especially in structural and antigenic genes such as the S and M proteins, but these mutations did not distinguish the geographical groupings. However, no non-synonymous mutations were found in the 3CLpro and the polymerase genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the SARS-CoV is well adapted to growth in culture and did not appear to undergo specific selection in human populations. We further assessed that the putative origin of the SARS epidemic was in late October 2002 which is consistent with a recent estimate using cases from China. The greater sequence divergence in the structural and antigenic proteins and consistent deletions in the 3' – most portion of the viral genome suggest that certain selection pressures are interacting with the functional nature of these validated and putative ORFs.","Vega, Vinsensius B; Ruan, Yijun; Liu, Jianjun; Lee, Wah Heng; Wei, Chia Lin; Se-Thoe, Su Yun; Tang, Kin Fai; Zhang, Tao; Kolatkar, Prasanna R; Ooi, Eng Eong; Ling, Ai Ee; Stanton, Lawrence W; Long, Philip M; Liu, Edison T",BMC Infect Dis,281,24

Our aim was to establish the clinical, laboratory, and radiological manifestations of respiratory viral infections in SCA at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital (SQUH), Oman and assess its impact on disease morbidity and mortality, with special emphasis on H1N1. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective study in SCA patients with respiratory viral infections following up at the hematology department at SQUH. We collected demographic data and clinical, radiological, and laboratory parameters. RESULTS: In 84 SCA patients with 109 admission episodes for vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), molecular diagnostic techniques confirmed 125 respiratory viral infections. Rhinovirus was the most prevalent infection (35.8%), whereas H1N1 virus infection was seen only in 10.1%. Laboratory investigations revealed a significant fall in mean hemoglobin levels, mean white blood cell, and platelet counts from baseline, whereas there was a significant rise in the mean lymphocyte and retic count, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein levels during infective episodes (p < 0.050, Wilcoxon signed rank test). One-third (32.1%) of the VOC episodes progressed to acute chest syndrome (ACS), but in the H1N1 cohort, only two episodes of ACS was seen (18.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Rhinovirus was the commonest respiratory virus infections in SCA patients, whereas parainfluenza 3 was associated with a significant adverse outcome. H1N1 was associated with a mild course.

Antibodies against nucleocapsid protein (anti-NCP) was detected only in the saliva samples of COVID-19 patients and not in vaccinated samples, allowing facile differentiation of vaccination from infection. SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1 IgG antibody in saliva measured by nLF demonstrated similar evolution trends post vaccination to that in matching dried blood spot (DBS) samples measured by a quantitative pGOLD lab-test, enabling the nLF to be a valid tool for non-invasive personalized monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 antibody persistence.

Most of these studies report high accuracy when classifying COVID-19 patients from normal or other commonly occurring pneumonia cases. However, these results are often obtained on cross-validation studies without an independent test set coming from a separate dataset and have biases such as the two classes to be predicted come from two completely different datasets. In this work, we investigate potential overfitting and biases in such studies by designing different experimental setups within the available public data constraints and highlight the challenges and limitations of developing deep learning models with such datasets. We propose a deep learning architecture for COVID-19 classification that combines two very popular classification networks, ResNet and Xception, and use it to carry out the experiments to investigate challenges and limitations. The results show that the deep learning models can overestimate their performance due to biases in the experimental design and overfitting to the training dataset. We compare the proposed architecture to state-of-the-art methods utilizing an independent test set for evaluation, where some of the identified bias and overfitting issues are reduced. Although our proposed deep learning architecture gives the best performance with our best possible setup, we highlight the challenges in comparing and interpreting various deep learning algorithms' results. While the deep learning-based methods using chest imaging data show promise in being helpful for clinical management and triage of COVID-19 patients, our experiments suggest that a larger, more comprehensive database with less bias is necessary for developing tools applicable in real clinical settings.","Hasan, M.

A well-established first-line defense on oropharyngeal microbiome could be a promising strategy to protect individuals from respiratory tract infections including COVID-19. The most thoroughly studied oropharyngeal probiotic product which creates a stable upper respiratory tract microbiota capable of preventing upper respiratory tract infections was chosen to evaluate the safety and efficacy on reducing episodes of upper respiratory tract infections for COVID-19 healthcare workers. To our knowledge to date, this is the very first study describing the beneficial effects of oropharyngeal probiotic been administered by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this randomized controlled trial, we provided the probiotics to frontline medical staff who work in the hospitals in Wuhan and had been in close contact with hospitalized COVID-19 patients for prophylactic use on a daily basis. Our finding suggests that oropharyngeal probiotic administration significantly reduced the incidence of respiratory tract infections by 64.8%, reduced the time experiencing respiratory tract infections and oral ulcer symptoms by 78%, shortened the days absent from work by 95.5%, and reduced the time under medication where there is no record of antibiotic and anti-viral drug intake in the probiotic group. Furthermore, medical staff treated with Bactoblis experienced sustained protection from respiratory tract infections since the 10th day of oropharyngeal probiotic administration resulting in an extremely low incidence rate of respiratory tract infections.","Wang, Qiang; Lin, Xuan; Xiang, Xiaochen; Liu, Wanxin; Fang, Ying; Chen, Haiping; Tang, Fang; Guo, Hongyan; Chen, Di; Hu, Xiafen; Wu, Qingming; Zhu, Baoli; Xia, Junbo",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,281,5

A recent Australian adolescent population survey provided a unique opportunity to derive preference-based HRQoL. METHODS: Data from 2967 adolescents aged 11–17 years were analysed. An interviewer-led parent/carer questionnaire was administered for demographic variables and mental disorders of adolescents during previous 12 months using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children. A self-report survey was administered to derive HRQoL using the child health utility nine-dimensions instrument (CHU-9D). Weighted HRQoL was derived for several demographic groups, mental disorder diagnosis, and youth risk behaviours. RESULTS: The total population had a mean utility of 0.78 [standard deviation (SD): 0.20]. Males had a significantly higher mean utility (0.81, SD 0.18) than females (0.76, SD: 0.21) (Cohen’s d = 0.23, p < 0.001), and utility decreased with age for both males and females (p < 0.001). Family type and some parent/carer variables were associated with significant lower HRQoL scores with small effect size. Youth risk behaviours were associated with reduced HRQoL with moderate effect sizes. Adolescents who self-harmed, had suicidal ideation, or had a mental disorder had significantly lower utilities scores with moderate to large effect sizes compared to those who did not have such conditions. CONCLUSIONS: This study has provided contemporary Australian population norms for HRQoL in adolescents that may be used as cross comparison between studies as well as indicators allowing estimation of population health (e.g. estimation of the burden of disease) and can be used to populate future economic models.","Le, Long Khanh-Dao; Richards-Jones, Scott; Chatterton, Mary Lou; Engel, Lidia; Lawrence, David; Stevenson, Chris; Pepin, Genevieve; Ratcliffe, Julie; Sawyer, Michael; Mihalopoulos, Cathrine",Qual Life Res,281,16

Poor responses to viral insults may lead to chronic or overwhelming infection, whereas unrestrained activation can cause autoimmune diseases and cancer. Control over the magnitude and duration of the antiviral immune response is exerted by a finely tuned positive or negative regulation at the DNA, RNA, and protein level of members of the type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathways and on the expression and activity of antiviral and proinflammatory factors. As summarized in this review, committed research during the last decade has shown that several of these processes are exquisitely regulated by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), transcripts with poor coding capacity, but highly versatile functions. After infection, viruses, and the antiviral response they trigger, deregulate the expression of a subset of specific lncRNAs that function to promote or repress viral replication by inactivating or potentiating the antiviral response, respectively. These IFN-related lncRNAs are also highly tissue- and cell-type-specific, rendering them as promising biomarkers or therapeutic candidates to modulate specific stages of the antiviral immune response with fewer adverse effects.","Suarez, Beatriz; Prats-Mari, Laura; Unfried, Juan P.; Fortes, Puri",Int J Mol Sci,281,28

Many trials have small sample sizes, so estimates of treatment effects are imprecise. Hence, clinicians may find it difficult to decide when to treat patients with experimental drugs. A conventional practice when comparing standard care and an innovation is to choose the innovation only if the estimated treatment effect is positive and statistically significant. This practice defers to standard care as the status quo. We study treatment choice from the perspective of statistical decision theory, which considers treatment options symmetrically when assessing trial findings. METHODS: We use the concept of near-optimality to evaluate criteria for treatment choice. This concept jointly considers the probability and magnitude of decision errors. An appealing criterion from this perspective is the empirical success rule, which chooses the treatment with the highest observed average patient outcome in the trial. RESULTS: Considering the design of some COVID-19 trials, we show that the empirical success rule yields treatment choices that are much closer to optimal than those generated by prevailing decision criteria based on hypothesis tests. CONCLUSION: Using trial findings to make near-optimal treatment choices rather than perform hypothesis tests should improve clinical decision making.","Manski, Charles F.; Tetenov, Aleksey",Value Health,281,26

We describe formation and operation of a COVID‐19 multidisciplinary consultation service that was allowed to individualize treatment for critically ill patients with COVID‐19 during the pandemic. METHODS: Institutional experts from different subspecialties formed a COVID‐19 CSS task force at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY. They agreed on a set of four clinical and six laboratory parameters that can help early identify COVID‐19 CSS. We describe the formation and implementation of the COVID‐19 task force. The case series description of the COVID‐19 CSS consultation cohort highlights consultation volume, baseline characteristics, clinical and laboratory parameters, and how biologic treatments were allocated to these patients. RESULTS: Between April 4,2020, and May 7,2020, the COVID‐19 CSS task force was formed, consisting of adult and pediatric rheumatologists and allergy and immunology physicians. The task force evaluated a total of 288 patients, of whom 197 (68%) were male, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 62 (51‐70) years, 122 (42%) were Hispanic, and 88 (31%) were Black or African American. The common presenting symptoms in all referred patients were dyspnea (85%) and diarrhea (80%). Thirty‐one patients who received biologic therapy were younger, with a median (IQR) age of 53 (32‐63) years, as opposed to 62.5 (52‐70) years in the nonbiologic group (P = 0.008).

During the 2015 outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Korea, healthcare workers came in contact with patients with MERS were quarantined either at home or in a hospital ward. In this study, we aimed to compare the psychiatric symptoms of these employees according to the method of quarantine. Methods: All 146 quarantined staff completed self-report questionnaires. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, anxiety symptoms were assessed using Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and acute stress disorder (ASD) symptoms were evaluated using the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire. Results: The in-hospital quarantine group had a higher rate of symptoms of depression (p < 0.001) and ASD (p = 0.014) than the group quarantined at home. Logistic regression analysis showed that respondents quarantined in the hospital (OR = 6.342; 95% CI 1.853–21.708) and those quarantined for longer periods (OR = 1.153, 95% CI = 1.036–1.285) had a higher risk of depressive symptoms. Conclusions: In-hospital quarantine and quarantine for longer periods increase the risk of depressive symptoms. When quarantine measures are taken, certain measures are needed to minimize the risk of psychiatric problems. Appropriate interventions should be implemented if psychiatric problems occur.","Seong, Su Jeong; Kim, Hyung Joon; Yim, Kyung Mi; Park, Ji Won; Son, Kyung Hoon; Jeon, Yeong Ju; Hwang, Jae Yeon",Front Psychiatry,281,0

Cancer and anti-cancer therapies are well-known additional risk factors for VTE. Nonetheless, the VTE risk in patients with both cancer and COVID-19 infection remains unknown as recent studies have not found an association due to sample size limitations. We report the incidence of and risk factors for VTE and PE among hospitalized patients with cancer and COVID-19. Methods: The COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) developed an international retrospective cohort study (NCT04354701) to investigate the clinical course and complications of COVID-19 among adult patients with an active or previous history of cancer. For the current study, cumulative incidences of clinically detected VTE and PE were analyzed among hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Pre-specified subgroup analysis was performed to examine the interaction between intensive care unit (ICU) admission and recent anti-cancer therapy on VTE outcomes. Bivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between baseline variables and VTE; unadjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were reported. These variables included age, sex, obesity (BMI>30), race/ethnicity, performance status, comorbidities, blood type, history of VTE, recent surgery, recent anti-cancer therapy, cancer subtype VTE risk grouping (adapted from Khorana Score), pre-admission anticoagulant or antiplatelet use, and ICU admission status. Results: From March 17, 2020 to July 31, 2020, 3914 patients were enrolled in the CCC19 registry. For the present analysis, patients were excluded if they had inadequate follow-up <4 weeks (n=950), were not admitted to the hospital (n=1008), or had unknown VTE outcomes (n=327). Among the 1629 hospitalized patients, the median follow-up was 35 days. Patients were comprised from 3 countries (92% US, 6% Canada, 2% Spain), with a median age of 70, 45% female, and a median comorbidity score of 3. Racial/ethnic breakdown included 44% White, 26% Black, 14% Hispanic, and 13% Other. A past history of VTE was reported in 9% of patients; pre-admission anticoagulant use and antiplatelet use were reported in 25% and 35% of patients, respectively. The most common cancer types included prostate (18%), breast (15%), and lymphoma (14%). Based on the VTE risk grouping adapted from the original Khorana Score, 34% were low-risk, 29% were high-risk, and 6% were very high-risk. The receipt of anti-cancer therapy within 3 months of diagnosis was observed in 39% of patients (17% cytotoxic chemotherapy, 11% targeted therapy, 7% endocrine therapy, and 5% immunotherapy). The overall incidence of inhospital VTE and PE was 9.3% and 5.2%, respectively. The corresponding estimates were 13.4% and 7.9% among the ICU subgroup. On bivariable analysis, significant predictors of VTE included ICU admission, recent anti-cancer therapy, active cancer status, cancer subtype VTE risk grouping, and pre-admission antiplatelet use (Table 1). Pre-admission anticoagulant use had significant associations with PE but not VTE. Multivariable adjustment is ongoing to identify independent risk factor for VTE and clarify the impact of pre-admission anticoagulant/antiplatelet use controlled for other potential confounders. Both ICU admission status and anti-cancer therapy increased the risk of VTE independently. Non-ICU patients not on anti-cancer therapy had the lowest incidence of VTE (4.5%), whose estimate was similar to that reported in the non-cancer hospitalized population with COVID-19 infection. Patients with either ICU admission or recent anti-cancer therapy had the intermediate risk (11.0%), whereas ICU patients with recent anti-cancer therapy had the highest risk (16.7%). We did not observe confounding or effect modification by the ICU subgroup on the association between anti-cancer therapy and VTE. Conclusion: In this cohort study of hospitalized patients with cancer and COVID-19, recent anti-cancer therapy, active disease, high-risk VTE cancer subtypes, and ICU admission have increased risk of VTE and PE, while pre-admission anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy may reduce the risk. This information will aid in developing a risk prediction tool for VTE in hospitalized patients with cancer and COVID-19.

To manage the serviceable inventory, we implement a proportional order-up-to (POUT) replenishment policy. In this context, we first analyse the system efficiency by assessing its capacity to meet customer demand in a cost-effective manner. To this end, we consider both inventory performance (i.e., the balance between inventory holding and stock-out costs) and production smoothness (by measuring the Bullwhip effect in the supply chain). Second, we investigate the system resilience to demand volatility. In particular, we explore the impact of demand shocks on the inventory and production of the closed-loop system. Interestingly, we find that tuning the POUT controller to optimise efficiency may be problematic in terms of resilience to demand shocks. In this sense, a key trade-off exists that needs to be carefully considered by supply chain managers. Linking efficiency to resilience in such supply chains thus becomes essential to strengthen the transition towards more circular economic models. All in all, our analysis, via control-theoretic and simulation techniques, provides professionals with valuable insights into how to identify the appropriate ‘formula’ for building both efficient and resilient closed-loop supply chains.","de Arquer, María; Ponte, Borja; Pino, Raúl",Cent Eur J Oper Res,281,1

Many inpatients with COVID-19 have shown clinical symptoms related to sepsis, which will aggravate the deterioration of patients’ condition. We aim to diagnose Viral Sepsis Caused by SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing laboratory test data of patients with COVID-19 and establish an early predictive model for sepsis risk among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This study retrospectively investigated laboratory test data of 2,453 patients with COVID-19 from electronic health records. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) was employed to build four models with different feature subsets of a total of 69 collected indicators. Meanwhile, the explainable Shapley Additive ePlanation (SHAP) method was adopted to interpret predictive results and to analyze the feature importance of risk factors. FINDINGS: The model for classifying COVID-19 viral sepsis with seven coagulation function indicators achieved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.9213 (95% CI, 89.94–94.31%), sensitivity 97.17% (95% CI, 94.97–98.46%), and specificity 82.05% (95% CI, 77.24–86.06%). The model for identifying COVID-19 coagulation disorders with eight features provided an average of 3.68 (±) 4.60 days in advance for early warning prediction with 0.9298 AUC (95% CI, 86.91–99.04%), 82.22% sensitivity (95% CI, 67.41–91.49%), and 84.00% specificity (95% CI, 63.08–94.75%). INTERPRETATION: We found that an abnormality of the coagulation function was related to the occurrence of sepsis and the other routine laboratory test represented by inflammatory factors had a moderate predictive value on coagulopathy, which indicated that early warning of sepsis in COVID-19 patients could be achieved by our established model to improve the patient’s prognosis and to reduce mortality.","Tang, Guoxing; Luo, Ying; Lu, Feng; Li, Wei; Liu, Xiongcheng; Nan, Yucen; Ren, Yufei; Liao, Xiaofei; Wu, Song; Jin, Hai; Zomaya, Albert Y.; Sun, Ziyong",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,281,18

To date, single cell and high-throughput systems based analyses of the peripheral and pulmonary immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 suggest that a hyperactive and dysregulated immune response underpins the development of severe disease, with a prominent role assigned to neutrophils. Characterised in part by robust generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), the presence of immature, immunosuppressive and activated neutrophil subsets in the circulation, and neutrophilic infiltrates in the lung, a granulocytic signature is emerging as a defining feature of severe COVID-19. Furthermore, an assessment of the number, maturity status and/or function of circulating neutrophils at the time of hospital admission has shown promise as a prognostic tool for the early identification of patients at risk of clinical deterioration. Here, by summarising the results of studies that have examined the peripheral and pulmonary immune response to SARS-CoV-2, we provide a comprehensive overview of the changes that occur in the composition, phenotype and function of the neutrophil pool in COVID-19 patients of differing disease severities and discuss potential mediators of SARS-CoV-2-induced neutrophil dysfunction. With few specific treatments currently approved for COVID-19, we conclude the review by discussing whether neutrophils represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19.","Hazeldine, Jon; Lord, Janet M.",Front Immunol,281,22

Polymorphisms at OAS1 have been shown to correlate with differential susceptibility to several infections of great public health significance, including hepatitis C virus, SARS coronavirus, and West Nile virus. Population genetics analyses in hominoids have revealed interesting evolutionary patterns. In Central African chimpanzee, OAS1 has evolved under long-term balancing selection, resulting in the persistence of polymorphisms since the origin of hominoids, whereas human populations have acquired and retained OAS1 alleles from Neanderthal and Denisovan origin. We decided to further investigate the evolution of OAS1 in primates by characterizing intra-specific variation in four species commonly used as models in infectious disease research: the rhesus macaque, the cynomolgus macaque, the olive baboon, and the Guinea baboon. In baboons, OAS1 harbors a very low level of variation. In contrast, OAS1 in macaques exhibits a level of polymorphism far greater than the genomic average, which is consistent with the action of balancing selection. The region of the enzyme that directly interacts with viral RNA, the RNA-binding domain, contains a number of polymorphisms likely to affect the RNA-binding affinity of OAS1. This strongly suggests that pathogen-driven balancing selection acting on the RNA-binding domain of OAS1 is maintaining variation at this locus. Interestingly, we found that a number of polymorphisms involved in RNA-binding were shared between macaques and chimpanzees. This represents an unusual case of convergent polymorphism.","Fish, Ian; Boissinot, Stéphane",Immunogenetics,281,10

Howerver, multiple gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms have been reported in Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19). We conducted a retrospective cohort study of inpatients with COVID-19 at the George Washington University Hospital (GWUH) to assess the prevalence of GI symptoms and their association with clinical outcomes. METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 401 adults admitted to GWUH with positive SARS-CoV-2 tests from February 24 to May 21, 2020, ultimately including 382 inpatients. RESULTS: 87% of our cohort was African American or Latinx. 59% of patients reported at least one GI symptom, with diarrhea being the most common (29%). Patients with GI symptoms were slightly younger (58 +/- 15.8 vs. 65 +/- 16.9, p = 0.0005), have higher body mass index (31.5 +/- Standard Deviation of 8.7 vs. 28 +/- 8.2, p = 0.0001), and more likely to be Latinx (34 vs. 27, p = 0.01). Patients who presented with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea had significantly lower rates of death during hospitalization compared to those who did not present those symptoms (Odds Ratio 0.48, 95% Confidence Interval 0.28–0.8, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that GI symptoms portend a less-severe clinical course of COVID-19 which may reflect a different disease phenotype and lower overall immune response.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between October 2009 and June 2010, 73 patients with early breast cancer (T1-3N0-1M0) who underwent breast conserving surgery were enrolled into the study. Thirty-six of these participants received 50 Gy of conventional irradiation in 25 fractions over 5 weeks to the whole breast with a sequential boost to the tumor bed with 10–16 Gy in 5–8 fractions (Conv-SEQ). The other 37 participants received a hypofractionated dose of 43.2 Gy in 16 fractions with an additional daily concomitant boost (CB) of 0.6 Gy over 3 weeks (Hypo-CB). RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 123 months, ipsilateral local recurrence (ILR) was found in 3 participants, 1 of whom was in the hypofractionated group. All 3 ILR were true local recurrence (TR). There were no significant differences in the 10-year disease free survival (DFS) and 10-year overall survival rates (OS) between the conventional and hypofractionated groups (93.9% vs. 94.4%, p = 0.96 and 91.9% vs. 91.6%, p = 0.792, respectively).

Conventional testing methods such as the antigen test, serology tests, and polymerase chain reaction tests are widely used. However, the test results can take anything from a few hours to a few days to reach the patient. Chest CT scan images have been used as alternatives for the detection of COVID-19 infection. Use of CT scan images alone might have limited capabilities, which calls attention to incorporating clinical features. In this paper, deep learning algorithms have been utilized to integrate the chest CT scan images obtained from patients with their clinical characteristics for fast and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. The framework uses an ANN to obtain the probability of the patient being infected with COVID-19 using their clinical information. Beyond a certain threshold, the chest CT scan of the patient is classified using a deep learning model which has been trained to classify the CT scan with 99% accuracy.","Mishra, Shreyas",SN Comput Sci,281,12

These viruses have been studied exclusively by PCR in stool and detected only in patients with diarrhoea, although at low prevalence. Three genotypes of BuV have been identified. We detected, by in-house EIA, BuV1-3 IgG antibodies in 7/228 children (3.1%) and 10/180 adults (5.6%), whereas TuV IgG was found in one child (0.4%). All children and 91% of the adults were Finnish, yet interestingly 3/6 adults of Indian origin were BuV-IgG positive. By competition EIA, no cross-reactivity between the BuVs was detected, indicating that the BuV genotypes represent distinct serotypes. Furthermore, we analysed by BuV qPCR stool and nasal swab samples from 955 children with gastroenteritis, respiratory illness, or both, and found BuV DNA in three stools (0.3%) and for the first time in a nasal swab (0.1%). This is the first study documenting the presence of BuV and TuV antibodies in humans. Although the seroprevalences of both viruses were low in Finland, our results indicate that BuV infections might be widespread in Asia. The BuV-specific humoral immune responses appeared to be strong and long-lasting, pointing to systemic infection in humans.","Väisänen, Elina; Paloniemi, Minna; Kuisma, Inka; Lithovius, Väinö; Kumar, Arun; Franssila, Rauli; Ahmed, Kamruddin; Delwart, Eric; Vesikari, Timo; Hedman, Klaus; Söderlund-Venermo, Maria",Sci Rep,281,16

Airborne precaution personal protective equipment and preventative measures are universally mandated for medical procedures deemed to be aerosol generating. The implementation of these measures is having a huge impact on healthcare provision. There is currently a lack of quantitative evidence on the number and size of airborne particles produced during aerosol‐generating procedures to inform risk assessments. To address this evidence gap, we conducted real‐time, high‐resolution environmental monitoring in ultraclean ventilation operating theatres during tracheal intubation and extubation sequences. Continuous sampling with an optical particle sizer allowed characterisation of aerosol generation within the zone between the patient and anaesthetist. Aerosol monitoring showed a very low background particle count (0.4 particles.l(−1)) allowing resolution of transient increases in airborne particles associated with airway management. As a positive reference control, we quantitated the aerosol produced in the same setting by a volitional cough (average concentration, 732 (418) particles.l(−1), n = 38). Tracheal intubation including facemask ventilation produced very low quantities of aerosolised particles (average concentration, 1.4 (1.4) particles.l(−1), n = 14, p < 0.0001 vs. cough). Tracheal extubation, particularly when the patient coughed, produced a detectable aerosol (21 (18) l(−1), n = 10) which was 15‐fold greater than intubation (p = 0.0004) but 35‐fold less than a volitional cough (p < 0.0001). The study does not support the designation of elective tracheal intubation as an aerosol‐generating procedure. Extubation generates more detectable aerosol than intubation but falls below the current criterion for designation as a high‐risk aerosol‐generating procedure. These novel findings from real‐time aerosol detection in a routine healthcare setting provide a quantitative methodology for risk assessment that can be extended to other airway management techniques and clinical settings. They also indicate the need for reappraisal of what constitutes an aerosol‐generating procedure and the associated precautions for routine anaesthetic airway management.","Brown, J.; Gregson, F. K.

More than 40,000 CAM cases have been reported in India. The emergence of CAM cases in India has been attributed to environmental, host, and iatrogenic factors. Mucorales spore burden has been reported globally; however, their presence is higher in tropical countries such as India, contributing to the emergence of CAM. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with diabetes mellitus, haematological malignancies, solid organ transplants, corticosteroid therapy and neutropenia were more prone to mucormycosis, whereas in COVID-19 patients, virus-induced endothelial dysfunction, hyperglycaemia, and immune dysfunction following corticosteroid use increase the risk of acquiring mucormycosis. The interaction of Mucorales spores with the epithelial cells, followed by endothelial invasion, is a crucial step in the pathogenesis of mucormycosis. Endothelial damage and increased endothelial receptor expression induced by COVID-19 infection may predispose patients to CAM. COVID-19 infection may directly induce hyperglycaemia by damaging beta cells of the pancreas or by corticosteroid therapy, which may contribute to CAM pathogenesis. Iron acquisition from the host, especially in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or deferoxamine therapy, is an important virulence trait of Mucorales. Similarly, the hyperferritinaemia caused by COVID-19 may act as a source of iron for Mucorales growth and invasion. In addition, corticosteroid treatment reduces or abolishes the innate immune functions of phagocytic cells contributing to the pathogenesis of CAM. This review aims to discuss primarily the host and iatrogenic factors shared between COVID-19 and mucormycosis that could explain the emergence of CAM.","Prakash, Hariprasath; Skiada, Anna; Paul, Raees Ahmad; Chakrabarti, Arunaloke; Rudramurthy, Shivaprakash Mandya",J Fungi (Basel),281,14

Our objectives were to estimate the relative contribution of HMPV to hospitalization in children with acute respiratory infection, to define the clinical and epidemiological features of HMPV single and multiple infections, and to compare HMPV infections with respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), rhinovirus (HRV), adenovirus and human bocavirus infections in the same population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective study performed on all children less than 14 years of age with a respiratory tract disease admitted to a secondary hospital between September 2005- June 2014. Clinical characteristics of patients were analyzed. Nasopharyngeal aspirate was taken at admission for viral study with polymerase chain reaction for 16 respiratory viruses. A total of 3,906 children were included. At least one respiratory virus was detected in 75.2% of them. The most common identified virus was HRSV, followed by HRV. HMPV was detected in 214 cases (5.5%); 133 (62%) were single infections and the remaining were detected in coinfection with other viruses. 90.7% cases were detected between February and May. Children’s mean age was 13.83 ± 18 months. Fever was frequent (69%), and bronchiolitis (27%), and recurrent wheezing (63%) were the main clinical diagnosis. Hypoxia was present in 65% of the patients and 47% of them had an infiltrate in X-ray. Only 6 (2.8%) children were admitted to the intensive care unit. Only the duration of the hospitalization was different, being longer in the coinfections group (p <0.05). There were many differences in seasonality and clinical characteristics between HMPV and other respiratory viruses being more similar to HRSV. CONCLUSIONS: HMPV infections accounted for 5.5% of total viral infections in hospitalized children. The clinical characteristics were similar to HRSV infections, but seasonality and clinical data were different from other viral infections.","García-García, María Luz; Calvo, Cristina; Rey, Cristina; Díaz, Beatriz; Molinero, Maria del Mar; Pozo, Francisco; Casas, Inmaculada",PLoS One,281,16

We review important aspects of CT in COVID-19 infection from the justification of its use to specific scan protocols for optimizing radiation dose and diagnostic information. Key Points • Chest CT provides useful information in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. • When indicated, chest CT in most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia must be performed with non-contrast, low-dose protocol. • Although chest CT has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, CT findings are non-specific and overlap with other viral infections including influenza and H1N1.","Kalra, Mannudeep K.; Homayounieh, Fatemeh; Arru, Chiara; Holmberg, Ola; Vassileva, Jenia",Eur Radiol,281,21

RESULTS: Our analyses uncover 21 differentially expressed lncRNAs broadly involved in cell survival and regulation of gene expression. These lncRNAs can directly interact with six differentially expressed protein-coding genes, and ten host genes that interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Also, they can block the suppressive effect of nine microRNAs induced in viral infections. CONCLUSION: Our investigation determines that deregulated lncRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 infection are involved in viral proliferation, cellular survival, and immune response, ultimately determining disease outcome.","Turjya, Rafeed Rahman; Khan, Md.

As a result, we found nativity and race/ethnicity were associated with flu vaccination rates; foreign-born and non-Hispanic black respondents were less likely to take the vaccine than U.S.-born and non-Hispanic white respondents. The odds ratios were largest for the elderly, those working in the healthcare industry, those with health insurance, and those with a usual source of care (ORs = 3.058, 2.871, 2.317, and 2.342, respectively), suggesting that access to healthcare resources is critical for the uptake of the flu vaccine. There was a significant interaction effect between nativity and race/ethnicity.

Viruses are the main etiological agents, and their behavior tends to be seasonal and vary by geographical location. Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has recently been described as a cause of severe acute respiratory infection and its prevalence and clinical behavior in children at moderate altitudes is unknown. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out on patients seen at a university hospital in Bogotá, Colombia between October 2015 and December 2017 in a city at a moderate altitude above sea level. Children with acute respiratory infections who had had a multiplex RT-PCR assay were selected. The prevalence of HMPV infection, its clinical outcomes and its relationship to rainfall were evaluated. RESULTS: Out of a total of 14,760 discharged patients, multiplex RT-PCR was performed on 502 and a virus was detected in 420 children with acute respiratory infection (ARI). The study group had a median age of 21 months (IQR 7–60), with similar proportion of males and females (56.4 and 43.6% respectively) and 5.2% (CI 95 3.3–7.8%) prevalence of HMPV infection. The group with HMPV infection showed a greater frequency of viral coinfection (22.7% vs 14% P = 0.03) compared with ARI caused by other viruses. The rate of bacterial coinfection (P = 0.31), presence of comorbidities (p = 0.75), length of hospital stay (P = 0.42), need for mechanical ventilation (P = 0.75) and mortality (P = 0.22) were similar for HMPV and other viral infections. A moderate correlation was established between HMPV infection and rainfall peaks (Spearman’s Rho 0.44 p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Human metapneumovirus was the fifth most frequently isolated virus in children with ARI, had similar clinical behavior and severity to other viruses but a higher rate of viral coinfection. Its peaks seem to correlate to rainy seasons.","Evelyn, Obando; Jaime, Fernández-Sarmiento; David, Montoya; Lorena, Acevedo; Jenifer, Arroyave; Oscar, Gamboa",BMC Pediatr,281,1

Following rapid distribution and administration of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) under an Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (2), observational studies among nursing home residents demonstrated vaccine effectiveness (VE) ranging from 53% to 92% against SARS-CoV-2 infection (3-6). However, concerns about the potential for waning vaccine-induced immunity and the recent emergence of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant† highlight the need to continue to monitor VE (7). Weekly data reported by the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare (CMS)-certified skilled nursing facilities or nursing homes to CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN)§ were analyzed to evaluate effectiveness of full vaccination (2 doses received ≥14 days earlier) with any of the two currently authorized mRNA COVID-19 vaccines during the period soon after vaccine introduction and before the Delta variant was circulating (pre-Delta [March 1-May 9, 2021]), and when the Delta variant predominated¶ (Delta [June 21-August 1, 2021]). Using 17,407 weekly reports from 3,862 facilities from the pre-Delta period, adjusted effectiveness against infection for any mRNA vaccine was 74.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 70.0%-78.8%). Analysis using 33,160 weekly reports from 11,581 facilities during an intermediate period (May 10-June 20) found that the adjusted effectiveness was 67.5% (95% CI = 60.1%-73.5%). Analysis using 85,593 weekly reports from 14,917 facilities during the Delta period found that the adjusted effectiveness was 53.1% (95% CI = 49.1%-56.7%). Effectiveness estimates were similar for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. These findings indicate that mRNA vaccines provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection among nursing home residents; however, VE was lower after the Delta variant became the predominant circulating strain in the United States. This analysis assessed VE against any infection, without being able to distinguish between asymptomatic and symptomatic presentations. Additional evaluations are needed to understand protection against severe disease in nursing home residents over time. Because nursing home residents might remain at some risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection despite vaccination, multiple COVID-19 prevention strategies, including infection control, testing, and vaccination of nursing home staff members, residents, and visitors, are critical. An additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine might be considered for nursing home and long-term care facility residents to optimize a protective immune response.","Nanduri, Srinivas; Pilishvili, Tamara; Derado, Gordana; Soe, Minn Minn; Dollard, Philip; Wu, Hsiu; Li, Qunna; Bagchi, Suparna; Dubendris, Heather; Link-Gelles, Ruth; Jernigan, John A.; Budnitz, Daniel; Bell, Jeneita; Benin, Andrea; Shang, Nong; Edwards, Jonathan R.; Verani, Jennifer R.; Schrag, Stephanie J.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,281,3

Self-management emphasises the patient’s central role in managing their illness. This is pertinent given the majority of care is provided by the individual themselves; yet how individuals make sense of self-management in everyday life is largely unseen. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to capture the strengths and concerns of individuals with RA in self-managing their illness, raise awareness of their lived experience and spark a dialogue among stakeholders. METHODS: A community-based participatory approach, Photovoice, was adopted. A purposive sample of participants were tasked with taking photographs to represent the challenges and solutions to living with RA. Group workshops and semi-structured interviews were conducted to facilitate reflection, dialogue and analysis. Data analysis followed Braun and Clarke’s thematic analysis. Public exhibitions were held throughout the Autumn of 2019. RESULTS: Eight women and three men (n = 11) across suburban and urban regions of Ireland were recruited (mean age 57 years, disease duration 4–21 years). Participants identified four main themes which reflected the lived experience of self-managing RA: (i) I’m Here but I’m Not, (ii) Visible Illness, (iii) Medicine in All its Forms, (iv) Mind Yourself. These themes captured the challenge of reduced agency, limited contribution and participation, and a complex relationship between visible and invisible illness. Solutions focused on improving psychological and emotional resilience, particularly through personal reflection and increased agency. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that RA is experienced as a fluid relationship between states of masking and surfacing of illness shaped by contextual and situational factors. Photovoice was a highly effective tool to capture and communicate this complexity. Supporting increased agency among individuals with RA to control the (in)visibility of illness and disability can inform the development of future self-management support.","Donnelly, Susie; Wilson, Anthony G.; Mannan, Hasheem; Dix, Claire; Whitehill, Laura; Kroll, Thilo",PLoS One,281,24

These organisms are small obligately intracellular bacteria and are transmitted to humans by fleas. Murine typhus is endemic to coastal areas of the tropics and subtropics (especially port cities), where rats are the primary mammalian host and rat fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) are the vector. In the United States, a cycle of transmission involving opossums and cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) are the presumed reservoir and vector, respectively. The incidence and distribution of murine typhus appear to be increasing in endemic areas of the US. Rickettsia felis has also been reported throughout the world and is found within the ubiquitous cat flea. Flea-borne rickettsioses manifest as an undifferentiated febrile illness. Headache, malaise, and myalgia are frequent symptoms that accompany fever. The incidence of rash is variable, so its absence should not dissuade the clinician to consider a rickettsial illness as part of the differential diagnosis. When present, the rash is usually macular or papular. Although not a feature of murine typhus, eschar has been found in 12% of those with flea-borne spotted fever. Confirmatory laboratory diagnosis is usually obtained by serology; the indirect immunofluorescence assay is the serologic test of choice. Antibodies are seldom present during the first few days of illness. Thus, the diagnosis requires acute- and convalescent-phase specimens to document seroconversion or a four-fold increase in antibody titer. Since laboratory diagnosis is usually retrospective, when a flea-borne rickettsiosis is considered, empiric treatment should be initiated. The treatment of choice for both children and adults is doxycycline, which results in a swift and effective response. The following review is aimed to summarize the key clinical, epidemiological, ecological, diagnostic, and treatment aspects of flea-borne rickettsioses.","Caravedo Martinez, Maria A; Ramírez-Hernández, Alejandro; Blanton, Lucas S",Res Rep Trop Med,281,22

Setting: Emergency department and inpatient settings from 2 academic medical centers and 4 community hospitals. Participants: All individuals presenting to an emergency department and undergoing COVID-19 testing.

METHODS: We invited the submission of images collected about the pandemic between May and August 2020. We encouraged participants to yoke personal reflections or voice memos to their images. Using snowball sampling, we began with two invitations, including one to the graduates of a mentorship program continuously hosted since 2004 by the International Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions (IACAPAP). We analyzed de-identified images and anonymized transcripts through iterative coding using thematic analysis informed by rich picture analysis and aided by NVivo software. RESULTS: We collected submissions from child and adolescent mental health professionals (n = 134) working in 54 countries spread across the five continents. We identified four overarching domains with component themes that revealed both the commonality and the uniqueness of the pandemic experience around the globe: (1) Place (adjusting to emptiness and stillness; shifting timeframes; blending of spaces); (2) Person (disruption to life rhythms; emotional toll; positives of the pandemic); (3) Profession (changing practices; outreach efforts; guild pride—and guilt); and (4) Purpose (from pandemic to syndemic; from lamenting to embracing; planning toward a better tomorrow).

From January to March 2003, faeces from a convenient sample of 879 5- to 30-day-old goat kids from 60 herds were examined microscopically after staining with carbol fuschin. Oocyst shedding was scored semi-quantitatively (0 to 4+) allowing us to obtain a cumulative score per herd. Standardized questionnaires with information about management practices were collected in each farm. We found positive kids in 32 of 60 herds (53.3%) and in 142 animals out of 879 (16.2%). We used logistic regression for two risk-factor model: (1) simple positive (case: herd score ≥1+, at least one positive kid in the herd, versus control: herd score = 0), (2) strongly positive (case: overall herd score ≥3+ versus control: herd score <3+). Risk factors associated with simple positive herds were period of sampling compared to the peak of births (After versus Before, OR = 4.2, 95% CI 1.2, 15.3) and practice of kid grouping by age or weight (Yes versus No, OR = 4.4, 95% CI 1.0, 19.1). Risk factors associated with strongly positive herds were period of investigation (February/March versus January, OR = 12.7, 95% CI 2.1, 76.6), exposure to graminaceous plants in forage (OR = 11.6, 95% CI 1.7, 81.0) and type of ventilation in the goat premises (Vertical versus Wind effect, OR = 14.7, 95% CI 2.1, 106.1). No important association was found between kid-management practices and herd positivity. These results suggest a major role of the environment of kids during their first hours of life in the adult-goat premises regarding the transmission of C. parvum infection.","Delafosse, Arnaud; Castro-Hermida, José Antonio; Baudry, Christian; Ares-Mazás, Elvira; Chartier, Christophe",Prev Vet Med,281,28

Zhejiang, ranked fourth highest in COVID-19 incidence, is located in the Yangtze River Delta region of southeast China. This study was undertaken to identify the space-time characteristics of COVID-19 in Zhejiang. METHODS: Data on COVID-19 cases in Zhejiang Province from January to July 2020 were obtained from this network system. Individual information on cases and deaths was imported, and surveillance information, including demographic characteristics and geographic and temporal distributions, was computed by the system. The Knox test was used to identify possible space-time interactions to test whether cases that are close in distance were also close in time. Network analysis was performed to determine the relationship among the cases in a transmission community and to try to identify the key nodes. RESULTS: In total, 1475 COVID-19 cases and 1 fatal case were reported from January to July 2020 in Zhejiang Province, China. Most of the cases occurred before February 15(th), which accounted for 90.10%. The imported cases increased and became the main risk in Zhejiang Province after February 2020. The risk areas showed strong heterogeneity according to the Knox test. The areas at short distances within 1 kilometer and at brief periods within 5 days presented relatively high risk. The numbers of subcommunities for the four clusters were 12, 9, 6 and 4. There was obvious heterogeneity in the modularity of subcommunities. The maximum values of the node centrality for the four clusters were 2.9474, 4.3706, 4.1080 and 2.7500. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 was brought under control over a short period in Zhejiang Province. Imported infections from outside of mainland China then became a new challenge. The effects of spatiotemporal interaction exhibited interval heterogeneity. The characteristics of transmission showed short range and short term risks. The importance to the cluster of each case was detected, and the key patients were identified. It is suggested that we should focus on key patients in complex conditions and in situations with limited control resources.","Wu, Haocheng; Wu, Chen; Lu, Qinbao; Ding, Zheyuan; Xue, Ming; Lin, Junfen",PLoS One,281,11

Though the virus is considered as a novel entity, it is not a completely new member. It is just a new version of previously emerged human SARS corona virus. The rapid evolving nature by changing host body environment and extreme environmental stability, collectively makes SARS-CoV-2 into an extremely virulent genetic variant. The evolution of the virus has been occurred by the continuous process of molecular genetic manipulation, through mutation, deletion and genetic recombinationevents. Different host body environment acts as the supportive system for the pathogen which creates extreme selective pressure. By the process of genetic evolution the pathogen developes new characters. Then the new version of the virus has been naturally selected by susceptible human host and adapt itself inside the host body causing deadly effect. Moreover, extreme environmental stability helps in the process of viral survival outside the host and its transmission. Thus both the host body or internal environment and the external environment performs equally as a source, responsible for shaping the genetic evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 towards theCOVID-19 disease fitness in nature in a pandemic form.","Das, Piyanki; Choudhuri, Tathagata",Virusdisease,281,26

The results demonstrate that the 74 PRRSV strains belong to PRRSV-1, but the diversity among strains is high, based on nucleotide identity, individual ORF length and phylogenetic trees of individual ORFs. Furthermore, the data presented here show that the phylogenetic topology of some viruses is ORF dependent and suggests recombination. The identity of the strain of interest might be misinterpreted and wrong conclusions may be drawn in a diagnostic and epidemiological perspective, when only ORF5 is analyzed, as performed in many routine sequencing procedures.","Dortmans, J.

Recent studies showed people living with HIV (PLWH) are not at greater risk than the general population. Few studies have reviewed the impacts of COVID‐19 on PLWH. The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the impact of COVID‐19 on patients infected with HIV. METHODS: We executed a systematic search using four databases of PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science and screened the records in two steps based on their title/abstract and full text. This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) checklist to elevate the validity and reliability of its results. RESULTS: We reviewed 36 studies. The patients' age was above 20 years in all studies. In almost all studies, the inflammatory parameters were reported high. In most of the studies, all HIV patients completely recovered from the COVID 19 infection. Although CD4 count was not recorded in all studies, the minimum level was reported as 12 cells/µl. CONCLUSION: Based on the current review, we concluded that HIV patients at advanced stages (3 or 4) of the disease, whose CD4 counts are low, may show less severe COVID‐19 infection symptoms. Similarly, Interference can reduce the severity of immune reactions and subsequent cytokine storms and consequently mitigate the symptoms. Therefore, in most of the studies, the majority of HIV patients showed no severe symptoms and completely recovered from COVID 19 infection.","SeyedAlinaghi, SeyedAhmad; Karimi, Amirali; MohsseniPour, Mehrzad; Barzegary, Alireza; Mirghaderi, Seyed Peyman; Fakhfouri, Amirata; Saeidi, Solmaz; Razi, Armin; Mojdeganlou, Hengameh; Tantuoyir, Marcarious M.; Afsahi, Amir Masoud; Mehraeen, Esmaeil; Dadras, Omid",Immun Inflamm Dis,281,24

Through this work, we aim to answer the following questions: Can we automatically and accurately classify a news article as containing disinformation? What characteristics of disinformation differentiate it from other types of benign information? We conduct this study in the context of two significant events: the US elections of 2016 and the 2020 COVID pandemic. We build a series of classifiers to (i) examine linguistic clues exhibited by different types of fake news articles, (ii) analyze “clickbaityness” of disinformation headlines, and (iii) finally, perform fine-grained, veracity-based article classification through a natural language inference (NLI) module for automated disinformation verification; this utilizes a manually curated set of evidence sources. For the latter, we built a new dataset that is annotated with generic, veracity-based labels and ground truth evidence supporting each label. The veracity labels were formulated based on examining standards used by reputable fact-checking organizations. We show that disinformation derives features from both propaganda and mainstream news, making it more challenging to detect. However, there is significant potential for automating the fact-checking process to incorporate the degree of veracity. We provide error analysis that illustrates the challenges involved in the automated fact-checking task and identifies factors that may improve this process in future work. Finally, we also describe the implementation of a web app that extracts important entities and actions from a given article and searches the web to gather evidence from credible sources. The evidence articles are then used to generate a veracity label that can assist manual fact-checkers engaged in combating disinformation.","Pathak, Archita; Srihari, Rohini K.; Natu, Nihit",Comput Math Organ Theory,281,21

However, not all of which might prevent the virus from entering the cell, although their concentrations correlate with the titers of viral neutralization tests (NTs). Antibodies against the viral nucleocapsid (NC), e.g., can be classified as such. We aimed to prove the hypothesis that the apparent correlation between NC-antibody levels and NT-titers is mediated by simultaneously occurring antibodies against viral spike-protein components. Methods We included 64 individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection (>14d after symptom onset). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the NC (Roche total antibody ECLIA, Abbott IgG CMIA) and spike-protein (Technozym RBD ELISA, DiaSorin S1/S2 CLIA) were measured, and neutralization tests were performed. The effect of spike-protein antibodies on the correlation between NC-antibodies and NT-titers was evaluated by partial correlation and mediation analyses. Results Both tested assays assessing antibodies against the NC correlated significantly with NT titers: Abbott {rho}=0.742, P<0.0001; Roche {rho}=0.365, P<0.01. However, when controlling the rank correlations for the presence of RBD or S1/S2 antibodies, correlation coefficients dropped to {rho}=0.318/{rho}=0.329 (P<0.05/P<0.01) , respectively for Abbott and vanished for Roche. As a result, only a maximum of 11% of NT titer variability could be explained by NC-antibody levels. Conclusions Our data suggest that the apparent correlation between NC antibodies and NT titers is strongly mediated by co-occurring RBD antibody concentrations. To avoid falsely implied causal relationships, all correlation analyses of non-spike-associated antibody assays and neutralization assays should include a partial correlation analysis to exclude a possible mediator effect of spike-associated antibodies.","Perkmann, T.; Koller, T.; Perkmann-Nagele, N.; Klausberger, M.; Duerkop, M.; Holzer, B.; Hartmann, B.; Mucher, P.; Radakovics, A.; Ozsvar-Kozma, M.; Wagner, O.

The lower numbers of cases and deaths in Uganda might be due to pre-existing cross-immunity induced by zoonotic coronaviruses or circulating common cold human coronaviruses (HCoVs) before the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to test this premise, we compared IgA reactivity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and HCoVs in breast milk of US and rural Ugandan mothers collected in 2018 before the COVID-19 epidemic. Method: Ugandan and US pre-pandemic breast milk samples were run in duplicate on enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) to measure specific IgA antibody reactivity to the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2, human coronaviruses (HCoV) NL63, OC43, HKU1, and 229E. Pooled plasma from US COVID-19 positive and negative cases were employed as positive and negative controls, respectively. Results: One Ugandan pre-pandemic milk sample had remarkably high reactivity against all HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. There was higher IgA reactivity against the betacoronavirus HCoV-OC43 in Ugandan pre-pandemic milk samples by comparison with US pre-pandemic milk samples (p = 0.018). By contrast, there was significantly higher IgA reactivity against the alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 in US pre-pandemic milk samples by comparison with Ugandan pre-pandemic milk samples (p < 0.0001 and 0.035, respectively). Conclusion: Some Ugandan mothers may have robust pre-existing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 due to cross-immunity induced by HCoVs which may be passed on to their infants via breastfeeding. The differential pre-pandemic reactivity of US mothers to HCoV 229E and HCoV NL63 may have contributed to suboptimal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.","Egwang, T. G.; Owalla, T.

METHODS: Using methodology based on the Delphi technique, six experts in infectious and allergic disease were surveyed to allow for elicitation of group judgement and consensus view on issues pertinent to the aim. RESULTS: Key themes emerged where evidence shows that interaction with microbes that inhabit the natural environment and human microbiome plays an essential role in immune regulation. Changes in lifestyle and environmental exposure, rapid urbanisation, altered diet and antibiotic use have had profound effects on the human microbiome, leading to failure of immunotolerance and increased risk of allergic disease. Although evidence supports the concept of immune regulation driven by microbe–host interactions, the term ‘hygiene hypothesis’ is a misleading misnomer. There is no good evidence that hygiene, as the public understands, is responsible for the clinically relevant changes to microbial exposures. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests a combination of strategies, including natural childbirth, breast feeding, increased social exposure through sport, other outdoor activities, less time spent indoors, diet and appropriate antibiotic use, may help restore the microbiome and perhaps reduce risks of allergic disease. Preventive efforts must focus on early life. The term ‘hygiene hypothesis’ must be abandoned. Promotion of a risk assessment approach (targeted hygiene) provides a framework for maximising protection against pathogen exposure while allowing spread of essential microbes between family members. To build on these findings, we must change public, public health and professional perceptions about the microbiome and about hygiene. We need to restore public understanding of hygiene as a means to prevent infectious disease.","Bloomfield, Sally F; Rook, Graham AW; Scott, Elizabeth A; Shanahan, Fergus; Stanwell-Smith, Rosalind; Turner, Paul",Perspect Public Health,281,16

One category of CD101 variants is associated with a reduced capacity of regulatory T cells to suppress T cell cytokine production, resulting in a reduction in the baseline level of immune quiescence. These data are supported by transcriptomics data revealing alterations in the intrinsic regulation of antiviral pathways and HIV resistance genes in individuals with CD101 variants.

Data were collected on patient demographics, pattern of injury, complications, length of stay, and mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 132 patients were included. Of these, 34.8% (n = 46) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Bacterial pneumonia was observed at a significantly higher rate in those patients with COVID-19 (56.5% vs 15.1%; p =< 0.000). Non respiratory complications such as acute kidney injury (30.4% vs 9.3%; p =0.002) and urinary tract infection (10.9% vs 3.5%; p =0.126) were also more common in those patients with COVID-19. Length of stay was increased by a median of 21.5 days in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (p < 0.000). 30-day mortality was significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 (37.0%) when compared to those without (10.5%; p <0.000). CONCLUSION: This study has shown that patients with a neck of femur fracture have a high rate of mortality and complications such as bacterial pneumonia and acute kidney injury when diagnosed with COVID-19 within the perioperative period. We have demonstrated the high risk of in hospital transmission of COVID-19 and the association between the infection and an increased length of stay for the patients affected.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the status and change in electricity access, sources, and reliability at primary health centers (PHCs) in India; and to understand the effect of regular electricity supply on health services provision and on workforce availability and retention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from the lastest two rounds of district-level household survey (DLHS) in India, conducted in 2007–2008 and 2012–2013. RESULTS: Data of 8619 PHCs from DLHS-3 and 8540 PHCs from DLHS-4 were analyzed. The proportion of PHCs with access to electricity increased from 87% to 91%. However, regular electricity supply was available at only 50% of PHCs in 2012–2013, which was an increase from 36% such PHCs in 2007–2008. PHCs with regular electricity supply provided services to 50% more beneficiaries (deliveries and vaccination) than PHCs without regular or no electricity (P ≤ 0.001). Increased access to regular electricity was associated with improved availability and retention of health staff (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Government policies should aim to ensure access to regular electricity-supply-beyond just connection from grid-at all GPHCFs, including health sub-centers, PHCs, and community health centers. Indicators on electricity access at GPHCFs could be standardized and integrated into regular health and facility-related surveys as well as in the existing dashboards for real-time data collection. Health policy interventions should be informed by regular data collection and analysis. Improving access to regular electricity supply at GPHCFs can contribute to achieve the goals of National Health Policy of India. This will also help to advance universal health coverage in the country. There are lessons from this study, for other low and middle income countries, on improving health service provision at government health care facilities.","Mani, Sunil; Patnaik, Sasmita; Lahariya, Chandrakant",Indian J Community Med,281,25

Yet, despite the fast-growing body of literature on COVID transmission dynamics, current risk models either neglect contextual information on vaccination rates or disease prevalence or do not attempt to quantitatively model transmission. OBJECTIVE: This paper attempts to bridge this gap by providing informative risk metrics for live public events, along with a measure of their uncertainty. METHODS: Building upon existing models, our approach ties together three main components: (a) reliable modelling of the number of infectious cases at the time of the event, (b) evaluation of the efficiency of pre-event screening, and (c) modelling of the event's transmission dynamics and their uncertainty along using Monte Carlo simulations. RESULTS: We illustrate the application of our pipeline for a concert at the Royal Albert Hall and highlight the risk's dependency on factors such as prevalence, mask wearing, or event duration. We demonstrate how this event held on three different dates (August 20th 2020, January 20th 2021, and March 20th 2021) would likely lead to transmission events that are similar to community transmission rates (0.06 vs 0.07, 2.38 vs 2.39, and 0.67 vs 0.60, respectively). However, differences between event and background transmissions substantially widen in the upper tails of the distribution of number of infections (as denoted by their respective 99th quantiles: 1 vs 1, 19 vs 8, and 6 vs 3 for our three dates), further demonstrating that sole reliance on vaccination and antigen testing to gain entry would likely significantly underestimate the tail risk of the event. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the unknowns surrounding COVID-19 transmission, our estimation pipeline opens the discussion on contextualized risk assessment by combining the best tools at hand to assess the order of magnitude of the risk. Our model can be applied to any future event and is presented in a user-friendly R Shiny interface [88]. Finally, we discuss our model's limitations, as well as avenues for model evaluation and improvement.","Donnat, Claire; Bunbury, Freddy; Kreindler, Jack; Liu, David; Filippidis, Filippos T; El-Osta, Austen; Esko, Tonu; Harris, Matthew",JMIR public health and surveillance,281,1

Material and methods Participants were assessed in a cross-sectional online survey. Amongst others, sociodemographic data, sociosexual attitudes as well as engagement in a range of sexual activities and practices prior to and during the pandemic were collected. Additionally, for subjects in a relationship, sexual attraction to the partner (feelings of affection during partnered sexual activities, and physical sexual attraction) and relationship satisfaction were measured. Results Data of 1017 single and 1498 partnered participants were analyzed. Partnered participants masturbated significantly less during physical distancing measures compared to the period before, whereas single males masturbated more often. Single females masturbate less frequently but this difference was not statistically significant. For both subgroups, the frequency of most sexual activities significantly declined since the beginning of physical distancing measures with anal intercourse in partnered participants being the only exception that showed no significant decrease. In the group of participants in relationships, sociosexual variables and physical sexual attraction to one's partner showed a significant positive relationship to the number of new sexual practices added during physical distancing measures, while feelings of affection during partnered sexual activities and relationship satisfaction did not. Conclusion Our data support previous findings showing potential disruptive effects on sexual routines of single and partnered participants by the COVID-19 pandemic and physical distancing measures. Further studies are needed to reveal causal factors and to study long-term effects on mental health and relationships.","Hille, Z.; Oezdemir, U. C.; Beier, K. M.; Hatzler, L.",,281,1

As a preliminary attempt, we reveal a strongly positive zero‐order correlation between sentiments of tweets and COVID‐19 confirmed cases in U.S. Considering the unique hierarchical structure of the U.S. government, state governments exert their own power to issue public health policies. Indeed, there are different patterns of correlations between sentiments and COVID‐19 confirmed cases, affirming that country‐level characteristics suppress that of state‐level. Diving deeper into the textual content of COVID‐19 related tweets, there manifests a diverse set of topics which in turn lead to dispersed sentiments.

The main purpose of this study is to investigate the textural radiomics features on chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia patients and compare them with those of non-COVID pneumonia. This is a retrospective study. Some textural radiomics features were extracted from the CT images of 66 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and 40 with non-COVID pneumonia. For radiomics analysis, the regions of interest (ROIs) were manually identified inside the pulmonary ground-glass opacities. For each ROI, 12 textural features were obtained and, then, statistical analysis was performed to assess the differences in these features between the two study groups. RESULTS: 8 of the 12 texture features demonstrated a significant difference (P < 0.05) in two groups, with COVID-19 pneumonia lesions tending to be more heterogeneous in comparison with the non-COVID cases. Among the 8 significant features, only two (homogeneity and energy) were found to be higher in non-COVID cases. CONCLUSIONS: Textural radiomics features can be used for differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia from non-COVID pneumonia, as a non-invasive method, and help with better prognosis and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients.","Soleymani, Yunus; Jahanshahi, Amir Reza; Hefzi, Maryam; Fazel Ghaziani, Mona; Pourfarshid, Amin; Khezerloo, Davood",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,281,20

Using a fit-for-purpose SIQRM-compartment model for susceptible, infected, quarantined, recovered and mortalities on active cases, that we fitted from recorded data, a value of a statistical life year (VSLY) and an age-adjusted value of statistical life (A-VSL), we find that the economic costs of unmitigated suppression are multiples more than for early mandated suppression. We also find that using an equivalent VSLY welfare loss from fatalities to estimated GDP losses, drawn from survey data and our own estimates of the impact of suppression measures on the economy, means that for early suppression not to be the preferred strategy requires that Australia would have to incur more than 12,500–30,000 deaths, depending on the fatality rate with unmitigated spread, to the economy costs of early mandated suppression. We also find that early rather than delayed mandated suppression imposes much lower economy and health costs and conclude that in high-income countries, like Australia, a ‘go early, go hard’ strategy to suppress COVID-19 results in the lowest estimated public health and economy costs.","Kompas, Tom; Grafton, R.

At Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, our PTB prevention clinic manages the care of approximately 1000 women/year. Women referred to the clinic are seen from 12 weeks of pregnancy with subsequent appointments every 2–4 weeks to measure cervical length (CL) using transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS). Women with a history of cervical weakness or short cervix on TVUS are offered a cervical cerclage. LOCAL PROBLEM: During the COVID-19 outbreak, pregnant women were strongly advised to avoid social mixing and public transport. The National Health Service had to rapidly adopt remote consultation and redesign clinical pathways in order to reduce transmission, exposure and spread among women at high risk of PTB. METHODS: We focused on Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timebound aims and used a driver diagram to visualise our changes. We used a series of Plan Do Study Act cycles to evaluate and adapt change ideas through the UK’s national lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic between 23 March and 29 May 2020. RESULTS: We reduced the number of face-to-face appointments by 54%. This was achieved by increasing remote telephone consultations from 0% to 64%, and by reducing the intensity of surveillance. The rate of regional anaesthetic was increased from 53% to 95% for cerclage placement in order to minimise the number of aerosol-generating procedures. Patient and staff satisfaction responses to these changes were used to tailor practices. No women tested positive for COVID-19 during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: By using quality improvement methodology, we were able to safely and rapidly implement a new care pathway for women at high risk of PTB which was acceptable to patients and staff, and effective in reducing exposure of COVID-19.","Zarasvand, Sara; Bayar, Erna; Adan, Malko; Mountain, Katherine; Lewis, Holly; Joash, Karen; Teoh, TG; Bennett, Phillip R; Das, Sabrina; Sykes, Lynne",BMJ Open Qual,281,20

Many candidate subunit vaccines have been expressed in this system and immunization commonly led to protective immunity against pathogen challenge. The first vaccines produced in insect cells for animal use are now on the market. This chapter deals with the tailoring of the baculovirus–insect cell expression system for vaccine production in terms of expression levels, integrity and immunogenicity of recombinant proteins, and baculovirus genome stability. Various expression strategies are discussed including chimeric, virus‐like particles, baculovirus display of foreign antigens on budded virions or in occlusion bodies, and specialized baculovirus vectors with mammalian promoters that express the antigen in the immunized individual. A historical overview shows the wide variety of viral (glyco)proteins that have successfully been expressed in this system for vaccine purposes. The potential of this expression system for antiparasite vaccines is illustrated. The combination of subunit vaccines and marker tests, both based on antigens expressed in insect cells, provides a powerful tool to combat disease and to monitor infectious agents.","van Oers, Monique M.",Adv Virus Res,281,21

First, I analyse the virus itself and how its stealthy nature has transformed our lives. Second, I describe how the invisible epidemic of social media sharing of fake news about the virus worsens the situation further. Third, I explore how the virus has revealed to us what really matters in our lives and has forced us to re-evaluate our priorities. Fourth, I go on to explore the underlying structural weaknesses and disparities in society that have been exposed by the virus but previously remained unconsidered for so long that they too have become camouflaged, even if their effects are all too apparent; like the virus, neoliberal capitalism is an invisible enemy that has made prisoners of us all. I conclude by suggesting that the coronavirus pandemic represents a hidden opportunity to overcome perhaps the biggest invisible enemy of all: the moral distance that separates us from others.

Vast resources have been allocated to control the pandemic and treat patients. However, little attention has been paid to the adverse impact on mental health or effective mitigation strategies to improve mental health. (2) Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the adverse impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Chinese college students’ mental health, understand the underlying mechanisms, and explore feasible mitigation strategies. (3) Methods: During the peak time of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we conducted longitudinal surveys of sixty-six college students. Structured questionnaires collected information on demographics, physical activity, negative emotions, sleep quality, and aggressiveness level. A mixed-effect model was used to evaluate associations between variables, and the mediating effect of sleep quality was further explored. A generalized additive model was used to determine the dose-response relationships between the COVID-19 death count, physical activity, and negative emotions. (4) Results: The COVID-19 death count showed a direct negative impact on general sleep quality (β = 1.37, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.55, 2.19) and reduced aggressiveness (β = −6.57, 95% CI: −12.78, −0.36). In contrast, the COVID-19 death count imposed not a direct but an indirect impact on general negative emotions (indirect effect (IE) = 0.81, p = 0.012), stress (IE = 0.40, p < 0.001), and anxiety (IE = 0.27, p = 0.004) with sleep quality as a mediator. Moreover, physical activity directly alleviated general negative emotions (β = −0.12, 95% CI: −0.22, −0.01), and the maximal mitigation effect occurred when weekly physical activity was about 2500 METs. (5) Conclusions: (a) The severity of the COVID-19 outbreak has an indirect effect on negative emotions by affecting sleep quality. (b) A possible mitigation strategy for improving mental health includes taking suitable amounts of daily physical activity and sleeping well. (c) The COVID-19 outbreak has reduced people’s aggressiveness, probably by making people realize the fragility and preciousness of life.","Zhang, Yao; Zhang, Haoyu; Ma, Xindong; Di, Qian",Int J Environ Res Public Health,281,16

METHODS: The study comprised of two components: a retrospective cohort study of all eligible patients who attended anticoagulation clinic over 1‐year period (6 months before and 6 months after service transition) and a cross‐sectional survey of eligible patients who agreed to provide data about their satisfaction with the new service. Monitoring parameters, clinical outcomes, and resource utilization related to warfarin therapy were compared before and after service transition. Patients' experience was explored through a structured survey. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between clinic‐based and phone‐based anticoagulation services in mean time and number of visits within therapeutic range (P = .67; P = .06 respectively); mean number of extreme subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic INR values (P = .32 and P = .34, respectively); incidence of thromboembolic complications and warfarin related hospitalization. There was one reported bleeding and one emergency visit (0.9%) in the phone‐based group vs none in the clinic‐based group. Frequency of INR testing and compliance to attending clinics appointments declined significantly (P = .002; P = .001, respectively). Overall, patients were highly satisfied with the new service. The majority of patients found it better (51.6%) or just as good as the traditional service (44.5%). Patients who preferred the new service were significantly younger than their counterparts (P = .005). CONCLUSION: The service of drive‐up INR testing and phone‐based consultations was shown to be comparable to traditional anticoagulation service, a finding that supports maintaining such services as part of the new normal after the pandemic is over.","Alhmoud, Eman N.; Abd El Samad, Osama Badry; Elewa, Hazem; Alkhozondar, Ola; Soaly, Ezeldin; El Anany, Rasha",J Am Coll Clin Pharm,281,30

This study examines the impact that public health measures to control viral spread have had on orthopaedic trauma presenting to an Australian level 1 trauma centre. We hypothesized that the volume of orthopaedic trauma in the period of social distancing would decrease, and the mechanisms of injury differ, compared to pre‐pandemic times. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients requiring emergency orthopaedic surgery between 16 March and 21 April 2020 (the period after social distancing and lockdown commenced), and compared it to the group of patients from the same period in 2019. We collected demographic data, as well as injury type, anatomical location, mechanism of injury and surgical logistics. RESULTS: During the COVID‐19 period, total emergency operations performed decreased by 15.6% compared to the same period in 2019. Orthopaedic admissions decreased by 30.8%. Demographics of the groups were unchanged. Anaesthetic time decreased, but total time spent in the operating theatre was unchanged. Road trauma comprised a similar proportion of cases overall; however, cycling‐related accidents increased significantly, making up 11% of presentations during COVID‐19. Sporting injuries, work‐related injuries and multi‐traumas reduced during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The impact of COVID‐19‐related lockdown measures and social distancing on orthopaedic trauma in Australia has been an overall decrease in volume of cases, combined with significant changes in the mechanisms of injury necessitating surgery.","Probert, Annabel C.; Sivakumar, Brahman S.; An, Vincent; Nicholls, Sarah L.; Shatrov, Jobe G.; Symes, Michael J.; Ellis, Andrew M.",ANZ J Surg,281,16

We hypothesized that autophagy flux altered by CQ has a considerable influence on the lipid composition of endothelial cells. Thus, we investigated endothelial responses induced by CQ on human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). HMEC-1 cells after CQ exposure were measured using a combined methodology based on label-free Raman and fluorescence imaging. Raman spectroscopy was applied to characterize subtle chemical changes in lipid contents and their distribution in the cells, while the fluorescence staining (LipidTox, LysoTracker and LC3) was used as a reference method. The results showed that CQ was not toxic to endothelial cells and did not result in the endothelial inflammation at concentrations of 1–30 µM. Notwithstanding, it yielded an increased intensity of LipidTox, LysoTracker, and LC3 staining, suggesting changes in the content of neutral lipids, lysosomotropism, and autophagy inhibition, respectively. The CQ-induced endothelial response was associated with lipid accumulation and was characterized by Raman spectroscopy. CQ-induced autophagosome accumulation in the endothelium is featured by a pronounced alteration in the lipid profile, but not in the endothelial inflammation. Raman-based assessment of CQ-induced biochemical changes offers a better understanding of the autophagy mechanism in the endothelial cells.","Bik, Ewelina; Mateuszuk, Lukasz; Orleanska, Jagoda; Baranska, Malgorzata; Chlopicki, Stefan; Majzner, Katarzyna",Int J Mol Sci,281,16

Telehealth and telemedicine services, especially, fulfilled their promise by allowing patients to receive advice and care at a distance, making it safer for all concerned. Over the preceding years, professional societies, governments, and scholars examined ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) related to telemedicine and telehealth. Primary concerns evident from reviewing this literature have been quality of care, access, consent, and privacy. OBJECTIVES: To identify and summarize ethical, legal, and social issues related to information technology in healthcare, as exemplified by telehealth and telemedicine. To expand on prior analyses and address gaps illuminated by the COVID-19 experience. To propose future research directions. METHODS: Literature was identified through searches, forward and backward citation chaining, and the author’s knowledge of scholars and works in the area. EU and professional organizations’ guidelines, and nineteen scholarly papers were examined and categories created to identify ethical, legal, and social issues they addressed. A synthesis matrix was developed to categorize issues addressed by each source. RESULTS: A synthesis matrix was developed and issues categorized as: quality of care, consent and autonomy, access to care and technology, legal and regulatory, clinician responsibilities, patient responsibilities, changed relationships, commercialization, policy, information needs, and evaluation, with subcategories that fleshed out each category. The literature primarily addressed quality of care, access, consent, and privacy. Other identified considerations were little discussed. These and newer concerns include: usability, tailoring services to each patient, curriculum and training, implementation, commercialization, and licensing and liability. The need for interoperability, data availability, cybersecurity, and informatics infrastructure also is more apparent. These issues are applicable to other information technologies in healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and organizations need updated guidelines for ethical use of telemedicine and telehealth care, and decision- and policy-makers need evidence to inform decisions. The variety of newly implemented telemedicine services is an on-going natural experiment presenting an unparalleled opportunity to develop an evidence-based way forward. The paper recommends evaluation using an applied ethics, context-sensitive approach that explores interactions among multiple factors and considerations. It suggests evaluation questions to investigate ethical, social, and legal issues through multi-method, sociotechnical, interpretive and ethnographic, and interactionist evaluation approaches. Such evaluation can help telehealth, and other information technologies, be integrated into healthcare ethically and effectively.","Kaplan, Bonnie",Int J Med Inform,281,24

Most severe viral disease outbreaks occur in developing regions where health conditions are poor. With increased international travel and business, the possibility of eventually transmitting infectious viruses between different countries is increasing. The most effective approach in preventing viral diseases is vaccination. However, vaccines are not currently available for numerous viral diseases. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are engineered vaccine candidates that have been studied for decades. VLPs are constructed by viral protein expression in various expression systems that promote the selfassembly of proteins into structures resembling virus particles. VLPs have antigenicity similar to that of the native virus, but are non-infectious as they lack key viral genetic material. VLP vaccines have attracted considerable research interest because they offer several advantages over traditional vaccines. Studies have shown that VLP vaccines can stimulate both humoral and cellular immune responses, which may offer effective antiviral protection. Here we review recent developments with VLP-based vaccines for several highly virulent emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases. The infectious agents discussed include RNA viruses from different virus families, such as the Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Togaviridae families.","Liu, Jinliang; Dai, Shiyu; Wang, Manli; Hu, Zhihong; Wang, Hualin; Deng, Fei",Virol Sin,281,20

Since SARS-CoV-2 has an EC50 of 16.4 μg/ml for LPV this could be due to inadequate dosing. Methods: COVID-19 positive patients admitted to the hospital who received high dose LPV/RTV were included. High dose (HD) LPV/RTV 200/50 mg was defined as four tablets bid as loading dose, then three tablets bid for up to 10 days. Trough plasma concentrations were measured after the loading dose and on day 5–7 in steady state (SS). Post loading dose (PLD) and SS plasma trough levels were compared with SS trough levels from COVID-19 patients who received normal dose (ND) LPV/RTV (2 tablets bid) at the beginning of the pandemic. Results: Fifty patients (30% female) with a median age of 59 years (interquartile range 49–70.25) received HD LPV/RTV. Median HD-PLD concentration was 24.9 μg/ml (IQR 15.8–30.3) and significantly higher than HD-SS (12.9 μg/ml, IQR 7.2–19.5, p < 0.001) and ND-SS (13.6 μg/ml, IQR 10.1–22.2, p = 0.013). HD-SS and ND-SS plasma levels did not differ significantly (p = 0.507). C-reactive-protein showed a positive correlation with HD-SS (Spearman correlation-coefficient rS = 0.42, p = 0.014) and ND-SS (rS = 0.81, p = 0.015) but not with HD-PLD (rS = 0.123, p = 0.43). Conclusion: HD-PLD plasma trough concentration was significantly higher than HD-SS and ND-SS concentration, but no difference was detected between HD-SS and ND-SS trough levels. Due to the high EC50 of SARS-CoV-2 and the fact that LPV/RTV is highly protein bound, it seems unlikely that LPV/RTV exhibits a relevant antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.","Karolyi, Mario; Omid, Sara; Pawelka, Erich; Jilma, Bernd; Stimpfl, Thomas; Schoergenhofer, Christian; Laferl, Hermann; Seitz, Tamara; Traugott, Marianna; Wenisch, Christoph; Zoufaly, Alexander",Front Pharmacol,281,1

Indicators of BRD often used in feedlots such as visual signs, rectal temperature, computer-assisted lung auscultation (CALA) score, the number of BRD treatments, presence of viral pathogens, viral seroconversion, and lung damage at slaughter vary in their ability to predict an animal’s BRD outcome, and no studies have been published determining how a combination of these BRD indicators may define the number of BRD disease outcome groups. The objectives of the current study were (1) to identify BRD outcome groups using BRD indicators collected during the feeding phase and at slaughter through latent class analysis (LCA) and (2) to determine the importance of these BRD indicators to predict disease outcome. Animals with BRD (n = 127) were identified by visual signs and removed from production pens for further examination. Control animals displaying no visual signs of BRD (n = 143) were also removed and examined. Blood, nasal swab samples, and clinical measurements were collected. Lung and pleural lesions indicative of BRD were scored at slaughter. LCA was applied to identify possible outcome groups. Three latent classes were identified in the best model fit, categorized as non-BRD, mild BRD, and severe BRD. Animals in the mild BRD group had a higher probability of having visual signs of BRD compared with non-BRD and severe BRD animals. Animals in the severe BRD group were more likely to require more than 1 treatment for BRD and have ≥40 °C rectal temperature, ≥10% total lung consolidation, and severe pleural lesions at slaughter. Animals in the severe BRD group were also more likely to be naïve at feedlot entry and the first BRD pull for Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus, Bovine Parainfluenza 3 Virus, and Bovine Adenovirus and have a positive nasal swab result for Bovine Herpesvirus Type 1 and Bovine Coronavirus. Animals with severe BRD had 0.9 and 0.6 kg/d lower overall ADG (average daily gain) compared with non-BRD animals and mild BRD animals (P < 0.001). These results demonstrate that there are important indicators of BRD severity. Using this information to predict an animal’s BRD outcome would greatly enhance treatment efficacy and aid in better management of animals at risk of suffering from severe BRD.","Blakebrough-Hall, Claudia; Hick, Paul; González, Luciano A",J Anim Sci,281,1

Here, we identified heparan sulfate proteoglycans as attachment receptors for SARS-CoV-2. Notably, neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 isolated from COVID-19 patients interfered with SARS-CoV-2 binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which might be an additional mechanism of antibodies to neutralize infection. SARS-CoV-2 binding to and infection of epithelial cells was blocked by low molecular weight heparins (LMWH). Although dendritic cells (DCs) and mucosal Langerhans cells (LCs) were not infected by SARS-CoV-2, both DC subsets efficiently captured SARS-CoV-2 via heparan sulfate proteoglycans and transmitted the virus to ACE2-positive cells. Notably, human primary nasal cells were infected by SARS-CoV-2, and infection was blocked by pre-treatment with LMWH. These data strongly suggest that heparan sulfate proteoglycans are important attachment receptors facilitating infection and transmission, and support the use of LMWH as prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Bermejo-Jambrina, Marta; Eder, Julia; Kaptein, Tanja M; van Hamme, John L; Helgers, Leanne C; Vlaming, Killian E; Brouwer, Philip J M; van Nuenen, Ad C; Spaargaren, Marcel; de Bree, Godelieve J; Nijmeijer, Bernadien M; Kootstra, Neeltje A; van Gils, Marit J; Sanders, Rogier W; Geijtenbeek, Teunis B H",EMBO J,281,1

This study examined the association between preinfection blood pressure (BP) control and COVID-19 outcomes using data from 460 general practices in England. Eligible patients were adults with hypertension who were tested or diagnosed with COVID-19. BP control was defined by the most recent BP reading within 24 months of the index date (January 1, 2020). BP was defined as controlled (<130/80 mm Hg), raised (130/80–139/89 mm Hg), stage 1 uncontrolled (140/90–159/99 mm Hg), or stage 2 uncontrolled (≥160/100 mm Hg). The primary outcome was death within 28 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. Secondary outcomes were COVID-19 diagnosis and COVID-19–related hospital admission. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between BP control and outcomes. Of the 45 418 patients (mean age, 67 years; 44.7% male) included, 11 950 (26.3%) had controlled BP. These patients were older, had more comorbidities, and had been diagnosed with hypertension for longer. A total of 4277 patients (9.4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 877 died within 28 days. Individuals with stage 1 uncontrolled BP had lower odds of COVID-19 death (odds ratio, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.62–0.92]) compared with patients with well-controlled BP. There was no association between BP control and COVID-19 diagnosis or hospitalization. These findings suggest BP control may be associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes, possibly due to these patients having more advanced atherosclerosis and target organ damage. Such patients may need to consider adhering to stricter social distancing, to limit the impact of COVID-19 as future waves of the pandemic occur.","Sheppard, James P.; Nicholson, Brian D.; Lee, Joseph; McGagh, Dylan; Sherlock, Julian; Koshiaris, Constantinos; Oke, Jason; Jones, Nicholas R.; Hinton, William; Armitage, Laura; Van Hecke, Oliver; Lay-Flurrie, Sarah; Bankhead, Clare R.; Liyanage, Harshana; Williams, John; Ferreira, Filipa; Feher, Michael D.; Ashworth, Andrew J.; Joy, Mark P.; de Lusignan, Simon; Hobbs, F.D.

METHODS: An online survey was run from February 19 to March 6, 2020; a total of 2,182 Chinese subjects participated. Mental health variables were assessed via the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Symptom Check List-revised (SCL-90-R), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), which included a 2-item anxiety scale and a 2-item depression scale (PHQ-2). RESULTS: Compared with nonmedical health workers (n = 1,255), medical health workers (n = 927) had a higher prevalence of insomnia (38.4 vs. 30.5%, p < 0.01), anxiety (13.0 vs. 8.5%, p < 0.01), depression (12.2 vs. 9.5%; p< 0.04), somatization (1.6 vs. 0.4%; p < 0.01), and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (5.3 vs. 2.2%; p < 0.01). They also had higher total scores of ISI, GAD-2, PHQ-2, and SCL-90-R obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p ≤ 0.01). Among medical health workers, having organic disease was an independent factor for insomnia, anxiety, depression, somatization, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p < 0.05 or 0.01). Living in rural areas, being female, and being at risk of contact with COVID-19 patients were the most common risk factors for insomnia, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and depression (p < 0.01 or 0.05). Among nonmedical health workers, having organic disease was a risk factor for insomnia, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p < 0.01 or 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, medical health workers had psychosocial problems and risk factors for developing them.

Understanding the fast evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. Methods We collected individual information on 8,579 laboratory-confirmed cases from official publically sources reported outside Hubei in mainland China, as of February 17, 2020. We estimated the temporal variation of the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level. Results The median age of the cases was 44 years, with an increasing of cases in younger age groups and the elderly as the epidemic progressed. The delay from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4.4 days (95%CI: 0.0-14.0) until January 27 to 2.6 days (0.0-9.0) from January 28 to February 17. The mean incubation period was estimated at 5.2 days (1.8-12.4) and the mean serial interval at 5.1 days (1.3-11.6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei was highly variable, but consistently included a mix of case importations and local transmission. We estimate that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than three weeks with Rt reaching peaks between 1.40 (1.04-1.85) in Shenzhen City of Guangdong Province and 2.17 (1.69-2.76) in Shandong Province. In all the analyzed locations (n=10) Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold since the end of January. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the strict containment measures and movement restrictions in place may contribute to the interruption of local COVID-19 transmission outside Hubei Province. The shorter serial interval estimated here implies that transmissibility is not as high as initial estimates suggested.","Zhang, Juanjuan; Litvinova, Maria; Wang, Wei; Wang, Yan; Deng, Xiaowei; Chen, Xinghui; Li, Mei; Zheng, Wen; Yi, Lan; Chen, Xinhua; Wu, Qianhui; Liang, Yuxia; Wang, Xiling; Yang, Juan; Sun, Kaiyuan; Longini, Ira M.; Halloran, M.

Collection of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and detection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) requires medical / technical expertise. A reliable and easy to handle point-of-care (POC) test is highly desirable, especially to curb transmission. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated a commercially available POC rapid antigen test (RAT) for the detection of SARS-CoV2 antigens in the saliva of RT-PCR confirmed positive and negative patients. Methods: Thirty saliva samples of 10 saliva RT-PCR negative and 20 saliva RT-PCR positive patients were tested by RAT. Results: RAT was negative in 10/10 (100%) RT-PCR-negative samples; positive in 9/20 (45%) RT-PCR-positive samples; concordance was 63% (p=0.001). Patients with positive RAT had higher virus copies in their NPS samples compared to the RAT-negative patients. This difference was also statistically significant (p=0.01). Conclusion: Thus, the POC RAT may be used to detect SARS-CoV2 as a reliable tool for self-testing, large-scale population screening and emergency medical/dental screening. Patients negative by RAT should be confirmed by RT-PCR.","Kannian, P.; Lavanya, C.; Ravichandran, K.; Jayaraman, B.

The core principle underlying the methodology is the recognition that synergistic relationships, characterised by mutual trust and respect, between affected communities and official institutions provide the most effective means of addressing outbreak situations. METHODS: The methodological approach and lessons learned were derived from four qualitative case studies including (i) two tick-borne disease events (Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in Spain, 2016, and tick-borne encephalitis in the Netherlands, 2016); and (ii) two outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis (norovirus in Iceland, 2017, and verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli [VTEC] in Ireland, 2018). An after-event qualitative case study approach was taken using mixed methods. The studies were conducted in collaboration with the respective national public health authorities in the affected countries by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The analysis focused on the specific actions undertaken by the participating countries’ public health and other authorities in relation to community engagement, as well as the view from the perspective of affected communities. RESULTS: Lessons highlight the critical importance of collaborating with ECDC National Focal Points during preparation and planning and with anthropological experts. Field work for each case study was conducted over one working week, which although limiting the number of individuals and institutions involved, still allowed for rich data collection due to the close collaboration with local authorities. The methodology enabled efficient extraction of synergies between authorities and communities. Implementing the methodology required a reflexivity among fieldworkers that ackowledges that different versions of reality can co-exist in the social domain. The method allowed for potential generalisability across studies. Issues of extra attention included insider-outsider perspectives, politically sensitivity of findings, and how to deal with ethical and language issues. CONCLUSIONS: The overall objective of the assessment is to identify synergies between institutional decision-making bodies and community actors and networks before, during and after an outbreak response to a given public health emergency. The methodology is generic and could be applied to a range of public health emergencies, zoonotic or otherwise.","de Vries, Daniel H.; Kinsman, John; Takacs, Judit; Tsolova, Svetla; Ciotti, Massimo",BMC Health Serv Res,281,20

Further study is necessary to better diagnose and treat COVID-19 patients. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of an 8-year-old boy admitted with status epilepticus, who also tested positive for COVID-19, while afebrile, with no initial respiratory symptoms. Benzodiazepines were given per treatment guidelines, abating the seizure activity. He subsequently developed respiratory distress and desaturation requiring temporary emergent intubation. All clinical symptoms resolved within a few hours. Results of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain were within normal limits. Results of a 24-h electroencephalogram (EEG) were abnormal, indicative of diffuse cerebral dysfunction. As a result of intubation and findings of bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, a COVID-19 test was administered and the result was positive.

Understanding the effectiveness of the various strategies used for POR is, therefore, of vital importance to countries certified as “malaria-free” or to the countries to be thus certified in the near future. This review is based on extensive review of literature on both the POR strategies and elimination schemes of countries, (i) that have reached malaria-free status (e.g. Armenia, Mauritius, Sri Lanka), (ii) those that are reaching pre-elimination stage (e.g. South Korea), and (iii) countries at the control phase (e.g. India). History has clearly shown that poorly implemented POR programmes can result in deadly consequences (e.g. Sri Lanka); conversely, there are examples of robust POR programmes that have sustained malaria free status that can serve as examples to countries working toward elimination. Countries awaiting malaria elimination status should pre-plan their POR strategies. Malaria-free countries face the risk of resurgence mostly due to imported malaria cases; thus, a robust passenger screening programme and cross border collaborations are crucial in a POR setting. In addition, sustained vigilance, and continued funding for the national anti-malarial campaign programme and for related research is of vital importance for POR. With distinct intrinsic potential for malaria in each country, tailor-made POR programmes are built through continuous and robust epidemiological and entomological surveillance, particularly in countries such as Sri Lanka with increased receptivity and vulnerability for malaria transmission. In summary, across all five countries under scrutiny, common strengths of the POR programmes are (i) a multipronged approach, (ii) strong passive, active, and activated passive case detection, (iii) Indoor residual spraying (IRS), and (iv) health education/awareness programmes.","Nasir, S.

Many studies have used AR/VR to deliver training, providing mixed evidence on their effectiveness and limited evidence regarding contextual factors that influence effectiveness and implementation. This review will develop, test and refine an evidence-informed programme theory on what facilitates or constrains the implementation of AR or VR programmes in health and care settings and understand how, for whom and to what extent they ‘work’. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This realist review adheres to the Realist And Meta-narrative Evidence Syntheses: Evolving Standards (RAMESES) standards and will be conducted in three steps: theory elicitation, theory testing and theory refinement. First, a search will identify practitioner, academic and learning and technology adoption theories from databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, Embase, Education Resources Information Center, PsycINFO and Web of Science), practitioner journals, snowballing and grey literature. Information regarding contexts, mechanisms and outcomes will be extracted. A narrative synthesis will determine overlapping configurations and form an initial theory. Second, the theory will be tested using empirical evidence located from the above databases and identified from the first search. Quality will be assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT), and relevant information will be extracted into a coding sheet. Third, the extracted information will be compared with the initial programme theory, with differences helping to make refinements. Findings will be presented as a narrative summary, and the MMAT will determine our confidence in each configuration. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required. This review will develop an evidence-informed programme theory. The results will inform and support AR/VR interventions from clinical educators, healthcare providers and software developers. Upskilling through AR/VR learning interventions may improve quality of care and promote evidence-based practice and continued learning.

With the spread of parasites resistant to artemisinin combination therapies in Southeast Asia, there is a growing need to develop new antimalarials with novel targets. Invasion of the red blood cell by Plasmodium merozoites is essential for parasite survival and proliferation, thus representing an attractive target for therapeutic development. Red blood cell invasion requires a co-ordinated series of protein/protein interactions, protease cleavage events, intracellular signals, organelle release and engagement of an actin-myosin motor, which provide many potential targets for drug development. As these steps occur in the bloodstream, they are directly susceptible and exposed to drugs. A number of invasion inhibitors against a diverse range of parasite proteins involved in these different processes of invasion have been identified, with several showing potential to be optimised for improved drug-like properties. In this review, we discuss red blood cell invasion as a drug target and highlight a number of approaches for developing antimalarials with invasion inhibitory activity to use in future combination therapies.","Burns, Amy L; Dans, Madeline G; Balbin, Juan M; de Koning-Ward, Tania F; Gilson, Paul R; Beeson, James G; Boyle, Michelle J; Wilson, Danny W",FEMS Microbiol Rev,281,16

On January the 30th, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared spread of this virus as an epidemic and a public health emergency. With its highly contagious characteristic and long incubation time, confinement of SARS-CoV-2 requires drastic lock-down measures to be taken and therefore early diagnosis is crucial. We analysed transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 infected human lung epithelial cells, compared it with mock-infected cells, used network-based reporter metabolite approach and integrated the transcriptome data with protein-protein interaction network to elucidate the early cellular response. Significantly affected metabolites have the potential to be used in diagnostics while pathways of protein clusters have the potential to be used as targets for supportive or novel therapeutic approaches. Our results are in accordance with the literature on response of IL6 family of cytokines and their importance, in addition, we find that matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) with keratan sulfate synthesis pathway may play a key role in the infection.

Here, we report a case series of five mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 infection who developed pneumothorax. Consecutive cases of intubated patients in the intensive care unit with the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and pneumothorax were included. Data on their demographics, preexisting risk factors, laboratory workup, imaging findings, treatment, and survival were collected retrospectively between March and July 2020. Four out of five patients (4/5; 80%) had a bilateral pneumothorax, while one had a unilateral pneumothorax. Of the four patients with bilateral pneumothorax, three (3/4; 75%) had secondary bacterial pneumonia, two had pneumomediastinum and massive subcutaneous emphysema, and one of these two had an additional pneumoperitoneum. A surgical chest tube or pigtail catheter was placed for the management of pneumothorax. Three out of five patients with pneumothorax died (3/5; 60%), and all of them had bilateral involvement.

We aimed to test the validity of qFIT as a prioritisation tool in patients with iron deficiency and its ability to identify patients with advanced neoplastic lesions (ANLs). Data collected from patients referred with biochemically proven iron deficiency (ferritin ≤ 15 μg/L) and synchronous qFIT who underwent full gastrointestinal investigation within NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde was analysed retrospectively. Patients who did not undergo full investigation, defined as gastroscopy and colonoscopy or CT colonography, were excluded. ANLs were defined as defined as upper GI cancer, colorectal adenoma ≥ 1 cm or colorectal cancer. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis was performed on qFIT results and outcome, defined as the presence of an ANL. AUC analysis guided cut-off scores for qFIT. Patients with a qFIT of <10, 10–200, >200, were allocated a score of 1, 2, and 3, respectively. A total of 575 patients met criteria for inclusion into the study. Overall, qFIT results strongly predicted the presence of ANLs (AUC 0.87, CI 0.81–0.92; P < 0.001). The prevalence of ANLs in patients with scores 1–3 was 1.2, 13.5, and 38.9% respectfully. When controlled for other significant variables, patients with a higher qFIT score were statistically more likely to have an ANL (qFIT score = 2; OR 12.8; P < 0.001, qFIT score = 3, OR 50.0; P < 0.001). A negative qFIT had a high NPV for the presence of ANLs (98.8%, CI 97.0–99.5%). These results strongly suggest that qFIT has validity as a prioritisation tool in patients with iron deficiency; both allowing for a more informed decision of investigation of patients with very low risk of malignancy, and in identifying higher risk patients who may benefit from more urgent endoscopy.","Clackett, William; Barclay, Stephen T.; Stanley, Adrian J.; Cahill, Aidan",Front Med (Lausanne),281,6

The Chinese Government has carried out a series of emergency preparedness education and training programmes to improve the emergency preparedness capability of rural public health personnel nationwide. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and develop a participatory emergency preparedness training programme for rural public health personnel. STUDY DESIGN: The research emphasizes the major components of instructional design, including assessing, designing, delivering and evaluating training. The approach is an integrated system with results from one phase influencing the next, so that a series of steps are followed when developing, implementing and evaluating emergency preparedness training. METHODS: The 226 participants were rural public health personnel from 84 different rural centres for disease control and prevention in China. The programme was evaluated by anonymous questionnaires and semi-structured interviews held prior to training, immediately post-training and 12-months after training (follow-up). RESULTS: The emergency preparedness training resulted in positive shifts in knowledge and skills for rural public health personnel. At follow-up, the knowledge and skill scores of participants declined slightly compared with the post-test levels (P > 0.05). However, there was a significant increase compared with the pre-test levels (P < 0.01). Moreover, more than 90% of participants reported that this training provided a valuable learning experience and reinforced the importance of emergency preparedness.

However, bacterial coinfection is considered relatively infrequent in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and the co-prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae is low. MATERIAL/METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients subsequently admitted to AMITA Health Saint Francis Hospital between March 1 and June 30, 2020, with documented SARS-CoV-2 and S. pneumoniae coinfection. RESULTS: We identified 11 patients with S. pneumoniae coinfection. The median age was 77 years (interquartile range [IQR], 74–82 years), 45.5% (5/11) were males, 54.5% (6/11) were white, and 90.9% (10/11) were long-term care facility (LTCF) residents. The median length of stay was 7 days (IQR, 6–8 days). Among 11 patients, 4 were discharged in stable condition and 7 had died, resulting in an inpatient mortality rate of 64%. CONCLUSIONS: At our center, 11 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who had confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 were diagnosed with Streptococcus pneumoniae infection while in hospital. All patients had pneumonia confirmed on imaging and a nonspecific increase in markers of inflammation. The in-hospital mortality rate of 64% (7 patients) was higher in this group than in previous reports.

Most strategies are discriminative, i.e. have involved ‘forward’ problems (have molecule, establish properties). However, we normally wish to solve the much harder generative or inverse problem (describe desired properties, find molecule). ‘Deep’ (machine) learning based on large-scale neural networks underpins technologies such as computer vision, natural language processing, driverless cars, and world-leading performance in games such as Go; it can also be applied to the solution of inverse problems in chemical biology. In particular, recent developments in deep learning admit the in silico generation of candidate molecular structures and the prediction of their properties, thereby allowing one to navigate (bio)chemical space intelligently. These methods are revolutionary but require an understanding of both (bio)chemistry and computer science to be exploited to best advantage. We give a high-level (non-mathematical) background to the deep learning revolution, and set out the crucial issue for chemical biology and informatics as a two-way mapping from the discrete nature of individual molecules to the continuous but high-dimensional latent representation that may best reflect chemical space. A variety of architectures can do this; we focus on a particular type known as variational autoencoders. We then provide some examples of recent successes of these kinds of approach, and a look towards the future.","Kell, Douglas B.; Samanta, Soumitra; Swainston, Neil",Biochem J,281,26

Here, we analyze the replication ability of this new variant in different cellular models using for comparison an ancestral D614G European strain (lineage B1). Results from comparative replication kinetics experiments in vitro and in a human reconstituted bronchial epithelium showed no difference. However, when both viruses were put in competition in human reconstituted bronchial epithelium, the 20I/501Y.V1 variant outcompeted the ancestral strain.

However, since the introduction of immunomodulatory therapy, the value of these biomarkers is unclear. We investigated PCT and CRP kinetics in critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with dexamethasone with or without tocilizumab, and assessed the value of these biomarkers to detect secondary bacterial infections. METHODS: In this prospective study, 190 critically ill COVID-19 patients were divided into three treatment groups: no dexamethasone, no tocilizumab (D−T−), dexamethasone, no tocilizumab (D+T−), and dexamethasone and tocilizumab (D+T+). Serial data of PCT and CRP were aligned on the last day of dexamethasone treatment, and kinetics of these biomarkers were analyzed between 6 days prior to cessation of dexamethasone and 10 days afterwards. Furthermore, the D+T− and D+T+ groups were subdivided into secondary infection and no-secondary infection groups to analyze differences in PCT and CRP kinetics and calculate detection accuracy of these biomarkers for the occurrence of a secondary infection. RESULTS: Following cessation of dexamethasone, there was a rebound in PCT and CRP levels, most pronounced in the D+T− group. Upon occurrence of a secondary infection, no significant increase in PCT and CRP levels was observed in the D+T− group (p = 0.052 and p = 0.08, respectively). Although PCT levels increased significantly in patients of the D+T+ group who developed a secondary infection (p = 0.0003), this rise was only apparent from day 2 post-infection onwards. CRP levels remained suppressed in the D+T+ group. Receiver operating curve analysis of PCT and CRP levels yielded area under the curves of 0.52 and 0.55, respectively, which are both markedly lower than those found in the group of COVID-19 patients not treated with immunomodulatory drugs (0.80 and 0.76, respectively, with p values for differences between groups of 0.001 and 0.02, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Cessation of dexamethasone in critically ill COVID-19 patients results in a rebound increase in PCT and CRP levels unrelated to the occurrence of secondary bacterial infections. Furthermore, immunomodulatory treatment with dexamethasone and tocilizumab considerably reduces the value of PCT and CRP for detection of secondary infections in COVID-19 patients.

However, there is a lack of published rehabilitation strategies and treatments that can maximize engagement and outcomes among adolescents in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Virtual reality (VR) gaming using a head-mounted display (HMD) and adaptive software can allow active and nonactive gameplay at the bedside for people with limited arm mobility, making it a potentially inclusive and enjoyable treatment modality for adolescents in the PICU. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this brief case study is to report on the preliminary feasibility of incorporating adaptive VR gaming using an HMD with 2 adolescents who received early mobility treatment within the PICU. METHODS: This study was a mini-ethnographic investigation of 2 adolescents (a 15-year-old male and a 13-year old male) in the PICU who underwent VR gaming sessions as part of their early mobilization care, using an Oculus Rift HMD and adaptive software (WalkinVR) that promoted full gameplay in bed. The Rift was plugged into a gaming laptop that was set up on a table within the patient’s room before each session. The intervention was delivered by an adapted exercise professional and supervised by a physical therapist. Patients had access to a variety of active games (eg, boxing, rhythmic movement to music, and exploratory adventure) and nonactive games (eg, racing and narrative adventure). Gaming sessions were scheduled between usual care, when tolerable and requested by the participant. The interventionist and therapists took audio-recorded and written notes after completing each gaming session. These data were analyzed and presented in a narrative format from the perspective of the research team. RESULTS: Case 1 participated in 4 gaming sessions, with an average of 18 minutes (SD 11) per session. Case 2 participated in 2 sessions, with an average of 35 minutes (SD 7) per session. Both cases were capable of performing active gaming at a moderate level of exercise intensity, as indicated by their heart rate. However, their health and symptoms fluctuated on a daily basis, which prompted the gameplay of adventure or nonactive games. Gameplay appeared to improve participants’ affect and alertness and motivate them to be more engaged in early mobilization therapy. Gameplay without the WalkinVR software caused several usability issues. There were no serious adverse events, but both cases experienced symptoms based on their condition. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that VR gaming with HMDs and adaptive software is likely a feasible supplement to usual care for adolescents within the PICU, and these findings warrant further investigation.

Clinic visits, hospitalizations, surgical interventions, and medications impart notable physical, social, and financial challenges for patients. Furthermore, they place considerable strain on provider time and healthcare resources. Telemedicine has been gaining popularity for the cost and time savings achieved through remote patient monitoring. However, despite its widely reported success and acceptance, notable concerns have also emerged in its capacity to manage patients with varying degrees of disease activity, comorbid disabilities, and limitations to the access to technological services. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We will search PubMed, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Google Scholar databases using key terms to extract articles assessing telemedicine in IBD management. Articles published between January 2000 and May 2021 will be included. Two rounds of literature review using a three-step method will be performed.

I then use an integrable nonautonomous Lotka–Volterra model to study the interactions among these searches in three U.S. States (Mississippi, Nevada and Utah), the District of Columbia and in the U.S. as a whole. I find that the results are very similar in all areas analyzed, and for different specifications of the model. Prior to the pandemic outbreak, the interactions among health searches, unemployment searches and news consumption are very weak, i.e. an increase in searches for one of these topics does not affect the amount of searches for the others. However, from around the beginning of the pandemic these interactions intensify greatly, suggesting that the pandemic has created a tight link between the health and economic situation and the amount of news people consume. I observe that from March 2020 unemployment predates searches for news and for symptoms. Consequently, whenever searches for unemployment increase, all the other searches decrease. Conversely, when searches for any of the other topics considered increase, searches for unemployment also increase. This underscores the importance of mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment to avoid that this issue swallows all others in the mind of the people.","Sotis, Chiara",Qual Quant,281,21

HPAIV H5N8B showed increased virulence with rapid onset of severe disease and mortality in Pekin ducks due to pronounced neuro- and hepatotropism. Cross-species infection was evaluated in mice, ferrets, and in a human lung explant culture model. While the H5N8B isolate was highly virulent for Balb/c mice, virulence and transmissibility were grossly reduced in ferrets, which was mirrored by marginal replication in human lung cultures infected ex vivo. Our data indicate that the 2016 HPAIV H5N8B is avian-adapted with augmented virulence for waterfowl, but has low zoonotic potential.

To help clinicians in the rapid triage of patients at high risk of COVID-19 while waiting for RT-PCR results, different diagnostic prediction models have been developed. Our objective is to identify, compare, and evaluate performances of prediction models for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in adult patients in a health care setting. METHODS: A search for relevant references has been conducted on the MEDLINE and Scopus databases. Rigorous eligibility criteria have been established (e.g., adult participants, suspicion of COVID-19, medical setting) and applied by two independent investigators to identify suitable studies at 2 different stages: (1) titles and abstracts screening and (2) full-texts screening. Risk of bias (RoB) has been assessed using the Prediction model study Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). Data synthesis has been presented according to a narrative report of findings. RESULTS: Out of the 2334 references identified by the literature search, 13 articles have been included in our systematic review. The studies, carried out all over the world, were performed in 2020. The included articles proposed a model developed using different methods, namely, logistic regression, score, machine learning, XGBoost. All the included models performed well to discriminate adults at high risks of presenting COVID-19 (all area under the ROC curve (AUROC) > 0.500). The best AUROC was observed for the model of Kurstjens et al (AUROC = 0.940 (0.910–0.960), which was also the model that achieved the highest sensitivity (98%). RoB was evaluated as low in general.

Here, we report a unique case of a child with viral pneumonia caused by coinfection with human metapneumovirus (MPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and SARS‐CoV‐2 after HSCT. CASE REPORT: A 9‐year‐old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia underwent allogeneic HSCT from a matched, unrelated donor. During the posttransplant period, in profound leukopenia (below 10 leukocytes/µL), she was diagnosed with SARS‐CoV‐2, MPV and RSV pneumonia and was treated with ribavirin and chloroquine. Before leukocyte recovery, the girl became asymptomatic, and SARS‐CoV‐2 and RSV clearance was achieved. The shedding of SARS‐CoV‐2 stopped before immune system recovery, and one may hypothesize that the lack of an inflammatory response might have been a contributing factor to the mild clinical course. CONCLUSIONS: Posttransplant care in HSCT recipients with COVID‐19 infection is feasible in regular transplant units, provided the patient does not present with respiratory failure. Early and repeated testing for SARS‐CoV‐2 in posttransplant patients with concomitant infection mitigation strategies should be considered in children after HSCT who develop fever, respiratory symptoms and perhaps gastrointestinal symptoms to control the spread of COVID‐19 both in patients and healthcare workers in hospital environments.

Trial characteristics were double-coded. (Registration: Open Science Framework [https://osf.io/dmuzx/]). SETTING: Trials launched between January 2005 and March 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Preventive viral vaccine candidates for 23 emerging or reemerged viral infectious diseases. MEASUREMENTS: The primary end point was the probability of vaccines advancing from launch of phase 2 to FDA licensure within 10 years. RESULTS: In total, 606 clinical trials forming 220 distinct development trajectories (267 343 enrolled participants) were identified. The probability of vaccines progressing from phase 2 to licensure within 10 years was 10.0% (95% CI, 2.6% to 16.9%), with most approvals representing H1N1 or H5N1 vaccines. The average timeline from phase 2 to approval was 4.4 years (range, 6.4 weeks to 13.9 years). The probabilities of advancing from phase 1 to 2, phase 2 to 3, and phase 3 to licensure within the total available follow-up time were 38.2% (CI, 30.7% to 45.0%), 38.3% (CI, 23.1% to 50.5%), and 61.1% (CI, 3.7% to 84.3%), respectively. LIMITATIONS: The study did not account for preclinical development and relied primarily on ClinicalTrials.gov and FDA resources. Success probabilities do not capture the varied reasons why vaccines fail to advance to regulatory approval. CONCLUSION: Success probabilities and timelines varied widely across different vaccine types and diseases. If a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is licensed within 18 months of the start of the pandemic, it will mark an unprecedented achievement for noninfluenza viral vaccine development.

We aimed to assess the impact of COVID on acute stroke clinical trial conduct at sites that continued to enroll patients during the pandemic. BEST-MSU is an ongoing study of Mobile Stroke Units (MSU) vs standard management of tPA-eligible acute stroke patients in the pre-hospital setting. MSU personnel include a vascular neurologist via telemedicine, and a nurse, CT technologist, paramedics and emergency medicine technicians on-board. During COVID, consent, 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and EQ5D were obtained by phone instead of in-person, but other aspects of management were similar to the pre-COVID period. We compared patient demographics, study metrics, and infection of study personnel during intra- vs pre-COVID eras. Five of 6 BEST-MSU sites continued to enroll during COVID. There were no differences in intra- (n = 57) vs pre- (n = 869) COVID enrolled tPA eligible patients’ age, sex, race (38.6% vs 38.0% Black), ethnicity (15.8% vs 18.6% Hispanic), or NIHSS (median 11 vs 9). The percent of screened patients enrolled and adjudicated tPA eligible declined from 13.6% to 6.6% (p < .001); study enrollment correlated with local stay-at-home and reopening orders. There were no differences in alert to MSU arrival or arrival to tPA times, but MSU on-scene time was 5 min longer (p = .01). There were no differences in ED door to CT, tPA treatment or thrombectomy puncture times, hospital length of stay, discharge disposition, or remote vs in-person 90-day mRS or EQ5D. One MSU nurse tested positive but did not require hospitalization. Clinical research in the pre-hospital setting can be carried out accurately and safely during a pandemic. tPA eligibility rates declined, but otherwise there were no differences in patient demographics, deterioration of study processes, or serious infection of study staff.

The aim of this study was to describe the development of sinus bradycardia in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and its association with outcome in outbreak due to the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 Lineage. We leveraged the multi-center SuPAR in Adult Patients With COVID-19 (SPARCOL) study and identified patients who required admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Inclusion criteria were: (a) adult (≥18 years old) patients hospitalized primarily for COVID-19; (b) a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal samples; and (c) at least one blood sample collected at admission and stored for suPAR, hs-CRP, and ferritin testing. All patients had continuous heart rate monitoring during hospitalization. In total, 81 patients were included. Of them, 17 (21%) and 64 (79%) were intubated and admitted to the ICU during the first and second wave, respectively. Two (12%) and 62 (97%) developed bradycardia before ICU admission, respectively (p < 0.001). Patients with bradycardia had increased suPAR (p < 0.001) and hs-CRP level (p < 0.001). Infusion of isoprenaline and/or noradrenaline was necessary to maintain an adequate rate and peripheral perfusion in all patients. Mortality was significantly higher in patients with bradycardia (p < 0.001). In conclusion, bradycardia was associated with poor outcome. As B.1.1.7 variant strain is spreading more rapidly in many countries, our findings help in the identification of patients who may require early admission to ICU.","Chalkias, Athanasios; Pantazopoulos, Ioannis; Papagiannakis, Nikolaos; Skoulakis, Anargyros; Laou, Eleni; Kolonia, Konstantina; Ntalarizou, Nicoletta; Tourlakopoulos, Konstantinos; Pagonis, Athanasios; Kampolis, Christos; De Guadiana Romualdo, Luis García; Ragias, Dimitrios; Eugen-Olsen, Jesper; Gourgoulianis, Konstantinos; Arnaoutoglou, Eleni",Toxicol Rep,281,1

Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is characterized by cervical lymphadenopathy occurring in young adults. Neurologic involvement is rare, and testitis directly caused by Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease has not yet been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 19-year-old man was brought to our clinic with complaints of fever, headache, fatigue, and left lower quadrant pain that had persisted for 3 weeks. On physical examination, painful cervical lymphadenopathies were observed. Meningitis was suspected based on a cerebrospinal fluid examination, and left-sided orchitis was diagnosed based on findings from magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography. However, neither antibiotics nor antiviral drugs were effective in treating the patient’s symptoms. On the 20(th) day of hospitalization, the patient experienced a loss of consciousness, and brain T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed asymmetrical, high-signal intensities in both basal nuclei and the left temporal lobe. Encephalitis was suspected, and the patient was treated with intravenous prednisolone pulse therapy (1 g/day) for 3 days and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for 5 days. A left cervical lymph node biopsy showed apoptotic necrosis in paracortical and cortical areas with an abundance of macrophages and large lymphoid cells, which had irregular nuclei suggestive of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease; the pathological findings from a brain biopsy were the same as those of the cervical lymph node biopsy. The encephalitis and cervical lymphadenopathies followed a benign course, as did the testitis. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease involving painful testitis and pathologically proven asymmetrical brain regions. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease should be included in the differential diagnosis when a patient presents with encephalitis, testitis, and fever of unknown origin.","Kido, Hidenori; Kano, Osamu; Hamai, Asami; Masuda, Hiroyuki; Fuchinoue, Yutaka; Nemoto, Masaaki; Arai, Chiaki; Takeda, Teppei; Yamabe, Fumihito; Tai, Toshihiro; Kasahara, Mizuki; Suzuki, Kenichi; Shiraga, Nobuyuki; Sadamoto, Sota; Wakayama, Megumi; Takahashi, Yukitoshi; Iwasaki, Yasuo; Shibuya, Kazutoshi; Urita, Yoshihisa",BMC Neurol,281,16

However, its presence in certain populations, especially those with mild clinical symptoms, has not been clarified. The objective was to estimate the frequency of OD and TD, and its predictive validity in patients detected in Primary Care. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in the Spanish National Health System. An epidemiological survey was administered to patients who were requested the PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. Odds ratio (OR) were estimated to measure the magnitude of the association between OD and TD and the existence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of these symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 infection were calculated. RESULTS: Of 1038 patients screened, 20.1% had SARS-CoV-2 infection. OD and DG were present in 64.4% (95% CI 56.0–72.1) and 56.2% (95% CI 47.9–64.2) of the subjects with infection, respectively. The OR for OD was 12.2 (95% CI 8.26–18.06) and for TD was 7.95 (95% CI 5.48–11.53). TD presented a sensitivity of 41.1% (95% CI 34.4–46.1), a specificity of 91.9% (95% CI 89.8–93.7), a PPV of 56.2% (95% CI48.0–64.2) and a NPV of 86.1% (95% CI 83.6–88.3), while the OD showed a sensitivity of 45.0% (95% CI 37.6–51.5), a specificity of 93.7% (95% CI 91.8–95.0), a PPV of 64.4% (95% CI 56.0–72.1) and a NPV of 87.1% (95% CI 84.7–89.2). CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the subjects with SARS-CoV-2 infection have OD or TD. The presence of OD or TD could be of diagnostic utility due to its ability to predict infection in more than half of the cases.","Pérula de Torres, Luis Ángel; González-Lama, Jesús; Jiménez García, Celia; Sánchez Montero, Rosa; Rider Garrido, Faustino; Ortega López, Yolanda; Pajares Conde, Diego; Ramírez Baena, Miguel; Párraga Martínez, Ignacio; Romero-Rodríguez, Esperanza",Med Clin (Engl Ed),281,3

The analysis of multi-scale input data, the improvement of spatiotemporal Deep Belief Network (DBN), and the different pooling strategies are regarded as the focuses to improve the belief networks in deep learning (DL). Moreover, a human sports behavior recognition model is proposed based on particular spatio-temporal features. Also, video frame data are collected from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and University of Central Florida (UCF) datasets for training. The TensorFlow platform is employed to simulate the built algorithm. Finally, the constructed algorithm model is compared with the DBN proposed by Yang et al. the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) proposed by Ullah et al. and the DBN-Hidden Markov Model (HMM) algorithm proposed by Xu et al. to analyse its performance. The recognition effects of each algorithm in the two datasets are analyzed. Results demonstrate that CNN developed by Ullah et al. has the worst accuracy on the KTH and UCF datasets, followed by DBN developed by Yang et al. and DBN-HMM developed by Xu et al. The constructed algorithm model can provide the highest accuracy, reaching about 90%, and the recognition accuracy of human sports behaviors of each algorithm on the KTH dataset is lower than that on the UCF dataset. On the KTH dataset, the recognition accuracy for boxing is the highest and running the lowest. Analyzing the model’s accuracy in the four scenes (S1, S2, S3, and S4) on the KTH dataset suggests that the recognition accuracy for the indoor scene (S4) is higher than that of the outdoor scenes (S1, S2, and S3). On the UCF dataset, the recognition accuracy for lifting is the highest, reaching 99%, and that for walking is the lowest, reaching 51%. Therefore, the proposed human sports recognition model can provide a higher accuracy than other classic DL algorithms, providing an experimental basis for subsequent human sports recognition research.","Guo, Yingqing; Wang, Xin",J Supercomput,281,20

COVID-19 is highly contagious, potentially fatal, and a global public health concern. Combining optimized personal protective equipment (PPE) use and hand hygiene is the best strategy for preventing COVID-19 in health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: We conducted a national cross-sectional web-based survey of HCWs in the infection control program (IPC) in Thailand between May 5, 2020 and May 15, 2020. The primary objective was the prevalence of optimized PPE use amongst HCWs. The secondary objective was identification of the independent predictors of optimized PPE use. RESULTS: We received a response from 46% of HCWs (756/1650), and all those who responded were nurse or HCWs who were registered in the IPC network. Five HCWs were excluded because of missing data, and 751 were included in the final analysis. The prevalences of PPE use were 22% (168/751) for optimized PPE use, 78% (583/751) for non-optimized PPE use, 35% (263/751) for PPE overuse, and 43% (320/751) for PPE underused. In univariate analysis, optimized PPE use was significantly associated with age, education level, knowledge of appropriate negative pressure room selection, and knowledge of apparently milder symptom severity in children than adults. In multivariate analysis, independent predictors of optimized PPE use were knowledge of appropriate negative pressure room selection (aOR = 1.95, 95% CI = 1.18-3.22), the difference in symptom severity between children and adults (aOR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.37-0.81), and education level (aOR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.04-2.27). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of optimized PPE use amongst HCWs was 22%. Independent predictors of optimized PPE use were COVID-19 knowledge-based factors and education level. Therefore, the continued education training program should be implemented to ensure maintenance of appropriate practices during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Moolasart, Visal; Manosuthi, Weerawat; Thienthong, Varaporn; Jaemsak, Uajai; Kongdejsakda, Winnada; Pantool, Pimonamorn; Chottanapund, Suthat",Environ Health Insights,281,6

Different models of reorganization have been described aiming to preserve resources while ensuring optimal medical care. limited clinical neurosurgical experience including COVID-19 patients have been reported. We share organizational experience, attitudes, and preliminary data of patients treated at our institution. Methods Institutional guidelines and patient workflow are described and visualized. A cohort of all neurosurgical patients managed during the lockdown period is presented and analyzed assessing suspected nosocomial infection risk factors. A comparative surgical subcohort from the previous year was used to investigate the impact on surgical activity. Results A total of 176 patients were admitted in 66 days, twenty tested positive for COVID-19. Patients initially admitted to the neurosurgical ward were less likely to be suspected for a COVID-19 infection when compared to patients admitted for critical emergencies, particularly with neurovascular and stroke-related pathologies. The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients was remarkably high (45%), and even higher in patients that underwent surgical intervention (77 %). In addition to the expected drop in surgical activity (-53%), a decrease in traumatic emergencies was noted. Conclusion By applying infection prevention and resource-sparing logistics measures shared by the international medical community, we were able to maintain essential neurosurgical care in a pandemic with controlled nosocomial infection risk. Special consideration should be given to medical management and surgical indications in patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as they seem to exhibit a problematic hemostatic profile that might result in an unfavorable clinical and surgical outcome.","LUBANSU, Alphonse; ASSAMADI, Mouhssine; BARRIT, Sami; DEMBOUR, Victoria; YAO, Gedeon; HADWE, Salim EL.; WITTE, Olivier DE.",World Neurosurg,281,28

We performed a systematic literature review to identify all treatments reported to be administered to COVID-19 patients and to assess time to clinically meaningful response for treatments with sufficient data. We searched PubMed, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and ChinaXiv for articles reporting treatments for COVID-19 patients published between 1 December 2019 and 27 March 2020. Data were analyzed descriptively. Of the 2706 articles identified, 155 studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 9152 patients. The cohort was 45.4% female and 98.3% hospitalized, and mean (SD) age was 44.4 years (SD 21.0). The most frequently administered drug classes were antivirals, antibiotics, and corticosteroids, and of the 115 reported drugs, the most frequently administered was combination lopinavir/ritonavir, which was associated with a time to clinically meaningful response (complete symptom resolution or hospital discharge) of 11.7 (1.09) days. There were insufficient data to compare across treatments. Many treatments have been administered to the first 9152 reported cases of COVID-19.

However, research pertaining to these effects within the afterschool setting remains limited. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the acute effects of a community-based afterschool running and reading program on executive functioning in 8 to 12-year-old children. Method: Fifty participants were initially recruited to participate in this study. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, data collection was terminated prematurely which resulted in a sample size of 15 participants. Participants (N = 10) from School 1 completed two batteries of executive function assessments (i.e., inhibition, switching, and updating) separated by 15-min of running or 15-min of sedentary reading. Whereas, only 5 participants from School 2 completed assessments of executive functioning prior to and following the running portion of the program (due to the early termination of data collection). Results: Overall, executive function scores improved across each assessment following the running condition when compared to the reading condition (School 1). Inhibition scores significantly improved, and these effects were very large (School 1). Across both schools, improvements in executive functioning following the running portion of the program ranged from small-large in effect size. Conclusion: Findings from the present study provide initial evidence for the acute effects of a community-based afterschool running and reading program on executive functioning in children.

However, the effects of L-arginine have never been evaluated in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted on patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19. Patients received 1.66 g L-arginine twice a day or placebo, administered orally. The primary efficacy endpoint was a reduction in respiratory support assessed 10 and 20 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes were the length of in-hospital stay, the time to normalization of lymphocyte number, and the time to obtain a negative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab. This clinical trial had been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT04637906. FINDINGS: We present here the results of the initial interim analysis on the first 101 patients. No treatment-emergent serious adverse events were attributable to L-arginine. At 10-day evaluation, 71.1% of patients in the L-arginine arm and 44.4% in the placebo arm (p < 0.01) had the respiratory support reduced; however, a significant difference was not detected 20 days after randomization. Strikingly, patients treated with L-arginine exhibited a significantly reduced in-hospital stay vs placebo, with a median (interquartile range 25(th),75(th) percentile) of 46 days (45,46) in the placebo group vs 25 days (21,26) in the L-arginine group (p < 0.0001); these findings were also confirmed after adjusting for potential confounders including age, duration of symptoms, comorbidities, D-dimer, as well as antiviral and anticoagulant treatments. The other secondary outcomes were not significantly different between groups. INTERPRETATION: In this interim analysis, adding oral L-arginine to standard therapy in patients with severe COVID-19 significantly decreases the length of hospitalization and reduces the respiratory support at 10 but not at 20 days after starting the treatment.","Fiorentino, Giuseppe; Coppola, Antonietta; Izzo, Raffaele; Annunziata, Anna; Bernardo, Mariano; Lombardi, Angela; Trimarco, Valentina; Santulli, Gaetano; Trimarco, Bruno",EClinicalMedicine,281,16

To that end, we evaluated a novel amphiphile (AMP) vaccine adjuvant, AMP-CpG, composed of diacyl lipid-modified CpG, admixed with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-2 receptor binding domain protein as a candidate vaccine (ELI-005) in mice. AMP immunogens are efficiently delivered to lymph nodes, where innate and adaptive immune responses are generated. Compared to alum, AMP immunization induced >25-fold higher antigen-specific T cells which produced multiple Th1 cytokines and trafficked into lung parenchyma and respiratory secretions. Antibody responses favored Th1 isotypes (IgG2bc, IgG3) and potently neutralized Spike-2-ACE2 receptor binding, with titers 265-fold higher than the natural immune response from convalescent COVID-19 patients; responses were maintained despite 10-fold dose-reduction in Spike antigen. Both cellular and humoral immune responses were preserved in aged mice. These advantages merit clinical translation to SARS-CoV-2 and other protein subunit vaccines.","Steinbuck, Martin P.; Seenappa, Lochana M.; Jakubowski, Aniela; McNeil, Lisa K.; Haqq, Christopher M.; DeMuth, Peter C.",bioRxiv,281,1

Cutaneous manifestations have been classified into 5 clinical patterns: acro-ischemic (pseudo-chilblain), vesicular, urticarial, maculopapular, and livedoid. Oral manifestations have also been reported, but much less frequently. Patients and Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study in which we examined the oral mucosa of 666 patients with COVID-19 at the IFEMA field hospital in Madrid in April 2020. Results: Seventy-eight patients (11.7%) had changes involving the oral mucosa. The most common were transient anterior U-shaped lingual papillitis (11.5%) accompanied or not by tongue swelling (6.6%), aphthous stomatitis (6.9%), a burning sensation in the mouth (5.3%), mucositis (3.9%), glossitis with patchy depapillation (3.9%), white tongue (1.6%), and enanthema (0.5%). Most of the patients also reported taste disturbances. Conclusions: COVID-19 also manifests in the oral cavity. The most common manifestations are transient U-shaped lingual papillitis, glossitis with patchy depapillation, and burning mouth syndrome. Mucositis with or without aphthous ulcers or enanthema may also be observed. Any these findings may be key clues to a diagnosis of COVID-19.","Nuño González, A.; Magaletsky, K.; Martín Carrillo, P.; Lozano Masdemont, B.; Mayor Ibarguren, A.; Feito Rodríguez, M.; Herranz Pinto, P.",Actas Dermosifiliogr,281,16

Many patients deteriorate rapidly and require intubation and mechanical ventilation, which is causing the collapse of healthcare systems in many countries. Coronavirus infection is associated with extensive lung inflammation and microvascular thrombosis, which can result in hypoxia. It can also cause severe and lasting harm in other organs, including the heart and kidneys. At present, there is no proven and efficacious treatment for this new disease. Consequently, there is a growing tendency to use novel methods. Ozone therapy consists of administration of a mixture of oxygen and ozone (a molecule consisting of 3 oxygen atoms). The potential benefits of this therapy include reduced tissue hypoxia, decreased hypercoagulability, renal and heart protection, modulated immune function, improved phagocytic function, and impaired viral replication. CASE REPORTS: We report rapidly improved hypoxia with associated decreases in inflammatory markers and D-dimer immediately after 1–4 sessions of oxygen–ozone (O(2)–O(3)) therapy in 3 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who presented with respiratory failure. Invasive mechanical ventilation was not required in these 3 patients. All patients were discharged home on days 3–4 after O(2)–O(3) therapy. CONCLUSIONS: O(2)–O(3) therapy appears to be an effective therapy for COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory failure. Large controlled clinical trials are required to study the efficacy and safety of using O(2)–O(3) therapy compared with the standard supportive case in patients with COVID-19 in terms of the need for invasive ventilation and length of hospital and intensive care unit stays.","Hernández, Alberto; Viñals, Montserrat; Isidoro, Tomas; Vilás, Francisco",Am J Case Rep,281,2

Subjects and Methods: We have quantified and analyzed one of the broadest set of clinical factors associated with COVID-19-related death, ranging from disease related co-morbities, socioeconomic factors, healthcare capacity and government policy and interventions. Data for population, total cases, total COVID mortality, tests done, and GDP per capita were extracted from the worldometers database. Datasets for health expenditure by government, hospital beds, rural population, prevalence of smoking, prevalence of overweight population, deaths due to communicable disease and incidence of malaria were extracted from the World Bank website. Prevalence of diabetes was retrieved from the indexmundi rankings. The average population age, 60+ population, delay in lockdown, population density and BCG data were also included for analysis. The COVID-19 mortality per million and its associated factors were retrieved for 56 countries across the globe. Quantitative analysis was done at the global as well as continent level. All the countries included in the study were categorized continent and region wise for comparative analysis determining the correlation between COVID 19 mortality and the aforementioned factors. Results: There was significant association found between mortality per million and 60+ population of country, average age, prevalence of diabetes mellitus, and case fatality rate with correlation and p value (p) of 0.422 (p 0.009), 0.386 (p 0.0186), -0.384 (p 0.019) and 0.753 (p 0.000) respectively at 95% CI.

A COVID-19 vaccine remains a critical element in the eventual solution to this public health crisis. Two vaccines are ready to be mass produced and eventually supplied to the population. Here, we develop an epidemiological network model able to represent COVID-19 pandemic dynamics of different countries such as in Italy. Stochastic computational simulations identify the necessary number of vaccines and vaccine efficacy thresholds capable of preventing an epidemic whilst adhering to lockdown guidelines. Assuming a vaccine efficacy of 100% in a mass vaccination program, at least 60% of a given population should be vaccinated to obtain herd immunity. Otherwise, new waves of COVID-19 would be reported. However, reaching 60% of the population will be an unprecedented mass immunisation campaign that will take several months and millions of dollars. If the vaccine efficacy reports lower levels of efficacy in practice, then the coverage of vaccination would be needed to be even higher. Simulations suggest that the ""Ring of Vaccination"" strategy, vaccinating susceptible contact and contact of contacts, would be a more tractable vaccine strategy to prevent the new waves of COVID -19 meanwhile a high percent of the population is vaccinated.","Tetteh, J.

Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.","Tong, Godwin; Groom, Kieran; Ward, Louisa; Naeem, Muhammad",Case Rep Psychiatry,281,16

The virus particularly targets the temporal lobe of the brain causing debilitating problems in memory, especially verbal memory. It is postulated that immunomodulation with the corticosteroid, dexamethasone, could improve outcomes by reducing brain swelling. However, there are concerns (so far not observed) that such immunosuppression might facilitate increased viral replication with resultant worsening of disease. A previous trail closed early because of slow recruitment. METHOD: DexEnceph is a pragmatic multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, observer-blind trial to determine whether adults with HSV encephalitis who receive dexamethasone alongside standard antiviral treatment with aciclovir for have improved clinical outcomes compared with those who receive standard treatment alone. Overall, 90 patients with HSV encephalitis are being recruited from a target of 45 recruiting sites; patients are randomised 1:1 to the dexamethasone or control arms of the study. The primary outcome measured is verbal memory as assessed by the Weschler Memory Scale fourth edition Auditory Memory Index at 26 weeks after randomisation. Secondary outcomes are measured up to 72 weeks include additional neuropsychological, clinical and functional outcomes as well as comparison of neuroimaging findings. Patient safety monitoring occurs throughout and includes the detection of HSV DNA in cerebrospinal fluid 2 weeks after randomisation, which is indicative of ongoing viral replication. Innovative methods are being used to ensure recrutiment targets are met for this rare disease. DISCUSSION: DexEnceph aims to be the first completed randomised controlled trial of corticosteroid therapy in HSV encephalitis. The results will provide evidence for future practice in managing adults with the condition and has the potential to improve outcomes .

PURPOSE: To investigate CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) findings of PTE in COVID-19 and its association with clinical and radiological conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study includes 109 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who underwent CTPA for suspected PTE from March 20 to May 3, 2020. Data were collected from our PACS. CTPA findings of PTE were evaluated. Based on the presence or absence of PTE, patients were divided in two groups and the clinical and radiological conditions were compared using Mann-Whitney U test and χ(2) test. RESULTS: Study population comprised 82M/19F, mean age 64.1±15.0 [95% confidence interval CI:60.4-67.6] years. CTPAs were performed 19.8±6.1 [95% CI:18.1-20.2] days after the symptom onset and 10.5±3.8 [95% CI:10.2-12.9] days after the admission. Patients with PTE were 41/101(40.6%). PTE was mostly bilateral or only right (37/41[90.2%]), mainly involved segmental (37/41[90.2%]) or subsegmental (25/41[61.0%]) arteries, and affected mainly the lower lobes branches (30/41[73.2%]). Parenchymal segments supplied by segmental arteries with PTE showed a prevalent consolidation pattern (25/37[67.6%]). Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was present only in 5/41(12.2%). Comparing groups with and without PTE, no significant difference was observed in age, gender, onset symptoms, comorbidities, tumor history, use of respiratory supports, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and DVT. Conversely, differences were evaluated in CT lesion score (15.7±1.4 [95% CI:15.3-16.1] vs 14.1±1.1 [95% CI:13.8-14.4], p=0.035); d-dimer (p<0.001); lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p<0.001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p=0.042). CONCLUSION: PTE in COVID-19 involves mainly the segmental and sub-segmental arteries of segments affected by consolidations in patients with more severe lung disease. We hypothesize that the development of PTE in COVID-19 might be a pulmonary artery thrombosis due to severe lung inflammation and hypercoagulability rather than thromboembolism.","Cavagna, Enrico; Muratore, Francesco; Ferrari, Fabio",Radiol Cardiothorac Imaging,281,29

A 29-question survey targeting patients with cancer was distributed electronically via cancer support organizations. Cross-sectional data from a selected weekday at a radiation oncology department were also analyzed. In addition, a 25-question survey was distributed to 168 physicians employed by a comprehensive cancer center. RESULTS: In total, we have analyzed 468 patients’ and 101 physicians’ responses. Among responding patients, 310 were undergoing active treatment and 158 were in follow-up care. Both patients and physicians reported no experiences with video consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic, but 15% of patients stated that they missed telemedicine services that would include a video call. Overall, 30.6% of patients expressed interest in more frequent usage of telemedicine and 23.3% would start using it. Sixty-seven percent of radiation oncologists expressed interest in more frequent usage of telemedicine, and 14% would use it similarly as in the past.

We present the perspectives of diverse, experienced mentors in a range of HIV research disciplines on the impact of COVID-19 on mentoring the next generation of HIV researchers. In November to December, 2020, we used an online data collection platform to cross-sectionally query previously-trained HIV mentors on the challenges related to mentoring during the pandemic, surprising/positive aspects of mentoring in that context, and recommendations for other mentors. Data were coded and analyzed following a thematic analysis approach. Respondents (180 of 225 mentors invited [80% response]) reported challenges related to relationship building/maintenance, disruptions in mentees’ training and research progress, and mentee and mentor distress, with particular concerns regarding mentees who are parents or from underrepresented minority backgrounds. Positive/surprising aspects included logistical ease of remote mentoring, the relationship-edifying result of the shared pandemic experience, mentee resilience and gratitude, and increased enjoyment of mentoring. Recommendations included practical tips, encouragement for patience and persistence, and prioritizing supporting mentees’ and one's own mental well-being. Findings revealed gaps in HIV mentors’ competencies, including the effective use of remote mentoring tools, how to work with mentees in times of distress, and the prioritization of mentor well-being.

The goal of this study was to predict the potential of 25 small molecule drugs in clinical trials for COVID‐19 to cause clinically relevant drug‐drug interactions (DDIs), which could lead to potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs) with the use of concomitant medications. We focused on 11 transporters, which are targets for DDIs. In vitro potency studies in membrane vesicles or HEK293 cells expressing the transporters coupled with DDI risk assessment methods revealed that 20 of the 25 drugs met the criteria from regulatory authorities to trigger consideration of a DDI clinical trial. Analyses of real‐world data from electronic health records, including a database representing nearly 120,000 patients with COVID‐19, were consistent with several of the drugs causing transporter‐mediated DDIs (e.g., sildenafil, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine). This study suggests that patients with COVID‐19, who are often older and on various concomitant medications, should be carefully monitored for ADRs.

Despite the importance of hantaviruses for public health, there is no consensus on their evolutionary history and especially the frequency of virus-host co-divergence versus cross-species virus transmission. Documenting the extent of hantavirus biodiversity, and particularly their range of mammalian hosts, is critical to resolving this issue. Here, we describe four novel hantaviruses (Huangpi virus, Lianghe virus, Longquan virus, and Yakeshi virus) sampled from bats and shrews in China, and which are distinct from other known hantaviruses. Huangpi virus was found in Pipistrellus abramus, Lianghe virus in Anourosorex squamipes, Longquan virus in Rhinolophus affinis, Rhinolophus sinicus, and Rhinolophus monoceros, and Yakeshi virus in Sorex isodon, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis of the available diversity of hantaviruses reveals the existence of four phylogroups that infect a range of mammalian hosts, as well as the occurrence of ancient reassortment events between the phylogroups. Notably, the phylogenetic histories of the viruses are not always congruent with those of their hosts, suggesting that cross-species transmission has played a major role during hantavirus evolution and at all taxonomic levels, although we also noted some evidence for virus-host co-divergence. Our phylogenetic analysis also suggests that hantaviruses might have first appeared in Chiroptera (bats) or Soricomorpha (moles and shrews), before emerging in rodent species. Overall, these data indicate that bats are likely to be important natural reservoir hosts of hantaviruses.","Guo, Wen-Ping; Lin, Xian-Dan; Wang, Wen; Tian, Jun-Hua; Cong, Mei-Li; Zhang, Hai-Lin; Wang, Miao-Ruo; Zhou, Run-Hong; Wang, Jian-Bo; Li, Ming-Hui; Xu, Jianguo; Holmes, Edward C.; Zhang, Yong-Zhen",PLoS Pathog,281,1

It is necessary to clarify the driving mechanism of green development to design the path of green development scientifically. From the internal perspective of the green development system, this paper divides the green development power into external power and internal power. The external power is the political pressure formed by the public’s green demands. The internal power is the endogenous power of green development transformed by the political promotion willingness of local government leaders. The research shows that (1) the green demands from the public and the accompanying political pressure can form the driving force of green development. (2) The political promotion intention has not been transformed into the endogenous driving force to promote green development in the research period. (3) The external driving force of public appeal is closely related to economic development, income and consumption levels, and education. This paper enriches the research literatures on the driving mechanism of green development and provides theoretical and practical exploration for the driving path of green development.","Li, Zhengda; Hou, Yihan; Cao, Junli; Ding, Yanping; Yuan, Xiaoling",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,281,1

Methods A questionnaire was circulated via social media to UK-based GDPs. The questionnaire examined GDPs' likelihood of issuing an inappropriate AB in two hypothetical clinical scenarios. Results A total of 205 questionnaires were completed, of which 198 were included for analysis. The resulting data were analysed to try and identify factors that correlated with an increased likelihood of an inappropriate AB prescription being issued for each clinical scenario. The results suggested the following factors as being associated with a statistically greater chance of the survey respondent issuing an inappropriate AB prescription: no postgraduate qualification; received their primary dental qualification from a non-UK university; scheduled appointments of less than 20 minutes; and low confidence in their ability to provide adequate local anaesthesia for the patients in the clinical scenario. Conclusions Four factors were shown to be associated with dentists' stated intention to prescribe ABs for acute dental pain, not in accordance with guidance. These results should guide further research to understand the significance of appropriate AB prescribing on the quality of urgent dental care. While the total number of respondents was too low to enable the results to be generalised, it is hoped that the results may help guide future research. Further studies could focus on these factors to understand more about their impact on the urgent care of adult patients in pain.

Demonstrated with good druggability, two major proteases of SARS-CoV-2, namely main protease (Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) that are essential for viral maturation, have become the targets for many newly designed inhibitors. Unlike Mpro that has been heavily investigated, PLpro is not well-studied so far. Here, we carried out the in silico high-throughput screening of all FDA-approved drugs via the flexible docking simulation for potential inhibitors of PLpro and explored the molecular mechanism of binding between a known inhibitor rac5c and PLpro. Our results, from molecular dynamics simulation, show that the chances of drug repurposing for PLpro might be low. On the other hand, our long (about 450 ns) MD simulation confirms that rac5c can be bound stably inside the substrate-binding site of PLpro and unveils the molecular mechanism of binding for the rac5c-PLpro complex. The latter may help perform further structural optimization and design potent leads for inhibiting PLpro.","Huynh, Tien; Cornell, Wendy; Luan, Binquan",Front Chem,281,26

We aim to shed more light on the clinical presentation of pediatric patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and also potential risk factors for more severe clinical case presentation. Methods We used a large global health research network to gather clinical data extracted from the electronic medical records of pediatric patients aged < 18 years with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 from January 1, 2020 to May 7, 2020. Clinical symptoms at presentation, hospitalization status, associated co-morbidities, and treatments received were reviewed. Results A total of 627 patients with COVID-19 diagnosis (334 were outpatient, 293 were inpatient) were included from a total of 20 organizations across the United States. The mean age of patients was seven years, 48% were females. Inpatients were younger than outpatients (mean age of 5.6 years vs 8.2 years, p<0.001). Sixty-one percent of patients in the inpatient group were < 5 years of age vs. 44% in the outpatient group. Amongst 293 inpatients, 90% (n=265) were non-severe and 10% (n=28) were classified as severe. The percentage of patients <5 years was higher in severe inpatients vs. non-severe (71% vs 60%.) Significantly more patients with a severe illness vs. non-severe illness had a history of co-morbidity including non-congenital heart disease (50% vs 11%, p<0.001) and disease of the respiratory system (86% vs 53%, p< 0.001). Conclusion Clinicians should closely monitor young children with underlying conditions and COVID-19, as they may be more likely to be hospitalized and have a higher severity of the disease.","Desai, Ankita; Mills, Alexandra; Delozier, Sarah; Cabrera Aviles, Claudia; Edwards, Amy; Dirajlal-Fargo, Sahera; McComsey, Grace",Cureus,281,1

METHODS: Data on 479 male participants within two shelters who completed questionnaires and a total of 950 nasal and pharyngeal samples were collected during the winters of 2015–2017. Respiratory pathogen carriage including seven viruses and four bacteria was assessed by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: The homeless population was characterized by a majority of individuals of North African origin (300/479, 62.6%) with a relatively high prevalence of chronic homelessness (175/465, 37.6%). We found a high prevalence of respiratory symptoms and signs (168/476, 35.3%), a very high prevalence of bacterial carriage (313/477, 65.6%), especially Haemophilus influenzae (280/477, 58.7%), and a lower prevalence of virus carriage (51/473, 10.8%) with human rhinovirus being the most frequent (25/473, 5.3%). Differences were observed between the microbial communities of the nose and throat. Duration of homelessness (odds ratio (OR) 1.77, p 0.017), chronic respiratory diseases (OR 5.27, p <0.0001) and visiting countries of origin for migrants (OR 1.68, p 0.035) were identified as independent risk factors for respiratory symptoms and signs. A strong association between virus (OR 2.40, p 0.012) or Streptococcus pneumoniae (OR 2.32, p 0.014) carriage and respiratory symptoms and signs was also found. CONCLUSIONS: These findings allowed identification of the individuals at higher risk for contracting respiratory tract infections to better target preventive measures aimed at limiting the transmission of these diseases in this setting.","Ly, T.D.A.; Edouard, S.; Badiaga, S.; Tissot-Dupont, H.; Hoang, V.T.; Pommier de Santi, V.; Brouqui, P.; Raoult, D.; Gautret, P.",Clin Microbiol Infect,281,1

We use city‐level export data at a monthly frequency from January 2018 through April 2020. Differences‐in‐differences estimates suggest cities in lockdown experienced a ceteris paribus 34 percentage points reduction in the year‐on‐year growth rate of exports. The lockdown impacted the intensive and extensive margin, with higher exit and lower new entry into foreign markets. The drop in exports was smaller in (i) coastal cities; (ii) cities with better‐developed ICT infrastructure; and (iii) cities with a larger share of potential teleworkers. Time‐sensitive and differentiated goods experienced a more pronounced decline in export growth. Global supply chain characteristics matter, with more upstream products and industries that had accumulated larger inventories experiencing a smaller decline in export growth. Also, products that relied more on imported (domestic) intermediates experienced a sharper (flatter) slowdown in export growth. The rapid recovery in cities' exports after lockdowns were lifted suggests the policy was cost‐effective in terms of its effects on trade.","Pei, Jiansuo; de Vries, Gaaitzen; Zhang, Meng",J Reg Sci,281,26

The work outlined in this study addresses the interconnectedness of independent variables (e.g., UV Fluence, respirator material) that require consideration when assessing UV light efficacy for disinfecting respirators. Through electron microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, we characterized respirator filter layers and revealed that polymer type affects disinfection efficacy. Specifically, FFR layers made from polypropylene (PP) (hydrophobic in nature) resulted in higher disinfection efficiency than layers composed of polyethylene terephthalate (PET-P) (hygroscopic in nature). An analysis of elastic band materials on the respirators indicated that silicone rubber-based bands achieved higher disinfection efficiency than PET-P bands and have a woven, fabric-like texture. While there is a strong desire to repurpose respirators, through this work we demonstrated that the design of an appropriate UV system is essential and that only respirators meeting specific design criteria may be reasonable for repurposing via UV disinfection.","Ontiveros, C.

A nationwide snapshot of the management of HPB minimally invasive surgery activity during COVID-19 pandemic is provided: a survey was developed and conducted within AICEP (Italian Association of HepatoBilioPancreatic Surgeons) with the final aim of conveying the experience, knowledge, and opinions into a unitary report enabling more efficient crisis management. Results from the survey (81 respondents) show that, in Italian hospitals, minimally invasive surgery maintains its role despite the COVID-19 pandemic, with the registered reduction of cases being proportional to the overall reduction of the HPB surgical activity. Respondents agree that the switch from minimally invasive to open technique can be considered as a valid option for cases with a high technical complexity. Several issues merit specific attention: screening for virus positivity should be universally performed; only expert surgical teams should operate on positive patients and specific technical measures to lower the biological risk of contamination during surgery must be followed.

The purpose of the study is to identify the critical factors that affect the global sustainable supply chain process in the cross-sectional panel of 38 European countries, 14 North American countries, 40 Asian countries, and a heterogeneous panel of 111 countries. The results show that an increase in susceptible coronavirus cases and death tolls limits the supply chain process because of nationwide closures of industries and business activities. In contrast, an increase in the number of recovered cases supports economic activities and improved logistic performance index across countries. The innovation accounting matrix shows that since August 2020, the global coronavirus cases will decline and start resuming economic activities to increase the supply chain process. The result is further supported by the estimates of reduction in the proportion of death to recovered cases (case fatality ratio 1) to increase sustainable logistics activities. However, the supply chain process could affect an increasing death toll and case fatality ratio 2 (i.e., the proportion of death to registered cases) over time. The global economies should ensure a free flow of sustainable logistics supply, especially the supply of healthcare medical equipment that would help control the coronavirus pandemic, which escapes from the nations from a global depression.","Anser, Muhammad Khalid; Khan, Muhammad Azhar; Nassani, Abdelmohsen A.; Abro, Muhammad Moinuddin Qazi; Zaman, Khalid; Kabbani, Ahmad",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,281,3

Fusarium mold is a major plant pathogen and produces a number of trichothecene mycotoxins including deoxynivalenol (or vomitoxin), nivalenol, diacetoxyscirpenol, and T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin. Monogastrics are sensitive to vomitoxin, while poultry and ruminants appear to be less sensitive to some trichothecenes through microbial metabolism of trichothecenes in the gastrointestinal tract. Trichothecene mycotoxins occur worldwide however both total concentrations and the particular mix of toxins present vary with environmental conditions. Proper agricultural practices such as avoiding late harvests, removing overwintered stubble from fields, and avoiding a corn/wheat rotation that favors Fusarium growth in residue can reduce trichothecene contamination of grains. Due to the vague nature of toxic effects attributed to low concentrations of trichothecenes, a solid link between low level exposure and a specific trichothecene is difficult to establish. Multiple factors, such as nutrition, management, and environmental conditions impact animal health and need to be evaluated with the knowledge of the mycotoxin and concentrations known to cause adverse health effects. Future research evaluating the impact of low-level exposure on livestock may clarify the potential impact on immunity. Trichothecenes are rapidly excreted from animals, and residues in edible tissues, milk, or eggs are likely negligible. In chronic exposures to trichothecenes, once the contaminated feed is removed and exposure stopped, animals generally have an excellent prognosis for recovery. This review shows the occurrence of trichothecenes in food and feed in 2011–2020 and their toxic effects and provides a summary of the discussions on the potential public health concerns specifically related to trichothecenes residues in foods associated with the exposure of farm animals to mycotoxin-contaminated feeds and impact to human health.
