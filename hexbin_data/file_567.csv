However, the effect of statin use on HCC recurrence is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of statin use on recurrence after curative resection among patients with HCC. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 820 patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0 or A HCC who underwent primary resection between January 2001 and June 2016 at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Exposure to statins was defined as use of a statin for at least 3 months before HCC recurrence. Factors that influenced overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Of the 820 patients, 46 (5.6%) used statins (statin group) and 774 (94.4%) did not (non-statin group). During the mean follow-up of 76.5 months, 440 (53.7%) patients experienced recurrence and 146 (17.8%) patients died. The cumulative incidence of HCC recurrence was significantly lower in the statin group than the non-statin group (p = 0.001); OS was not significantly different between groups. In multivariate analysis, age (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.291; p = 0.010), liver cirrhosis (HR: 1.743; p < 0.001), diabetes (HR:1.418; p = 0.001), number of tumors (HR: 1.750; p < 0.001), tumor size (HR: 1.406; p = 0.004) and vascular invasion (HR: 1.659; p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for HCC recurrence, whereas statin use (HR: 0.354; p < 0.001) and antiviral therapy (HR: 0.613; p < 0.001) significantly reduced the risk of HCC recurrence. The statin group still had lower RFS than the non-statin group after one-to-four propensity score matching. CONCLUSION: Statins may exert a chemo-preventive effect on HCC recurrence after curative resection.

I begin by outlining the standard Aristotelian view of friendship, according to which there are certain necessary conditions which x must meet in order to ‘be a friend’. I explain how the current literature typically uses this Aristotelian view to object to human–robot friendships on theoretical and ethical grounds. Theoretically, a robot cannot be our friend because it cannot meet the requisite necessary conditions for friendship. Ethically, human–robot friendships are wrong because they are deceptive (the robot does not actually meet the conditions for being a friend), and could also make it more likely that we will favour ‘perfect’ robots, and disrespect, exploit, or exclude other human beings. To argue against the above position, I begin by outlining and assessing current attempts to reject the theoretical argument—that we cannot befriend robots. I argue that the current attempts are problematic, and do little to support the claim that we can be friends with robots now (rather than in some future time). I then use the standard Aristotelian view as a touchstone to develop a new degrees-of-friendship view. On my view, it is theoretically possible for humans to have some degree of friendship with social robots now. I explain how my view avoids ethical concerns about human–robot friendships being deceptive, and/or leading to the disrespect, exploitation, or exclusion of other human beings.","Ryland, Helen",Minds Mach (Dordr),567,15

During the modeling process, it is expected that the disease spreads only due to get in touch with the susceptible and infected class only. It is also assumed that due to the effect of vaccination, the total human population forms a separate class and avoids contact with the infection. The dynamical behaviors of the system have been explored by using the stability theory of differential equations and numerical simulations. The local and global stability of the system for both equilibrium states under certain conditions has been studied. We have set up a threshold condition in the language of the vaccine-induced reproduction number [Formula: see text] , which is fewer than unity, the disease dies in the absence of the infected population, otherwise, the infection remains in the population. Furthermore, it is found that vaccine coverage has a substantial effect on the basic reproduction number. Also, by continuous efforts and effectiveness of vaccine coverage, the disease can be eradicated. It is also found a more sensitive parameter for the transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus by using sensitivity analysis. In addition, numerical results are used to investigate the effect of some parameters happening the control of JE infection, for justification of analytical results.","Baniya, Vinod; Keval, Ram",J Appl Math Comput,567,15

First of all, a decreasing chemotaxis step combined with sine function (BFO-SDC) takes the place of constant chemotaxis step size. It is a nonlinear decreasing strategy at every iteration of the algorithm. And then, the variance is replaced by semivariance and skewness is taken into account in order to generate asymmetry of return distributions to overcome the inadequacy of the standard mean-variance model. Finally, fuzzy variables are used to express the uncertain and imprecise elements in the decision-making process. The results of the simulation show that the model can be solved more reasonably and effectively by BFO-SDC than the original bacterial foraging optimization.","Wu, Xinzheng; Gao, Aiqing; Huang, Xin",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,567,1

We have also observed other mutations in the s2m motif commonly reported in COVID‐19 patients in positions previously thought to be invariant. To better understand dimerization in the s2m region we used molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the folding of the mutant as monomers. Using AmberTools and NAMD, systems for the sequences were created, minimized, equilibrated, and then submitted for production.

Ethnicity is known to influence the response to antihypertensives, especially in black populations living in North America and Europe. We sought to outline the impact of all commonly used pharmacological agents on both blood pressure reduction and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in SSA. METHODS We used similar criteria to previous large meta-analyses of blood pressure agents but restricted results to populations in SSA. Quality of evidence was assessed using a risk of bias tool. Network meta-analysis with random effects was used to compare the effects across interventions and meta-regression to explore participant heterogeneity. RESULTS Thirty-two studies of 2860 participants were identified. Most were small studies from single, urban centres. Compared with placebo, any pharmacotherapy lowered SBP/DBP by 8.51/8.04 mmHg, and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were the most efficacious first-line agent with 18.46/11.6 mmHg reduction. Fewer studies assessing combination therapy were available, but there was a trend towards superiority for CCBs plus ACE inhibitors or diuretics compared to other combinations. No studies examined the effect of antihypertensive therapy on morbidity or mortality outcomes. CONCLUSION Evidence broadly supports current guidelines and provides a clear rationale for promoting CCBs as first-line agents and early initiation of combination therapy. However, there is a clear requirement for more evidence to provide a nuanced understanding of stroke and other cardiovascular disease prevention amongst diverse populations on the continent.

To achieve negative margins, reducing the difficulty and risks of the procedure are major goals for us. The marker meeting approach we reported can help to accomplish this goal. The key technique for the marker meeting approach is to ensure a clear distal margin in a low resection of the rectum by transanal dissection. This procedure allows access to the space around the distal rectum and mesorectum and to pack the gauzes in the distal part of the space as a landmark. Routine laparoscopic LAR was performed to dissect the space until reaching the gauzes packed above and achieve complete mobilization of the rectum and mesorectum. This surgical procedure is simpler and reduces the difficulty of the operation. Therefore, it is expected to reduce the risk of surgery-related complications and positive margins and is suitable to be widely applied and extended in clinical practice. The short-term and long-term clinical outcomes of the marker meeting approach need more research in large samples.","Yang, Xuefei; Zhang, Guixi; Jiang, Li; Zhang, Hao; Liu, Zhihai; Liu, Jingsi; Deng, Yang; Pan, Kai; Man Fan, Joe King",Annals of translational medicine,567,1

We have identified an influenza A virus from little yellow-shouldered bats captured at two locations in Guatemala. It is significantly divergent from known influenza A viruses. The HA of the bat virus was estimated to have diverged at roughly the same time as the known subtypes of HA and was designated as H17. The neuraminidase (NA) gene is highly divergent from all known influenza NAs, and the internal genes from the bat virus diverged from those of known influenza A viruses before the estimated divergence of the known influenza A internal gene lineages. Attempts to propagate this virus in cell cultures and chicken embryos were unsuccessful, suggesting distinct requirements compared with known influenza viruses. Despite its divergence from known influenza A viruses, the bat virus is compatible for genetic exchange with human influenza viruses in human cells, suggesting the potential capability for reassortment and contributions to new pandemic or panzootic influenza A viruses.","Tong, Suxiang; Li, Yan; Rivailler, Pierre; Conrardy, Christina; Castillo, Danilo A Alvarez; Chen, Li-Mei; Recuenco, Sergio; Ellison, James A; Davis, Charles T; York, Ian A; Turmelle, Amy S; Moran, David; Rogers, Shannon; Shi, Mang; Tao, Ying; Weil, Michael R; Tang, Kevin; Rowe, Lori A; Sammons, Scott; Xu, Xiyan; Frace, Michael; Lindblade, Kim A; Cox, Nancy J; Anderson, Larry J; Rupprecht, Charles E; Donis, Ruben O",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,567,1

A complementary approach has been to adopt the concept of biomimicry of natural products and metabolites so as to improve multiple drug-like features of the parent molecule. In this effort, promiscuous and weak interactions between ligands and receptors are often ignored in a drug discovery process. In this emerging concepts' article, we highlight microbial metabolite mimicry, whereby parent metabolites have weak interactions with their receptors, that then have led to discrete examples of more potent and effective drug-like molecules. We show specific examples of parent metabolite mimics with potent effects in vitro and in vivo. Further we show examples of emerging microbial ligand-receptor interactions and provide a context in which these ligands could be improved as potential drugs. A balanced conceptual advance is provided in which we also acknowledge potential pitfalls - hyperstimulation of finely balanced receptor-ligand interactions could also be detrimental. However, on balance, we provide examples of where this emerging concept needs to be tested. Significance Statement The concept of microbial metabolite mimicry as a means to expand drug repertoires is new. Hitherto, there are very few proof-of-concept papers demonstrating utility of this concept. More recently, papers demonstrating mimicry of intestinal microbial metabolites could potentially expand the drug repertoire for diseases such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease. We opine that as more functional metabolite-receptor pairings are discovered, small molecular mimicry could be a significant effort in drug discovery.","Dvorak, Zdenek; Klapholz, Max; Burris, Thomas P; Willing, Benjamin P; Gioiello, Antimo; Pellicciari, Roberto; Galli, Francesco; March, John; Sartor, Ryan B; Kim, Chang; Levy, Maayan; Mani, Sridhar; O'Keefe, Stephen J",Molecular pharmacology,567,5

Since inflammation is associated with hypercoagulability and thrombosis, our goal was to compare the temporal inflammatory profile following hemorrhagic shock in patients with and without VTE. STUDY DESIGN Secondary analysis was performed on data collected from PROPPR. Blood samples collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours following admission were assayed on a 27-target cytokine panel, and compared between VTE (n=83) and non-VTE (n=475) patients. p<0.05 indicated significance. RESULTS Over time, both groups exhibited elevations in pro-inflammatory mediators interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, granulocyte colony-stimulating (G-CSF) 57, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1β, and anti-inflammatory mediators IL-1ra and IL-10 (P<0.05 vs admission). VTE patients showed amplified responses for IL-6 (6-72 hours) and IL-8 (6-24 hours), which peaked at later time points, and GCSF-57 (12-24 hours), MCP-1 (6-72 hours), and MIP-1β (2-12 hours) (P<0.05 vs non-VTE per time point) that peaked at similar time points to non-VTE patients. The anti-inflammatory responses were similar between groups, but the interleukin-mediated pro-inflammatory responses continued to rise after the peak anti-inflammatory response in the VTE group. The occurrence rate of adverse events was higher in VTE (97%) versus non-VTE (87%, p=0.009) and was associated with higher inflammation. CONCLUSION Patients with VTE following hemorrhagic shock exhibited a prolonged and amplified pro-inflammatory responses mediated by select interleukin, chemotactic, and glycoprotein cytokines that are not antagonized by anti-inflammatory mediators. This response is not related to randomization group, injury severity or degree of shock, but may be linked to adverse events.

Although EBOV is considered a public health concern, there is a relative paucity of information regarding the modulation of the functional host response during infection. We employed temporal kinome analysis to investigate the relative early, intermediate, and late host kinome responses to EBOV infection in human hepatocytes. Pathway overrepresentation analysis and functional network analysis of kinome data revealed that transforming growth factor (TGF-β)-mediated signaling responses were temporally modulated in response to EBOV infection. Upregulation of TGF-β signaling in the kinome data sets correlated with the upregulation of TGF-β secretion from EBOV-infected cells. Kinase inhibitors targeting TGF-β signaling, or additional cell receptors and downstream signaling pathway intermediates identified from our kinome analysis, also inhibited EBOV replication. Further, the inhibition of select cell signaling intermediates identified from our kinome analysis provided partial protection in a lethal model of EBOV infection. To gain perspective on the cellular consequence of TGF-β signaling modulation during EBOV infection, we assessed cellular markers associated with upregulation of TGF-β signaling. We observed upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9, N-cadherin, and fibronectin expression with concomitant reductions in the expression of E-cadherin and claudin-1, responses that are standard characteristics of an epithelium-to-mesenchyme-like transition. Additionally, we identified phosphorylation events downstream of TGF-β that may contribute to this process. From these observations, we propose a model for a broader role of TGF-β-mediated signaling responses in the pathogenesis of Ebola virus disease. IMPORTANCE Ebola virus (EBOV), formerly Zaire ebolavirus, causes a severe hemorrhagic disease in humans and nonhuman primates and is the most lethal Ebola virus species, with case fatality rates of up to 90%. Although EBOV is considered a worldwide concern, many questions remain regarding EBOV molecular pathogenesis. As it is appreciated that many cellular processes are regulated through kinase-mediated phosphorylation events, we employed temporal kinome analysis to investigate the functional responses of human hepatocytes to EBOV infection. Administration of kinase inhibitors targeting signaling pathway intermediates identified in our kinome analysis inhibited viral replication in vitro and reduced EBOV pathogenesis in vivo. Further analysis of our data also demonstrated that EBOV infection modulated TGF-β-mediated signaling responses and promoted ""mesenchyme-like"" phenotypic changes. Taken together, these results demonstrated that EBOV infection specifically modulates TGF-β-mediated signaling responses in epithelial cells and may have broader implications in EBOV pathogenesis.","Kindrachuk, Jason; Wahl-Jensen, Victoria; Safronetz, David; Trost, Brett; Hoenen, Thomas; Arsenault, Ryan; Feldmann, Friederike; Traynor, Dawn; Postnikova, Elena; Kusalik, Anthony; Napper, Scott; Blaney, Joseph E; Feldmann, Heinz; Jahrling, Peter B",Journal of virology,567,23

The presence of uncontrolled chronic obesity-related comorbidities, particularly pulmonary diseases, can present a primary fertile soil for respiratory tract infection. Combined with immune system impairments, such as alteration in the T-cell proliferation and macrophage differentiation, and the high pro-inflammatory cytokine production by the adipose organ, this may worsen the general condition toward a systemic diffusion of infection. Prevention remains the first line of intervention in these patients that can be achieved by adhering to social distancing and adopting hygiene precautions, combined with a healthy lifestyle. Patients with obesity require preferential access dedicated to primary care services to ensure they are regularly taking their medications for the treatment of any concurrent chronic diseases. Finally, their physicians must promptly manage any medical signs or symptoms in the case of suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) infection to prevent the risk of severe outcomes.","Valerio, Alessandra; Nisoli, Enzo; Rossi, Andrea P; Pellegrini, Massimo; Todesco, Tiziana; Ghoch, Marwan El",Journal of population therapeutics and clinical pharmacology = Journal de la therapeutique des populations et de la pharmacologie clinique,567,10

MAIN TEXT We searched five electronic databases. We included case-control, cross-sectional and cohort studies that included a headache and back pain free group, reporting on any association between persistent LBP and primary headache disorders. Methodological quality was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Our primary outcome was the association between primary headache disorders and persistent LBP. Our secondary outcomes were any associations between severity of LBP and severity of headache, and the relationship between specific headache sub-types classified as per International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria and persistent LBP. We included 14 studies. The sizes of the studies ranged from 88 participants to a large international study with 404, 206 participants. Odds ratios for the association were between 1.55 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-2.11) and 8.00 (95% CI 5.3-12.1). Study heterogeneity meant statistical pooling was not possible. Only two studies presented data investigating persistent LBP and chronic headache disorders in accordance with ICDH criteria. CONCLUSIONS We identified a positive association between persistent LBP and primary headache disorders. The quality of the review findings is limited by diversity of populations, study designs and uncertainly about headache and LBP definitions.

Lack of diversity has a negative effect on patient care and on the culture of our health care system. This study reports the current status of ethnically UIM physicians in the plastic surgery pipeline, starting from the medical student level and progressing to national leadership positions. METHODS The Electronic Residency Applications Service, National Resident Matching Program, Association of American Medical Colleges, and professional Web sites for journals and national societies were accessed for racial demographic information from 2008 to 2019. RESULTS Over the past decade, there has been no change or a slight decrease in representation of Blacks among plastic surgery residency applicants, trainees, and academic faculty, at half or less than expected, compared with US Census data. The first point of drop-off occurs at the resident (3.8% of integrated and 5.6% of independent residents) to faculty level (<2.8%). Two percent of program directors and department heads/division chiefs are Black. The next point of drop-off occurs at the national level: there has never been a Black president of American Society of Plastic Surgeons or Plastic Surgery Foundation, and there are no Black editors-in-chiefs of major plastic surgery journals.Following LatinX American surgeons down the pipeline over the past decade, there has been no change or a decrease in representation among plastic surgery residency applicants, resident physicians, and academic faculty, at one-third or less than expected, compared with US Census data. The first point of drop-off occurs at the faculty (4.8%) to local leadership level (0% of program directors and department heads/division chiefs) where there is no representation of LatinX. Once this drop-off occurs, there is no recovery at the national leadership level. CONCLUSIONS In order for our profession to reflect our nation's demographics, academic plastic surgery is in need of a paradigm shift now. Attrition of UIM physicians in plastic surgery begins at medical school graduation and persists through surgical training, faculty appointments, and attainment of leadership positions.

Methods: We used Hospital Episode Statistics to identify all people alive 01 March 2020 with ICD10 codes for RAIRD from the whole population of England. We used linked national health records (demographic, death certificate, admissions and PCR testing data) to calculate rates of COVID19 infection and death up to 31 July 2020. Our primary definition of COVID19 related death was mention of COVID19 on the death certificate. General population data from Public Health England and the Office for National Statistics were used for comparison. We also describe COVID19 related hospital admissions and all cause deaths. Results: We identified a cohort of 168,680 people with RAIRD, of whom 1874 (1.11%) had a positive COVID19 PCR test. The age standardised infection rate was 1.54 (95% CI 1.50, 1.59) times higher than in the general population. 713 (0.42%) people with RAIRD died with COVID19 on their death certificate and the age sex standardised mortality rate for COVID19 related death was 2.41 (2.30, 2.53) times higher than in the general population. There was no evidence of an increase in deaths from other causes in the RAIRD population. Conclusions: During the first wave of COVID19 in England, people with RAIRD had a 54% increased risk of COVID19 infection and more than twice the risk of COVID19 related death compared to the general population. These increases were seen despite shielding policies.","Rutter, M.; Lanyon, P. C.; Grainge, M. J.; Hubbard, R.; Peach, E.; Bythell, M.; Stilwell, P.; Ashton, J.; Stevens, S.; Pearce, F. A.",,567,1

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has not been widely adopted, but may have radiobiologic advantages over more conventionally fractionated treatments. We hypothesized that radiotherapy dose-escalation with SBRT (35-40Gy in ≤5 fractions) is associated with improved overall survival (OS) relative to biologically equivalent doses of CFRT (72-86.4Gy in 1.8-2.0Gy/fraction) or MFRT (≥60Gy in 2.4- 3.2Gy/fraction) ± ADT. Methods: The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used to identify 28,028 men with UIR prostate cancer who received CFRT with (n = 12,872) or without ADT (n = 12,984), MFRT with (n = 251) or without ADT (n = 281), and SBRT with (n = 212) or without ADT (n = 1,428). SBRT+ADT patients were excluded due to low patient numbers. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to balance measured confounders. Unweighted and weighted- multivariable analysis (MVA) using Cox regression was used to compare OS hazard ratios. Results: Relative to CFRT without ADT, CFRT+ADT (Hazard Ratio (HR): 0.92, [95% Confidence Interval: 0.87-0.97], P = .002) and SBRT without ADT (HR: 0.74 [0.61-0.89], P = .002) were both associated with improved OS on MVA. Relative to CFRT+ADT, SBRT without ADT correlated with improved OS on MVA (HR: 0.81 [0.67-0.99], P = .04). Weight-adjusted MVA demonstrated that SBRT (HR: 0.80 [0.65-0.98], P = .036) and ADT (HR: 0.91 [0.86-0.97], P = .002) correlated with improved OS. SBRT was not associated with improved OS relative to MFRT. Conclusions: Using inverse propensity treatment weighting, we adjusted for age, comorbidity score, and tumor factors, and observed a significant overall survival benefit in favor of administering dose-escalated SBRT over CFRT+ADT. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that SBRT is associated with improved OS relative to CFRT for men with UIR prostate cancer. Together, this suggests that SBRT offers a cheaper and shorter course of therapy that mitigates COVID-19 exposure, which also is associated with improved OS relative to CFRT for UIR prostate cancer and may obviate the need for ADT in this population. While we await results from several ongoing clinical trials, we believe this study lends support to the use of SBRT in men with UIR prostate cancer.","Andruska, N.; Fischer-Valuck, B.

Traditionally, researchers use pre-trained models to solve these problems, however, pre-trained models typically have a huge number of trainable parameters. Small datasets are challenging for them to train a model adequately and imbalanced datasets easily lead to overfitting on the classes with more samples. Multiple-stream networks that learn a variety of features have recently gained popularity. Therefore, in this work, a quad-stream hybrid model called QuadSNet using conventional as well as separable convolutional neural networks is proposed to achieve better performance on small and imbalanced datasets without using any pre-trained model. The designed model extracts hybrid features and the fusion of such features makes the model more robust on heterogeneous data. Besides, a weighted margin loss is used to handle the problem of class imbalance. The QuadSNet is trained and tested on seven different classification datasets. To evaluate the advantages of QuadSNet on small and massively imbalanced data, it is compared with six state-of-the-art pre-trained models on three benchmark datasets based on Pneumonia, COVID-19, and Cancer classification. To assess the performance of QuadSNet on general classification datasets, it is compareed with the best model on each of the remaining four datasets, which contain larger, balanced, grayscale, color or non-medical image data. The results show that QuadSNet handles the class imbalance and overfitting better than existing pre-trained models with much fewer parameters on small datasets. Meanwhile, QuadSNet has competitive performance in general datasets. © 2021.

Endoscopy can generate aerosols because of coughing or retching and it has demonstrated that COVID-19 virus can remain viable in aerosols for hours.2 An experimental study using transparent aerosol box for endotracheal intubation demonstrated that simulated cough caused contamination of only inner surface of box and operator’s gloves and gowned forearms whereas without aerosol box simulated cough resulted in widespread contamination.3 Using similar analogy, EBOX designed by authors also resulted in limited contamination during endoscopy especially of key areas such as exposed neck of the endoscopist. The experimental study by Canelli et al generated more droplets as compared with aerosols and their method of detection could not identify small quantities of infectious material.3 Therefore, these protective enclosures are not a replacement for standard protective precautions but an adjunct to standard protective equipment and practices.4 Also, ERCP is an advanced procedure that involves lot of dexterity and unrestricted movements of duodenoscope.

During the COVID-19 emergency most students' educational experience moved from face-To-face physical classroom to web-based environments which exposed disparities in students' digital resources and competence and placed greater attention on the need to address these inequalities. Digital competence is typically measured in terms of an individual's ability to use digital technology to achieve their work, study or personal objectives. Being digitally competent is significant with regard to an individual being able to achieve things that they value, but is only part of an overall evaluation of their digital capability. This paper argues that in addition to competence, assessment of digital capability should include an evaluation of a person's access to technology as well as their attitudes towards its value in achieving their goals. This paper is a work in progress exploring findings derived from research evaluating strategies to improve staff capability and confidence in using online learning technologies at eight FE colleges in the south east of England. In this research students undertook surveys that included self-Assessment of their digital competences following the DigComp model, information on their use of digital devices and home network reliability, and evaluated their enjoyment of and confidence in using online learning technologies. This current paper explores the outcomes from these surveys. Evaluation of survey data revealed a significant digital divide between those who had access to suitable devices and reliable network connections and those who did not. Results show significant associations between students' access to the technology they need to take part in online lessons, their self-Assessed competence, and their capability to fully engage with and satisfaction with online learning.

However, no universally accepted set of criteria for tracking the progress of urban sustainable transportation projects currently exists;one reason for this is the absence of a standardized lexicon for sustainability measurement elements. Therefore, this paper conducts a systematic literature review and analysis of sustainable transportation criteria using 21 papers from journals listed in the German rating system JOURQUAL3 (JQ3) and published between 2010 and 2020. The paper thus develops a unified vocabulary for sustainability measurement elements that is structured into a hierarchy. The goal (sustainable transportation) presides over the following three sustainability dimensions: objectives (e.g., minimization of traffic clogging), criteria (e.g., congestion), and indicators (e.g., cost of traffic congestion). Within the hierarchy, the main criteria for urban multimodal sustainable transportation are identified as follows: 13 social, 11 economic, and 9 environmental main criteria are determined. The three main criteria used most in the literature exclusively concern the environment. Future research is recommended to assess the interrelations between the criteria as their assignment to sustainability dimensions is ambiguous in the existing literature.

The RNA secondary structure is a functional characteristic of RNA viruses, and together with the accumulated high-throughput sequencing data could provide general insights towards understanding virus biology. Here, we profiled the RNA secondary structure of >7500 complete viral genomes from 11 different species of viral hemorrhagic fevers, including dengue serotypes, ebola, and yellow fever. Results We achieved hig prediction scores (AUC up to 0.85 with experimental data), and computed consensus secondary structure profiles using hundreds of structural in silico models. We observed that virulent viruses such as DENV-2 and ebola tend to be less structured than the other viruses. Furthermore, we observed virus-specific correlations between secondary structure and the number of interaction sites with human proteins, reaching a correlation of 0.89 in the case of zika. We demonstrate that the secondary structure and presence of protein-binding domains in the genomes can be used as intrinsic signature to further classify the viruses. We also used structural data to study the geographical distribution of dengue, finding a significant difference between DENV-3 from Asia and South-America, which could imply different evolutionary routes of this subtype. Conclusions Our massive computational analysis provided novel results regarding the secondary structure and the interaction with human proteins, not only for Dengue serotypes, but also for other viral hemorrhagic fevers. We also provided a new approach to classify viruses according ot their structure, which could be useful for future cassifications.

Recent high-resolution X-ray crystal structures present the first opportunity to see how the adamantyl-amine class of inhibitors bind to M2 and disrupt and interact with the channel’s water network, providing insight into the critical properties that enable their effective inhibition in wildtype M2. In this work, we test the hypothesis that these drugs act primarily as mechanism-based inhibitors by comparing hydrated excess proton stabilization during proton transport in M2 with the interactions revealed in the crystal structures, using the Multiscale Reactive Molecular Dynamics (MS-RMD) methodology. MS-RMD, unlike classical molecular dynamics, models the hydrated proton (hydronium-like cation) as a dynamic excess charge defect and allows bonds to break and form, capturing the intricate interactions between the hydrated excess proton, protein atoms, and water. Through this, we show that the ammonium group of the inhibitors is effectively positioned to take advantage of the channel’s natural ability to stabilize an excess protonic charge and is thus acting as a hydronium-mimic. Additionally, we show that the channel is especially stable in the drug binding region, highlighting the importance of this property for binding the adamantane group. Finally, we characterize an additional hinge point near Val27, which dynamically responds to charge and inhibitor binding. Altogether, this work further illuminates a dynamic understanding of the mechanism of drug inhibition in M2, grounded in the fundamental properties that enable the channel to transport and stabilize excess protons, with critical implications for future drug design efforts.

One function of the enzyme is to process viral polyproteins. The active form of the SARS CoV main proteinase is a homodimer. In the literature, estimates of the monomer-dimer equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, have varied more than 65,0000-fold, from <1 nM to more than 200 microM. Because of these discrepancies and because compounds that interfere with activation of the enzyme by dimerization may be potential antiviral agents, we investigated the monomer-dimer equilibrium by three different techniques: small-angle X-ray scattering, chemical cross-linking, and enzyme kinetics. Analysis of small-angle X-ray scattering data from a series of measurements at different SARS CoV main proteinase concentrations yielded KD values of 5.8 +/- 0.8 microM (obtained from the entire scattering curve), 6.5 +/- 2.2 microM (obtained from the radii of gyration), and 6.8 +/- 1.5 microM (obtained from the forward scattering). The KD from chemical cross-linking was 12.7 +/- 1.1 microM, and from enzyme kinetics, it was 5.2 +/- 0.4 microM. While each of these three techniques can present different, potential limitations, they all yielded similar KD values.","Graziano, Vito; McGrath, William J; Yang, Lin; Mangel, Walter F",Biochemistry,567,19

The available methods for the rapid detection of RSV by antigen detection or PCR either lack sensitivity, require complex laboratory manipulation, or have not been evaluated in this patient population. To assess the applicability of a TaqMan-based real-time PCR technique for the detection of RSV A and B in immunocompromised adults, we developed a rapid, sensitive detection method that simultaneously detects RSV A and B and can be applied in routine diagnostics. The specificity of the assay was assessed using a panel of reference strains of other respiratory viruses and RSV. Electron microscopy-counted stocks of RSV A and B were used to develop a quantitative PCR format. Eleven copies of viral RNA could be detected for RSV A strain Long, and 14 copies could be detected for RSV B strain 9320, corresponding to 50% tissue culture infective doses of 0.86 and 0.34, respectively. The assay was evaluated on 411 combined nose and throat swabs derived from immunocompromised adults with or without signs of respiratory tract infection. The diagnostic efficacy of the TaqMan PCR determined on the clinical samples showed that this real-time PCR technique was substantially more sensitive than the combination of conventional viral culture and shell vial culture. None of the clinical specimens derived from patients without signs of respiratory illness were found to be positive for RSV by real-time TaqMan PCR.","van Elden, L J R; van Loon, A M; van der Beek, A; Hendriksen, K A W; Hoepelman, A I M; van Kraaij, M G J; Schipper, P; Nijhuis, M",Journal of clinical microbiology,567,28

METHODS Seventy-eight patients with SARS referred to the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases (GIRD), China from December 22, 2002 to March 2003 were studied retrospectively. The data reviewed included those of clinical manifestations, laboratory investigation and roentgenology. RESULTS The patients consisted of 42 men and 36 women, aged 20 - 75 years (mean 37.5 +/- 11.6 years), including 44 infected health-care professionals. Clinical symptoms of these patients were fever (100%), coughing (88%), and dyspnea (80%). Routine blood test revealed WBCs <4.0 x 10(9)/L in 12 patients (15%), (4.0 -10.0) x 10(9)/L in 49 (63%), and over 10.0 x 10(9)/L in 17 (22%) [average (7.6 +/- 5.0) x 10(9)/L]. The level of neutrophilic granulocyte was 0.75 +/- 0.13 and that of lymphocyte was 0.18 +/- 0.11. Chest X-ray and CT scanning revealed changes related to pneumonia. The transmission of the disease was likely via close contact with contagious droplets. The prevalences of acute lung injury (ALI,37 patients) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 21 of the 37 patients) were considerably high among the patients. Seven patients who developed ARDS complicated with MODS died. CONCLUSIONS A history of close contact, fever, X-ray signs of pneumonia and normal or lowered WBC counts are favorable for the diagnosis of SARS. Recognition of ALI as the important index for critical SARS and comprehensive supportive management are of paramount importance in decreasing the mortality of patients with SARS.","Xiao, Zheng-lun; Li, Yi-min; Chen, Rong-chang; Li, Shi-yue; Zhong, Shu-qing; He, Guo-qing; Nong, Ling-bo; Gu, Ying-ying; Zhong, Nan-shan",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,567,16

However, compliance with these guidelines has been inconsistent. This correlational study examined whether individual differences in risky decision-making and motivational propensities predicted compliance with COVID-19 preventative behaviors in a sample of US adults (N = 404). Participants completed an online study from September through December 2020 that included a risky choice decision-making task, temporal discounting task, and measures of appropriate mask-wearing, social distancing, and perceived risk of engaging in public activities. Linear regression results indicated that greater temporal discounting and risky decision-making were associated with less appropriate mask-wearing behavior and social distancing. Additionally, demographic factors, including personal experience with COVID-19 and financial difficulties due to COVID-19, were also associated with differences in COVID-19 preventative behaviors. Path analysis results showed that risky decision-making behavior, temporal discounting, and risk perception collectively predicted 55% of the variance in appropriate mask-wearing behavior.

The challenges faced by patients with prolonged COVID-19-related hospitalizations - social isolation, disability, neurologic sequelae, adjustment-related anxiety, depression, and stress - may be mitigated by the novel use of VR as one modality of a comprehensive rehabilitation plan. This descriptive study aimed to understand patient satisfaction and perceived benefit of virtual reality on a COVID-19 recovery unit, as well as the logistical and operational feasibility of providing VR content for patients and staff. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the COVID-19 surge in New York City in 2020, the COVID-19 Recovery Unit (CRU) of a large academic hospital invited patients and staff to participate in VR sessions with three categories of experience: (1) Guided meditation, (2) Exploration of natural environments, (3) Cognitive stimulation games. Patients and staff were surveyed about satisfaction and perceived benefit. RESULTS: 13 patients and 11 staff were surveyed, with median patient satisfaction scores of 9 out of 10, with ten representing ""extremely satisfied,"" and median staff satisfaction scores of 10. 13/13 patients answered ""yes"" to recommending the therapy to others, and 12/13 answered ""yes"" to perceived enhancement of their treatment. 11/11 staff answered ""yes"" to recommending the therapy to others, and 11/11 answered ""yes"" to perceived enhancement of their wellbeing. DISCUSSION: A VR program implemented on a COVID-19 rehabilitation unit for patients and healthcare providers was rated as highly satisfactory with perceived benefit by survey respondents. Participants commented that the use of VR was useful in coping with isolation and loneliness, and could be implemented within the context of clinical care for COVID-19 patients as part of a comprehensive rehabilitation model. The use of VR was also logistically and operationally feasible on the CRU. Future work to compare benefits of VR to standard neuropsychological rehabilitation is needed.","Kolbe, Laura; Jaywant, Abhishek; Gupta, Alka; Vanderlind, W Michael; Jabbour, Gina",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,567,1

In this study, we investigated the roles of the integrated stress response (ISR) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) family proteins in regulating coronavirus-induced IL-8 and IL-6 upregulation. The mRNA expression of IL-8 and IL-6 was significantly induced in cells infected with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a gammacoronavirus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, an alphacoronavirus. Overexpression of a constitutively active phosphomimetic mutant of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2&#945; (eIF2&#945;), chemical inhibition of its dephosphorylation, or overexpression of its upstream double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) significantly enhanced IL-8 mRNA expression in IBV-infected cells. Overexpression of the AP-1 protein cJUN or its upstream kinase also increased the IBV-induced IL-8 mRNA expression, which was synergistically enhanced by overexpression of cFOS. Taken together, this study demonstrated the important regulatory roles of ISR and AP-1 proteins in IL-8 production during coronavirus infection, highlighting the complex interactions between cellular stress pathways and the innate immune response.","Zhu, Qing Chun; Li, Shumin; Yuan, Li Xia; Chen, Rui Ai; Liu, Ding Xiang; Fung, To Sing",Int. j. mol. sci.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The number of patients diagnosed and treated within 17 of the 18 Unicancer centers was collected in 2020 and compared with that during the same periods between 2016 and 2019. Unicancer centers treat close to 20% of cancer patients in France yearly. The reduction in the number of patients attending the Unicancer centers was analyzed per regions and cancer types. The impact of delayed care on cancer-related deaths was calculated based on different hypotheses. RESULTS: A 6.8% decrease in patients managed within Unicancer in the first 7 months of 2020 versus 2019 was observed. This reduction reached 21% during April and May, and was not compensated in June and July, nor later until November 2020. This reduction was observed only for newly diagnosed patients, while the clinical activity for previously diagnosed patients increased by 4% similar to previous years. The reduction was more pronounced in women, in breast and prostate cancers, and for patients without metastasis. Using an estimated hazard ratio of 1.06 per month of delay in diagnosis and treatment of new patients, we calculated that the delays observed in the 5-month period from March to July 2020 may result in an excess mortality due to cancer of 1000-6000 patients in coming years. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the delays in cancer patient management were observed only for newly diagnosed patients, more frequently in women, for breast cancer, prostate cancer, and nonmetastatic cancers. These delays may result is an excess risk of cancer-related deaths in the coming years.","Blay, J Y; Boucher, S; Le Vu, B; Cropet, C; Chabaud, S; Perol, D; Barranger, E; Campone, M; Conroy, T; Coutant, C; De Crevoisier, R; Debreuve-Theresette, A; Delord, J P; Fumoleau, P; Gentil, J; Gomez, F; Guerin, O; Jaffré, A; Lartigau, E; Lemoine, C; Mahe, M A; Mahon, F X; Mathieu-Daude, H; Merrouche, Y; Penault-Llorca, F; Pivot, X; Soria, J C; Thomas, G; Vera, P; Vermeulin, T; Viens, P; Ychou, M; Beaupere, S",ESMO Open,567,16

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Public hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 362 doctors and 1702 nurses in major departments of five hospitals of three Chinese provinces. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted from October to November 2020, facilitated by hospital administrators through online WeChat/QQ working groups. Data on outcome expectations, self-efficacy, norms, and COVID-19-related work experiences were collected. Multivariate logistic regression models were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The logistic regression analysis showed that physical (e.g., protective effect of vaccination) and self-evaluative outcome expectations (e.g., anticipated regret), self-efficacy, norms (e.g., descriptive norm, subjective norm, professional norm, and moral norm), and job satisfaction were significantly and positively associated with the free and self-paid COVID-19 vaccination intention outcomes among doctors and nurses, adjusted for background variables. Doctors who had engaged in COVID-19-related work reported higher self-paid vaccination intention. CONCLUSIONS: Health promotion is needed to improve the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers. Such interventions may consider modifying the identified factors of vaccination intention, including strengthening perceived efficacy, positive feelings about vaccination, the need to avoid future regret, self-efficacy, and social norms. Future studies should examine the actual behavior patterns of COVID-19 vaccination and testing the efficacy of promotion intervention through randomized controlled studies.","She, Rui; Chen, Xi; Li, Liping; Li, Lijuan; Huang, Zepeng; Lau, Joseph T F",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,567,1

The current standard technologies, i.e., reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, serological assays, and computed tomography (CT) exhibit practical limitations and challenges in case of massive and rapid testing. Biosensors, particularly electrochemical conducting polymer (CP)-based biosensors, are considered as potential alternatives owing to their large advantages such as high selectivity and sensitivity, rapid detection, low cost, simplicity, flexibility, long self-life, and ease of use. Therefore, CP-based biosensors can serve as multisensors, mobile biosensors, and wearable biosensors, facilitating the development of point-of-care (POC) systems and home-use biosensors for COVID-19 detection. However, the application of these biosensors for COVID-19 entails several challenges related to their degradation, low crystallinity, charge transport properties, and weak interaction with biomarkers. To overcome these problems, this study provides scientific evidence for the potential applications of CP-based electrochemical biosensors in COVID-19 detection based on their applications for the detection of various biomarkers such as DNA/RNA, proteins, whole viruses, and antigens. We then propose promising strategies for the development of CP-based electrochemical biosensors for COVID-19 detection.","Tran, Vinh Van; Tran, Nhu Hoa Thi; Hwang, Hye Suk; Chang, Mincheol",Biosens Bioelectron,567,1

Many studies already investigated the effect on different aspects in orthopedic and trauma care. However, the current literature lacks data regarding the consequence on daily surgical business. Thus, the aim of the present study was to analyze the development of knee-related pathologies and surgical procedures in a German university level-one trauma center during the lockdown phase and early lockdown phase to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on orthopedic and trauma knee surgery. Material and Methods. The amount of knee joint surgeries performed during the high-peak COVID-19 crisis in the period of January to May 2020 was evaluated retrospectively and compared to the corresponding time periods of the previous years (2017-2019). Results: The COVID-19 lockdown led to a significant decrease in the number of knee injuries in March and April 2020 by 83.3%. Surgical procedures were reduced by 84.8% during the same period. In May 2020, the number of knee joint procedures returned to an almost prepandemic level. The distribution of urgent and elective knee surgery changed to predominantly acute trauma care at the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown and persisted through to May 2020. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic had a high impact on emergency and elective knee surgery in a level-one trauma center in Germany during the lockdown phase. It also showed that a level-one trauma center in the German healthcare system is able to handle urgent trauma and orthopedic operations during a worldwide medical crisis and to return to a prepandemic level within a short phase.","Koch, Matthias; Popp, Daniel; Freigang, Viola; Frankewycz, Borys; Hierl, Katja; Angele, Peter; Alt, Volker; Worlicek, Michael",Biomed Res Int,567,24

We aimed to evaluate whether mavrilimumab, a monoclonal antibody to the GM-CSF receptor, would improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and systemic hyperinflammation. Methods: This investigator-initiated, multicentre, double-blind, randomised trial was done at seven hospitals in the USA. Inclusion required hospitalisation, COVID-19 pneumonia, hypoxaemia, and a C-reactive protein concentration of more than 5 mg/dL. Patients were excluded if they required mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) centrally, with stratification by hospital site, to receive mavrilimumab 6 mg/kg as a single intravenous infusion, or placebo. Participants and all clinical and research personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients alive and off supplemental oxygen therapy at day 14. The primary outcome and safety were analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04399980, NCT04463004, and NCT04492514. Findings: Between May 28 and Sept 15, 2020, 40 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to mavrilimumab (n=21) or placebo (n=19). A trial of 60 patients was planned, but given slow enrolment, the study was stopped early to inform the natural history and potential treatment effect. At day 14, 12 (57%) patients in the mavrilimumab group were alive and off supplemental oxygen therapy compared with nine (47%) patients in the placebo group (odds ratio 1·48 [95% CI 0·43-5·16]; p=0·76). There were no treatment-related deaths, and adverse events were similar between groups. Interpretation: There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients alive and off oxygen therapy at day 14, although benefit or harm of mavrilimumab therapy in this patient population remains possible given the wide confidence intervals, and larger trials should be completed.

This retrospective chart review was undertaken to explore postoperative pain within 48 hours among patients who underwent laparoscopic liver resections (LLR), receiving either IA with or without patient-controlled analgesia (IA±PCA) versus PCA alone. METHODS: After ethics approval, charts were reviewed for adult patients who underwent LLR between January 2016 and April 2019, and had IA±PCA or PCA alone. Patients with any contraindication to IA with morphine, obstructive sleep apnea, body mass index >40 kg/m2, history of chronic pain, and/or history of drug use were excluded. Descriptive statistics used to describe postoperative pain levels at 48 hours by treatment group for each pain outcome. RESULTS: Of 111 patients identified, 79 patients were finally included; 22 patients had IA±PCA and 57 patients had PCA only. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics, use of non-opioid pain control, and postoperative complications between the two groups. IA use was associated with reduced postoperative opioid consumption (measured in oral morphine equivalents) compared to PCA alone (mean difference [95% confidence interval] -45.92 [-83.10 to -8.75]; p=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: IA has the potential to decrease postoperative opioid use for patients undergoing LLR, and appears to be safe and effective in the setting of LLR.

The applicants were equally qualified except that, in each pair, one applicant informed about mental health problems as an explanation for a past employment break. The results show that applicants who disclose mental health problems are discriminated against in hiring processes. Applicants with mental health problems have about 27% lower probability of receiving an invitation to a job interview and about 22% lower probability of receiving any positive employer response. These results do not seem to have been driven by the COVID-19 crisis that unfolded during the course of the study.

Here we used a household cohort study to determine the features of household transmission of COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 105 index patients and 392 household contacts were enrolled. Both index patients and household members were tested by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Information on all recruited individuals was extracted from medical records and confirmed or supplemented by telephone interviews. The baseline characteristics of index cases and contact patients were described. Secondary attack rates of SARS-CoV-2 to contact members were computed and the risk factors for transmission within the household were estimated. RESULTS: Secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 developed in 64 of 392 household contacts (16.3%). The secondary attack rate to children was 4% compared with 17.1% for adults. The secondary attack rate to the contacts within the households with index patients quarantined by themselves since onset of symptoms was 0% compared with 16.9% for contacts without quarantined index patients. The secondary attack rate to contacts who were spouses of index cases was 27.8% compared with 17.3% for other adult members in the households. CONCLUSIONS: The secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 in household is 16.3%. Age of household contacts and spousal relationship to the index case are risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within a household.

It shares homology with SARS and MERS-CoV, responsible for past outbreaks in China and in Middle East. SARS-CoV2 spread from China where the first infections were described in December 2019 and is responsible for the respiratory symptoms that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. A cytokine storm has been shown in patients who develop fatal complications, as observed in past coronavirus infections. The management includes ventilatory support and broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, empirically utilized, as a targeted therapy and vaccines have not been developed. Based upon our limited knowledge on the pathogenesis of CoViD-19, a potential role of some anti-rheumatic drugs may be hypothesized, acting as direct antivirals or targeting host immune response. Antimalarial drugs, commonly used in rheumatology, may alter the lysosomal proteases that mediates the viral entry into the cell and have demonstrated efficacy in improving the infection. Anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 may interfere with the cytokine storm in severe cases and use of tocilizumab has shown good outcomes in a small cohort. Baricitinib has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Checkpoints inhibitors such as anti-CD200 and anti-PD1 could have a role in the treatment of CoViD-19.

In this work, an electrical impedance flow cytometry was fabricated based on microfluidics with constriction microchannel to simultaneously characterize the mechanical and electrical properties of single plant cells. Protoplasts from two model plant species, the herbaceous Arabidopsis thaliana and the woody Populus trichocarpa, could be readily discriminated by their respective mechanical traits, but not by electrical impedance. On the contrary, overexpression of a red fluorescent protein (RFP) on plasma membrane resulted in changes in cell electrical impedance instead of cell deformability. During primary cell wall (PCW) regeneration, this extracellular layer outside of protoplasts introduced dramatic variations in both mechanical and electrical properties of single plant cells. Furthermore, the effects of auxin, an essential phytohormone regulating PCW reformation, were validated on this platform. Taken together, our results revealed a novel application of microfluidic impedance flow cytometry in the field of plant science to simultaneously characterize dual biophysical properties at single cell resolution, which could be further developed as a powerful and reliable tool for plant cell phenotyping and cell fate specification.","Han, Ziyu; Chen, Lincai; Zhang, Shuaihua; Wang, Jiehua; Duan, Xuexin",Anal. chem,567,1

Pregnant women were included if they were admitted to hospital between 1 March and 30 June 2020 and had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test &#8804;14 days prior to admission. Cause of admission was classified as obstetric or COVID-19-related. RESULTS: In the study areas, 214 pregnant women with a positive test were admitted to hospital, of which 56 women required hospital care due to COVID-19. The risk of admission due to COVID-19 was 0.4/1000 deliveries in Denmark, Finland and Norway, and 3.8/1000 deliveries in the Swedish regions. Women hospitalized because of COVID-19 were more frequently obese (p < 0.001) and had a migrant background (p < 0.001) compared with the total population of women who delivered in 2018. Twelve women (21.4%) needed intensive care. Among the 56 women admitted due to COVID-19, 48 women delivered 51 infants. Preterm delivery (n = 12, 25%, p < 0.001) and cesarean delivery (n = 21, 43.8%, p < 0.001) were more frequent in women with COVID-19 compared with women who delivered in 2018. No maternal deaths, stillbirths or neonatal deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of admission due to COVID-19 disease in pregnancy was low in the Nordic countries. A fifth of the women required intensive care and we observed higher rates of preterm and cesarean deliveries. National public health policies appear to have had an impact on the risk of admission due to severe COVID-19 disease in pregnancy. Nordic collaboration is important in collecting robust data and assessing rare outcomes.","Engjom, Hilde; Aabakke, Anna J M; Klungsøyr, Kari; Svanvik, Teresia; Äyräs, Outi; Jonasdottir, Eva; Thurn, Lars; Jones, Elin; Pettersson, Karin; Nyfløt, Lill T; Al-Zirqi, Iqbal; Vangen, Siri; Júlíusson, Pétur B; Källén, Karin; Gissler, Mika; Krebs, Lone",Acta obstet. gynecol. scand,567,16

Methods: Data of clinical manifestation, laboratory examination, bronchoscopy, echocardiography and cardiopulmonary pathological results were retrospectively reviewed in a case of COVID-19 with rapid exacerbation from mild to critical condition. Results: This patient hospitalized at day 9 post 2019 novel coronavirus(2019-nCoV) infection, experienced progressive deterioration from mild to severe at day 12, severe to critical at day 18 and underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) and continuous renal replacement therapy(CRRT) as well as heart lung transplantation during day 28-45 post infection, and died at the second day post heart and lung transplantation. The patient had suffered from hypertension for 8 years. At the early stage of the disease, his symptoms were mild and the inflammatory indices increased and the lymphocyte count decreased continuously. The patient's condition exacerbated rapidly with multi-organ infections, and eventually developed pulmonary hemorrhage and consolidation, pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, liver dysfunction, etc. His clinical manifestations could not be improved despite viral RNAs test results became negative. The patient underwent lung and heart transplantation and finally died of multi organ failure at the second day post lung and heart transplantation. Pathological examination indicated massive mucus, dark red secretions and blood clots in bronchus.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the placental pathology findings in a preselected cohort of neonates infected by transplacental transmission arising from maternal infection with SARS-CoV-2, and to identify pathology risk factors for placental and fetal infection. DESIGN: Case-based retrospective analysis by a multinational group of 19 perinatal specialists of the placental pathology findings from 2 cohorts of infants delivered to mothers testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 - liveborn neonates infected via transplacental transmission who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after delivery and had SARS-CoV-2 identified in cells of the placental fetal compartment by molecular pathology; and stillborn infants with syncytiotrophoblast positive for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: In placentas from all 6 liveborn neonates acquiring SARS-CoV-2 via transplacental transmission the syncytiotrophoblast was positive for coronavirus using immunohistochemistry, RNA in situ hybridization, or both. All 6 placentas had chronic histiocytic intervillositis and necrosis of the syncytiotrophoblast. The 5 stillborn/terminated infants had placental pathology findings that were similar including SARS-CoV-2 infection of the syncytiotrophoblast, chronic histiocytic intervillositis and syncytiotrophoblast necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic histiocytic intervillositis together with syncytiotrophoblast necrosis accompany SARS-CoV-2 infection of syncytiotrophoblast in liveborn and stillborn infants. Their coexistence in all placentas from liveborn infants acquiring their infection prior to delivery indicates that that these findings constitute a pathology risk factor for transplacental fetal infection. Potential mechanisms of infection of the placenta and fetus with SARS-CoV-2, and potential future studies, are discussed.","Schwartz, David A; Baldewijns, Marcella; Benachi, Alexandra; Bugatti, Mattia; Collins, Rebecca R J; De Luca, Danièle; Facchetti, Fabio; Linn, Rebecca L; Marcelis, Lukas; Morotti, Denise; Morotti, Raffaella; Parks, W Tony; Patanè, Luisa; Prevot, Sophie; Pulinx, Bianca; Rajaram, Veena; Strybol, David; Thomas, Kristen; Vivanti, Alexandre J",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

Vaccination has started in most countries around the world. In this study, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of strategies for COVID-19 vaccination for Turkey compared to a baseline in the absence of vaccination and imposed measures by using an enhanced SIRD (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered, Death) model and various scenarios for the first year after vaccination. The results showed that vaccination is cost-effective from a health care perspective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 511 USD/QALY and 1045 USD/QALY if vaccine effectiveness on transmission is equal or reduced to only 50% of effectiveness on disease, respectively, at the 90% baseline effectiveness of the vaccine. From a societal perspective, cost savings were estimated for both scenarios. Other results further showed that the minimum required vaccine uptake to be cost-effective would be at least 30%. Sensitivity and scenario analyses, as well as the iso-ICER curves, showed that the results were quite robust and that major changes in cost-effectiveness outcomes cannot be expected. We can conclude that COVID-19 vaccination in Turkey is highly cost-effective or even cost-saving.","Hagens, A.; Inkaya, A.

If infection provides substantial long-lasting immunity, it may be appropriate to reconsider vaccination distribution plans. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study of one multi-hospital health system included 150,325 patients tested for COVID-19 infection via PCR from March 12, 2020 to August 30, 2020. Testing performed up to February 24, 2021 in these patients was included for analysis. The main outcome was reinfection, defined as infection &#8805; 90 days after initial testing. Secondary outcomes were symptomatic infection and protection of prior infection against reinfection. RESULTS: Of 150,325 patients, 8,845 (5.9%) tested positive and 141,480 (94.1%) tested negative prior to August 30. 1,278 (14.4%) of the positive patients were retested after 90 days, and 62 had possible reinfection. Of those, 31 (50%) were symptomatic. Of those with initial negative testing, 5,449 (3.9%) were subsequently positive and 3,191 of those (58.5%) were symptomatic. Protection offered from prior infection was 81.8% (95% confidence interval 76.6 to 85.8), and against symptomatic infection was 84.5% (95% confidence interval 77.9 to 89.1). This protection increased over time. CONCLUSIONS: Prior infection in patients with COVID-19 was highly protective against reinfection and symptomatic disease. This protection increased over time, suggesting that viral shedding or ongoing immune response may persist beyond 90 days and may not represent true reinfection. As vaccine supply is limited, patients with known history of COVID-19 could delay early vaccination to allow for the most vulnerable to access the vaccine and slow transmission.","Sheehan, Megan M; Reddy, Anita J; Rothberg, Michael B",Clin. infect. dis,567,22

Conventionally, public health is viewed as an evidence-based profession that is above politics. Yet national responses to COVID-19 in India reveal the embeddedness of health and illnesses in the larger politics of the state. Although it is still early to assess the full spectrum of damage caused by lack of central-level planning, this article argues against COVID-19 being viewed as a 'great leveller'. Rather, it suggests that we inhabit somatic societies that regularly employ the vocabulary of pathology/disease to determine social health. Moreover, the Indian experience illustrates how, even during a pandemic, 'social distancing' is not an apolitical notion. It becomes a measure for the state to co-opt scientific interventions of risk mitigation and relay them to people as a metaphor for exclusion: thereby exacerbating deeper structural inequities around which access to health and well-being of the population is organised.","Rahman, Sabina Yasmin",Health Sociol Rev,567,16

In this study, we assessed the prevalence and incidence of MG infection in MSM enrolled in the open-label phase of the ANRS IPERGAY trial with on demand TDF/FTC for HIV prevention and the impact of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). METHODS: 210 subjects were tested at baseline and at 6 months by real-time PCR assays for MG detection in urine samples, oro-pharyngeal and anal swabs. Resistance to azithromycin (AZM), to fluoroquinolones (FQ) and to doxycycline were investigated in the French National Reference Centre of bacterial STI. RESULTS: The all-site prevalence of MG at baseline was 10.5% [6.3% in urine samples, 4.3% in anal swabs and 0.5% in throat swabs] and remained unchanged at 6 months whether or not PEP was used: 9.9% overall, 10.2% with PEP and 9.6% without. The overall rate of MG resistance (prevalent and incident cases) to AZM and FQ was 67.6% and 9.1%, respectively, with no difference between arms. An in vivo mutation of the MG 16S rRNA which could be associated with tetracycline resistance was observed in 12.5% of specimens tested. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MG infection among MSM on PrEP was high and its incidence was not decreased by doxycycline prophylaxis with a similar high rate of AZM- and FQ-resistance, raising challenging issues for the treatment of this STI and supporting current recommendations to avoid testing or treatment of asymptomatic MG infection.","Berçot, Béatrice; Charreau, Isabelle; Clotilde, Rousseau; Delaugerre, Constance; Chidiac, Christian; Pialoux, Gilles; Capitant, Catherine; Bourgeois-Nicolaos, Nadège; Raffi, François; Pereyre, Sabine; Le Roy, Chloé; Senneville, Eric; Meyer, Laurence; Bébéar, Cécile; Molina, Jean-Michel",Clin. infect. dis,567,17

METHODS: Seven focus groups with 28 undergraduate physical therapist students were conducted following the transitioning to full eLearning as a result of strict physical distancing measures. Focus group questions explored the students' experiences of the transition from face-to-face to full eLearning approach and the students' recommendations for improving future eLearning experiences. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The 3 themes identified were: (1) students presenting heightened negative feelings such as anxiety, stress, and reduced motivation to study; (2) students continuing to value the face-to-face learning, as it provided social support and facilitated feedback from peers and tutors; (3) student recommendations for eLearning included having online lectures and supplementary videos but face-to-face practical classes and developing healthy learning habits such as scheduled times for studying, exercise, and other activities that regulate stress. CONCLUSIONS: The transition to a full eLearning approach in an undergraduate physical therapist education program during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that students had heightened negative emotions due to the pandemic. Students valued face-to-face practical classes to learn and receive social support from peers and tutors. Student recommendations to future eLearning suggested changes to curriculum development geared toward a greater blended approach to learning. Blended learning may include using online lectures instead of face-to-face lectures and online resources to supplement student learning of practical skills. IMPACT: As higher education moves toward a more blended approach, lessons learned from this study can help educators design future physical therapist education programs. The findings can also assist programs in delivering a full eLearning approach as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.","Ng, Leo; Seow, Kuang Cheng; MacDonald, Laetitia; Correia, Christina; Reubenson, Alan; Gardner, Peter; Spence, Angela L; Bunzli, Samantha; De Oliveira, Beatriz Ito Ramos",Phys. ther,567,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 61 patients with COVID-19 were divided into groups with common symptoms and with severe diseases, and clinical data were collected to analyze and compare the differences between them. RESULTS In patients with severe COVID-19, compared with the common group, lymphocyte count and albumin levels were lower, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea, blood creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and prothrombin time (PT) were elevated (all P<0.05). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), mean platelet volume-to-lymphocyte ratio (MPVLR), and C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR) were significantly elevated in the severe group compared with the group with common symptoms; however, the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) was significantly reduced (P<0.05). Univariate logistic regression showed that lower lymphocyte count, prolonged PT, elevated CRP and LDH levels, and elevated NLR, PLR, MPVLR, and CAR were risk factors for COVID-19 severity (P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression showed that elevated CRP levels (odds ratio [OR], 0.028; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.002-0.526; P=0.017), prolonged PT (OR, 0.014; 95% CI: 0.001-0.341; P=0.09), and an MPVLR >8.9 (OR, 0.026; 95% CI: 0.002-0.349; P=0.006) were independent risk factors for COVID-19 severity.

Fatal outcomes in patients with these characteristics are due to a dysfunctional immune response. Understanding COVID-19's immunopathogenesis helps in designing strategies to prevent and mitigate complications during treatment. OBJECTIVE: Describe the main immunopathogenic alterations of COVID-19 in patients of advanced age or with chronic non-communicable diseases. DATA ACQUISITION: We carried out a bibliographic search of primary references in PubMed, Elsevier, Science Direct and SciELO. A total of 270 articles met our initial search criteria. Duplicate articles or those unrelated to at least one chronic comorbidity, senescence or inflammation and those that studied only patient clinical characteristics, laboratory tests or treatments were excluded. Finally, our selection included 124 articles for analysis: 10 meta-analyses, 24 original research articles, 67 review articles, 9 editorials, 9 comments, 3 books and 2 websites. DEVELOPMENT: Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are the most common comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. Risk of developing severe manifestations of the disease, including death, is increased in senescent and obese patients and those with cardiovascular disease, cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Low-grade chronic inflammation is characteristic of all these conditions, reflected in a pro-inflammatory state, endothelial dysfunction, and changes to innate immunity; mainly of the monocyte-macrophage system with changes in polarization, inflammation, cytotoxicity and altered antigenic presentation. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, mechanisms involved in acute inflammation overlap with the patient's pro-inflammatory state, causing immune system dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2 infection amplifies already-existing alterations, causing failures in the immune system's control mechanisms. The resulting cytokine storm causes an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response marked by high serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers and a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile with decompensation of underlying diseases. In asthma, chronic eosinophilic inflammation protects against infection by producing a reduced interferon-mediated response and a reduced number of ACE2 receptors. CONCLUSIONS: Low-grade chronic inflammation present in advanced age and chronic diseases-but not in bronchial asthma-produces a pro-inflammatory state that triggers a dysregulated immune response, favoring development of severe forms of COVID-19 and increasing lethality.","Suárez-Reyes, Anamary; Villegas-Valverde, Carlos A",MEDICC Rev,567,17

We aimed to test the hypotheses that low vitamin K status is a common characteristic of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to population controls and that low vitamin K status predicts mortality in COVID-19 patients. In a cohort of 138 COVID-19 patients and 138 population controls, we measured plasma dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated Matrix Gla Protein (dp-ucMGP), which reflects the functional vitamin K status in peripheral tissue. Forty-three patients died within 90 days from admission. In patients, levels of dp-ucMGP differed significantly between survivors (mean 877; 95% CI: 778; 995) and non-survivors (mean 1445; 95% CI: 1148; 1820). Furthermore, levels of dp-ucMGP (pmol/L) were considerably higher in patients (mean 1022; 95% CI: 912; 1151) compared to controls (mean 509; 95% CI: 485; 540). Cox regression survival analysis showed that increasing levels of dp-ucMGP (reflecting low vitamin K status) were associated with higher mortality risk (sex- and age-adjusted hazard ratio per doubling of dp-ucMGP was 1.49, 95% CI: 1.03; 2.24). The association attenuated and became statistically insignificant after adjustment for co-morbidities (sex, age, CVD, diabetes, BMI, and eGFR adjusted hazard ratio per doubling of dp-ucMGP was 1.22, 95% CI: 0.82; 1.80). In conclusion, we found that low vitamin K status was associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 in sex- and age-adjusted analyses, but not in analyses additionally adjusted for co-morbidities. Randomized clinical trials would be needed to clarify a potential role, if any, of vitamin K in the course of COVID-19.","Linneberg, Allan; Kampmann, Freja Bach; Israelsen, Simone Bastrup; Andersen, Liv Rabøl; Jørgensen, Henrik Løvendahl; Sandholt, Håkon; Jørgensen, Niklas Rye; Thysen, Sanne Marie; Benfield, Thomas",Nutrients,567,24

Recent studies suggest that PP in spontaneously breathing, nonintubated patients with acute respiratory failure is well tolerated and improves oxygenation. However, little is known regarding patient triggered ventilation in intubated patients with ARDS undergoing PP. We conducted a retrospective review of our experience with placing patients in the prone position in 2 cohorts of subjects with moderate and severe ARDS (ie, one cohort with ARDS related to COVID-19, the other with ARDS unrelated to COVID-19), many of whom were receiving pressure support ventilation (PSV). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis in a single 22-bed mixed ICU. The subjects included in the analysis were &#8805; 18 y old, met the Berlin definition for moderate or severe ARDS (whether related COVID-19 or not), and underwent PP during invasive ventilation. RESULTS: 39 subjects were included in the analysis: 20 subjects had ARDS related to COVID-19, while 19 had ARDS related to other etiologies. A total of 113 PP episodes were analyzed: 84 during PSV and 29 during volume control continuous mandatory ventilation. PP during PSV was well tolerated and was effective in improving arterial oxygenation (ie, an increase of median [Formula: see text] from 100 mm Hg [interquartile range 75-120] before PP to 135 mm Hg [interquartile range 111-161] at the end of the PP session, P < .0001). No significant difference between continuous mandatory ventilation and PSV was noted regarding arterial oxygenation during PP. Compared with continuous mandatory ventilation mode, PP during PSV was associated with a significant decrease in the use of neuromuscular blocking agents (4% vs 69% of subjects, P < .001), while sedative requirements remained unchanged.

The COVID-19 outbreak is unique in its rapid transmission and results in heavy stress for the front-line health care workers (HCWs). The current study aimed to exam posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs) of HCWs fighting for the COVID-19 and to evaluate their sleep quality after 1-month stressful suffering. Three hundred seventy-seven HCWs working in different provinces of China participated in the survey between February 1 and 5. The demographic information was collected first. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were selected to measure PTSSs and sleep quality. Results showed that 1 month after the outbreak, the prevalence of PTSSs was 3.8% in HCWs. Female HCWs were more vulnerable to PTSSs with hazard ratio of 2.136 (95% CI = 1.388-3.286). HCWs with higher exposure level also significantly rated more hyperarousal symptoms (hazard ratio = 4.026, 95% CI = 1.233-13.140). There was a significant difference of sleep quality between participants with and without PTSSs (z value = 6.014, p < .001) and among different groups with various contact frequencies (chi-square = 7.307, p = .026). Path analysis showed that there was a significant indirect effect from exposure level to PTSSs through sleep quality (coefficient = 1.750, 95% CI of Boostroop test = 0.543-2.998). In summary, targeted interventions on sleep contribute to the mental recovery during the outbreak of COVID-19. Understanding the mental health response after a public health emergency might help HCWs and communities prepare for a population's response to disaster.","Yin, Qianlan; Sun, Zhuoer; Liu, Tuanjie; Ni, Xiong; Deng, Xuanfeng; Jia, Yanpu; Shang, Zhilei; Zhou, Yaoguang; Liu, Weizhi",Clin Psychol Psychother,567,10

We systematically searched for studies of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, as well as neutralization data for variants, and used a previously published statistical model to predict vaccine efficacy against variants. Overall, we estimate the efficacy of mRNA-1273 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against infection caused by the Delta variant to be 25-50% lower than that of prototype strains. The predicted efficacy against symptomatic illness of the mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 are 95.1% (UI: 88.4-98.1%) and 80.8% (60.7-92.3%), respectively, which are higher than that of adenovirus-vector vaccines Ad26.COV2.S (44.8%, UI: 29.8-60.1%) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (41.1%, 19.8-62.8%).

We have been running virtual cardiology clinics as per Health Service Executive guidance. AIMS: Our study aims to determine how virtual clinics change practice vs traditional clinics. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on patients attending cardiology clinics in our hospital from 6 January to 13 March 2020 ('traditional clinic', n = 1644), compared with clinics during the COVID-19 outbreak, from 16 March to 22 April 2020 ('virtual clinic', n = 691), with the same medical staff. RESULTS: There was no difference in age (61 vs 60), case mix or new vs return appointments in virtual vs traditional clinics. There were similar rates of clinic participation, 71.8% vs 74.2%. A lower proportion of investigations (e.g. imaging) were booked in virtual (38.5%) vs traditional (55.7%) clinics, p < 0.00001. Management changes (e.g. medication changes) were less frequent in virtual (19.9%) vs traditional (38.5%) clinics, p < 0.00001. However, the discharge rate was higher in virtual (28.8%) vs traditional (19.5%) clinics, p = 0.00003. CONCLUSION: This study highlights that virtual clinic consultations are associated with fewer investigations, fewer management changes, and increased discharge rates compared with traditional consultations. These practice changes would reduce costs and hospital outpatient congestion by avoiding unnecessary hospital reviews. Nonetheless, it is unknown whether patients requiring face-to-face consultations could be missed as a result of this virtual approach. Longitudinal studies are required to assess clinical outcomes as a result of these practice changes and whether patient satisfaction is altered.","Offiah, Gregory; O039,; Connor, Cormac; Waters, Max; Hickey, Niall; Loo, Bryan; Moore, David; Mulcahy, David; Maher, Vincent",Ir. j. med. sci,567,15

The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need for streamlined regulatory approval processes-which can be achieved in part through regulatory convergence and cooperation-both to accelerate availability of COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and diagnostics and to maintain the availability of the existing medical products unrelated to COVID-19. METHODS: The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Life Sciences Innovation Forum (LSIF) established the Regulatory Harmonization Steering Committee (RHSC) in 2008 to advance regulatory convergence among APEC's 21 member economies. Key performance indicators (KPIs) were developed in 2018 to measure convergence. RESULTS: This paper reports survey results collected from KPI tracking in March 2020 from medical product regulatory authorities in all 21 APEC economies concerning areas of regulatory practice in which they could converge and cooperate. For example, from 2008 to 2020, there was a 14.3% increase in the number of APEC member economy regulatory authorities sharing Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) Certificates and a 28% increase in the number of regulatory authorities accepting multisite licenses in that same period. In addition, this paper explores how APEC economies could realize a maximum level of regulatory convergence and cooperation. CONCLUSIONS: Convergence efforts within APEC can accelerate availability of medical products including that related to COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and diagnostics, while maintaining the availability of the existing medical products unrelated to COVID-19 vaccines and treatment. New KPIs and capability building are to be considered to enable a new era of innovation ushered in by COVID-19.","Chong, Sannie Siaw Foong; Kim, Mirinea; Limoli, Michelle; Obscherning, Eric; Wu, Patricia; Feisee, Lila; Nakashima, Nobumasa; Lim, John C W",Ther Innov Regul Sci,567,25

As of February 4, 2020, approximately 20,000 confirmed cases had been identified in China and an additional 159 confirmed cases in 23 other countries, including 11 in the United States (2,3). On January 17, CDC and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection began health screenings at U.S. airports to identify ill travelers returning from Wuhan City (4). CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center on January 21 and formalized a process for inquiries regarding persons suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection (2). As of January 31, 2020, CDC had responded to clinical inquiries from public health officials and health care providers to assist in evaluating approximately 650 persons thought to be at risk for 2019-nCoV infection. Guided by CDC criteria for the evaluation of persons under investigation (PUIs) (5), 210 symptomatic persons were tested for 2019-nCoV; among these persons, 148 (70%) had travel-related risk only, 42 (20%) had close contact with an ill laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient or PUI, and 18 (9%) had both travel- and contact-related risks.

The aim of this study was to assess the psychological impact of the pandemic on dental students in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among dental students from different universities in Saudi Arabia selected using 2-stage cluster sampling. The psychological impact was assessed using the validated Arabic version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Item questionnaire. The data were analyzed using SPSS software. The Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used as appropriate. A chi-squared test was used to compare the proportions between the sociodemographic data and logistic regression analysis to identify variables associated with the student's responses. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the scale was excellent (0.954). A total of 697 dental students participated voluntarily in the study; their mean age was 21.76 ± 1.859 years, and 54.7% were female. The majority (96.1%) were single, and 69.4% lived in a household of > 5 persons. Significant differences in mental health outcomes were evident for gender, university, and survey time. Elevated levels of depression, anxiety, and stress were recorded among 60.64%, 37.02%, and 34.92%, respectively, of the students. Females, students who lived alone, and junior students were more likely to experience psychological problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of elevated levels of depression, anxiety and stress among dental students highlights the need for psychological empowerment strategies involving institutional counseling services.","Hakami, Zaki; Khanagar, Sanjeev B; Vishwanathaiah, Satish; Hakami, Abrar; Bokhari, Ahmed M; Jabali, Ahmad H; Alasmari, Dhafer; Aldrees, Abdullah M",J. dent. educ,567,24

Patients younger than 18 years of age, with end stage kidney disease or with a kidney transplant were excluded. AKI was defined according to KDIGO criteria. Of 5,449 patients admitted with Covid-19, AKI developed in 1,993 (36.6%). The peak stages of AKI were stage 1 in 46.5%, stage 2 in 22.4% and stage 3 in 31.1%. Of these, 14.3% required renal replacement therapy (RRT). AKI was primarily seen in Covid-19 patients with respiratory failure, with 89.7% of patients on mechanical ventilation developing AKI compared to 21.7% of non-ventilated patients. 276/285 (96.8%) of patients requiring RRT were on ventilators.

The pandemic has required decisive leadership and collaboration across all sectors of society informed by the best available evidence. In this commentary, we argue that in order to create a robust public health system equipped to address current and future public health challenges, we must prioritize and invest in stronger relationships between public health practice and academia. We briefly review key recommendations following the SARS outbreak, particularly those calling for stronger linkages between public health academia and practice settings in Canada. We then propose key actions for strengthening these linkages. Echoing other COVID-19-related calls, which request long-term reinvestment in public health education and training, we recommend the following actions: (1) Improve collaboration between education programs and public health agencies to address system needs (e.g., surge capacity) and persisting health inequities; (2) Fund a pan-Canadian public health training initiative that builds on a renewed set of public health competencies to address priority training needs (e.g., equity-oriented leadership); and (3) Prepare a cadre of certified public health leaders who can progress along public health career pathways, including those already in practice.","Di Ruggiero, Erica; Papadopoulos, Andrew; Steinberg, Malcolm; Blais, Régis; Frandsen, Natalie; Valcour, James; Penney, Greg",Can J Public Health,567,16

However, it is labor-intensive and costly to carry it out. Some countries have faced challenges implementing contact tracing, and no impact evaluations using empirical data have assessed its impact on COVID-19 mortality. This study assesses the impact of contact tracing in a middle-income country, providing data to support the expansion and optimization of contact tracing strategies to improve infection control. METHODS: We obtained publicly available data on all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Colombia between March 2 and June 16, 2020. (N = 54,931 cases over 135 days of observation). As suggested by WHO guidelines, we proxied contact tracing performance as the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing out of all cases identified. We calculated the daily proportion of cases identified through contact tracing across 37 geographical units (32 departments and five districts). Further, we used a sequential log-log fixed-effects model to estimate the 21-days, 28-days, 42-days, and 56-days lagged impact of the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing on daily COVID-19 mortality. Both the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing and the daily number of COVID-19 deaths are smoothed using 7-day moving averages. Models control for the prevalence of active cases, second-degree polynomials, and mobility indices. Robustness checks to include supply-side variables were performed. RESULTS: We found that a 10 percent increase in the proportion of cases identified through contact tracing is related to COVID-19 mortality reductions between 0.8% and 3.4%. Our models explain between 47%-70% of the variance in mortality. Results are robust to changes of specification and inclusion of supply-side variables. CONCLUSION: Contact tracing is instrumental in containing infectious diseases. Its prioritization as a surveillance strategy will substantially impact reducing deaths while minimizing the impact on the fragile economic systems of lower and middle-income countries. This study provides lessons for other LMIC.","Vecino-Ortiz, Andres I; Villanueva Congote, Juliana; Zapata Bedoya, Silvana; Cucunuba, Zulma M",PLoS One,567,29

Samples were initially analyzed by sandwich lateral flow immunochromatographic assay and then further processed by RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) targeting the M gene followed by sequencing. RT-PCR based positive (n=20) and negative (n=20) dogs were samples for their blood for the haemato-biochemical analysis. A questionnaire was used to collect data from pet owners, in order to analyze the data for risk factors analysis by chi square test on SPSS. The prevalence of CCoV was 35.1%, and 23.8 % through Sandwich lateral flow immunochromatographic and RT-PCR respectively. Various risk factors like breed, age, sex, vomiting, diarrhea, sample source, body size, cohabitation with other animals, living environment, food, deworming history, contact with other animals or birds feces, and season were significantly associated with CCoV. The CCoV identified in Pakistan were 98% similar with the isolates from China (KT 192675, 1), South Korea (HM 130573, 1), Brazil (GU 300134, 1), Colombia (MH 717721, 1), United Kingdom (JX 082356, 1) and Tunisia (KX156806).

With government-imposed restrictions as well as a general burden on healthcare systems, the pandemic has the potential to disrupt the access to, and delivery of, mental healthcare. Methods Electronic healthcare records from primary care psychological therapy services (Improving Access to Psychological Therapy) in England were used to examine changes in access to mental health services and service delivery during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive time series was conducted using data from five NHS trusts to examine patterns in referrals to services (1st January 2019 to 24th May 2020) and appointments (1st January 2020 to 24th May 2020) taking place. Findings The number of patients accessing mental health services dropped by an average of 55% in the early weeks after the March 2020 lockdown was announced, reaching a maximum reduction of 74% in the initial 3 weeks after lockdown in the UK, which gradually recovered to a 28% reduction by May. We found some evidence suggesting changes in the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of referrals. Despite a reduction in access, the impact on appointments appeared limited with service providers shifting to remote delivery of care. Interpretation Services appeared to adapt to provide continuity of care in mental healthcare. However, patients accessing services reduced, potentially placing a future burden on service.

Surprisingly, we found that in addition to protection against HIV-1 infection, N3G was also highly effective in inhibiting infection of human beta-coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and SARS-CoV-2, possibly by binding the HR2 region in the spike protein of beta-coronaviruses to block their hexameric structure formation. These studies demonstrate the potential utility of anti-HIV-1 HR1 peptides in inhibiting human beta-coronavirus infection. Moreover, this strategy could be extended to the design of broad-spectrum antivirals based on the supercoiling structure of peptides.","Wang, C.; Xia, S.; Wang, X.; Li, Y.; Wang, H.; Xiang, R.; Jiang, Q.; Lan, Q.; Liang, R.; Li, Q.; Huo, S.; Lu, L.; Wang, Q.; Yu, F.; Liu, K.; Jiang, S.",Journal of Medicinal Chemistry,567,16

Almost all hospital departments have had to profoundly modify their activity to cope with the crisis. In this context, the surgical management of cancers has been a topic of debate as care strategies were tailored to avoid any delay in treatment that could be detrimental to patient wellbeing while being careful not to overload intensive care units. The primary objective of this study was to observe changes in the surgical management of pelvic cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic in France. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study analyzed data from the prospective multi-center cohort study conducted by the French Society for Pelvic and Gynecological Surgery (SCGP) with methodological support from the French (FRANCOGYN) Group. All members of the SCGP received by e-mail a link allowing them to include patients who were scheduled to undergo gynecological carcinologic surgery between March 16th 2020 and May 11th 2020. Demographic data, the characteristics of cancers and the impact of the crisis in terms of changes to the usual recommended coarse of care were collected. RESULTS: A total of 181 patients with a median age 63 years were included in the cohort. In total, 31 patients had cervical cancer, 76 patients had endometrial cancer, 52 patients had ovarian or tubal cancer, 5 patients had a borderline tumor of the ovary, and 17 patients had vulvar cancer. During the study period, the care strategy was changed for 49 (27%) patients with postponed for 35 (19.3%) patients, and canceled for 7 (3.9%) patients. Surgical treatment was maintained for 139 (76.8%) patients. Management with neoadjuvant chemotherapy was offered to 19 (10,5%) patients and a change in surgical choice was made for 5 (2,8%) patients. In total, 8 (4,4%) patients tested positive for COVID-19. Data also shows a greater number of therapeutic changes in cases of ovarian cancer as well as a cancelation of a lumbo-aortic lymphadenectomy in one patient with cervical cancer. Hospital consultants estimated a direct detrimental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for 39 patients, representing 22% of gynecological cancers. CONCLUSION: This study provided observational data of the impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on the surgical management of gynecological cancers.","Jouen, Théo; Gauthier, Tristan; Azais, Henri; Bendifallah, Sofiane; Chauvet, Pauline; Fernandez, Herve; Kerbage, Yohan; Lavoue, Vincent; Lecointre, Lise; Mimoun, Camille; Ouldamer, Lobna; Seidler, Stéphanie; Siffert, Marc; Vallin, Anne-Lyse; Spiers, Andrew; Descamps, Philippe; Lacorre, Aymeline; Guillaume, Legendre",J Gynecol Obstet Hum Reprod,567,20

SARS-CoV-2 evolution is driven by the mechanisms at molecular and organism scales and regulated by the transmission pathways at the population scale. In this review, we show that infectivity-based natural selection was discovered as the mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission in July 2020. In April 2021, we proved beyond all doubt that such a natural selection via infectivity-based transmission pathway remained the sole mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 evolution. However, we reveal that antibody-disruptive co-mutations [Y449S, N501Y] debuted as a new vaccine-resistant transmission pathway of viral evolution in highly vaccinated populations a few months ago. Over one year ago, we foresaw that mutations spike protein RBD residues, 452 and 501, would""have high chances to mutate into significantly more infectious COVID-19 strains"". Mutations on these residues underpin prevailing SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Theta, Kappa, Lambda, and Mu at present and are expected to be vital to emerging variants. We anticipate that viral evolution will combine RBD co-mutations at these two sites, creating future variants that are tens of times more infectious than the original SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, two complementary transmission pathways of viral evolution: infectivity and vaccine-resistant, will prolong our battle with COVID-19 for years. We predict that RBD co-mutation [A411S, L452R, T478K], [L452R, T478K, N501Y], [L452R, T478K, E484K, N501Y], [K417N, L452R, T478K], and [P384L, K417N, E484K, N501Y] will have high chances to grow into dominating variants due to their high infectivity and/or strong ability to break through current vaccines, calling for the development of new vaccines and antibody therapies.","Chen, Jiahui; Wang, Rui; Wei, Guo-Wei",,567,26

The study aimed to examine the effectiveness of MATES in Energy general awareness training (GAT), and estimate the prevalence of recent suicidal ideation and exposure to suicidal behaviors in workers. A before and after design was used to examine the effectiveness of GAT training. Data were collected from 4887 participants undertaking GAT training at energy sites across Queensland, Australia. In total, 2% (97) of participants reported recent suicidal thoughts, 65% of participants reported they had known someone who had attempted suicide, and 69% had known someone who died by suicide. Significant improvements were found on all suicide literacy items after GAT training. Younger people were more likely to be positively affected by the intervention. The results indicate that the MATES in Energy program is successfully transitioning from the construction industry, and offers the first empirically supported suicide intervention tailored to the energy sector.","Ross, Victoria; Caton, Neil; Mathieu, Sharna; Gullestrup, Jorgen; Kõlves, Kairi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),567,29

The infection develops through contacts between contagious and exposed people, with a rate proportional to the number of contagious and of non-immune individuals, to contact duration and turnover, inversely proportional to the efficiency of protection measures, and balanced by the average individual recovery response. The obvious initial exponential increase is readily hindered by the growing recovery rate, and also by the size reduction of the exposed population. The system converges towards a stable attractor whose value is expressed in terms of the “reproductive rate” R0, depending on contamination and recovery factors. Various properties of the attractor are examined, and particularly its relations with R0. Decreasing this ratio below a critical value leads to a tipping threshold beyond which the epidemic is over. By contrast, significant values of the above ratio may bring the system through a bifurcating hierarchy of stable cycles up to a chaotic behaviour.","Louchet, François",Biology,567,18

Paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir (PRO) and/or dasabuvir (D), with or without ribavirin [PRO (D) ± ribavirin], which are direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), is the currently approved treatment regimen for CHC genotype 1; this regimen can also be used in patients with end-stage renal failure (ESRF). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of pretreatment factors on RVR in patients treated with PRO (D) ± ribavirin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 60 patients with CHC genotype 1 who were treated with PRO (D) ± ribavirin and achieved RVR. Patients' demographic data; baseline HCV RNA levels; HCV genotype information; biochemical, histologic, and radiologic results; and previous treatment history were recorded. Patients were categorized into two groups: virologic responses achieved in the first week (group 1) and in the first to the fourth week (group 2). Pretreatment factors were compared between the groups. RESULTS: Patients in group 1 who achieved ultraRVR (undetectable HCV RNA after 1 week of treatment) had significantly lower mean pretreatment HCV RNA levels and lower prevalence of ESRF than patients in group 2. CONCLUSIONS: RVR has been indicated to be a robust positive predictor of sustained virologic response. We concluded that some pretreatment factors such as low HCV RNA level and absence of ESRF might lead to faster RVR and shorter treatment duration with DAAs for CHC.","Turken, Melda; Kose, Sukran; Colak Ergun, Nadide; Tatar, Bengu",,567,16

It is unknown as to whether a history of Covid-19 prior to the vaccine and post-vaccine RBD-IgG levels are predictors of BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness against VOC-{delta} in nursing home residents. MethodsWe analyzed the data from two NHs that faced a VOC-{delta} outbreak in July-August 2021. These NHs had suffered prior Covid-19 outbreaks in 2020 and 2021. In many of the residents, RBD-IgG levels were measured 6 weeks after the second vaccine dose, i.e. 3 to 5 months before the VOC-{delta} outbreak onset, and again during the outbreak (SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay, Abbott Diagnostics). We compared residents with vs without prior Covid-19 for (i) VOC-{delta} incidence, (ii) the correlation between post-vaccine RBD-IgG levels and VOC-{delta} incidence, and (iii) the time-related change in RBD-IgG levels. ResultsAmong the 140 analyzed residents (58 to 101 years; 94 females, 46 men, mean age: 84.6 yr {+/-} 9.5 yr), one resident among the 44 with prior Covid-19 before vaccination developed a VOC-{delta} infection during the outbreak (1.3%) vs 55 of the 96 without Covid-19 prior to vaccination (57.3 %)(p<0.0001). The median value for RBD-IgG 6 weeks after the vaccine and during the outbreak was higher in residents with prior Covid-19 (31,553 AU/mL and 22,880 AU/mL) than in those without (1,050 AU/mL and 260 AU/mL)(p<0.0001). In residents without Covid-19 prior to vaccination, post-vaccination RDB-IgG levels did not predict protection against VOC-{delta} infection. ConclusionsIn contrary to residents with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, those without a history of Covid-19 before two BNT162b2 doses are not protected against VOC-{delta} infection and their RBD-Ig-G levels are low 3 to 5 months after vaccination. This suggests that a booster vaccine dose should be considered in this group of residents for a better protection against VOC-{delta} infection.","Blain, Hubert; TUAILLON, Edouard; Pisoni, Amandine; Soriteau, Laure; Million, Elodie; Leglise, Marie-Suzanne; Bussereau, Isabelle; Miot, Stephanie; Rolland, Yves; Picot, Marie-Christine; Bousquet, Jean J",,567,16

Vaccine development itself, however, will not be enough given that a sufficient amount of people will need to be vaccinated for widespread immunity. Vaccine hesitancy is on the rise, varies across countries, and is associated with conspiratorial worldview. Given the rise in COVID-19-related conspiracy theories, we aimed to examine the levels of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its association with beliefs on the origin of the novel coronavirus in a cross-cultural study. METHODS: We conducted an online survey in the UK (N = 1088) and Turkey (N = 3936), and gathered information on participants' willingness to vaccinate for a potential COVID-19 vaccine, beliefs on the origin of the novel coronavirus, and several behavioural and demographic predictors (such as anxiety, risk perception, government satisfaction levels) that influence vaccination and origin beliefs. RESULTS: In all, 31% of the participants in Turkey and 14% in the UK were unsure about getting themselves vaccinated for a COVID-19 vaccine. In both countries, 3% of the participants rejected to be vaccinated. Also, 54% of the participants in Turkey and 63% in the UK believed in the natural origin of the novel coronavirus. Believing in the natural origin significantly increased the odds of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. CONCLUSIONS: Our results point at a concerning level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, especially in Turkey, and suggest that wider communication of the scientific consensus on the origin of the novel coronavirus with the public may help future campaigns targeting COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.","Salali, Gul Deniz; Uysal, Mete Sefa",Psychol Med,567,16

The present study aimed to address this gap by examining transitions in six teachers’ identity construction from personal to online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from semi-structured interviews, self-reported practices, and group discussions. Data analyses indicated that the teachers’ identity transition was marked by six components: Subject-related instructional variation;tensions such as low agency, greater responsibility, and low professional preparation;emotional labour;conceptual change in becoming technophile teachers;(in)congruities in identity extension;and enhanced reflectivity. The study concludes with implications for teachers and policy-makers in developing various stakeholders’ awareness of technology adoption to facilitate the transition towards online instruction.

Millions of people are medically examined, and their data keep piling up awaiting classification. The data are typically both incomplete and heterogeneous which hampers classical classification algorithms. Some researchers have recently modified the popular KNN algorithm as a solution, where they handle incompleteness by imputation and heterogeneity by converting categorical data into numbers. In this article, we introduce a novel KNN variant (KNNV) algorithm that provides better results as demonstrated by thorough experimental work. We employ rough set theoretic techniques to handle both incompleteness and heterogeneity, as well as to find an ideal value for K. The KNNV algorithm takes an incomplete, heterogeneous dataset, containing medical records of people, and identifies those cases with COVID-19. We use in the process two popular distance metrics, Euclidean and Mahalanobis, in an effort to widen the operational scope. The KNNV algorithm is implemented and tested on a real dataset from the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology. The experimental results show that it can efficiently and accurately classify COVID-19 cases. It is also compared to three KNN derivatives. The comparison results show that it greatly outperforms all its competitors in terms of four metrics: precision, recall, accuracy, and F-Score. The algorithm given in this article can be easily applied to classify other diseases. Moreover, its methodology can be further extended to do general classification tasks outside the medical field.","Hamed, Ahmed; Sobhy, Ahmed; Nassar, Hamed",Arab J Sci Eng,567,1

The implications of the strategies implemented to prevent COVID-19 transmission on other infectious diseases are unclear. We aimed to appraise trends in the incidence of salmonellosis, shigellosis and campylobacteriosis in Israel during COVID-19 pandemic. Positive stool samples for Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter are reported on a monthly basis to the Israel Center for Disease Control from sentinel laboratories, within the framework of a surveillance network of bacterial culture-proven enteric diseases. Age-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 of shigellosis, salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis were calculated. Mean rates before and after the local onset of COVID-19 pandemic in Israel were compared and Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) was calculated. Joinpoint was used to evaluate secular trends. The mean age-adjusted incidence rate of shigellosis in March-July 2020 was lower than the rate observed in March-July 2018-2019 (RRR = 86.6%), but also decreased for salmonellosis (RRR = 33.0%) and campylobacteriosis (RRR = 30.0%). Using Joinpoint we have shown that the decrease observed for shigellosis was significantly sharper (Annual Percent Change (APC) = -77.7) between February 2020 and May 2020 than for salmonellosis (APC = -14.0) between July 2019 and April 2020 and for campylobacteriosis (APC = -1.1) between January 2018 and July 2020. The preventive measures applied to reduce transmission of COVID-19, including social distancing and hand washing, were ecologically associated with a decreased risk of bacterial enteric diseases in Israel. The association was strongest for shigellosis, a disease that is mostly person-to-person transmitted, as compared to salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis which are mostly foodborne transmitted.","Bassal, Ravit; Keinan-Boker, Lital; Cohen, Dani",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),567,1

In the psychiatric clinic of the University Medical Center Göttingen, students' ratings concerning the learning effect and their substantive assessment for both forms of teaching were comparatively evaluated to determine the quality of this process. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Overall, 350 students who had visited classroom teaching (winter semester, WS18/19 to WS19/20) vs. digital teaching (SS20) assessed their form of teaching post hoc, within a standardized survey. They rated the individual learning effect in seven psychiatric subjects and did a substantive assessment on eight dimensions. In addition, they rated their expenditure of time. RESULTS: For digital teaching, the individual learning effect was rated as either being equivalent or superior (subjects: psychotherapy, schizophrenia). Despite a significantly heightened expenditure of time, digital teaching was substantively assessed as being equivalent to classroom teaching or superior (dimensions: independent processing of learning goals, overall format of lecture). Concerning their anticipated preparation for the professional practice, students rated digital teaching as being inferior to classroom teaching. CONCLUSION: A pandemic-driven conversion from classroom to digital teaching did not result in a loss of quality on the dimensions measured in this comparative evaluation. With a view to professional practice, digital teaching should complement classroom teaching and be part of future curricula.","Besse, Matthias; Wiltfang, Jens; Belz, Michael; Signerski-Krieger, Jörg",Nervenarzt,567,26

Technologies based on ozone, a powerful oxidant, have been evaluated to inactivate this virus in aerosols and fomites. However, the high data diversity hinders the possibility of establishing a common ground for determining best practices for the use of these technologies. Furthermore, there is a lack of consensus regarding which are the main mechanisms of ozone virus inactivation. This critical review examined the most relevant information available regarding ozone application in gas-phase for different viruses inactivation (including recent publications dealing with SARS-CoV-2), and pointed towards envelope alteration as the main reaction pathway for enveloped viruses, such as is the case of SARS-CoV-2. It could also be concluded that gaseous ozone can be indeed an effective disinfectant, successfully inactivating viruses such us influenza A H1N1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 or even SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols or fomites. In reviewed works, low ozone exposures, just around 0.1-0.4 mg L-1 min, achieve about 4 log10 of inactivation in aerosols, while exposures between 1 and 4 mg L-1 min may be needed to guarantee an inactivation of 3-4 log10 in different fomites.

There is a concern that the pandemic will exacerbate the existing disparities in overall healthcare utilization and telehealth utilization. Few national studies have examined the changes in telehealth use during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data on 6.8 and 6.4 million employer-based health plan beneficiaries in 2020 and 2019, respectively, were collected in 2020. Unadjusted rates were compared both before and after the week of the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic as a national emergency. Trends in weekly utilization were also examined using a difference-in-differences regression framework to quantify the changes in telemedicine and office-based care utilization while controlling for the patient's demographic and county-level sociodemographic measures. All analyses were conducted in 2020. RESULTS: More than a 20-fold increase in the incidence of telemedicine utilization after March 13, 2020 was observed. Conversely, the incidence of office-based encounters declined by almost 50% and was not fully offset by the increase in telemedicine. The increase in telemedicine was greatest among patients in counties with low poverty levels (ß=31.70, 95% CI=15.17, 48.23), among patients in metropolitan areas (ß=40.60, 95% CI=30.86, 50.34), and among adults than among children aged 0-12 years (ß=57.91, 95% CI=50.32, 65.49). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected telehealth utilization disproportionately on the basis of patient age and both the county-level poverty rate and urbanicity.","Cantor, Jonathan H; McBain, Ryan K; Pera, Megan F; Bravata, Dena M; Whaley, Christopher M",Am. j. prev. med,567,15

Beyond the immediate delay a backlog for future patients is expected. Such delays can lead to disease progression. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop guidance on criteria for prioritization for surgery and reconfiguring management pathways for non-metastatic stage of prostate cancer who opt for surgical treatment. A second aim was to identify the infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to achieve low likelihood of COVID-19 hazard if radical prostatectomy was to be carried out during the outbreak and whilst the disease is endemic. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: An accelerated consensus process and systematic review. We conducted a systematic review of the evidence on COVID-19 and reviewed international guidance on prostate cancer. These were presented to an international prostate cancer expert panel (n=34) through an online meeting. The consensus process underwent three rounds of survey in total. Additions to the second- and third-round surveys were formulated based on the answers and comments from the previous rounds. OUTCOME MEASURES: Consensus opinion was defined as &#8805;80% agreement, which were used to reconfigure the prostate cancer pathways. RESULTS: Evidence on the delayed management of patients with prostate cancer is scarce. There was 100% agreement that prostate cancer pathways should be reconfigured and develop measures to prevent nosocomial COVID-19 for patients treated surgically. Consensus was reached on prioritization criteria of patients for surgery and management pathways for those who have delayed treatment. IPC measures to achieve a low likelihood of nosocomial COVID-19 were coined as ""COVID-19 cold sites"". CONCLUSION: Re-configuring management pathways for prostate cancer patients is recommended if significant delay (>3-6 months) in surgical management is unavoidable. The mapped pathways provide guidance for such patients. The IPC processes proposed provide a framework for providing radical prostatectomy within an environment with low COVID-19 risk during the outbreak or when the disease remains endemic. The broader concepts could be adapted to other indications beyond prostate cancer surgery.","Tandogdu, Zafer; Collins, Justin; Shaw, Greg; Rohn, Jenifer; Koves, Bela; Sachdeva, Ashwin; Ghazi, Ahmed; Haese, Alexander; Mottrie, Alex; Kumar, Anup; Sivaraman, Ananthakrishnan; Tewari, Ashutosh; Challacombe, Benjamin; Rocco, Bernardo; Giedelman, Camilo; Wagner, Christian; Rogers, Craig G; Murphy, Declan G; Pushkar, Dmitry; Ogaya-Pinies, Gabriel; Porter, Jim; Ramesh Seetharam, Kulthe; Graefen, Markus; Orvieto, Marcelo A; Covas Moschovas, Marcio; Schatloff, Oscar; Wiklund, Peter; Coelho, Rafael; Valero, Rair; de Reijke, Theo M; Ahlering, Thomas; Rogers, Travis; van der Poel, Henk G; Patel, Vipul; Artibani, Walter; Wagenlehner, Florian; Nathan, Senthil; Erik Bjerklund Johansens, Truls; Hawkey, Peter; Kelly, John",BJU int,567,2

Malaysia implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) on 18 March 2020 when the cumulative COVID-19 cases were still below 800. Since then, MCO was extended several times and the latest phase of Recovery MCO (RMCO) will last until 31 August 2020. As seafood represents an important protein source, the aquaculture sector supports the livelihood of coastal communities in Malaysia, particularly those involved in micro- and small-scale fish farming activities. The emergence and spread of this pandemic severely disrupt market demand and supply chains of seafood industries. Therefore, this case report looks into the potential impacts of COVID-19 on the aquaculture sector of Malaysia. Then, the coping strategies implemented by Malaysia are highlighted and their potential effectiveness is discussed. Also, some useful recommendations are suggested to ensure the continuity and growth of the aquaculture sector.

Many efforts aimed at deriving effective Mpro inhibitors are currently underway, including an international open-science discovery project, codenamed COVID Moonshot. As part of COVID Moonshot, we used saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance (STD-NMR) spectroscopy to assess the binding of putative Mpro ligands to the viral protease, including molecules identified by crystallographic fragment screening and novel compounds designed as Mpro inhibitors. In this manner, we aimed to complement enzymatic activity assays of Mpro performed by other groups with information on ligand affinity. We have made the Mpro STD-NMR data publicly available.

Here we describe a novel case of hirudotherapy in an intubated patient with macroglossia related to oral trauma and venous congestion. The patient was a 23-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity initially admitted to an outside hospital with acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. She received early treatment with supplemental oxygen, dexamethasone, remdesivir, and tocilizumab but developed worsening respiratory failure requiring intubation on hospital day 13. Despite neuromuscular blockade and proning, she remained difficult to oxygenate and was transferred to our hospital 24 days after admission. Weaning of pharmacologic paralysis was complicated by ongoing ventilator dyssynchrony, and she continued to require deep sedation with multiple agents, including phenobarbital. Her respiratory status gradually improved, but weaning of sedation was marked by agitation and tongue biting. On day 50, significant isolated tongue edema was noted. Further trauma was observed on the ventral aspect of the swollen tongue where it came into contact with the teeth. High-level ventilatory support precluded tracheostomy, and conservative management with repositioning of the endotracheal tube and insertion of a bite block did not resolve the edema. The otolaryngology service was consulted, and the decision was made to trial an application of medicinal leeches. The patient received two courses of hirudotherapy with packing of the oropharynx to prevent leech migration, resulting in significant improvement of her edema. Among already mechanically ventilated patients, macroglossia remains a rare but documented complication. Endotracheal tube position and proning are the most frequently implicated etiologies. In this instance, oral trauma from tongue-biting coupled with impaired lymphovascular return from extrinsic impingement on the swollen tongue were thought to be the cause. Therapeutic options are limited and include ice, elevation, bite block placement, intravenous steroids, manual reduction and compression wrapping. In extreme cases, tracheostomy and even partial glossectomy have been performed. Hirudotherapy is well described in modern clinical practice among facial reconstructive surgeons for the management of venous congestion and resultant compromise of pedicle or microvascular tissue-free transfer flaps. Few case reports in the trauma literature have described its use with macroglossia on presentation, but its use in cases of post-intubation trauma appears novel. Given the frequent contribution of venous congestion in intubated patients with macroglossia, hirudotherapy should be considered a logical treatment modality in cases where conservative measures are unsuccessful.","Wilkinson, J.; Drolen, C.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 102 patients with severe COVID-19 infections. The patients were divided into a survival group (n=73) and a non-survival group (n=29) according to their prognosis. The age, sex, underlying diseases, clinical laboratory data within 48h (routine blood tests, ALT, AST, TBIL, ALB, BUN, CR, D-Dimer, PT, APTT, FIB, F VIII:C, CK-MB, CK, and LDH), and ventilation status were collected. The organ functions of these severe COVID-19 patients were assessed by comparing the differences between the two groups. RESULTS: AST, BUN, CR, CK-MB, LDH, and CK in the non-survival group were higher than those in the survival group, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). D-Dimer, PT, FIB, and F VIII:C in the non-survival group were higher than the values observed in the survival group, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). PLT, AST, BUN, CR, D-Dimer, PT, FIB, F VIII:C, CK-MB, CK, and LDH predicted the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the COVID19 endpoint events and were 0.721, 0.854, 0.867, 0.757, 0.699, 0.679, 0.715, 0.811, 0.935, and 0.802, respectively.

SGB may be present in up to 40% of reflux symptoms in PPI-refractory GERD. Most reports on SGB have come from Western countries, and little is known about the prevalence and relevance of SGB in Asian refractory GERD patients. This study aimed at comparing the role of SGB in GERD patients in Japan and the UK. METHODS: We re-analyzed impedance-pH monitoring tracings from patients who were referred to tertiary centers in Japan and the UK due to PPI-refractory reflux symptoms. The prevalence of excessive SGB and the impact of SGB on reflux symptoms were compared between the two countries. RESULTS: Impedance-pH tracings from124 Japanese and 83 British patients were re-analyzed. Japanese patients were significantly younger and had smaller body mass index than the British (P < 0.001). Japanese patients had significantly lower prevalence of excessive SGB (18.5%) than the UK (36.1%) irrespective of reflux phenotype (P = 0.006). Logistic regression analysis showed that the geographical/cultural difference was the only factor associated with the different prevalence of SGB (odds ratio; 2.91, 95% CI 1.09-7.73, P = 0.032). SGB were related to typical reflux symptoms very rarely in Japan [0% (0-4.9)] compared to the UK [35% (0-54.1)] (P = 0.071). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of SGB and their impact on reflux symptoms is significantly lower in Japan compared to the UK. The difference is not related to reflux parameters but might come from ethnic/cultural factors to be further characterized.","Sawada, Akinari; Itami, Hideaki; Nakagawa, Kenichiro; Hirano, Shinji; Kitamura, Hiroyuki; Nakata, Rieko; Takashima, Shingo; Abe, Yasuaki; Saito, Masahiro; Yazaki, Etsuro; Kawamura, Osamu; Tanaka, Fumio; Takeuchi, Toshihisa; Koike, Tomoyuki; Masamune, Atsushi; Fujiwara, Yasuhiro; Higuchi, Kazuhide; Sifrim, Daniel",J. gastroenterol,567,19

Estimates of R0 at the beginning of the epidemic were 3.27 (95% CI, 3.02-3.54) and 3.78 (95% CI, 3.49-4.09) respectively for serial intervals of 5 and 6 days; and when quarantine started, with the reported asymptomatic ratio 0.505, R0 rose to 4.18 (95%CI, 3.86-4.52) and 4.73 (95%CI, 4.37-5.12) respectively for passengers who might be exposed to the virus due to pre/asymptomatic crew.

Daily inpatient antimicrobial therapy is an alternative to hospitalization, which is similar to OPAT; patients go home after they are administered antibiotics in a separate room in the hospital setting. OBJECTIVES: We assessed our previous daily inpatient practice to revitalize the model in the COVID-19 era. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical and microbiological responses and the cost effectiveness of the patients with cUTIs who received daily inpatient ertapenem therapy. RESULTS: Our study population was 136 patients in 156 episodes. It was a difficult-to-treat group with older age (mean 63.0 ± 14.8 years) and a high burden of underlying conditions (86.5%). The most common causative organisms were Escherichia coli (74.4%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.2%); 89.7% of the isolates were producing extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL). The microbiologic and clinical success rates were 82.1% and 95.5%, respectively. The patients required hospitalization in 16 episodes (10.2%) because of clinical failures (3.8%), superinfections (2%), planned invasive interventions (3.2%), and side effects (1.2%).

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the context of practice and the option of returning home for cervical ripening may now assume greater significance. This work aimed to examine whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed practice around IOL in the UK. METHOD: We used an online questionnaire to survey senior obstetricians and midwives at all 156 UK NHS Trusts and Boards that currently offer maternity services. Responses were analysed to produce descriptive statistics, with free text responses analysed using a conventional content analysis approach. FINDINGS: Responses were received from 92 of 156 UK Trusts and Boards, a 59% response rate. Many Trusts and Boards reported no change to their IOL practice, however 23% reported change in methods used for cervical ripening; 28% a change in criteria for home cervical ripening; 28% stated that more women were returning home during cervical ripening; and 24% noted changes to women's response to recommendations for IOL. Much of the change was reported as happening in response to attempts to minimise hospital attendance and restrictions on birth partners accompanying women. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has changed practice around induction of labour, although this varied significantly between NHS Trusts and Boards. There is a lack of formal evidence to support decision-making around outpatient cervical ripening: the basis on which changes were implemented and what evidence was used to inform decisions is not clear.","Harkness, M; Yuill, C; Cheyne, H; Stock, S J; McCourt, C",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,567,10

Its causative agent, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been the subject of an unprecedented investigation to characterize its molecular structure and intimate functioning. While markers for its detection have been proposed and several diagnostic methodologies developed, its propensity to evolve and evade diagnostic tools and the immune response is of great concern. The recent spread of new variants with increased infectivity requires even more attention. Here, we document how shotgun proteomics can be useful for rapidly monitoring the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We evaluated the heterogeneity of purified SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained after culturing in the Vero E6 cell line. We found that cell culture induces significant changes that are translated at the protein level, such changes being detectable by tandem mass spectrometry. Production of viral particles requires careful quality control which can be easily performed by shotgun proteomics. Although considered relatively stable so far, the SARS-CoV-2 genome turns out to be prone to frequent variations. Therefore, the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 variants from patients reporting only the consensus genome after its amplification would deserve more attention and could benefit from more in-depth analysis of low level but crystal-clear signals, as well as complementary and rapid analysis by shotgun proteomics.","Gallais, Fabrice; Pible, Olivier; Gaillard, Jean-Charles; Debroas, Stéphanie; Batina, Hélène; Ruat, Sylvie; Sandron, Florian; Delafoy, Damien; Gerber, Zuzana; Olaso, Robert; Gas, Fabienne; Bellanger, Laurent; Deleuze, Jean-François; Grenga, Lucia; Armengaud, Jean",Anal. bioanal. chem,567,5

This work aimed to develop a new high-throughput isolation strategy using novel technologies for rapid and automated isolation of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We used an automated microscope based on high-content screening (HCS), and we applied specific image analysis algorithms targeting cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6 cells. A randomized panel of 104 samples, including 72 that tested positive by RT-PCR and 32 that tested negative, were processed with our HCS strategy and were compared with the classical isolation procedure. RESULTS: The isolation rate was 43% (31/72) with both strategies on RT-PCR-positive samples and was correlated with the initial RNA viral load in the samples, in which we obtained a positivity threshold of 27 Ct. Co-culture delays were shorter with the HCS strategy, where 80% (25/31) of the positive samples were recovered by the third day of co-culture, compared with only 26% (8/30) with the classic strategy. Moreover, only the HCS strategy allowed us to recover all the positive samples (31 with HCS versus 27 with classic strategy) after 1 week of co-culture. CONCLUSIONS: This system allows the rapid and automated screening of clinical samples with minimal operator workload, which reduces the risk of contamination and paves the way for future applications in clinical microbiology, such as large-scale drug susceptibility testing.","Francis, Rania; Le Bideau, Marion; Jardot, Priscilla; Grimaldier, Clio; Raoult, Didier; Bou Khalil, Jacques Yaacoub; La Scola, Bernard",Clin. microbiol. infect,567,15

Common product claims such as ""antiviral"" and ""antimicrobial"" can be attractive to buyers seeking to protect themselves from this respiratory disease, but it is important to note that filtration capabilities are the main factor to prevent virus transmission and that antimicrobial ability is a secondary protection factor. Silver has long been known to be antibacterial, and growing research supports additional antiviral properties. In this study, 40 masks claiming to contain silver were evaluated for substantiated antiviral and antimicrobial claims using methods available to the public. Criteria for determining the validity of substantiated claims included the use of patented technology, international certification for antimicrobial and/or antiviral textile by ISO or ASTM, EPA pesticide registration, and peer-reviewed literature. Our analysis showed that, of the 40 masks, 21 had substantiated claims. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), two of the substantiated face masks (A and B) were examined for silver identification for further confirmation. Mask A uses silver and copper ions attached to zeolite particles;the zeolite particles discovered through SEM were approximately 90–200 nm in diameter. In mask B, particles of silver and titanium at the 250 nm size were found. In conclusion, these certifications or patents are not enough to determine credibility, and stricter regulations by federal agencies on product testing for manufacturers that make claims are necessary to ensure the efficacy of the product advertised, as well as a cloth face mask inhalation standard.

To investigate if shifts in types of accidents or injuries occurred, especially regarding non-accidental injuries. DesignRetrospective observational multicenter study. Setting37 German PICUs. Patients1444 children and adolescents < 18 years admitted to German PICUs due to trauma or injuries during the first German lockdown period (16.3.-31.5.2020) and during the same periods of the years 2017-2019. InterventionsNone. Measurements and main resultsStandardized morbidity ratios (SMR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for the severity of disease, admission reasons, types of accidents, injury patterns, surgeries and procedures, and outcomes. Disease severity did not differ from previous years. We found an increase in ingestions (SMR 1.41 (CI 0.88 - 2.16)) and a decrease in aspirations (0.77 (0.41 - 1.32)) and burns (0.82 (0.59 - 1.12)). The total number of admissions for trauma remained constant, but traffic accidents (0.76 (0.56 - 1.01) and school/kindergarten accidents (0.25 (0.05 - 0.74) decreased. Household (1.32 (1.05 - 1.64)) and leisure accidents (1.32 (1.05 - 1.65)) increased. Injured structures did not change, but less neurosurgeries (0.69 (0.42 - 1.07)) and more visceral surgeries (2.00 (1.14 - 3.24)) were performed. Non-accidental non-suicidal injuries declined (0.85 (0.50 - 1.37)). Suicide attempts increased in adolescent boys (1.57 (0.58 - 3.42)), while there was a decrease in adolescent girls (0.86 (0.53 - 1.31)). ConclusionsOur study showed shifts in trauma types and associated surgeries during the lockdown period that are generally in line with current literature. The decreased number of non-accidental non-suicidal injuries we observed does not suggest a fundamental increase in severe child abuse during the lockdown period. The decrease in suicide attempts among adolescent girls confirms previous findings, while the increase among boys has not been described yet and deserves further investigation.","Bruns, Nora; Willemsen, Lea Yvonne; Holtkamp, Katharina; Kamp, Oliver; Dudda, Marcel; Kowall, Bernd; Stang, Andreas; Hey, Florian; Blankenburg, Judith; Sabir, Hemmen; Eifinger, Frank; Fuchs, Hans; Haase, Roland; Andree, Clemens; Heldmann, Michael; Potratz, Jenny; Kurz, Daniel; Schumann, Anja; Mueller-Knapp, Merle; Mand, Nadine; Doerfel, Claus; Dahlem, Peter; Rothoeft, Tobias; Ohlert, Manuel; Silkenbaeumer, Katrin; Dohle, Frank; Indraswari, Fithri; Niemann, Frank; Jahn, Peter; Merker, Michael; Braun, Nicole; Nunez, Francisco Brevis; Engler, Matthias; Heimann, Konrad; Wolf, Gerhard; Wulf, Dominik; Holborn, Claudia; Freymann, Holger; Allgaier, Nicolas; Knirsch, Felix; Dercks, Martin; Reinhard, Julia; Hoppenz, Marc; Felderhoff-Mueser, Ursula; Dohna-Schwake, Christian",,567,24

However, it is unknown whether the evolution of selfing commonly precedes the evolution of annuality, or vice versa. Using a 2-year common garden experiment, we asked if the evolution of selfing in the normally perennial Arabidopsis lyrata was accompanied by a shift towards the annual habit. Despite their very recent divergence from obligately outcrossing populations, selfing plants exhibited a 39% decrease in over-winter survival after the first year compared with outcrossing plants. Our data ruled out the most obvious underlying mechanism: differences in reproductive investment in the first year did not explain differences in survival. We conclude that transitions to selfing in perennial A. lyrata may be accompanied by a shift towards annuality, but drivers of the process require further investigation.","Gorman, Courtney E; Steinecke, Christina; van Kleunen, Mark; Dorken, Marcel E; Stift, Marc",Biol Lett,567,30

Public health authorities play a primary role in managing this information. However, individuals have to apply critical health literacy to evaluate it. The objective of this paper is to identify targets for strengthening critical health literacy by focusing on the field of argumentation theory. This paper is based on the textual analysis of instances of health information through the lens of argumentation theory. The results show that critical health literacy benefits from: (1) understanding the concept of argument and the supporting reasons, (2) identifying the main argument schemes, and (3) the knowledge and use of the main critical questions to check the soundness of arguments. This study operationalizes the main aspects of critical health literacy. It calls for specific educational and training initiatives in the field. Moreover, it argues in favor of broadening the current educational curricula to empower individuals to engage in informed and quality decision making. Strengthening individuals' critical health literacy involves interventions to empower in argument evaluation. For this purpose, argumentation theory has analytical and normative frameworks that can be adapted within a lay-audience education concept.","Rubinelli, Sara; Ort, Alexander; Zanini, Claudia; Fiordelli, Maddalena; Diviani, Nicola",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),567,16

CEP was potent to reverse most dysregulated genes and pathways in infected cells including ER stress/unfolded protein response and HSF1-mediated heat shock response. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomes also confirmed that genes of cellular stress responses and autophagy pathways were enriched in several peripheral blood mononuclear cells populations from COVID-19 patients.

Patients undergoing surgery for secondary peritonitis during the first COVID-19 surge in Italy (March 23-May 4, 2020-COVID period group) were compared with patients who underwent surgery during the same time interval of year 2019 (no-COVID period group). The primary endpoint was the development of postoperative complications. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors of complications. Of the 332 patients studied, 149 were in the COVID period group and 183 were in the no-COVID period group. Patients in the COVID period group had an increased frequency of late presentations to the emergency departments (43% vs. 31.1%; P = 0.026) and a higher rate of postoperative complications (35.6% vs. 18%; P < 0.001). The same results were found in the subset analysis of patients with severe peritonitis at surgical exploration. The ASA score, severity of peritonitis, qSOFA score, diagnosis other than appendicitis, and COVID period resulted independent predictors of complications.

We aimed to describe the practice of ventilation management and to establish outcomes in invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19 in a single country during the first month of the outbreak. METHODS: PRoVENT-COVID is a national, multicentre, retrospective observational study done at 18 intensive care units (ICUs) in the Netherlands. Consecutive patients aged at least 18 years were eligible for participation if they had received invasive ventilation for COVID-19 at a participating ICU during the first month of the national outbreak in the Netherlands. The primary outcome was a combination of ventilator variables and parameters over the first 4 calendar days of ventilation: tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), respiratory system compliance, and driving pressure. Secondary outcomes included the use of adjunctive treatments for refractory hypoxaemia and ICU complications. Patient-centred outcomes were ventilator-free days at day 28, duration of ventilation, duration of ICU and hospital stay, and mortality. PRoVENT-COVID is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04346342). FINDINGS: Between March 1 and April 1, 2020, 553 patients were included in the study. Median tidal volume was 6·3 mL/kg predicted bodyweight (IQR 5·7-7·1), PEEP was 14·0 cm H2O (IQR 11·0-15·0), and driving pressure was 14·0 cm H2O (11·2-16·0). Median respiratory system compliance was 31·9 mL/cm H2O (26·0-39·9). Of the adjunctive treatments for refractory hypoxaemia, prone positioning was most often used in the first 4 days of ventilation (283 [53%] of 530 patients). The median number of ventilator-free days at day 28 was 0 (IQR 0-15); 186 (35%) of 530 patients had died by day 28. Predictors of 28-day mortality were gender, age, tidal volume, respiratory system compliance, arterial pH, and heart rate on the first day of invasive ventilation. INTERPRETATION: In patients with COVID-19 who were invasively ventilated during the first month of the outbreak in the Netherlands, lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volume and low driving pressure was broadly applied and prone positioning was often used. The applied PEEP varied widely, despite an invariably low respiratory system compliance. The findings of this national study provide a basis for new hypotheses and sample size calculations for future trials of invasive ventilation for COVID-19. These data could also help in the interpretation of findings from other studies of ventilation practice and outcomes in invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19.

In the wake of the pandemic, the health and socio-economic challenges experienced by the youth in Kenya are likely to be elevated. We assessed knowledge, practices, perceived risk of infection, adoption of recommended behaviour and the effects of COVID-19 among the youth in Kenya. METHODS: A cross sectional descriptive study was conducted between April 30th to May 7th, 2020 through a combined online survey and phone interviews. A total of 2156 youth across all 47 counties in Kenya completed the responses to the study questions. All survey responses analyzed using Stata version 15 were tabulated by gender, age, and education level to generate basic descriptive tables and tested for differences by category using chi-square tests. Where applicable, linear and logistic regression analysis model was conducted using covariates such as employment status, gender, and education level. RESULTS: Knowledge on symptoms of COVID-19 was generally high. Female respondents were more likely to identify more symptoms correctly compared to men (p < 0.001). However, youth reported very low levels of anyone being at risk of infection (7.1%). Most youth have adopted behavior necessary to slow down the infection. There were generally very low reported levels of inability to access health services related to sexual and reproductive health. About 50.0% of respondents reported significant decline in income during the pandemic period, nearly a third reported living in fear while 26.5% reported feeling stressed. CONCLUSION: There was high knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, preventive strategies, and high adoption of preventive practices. Strategies to sustain behaviors positively adopted among young people will be critical to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Despite the low reported rates of inability to access sexual and reproductive health, response measures should include strategies that facilitate continuity of services among young people. The reported social effects of the pandemic show the need for interventions to meet the health and socio-economic needs of the youth and minimize the long-term consequences of the pandemic.","Karijo, Evalin; Wamugi, Sylvia; Lemanyishoe, Samuel; Njuki, Jenny; Boit, Faith; Kibui, Vania; Karanja, Sarah; Abuya, Timothy",BMC Public Health,567,26

This current review provides insights on how individuals, communities, and specific populations, such as healthcare workers and patients are leveraging pre-COVID-19 and peri-COVID-19 factors to reinforce their psychological resilience during the global public health crisis. RECENT FINDINGS: Examination of the extant literature indicated that populations around the world rely often on support from their loved-ones, closed significant others, outdoor and physical activities, and spirituality to cope with the COVID-19-related distress. Increased sense of meaning/purpose since the COVID-19 pandemic was also reported. SUMMARY: A portion of publications provided intervention models to reinforce resilience among specific populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, it is not convincing that some of these models can be applied universally.

To counter the threats driven by dominant tourism growth models, a number of tourism scholars have called for revisiting the philosophical foundation upon which tourism activities are developed. Informed by debates in philosophy and the wider social sciences, including tourism scholarship, this conceptual paper, therefore, suggests an alternative governance paradigm for tourism destinations, which is articulated in four propositions that reflect a new materialist perspective. These propositions are a monist post-anthropocentric ontology, a participatory epistemology, resilient forms of tourism and participation as methodologies, and social eudaimonia as societal value. The core argument presented in this paper is that the Anthropocene requires tourism destinations to espouse alternative governance approaches drawing from ideas emerging from new materialist scholarship. © 2021 The Author(s).

From this shift, several changes in the teaching paradigm derived, in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have an impact in academic professional's mental health. In the present work we show the application of a modified version of the adapted COVID-19 stress scales (ACSS) which also included teaching anxiety and preparedness, and resilience for academic professionals in Mexico. These scales were applied during the unprecedented transformation of the education system undergone in the COVID-19 quarantine. Most of the studied variables: gender, age, academic degree, household occupants, having a disease, teaching level, teaching mode, work hours, resilience, teaching anxiety and preparedness, and fear of being an asymptomatic patient (FOBAP), showed significant statistical correlation between each other (p < 0.050) and to the 6 areas of the ACSS (danger, contamination, social economical, xenophobia, traumatic stress, and compulsive checking). Our results further showed that the perceived stress and anxiety fell into the category of Absent to Mild, with only the danger section of the ACSS falling into the Moderate category. Finally, the resilience generated throughout the quarantine was very high, which seems to be a predictor of adaptation the academic professional has undergone to cope with stress.","Delgado-Gallegos, Juan Luis; Padilla-Rivas, Gerardo R.; Zuñiga-Violante, Erika; Avilés-Rodriguez, Gener; Arellanos-Soto, Daniel; Villareal, Hector Franco; Cosío-León, María de los Ángeles; Romo-Cardenas, Gerardo Salvador; Islas, Jose Francisco",Front Public Health,567,8

Pathogen-specific antibodies are typically a major predictor of protective immunity, yet B cell and antibody responses during COVID-19 are not fully understood. Here, we analyzed antibody-secreting cell (ASC) and antibody responses in twenty hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The patients exhibited typical symptoms of COVID-19, and presented with reduced lymphocyte numbers and increased T cell and B cell activation. Importantly, we detected an expansion of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-specific ASCs in all twenty COVID-19 patients using a multicolor FluoroSpot assay. Out of the 20 patients, 16 had developed SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies by the time of inclusion in the study. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA, IgG and IgM antibody levels positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody titers, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels may reflect the titers of neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 patients during the acute phase of infection. Lastly, we showed that interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were higher in serum of patients who were hospitalized for longer, supporting the recent observations that IL-6 and CRP could be used to predict COVID-19 severity.

It is purported that socioeconomic factors may drive this association, but data supporting this assertion are sparse. Objectives: To evaluate whether socioeconomic factors mediate the association of race/ethnicity with COVID-19 incidence and outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults tested for (cohort 1) or hospitalized with (cohort 2) COVID-19 between March 1, 2020, and July 23, 2020, at the University of Miami Hospital and Clinics. Our primary exposure was race/ethnicity. We considered socioeconomic factors as potential mediators of our exposure’s association with outcomes. We used standard statistics to describe our cohorts and multivariable regression modeling to identify associations of race/ethnicity with our primary outcomes, one for each cohort, of test positivity (cohort 1) and hospital mortality (cohort 2). We performed a mediation analysis to see whether household income, population density, and household size mediated the association of race/ethnicity with outcomes. Results: Our cohorts included 15,473 patients tested (29.0% non-Hispanic White, 48.1% Hispanic White, 15.0% non-Hispanic Black, 1.7% Hispanic Black, and 1.6% other) and 295 patients hospitalized (9.2% non-Hispanic White, 56.9% Hispanic White, 21.4% non-Hispanic Black, 2.4% Hispanic Black, and 10.2% other). Among those tested, 1,256 patients (8.1%) tested positive, and, of the hospitalized patients, 47 (15.9%) died. After adjustment for demographics, race/ethnicity was associated with test positivity—odds-ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]) versus non-Hispanic White for Non-Hispanic Black: 3.21 (2.60–3.96), Hispanic White: 2.72 (2.28–3.26), and Hispanic Black: 3.55 (2.33–5.28).

As the COVID-19 outbreak has spread across the globe, it has brought significant changes to college campuses worldwide. College students have been heavily affected by the closure, as online learning has become increasingly common in higher education institutions. Using data collected from college students in South Korea and Taiwan in the spring of 2020, this study examines the effects of pandemic-related lifestyle changes on mental health conditions for college students in the two countries. The results were 3-fold. First, compared to college students in Taiwan, college students in South Korea reported greater decreases in time spent traveling, being with friends, eating at restaurants, and engaging in part-time employment, and greater increases in online shopping and ordering food for delivery. Second, college students in South Korea reported a higher level of worry, a greater possibility of contact with a person with COVID-19, and a lower level of happiness than did college students in Taiwan. Third, our findings indicate that social activities, including spending time with friends, were positively correlated with mental health conditions in South Korea and Taiwan. Comparing Korean and Taiwanese students' lifestyle changes and mental health conditions amid the pandemic, the study argues that the decrease in socialization and interaction under these new circumstances may be a significant factor that explains an increase in mental health issues in Korean college students compared to Taiwanese students, given the increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Korea and the corresponding greater use of online teaching platforms there than in Taiwan.","Chen, Wei-Lin; Song, Sue-Yeon; Yap, Ko-Hua",Front Public Health,567,16

Misconceptions and stigmatization towards the use of face masks may hinder the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic. We address this previous debate by analyzing the advice on the community use of masks across different credible health authorities: countries that promoted the use of masks acknowledged that masks are effective, but also explained the importance of their proper use along with other hygiene measures. In contrast, authorities that recommended against the community use of masks mainly cited shortage of supplies, the argument that the public do not have the adequate skills to wear them, or that wearing masks might reduce compliance with other important behaviors. We suggest promoting effective behavioral changes in personal protective measures by teaching microbiological knowledge instead of just listing out the “dos-and-don’ts”.","Tso, Ricky V; Cowling, Benjamin J",Clin Infect Dis,567,20

Methods: All consecutive CTPA with positive PE in COVID-19 patients from University Hospital Split, from March 23, 2020 to January 31, 2021 were analyzed. Baseline data were collected from patient’s electronic records. CTPA scan analysis identified PE anatomical location (i.e., main, lobar, segmental, or subsegmental). Results: A total number of 78 positive CTPA in COVID-19 patients was mainly in elderly with several co-morbidities, high D-dimer levels, at median of 14 days. CTPAs showed involvement of the entire pulmonary artery tree, mainly of the small-to medium diameter pulmonary artery branches, unilaterally (n = 31, 39,74%), and bilaterally (n = 33, 42.31%). The large-diameter branches were the most rarely affected as a single location (n = 14, 17.95%). Conclusion: PE occurred in predominantly elderly people, having several comorbidities, and high D-dimer levels. Embolic involvement of pulmonary branches of all sizes were found, the most frequent of small to medium diameter branches. Further investigation is needed to better understand mechanisms and course of the COVID-19 related PE.","Budimir Mršić, Danijela; Perković-Tabak, Lara; Ćavar, Marija; Luetić, Ante; Petričević, Mate; Dolić, Krešimir",Gerontol Geriatr Med,567,21

The structure of this tissue varies according to species and age. AIM: The aim of this study was to describe the possible age-related structural variation of the BALT of the one humped camel. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fresh specimens from both lungs of 15 clinically healthy male camels (10 months–12 years) were studied with light and electron microscopes. RESULTS: The BALT in the camel was variable from few lymphocytes to well-organized lymphoid tissue with a clear germinal center. The BALT of the bronchi is a constant lymphoid tissue in young and adult camels which may be of the large size with clear germinal center in response to repeated immune reaction and involutes in old age. The BALT of the bronchioles may be induced and develops mainly due to an immune reaction and showed great morphological variations and observed in different ages. High endothelial venules were associated with BALT in the bronchi but not with that of the bronchioles. The BALT-associated epithelium was tall pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium with goblet cells in the extrapulmonary bronchi changed to pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium mucous secreting cells in the intrapulmonary bronchi and simple columnar ciliated to simple cuboidal epithelium with Clara cells without goblet cells or mucous secreting cells in the bronchioles. CONCLUSIONS: The BALT of the bronchi is a constant lymphoid tissue in young and adult camels and involutes in old age. The BALT of the bronchioles may be induced and develops mainly due to an immune reaction and observed in different ages.,"Elhussieny, Omnya; Zidan, Mohamed",Trop Anim Health Prod,567,1

Using full-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, scientists have identified three clades and multiple lineages of MERS-CoV in humans and the zoonotic host, dromedary camels. In this study, we have characterized eight MERS-CoV isolates collected from patients in Saudi Arabia in 2015. We have performed full-genome sequencing on the viral isolates, and compared them to the corresponding clinical specimens. All isolates were clade B, lineages 4 and 5. Three of the isolates carry deletions located on three independent regions of the genome in the 5′UTR, ORF1a and ORF3. All novel MERS-CoV strains replicated efficiently in Vero and Huh7 cells. Viruses with deletions in the 5′UTR and ORF1a exhibited impaired viral release in Vero cells. These data emphasize the plasticity of the MERS-CoV genome during human infection.","Tamin, Azaibi; Queen, Krista; Paden, Clinton R.; Lu, Xiaoyan; Andres, Erica; Sakthivel, Senthilkumar K.; Li, Yan; Tao, Ying; Zhang, Jing; Kamili, Shifaq; Assiri, Abdullah M.; Alshareef, Ali; Alaifan, Taghreed A.; Altamimi, Asmaa M.; Jokhdar, Hani; Watson, John T.; Gerber, Susan I.; Tong, Suxiang; Thornburg, Natalie J.",Journal of General Virology,567,1

While the rest of the world struggles to control COVID-19, China has managed to control the pandemic rapidly and effectively with strong lockdown policies. This study investigates the change in air pollution (focusing on the air quality index (AQI), six ambient air pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), ozone (O(3)), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters ≤10 μm (PM(10)) and ≤2.5 μm (PM(2.5))) patterns for three periods: pre-COVID (from 1 January to May 30, 2019), active COVID (from 1 January to May 30, 2020) and post-COVID (from 1 January to May 30, 2021) in the Jiangsu province of China. Our findings reveal that the change in air pollution from pre-COVID to active COVID was greater than in previous years due to the government's lockdown policies. Post-COVID, air pollutant concentration is increasing. Mean change PM(2.5) from pre-COVID to active COVID decreased by 18%; post-COVID it has only decreased by 2%. PM(10) decreased by 19% from pre-COVID to active COVID, but post-COVID pollutant concentration has seen a 23% increase. Air pollutants show a positive correlation with COVID-19 cases among which PM(2.5), PM(10) and NO(2) show a strong correlation during active COVID-19 cases. Metrological factors such as minimum temperature, average temperature and humidity show a positive correlation with COVID-19 cases while maximum temperature, wind speed and air pressure show no strong positive correlation. Although the COVID-19 pandemic had numerous negative effects on human health and the global economy, the reduction in air pollution and significant improvement in ambient air quality likely had substantial short-term health benefits; the government must implement policies to control post-COVID environmental issues.","Bhatti, Uzair Aslam; Zeeshan, Zeeshan; Nizamani, Mir Muhammad; Bazai, Sibghatullah; Yu, Zhaoyuan; Yuan, Linwang",Chemosphere,567,18

COVID-19 pandemic is spreading all over the world with the number of infected cases increased to 54.4 million with 1.32 million deaths. Different types of statistical models have been developed to predict viral infection and multiple studies have compared the performance of these predictive models, but results were not consistent. This study aimed to develop and provide easy to use model to predict the Covid-19 infection severity in the patients and to help understanding the patient’s condition. METHODS: This study analyzed simulated data obtained from the large database for 340 patients with an active Covid-19 infection. The study identified predictors of Covid-19 outcomes that may be measured in two different ways: the total T-cell levels in the blood with T-cell subsets and number of cells in the blood infected with virus. All measures are relatively unobtrusive as they only require a blood sample, however there is a significant laboratory cost implications for measuring the number of cells infected with virus. This study used methodological approach using two different methods showing how multiple regression and logistic regression can be used in the context of Covid-19 longitudinal data to develop the prediction models. RESULTS: This study has identified the predictors of Covid-19 infection outcomes and developed prediction models. In the regression model of Total_T Cell, the predictors BMI, comorbidity and Total_Tcell were all associated with increased levels of infection severity (p < 0.001). For BMI, the mean % of unhealthy cells increased by 0.42 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.60) and comorbidity predictor has on average 8.3% more unhealthy liver cells than without comorbidity (95% CI – 2.9% - 1.29%). The results of multivariate logistic regression model predicting the Covid-19 Infection severity were promising. The significant predictors were observed such as Age (OR 0.95, p = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.91 – 0.99), Helper T_cells (OR O.93, p = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.87 – 0.99), Basic_Tcell (OR 1.11, p = 0.001, 95% CI: 1.06 -1.71) and Comorbidity (OR 0.41, p = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.16 – 1.07). CONCLUSIONS: In this study recommendation has been provided to clinical researchers on the best way to use the various Covid-19 infections measures along with identifying other possible predictors of Covid-19 infection. It is imperative to monitor closely the T-cell subsets using prediction models that might provide valuable information about the patient’s condition during the treatment process.","Ansari, Rashid M.; Baker, Peter",J Infect Public Health,567,20

Digital technologies may offer an innovative way to support the mental health needs of women and their families throughout the perinatal period, as well as assist midwives in the recognition of perinatal mental health concerns. However, little is known about the acceptability and perceived benefits and barriers to using such technologies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a mixed methods evaluation of the current state of perinatal mental health care provision in the United Kingdom, as well as users’ (women and partners) and midwives’ interest in using a digital mental health assessment throughout the perinatal period. METHODS: Women, partners, and midwives were recruited to participate in the study, which entailed completing an online survey. Quantitative data were explored using descriptive statistics. Open-ended response data were first investigated using thematic analysis. Resultant themes were then mapped onto the components of the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation Behavior model and summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 829 women, 103 partners, and 90 midwives participated in the study. The provision of adequate perinatal mental health care support was limited, with experiences varying significantly across respondents. There was a strong interest in using a digital mental health assessment to screen, diagnose, and triage perinatal mental health concerns, particularly among women and midwives. The majority of respondents (n=781, 76.42%) expressed that they would feel comfortable or very comfortable using or recommending a digital mental health assessment. The majority of women and partners showed a preference for in-person consultations (n=417, 44.74%), followed by a blended care approach (ie, both in-person and online consultations) (n=362, 38.84%), with fewer participants preferring online-only consultations (n=120, 12.88%). Identified benefits and barriers mainly related to physical opportunity (eg, accessibility), psychological capability (eg, cognitive skills), and automatic motivation (eg, emotions). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides proof-of-concept support for the development and implementation of a digital mental health assessment to inform clinical decision making in the assessment of perinatal mental health concerns in the United Kingdom.","Martin-Key, Nayra Anna; Spadaro, Benedetta; Schei, Thea Sofie; Bahn, Sabine",J Med Internet Res,567,12

Using country-level data on 40 SSA countries from 1996 to 2014 and rainfall deviations as an instrument for agricultural official development assistance (ODA) in fixed-effect estimation settings, this paper examines the ‘instantaneous’ impact of agricultural ODA on agricultural fixed capital formation in SSA. The question here is whether aid to agriculture does translate instantaneously to building fixed capital urgently needed to address the effect of any potential crisis on food insecurity. Measuring agricultural fixed capital as fixed investments in farm machinery, dams, industrial buildings for agricultural and agro-processing, fences, ditches, drains, etc., we find that capital formation in SSA agriculture improves instantaneously with agricultural ODA inflows. Second, we find that even though rainfall deviations are associated with agricultural ODA inflows to SSA, institutions particularly those designed to control corruption and strengthen rule of law, do matter for agricultural aid inflows to SSA. These results suggest that agricultural ODA is necessary to accelerate agricultural investments and achieve food security. Our results are robust to sensitivity analysis on the specification of the instantaneous model.","Asiedu, Edward; Sadekla, Sylvester S.; Bokpin, Godfred A.",World Dev Perspect,567,29

The pharmacological burden may be further aggravated by the addition of treatments for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the risk of potential DDIs upon admission and during hospitalisation in patients with COVID-19 treated at our hospital. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 502 patients with COVID-19 (mean age 61 ± 16 years, range 15–99) treated at our hospital with a proven diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalised between 21 February and 30 April 2020 and treated with at least two drugs. RESULTS: Overall, 68% of our patients with COVID-19 were exposed to at least one potential DDI, and 55% were exposed to at least one potentially severe DDI. The proportion of patients experiencing potentially severe DDIs increased from 22% upon admission to 80% during hospitalisation. Furosemide, amiodarone and quetiapine were the main drivers of potentially severe DDIs upon admission, and hydroxychloroquine and particularly lopinavir/ritonavir were the main drivers during hospitalisation. The majority of potentially severe DDIs carried an increased risk of cardiotoxicity. No potentially severe DDIs were identified in relation to tocilizumab and remdesivir. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalised patients with COVID-19, concomitant treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine led to a dramatic increase in the number of potentially severe DDIs. Given the high risk of cardiotoxicity and the scant and conflicting data concerning their efficacy in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection, the use of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19 with polypharmacy needs to be carefully considered.","Cattaneo, Dario; Pasina, Luca; Maggioni, Aldo Pietro; Giacomelli, Andrea; Oreni, Letizia; Covizzi, Alice; Bradanini, Lucia; Schiuma, Marco; Antinori, Spinello; Ridolfo, Annalisa; Gervasoni, Cristina",Drugs Aging,567,33

METHODS: In order to compare saliva and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, we designed a meta-analysis searching in PubMed up to December 29th, 2020 with the key words “(SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID-19 OR COVID19) AND (salivary OR saliva OR oral fluid)) NOT (review[Publication Type]) NOT (PrePrint[Publication Type])” applying the following criteria: records published in peer reviewed scientific journals, in English, with at least 15 nasopharyngeal/orapharyngeal swabs and saliva paired samples tested by RT-PCR, studies with available raw data including numbers of positive and negative tests with the two sampling methods. For all studies, concordance and sensitivity were calculated and then pooled in a random-effects model.

We apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of 211,000 human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with panels extending to 228 antibodies to construct a multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. Multimodal analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states, allowing us to identify and validate previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Hence, vaccines have been taken as the best option for controlling the transmission of the disease. Although the approved COVID-19 vaccines have proven to be safe and effective, multiple beliefs and misconceptions still exist influencing its acceptance. OBJECTIVE: To assess the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine and determinant factors among chronic patients visiting Dessie Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northeastern Ethiopia. METHODS: Institution-based cross-sectional study design was used among patients with chronic diseases visiting Dessie Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from May 1 to 20, 2021 using a consecutive sampling technique. Binary logistic regression analysis using crude odd ratio (COR) and adjusted odd ratio (AOR) was performed to assess the association between independent and dependent variables. Variables having p values of less than 0.05 at the 95% confidence interval (CI) were considered as factors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. RESULTS: A total of 416 respondents participated in the survey, with a response rate of 98.6%. About 59.4% of the respondents were willing to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. Participants who had health insurance (AOR=1.812; 95% CI: 1.703–3.059), knew anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 (AOR=2.482; 95% CI: 1.427–4.317), having good knowledge of the COVID-19 vaccine (AOR=6.890; 95% CI: 3.900–120.17), and having a positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine (AOR=7.725; 95% CI: 4.024–14.830) were factors affecting the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine. CONCLUSION: The acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine was low. Use of health insurance, knowing anyone who had been diagnosed with COVID-19, knowledge, and attitude towards the COVID-19 vaccine were factors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Healthcare professionals should conduct continuous awareness creation campaigns on the importance of the COVID-19 vaccine, safety, and its efficacy. Further studies like longitudinal and qualitative studies should be conducted to identify additional barriers to vaccine acceptance particularly in high-risk groups.","Berihun, Gete; Walle, Zebader; Berhanu, Leykun; Teshome, Daniel",Patient Prefer Adherence,567,17

The antibodies were minimally mutated from germline and were derived from different B cell lineages. Only two antibodies displayed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus. The most potent antibody bound the RBD in a manner that prevented binding to the ACE2 receptor, while the other bound outside the RBD. Our study indicates that the majority of antibodies against the viral envelope spike that were generated during the first weeks of COVID-19 infection are non-neutralizing and target epitopes outside the RBD. Antibodies that disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 spike-ACE2 interaction can potently neutralize the virus without undergoing extensive maturation. Such antibodies have potential preventive/therapeutic potential and can serve as templates for vaccine-design. IN BRIEF SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to expansion of diverse B cells clones against the viral spike glycoprotein (S). The antibodies bind S with high affinity despite being minimally mutated. Thus, the development of neutralizing antibody responses by vaccination will require the activation of certain naïve B cells without requiring extensive somatic mutation.

The catastrophic socio-economic impacts of this intervention could outweigh its benefits if the timing and duration of implementation are left uncontrolled and ill-strategized. Here we investigate the dynamics of social distancing on age-stratified US population and benchmark its effectiveness in reducing the burden on hospital and ICU beds. Our findings highlight the diminishing marginal benefit of social distancing, characterized by a linear decrease in medical demands against an exponentially increasing social distancing duration. We determine an optimal intermittent social-to-no-distancing ratio of 5:1 corresponding to ~80% reduction in healthcare demands; beyond this ratio, benefit of social distancing diminishes to a negligible level.

We assessed prevalence of mental disorders and associated factors during the first wave of the pandemic among healthcare professionals in Spain. Methods: All workers in 18 healthcare institutions (6 AACC) in Spain were invited to a series of online surveys assessing a wide range of individual characteristics, COVID-19 infection status and exposure, and mental health status. Here we report: current mental disorders (Major Depressive Disorder-MDD- [PHQ-8 [≥] 10], Generalized Anxiety Disorder-GAD- [GAD-7 [≥] 10], Panic attacks, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder -PTSD- [PCL-5 [≥] 7]; and Substance Use Disorder -SUD-[CAGE-AID[≥]2]. Severe disability assessed by the Sheehan Disability Scale was used to identify ""disabling"" current mental disorders. Results: 9,138 healthcare workers participated. Prevalence of screen-positive disorder: 28.1% MDD; 22.5% GAD, 24.0% Panic; 22.2% PTSD; and 6.2% SUD. Overall 45.7% presented any current and 14.5% any disabling current mental disorder. Healthcare workers with prior lifetime mental disorders had almost twice the prevalence of current disorders than those without. Adjusting for all other variables, odds of any disabling mental disorder were: prior lifetime disorders (TUS: OR=5.74; 95%CI 2.53-13.03; Mood: OR=3.23; 95%CI:2.27-4.60; Anxiety: OR=3.03; 95%CI:2.53-3.62); age category 18-29 years (OR=1.36; 95%CI:1.02-1.82), caring ""all of the time"" for COVID-19 patients (OR=5.19; 95%CI: 3.61-7.46), female gender (OR=1.58; 95%CI: 1.27-1.96) and having being in quarantine or isolated (OR= 1.60; 95CI:1.31-1.95). Conclusions: Current mental disorders were very frequent among Spanish healthcare workers during the first wave of COVID-19.

The negative effect of the lockdown is more conspicuous among the less-educated workers than the highly-educated workers. Because Asian Americans are more likely to have a bachelor or higher degree than any other racial group, they are expected to be relatively immune to the drop in employment unless the detrimental impact of the lockdown is severer for Asian Americans. Exploiting the panel aspect of the Current Population Survey – Merged Outgoing Rotation Group, we examine the changes in At-work status before and after the lockdown and between the lockdown and months of the reopening. The empirical results uncover that Asian Americans are more negatively affected by the lockdown than any other racial group, net of education, immigration status, and other covariates. Surprisingly, the negative impact of the lockdown is entirely concentrated on less-educated Asian Americans. Regardless of gender, less-educated Asian Americans are substantially more likely to lose employment than equally educated Whites and are not more likely to regain employment during the reopening months. Other less-educated racial minorities do not experience more reduction in At-work status than Whites, net of covariates.

Trois autres résidents avaient une gale ; et résidents et personnels ont reçu IVM 200μg/kg J0–J7 (n = 121). Retour de la résidente-1 à l’EHPAD-A le 17/03 (plan blanc). Étude épidémiologique : Les cas probables ou confirmés (PCR) de COVID-19 de l’EHPAD-A entre 5/03 et 15/05 ont été identifiés, facteurs de risque, sévérité et mortalité précisés. Durant cette période, les infections COVID-19 et décès des autres EHPAD du 77 étaient déclarés à l’ARS.

Résultats Soixante-neuf résidents (incluant résidente-1) et 52 personnels EHPAD-A ont reçu l’IVM : âge médian résidents 90 ans (84–94), 78,3 % femmes, 98,6 % au moins une comorbidité à risque de COVID-19 sévère. 11 sujets présentaient une COVID-19 probable ou certaine (7/69 résidents et 4/52 personnels, fréquence 10,1 %). Parmi les résidents, 90,9 % (10/11) ont eu une COVID-19 minime, sans oxygène ou hospitalisation, aucun mort. Parmi les 177 EHPAD du 77, 45 étaient inclus comme contrôles, soit 3062 résidents (âge médian 86,2 ans, 77,3 % femmes).

Low-dose computed tomography (CT) detects pulmonary infiltrates with high sensitivity, but findings may be non-specific. This study assesses the diagnostic value of SARS-CoV-2 serology for patients with distinct CT features but negative PCR. METHODS: IgM/IgG chemiluminescent immunoassay was performed for 107 patients with confirmed (group A: PCR + ; CT ±) and 46 patients with suspected (group B: repetitive PCR-; CT +) COVID-19, admitted to a German university hospital during the pandemic’s first wave. A standardized, in-house CT classification of radiological signs of a viral pneumonia was used to assess the probability of COVID-19. RESULTS: Seroconversion rates (SR) determined on day 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 after symptom onset (SO) were 8%, 25%, 65%, 76% and 91% for group A, and 0%, 10%, 19%, 37% and 46% for group B, respectively; (p < 0.01). Compared to hospitalized patients with a non-complicated course (non-ICU patients), seroconversion tended to occur at lower frequency and delayed in patients on intensive care units. SR of patients with CT findings classified as high certainty for COVID-19 were 8%, 22%, 68%, 79% and 93% in group A, compared with 0%, 15%, 28%, 50% and 50% in group B (p < 0.01). SARS-CoV-2 serology established a definite diagnosis in 12/46 group B patients. In 88% (8/9) of patients with negative serology > 14 days after symptom onset (group B), clinico-radiological consensus reassessment revealed probable diagnoses other than COVID-19. Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 serology was superior to PCR > 17d after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-third of patients with distinct COVID-19 CT findings are tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by PCR rendering correct diagnosis difficult. Implementation of SARS-CoV-2 serology testing alongside current CT/PCR-based diagnostic algorithms improves discrimination between COVID-19-related and non-related pulmonary infiltrates in PCR negative patients. However, sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 serology strongly depends on the time of testing and becomes superior to PCR after the 2(nd) week following symptom onset.","Schneider, Jochen; Mijočević, Hrvoje; Ulm, Kurt; Ulm, Bernhard; Weidlich, Simon; Würstle, Silvia; Rothe, Kathrin; Treiber, Matthias; Iakoubov, Roman; Mayr, Ulrich; Lahmer, Tobias; Rasch, Sebastian; Herner, Alexander; Burian, Egon; Lohöfer, Fabian; Braren, Rickmer; Makowski, Marcus R.; Schmid, Roland M.; Protzer, Ulrike; Spinner, Christoph; Geisler, Fabian",Respiratory research,567,20

HCoV-NL63 is typically associated with mild upper respiratory symptoms in children, elderly and immunocompromised individuals. It has also been shown to cause severe lower respiratory illness. NL63 shares ACE2 as a receptor for viral entry with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Here we present the in situ structure of HCoV-NL63 spike (S) trimer at 3.4-Å resolution by single-particle cryo-EM imaging of vitrified virions without chemical fixative. It is structurally homologous to that obtained previously from the biochemically purified ectodomain of HCoV-NL63 S trimer, which displays a 3-fold symmetric trimer in a single conformation. In addition to previously proposed and observed glycosylation sites, our map shows density at other amino acid positions as well as differences in glycan structures. The domain arrangement within a protomer is strikingly different from that of the SARS-CoV-2 S and may explain their different requirements for activating binding to the receptor. This structure provides the basis for future studies of spike proteins with receptors, antibodies, or drugs, in the native state of the coronavirus particles.","Zhang, Kaiming; Li, Shanshan; Pintilie, Grigore; Chmielewski, David; Schmid, Michael F.; Simmons, Graham; Jin, Jing; Chiu, Wah",bioRxiv,567,28

We sought to review the literature to appraise the clinicians on these outcomes. METHODS: A literature search using the specific keywords was carried out in the database of PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar up till December 11, 2020 applying Boolean method. Full text of all the relevant articles that reported the outcomes of ADA in patients with T2DM and COVID-19 were retrieved. Subsequently, an appraisal of literature report was narratively presented. RESULTS: Available studies that reported the outcomes of ADA are either case series or retrospective cohorts or prospective observational studies, in absence of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Results from these observational studies suggest that amongst all the non-insulin ADA, metformin users prior to the hospitalization had improved outcomes compared to the non-users. Data for dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) are encouraging although inconsistent. No documentation of any harm or benefit has been observed for sulfonylureas (SUs), sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). No data is yet available for pioglitazone. CONCLUSION: Metformin and DPP-4i should be continued in patients with T2DM until hospitalization or unless contraindicated. No evidence of harm suggests that SUs, SGLT-2i or GLP-1RAs may not be stopped unless very sick, hospitalized or contraindicated. The results from RCTs are needed to claim any meaningful benefit with either metformin or DPP-4i in patients with T2DM and COVID-19.","Singh, Awadhesh Kumar; Singh, Ritu; Saboo, Banshi; Misra, Anoop",Diabetes Metab Syndr,567,7

During the last decades, projects including telemedicine are being implemented worldwide. However, implementation of telemedicine is in some countries, e.g., Germany somewhat slower compared to northern European countries. One important part of successful implementation is to include the citizen perspective. The aims of this study were to explore the perception of representatives of the local government regarding telemedicine in the context of a perceived GP shortage and to tailor future telemedicine offers according to these perceived needs. METHODS: Considering the multidisciplinary assessment suggested by the Model for Assessment of Telemedicine a questionnaire with 19 questions was developed by identifying determinants of telemedicine out the literature. After pre-testing, the questionnaire was sent to all 2199 mayors from the federal states of Schleswig-Holstein (North Germany) and Baden-Württemberg (South Germany) as representatives of the citizens (cross- sectional study; full population survey). The final questionnaire contained sections for socio-demographic data, telemedicine and perceived GP shortage. All responses from November 2018 until 2019 were included and analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: The response rate was 32% (N = 699), of which 605 were included in the analysis. A majority of the participants stated they live in a rural area and 46% were in the office for up to 8 years. The mayors had predominantly a positive perception about telemedicine (60%) and 76% of them stated, their community would benefit from telemedicine. A GP shortage was reported by 39% of the participants. The highest risk of telemedicine was seen in misdiagnosing. In case of an emergency situation 291 (45%) of the participants considered data privacy as not as relevant. Mayors from a community with a perceived GP shortage had a more negative perception regarding telemedicine. CONCLUSION: The acceptance of telemedicine is rapidly rising compared to former studies. Communities with a perceived GP shortage had a more negative perception. Barriers like data security concerns were seen as less important in case of an emergency. The highest risk of telemedicine was seen in misdiagnosing. These findings need to be considered in designing future telemedicine offers.

Children aged 18 years or younger with microbiologically confirmed SARS CoV 2 infection were included. Findings 409 children were included, with a median age of 53.0 years (IQR 0.6 9.0). Of these, 95 191 (23.2%) were diagnosed with MIS C. 191 (46.7%) children were admitted to hospital and 52 (12.7%) required admission to a Pediatric Intensive Care Unite (PICU). 92 (22.5%) patients required oxygen support: 8 (2%) were started on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and 29 (7%) on mechanical ventilation. 35 (8.5%) patients required inotropic support. The following factors were associated with PICU admission: pre-existing medical condition (P < 0.0001), immunodeficiency (P = 0.01), lower respiratory tract infection (P< 0.0001), gastrointestinal symptoms (P = 0.006), radiological changes suggestive of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (P< 0.0001), low socioeconomic conditions (P 0.009). Conclusions This study shows a generally more severe form of COVID 19 and a high number of MIS C in Latin American children, compared with studies from China, Europe and North America, and support current evidence of a more severe disease in Latin/Hyspanic children or in people of lower socioeconomic level. The findings highlight an urgent need of more data of COVID 19 in South America.","Antunez-Montes, O. Y.; Escamilla, M. I.; Figueroa-Uribe, A.

Primary rat alveolar type II cells were transdifferentiated into the type I cell phenotype. Type I cells were productively infected with SDAV and RCoV-P, and both live virus and UV-inactivated virus induced mRNA and protein expression of three CXC chemokines: CINC-2, CINC-3, and LIX, which are neutrophil chemoattractants. Dual immunolabeling of type I cells for viral antigen and CXC chemokines showed that chemokines were expressed primarily by uninfected cells. Virus-induced chemokine expression was reduced by the IL-1 receptor antagonist, suggesting that IL-1 produced by infected cells induces uninfected cells to express chemokines. Primary cultures of alveolar epithelial cells are an important model for the early events in viral infection that lead to pulmonary inflammation.","Miura, Tanya A.; Wang, Jieru; Holmes, Kathryn V.; Mason, Robert J.",Virology,567,16

Laboratory and observational data suggested that hydroxychloroquine had biological activity against SARS-CoV-2, potentially permitting its use for prevention. OBJECTIVE: To test hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: Household-randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of hydroxychloroquine postexposure prophylaxis. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04328961) SETTING: National U.S. multicenter study. PARTICIPANTS: Close contacts recently exposed (<96 hours) to persons with diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection. INTERVENTION: Hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/d for 3 days followed by 200 mg/d for 11 days) or ascorbic acid (500 mg/d followed by 250 mg/d) as a placebo-equivalent control. MEASUREMENTS: Participants self-collected mid-turbinate swabs daily (days 1 to 14) for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. The primary outcome was PCR-confirmed incident SARS-CoV-2 infection among persons who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at enrollment. RESULTS: Between March and August 2020, 671 households were randomly assigned: 337 (407 participants) to the hydroxychloroquine group and 334 (422 participants) to the control group. Retention at day 14 was 91%, and 10 724 of 11 606 (92%) expected swabs were tested. Among the 689 (89%) participants who were SARS-CoV-2 negative at baseline, there was no difference between the hydroxychloroquine and control groups in SARS-CoV-2 acquisition by day 14 (53 versus 45 events; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.66]; P > 0.20). The frequency of participants experiencing adverse events was higher in the hydroxychloroquine group than the control group (66 [16.2%] versus 46 [10.9%], respectively; P = 0.026). LIMITATION: The delay between exposure, and then baseline testing and the first dose of hydroxychloroquine or ascorbic acid, was a median of 2 days. CONCLUSION: This rigorous randomized controlled trial among persons with recent exposure excluded a clinically meaningful effect of hydroxychloroquine as postexposure prophylaxis to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SARS-CoV-2 binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface and this complex is internalized. ACE2 serves as an endogenous inhibitor of inflammatory signals associated with four major regulator systems: the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), the complement system, the coagulation cascade, and the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS). Understanding the pathophysiological effects of SARS-CoV-2 on these pathways is needed, particularly given the current lack of proven, effective treatments. The vasoconstrictive, prothrombotic and pro-inflammatory conditions induced by SARS-CoV-2 can be ascribed, at least in part, to the activation of these intersecting physiological networks. Moreover, patients with immune deficiencies, hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and kidney disease often have altered activation of these pathways, either due to underlying disease or to medications, and may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Certain characteristic COVID-associated skin, sensory, and central nervous system manifestations may also be linked to viral activation of the RAAS, complement, coagulation, and KKS pathways. Pharmacological interventions that target molecules along these pathways may be useful in mitigating symptoms and preventing organ or tissue damage. While effective anti-viral therapies are critically needed, further study of these pathways may identify effective adjunctive treatments and patients most likely to benefit.","Curran, Colleen S.; Rivera, Donna R.; Kopp, Jeffrey B.",Front Pharmacol,567,0

Special attention is given to the author's work on experimental dual infections with PRRSV and other enzootic porcine respiratory viruses. It was concluded that: (1) Studies on the interactions of PRRSV and its target cell, the pulmonary alveolar macrophage, are very scarce. So far, the hypothesis of impaired macrophage function has not been proven. (2) The possibility that PRRSV causes disease in growing pigs in combination with other viral or bacterial infections has been demonstrated experimentally. Variation in disease resulting from such combined PRRSV infections will probably hamper future research into disease mechanisms.

Evidence of lyssavirus circulation has recently emerged in Southeast Asian bats. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Thailand to assess rabies-related knowledge and practices among persons regularly exposed to bats and bat habitats. The objectives were to identify deficiencies in rabies awareness, describe the occurrence of bat exposures, and explore factors associated with transdermal bat exposures. METHODS: A survey was administered to a convenience sample of adult guano miners, bat hunters, game wardens, and residents/personnel at Buddhist temples where mass bat roosting occurs. The questionnaire elicited information on demographics, experience with bat exposures, and rabies knowledge. Participants were also asked to describe actions they would take in response to a bat bite as well as actions for a bite from a potentially rabid animal. Bivariate analysis was used to compare responses between groups and multivariable logistic regression was used to explore factors independently associated with being bitten or scratched by a bat. FINDINGS: Of 106 people interviewed, 11 (10%) identified bats as a potential source of rabies. A history of a bat bite or scratch was reported by 29 (27%), and 38 (36%) stated either that they would do nothing or that they did not know what they would do in response to a bat bite. Guano miners were less likely than other groups to indicate animal bites as a mechanism of rabies transmission (68% vs. 90%, p = 0.03) and were less likely to say they would respond appropriately to a bat bite or scratch (61% vs. 27%, p = 0.003). Guano mining, bat hunting, and being in a bat cave or roost area more than 5 times a year were associated with history of a bat bite or scratch. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate the need for educational outreach to raise awareness of bat rabies, promote exposure prevention, and ensure appropriate health-seeking behaviors for bat-inflicted wounds, particularly among at-risk groups in Thailand.","Robertson, Kis; Lumlertdacha, Boonlert; Franka, Richard; Petersen, Brett; Bhengsri, Saithip; Henchaichon, Sununta; Peruski, Leonard F.; Baggett, Henry C.; Maloney, Susan A.; Rupprecht, Charles E.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,567,16

Prognostic tool is essential in the contingency response for the next wave of outbreak. This study aims to develop prognostic models to predict COVID-19 patients’ clinical outcome on day 1 and day 5 of hospital admission. METHODS: We did a retrospective analysis of a complete cohort of 1037 COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed patients in Hong Kong as of 30 April 2020, who were admitted to 16 public hospitals with their data sourced from an integrated electronic health records system. It covered demographic information, chronic disease(s) history, presenting symptoms as well as the worst clinical condition status, biomarkers’ readings and Ct value of PCR tests on Day-1 and Day-5 of admission. The study subjects were randomly split into training and testing datasets in a 8:2 ratio. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was used to classify the training data into three disease severity groups on Day-1 and Day-5. RESULTS: The 1037 patients had a mean age of 37.8 (SD ± 17.8), 53.8% of them were male. They were grouped under three disease outcome: 4.8% critical/serious, 46.8% stable and 48.4% satisfactory. Under the full models, 30 indicators on Day-1 and Day-5 were used to predict the patients’ disease outcome and achieved an accuracy rate of 92.3% and 99.5%. With a trade-off between practical application and predictive accuracy, the full models were reduced into simpler models with seven common specific predictors, including the worst clinical condition status (4-level), age group, and five biomarkers, namely, CRP, LDH, platelet, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and albumin/globulin ratio. Day-1 model’s accuracy rate, macro-/micro-averaged sensitivity and specificity were 91.3%, 84.9%/91.3% and 96.0%/95.7% respectively, as compared to 94.2%, 95.9%/94.2% and 97.8%/97.1% under Day-5 model. CONCLUSIONS: Both Day-1 and Day-5 models can accurately predict the disease severity. Relevant clinical management could be planned according to the predicted patients’ outcome.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the associations between bacterial, viral, and bacterial plus viral isolations and bronchiectasis exacerbations. METHODS: In this prospective study, we enrolled 108 patients who were followed up every 3–6 months and at onset of exacerbations between March 2017 and November 2018. Spontaneous sputum was split for detection of bacteria (routine culture) and viruses (quantitative polymerase chain reaction). Symptoms and lung function were assessed during exacerbations. RESULTS: The median exacerbation rate was 2.0 (interquartile range: 1.0–2.5) per patient-year. At any visit, viral isolations (V+) occurred more frequently during onset of exacerbations [odds ratio (OR): 3.28, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.76–6.12], as did isolation of new bacteria (NB+) (OR: 2.52, 95%CI: 1.35–4.71) and bacterial plus viral isolations (OR: 2.24, 95%CI: 1.11–4.55). Whilst coryza appeared more common in exacerbations with V+ than in exacerbations with no pathogen isolations and those with NB+, lower airway symptoms were more severe in exacerbations with NB+ (P < .05). Sputum interleukin-1β levels were higher in exacerbations with NB+ than in exacerbations with no pathogen isolations and those with V+ (both P < .05). Significantly more coryza symptoms correlated with bacterial plus viral isolations at exacerbations (P = .019). Compared with V+ alone, bacterial with and without viral isolations tended to yield more severe lower airway symptoms, but not sputum cytokine levels at exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS: Viral isolations, isolation of new bacteria and bacterial plus viral isolation are associated with bronchiectasis exacerbations. Symptoms at exacerbations might inform clinicians the possible culprit pathogens.","Chen, Chun-Lan; Huang, Yan; Yuan, Jing-Jing; Li, Hui-Min; Han, Xiao-Rong; Martinez-Garcia, Miguel Angel; de la Rosa-Carrillo, David; Chen, Rong-chang; Guan, Wei-Jie; Zhong, Nan-Shan",Arch Bronconeumol,567,1

This study reports on the deposition of polyvinylpyrrolidone/antibiotic/isoflavonoid thin films by the matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE) method as anti-adhesion barrier coatings, on biomedical surfaces for improved resistance to microbial colonization. The thin films were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, infrared microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. In vitro biological assay tests were performed to evaluate the influence of the thin films on the development of biofilms formed by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. In vitro biocompatibility tests were assessed on human endothelial cells examined for up to five days of incubation, via qualitative and quantitative methods. The results of this study revealed that the laser-fabricated coatings are biocompatible and resistant to microbial colonization and biofilm formation, making them successful candidates for biomedical devices and contact surfaces that would otherwise be amenable to contact transmission.","Grumezescu, Valentina; Negut, Irina; Cristescu, Rodica; Grumezescu, Alexandru Mihai; Holban, Alina Maria; Iordache, Florin; Chifiriuc, Mariana Carmen; Narayan, Roger J.; Chrisey, Douglas B.",Molecules,567,6

We studied the correlation between Ct values and disease severity and mortality at our hospital;. All patients with RT PCR diagnosed COVID 19 illness admitted at the study site and for whom Ct values were available were included in the study. The patients with mild disease had significantly lower Ct values than patients with severe disease but had also been tested significantly earlier in the illness than those with severe disease. The patients who died had significantly lower Ct values than patients who survived but here again they had significantly shorter duration of symptoms before testing. We therefore recommend that the time of testing since onset of symptoms should be controlled for while correlating Ct values with disease severity.,"Shah, Sweta; Singhal, Tanu; Davar, Namita; Thakkar, Pooja",Indian J Med Microbiol,567,1

After drying, there was no significant difference in inactivation rates between variants.

In this study, we compared direct rRT-PCR method (without RNA extraction) using SeeGene AllplexTM 2019-nCoV rRT-PCR with the RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR kit (Altona Diagnostics). Furthermore, we assessed the impact of swab storage media composition on PCR efficiency. We show that SeeGene and Altona's assays provide similar efficiency. Importantly, we provide evidence that RNA extraction can be successfully bypassed when samples are stored in UTM medium or in molecular water but not when samples are stored in saline solution and in Hanks medium.","Merindol, Natacha; Pépin, Geneviève; Marchand, Caroline; Rheault, Marylène; Peterson, Christine; Poirier, André; Houle, Claudia; Germain, Hugo; Danylo, Alexis",J Clin Virol,567,16

We performed a systematic literature search using PubMed/Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases to identify COVID-19-associated TTS case reports and evaluated patient-level demographics, clinical attributes, and outcomes. There are 12 cases reported of TTS associated with COVID-19 infection with mean age of 70.8 ± 15.2 years (range 43–87 years) with elderly (66.6% > 60 years) female (66.6%) majority. The time interval from the first symptom to TTS was 8.3 ± 3.6 days (range 3–14 days). Out of 12 cases, 7 reported apical ballooning, 4 reported basal segment hypo/akinesia, and 1 reported median TTS. Out of 12 cases, during hospitalization, data on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was reported in only 9 of the cases. The mean LVEF was 40.6 ± 9.9% (male, 46.7 ± 5.7%, and female, 37.7 ± 10.6%). Troponin was measured in all 12 cases and was elevated in 11 (91.6%) without stenosis on coronary angiography except one. Out of 11 cases, 6 developed cardiac complications with 1 case each of cardiac tamponade, heart failure, myocarditis, hypertensive crisis, and cardiogenic shock in 2. Five patients required intubation, 1 patient required continuous positive airway pressure, and 1 patient required venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The outcome was reported in terms of recovery in 11 (91.6%) out of 12 cases, and a successful recovery was noted in 10 (90.9%) cases. COVID-19-related TTS has a higher prevalence in older women. Despite a lower prevalence of cardiac comorbidities in COVID-19 patients, direct myocardial injury, inflammation, and stress may contribute to TTS with a high complication rate.","Singh, Sandeep; Desai, Rupak; Gandhi, Zainab; Fong, Hee Kong; Doreswamy, Shriya; Desai, Virmitra; Chockalingam, Anand; Mehta, Puja K.; Sachdeva, Rajesh; Kumar, Gautam",SN Compr Clin Med,567,1
